Annual Report 2016 5 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Preface I am pleased to present this report, which summarises the work of the Committee on Toxicity (COT) during 2016. The COT assesses chemicals for their potential to harm human health. Evaluations are carried out at the request of the Food Standards Agency, Department of Health, Public Health England, and other Government Departments and Regulatory Authorities, and are published on the Internet as statements or shorter position papers. Details of membership, agendas and minutes are also published on the Internet. During 2016, the Committee held six meetings. The Committee continued its review of the risks to infants and young children from a variety of contaminants, based on new information on exposure, some of which wa s from the 2014 Survey of Metals and Other Elements in Infant Foods. Contaminants reviewed included arsenic, acrylamide, lead, aluminium, nickel, Work on arsenic, acrylamide, lead and aluminium was completed during the year, and statements were published on these topics. Work on PBDEs, HBCDDs and nickel will be completed in 2017. The Committee also reviewed risks to infants and young children from iodine and vitamin A in the diet. This work will be completed in 2017. The Committee continued its evaluation of a series of systematic reviews on the role of the infant diet and the development of atopic and autoimmune disease. It also reviewed the results of a related study funded by the FSA: EAT - A randomized trial of the early introduction of allergenic foods in breastfed infants . The Committee finalised its work on hydrolysed cows' milk formulae and on the t iming of introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet. Statements were published o n these topics. Work on the remaining aspects will be completed in 2017. As part of this, a joint working group of COT and SACN was established to undertake a benefit -risk assessment of the timing of introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet to enable consensus advice to be provided to government. This work will be completed in 2017. The contents of the systematic reviews have been published in the peer reviewed literature or will be submitted for publication in due course. The Committee update d its consideration of the risks from potassium -based replacements for sodium chloride. The combined sub -group with SACN completed its benefit -risk assessment, to ensure the advice provided adequately reflects both the positive and negative consequences o f replacement of sodium salt with potassium salt. A joint report on this benefit -risk assessment will be finalised and published in 2017. The Committee commenced work on evaluating the absolute and relative risks from the use of electronic nicotine delive ry systems (e -cigarettes) and novel heat -not-burn tobacco products. In the first instance COT undertook scoping reviews of these products and identified follow -up work for consideration at future meetings. Work on heat -not-burn products will be completed i n 2017. The Committee also discussed concerns arising from the use of shisha pipes in public spaces. Annual Report 2016 6 The joint COT/COC Synthesising Epidemiological Evidence Sub -group was established in 2015 to review the approaches to synthesising epidemiological eviden ce used by the committees in their chemical risk assessments and to make recommendations to the committees on guidance . The sub -group has now finalised its proposed guidance and recommendations, for consideration by COC and COT. The committees will concl ude this work in 2017. The COT participated in an FSA ad hoc working group: Developing Proportionate Controls for Risky Foods . The working group developed a framework for this purpose which was considered and adopted by the FSA Board. The Framework has b een published on the FSA website. The COT provided comments to the EFSA on its updated draft guidance on the use of the benchmark dose . The Committee discussed several scientific areas of potential relevance, including emerging non -animal methods for tox icity testing and their rans- , endocrine disrupting chemicals, and the microbiome. A watching brief will be kept on these topics for developments relevant to the work of the Committee and updates will be provided as appropriate. 2016 saw the passing of a former member (2008 -2010), Dr Cliff Elcombe. Dr Elcombe's expertise and research contributions were invaluable to the work of the Committee and he will be sadly m issed. During 2016, Ms Frances Pollitt's attended her last meeting as the PHE Scientific Secretary, as she was retiring. I thank her for all of the work she did in supporting the work of the Committee and wish her well for the future. The Committee welco med Ms Britta Gadeberg as the new PHE Scientific Secretary in 2016 . A member of the Committee, Prof David Harrison, was appointed to the Chair of the Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC). I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success in t he role. I would like to thank all members of the Committee and the secretariat for their support and hard work over the year. It helped make my task as chair much easier. Professor A Boobis (Chairman) OBE PhD CBiol FRSB FBTS FBPhS Annual Report 2016 7 COT evaluations Acrylamide in the diet of infants and young children 1.1 The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is undertaking a review of scientific evidence that will inform the Government's dietary recommendations for infants (0 to 12 months) and young children (1 to 5 years). The COT was asked to review the risks of toxicity from chemicals in the diet of infants. This document gives an overview of the potential risks from acrylamide. There are currently no Government dietary recommendations for infants and young children relat ing to acrylamide. 1.2 Acrylamide forms naturally in starchy food products during cooking at high temperature s, such as frying, baking, roasting and also during industrial processing . Its presence in food was first reported in 2002 , although it is very likely that it has been present in food since cooking began. Acrylamide also has industrial uses, particularly in the production of polyacrylamide . Acrylamide is present in tobacco smoke. 1.3 The key toxicological effects of acrylam ide in laboratory studies are: - changes in the genetic material of cells; - induction of cancer; - damage to the nervous system; - alterations in the male reproductive system . 1.4 Although t he results of human studies provide no reliable evidence that acrylamide causes cancer in humans, based on what i s known about the way it causes cancer in animals it is possible that it could also cause cancer in humans. 1.5 The COT assessed t he possible health risks arising from acrylamide exposure from different sources . Acrylam ide has the potential to pass from the mother's blood into breast milk, but only at very low levels, which are unlikely to represent a risk to the breast -fed infant. 1.6 For infant formula and foods eaten by infants and young children, the assessment indicate d a potential concern for cancer risk as in other age groups. However the currently available scientific information does not allow quantification of any risk. The levels in food do not indicate a concern for the other effects of acrylamide such as those o n the nervous system or reproductive system. 1.7 The major sources of dietary exposure to acrylamide include potatoes (particularly home cooked potatoes), other cooked vegetables and cereal -containing foods (such as breakfast cereals and sweet biscuits). Dieta ry acrylamide exposure of infants and young children in the UK is similar to that in other European countries. Annual Report 2016 8 1.8 There have been efforts in the UK and Europe to reduce concentrations of acrylamide in food over recent years, but the evidence so far is not su fficient to demonstrate whether these have resulted in a decrease in dietary exposure. Therefore, efforts to reduce acrylamide exposure should be continued, with respect to both home cooked and commercially produced food. 1.9 Acrylamide concentrations in soil, water and air are low and therefore exposures from these sources are likely to be low in comparison to dietary exposure. There is a lack of information on potential exposure of infants and young children from some other sources; for example exposure from passive smoking could be an important contributor for some children. The COT statement is available here: https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finalacr ylamidestatement.pdf Aluminium in the diet of infants and young children 1.10 The Committee on Toxicity (COT) were asked by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) to review the risks of toxicity from chemicals in the diet of infants (age 0 -12 months) and young children (aged 1 -5 years). The COT issued a statement in 2013 on the potential risks from aluminium in the infant diet [http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/statealuminium.pdf]. In 2016, the COT issued an addendum to its 2013 statement, which exte nded the assessment to young children and updated the assessment for infants, based on the most recent data on exposure [https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finalaluminiumaddendum.pdf]. 1.11 This lay summary has been updated to provide an overview of the information in the two COT documents. 1.12 Infants and young children may be exposed to aluminium compounds through inhalation of dust, ingestion of soil and from the diet. Use of aluminium -containing cosmetic products is unlikely in this age group. 1.13 Alumini um is present in the diet as a result of its natural occurrence in foods, its presence in drinking water (either naturally or from water treatment) that is used to reconstitute infant formula or consumed directly, and possibly through contact with food con tainers such as cans, cookware, utensils and food wrappings. In addition, although aluminium -containing food additives are not permitted in infant formulae or processed foods for infants, they may be present in some foods fed to infants, and additional alu minium may come from the use of aluminium -containing food contact materials in the home. Annual Report 2016 9 1.14 Aluminium is taken up from the gut, but absorption is low (generally 0.5% of intake or less). The presence of citrate (citric acid) in some foods, increases absorption . No data are available on the absorption of aluminium specifically in infants or young children. There is evidence that aluminium accumulates in the human body with levels in tissues tending to increase with age. The primary route by which aluminium is el iminated from the body is urinary excretion. Since kidney function is not fully developed at birth, lower rates of elimination would be expected in infants than in adults 1.15 The main toxic effects of aluminium are on the brain and nervous system and on the ki dney, although these have not been shown conclusively to result from dietary exposure in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 2 mg/kg body weight (expressed as aluminium) for all alumin ium compounds in food, including food additives. The COT considers that the derivation of this PTWI was sound and that it should be used in assessing potential risks from dietary exposure to aluminium. The PTWI is a level of intake below which there is rea sonable confidence that consumption every week over a lifetime would not cause harm to health. 1.16 The COT has estimated exposure to aluminium based on levels in breast milk, infant formula, water, food, and soil reported in the scientific literature or in Food Standards Agency surveys, together with data on consumption by infants and young children. Th e combined exposure from these different sources were also considered. 1.17 Dietary exposures of all age groups up to 5 years were well below the PTWI and do not indicate any toxicological concern. This includes exposure through soya -based infant formula and ot her soya drinks used in older infants and children, which contain higher levels of aluminium than non soya -based foods. 1.18 Combined exposures from breast milk, diet (including water), and soil/dust are up to almost 3 times the PTWI. This is due to the high le vels of aluminium present in soil and the assumption that similar levels might also be present in dust. Taking into account that much of the aluminium in soil is likely to be less well absorbed into the body than that in food, and that the PTWI was establi shed from a study on aluminium citrate, which is a more readily absorbed form of aluminium, these exceedances of the PTWI are not clearly of concern. 1.19 Overall, the estimated exposures of infants and young children to aluminium from the dietary sources that have been considered do not indicate toxicological concerns or a need for modified Government advice. The 2013 COT statement can be found at: http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/statealuminium.pdf The 2016 addendum can be found at: https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finalaluminiumaddendum.pdf Annual Report 2016 10 Arsenic in the diet of infants and young children 1.20 The SACN is reviewing the scientific evidence that bears on the Government's dietary recommendations for infants and young children. The COT was asked to review the risks of toxicity from chemicals in the diet of infants (aged 0 -12 months) and young children (aged 1 -5 years). This statement addresses the risks from arsenic in the diet of these age groups. There is one Government dietary recommendation for infants and young children relating to arsenic, specifying that toddlers and young children (aged 1 to 4.5 years) s hould not be given rice drinks as a substitute for breast milk, infant formula or cows' milk. This is due to the potential for rice drinks to contain high levels of arsenic. Furthermore, cows' milk or alternatives are not suitable as drinks for infants und er 12 months old . 1.21 Arsenic occurs in the environment in a variety of organic and inorganic forms1 as the result of natural and human activity. As it is widely accepted that inorganic arsenic compounds are more toxic than organic arsenic compounds, the COT focused its review on the potential risks from exposure to inorganic arsenic. Where specific information was not available, it was assumed that all arsenic present in that source of exposure was in the inorganic form. 1.22 People are exposed to inorganic arsenic through food, drinking water, air, soil and dust; infants and young children can also be exposed through breast milk and infant formula. Food and water are generally the major sources of exposure to inorganic arsenic. 1.23 The amount of arsenic taken up from t he gut varies depending on the chemical form, its solubility, and the material (e.g. type of food) in which it is present. Once absorbed, inorganic arsenic is rapidly cleared from the blood and widely distributed throughout the body before being metabolise d and eliminated via urinary excretion. 1.24 The effects of inorganic arsenic depend on total exposure from all sources. Long - term exposure to inorganic arsenic can cause skin lesions, and cancer of the lung, urinary bladder, and skin. Consequently, it is important to consider combined exposures throughout life from food, water, and non -dietary sources. However, dietary sources generally contribute more to total exposure than non -dietary sources such as soil and dust. Exposures from air are considered negli gible. Therefore efforts to reduce the levels of inorganic arsenic in food and water should continue. 1.25 The Committee considered the possible risks from exposures of UK infants and young children to inorganic arsenic from different dietary sources. For infan ts aged 1In this context, the term organic refers to the forms of arsenic that are commonly found in fish, seafood and other marine organisms. Annual Report 2016 11 0 to 4 months old who are fed only on breast milk, ready -to-feed formula, and powder formula made with water containing typical inorganic arsenic concentrations, exposures were considered of low concern. There could be a small risk when powder form ula is prepared with water containing inorganic arsenic at the upper end of the concentration range in public water supplies. It was not possible to estimate likely exposures in those relying on private water supplies, as suitable information was not avail able. Similarly, with the introduction of complementary feeding, there could be a small risk for some older infants and young children, particularly when water contains higher levels of inorganic arsenic. 1.26 The Committee concluded that the estimates of expos ure to inorganic arsenic from rice drinks support the advice not to use rice drinks as a substitute for breast milk, infant formula or cows' milk, and that this advice should therefore remain in place. However, consumption of up to 50 mL of rice drink per day by those aged 1 -5 years would not make much difference to total dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic. 1.27 The Committee also assessed exposure to inorganic arsenic from the consumption of infant and 'adult' rice cakes by those aged 0 to 5 years, and concl uded that neither would result in an increased risk. The 2016 COT statement can be found at: https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finalstatementonarsenic.pdf Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDDs) in the diet of infants and young children 1.28 The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is reviewing the scientific evidence that bears on the Government's dietary recommendations for infants and young children. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) was asked to review the risks of toxicity from chemicals in the diet of infants (aged 0 -12 months) and young children (aged 1 -5 years). The COT issued a statement on the possible risks from hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDDs) in the infant diet in 2015. In 2016, the COT issued an addendum to its 2015 statement, which extended the assessment to young children and updated the assessment for infants, based on the most recent data on exposure. This lay summary has been updated to provide an overview of the information in the two COT documents. 1.29 Technical mi xtures of HBCDDs have been widely used as flame retardants incorporated in polymers and textiles, construction materials, furniture, and electrical equipment. By international agreement, the use of HBCDDs for all but construction purposes was banned in 201 4. However HBCDDs are environmentally persistent, and exposures will continue to occur for some time following the ban. Annual Report 2016 12 1.30 Infants and young children can be exposed to HBCDDs through their presence in breast milk as well as other foods. In older infants and young children, swallowed domestic dust is also a source of exposure to HBCDDs. 1.31 HBCDDs cause toxic effects on the liver, thyroid hormones, and reproductive and nervous systems in experimental animals. Only limited data are available from studies of HBCDDs in human populations, and they do not allow a meaningful assessment of risks at the levels to which we are exposed through food. 1.32 The available toxicological data are insufficient to establish safety guidance values for HBCDDs, and the COT concluded that it was more appropriate to consider the ratios between the highest doses that had been found not to cause adverse effects in animal studies and the estimated exposures of infants and young children. Such ratios are known as \"margins of exposure\", and their interpretation should take into account uncertainties in the toxicological database, in the extrapolation from animals to humans, and in the estimation of exposure. 1.33 There are a number of uncertainties in the assessment so a generally conservative approach is taken. 1.34 Overall the analysis indicated that estimated exposure s via breast milk and food , including infant formula and commercially produced infant foods, are not a cause for concern . No data are available on potential exposures in the UK from drinking water. New data on HBCDD levels in dust have been published since the 2015 statement. Average (median) and high (97.5th percentile) levels of HBCDDs in dust are not a cause for concern but sporadic extremes, which might be found in a few houses, could be. 1.35 Given that most uses of HBCDDs are being phased out, and that the main source of exposure to residual environmental HBCDDs is ingested domestic dust, the priority for further research is continued monitoring of HBCDDs levels in house dust to ensure that th ey are declining as expected. The 2015 COT statement can be found at: https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/HBCDDsstatementfinal.pdf The 2016 COT statement adde ndum can https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finaladdendumonhbcdds.pdf Histamine in Histamine (scombrotoxin ) poisoning is a well -established phenomenon arising from consumption of foods most notably scombroid fish, such as fresh tuna and anchovies and fermented fish products, which have become contaminated with the biogenic amine histamine as a result of bacter ial spoilage. Although the Annual Report 2016 13 concerns about histamine toxicity initially related to fish, biogenic amines such as histamine also occur in fermented products such as cheese or sausage with the FSA having received a number of incident reports related to exces s levels of histamine in cheese over the last few years. 1.28 The symptoms of scombrotoxin (histamine) poisoning include flushing, headache, nausea, itching, rash, palpitations and altered blood pressure. 1.29 The histamine levels in scombroid fish and fermented fish products are controlled by legislation which specifies the maximum concentration(s) of histamine that can occur in batches of fish. However, the histamine levels in other foods are not covered by any specific legislation. 1.30 In the absence of specific legislation, the FSA gives advice on histamine incidents on a pragmatic basis, taking into account a number of factors . These include the likely exposure (concentration of histamine and quantity consumed) , and the specific population group concerned , with advice reflecting previous experience related to incidents in fish, and the results of volunteer studies of histamine. In 2011, EFSA set a reference dose of 50 mg/meal for biogenic amines; this has also been incorporated into the FS A advice. 1.31 The COT was asked to comment on the EFSA opinion and the current FSA approach to incidents involving histamine in cheese . The Committees concluded that: The effects of histamine poisoning can be quite severe and unpleasant but we re short -lived. Analysis of d ata from incidents involving histamine in cheese that were dealt with by the FSA , show that most of the individuals in whom symptoms of poisoning were reported were toddlers and young children. It is unclear whether this observation is evidence that young children are more sensitive to the effects of exogenous histamine, or whether the data had been subject to reporting bias (i.e. as multiple children were affected simultaneously, the likelihood of a diagnosis of histamine poisoning w as increased). In general the cheese involved in such incidents tended to be mature and produced by larger manufacturers, rather than by artisan producers. The ARfD (50 mg of histamine per meal per healthy adult) that was e stablished by the EFSA Panel, was sensible and conservative. It was adequately protective as it had been based on the responses of healthy and sensitive ind ividuals . Although the ARfD did not take into account the possible modulation of histamine sensitivity by other factors such as m edication, management of such risks may be better achieved through education of consumers or patients, as is done in the case of tyramine. Annual Report 2016 14 The FSA's approach to assessing the risk from histamine in cheese was sensible and well -founded as it took into acc ount the appropriate measures of exposure, including data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), and adjusted the EFSA ARfD for toddlers and children by scaling for bodyweight. It is appropriate to build on the risk assessment already establis hed for biogenic amines in fish, but it would be prudent for the FSA to adopt a case -by-case approach when considering histamine in cheese. There is currently too much heterogeneity in the levels of histamine in cheese to establish an 'action' or guidance level that could inform the FSA's approach to risk assessments. Hydrolysed cows' milk formulae : role in influencing the development of atopic outcomes and autoimmune disease 1.36 The COT were asked for their opinion on a systematic review looking at the use of hydrolysed cows' milk formulae in infants at a high risk of developing atopic outcomes or autoimmune disease. This review was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and will be used to direct future policy in this area. 1.37 The COT agreed that the use of hydrolysed infant formula did not reduce the risk of developing atopic outcomes or autoimmune disease in high -risk infants. The 2016 COT statement can be found at: https://cot.food.gov.uk/cotstatements/cotstatementsyrs/cot -statement -on-hydrolysed -cows - milk-formulae Irritant sprays COT previously reviewed the safety -in-use of irritant sprays containing pelargonyl vanillylamide (nonivam ide, or PAVA) or 2 -chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) in various solvents (in 1998, 1999, 2005 , 2013 and 2015 ), and considered combined exposure to PAVA and sprays in 2006. In 2016, the COT provided advice on a reformulated PAVA irritant spray. This was taken as reserved business as it contained commercially -sensitive information. Lead in the diet of infants and young children 1.39 The Committee on Toxicity (COT) were asked by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) to review the risks of toxic ity from chemicals in the diet of infants (aged 0 -12 months) and young children (aged 1 -5 years). The COT issued a statement in 2013 on the potential risks from lead in the infant diet [http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotstatlead.pdf]. In 2016, the COT issued an addendum to its 2013 statement, which extended the assessment to young children and updated the assessment for infants, based on the most recent data on exposure [https://admin.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/finaladdendumonlead.pdf].This lay Annual Report 2016 15 summary ha s been updated to provide an overview of the information in the two COT documents. 1.40 People are exposed to lead through food, drinking water, air, soil and dust. Food and water are the major sources of exposure to lead, although in infants and young children , ingestion of soil and dust can also contribute importantly. In addition, lead can be transferred to the infant from the mother in breast milk. Exposure to lead in the UK has decreased substantially over recent decades. 1.41 The proportion of ingested lead whi ch is absorbed into the body is higher in children than in adults. Inadequate intakes of calcium, iron and zinc have been shown to increase lead absorption, and higher levels of fat in the diet may lead to higher blood levels of lead. 1.42 Absorbed lead is tran sported in the blood, and then deposited in soft tissues and bone, where it tends to accumulate with age. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, calcium in the mother's bones is released to meet the needs of her baby, and this results also in the release of l ead from the bone. 1.43 Concerns about adverse effects from lead in the diet and environment relate principally to long -term cumulative exposures. The kidney and cardiovascular systems can be adversely affected by lead exposure in adults. However, epidemiologic al studies have demonstrated effects on the brain at lower levels of exposure, and the developing brain is more vulnerable than the mature brain. In particular, there is strong evidence that lead can impair intelligence (as measured by IQ). It has not been possible to demonstrate a threshold level of exposure below which adverse effects on the infant brain are absent. 1.44 The Committee concluded that assessment of the potential risks from exposure of infants and young children to lead should be made by referenc e to an exposure value of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, which the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had estimated would produce less than a 1 point decrement in IQ. Exposure below this value indicates that the health risk is small. 1.45 The Committee calculated estimates of exposure of UK infants and young children to lead from different sources and compared them to the exposure value identified by EFSA. For infants aged 0 to 6 months old who are fed breast milk, ready to feed drinks and powder formula made with water containing typical lead concentrations, any risk would be small. A small risk cannot be ruled out for infants of this age exclusively fed on infant formula prepared with water containing lead at the upper end of the concentra tion range of lead in public water supplies. It was not possible to estimate likely exposure in those relying on private water supply. Annual Report 2016 16 1.46 For older infants, and for young children, any risk from diet alone will also be small. However, the effects of lead wil l depend on total exposure to lead from all sources so it is important to consider combined exposures from food, water, and also non - dietary sources. When the possible contribution from soil and dust is taken into account, a risk at the population level an d to some infants and young children cannot be ruled out. Exposures from air are negligible. 1.47 There are a number of uncertainties in the assessment of risks from lead exposure and generally conservative assumptions have been made in estimating risk. The COT previously noted the decreasing trends in dietary exposure to lead and blood lead levels in recent decades. Nevertheless, the absence of an identified threshold for neurodevelopmental effects of lead and the exposures identified in this assessment emphas ise the need for continued efforts to control lead in the environment . The 2013 COT statement can be found at: http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotstatlead.pdf The 2016 diphenylethers (PBDEs) in the diet of infants andyoung children 1.48 The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is reviewing the scientific evidence that bears on the Government's dietary recommendations for infants and young children. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) was asked to review the risks of toxicity from chemicals in the diet of infants (aged 0 -12 months) and young children (aged 1 -5 years). The COT issued a statement on the possible risks from polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the infant diet in 2015 1.49 A discussion paper TOX/2016/22 provided estimates of PBDE exposures for chidren in the UK aged 1 -5 years and also an updated exposure assessment for infants aged 0 to 12 months as new data had become available since the 2015 COT statement. These estimates were drafted into an addendum to the COT 2015 statement along with comments regarding whether levels of PBDEs were increasing or decreasing in European Union countries since their ban. The addendum to statement will be finalised in 2017 Timing of introduc tion of allergenic foods to the infant diet and influence on the risk of development of atopic outcomes and autoimmune disease 1.50 The COT were asked for their opinion on a systematic review looking at the timing of introduction of allergenic foods into the i nfant diet and the influence on the risk Annual Report 2016 17 of developing atopic outcomes and autoimmune disease. This review was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and will be used to direct future policy in this area. The COT also considered the results from the EAT study2, also commissioned by the FSA and included as part of the systematic review. 1.51 The COT agreed with the findings of the systematic review that for egg and peanut allergy, early introduction (at 4 -6 months for egg and 4 -11 months for peanut) of these two foods reduces subsequent development of an allergy to that food. The 2016 COT statement can be consultation on draft guidance document on the use of the benchmark dose in risk assessment 1.52 The C OT was invited to comment on this draft guidance document and m ore generally the benchmark dose (BMD) approach and its implications for the work of the Committee . The draft guidance document was an edited update of the previous EFSA guidance document on benchmark dose modelling, which had been p ublished in 2009. The key changes were largely to the methodology, and were primarily on the way that models were used and assessed for goodness of fit; the use of model averaging; and describing how to use either the benchmark dose software (BMDS) develop ed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or PROAST which was developed by the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). 1.53 Members considered the document clear and useful to understand how benchmark dose mo delling results were calculated and used. Members recognised that benchmark dose modelling was scientifically superior to the use of the no - observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL). However, one advantage of the NOAEL approach was that since the NOAEL had to be one of the dose levels tested, most experts would agree the same value for the NOAEL. Since different benchmark dose models might be used, with different judgements on whether to constrain the models, and different uses of model averaging, different sci entific committees and bodies might arrive at different reference points, losing consistency between these committees/bodies. Transparency was needed, and it was pointed out that the 2 Perkin et al (2016) Randomized trial of introduction of allergenic foods in breast -fed infants. NEJM 374 1733 -43. Annual Report 2016 18 draft guidance document provided a template for reporting benchmark dose modelling results. 1.54 The Committee noted the conclusion of the document that study guidelines should be changed to increase the number of dose levels tested without increasing the total number of animals used in the experiment. It had been argued that no statistical power is lost when using the same number of animals over more dose groups. However, while this was the case for dose -response modelling, the power would be reduced for hazard identification in the case of low potency substances. In addition, if n o effects were observed then benchmark dose modelling could not be performed whereas it would still be possible to identify a NOAEL. 1.55 It was agreed that the Committee itself would not submit a response to the consultation. However, Members were encouraged t o respond to the consultation individually if they had any comments Horizon s canning 1.56 At their February 2016 meeting, the COT were invited to consider emerging or developing topics of importance within the COT remit, which might be included in future agen das for detailed discussion. Members noted the list of agenda items that were planned or underway for 2016, and discussed several other topics that might also be considered. 1.57 The Committee considered that since there was much current research activity in read across and predictive toxicology (e.g. Tox21 and ToxCast in the USA; SURAT 1 and EU -ToxRisk in the EU ; OECD adverse outcome pathway program ), and which was likely to influence the future of toxicity testing a workshop in this area would be useful. The C ommittee noted there was a need for an international consensus on how best to determine the validity of in vitro methods for risk assessment since the current validation process was increasingly considered to be too slow. 1.58 The Committee noted that the application of physiologically based toxicokinetic modelling (PBTK) in risk assessment had shown little recent progress, although there were some developments, such as a tool for non -expert use, and in -house modelling by the ph armaceutical industry. It was agreed that the COT would keep a watching brief on this topic. 1.59 Members agreed that a systematic review of the health effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs ) would be useful but recognised that this would be a major task. A similar task had been conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO ) but more focussed questions would have been helpful . Without a coordinated systematic review to understand the evidenc e base (possibly an Annual Report 2016 19 \"umbrella\" review of reviews to obviate author selection bias) the impact of EDCs was uncertain . In the first instance, Members agreed that a paper on the evidence gaps would be helpful; this would be prepared by PHE. 1.60 The COT decided th at it would be timely to review the toxicity of both nicotine - containing and nicotine -free electronic delivery systems. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory A gency (MHRA) ha d licenced at least one nicotine -containing product. However, most prod ucts were currently largely unregulated, but this would change with implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive, in May 2016. The aspects related to carcinogenicity could be worked on jointly with COC and COM, while COT could consider the added flavou rings and exposure to vapours and particulates, including bystander exposure. A r isk-benefit assessment of E-cigarettes would not be within the COT remit. Update on the COT 2008 Trans and multigenerational toxicity statement 1.61 Members no ted that the knowledge base trans and multigenerational toxicity had moved on since the last COT statement was published in 2008. The COT agreed that the statement should be updated, with input from PHE as appropriate. 1.62 The COT agreed that since the importan ce of the mi crobiome in many areas of health and disease was becoming increasingly apparent , the effects of xenobiotics on the microbiota and of the microbiota on xenobiotics should be considered . Both the makeup of the microbiological population , i.e. the species of bacteria and other microorganisms present, and its functional makeup, i.e. the biochemical pathways contributed by the total mass of microorganisms, sh ould be taken into account, along with other potential interactions, for example between air pollution, microorganisms in the respiratory tract and the development of asthma. Balance of expertise on the Committee 1.63 It was confirmed that the following types of specialist expertise are required by the Committee for some or all of its evaluations: Analytical te chniques Biochemistry Bioinformatics Biomonitoring Cell biology Clinical practice Dietary exposure assessment Endocrinology Environmental exposure assessment Epigenetics Epidemiology Human toxicology Immunology Mathematical Modelling Mechanistic toxicology Molecular biology Neurotoxicology Nutrition Occupational health epidemiology Paediatrics Annual Report 2016 20 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacology Probabilistic modelling Reproductive toxicology Respiratory toxicology Risk assessment Statistical aspects of experimental design Statistics Systems biology Toxicogenomics Toxicological pathology Xenobiotic metabolism 1.64 It would not be necessary to have an individual member for each listed expertise as some people would have a combination of the required skills. Additional key experts are also invited to attend meetings for specific topics to supplement missing expertise . Peer review by EU -ANSA agencies 1.65 Due to the there being insufficient time for discussion, Members were requested to send in any comments on this paper by email. If required, this item could be brought back to the next meeting for a full Committee discussion. Working Groups COT/COC Subgroup on synthesising epidemiological evidence 1.66 The COT and COC set up a subgroup to review the approaches to synthesising epidemiological evidence that are used by the Committees in chemical risk assessments and to make recommendations for COT/COC guidance. The terms of reference are to provide guidanc e that can be used by expert advisory committees for synthesis of epidemiological evidence, to review recent practice by expert advisory committees for synthesis of epidemiological evidence, with a focus on systematic reviews, to identify key points of cur rent best practice methodologies used in systematic review and meta -analysis, and to identify and make recommendations for areas requiring further work. Further information on the subgroup can be found at: http://cot.food.gov.uk/cotwg/cot -coc-epi-sub-group . The subgroup is expected to complete its work in 2017. COT/SACN Subgroup on potassium -based replacement for sodium chloride and sodium based additives 1.67 The COT and SACN set up a subgroup to prepare integrated risk benefit advice on potassium replacements for sodium chloride and sodium based additives. Further information on the sub group can be found at: Annual Report 2016 21 http://cot.food.gov.uk/cotwg/joint -sacn/cot -potassium -based -sodium -replacers -working - group . The subgroup is expected to complete its work in 2017. COT/SACN Subgroup on the timing of introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet 1.68 A joint COT and SACN subgroup was set up to consider the risk -benefit advice on the timing of introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet and the development of atopic outcomes or autoimmune diseases. This subgroup is expected to complete i ts work in 2017. Ongoing work Developmental toxicity and the uncertainty factor for interspecies extrapolation 1.69 The Committee had considered papers on this topic in 2013 and 2014 . It had agreed that a paper should be produced for publication in a peer -reviewed journal. A short COT statement could then be produced, based on the paper. The Committee considered further the development of a paper on this topic in 2015 and advised on the approach to take. It requested that a toxico logist and an epidemiologist should be sought as collaborators to evaluate the data critically for the identified candidate chemicals . 1.70 The COT did not discuss this topic further in 2016. It is anticipated that the Committee will consider a draft manuscri pt in 2017. Maternal and infant dietary exposures and risk of development of atopic outcomes and autoimmune disease 1.71 The COT was asked for their opinion on a systematic review looking at maternal and infant dietary exposures and the development of atopic outcomes or autoimmune disease. This review was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and will be used to direct future polic y in this area. 1.72 This item is ongoing as the contractors are yet to publish their findings in the peer - reviewed literature Annual Report 2016 22 Potential risks from electronic nicotine (or non -nicotine) device systems in users and non -users (bystanders): a focused overview 1.73 During the horizon scanning session in 2016, the Committee agreed that possible human health effects of electronic cigarettes was a topic of concern that should be evaluated by the Committee. A scoping paper was subsequently discussed. This work will be take n forward in 2017 after the discussion of novel tobacco products. Survey of metals and other elements in infant foods 1.74 In 2014, the FSA completed a survey of 15 metals and other elements in infant formula, commercial infant foods, and other foods (i.e. those which were not specifically manufactured or intended for infants and young children but were known to be or could be consumed by them such as bread, fruit and vegetables). The results of the FSA's survey had provided information on the concentrations of aluminium, antimony, arsenic (including inorganic arsenic), cadmium, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, tin and zinc in these foods. Based on these concentration data, and food consumption data from the Diet and Nutrition Survey of Infants and Young Children (DNSIYC), dietary exposures to these elements had been estimated for UK infants and young children aged 4 to 18 months. 1.75 Discussion paper TOX/2016/29 provided the aforementioned concentration data and exposure estimates, alongside brief summaries of the toxicology of each element and comparisons of the exposure estimates with the relevant health - based guidance values. A statement will be finalised in 2017 and a Food Surveillance Information Sheet (FSIS) will be drafted by the FSA with a view to publishing later in 2017; the FSIS will incorporate the COT's comments and conclusions. Toxicity of chemicals in the infant diet and the diet of young children aged 1 to 5 years 1.76 The COT has been asked to consider aspec ts of the toxicity of chemicals in the diet of infants and of young children aged 1 to 5 years, in support of the SACN review of Government recommendations on complementary and young child feeding. The COT reviews aim to identify whether current advice is appropriate in relation to potential toxicity, or whether there is a need for new or revis ed advice. Between 2012 and 2016 statements had been produced for a number of chemicals in relation to the infant diet. Reviews of vitamin A, iodine and nickel commen ced in 2016 and will continue in 2017 . Further evaluation will also be conducted. Annual Report 2016 23 Toxicological evaluation of novel heat -not-burn commercial products: 1.77 COT has been requested by DH and PHE to assess the risk of novel tobacco products to provide a general opinion on the absolute and relative toxicological risks of these types of product. A scoping paper was discussed in 2016 and further work will be undertaken on this topic in 2017. The item is being taken as reserved business as the Committee has been pr ovided with commercially sensitive information.

The COM would be happy to receive any feedback from readers of this report. The Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) provides advice on potential mutagenic activity of specific chemicals at the request of UK Government Departments and Agencies. Such requests generally relate to chemicals for which there are incomplete, non -standard or controversial data sets for which independent authoritative advice on potential mutagenic hazards and risks is required. Recommendations for further studies are, on occasions, made. The Committee also advises on important general principles and on new scientific work related to the assessment of mutagenic risk and makes recommendations on mutagenicity testing. The membership of the Committee, declarations of their interests, agendas and minutes of meetings, and statements are all published on th e internet. https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/committee -on-mutagenicity -of-chemicals -in-food- consumer -products -and-the-environment During 2016, the a number of topics: the genotoxicity of parachloroaniline, assays used to evaluate germ cell DNA integrity, germ cell Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) and a scoping paper on human germ cell mutagens. It discussed recent work on epigenetics and the potential transgenerational effects of Vinclozolin. It commented upon a systematic review on the health effects of emissions to air from municipal waste incinerators. It began a consideration of new quantitative approaches being proposed for the assessment of genotoxicity data. The Committee also carried out its annual Horizon scanning exercise, identifying a number of potential topics for future work. The COM is interested in obtaining information f rom Government Departments on how its advice is acted upon. Throughout 2016 the COM continued to take an active interest in the work of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) on test guidelines. It commented on the OECD's review of old test guidelines (TGs) and the development of new TG's. It also commented on the OECD's Guidance Document on Revisions to OECD Genetic Toxicology Test Guidelines. The COM also discussed the possible implications of Brexit on its work and noted that there was uncertainty in how this may affect the regulatory environment and the UK's relationship with international organisations. I am again grateful for the support of the secretariat and the Department of Health Toxicology Unit, who maintained their usual high standard of work despite the difficulties and uncertainties throughout the year and to the members of the committee for their expert advice and support throughout the year. Dr D Lovell Chair PhD BSc (Hons) FBS CStat 2016 34 COM Evaluations MUT/2016/01 Assays used to evaluate germ cell DNA integrity in human fertility investigations 2.1 COM had previously considered germ cell mutation assays, the paternal age effect (an increase in mutations in aging human sperm) and a paper on r adiation induced transgenerational effects. As part of the review the suggestion that air pollution should be classified as a human germ cell mutagen was noted and it was decided to perform a review of the literature to examine this claim. During the lit erature review it was noted that many studies of the effects of air pollution utilised assays for DNA integrity developed for use in assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Their use as markers of DNA damage in human sperm had not been validated and ther efore it was considered appropriate for the COM to assess these assays before addressing the claim that air pollution is a germ cell mutagen. 2.2 The paper provided an overview of the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) and end labelling) assays and their potential for investigating germ cell mutagenesis in humans. It was noted that both the SCCA and the TUNEL detect DNA strand breaks and therefore should be considered only as indicator assays. It was considered that they did not inform on the consequences of the DNA damage; whether they lead to a mutation or apoptosis; or whether damage would be repaired. It was not clear whether the reported reduced fertility was due to a genotoxic or toxic effe ct. It was noted that the two assays measured different types of DNA stand breaks and may not be directly comparable. It was possible that the observed DNA fragmentation could have arisen as a result of chemical induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, or ano ther process not involving genotoxicity. There also appeared to be a relatively high background level which would make it difficult to detect a chemically induced increase in DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, it was not clear at what point in spermatogenesis the DNA damage occurs. 2.3 The COM considered that these assays may provide some evidence of chemically induced DNA damage, but there were a number of uncertainties which made both the SCSA and the TUNEL assays difficult to interpret in terms of germ cell mutagenicity. For example, there was a lack of consistency between some of the data and the test methods used; uncertainty over the underlying biology leading to the formation of DNA strand breaks and resultant downstream effects; a large variation in back ground levels and a lack of validation of the test methods. It would be useful to harmonise these methodologies and for the validation of these assays to be undertaken prior to their use in evaluating human germ cell mutagenicity. MUT/2016/02 Germ cell adverse outcome pathways 2.4 COM had been made aware of recent papers by a group from Health Canada regarding adverse outcome pathways (AOP) for germ cell endpoints (Yauk et al. 2015 Annual Report 2016 35 Environ.Mol.Mut 56(9) 724 -50 and Marchetti et al. 2015 Environ.Mol.Mut 57 (2) 87 -113) and these were evaluated as part of the ongoing review of germ cell mutagenesis. An individual AOP is developed for a specific molecular initiating event, is not chemical specific and has key toxicological effects, which should be measurable. 2.5 The DNA alkylation AOP (Yauk et al., 2015) focused on premeiotic germ cell DNA alkylation using ethylnitrosourea as a model alkylating agent. Unique features of germ cells suggest that they should be considered separately from somatic cells. The AOP makes the assumption that the processes of DNA repair and damage are conserved across eukaryotic cells. The tubulin binding AOP (Marchetti et al. 2015) used colchicine as a model example, the majority of evidence is generated from rodents. It was noted that benzimidazoles induce this AOP. 2.6 COM agreed that the two AOPs provided were very specific and more qualitative than quantitative but provide a useful framework for capturing and clarifying information obtained from systems biology approaches. They also provide frameworks to aid in the communication of mode of actions, but further development was required before they could be used in chemical safety evaluation. It was noted that one of the main difficulties was that there was no consensus on terminology across toxicology disciplines which would need to be addressed; it was noted that systems biology may facilitate this, as it already had a number of agreed terms. 2.7 COM agreed that currently, AOPs could not be used to evaluate mixtures of chemicals or in risk assessment. It was noted that the COM 2007 statement on benzimidazoles, where a 'common mechanism' of toxicity had been identified used terminology a little different to that used in the AOP but that there were sufficient similarities and that the statement remained valid and did not need updating. It was agreed that COM would keep a watching brief on the development of AOPs for mutagenicity. MUT/2016/04 Draft discussion paper: MUT/2016/05 Epigenetics 2.9 Transgenerational epigenetics was first examined by the COM in 2006 when the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) had requested an opinion on a paper investigating the pesticide vinclozolin. The topic was raised again during a Horizon scanning exercises and the COM expressed an interes t in examining the topic further, particularly with regards to the impact on risk assessment strategies. 2.10 Dr Emma Marczylo (PHE), presented details and discussion of a recent literature review carried out by PHE and the associated publication (Marczylo E et al., 2016. Critical Reviews in Toxicology ) which evaluated environmentally induced epigenetic changes. Firstly she addressed the role of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, particularly highlighting stages that might be vulnera ble to epigenetic changes; Dr Marczylo also examined current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity Annual Report 2016 36 from human cohort studies and animal (rodent) studies. This included adverse outcomes, such as reproductive toxicity, developmental toxici ty, metabolic disorders and behavioural changes. The third part of the review considered how potential epigenetic toxicity may affect public health. This included potential implications for regulatory toxicology. 2.11 Regarding the future, Dr Marczylo suggeste d that more research was required. Improved human bio -monitoring of chemical exposure may help determine the levels of chemicals that humans are exposed to environmentally before establishing whether relevant effects occur at these levels. There was also a need for improved molecular study designs to identify mechanisms for transgenerational effects using additional models (e.g. zebra fish), and to understand the normal variation of epigenetic change. Depending on such information, future test guidelines including epigenetic endpoints could be developed, which may be useful and could have benefits in terms of the 3Rs (reduction, replacement, refinement of animal use). For example, early epigenetic markers of adverse effect may result in a study being stopp ed early and no further testing being needed. Epigenetics: The Transgenerational Effects Of Vinclozolin (MUT/2016/05) 2.12 The COM also considered a paper which provided an overview of epigenetics and studies specifically investigating the transgenerational effects of vinclozolin, which had been published since the last review (MUT/2016/05). A number of studies which had demonstrated a variety of vinclozalin induced effects using a dosing protocol of high intraperitoneal doses (100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant r ats on days 8 -14 of gestation were evaluated together with others using which had aimed to examine these findings. The COM noted that the epigenetic changes observed following the use of inconsistent methods (including different doses and different timing of doses) and different animal crosses made comparison difficult. 2.13 The studies using very high doses and intraperitoneal administration were not considered to be relevant to human environmental exposure. Different time points of exposure could be impor tant because methylation patterns change 'naturally' over time in response to environmental pressures. It was noted that some of the results could be an artefact from the use of outbred animals and variation in the strains of animals use. Furthermore, inconsistencies may be the consequence of researchers investigating specific or novel aspects of the research and not necessarily due to an underlying inconsistency in results or findings. 2.14 COM noted that it will be important to identify and separate out th e key epigenetic changes that could lead to adverse effects from the large 'natural' variation. The identification of epigenetic biomarkers and endpoints was also considered important. There is a need for greater reproducibility and consistency within studies (i.e. validation) and COM suggested that some currently available assays could be used or adapted, although it was agreed that it was not likely that existing test guidelines would be changed to include epigenetic endpoints in the foreseeable futur e. It was suggested that it would be useful to create a 'safe harbour' for epigenetic data that could receive data from industry, similar to that created for 'omics' data by the USA Food and Drug Administration. This could be made available, facilitating a broad evaluation which could allow regulatory Annual Report 2016 37 bodies and industry to determine what endpoints and types data may be useful and which could be realistically obtained and added to existing toxicity studies. 2.15 The COM also noted that it was important to consider other chemical groups that can be added to DNA, rather than just methyl groups (e.g. carboxyl, formyl etc.) and that further distinctions, such as between 5 -methylation and 5 - hydroxyl -methylation, sho uld be made. It was noted that epigenetic changes may up -regulate some genes; down -regulate others; and have no effects on other genes. It was noted that it was currently unknown whether there is a threshold for adverse epigenetic effects. COM considered that it would be important to identify any impacts that epigenetics could have on standard genotoxicity studies. 2.16 Overall, it was considered that areas of epigenetics relevant to the remit of the COM include potential mechanisms for genetic damage and inh eritance. There was a need for validation of studies before epigenetics could be considered in risk assessment and chemical regulation. MUT/2016/06 Systematic review on the health effects of emissions to air from municipal waste incinerators 2.17 RESERVED MUT/2016/07 Quantitative approaches to the assessment of genotoxicity data. 2.18 COM were aware of work being conducted by a number of groups developing quantitative approaches to assessing genotoxic dose responses. The topic was addressed in a special issue of Mutagenesis published in June 2016 following an ILSI/HESI Genetic Toxicology Technical committee (GTTC) and European Environmental Mutagen Society /UKEMS workshop held in Lancaster in July 2014. The International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) working group on Quantitative Genetic Toxicology Risk Assessment (the QWG) had also published the outcome of its discussions and consensus views. 2.19 The COM considered a scoping paper outlining these current approaches and evaluated the potential for data, from in vivo genotoxicity studies, to be used in a margin of exposure (MoE) approach to risk assessment, similar to that utilised in the interpretation of carcinogenicity data. A presentation was given by Dr George Johnson from Swansea University who pre sented some of the work that had been undertaken by ILSI/HESI GTTC and IWGT groups on these quantitative approaches. The presentation covered the derivation of Points of departure (POD) using a variety of metrics; the No Observed Genotoxic Effect Level (N OGEL), the Breakpoint dose (BPD), the Slope transition Dose (STD) and Benchmark Dose (BMD); and how PODs could be used to determine human exposure levels expected to present a low or negligible risk to health. A number of case studies were considered, inc luding in vivo genotoxicity data sets for alkylating agents and benzo(a)pyrene. Consensus was reached by the study group that use of the BMD was the preferred option. It was noted that there are currently two different software packages used which differ somewhat in their approaches. The US Environmental Protection Annual Report 2016 38 Agency (EPA) BMD uses the best transformation of the response data for analyses, whereas the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) PROAST model uses the def ault assumption of a log -normal distribution. Furthermore, the Benchmark Dose Response (BMR) uses an increase relative to a negative control either by one standard deviation (US EPA) or a percentage (e.g. 5 or 10%) increased response (RIVM PROAST). 2.20 The CO M agreed that there had been a change in the quality of available in vivo genotoxicity data (e.g. more endpoints, tissues and dose groups) and significant developments in dose response modelling that allow in vivo genotoxicity data to be analysed quantitat ively rather than only qualitatively, but that the analysis needed be conducted on good quality and consistent data to be informative. Aspects that needed to be considered in terms of risk assessment included what test systems and endpoints were the most s uitable (e.g. gene mutations or micronuclei), what tissues should be analysed, what critical effect size should be used (e.g. BMDL 05 or BMDL 10), and what BMR values were needed for each genotoxicity endpoint. It was also agreed that if quantitative dose -response analysis of in vivo genotoxicity is developed and becomes accepted as an approach to estimate human cancer health risks, then there must be confidence that the approach is sufficiently precautionary and protective of health. It was anticipated that quantitative approaches to genotoxicity data should be considered further by the COM at future meetings. Horizon scanning 2.21 The COM undertakes an annual 'Horizon Scanning' exercise, which provides an opportunity for Members and assessors from Government Departments/Agencies to discuss and suggest topics for further work. OECD Genotoxicty test guidelines update . 2.22 The Committee continue to be updated and comment on, the review of old test guidelines (TGs) and the development of new TG's. 2.23 The Committee also commented on the Guidance Document on Revisions to OECD Genetic Toxicology Test Guidelines.

The membership of the Committee, agendas and minutes of meetings, and statements are all published on the internet (https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/committee -on- carcinogenicity -of-chemicals -in-food-consumer -products -and-the- environment held three meetings in 2016. A number of key issues are being studied, including for example the risks associated with new heat -not-burn tobacco products. COC is keen to promote public awareness and understanding, and so will introduce summaries written in non -technical languag e for its outputs wherever possible. In doing so we hope this will better communicate the wo rk that is being carried out, and emphasise the need for opinion and recommendations to be practical, based on an overview of the best available evidence. There was also continued preparation of a series of papers to provide guidance on how the potential cancer -causing chemicals (carcinogens) are investigated and reported. In 2016 two parts of a statement on alternatives to a two year animal study for detecting carcinogens was published. Further work will follow on this in 2017 . These statements are impor tant to ensure there is a consistent framework within which to best provide advice about new and existing potential threats. I assumed the role of Chair from Professor David Phillips during 2016. I wish to extend my gratitude to him, to all the Members of the Committee with whom I have worked this year, to the expertise of the Secretariat, and to the Imperial College London Toxicology Unit for its ongoing invaluable support. I also wish to extend special thanks to Ms Frances Pollitt who retired a s PHE Scientific Secretary at the end of April 2016. Professor David Harrison BSc MB ChB MD DSc FRCPath FRCPEd FRCSEd Annual Report 2016 43 COC Evaluations Alcohol and Cancer risk 3.1 In January 2016, the COC statement on consumption of alcoholic beverages and risk of cancer (CC/2015/S2), which was finalised and reported in the 2015 Annual Report, was published alongside the consultation on the CMOs' new alcohol guidelines. 3.2 The work by the Committee supported the conclusions drawn by the CMOs Guidelines Development Group, and messaging around potential carcinogenicity of alcohol was a significant element of the new Guidelines. Professor Phillips as Chair of COC supported the publication process and attended the Stakeholder briefing on the new guidelines. 3.3 The Committee prepared and submitted a response to the CMOs' consultation on the new guidelines in March 2016, and the Government response and final guidelines were published in August 2 016. Developments in the Mode of Action and Human Relevance Framework 3.4 The COC had last considered the Mode of Action and Human Relevance Framework in 2008, though an update had been given at 2013 horizon scanning discussion. 3.5 There was recognition that the concepts of key events and adverse outcomes are well accepted, but that dose response information is required to distinguish between adaptive responses and adverse outcomes. It was agreed that updates will be made in the guidance statement series where the framework is mentioned to reflect these considerations and to ensure up to date references are provided. 3.6 The Committee noted an interest in the Halifax project cited in this paper, organised by Getting to Know Cancer, and in particular the suggestion that the low levels of exposure to multiple chemicals which individually are not carcinogenic, may cause cancer. This would be considered, along with other recent developments on mixture assessments e.g. from EFSA, as part of the continuing review of the g uidance statement series in particular for the mixtures statement and the overarching statement. Frailty and Cancer 3.7 Cancer genetics and the influence of industrial exposure on cancer incidence had been raised as a horizon scanning topic in 2015 with refe rence to a particular Annual Report 2016 44 paper. This was part of a commentary series of papers on frailty and cancer, where frailty is defined as the variation in risk due to factors that cannot be measured in individuals and includes inherited differences, environmental influences from conception and through life, and random somatic genetic or epigenetic events. A review of the topic, commentary papers and the review authors' response were discussed by the Committee. 3.8 The Committee noted the use of uncertainty factors as a m eans of addressing known unknowns is well established, but the concept of frailty was interesting from a mechanistic perspective especially considering the mixture of exposures experienced and the diseases acquired through life. It was noted that frailty a lso covers individual differences in response, whereas uncertainty factors are applied on a population basis. The large variation in individual susceptibility was not always appropriately covered but raised questions about using this kind of information to adopt a more personalised approach, though it was acknowledged that there were a large number of environmental factors, diet and affluence which all affect cancer risk. The link with epigenetics, both in terms of signatures for potential susceptibility an d the influence of environmental factors on the epigenome, was noted and frailty could be borne in mind for the joint meeting on epigenetics. Incinerators 3.9 At the November 2016 meeting, the COC reviewed some unpublished research on health effects around m unicipal waste incinerators. The COC was asked to comment on the new evidence since its last assessment in 2011. This work is part of a wider research project which had previously been reviewed by COM in October 2016, and will be reviewed by COT in 2017. Once this research is published, each of the Committees' reviews will be made available. Horizon scanning 3.10 The COC undertakes horizon scanning exercises at regular intervals with the aim of identifying new and emerging issues which have potential to impa ct on public health. 3.11 In 2016 the Committee discussed the list from the previous year and noted progress on some activities during the year. The list of priority topics in no specific order following this discussion were: Annual Report 2016 45 Applicability of Margins of Exposure for exposure of young children Mechanisms incorporating genomics and the Cancer Genome Atlas Epigenetics In vitro systems - to be undertaken when resource allows Immunological and stromal cell modulations relevant to cancer risk Nanomaterials E-cigarettes and novel tobacco products, and effect of early life exposure to cigarettes 3.12 The Committee requested a standing agenda item for future meetings on horizon scanning topics and to update the COC on upcoming topics for IARC and the EU Scientific Com mittees. Ongoing work IGF-I 3.13 Insulin -like Growth Factor 1 (IGF -1) is a growth factor which has a variety of biological effects including the promotion of cell division and growth. It had been proposed that exposure to dietary IGF -1 could increase the risk of certain cancers, and the COC is evaluating the evidence on this. 3.14 The COC is considering an extensive range of data which covers dietary absorption, levels of IGF -1 in food and the association between blood levels of IGF-1 and the risk of certain types of cancer. Further data on IGF -I and lung and colorectal cancers were considered. The review of the relevant literature has been completed and a statement is under preparation. Guidance statements 3.15 The Committee continued to develop the guidance statemen t series during 2016. In February, two parts of the guidance statement G07 - Alternatives to the 2 -year Bioassay were published. These addressed alternative in vivo assays, i.e. animal studies, for the 2 year carcinogenicity study, and cell transformation assays, which cited the COM guidance on this. 3.16 Two further parts of the guidance statement on alternatives to the 2 -year bioassay were discussed addressing alternative testing strategies for carcinogenicity, which included a presentation on work by the OECD on developing an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA) for non -genotoxic carcinogens, and emerging technologies. It is likely that these wi ll be published in 2017. Further work during the year included discussion of assessing less than lifetime exposures to carcinogens, and an overview of the progress on the series as a whole.

Annual Report 2016 53 ANNEX 2 - Code of Conduct fo r members of the COC/COM/COT Public service values Members of the COC/COM/COT (hereafter referred to as \"the Committee\") must at all times: observe the highest standards of impartiality , integrity and objectivity in relation to the advice they provide and to the management of their Committee; be accountable , through the Chair of the Food Standards Agency and the Chief Medical Officers, to Ministers, Parliament and the public for its activities and for the standard of advice it provides; in accordanc e with Government policy on openness , fully comply with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 The Ministers of the sponsoring departments are answerable to Parliament for the policies and performance of the Committee, including the policy framework within which it operates. Standards in Public Life Members are expected to: comply with this Code, and ensure they understand their duties, rights and responsibilities, and that they are familiar with the function and role of their Committee and any relevant statements of Government policy. If necessary members should consider undertaking relevant training to assist them in carrying out their role; not misuse information gained in the course of their public service for personal gain or for political purpose, nor seek to use the opportunity of public service to promote their private interests or those of connected persons, firms, businesses or other organisations; and not hold any paid or high profile unpaid posts in a political party, and not engage in spec ific political activities on matters directly affecting the work of the Committee. When engaging in other political activities, Committee members should be conscious of their public role and exercise proper discretion. These restrictions do not apply to MP s (in those cases where MPs are eligible to be appointed), to local councillors, or to Peers in relation to their conduct in the House of Lords. follow the Seven Principles of Public Life set out by the Committee on Standards in Public Life (http://www.public -standards.gov.uk/ ). Selflessness Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. Annual Report 2016 54 Integrity Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performan ce of their official duties. Objectivity In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit. Accountabili ty Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office. Openness Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands. Honesty Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to the ir public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interests. Leadership Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example. These principles apply to all asp ects of public life. The Committee has set them out here for the benefit of all who serve the public in any way. Role of Members Members have collective responsibility for the operation of their Committee. Members are appointed as individuals to fulfil t he role of their respective Committees, not as representatives of their particular profession, employer or interest group and have a duty to act in the public interest. Members are appointed on a personal basis, even when they are members of stakeholder gr oups and organisations. If a member declares an organisation's view rather than a personal view they should make it clear at the time of declaring that view. Members must: Annual Report 2016 55 engage fully in collective consideration of the issues, taking account of the fu ll range of relevant factors, including any guidance issued by the Food Standards Agency, Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health undertake on appointment to comply with the Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees not divulge any commercially sensitive information, pre -publication or unpublished research data provided to the Committee agree an annual report ensure that an appropriate response is provided to complaints and other correspondence, if necessary with ref erence to the sponsor department; and; ensure that the Committee(s) does not exceed its powers or functions. A member's role on the Committee should not be limited by the expertise or viewpoint she or he was asked to bring to it. Any statement/report belongs to the whole Committee. Members should regard themselves free to question and comment on the information provided or the views expressed by any of the other members, even though the views or information provided do not relate to their own area of e xpertise. If members believe the committee's method of working is not rigorous or thorough enough, they have the right to ask that any remaining concerns they have be put on the record. Individual members should inform the Chair (or the Secretariat on his or her behalf) if they are invited to speak in public in their capacity as a Committee member. Communications between members and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board, CMOs and/or Ministers will generally be through the Chair except where the Chair has a greed that an individual member should act on its behalf. Nevertheless, any member has the right of access to the FSA Board and/or the CMO on any matter that he or she believes raises important issues relating to his or her duties as a Committee member. In such cases the agreement of the rest of the Committee should normally be sought. Committee appointments can be terminated early by either party, by giving 3 months notice, in writing. Should the Committee be disbanded before the end of the period of appo intment, appointments will terminate on dissolution. In the event that a member is found guilty of grave misconduct their appointment will be terminated immediately, in the case of the COT by the Chair of the FSA. The Department of Health has delegated t he powers for appointments to the COC and COM to the NHS Appointments Commission and it will terminate appointments in consultation with the PHE/DH. Role of the Chair The Chair has particular responsibility for providing effective leadership on the issu es above. In addition, the Chair is responsible for: ensuring that the Committee meets at appropriate intervals, ensuring that the minutes of meetings accurately reflect proceedings and any reports to the FSA Board and/or Ministers accurately record t he decisions taken ensuring that where appropriate, the views of individual members have been recorded; Annual Report 2016 56 representing the views of the Committee to the general public; ensuring that new members are briefed on appointment (and their training needs considered), and providing an assessment of their performance, on an annual basis or when members are considered for re -appointment to the Committee or for appointment to the board of some other public body. providing urgent advice to the FSA and HPA on issues within the remit of the Committee, in liaison with the Secretariat, Role of the Deputy Chair The Deputy Chair will assume the role of the Chair as described above if the Chair is not available. Role of the Secretariat The primary function of the Secretariat is to facilitate the business of the Committee. This includes supporting the Committee by arranging its meetings, assembling and analysing information, and recording conclusions. An important task is ensuring that proceedings of the Committee are properly documented and recorded. Minutes of all Committee meetings will be taken. These will accurately reflect the proceedings and discussions that take place and will be recorded on a non -attributable basis except where the views of one or more individual members need recording (for example, when declaring an interest). The Secretariat is also a source of advice and guidance to members on procedures and processes. The Secretariat is drawn from staff of the Food Standards Agency and Public Health Eng land. However, it is the responsibility of the Secretariat to be an impartial and disinterested reporter and at all times to respect the Committee's independent role. The Secretariat is required to guard against introducing bias during the preparation of p apers, during meetings, or in the reporting of the Committee's deliberations. Current contact details for each of the Secretariats are shown on the back page of this report. Role of the Assessor Meetings of the Committee (and working groups) may be attended by Assessors. The Assessors are nominated by, and drawn from, the Agencies and Departments that sponsor the Committee, receive its advice, or have other relevant policy interests. Assessors are not members of the Committee and do not participate in Committee business in the manner of members. The role of an Assessor is to keep their parent Department or Agency informed about the Committee's work and act as a conduit for the exchange of informa tion. They do this by: advising the Committee on relevant policy developments and the implications of Committee proposals; informing the Committee work through the provision of information being informed by the Committee on matters of mutual interest . sharing with the Secretariat the responsibility of ensuring that information is not needlessly withheld from the Committee. Assessors should make the Committee aware of the existence of any information that has been withheld from the Committee on the b asis Annual Report 2016 57 that it is exempt from disclosure under Freedom of Information legislation unless that legislation provides a basis for not doing so. ensuring that their parent Department or Agency is promptly informed of any matters which may require a response fr om Government. Role of other Officials, Invited Experts and Contractors Officials from Government Departments (not departmental assessors), Regulatory Agencies and Devolved Administrations may be called upon to advise the Committee on relevant developmen ts in order to help the Committee formulate its advice. Invited experts and contractors may also bring particular technical expertise, which may be requested by the Committee on some occasions. In the event of an official, invited expert or contractor not being able to attend written submissions may be sent via the Secretariat. Role of Observers Members of the public and other interested parties may attend meetings as observers. However, they should not attempt to participate in Committee discussions. If an interested party wishes to provide information relevant to a topic for consideration by the Committee, they should be submitted in writing to the Secretariat at least seven(7) working days before the meeting. The Secretariat will discuss with the Cha ir the most appropriate way to present the information to the committee and the Chair's decision will be final. Observers who have submitted information in advance of the meeting may be invited to provide further explanation or to make brief comments at th e discretion of the Chair. Observers and/or organisations must not interfere in the work of the Secretariat or input from invited experts, contractors, officials from Government Departments and Agencies in any way which, in the view of the Chair, constitut es harassment and/or might hinder the work of the Committee. Observers and/or organisations must allow other observers and other interested parties to attend items free from interference before, during and after a meeting. Observers and/or organisations a re required to respect the work of the Committee. The Committee's discussions represent the development of its view and any comments made in developing the agreed Committee view should not be attributed to individuals. Where a subject will be considered ov er several meetings, observers are asked to maintain the confidentiality of the discussion until an agreed Committee opinion is finalised. The Committee's conclusions are not finalised until completion of any necessary consultation and publication of a sta tement or report. Under no circumstances will Observers be permitted to record Committee proceedings, on the basis that this might inhibit free discussion. The published minutes of the meeting would provide a record of the proceedings. Failure to observ e this code of conduct may lead to exclusion of individual observers and/or organisations from meetings of the Committee. All observers and/or organisations are requested to read follow the Committees Openness policy (Annex 3) Annual Report 2016 58 Declaration of Members' Interests Definitions In this Code, 'the industry' means: Companies, partnerships or individuals who are involved with the production, manufacture, sale or supply of products subject to the following legislation; General Food Regulations 2004 The Food Safety Act 1990 (Amendment) Regulations 2004 The Medicines Acts 1968 and 1971, 1981, 1986 & 2003 The Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 The Consumer Protection Act 1987 The Cosmetic (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (EC1970/2006) Trade associations representing companies involved with such products; Companies, partnerships or individuals who are directly concerned with research, development or marketing of a product whic h is being considered by the Committees on Toxicity, Mutagenicity, or Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. 'the Secretariat' means the Secretariat of the COC, COM and COT; 'the Agency' means either the Food Stand ards Agency or the Health Protection Agency; and references to \"member(s)\" includes the Chair. Different types of Interest The following is intended as a guide to the kinds of interests which should be declared. Where members are uncertain as to whethe r an interest should be declared, they should seek guidance from the Secretariat or, where it may concern a particular product which is to be considered at a meeting, from the Chair at that meeting. If members have interests not specified in these notes but which they believe could be regarded as influencing their advice they should declare them. However, neither the members nor the Secretariat are under any obligation to search out links of which they might reasonably not be aware. This Code suggests th at interests of close family members are declared, members have in the past limited such declarations to personal partners, parents, children (minor and adult), brothers, sisters and the personal partners of any of these with the emphasis on disclosure onl y where the interest may, or may be perceived (by a reasonable member of the public) to influence a members' judgement. The Secretariat is required to publish an up -to-date register of members' interests and these can be found on the relevant Committees website. Personal Interests A personal interest involves the member personally. The main examples are: Annual Report 2016 59 Consultancies and/or direct employment: any consultancy, directorship, position in or work for industry which attracts regular or occasional payments in cash or kind; Fee-Paid Work: any work commissioned by industry for which the member is paid in cash or kind; Shareholdings: any shareholding in or other beneficial interest in shares of industry. This does not include shareholdings through unit tru sts or similar arrangements where the member has no influence on financial management; Membership or Affiliation: any membership role or affiliation that you or a close family member has to clubs or organisations with an interest or involvement in the wo rk of the Agency. Non-Personal Interests A non -personal interest involves payment which benefits the organisation in which the member works, but is not received by the member personally. The main examples are: Fellowships: the holding of a fellowship endowed by industry; Support by Industry: any payment, other support or sponsorship which does not convey any pecuniary or material benefit to a member personally, but which does benefit their position or organisation, e.g. i) a grant for the running of a unit or department for which the member is responsible; ii) a grant or fellowship or other payment to sponsor a post or a member of staff or a post graduate research programme for which the member is responsible. This does not include financial assistan ce for students; iii) the commissioning of research or other work by, or advice from, staff who work in a unit for which the member is responsible. Members are under no obligation to seek out knowledge of work done for, or on behalf of, the industry or o ther relevant bodies by departments in which they work, if they would not normally expect to be informed. Trusteeships : where a member is a trustee of a charity with investments in industry, the Secretariat can agree with the member a general declaration to cover this interest rather than draw up a detailed portfolio. At meetings members are required to declare relevant interests and to state whether they are personal or non -personal interests and whether they are specific or nonspecific to the matter, pr oduct or substance under consideration. Specific Interests A member must declare a personal specific interest if they have at any time worked on a matter, product or substance under consideration and have personally received payment for that work, in any form. A member must declare a non-personal specific interest if they are aware that the organisation in which they work has at any time worked on the matter, product or substance under consideration but they have not personally received payment for that work, in any form. Non-specific Interests Annual Report 2016 60 A member must declare a personal non -specific interest if they have a current personal interest in a company concerned with a matter, product or substance under consideration, which does not relate specifically to the matter, product or substance under discussion. A member must declare a non-personal non -specific interest if they are aware that the organisation in which they work is currently receiving payment from the company concerned which does not relate specif ically to the matter, product or substance under discussion. If a member is aware that a substance, product or matter under consideration is or may become a competitor of a substance, product or matter manufactured, sold or supplied by a company in which the member has a current personal interest, they should declare their interest in the company marketing the rival product, substance or matter. Handling conflicts of interests The purpose of these provisions is to avoid any danger of Committee members be ing influenced, or appearing to be influenced, by their private interests in the exercise of their public duties. All members should declare any personal or business interest which may, or may be perceived (by a reasonable member of the public) to, influen ce their judgement. A guide to the types of interest that should be declared is mentioned above. (i) Declaration of Interests to the Secretariat Members are required to inform the Agency in writing prior to appoint of their current personal and non -perso nal interests, including the principal position(s) held. Members are not required to disclose the amount of any salary, fee, shareholding, grant etc. An interest is current if the member has an on -going financial involvement e.g. if he or she holds shares in industry, has a consultancy contract, or if they or the organisation for which they are responsible is in the process of carrying out work for the industry. Following appointment members are asked to inform the Secretariat at the time of any change in their personal interests. However, the Secretariat will contact each member on an annual basis to update their declaration of interests. Changes in non-personal interests can be reported annually, and those involving less than \u00a31000 from a particular comp any in the previous year need not be declared. The register of interests is kept up -to-date and open to the public via the website. (ii) Declaration of Interest at Meetings Members of the Committee are required to verbally declare any direct interests re lating to salaried employment or consultancies, or those of close family 8 members in matters under discussion at each meeting, and if items are taken by correspondence between meetings. The declaration should note whether the interest is personal or nonpersonal , whether it is specific to the item under discussion, or non-specific and whether it is current or lapsed. Having fully explained the nature of their interest the Chair will, decide whether and to what extent the member should participate in th e discussion and determination of the issue and it should be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Withdrawal from meetings Annual Report 2016 61 If a declaration of interest has been made and the Committee decides that the member should not participate in the discussion and should withdraw from the meeting (even if held in public) and it should be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. The Chair may first allow them to make a statement on the item under discussion. Personal liability of Committee members The Department of Health has a formal statement of indemnity for its advisory committee members, which includes the COC and COM, its guidance is taken from the Cabinet Office \"Model Code of Practice for Board Members of Advisory Non -Departmental Public Bodies\" and states t hat \"Legal proceedings by a third party against individual board members of advisory bodies are very exceptional. A board member may be personally liable if he or she makes a fraudulent or negligent statement which result in a loss to a third party; or may commit a breach of confidence under common law or criminal offence under insider dealing legislation, if he or she misuses information gained through their position. However, the Government has indicated that individual board members who have acted honest ly, reasonably, in good faith and without negligence will not have to meet out of their own personal resources any personal civil liability which is incurred in execution or purported execution of their board functions. Board members who need further advic e should consult the sponsor department.\" 9 except where the person has acted recklessly. The FSA has also drawn up a formal statement of indemnity for its advisory committee members. INDEMNITY BY THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS IN FOOD, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Food Standards Agency hereby undertakes with the members (including the Chair) of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in food, Consumer products and the environment (COT) to indemnif y them against all liability in respect of any action or claim which may be brought, or threatened to be brought, against them either individually or collectively by reason of or in connection with the performance of their duties as members, including all costs, charges and expenses which the Members may properly and reasonably suffer or incur in disputing any such action or claim. The Members shall as soon as practicable notify the Food Standards Agency if any action or claim is brought or threatened to b e brought against them in respect of which indemnity may be sought and if an action or claim is brought, the Food Standards Agency shall be entitled to take conduct of the defence, dispute, compromise or appeal of the action or claim and of any incidental negotiations relating to the action or claim. The Food Standards Agency shall notify the Members as soon as practicable if it intends to so take conduct and the Members shall then provide to the Food Standards Agency such information and assistance as it shall reasonably request, subject to all out of pocket expenses properly and reasonably incurred by them being reasonably reimbursed. The Food Standards Agency shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, consult with and keep the Members informed as a nd when reasonably requested by the Members in respect of any action or claim. If the Food Standards Agency does not so take conduct the Annual Report 2016 62 Members shall keep the Food Standards Agency fully informed of the progress of the action or claim and any consequent l egal proceedings and consult with the Food Standards Agency as and when required by the Food Standards Agency concerning the action or claim. The indemnity shall not extend to any losses, claims, damages, costs, charges, expenses and any other liabilities : (a) in respect of which the Members are indemnified by or through any defence organisation or insurers or; (b) which may result from bad faith (including dishonesty), wilful default or recklessness on the part of the Members; or (c) which may result from any of the following circumstances: (i) any settlement made or compromise effected without the knowledge or consent of the Food Standards Agency on behalf of the Members of any action or claim brought, or threatened to be brought, against the Members; or (ii) any admission by the Members of any liability or responsibility in respect of any action or claim brought, or threatened to be brought, against them; or (iii) Members taking action that they were aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, might pr ejudice the successful defence of any action or claim, once the Members had become aware that such an action or claim had been brought or was likely to be brought. Annual Report 2016 63 ANNEX 3 - Openness Introduction 1. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) and its sister committees the Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) are non -statutory independent scientific advisory committees which advise the Chair of the Food Standards Agency and the Chief Medical Officers (for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and, through them, the Government on a wide range of matters concerning chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment. 2. The Government is committed to make the operation of scientific advisory committees such as the COT/COM/COC hereafter referred to as \"the Committee\" more open and to increase accountability. The Committee is aware that the disclosure of information that is of a confidential nature and is communi cated in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence is subject to the common law of confidentiality. There are some circumstances making disclosure of confidential information lawful for example, where the individual to whom the information relate s has consented; where disclosure is in the public interest; and where there is a legal duty to do so. However, guidance is set out in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 11 which gives any person legal rights of access to information which is held by a pub lic authority. 3. The Committee has agreed to hold open meetings as standard practice. Interest groups, consumer organisations etc can attend (subject to the appropriate procedures for handling commercially sensitive information and research not in the pu blic domain, paragraphs 9 -15 refer). 4. The Committee appoints lay/public interest member(s) to help to increase public scrutiny of Committee business. 5. The Committee has agreed to the publication of agendas, draft and finalised minutes, discussion pap ers and statements on the internet. 6. Statements will summarise all the relevant data, such as information regarding potential hazards/risks for human health in respect of the use of products and chemicals, and any recommendations for further research. 7. The Committee will be asked for an opinion based on the data available at the time of consideration. It is recognised that, for many chemicals, the toxicological information is incomplete and that recommendations for further research to address these ga ps may form part of the Committee's advice 8. The release of documents (papers, minutes and statements) where the Committee has agreed an opinion on the available unpublished data but where further additional information is required in order to finalise t he Committee's conclusions, needs to be considered on a case -by case basis. The relevant considerations include the likelihood that such additional data would alter the Committee's conclusion, any representations made by a company about, for example, comme rcial harm that early disclosure could cause and also the public interest in disclosure. Annual Report 2016 64 Procedures for handling commercially sensitive information and research data not in the public domain Background 9. The Committee operates on a presumption of openness. However, it is recognised that the nature of the work will at times provide the Committee access to information that is not in the public domain. Decisions on confidentiality will be exercised consistently with consideration to the Freedom of Inf ormation Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004. 10. Where there is a need to discuss matters that cannot be put in the public domain the Committee may hold a discussion in \"Reserved Business\". These items will be generally discussed eith er at the beginning or the end of an open meeting. It is expected that such cases will be infrequent and only in clearly justified circumstances. For the most part this comprises information which is commercially sensitive such as product formulations/spec ifications, methods of manufacture, and reports of toxicological investigations and company evaluations and safety assessment. It would also include pre - publication or unpublished research data. 11. \"Reserved Business\" items will be clearly indicated as s uch. The Committee will advise its reasons for withholding any information, and, if possible, an indication of when and where the information withheld may be published. Information subject to such restriction, including reserved sections of the minutes wil l be placed in the public domain as soon as practicable should the restrictions cease to apply at a later date. 12. Normal procedure is to publish a summary of the Committee's advice on their respective websites, in the Annual Report and where necessary to ask companies to release full copies of submitted reports for retention by the British Library at the completion of a review. Given the clear Ministerial commitment to the publication of detailed information regarding the activities of advisory committe es, and in particular following the assessment of products which are already available to the general public, the Committee will publish statements via the Internet soon after they have been finalised. 13. Except in cases where there is legislation under which information has been submitted and which deals with disclosure and non -disclosure, the general principle of the common law duty of confidentiality will apply. This means that any information which is commercially sensitive, pre -publication or unpubli shed research data and has been obtained in circumstances importing a duty of confidence may not be disclosed unless consent has been given or there is an overriding public interest in disclosure (such as the prevention of harm to others). 14. The following procedure will be adopted which allows commercially sensitive information to be identified, assessed and appropriate statements to be drafted and published on the basis of a prior mutual understanding with the companies. There is scope for compan ies to make representations also after submission of the information and prior to publication regarding the commercial sensitivity of data supplied and to comment on the text of statements which are to be published. However, companies would not have a righ t of veto in respect of such statements. Annual Report 2016 65 Procedures prior to committee consideration Initial discussions 15. Upon referral to Committee the Secretariat will liaise with the relevant company supplying the product in the UK to: i) clearly state the policy of Committee openness (summarised above) ii) identify and request the information needed by the Committee (e.g. test reports, publications etc). Commercially sensitive information iii) The company will be asked to clearly identify any commercially sensit ive information and the reason for confidentiality. Pre-publication and unpublished research data iv) The Committee and Secretariat will respect the confidentiality of authors of (unpublished or pre -publication) research data. Handling confidential data v) The procedures by which the Committee will handle commercially sensitive information, pre-publication or unpublished research data and the public availability of papers, minutes, conclusions and statements where reference is made to such data will be discussed with the company or author prior to submission of papers to the Committee and is outlined in paragraphs 9 -15 above. Companies will be informed that confidential annexes to Committee papers (e.g. where detailed information supplied in confidence s uch as individual patient information and full study reports of toxicological studies) will not be disclosed but that other information will be disclosed unless agreed otherwise with an individual company. vi) The following is a suggested list of informat ion which may be disclosed in Committee documents (papers, minutes and statements). The list is not exhaustive and is presented as a guide: a) name of product (or substance/chemical under consideration), b) information on physico -chemical properties, c) me thods of rendering harmless, d) a summary of the results and evaluation of the results of tests to establish harmlessness to humans, e) methods of analysis, f) first aid and medical treatment to be given in the case of injury to persons, g) surveillance data (e.g. monitoring for levels in food, air, or water). Procedures during and after Committee consideration vii) The timing of release of Committee documents (papers, minutes and statements) where the item of business involved the consideration of con fidential data would be Annual Report 2016 66 subject to the general provisions outlined in paragraphs 9 -15 above. Documents would not be released until the Committee statement is available. viii) The most important outcome of the Committee consideration is likely to be the ag reed statement. Companies will be given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to publication and to make representations (for example, as to commercial sensitivities in the statement). The Chair would be asked to consider any comments provided, but companies would not be able to veto the publication of a statement or any part of it. Companies will continue to be asked to release full copies of submitted reports for retention by the British Library at the completion of a review. Dissenting views 16. The Committee should not seek consensus at the risk of failing to recognise different views on a subject. Any significant diversity of opinion among the members of the Committee that cannot be resolved should be accurately reflected in the minutes or report. Committee decisions should always include an explanation of where differences of opinion have arisen during discussions, specifically where there are unresolved issues and why conclusions have been reached. If however member(s) feel they cannot sup port the Committee conclusions they may declare a 'minority report' identifying which member(s) are making the minority report and setting out their position. COC/COM/COT papers 17. Committee papers are available on the respective website. Papers will no t include commercially sensitive documents, pre -publication, unpublished or material in the public domain. Where possible a cover page with weblinks (current at the time) will be provided. Remuneration and Committee finance 18. In the financial year 2015 /16 the budget for the COT, excluding Secretariat resources was \u00a337,000 . Costs were met by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). 19. Committee members may claim a fee for Committee meetings: COC and COM Committee Chair \u00a3198 per day COC and COM Committee Membe r \u00a3153 per day COT Committee Chair \u00a3205 per day COT Committee Member \u00a3160 per day Where COT members are unable to attend a meeting but contribute in writing, a \u00a350.00 reading fee is paid. Review of fee rates 20. Fees in respect of the COT are set by the FSA and for COC and COM by the Department of Health . The FSA will review and revise COT rates every 2 years with the intention that rates should rise in line with the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Board with regard to pay in the Senior Civil Service. The FSA will also take into account comparisons with rates paid in similar advisory bodies in the UK. Annual Report 2016 67 Travel and other expenses 21. Committee members are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable travel and subsistence expenses necessarily incurred on official committee business. Members must seek value for money and are encouraged to use the most cost effective and environmentally sustainable options for travel and accommodation. Working Groups 22. The Committee may establish Working Groups to consider particular topics in depth or to make brief assessments of particular issues and advise the main Committee on the possible need for further action. Such Groups contain a number of Committee members (supplemented, as necessary, by external expertise in the particular subject being considered). A Committee Chair will play a leading role in deciding which Committee members should be invited to join such groups, which may meet on a number of occasions i n a particular year. Committee members may claim an allowance for participating on a Working Group. Terms and conditions of appointment 23. Appointments of members may be staggered so that only a proportion retire or are re - appointed each year, to help e nsure continuity. (Note: The COC/COM/COT Chairs are ex officio members of General Advisory Committee on Science (GACS) for the term of their appointment as the COC/COM/COT Chair. COC and COM Chairs are ex officio members of each other's Committees.) 24. C OC and COM members are usually expected to attend 3 meetings in a year. COT members are expected to attend 7 meetings in a year. Members should allow appropriate preparation time. Meetings will usually be in London. 25. The COC/COM/COT Chair must also be available for a number of other activities including: attending, with the FSA Chief Scientist, the FSA Board's annual discussion of the Agency's science; engaging with the media on any high -profile relating to the Committee's work, and discussion with the Agency Chief Scientist and GACS Secretariat in planning and developing the Committee's work (including discussing and agreeing with the Agency's Chief Scientist a framework for providing assurance on the work of the Scientific Advisory Committees in provid ing advice to the Agency). It is expected that these additional activities might require 5 -10 days input per year. Feedback on performance 26. The COT Chair and members are asked to provide brief feedback on their experience on the committee each year to help the Agency ensure that the Committee operates effectively and identify any areas for improvement. 27. Committee members are normally appointed for a term of 3 years (a maximum 10 years/3 terms per member). The COT uses the feedback self assessment form as one of the tools used to determine whether or not a committee member should be reappointed at the end of their (3 year) term. Annual Report 2016 68 ANNEX 4 - Good Practice Agreement for Scientific Advisory Committees INTRODUCTION The Government Chief Scientific Adviser's Guidelines on the Use of Scientific and Engineering Advice in Policy Making set out the basic principles which government departments should follow in assembling and using scientific advice. The key elements are to: identify early the issues which need scientific and engineering advice and where public engagement is appropriate; draw on a wide range of expert advice sources, particularly when there is uncertainty; adopt an open and transparent approach to the scientific advisory process and publish the evidence and analysis as soon as possible; explain publicly the reasons for policy decisions , particularly when the decision appears to be inconsistent with scientific advice; and work collectively to ens ure a joined -up approach throughout government to integrating scientific and engineering evidence and advice into policy making. The Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees and the Principles of Scientific Advice to Government provide more de tailed guidance on the operation of scientific advisory committees (SACs) and their relationship with their sponsor Departments. The Food Standards Agency's Board adopted a Science Checklist in 2006 (updated in 2012) that makes explicit the points to be considered in the preparation of policy papers and proposals dealing with science -based issues, including those which draw on advice from the SACs. These Good Practice Guidelines were drawn up in 2006 by the Chairs of the independent SACs that advise th e FSA based on, and complementing, the Science Checklist. They were updated in 2012 in consultation with the General Advisory Committee on Science (GACS). The Guidelines apply to the SACs that advise the FSA and for which the FSA is sole or lead sponsor Department: Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs Advisory Committee on Microbiological Safety of Foods Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Science Council Social Science Research Committee Annual Report 2016 69 For the SACs with a shared sponsorship the Guidelines apply formally to their advice to the FSA; they may opt to follow them also in advising other sponsor Departments. All these committees share important characteristics. They: are independent; work in an open and transparent way; and are c oncerned with risk assessment and/or science governance, not with decisions about risk management. The Guidelines relate primarily to the risk assessment process since this is the main purpose of most of the SACs. However, the SACs may, where appropriat e, comment on risks associated with different risk management options, highlight any wider issues raised by their assessment that they feel should be considered (distinguishing clearly between issues on which the SAC has an expert capability and remit, and any other issues), or any evidence gaps and/or needs for research or analysis. In addition, GACS and SSRC may advise the FSA on aspects of the governance of risk management, or on research that relates to risk management. Twenty nine principles of good practice have been developed. However, the different committees have different duties and discharge those duties in different ways. Therefore, not all of the principles set out below will be applicable to all of the committees, all of the time. The SACs have agreed to review their application of the principles annually and report this in their Annual Reports. Compliance with the Guidelines will also be covered in the annual self assessments by Members and annual feedback meetings between each SA C Chair and the FSA Chief Scientist.Annual Report 2016 70 PRINCIPLES Defining the problem and the approach 1. The FSA will ensure that issues it asks an SAC to address are clearly defined and take account of stakeholder expectations in discussion with the SAC Secretariat and where necessary the SAC Chair. The SAC Chair will refer back to the FSA if discussion sug gests that further iteration and discussion of the task is necessary. Where an SAC proposes to initiate a piece of work the SAC Chair and Secretariat will discuss this with FSA to ensure the definition and rationale for the work and its expected use by th e FSA are clear. Seeking input 2. The Secretariat will ensure that stakeholders are consulted at appropriate points in the SAC's considerations. It will consider with the FSA whether and how stakeholder views need to be taken into account in helping to iden tify the issue and frame the question for the committee. 3. Wherever possible, SAC discussions should be held in public. 4. The scope of literature searches made on behalf of the SAC will be clearly set out. 5. Steps will be taken to ensure that all available and r elevant scientific evidence is rigorously considered by the committee, including consulting external/additional scientific experts who may know of relevant unpublished or pre -publication data. 6. Data from stakeholders will be considered and weighted accordin g to quality by the SAC. 7. Consideration by the Secretariat and the Chair (and where appropriate the whole SAC) will be given to whether expertise in other disciplines will be needed. 8. Consideration will be given by the Secretariat or by the SAC, in discussio n with the FSA, as to whether other SACs need to be consulted. Validation 9. Study design, methods of measurement and the way that analysis of data has been carried out will be assessed by the SAC. 10. Data will be assessed by the committee in accordance with th e relevant principles of good practice, e.g. qualitative social science data will be assessed with reference to guidance from the Government's Chief Social Researcher3. 11. Formal statistical analyses will be included wherever appropriate. To support this, each SAC will have access to advice on quantitative analysis and modelling as needed. 12. When considering what evidence needs to be collected for assessment, the following points will be considered: the potential for the need for different data for different parts of the UK or the relevance to the UK situation for any data originating outside the UK; and whether stakeholders can provide unpublished data. 3 Quality in Qualitative E valuation: A Framework for assessing research evidence http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp -content/uploads/2011/09/a_quality_framework_tcm6 -7314.pdf ; The Magenta book http://www.hm -treasury.gov.uk/d/magenta_book_combined.pdf Annual Report 2016 71 13. The list of references will make it clear whic h references have been subject to external peer review, and which have been peer reviewed through evaluation by the Committee, and if relevant, any that have not been peer reviewed. Uncertainty 14. When reporting outcomes, SACs will make explicit the level a nd type of uncertainty (both limitations on the quality of the available data and lack of knowledge) associated with their advice . 15. Any assumptions made by the SAC will be clearly spelled out, and, in reviews, previous assumptions will be challenged. 16. Data gaps will be identified and their impact on uncertainty assessed by the SAC. 17. An indication will be given by the SAC about whether the evidence base is changing or static, and if appropriate, how developments in the evidence base might affect key assu mptions and conclusions. Drawing conclusions 18. The SAC will be broad -minded, acknowledging where conflicting views exist and considering whether alternative interpretations fit the same evidence. 19. Where both risks and benefits have been considered, the comm ittee will address each with the same rigour, as far as possible; it will make clear the degree of rigour and uncertainty, and any important constraints, in reporting its conclusions. 20. SAC decisions will include an explanation of where differences of opinion have arisen during discussions, specifically where there are unresolved issues, and why conclusions have been reached. If it is not possible to reach a consensus, a minority report may be appended to the main report, setting out the differences in interpretation and conclusions, and the reasons for these, and the names of those supporting the minority report. 21. The SAC's interpretation of results, recommended actions or advice will be consistent with the quantitative and/or qualitative evidence and t he degree of uncertainty associated with it. 22. SACs will make recommendations about general issues that may have relevance for other committees . Communicating SACs' conclusions 23. Conclusions will be expressed by the SAC in clear, simple terms and use the minimum caveats consistent with accuracy. 24. It will be made clear by the SAC where assessments have been based on the work of other bodies and where the SAC has started afresh and there will be a clear statement of how the current conclusions compare with previ ous assessments. 25. The conclusions will be supported by a statement about their robustness and the extent to which judgement has had to be used. 26. As standard practice, the SAC secretariat will publish a full set of references (including the data used as the b asis for risk assessment and other SAC opinions) at as early a stage as possible to support openness and transparency of decision -making. Where this is not possible, reasons will be clearly set out, explained and a commitment made to future publication wh erever possible. Annual Report 2016 72 27. The amount of material withheld by the SAC or FSA as being confidential will be kept to a minimum. Where it is not possible to release material, the reasons will be clearly set out, explained and a commitment made to future publication wh erever possible. 28. Where proposals or papers being considered by the FSA Board rest on scientific evidence produced by a SAC, the Chair of the SAC (or a nominated expert member) will be invited to the table at the Open Board meetings at which the paper is discussed. To maintain appropriate separation of risk assessment and risk management processes, the role of the Chairs will be limited to providing an independent view and assurance on how their committee's advice has been reflected in the relevant policy proposals, and to answer Board Members' questions on the science. The Chairs may also, where appropriate, be invited to provide factual briefing to Board members about particular issues within their committees' remits, in advance of discussion at open Boa rd meetings. 29. The SAC will seek (and FSA will provide) timely feedback on actions taken (or not taken) in response to the SAC's advice, and the rationale for these. Annual Report 2016 73 Annex 5 - Glossary of Terms a priori : The formulation of a hypothesis before undertaking an investigation or experiment. Absorption (biological): Process of active or passive transport of a substance into an organism, in humans this is usually through the lungs, gastrointestinal tract or skin Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) : Estimate of the amount of a substance in food or drink, expressed on a bodyweight basis (e.g. mg/kg bodyweight), that can be ingested daily over a lifetime by humans without appreciable health risk. Acceptable Risk: Probability of suffering d isease or injury which is considered to be sufficiently small to be \"negligible\" Acute : Short term, in relation to exposure or effect. Acute reference dose (ARfD) : Estimate of the amount of a substance in food or drink, expressed on a body weight basis tha t can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without appreciable health risk. Acute toxicity : Adverse effects that occur over a short period of time (up to 14 days) immediately following exposure. Adduct : A chemical grouping which is covalently bound (see covalent binding) to a large molecule such as DNA (qv) or protein. Adenoma : A benign neoplasm arising from a gland forming epithelial tissue such as colon, stomach or respiratory tract. Adverse effect : Change in morphology, physiology, biochemistry, growth, development or lifespan of an organism which results in impairment of functional capacity or impairment of capacity to compensate for additional stress or increase in susceptibility to the harmful effects of other environmental influences. Aetiolog y: study of causation or origination Ah receptor : The Ah (Aromatic hydrocarbon) receptor protein regulates some specific gene expressions associated with toxicity. The identity of the natural endogenous chemicals which bind to the Ah receptor is unknown. B inding to the Ah receptor is an integral part of the toxicological mechanism of a range of chemicals, such as chlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. Alkylating agents : Chemicals which leave an alkyl group covalently bound to biologically important molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids (see adduct). Many alkylating agents are mutagenic, carcinogenic and immunosuppressive. Allele : Alternative form of a gene. Annual Report 2016 74 Allergen : Substance capable of stimulating an allergic reaction. Allergy : The adverse health effects that may result from the stimulation of a specific immune response. Allergic reaction : an adverse reaction elicited by exposure to a previously sensitised individual to the relevant antigen. Ames test : In vitro (qv) assay for bacte rial gene mutations (qv) using strains of Salmonella typhimurium developed by Ames and his colleagues. Androgen : The generic term for any natural or synthetic compound that can interact with and activate the androgen receptor. In mammals, androgens (for ex ample, androstenedione and testosterone) are synthesised by the adrenal glands and the testes and promote development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics. Aneugenic : Inducing aneuploidy (qv). Aneuploidy : The circumstances in which the total number of chromosomes within a cell is not an exact multiple of the normal haploid (see 'polyploidy') number. Chromosomes may be lost or gained during cell division. Apoptosis : A form of active cell death resulting in fragmentation of the cell into membrane -bound fragments (apoptotic bodies). These are usually rapidly removed in vivo by engulfment by phagocytic cells. Apoptosis can occur normally during development, but is often triggered by toxic stimuli. ARfD: see Acute reference dose Base pair (bp): Two complementary nucleotide (qv) bases joined together by chemical bonds. Benchmark dose (BMD) modelling : An approach to dose -response assessment that aims to be more quantitative than the NOAEL process. This approach constructs mathematical models to f it all data points in the dose -response study and uses the best fitting model to interpolate an estimate of the dose that corresponds to a particular level of response (a benchmark response), often 10%. A measure of uncertainty is also calculated, and the lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose is called the BMDL. The BMDL accounts for the uncertainty in the estimate of the dose -response that is due to characteristics of the experimental design such as sample size. The BMDL can be used as the point of departure for derivation of a health -based guidance value or a margin of exposure. Bias : In the context of epidemiological studies, an interference which at any stage of an investigation tends to produce results that depart systematically from the true val ues (to be distinguished from random error). The term does not necessarily carry an imputation of prejudice or any other subjective factor such as the experimenter's desire for a particular outcome. Annual Report 2016 75 Bioavailability : A term referring to the proportion of a substance which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged after a particular route of administration. Bioinformatics : The science of informatics as applied to biological research. Informatics is the management and analysis of data using advanced computing techniques. Bioinformatics is particularly important as an adjunct to genomics research, because of the large amount of complex data this research generates. Biomarker : Observable change (not necessarily pathological) in an organism, related to a specific exposure or effect. Body burden : Total amount of a chemical present in an organism at a given time. Bradford Hill Criteria : Sir Austin Bradford -Hill established criteria that may be used to assist in the interpretation of associations reported from epidem iological studies: - - Strength - The stronger the association the more likely it is causal. The COC has previously noted that the relative risks of <3 need careful assessment for effects of bias or confounding. - Consistency - The association has been cons istently identified by studies using different approaches and is also seen in different populations with exposure to the chemical under consideration. - Specificity - Limitation of the association to specific exposure groups or to specific types of disease increases likelihood that the association is causal. - Temporality - The association must demonstrate that exposure leads to disease. The relationship of time since first exposure, duration of exposure and time since last exposure are all important in ass essing causality. - Biological gradient - If an association reveals a biological gradient or doseresponse curve, then this evidence is of particular importance in assessing causality. - Plausibility - Is there appropriate data to suggest a mechanism by which exposure could lead to concern? However, even if an observed association may be new to science or medicine it should not be dismissed. - Coherence - Cause and effect interpretation of data should not seriously conflict with generally known facts. - Experiment - Can the association be demonstrated? Evidence from experimental animals may assist in some cases. Evidence that removal of the exposure leads to a decrease in risk may be relevant. - Analogy - Have other closely related chemicals been associate d with the disease? Annual Report 2016 76 Bronchial : Relating to the air passages conducting air from the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. C. elegans : Caenorhabditis elegans , a nematode or roundworm, the first animal to have its genome completely sequenced and all the genes ful ly characterised.

Candidate gene : A gene that has been implicated in causing or contributing to the development of a particular disease. Carcinogenesis : The origin, causation and development of tumours (qv). The term applies to benign as well as malignant neoplasms and not just to carcinomas (qv).

The test material is given throughout life to groups of animals at different dose levels. Carcinogen : The causal agents which induce tumours. They inclu de external factors (chemicals, physical agents, viruses) and internal factors such as hormones. Chemical carcinogens are structurally diverse and include naturally -occurring substances as well as synthetic compounds. An important distinction can be drawn between genotoxic (qv) carcinogens which have been shown to react with and mutate DNA, and nongenotoxic carcinogens which act through other mechanisms. The activity of genotoxic carcinogens can often be predicted from their chemical structure - either of t he parent compound or of active metabolites (qv). Most chemical carcinogens exert their effects after prolonged exposure, show a dose -response relationship and tend to act on a limited range of susceptible target tissues. Carcinogens are sometimes species or sex -specific and the term should be qualified by the appropriate descriptive adjectives to aid clarity. Several different chemical and other carcinogens may interact, and constitutional factors (genetic susceptibility, hormonal status) may also contribu te, emphasising the multifactorial nature of the carcinogenic process. Carcinoma : Malignant tumour arising from epithelial cells lining, for example, the alimentary, respiratory and urogenital tracts and from epidermis, also from solid viscera such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys and some endocrine glands.

Cell transformation : The process by which a normal cell acquires the capacity for neoplastic growth. Complete transformation occurs in several stages both in vitro and in vivo. One step which has been identified in vitro is 'immortalisation' by which a cell acquires the ability to divide indefinitely in culture. Such cells do not have the capacity to form tumours in animals, but can be induced to do so by extend ed passage in vitro , by treatment with chemicals, or by transfection with oncogene DNA. The transformed Annual Report 2016 77 phenotype so generated is usually, but not always, associated with the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar and to form tumours when transplanted i nto animals. It should be noted that each of these stages of transformation can involve multiple events which may or may not be genetic.

The rate at which th e disease develops in the cohort is compared with the rate in a comparison population, in which the characteristics (e.g. exposure) are absent. Complementary DNA (cDNA): cDNA is DNA that is synthesised in the laboratory from mRNA by reverse transcription. A cDNA is so -called because its sequence is the complement of the original mRNA sequence. Confounding variable: (synonym - confounder) An extraneous variable that satisfies BOTH of 2 conditions: (1) it is a risk factor for the disease under study (2) it is associated with the study exposure but is not a consequence of exposure. For example cigarette smoking is a confounding variable with respect to an association between alcohol consumption and heart disease. Failure to adjust for a confounding variable res ults in distortion of the apparent magnitude of the effect of the exposure under study.

Cytogenetic : Concerning chromosomes, their origin, structure and function. Deletion : A chromosomal aberration in which a proportion of the chromosome is lost. Deletions may range in size from a single nucleotide (qv) to an entire chromosome. Such deletions may be harmless, may result in disease, or may in rare cases be beneficial. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) : The car rier of genetic information for all living organisms except the group of RNA viruses. Each of the 46 chromosomes in normal human cells consists of 2 strands of DNA containing up to 100,000 nucleotides, specific sequences of which make up genes (qv).

Mouse lymphoma assay : An in vitro assay for gene mutation in m ammalian cells using a mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y, which is heterozygous for the gene (carries only one functional gene rather than a pair) for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK +/-). Mutation of that single gene is measured by resistance to toxic triflu orothymidine. Mutant cells produce two forms of colony - large, which represent mutations within the gene and small, which represent large genetic changes in the chromosome such as chromosome aberrations. Thus this assay can provide additional information about the type of mutation which has occurred if colony size is scored. Mouse spot test : An in vivo test for mutation, in which pregnant mice are dosed with the test compound and mutations are detected by changes (spots) in coat colour of the offspring.

Translation : In molecular biology, the process during which the information in mRNA molecules is used to construct proteins. Tumour (Synonym - neoplasm): A mass of abnormal, disorganised cells, arising from pre - existing tissue, which are cha racterised by excessive and uncoordinated proliferation and by abnormal differentiation. Benign tumours show a close morphological resemblance to their tissue of origin; grow in a slow expansile fashion; and form circumscribed and (usually) encapsulated ma sses. They may stop growing and they may regress. Benign tumours do not infiltrate through local tissues and they do not metastasise (qv). They are rarely fatal. Malignant tumours (synonym - cancer) resemble their parent tissues less closely and are compos ed of increasingly abnormal cells in terms of their form and function. Well differentiated examples still retain recognisable features of their tissue of origin but these characteristics are progressively lost in moderately and poorly differentiated malign ancies: undifferentiated or anaplastic tumours are composed of cells which resemble no known normal tissue. Most malignant tumours grow rapidly, spread progressively through adjacent tissues and metastasise to distant sites. Tumours are conventionally clas sified according to the anatomical site of the primary tumour and its Annual Report 2016 90 microscopical appearance, rather than by cause. Some common examples of nomenclature are as follows: - Tumours arising from epithelia (qv): carcinomas. - Tumours arising from connective tissues such fat, cartilage or bone: benign lymphoid tissues are malignant and are called lymphomas (qv); they are often multifocal. Malignant proliferations of bone marrow cells are called leukaemias. Benign tumours may evolve to the corresponding malignant tumours; examples in volve the adenoma carcinoma sequence in the large bowel in humans, and the papilloma carcinoma sequence in mouse skin. Tumour initiation : A term originally used to describe and explain observations made in laboratory models of multistage carcinogenesis, principally involving repeated applications of chemicals to the skin of mice. Initiation, in such contexts, was the first step whereby small numbers of cells were irreversibly changed, or initiated. Subsequent, separate events (see tumour p romotion) resulted in the development of tumours. It is now recognised that these early, irreversible heritable changes in initiated cells were due to genotoxic damage, usually in the form of somatic mutations and the initiators used in these experimental models can be regarded as genotoxic carcinogens (qv). Tumour promotion : An increasingly confusing term, originally used, like 'tumour initiation' to describe events in multistage carcinogenesis in experimental animals. In that context, promotion is regarde d as the protracted process whereby initiated cells undergo clonal expansion to form overt tumours. The mechanisms of clonal expansion are diverse, but include direct stimulation of cell proliferation, repeated cycles of cell damage and cell regeneration a nd release of cells from normal growth -controlling mechanisms. Initiating and promoting agents were originally regarded as separate categories, but the distinction between them is becoming increasingly hard to sustain. The various modes of promotion are no n-genotoxic, but it is incorrect to conclude that 'non -genotoxic carcinogen' (qv) and 'promoter' are synonymous. Uncertainty factor : Value used in extrapolation from experimental animals to man (assuming that man may be more sensitive) or from selected in dividuals to the general population: for example, a value applied to the NOAEL to derive an ADI or TDI. The value depends on the size and type of population to be protected and the quality of the toxicological information available. Unscheduled DNA Synthes is (UDS) : DNA synthesis that occurs at some stage in the cell cycle other than the S period (the normal or 'scheduled' DNA synthesis period), in response to DNA damage. It is usually associated with DNA repair. Annual Report 2016 91 Volume of distribution : Apparent volume of fl uid required to contain the total amount of a substance in the body at the same concentration as that present in the plasma, assuming equilibrium has been attained. WHO -TEQs : The system of Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) used in the UK and a number of oth er countries to express the concentrations of the less toxic dioxin -like compounds (16 PCDDs/PCDFs and 12 PCBs) as a concentration equivalent to the most toxic dioxin 2,3,7,8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin (TCDD) is that set by the World Health Organisation ( WHO), and the resulting overall concentrations are referred to as WHO - TEQs (Total toxic equivalents). Xenobiotic : A chemical foreign to the biologic system. Xenoestrogen : A 'foreign' compound with estrogenic activity (see estrogen).
