Ayurveda is known as a natural medicine, a practice for healthy living and the sister science to yoga. Working with concepts that connect us with the occurrences of nature, recognition is given to each person as an individual with their own experiences, imbalances and needs. It works to keep conditions at bay as a preventative form of self care by paying attention to day to day symptoms like anxiety, lack of sleep, skin conditions, indigestion and depression to name a few. While the application of this science will differ from person to person, practices can range from modifying routine, choosing nourishing foods based on their digestive effect, using herbal therapies, receiving bodywork and practicing yoga and meditation. Though its origins are from India, its ideals can be applied to anyone in the world at any time.

The oils maintain the normal pH of the skin (unlike lotion or soap) while still pulling away impurities and stimulating the lymphatic system. Abhyanga is most commonly used for anxiety and stress relief as well as dry skin and slow digestion. 75 minutes The oils maintain the normal pH of the skin (unlike lotion or soap) while still pulling away impurities and stimulating the lymphatic system.
