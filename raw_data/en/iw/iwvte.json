COVID-19 Vaccine Intervention Delivery for Adults in Southern California](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05022472) open to eligible people ages 16-99 The United States (U.S.) is the country with the largest number of infections and deaths due to COVID- 19 and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected. Acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will be instrumental to ending the pandemic. To this end, 2VIDA! (SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Intervention Delivery for Adults in Southern California) is a multilevel intervention to address individual, social, and contextual factors related to access to, and acceptance of, the COVID-19 vaccine by implementing and assessing a COVID-19 vaccination protocol among Latino and African American (AA) adults (>18 years old) in San Diego. 2VIDA! builds on our previous CBPR efforts and centers on conducting COVID-19 Individual awareness and education, linkages to medical and supportive services, and Community Outreach and Health Promotion in the intervention sites (Phase 1); and offering the COVID-19 vaccine to Latino and AA adults (>18 years old) in federally-qualified health centers and pop-up vaccination stations in communities highly impacted by the pandemic and identifying individual and structural barriers to COVID-19 immunization (Phase 2).

This trial will evaluate S-217622, an anti-SARS-CoV2 3C-like protease inhibitor (PI) developed by Shionogi & Co. Ltd. The study design is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center international clinical trial that will evaluate the clinical efficacy of S-217622 when given in addition to standard of care (SOC) for inpatients with COVID-19. The SOC will be determined by local established guidelines and may include additional DAA (e.g., remdesivir) and immunomodulatory treatment strategies. Certain SOC treatments will be pre-specified prior to randomization.

San Diego, California [Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Study (FLU 003 Plus)](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT01056185) open to eligible people ages 18 years and up Following the sudden and unexpected emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 H1N1) virus, this observational study was initiated to estimate rates of morbidity and mortality and to examine predictors of severity among participants with 2009 H1N1 infection. In 2011, as surveillance indicated that 2009 H1N1 virus was co-circulating with other seasonal influenza A and B viruses worldwide, the protocol was expanded to include other influenza A subtypes and influenza B viruses. The current version of the protocol (released in August 2013) further broadens the scope of this observational study. With the recognition that novel respiratory viruses other than novel influenza A viruses, e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), could become prevalent and of major public health importance, the objectives of this protocol have been expanded.

These regions predominantly house Latino residents, the ethnic minority community most impacted by COVID-19 in San Diego. In the Phase I project, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) partnered with San Ysidro Health (SYH) and the Global Action Research Center, to co-create and demonstrate the impact of a COVID-19 testing program in San Ysidro, one of the most impacted areas from COVID-19 in San Diego County. To date, the project tested >10,000 community members (92% Latino) and received requests to scale-out the testing program to additional primary care clinic sites. In this Phase III project, Community-engaged Optimization of COVID-19 Rapid Evaluation And TEsting Experiences (CO-CREATE-Ex) will extend work with the Phase I community and clinical partners to refine, specify, implement, and evaluate an implementation strategy bundle that optimizes COVID-19 testing, expanding beyond current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to FDA-authorized COVID-19 rapid antigen testing.

Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. Eligible participants will receive a dose of the Sanofi-GSK monovalent (B.1.351) CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 COVID-19 vaccine candidate.. The primary objective is to determine whether a booster dose of the Sanofi-GSK monovalent (B.1.351) CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 COVID-19 vaccine will elicit an increased SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in participants who have failed to maintain an antibody titer >2500 U/mL (using the Roche Elecsys(R) anti-RBD assay) to 2 or more doses of mRNA based COVID-19 vaccine San Diego, California and other locations [COVID-19 Variant Immunologic Landscape Trial (COVAIL Trial)](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05289037) Sorry, in progress, not accepting new patients This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of additional doses of prototype and variant (alone or in combination) vaccine candidates in previously vaccinated participants with or without prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and will evaluate innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses to inform on how to shift the immune response to cover new variants as they emerge. A randomized open-label, non-placebo controlled, multi-site, multi-stage clinical trial in individuals, 18 years of age and older, who are in a stable state of health, has received a complete authorized/approved vaccine series (primary series + booster either with homologous or heterologous vaccine products) >/ = 16 weeks prior to enrollment.

Enrollment will target a goal of approximately 45% of each of the variant vaccine arms to be in older adults (= 65 years of age) for stages 1, 2 and 3 and approximately 20% to have had confirmed COVID-19 for all 4 stages. The primary objective is to evaluate humoral immune responses of candidate SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccines, alone or in combination.

Individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and with or without PASC symptoms will be followed to identify risk factors and occurrence of PASC. This study will be conducted in the United States and participants will be recruited through inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings. Study data including age, demographics, social determinants of health, medical history, vaccination history, details of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, overall health and physical function, and PASC symptoms will be reported by participants or collected from the electronic health record using a case report form at specified intervals. Biologic specimens will be collected at specified intervals, with some tests performed in local clinical laboratories and others performed by centralized research centers or banked in the Biospecimen Repository. Advanced clinical examinations and radiologic examinations will be performed at local study sites with cross-site standardization.
