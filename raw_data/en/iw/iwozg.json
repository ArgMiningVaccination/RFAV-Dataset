The Jumbos have won nine national championships, in men's lacrosse, softball, men's soccer, and field hockey, as well as nine individual titles, in swimming, tennis, and track. Women's basketball, meanwhile, has reached four straight Final Fours and two title games. Just last month, the men's swimming and diving team won its first-ever conference championship. Even football, barely three years removed from a thirty-one-game losing streak, has transformed itself into a NESCAC stalwart. We look at the people, programs, and on- and off-field decisions that, taken together, tell the story of the stunning rise of Tufts athletics.

MONACO President, Tufts University are investing in residential life to strengthen the vibrant campus community that helps undergraduate education at Tufts have a lifelong impact. Finally, because great teachers can change the trajec - tories of student lives, Brighter Worl d will enhance our ability to recruit, retain and support faculty who inspire students with their love of learning, scholarship and exploration. We aim to increase the number of endowed professors through the Professorship Partnership Challenge we have launched this year. By increasing the number of endowed professorships across Tufts, we ensure that generations of students will have access to the best and brightest minds in their fields. In addition to making possible transformational experiences for individual students, Brighter World also leverages the university's unique constellation of schools to generate innovation. Exciting projects bridging the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts and our other schools represent just the newest example of the power of collaboration. And Brighter World will advance Tufts' global impact\u2014strengthening our capacity to address the most significant and complex issues of our era, from disease and social justice to environmental challenges that threaten our planetary future. All of these efforts\u2014no matter how big the questions they confront\u2014depend on individual talents, expertise, and dedication. And that brings me back to why our students are at the heart of our vision for Brighter World . Tufts must continue to do all it can to give its students the resources and opportunities they need and deserve. They are truly our future, and it is their work that will change the world. I am proud to serve this university, and look forward to working with you to ensure that Tufts continues to inspire the next generation of leaders. There is much work for them to do; let us do all we can to make sure they succeed. BRIGHTER WORLD EXTENDS COMMITMENT TO STUDENTS IN RECENT MONTHS I've enjoyed opportu - nities to share with alumni the vision for Brighter World : The Campaign for Tuf ts . Our graduates care passionately about their alma mater, and many share with me how Tufts changed their lives. The university, they say, opened their eyes to new opportunities and allowed them to explore new ideas and careers. Brighter World celebrates, reinforces, and expands our dedication to pro - viding students with life-changing experiences. At its heart, Brighter World will ensure that we remain a student-centered university where extraor - dinary teachers conduct cutting-edge research. For many students, though, the remarkable opportuni - ties afforded by a Tufts education depend on access. Brighter World is already making progress toward its goal of greatly bolstering financial aid. To date, gifts to the campaign exceed $630 million, more than $170 million of which is dedicated to financial aid. Considering that we recently raised $95 million with the Financial Aid Initiative, it's clear that alumni, parents, friends and others understand how crucial financial aid is to the university's mission. We seek to remain a vibrant, inclusive and diverse community, where outstanding students can thrive. Opportunities for personal and intellectual growth also require investments in facilities to support them. Brighter World will permit us to make strategic invest - ments that advance Tufts' distinctive strengths: our capacity for catalyzing creativity, collaboration, and dis - covery; our outstanding research and scholarship; and our commitment to civic engagement. One new facility that embodies this focus is the state-of-the-art Science and Engineering Complex on the Medford/Somerville campus. Its light-filled new labs and teaching spaces bring faculty from across the university to collaborate and exchange ideas, giving students exciting opportuni - ties to work alongside researchers who have the poten - tial to change the world by extending the frontiers of science, technology, and medicine. At the same time, we LettersSPRING 2016 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 3 ILLUSTRATION: JULIAN DE NARVAEZLGBT JUMBO ATHLETES I'm contacting you in regard to Lindsay Tucker's \"In Love and Rugby\" (Fall 2017), which describes the struggles of gay rugby player Nick Nasser, A17. Frankly, publish - ing an article about rugby and sex - uality that only discusses one gay man on the men's team amounts to erasing not only the women's team but the rich history of LGBT community within our team. I understand that an article was written about Nasser in a publication outside of Tufts, and I certainly appreciate the courage it takes to come out. But it's lazy and disrespectful for Tufts Magazine to completely disregard the women's team. Women's sports are largely ignored in mainstream culture, and to see this reflected in a publica - tion at my own university where I have dedicated four years to my sport is disheartening. MEGAN MOONEY, A18 From the editors: Our thanks to Megan Mooney and the other members of the women's rugby team who wrote to express their disappointment with \"In Love and Rugby.\" In sharing the coming-out story that one athlete told in another publication, our intent was not to overlook or to demean the experiences of any other athletes or any other Tufts sports team. We regret that this story landed in a painful way for some readers. WOMEN MINISTERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY Moyne Cubbage's letter to the editor (Fall 2017) about my article \"Tufts' Lost Heritage\" (Spring 2017) offers a different perspective on pioneering women in the clergy. One part of the article discusses the Universalists' groundbreaking ordination of the suffragist Olympia Brown in the mid-nineteenth centu-ry. Cubbage objects, claiming that the ordination of Antoinette Brown Blackwell preceded that of Olympia Brown by a decade. And he's correct. However, what I meant to emphasize was that Olympia Brown was the first woman ordained by a denomination. Unlike Olympia Brown, Antoi - nette Brown Blackwell, a Congrega - tionalist, was ordained without any denominational consent. Indeed, the Congregationalists refused to ordain her, so the ordaining officiator was a Methodist. Her ordination carried with it no association with a denomi - national body. CHARLES GAINES, A58, CRANE61 TUCSON, ARIZONA CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER I was intrigued to discover that Tufts had produced a leading scholar on the life and works of Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll (\"It's a Wonderland Life\" by August A. Imholtz, Jr., Fall 2017). It was interesting to note that this scholar, Morton Cohen, A49, renounced the notion that the heroine of Dodgson's famous Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was Alice Liddell, the daughter of Henry Liddell, who served in the 1850s as headmaster of my high school, Westminster School\u2014an independent school on the grounds of Westminster Abbey that subse - quently named a boarding house after him. Liddell moved from Westminster to become the dean of Christ Church College, Oxford, during Dodgson's tenure as a math - ematics lecturer there. Like Cohen, Dodgson himself maintained that the fictional Alice was not based on Alice Liddell. However, no one disputes that the Liddell children were among the earliest pre-publication audiences of the Alice stories, or that Alice Liddell was a photographic subject of Dodgson, a passionate amateur photographer with a penchant for taking posed pictures of young girls. Personally, I have tended to assume that the episodes in Wonderland where Alice changes size have their origin in Dodgson's photographic portrait sessions with Alice Liddell. Imagine the entertainment of showing a youngster how a subject's size can be enlarged or reduced by altering the length of the bellows on an old-fashioned plate camera such as the one Dodgson would have employed. By curious coincidence, Dodg - son's town of birth, Daresbury in Cheshire, saw the establishment in 1981 of the UK's first synchrotron facility. The new UK synchrotron, Diamond, is located in a village a small distance from Dodgson's eventual hometown, Oxford. For those not in the know, a synchro - tron is a type of particle accel - erator. Many scientists consider the electron beams produced by synchrotrons to be the ultimate means of examining the structures of the substances that surround us, and I feel sure this technology would have fascinated Dodgson. JONATHAN TARGETT, E86 GREAT YARMOUTH, ENGLAND WORD CHOICE IN DENTISTRY I enjoyed the article on Dina Deitsch and her work as director and chief curator for Tufts University Art Galleries (\"Breaking Down Gallery Walls\" by Rob Phelps, Fall 2017). However, I think that a publication representing a university with one of the most prestigious dental schools in the United States should know better than to print an opening sen - tence about \"Picasso prints and historic dental tools.\" Wouldn't you agree that \"instruments\" is a better word? I think that the faculty and students at the School of Dental Medicine would! Nonetheless, I always like your magazine. Keep up the good work! MICHAEL C.

JUST HOW CRAZY is the run of athletic success that Tufts has been on over the past few years? Well, consider the fact that when we began reporting this issue's cover package several months ago, we were confident that we had a good sense of the scope of the project. We spoke with coaches and student-athletes from past and present. We interviewed athletic director John Morris and director of athletics communications Paul Sweeney. We scoured the record books here at Tufts. By the time we were through with all of that digging, and the well-known Boston sportswriter John Tomase, A95, had filed his piece, we knew we had a great story to tell. Tufts may have been somewhat late to athletic glory, but it has been more than making up for lost time. Thanks to the work of three successive athletic directors, a burst of generous philanthropy that has funded the construction and renovation of athletics facilities that are the envy of the Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and some sharp hiring of coaches\u2014who in turn have helped recruit more and more top-flight athletes\u2014 the Jumbos are now accumulating victories at an altogether staggering rate. As Tomase's original draft detailed, the Jumbos in their history had won a total of nine NCAA team championships, forty-five individual championships, and forty-six NESCAC titles\u2014with much of that success (including all of the NCAA team championships) coming since 2010. Now that's quite an impressive develop - ment, especially for a school where on-field winning hasn't always been the norm. So we excitedly set about designing our cover story. But just as we were putting the finishing touches on the whole thing...the Jumbos kept right on winning. It started in February, when the men's swimming and diving team won its first-ever NESCAC title, and, in the process, snapped Williams' string of fifteen straight conference championships. That bit of happy news came early enough that we were able to update the numbers in our story, and work a mention of the victory into Tomase's introduction. Crisis averted! But as I write this, it's a Monday in mid-March and just this past weekend Tufts student-athletes have gone and done it again\u2014twice. At the 2018 Division III indoor track and field championships, Brittany Bowman, A18, set a Tufts record while winning in the 5,000 meters. And Stefan Duvivier, A18, likewise set a school record with his win in the high jump competition. Sadly, these triumphs, which bring to forty-seven the number of Tufts individual championships, came too late in the editorial process to make it into the story that starts on page 20. Suffice it to say that we will all be relieved to at last wrap this issue, because if there's one thing our Jumbo athletes have made clear it's that they have no plans of slowing down any time soon, and we're running out of ways to account for all their winning. The Magic Circle Theater at Tufts puts kids in the spotlight. BY SEAN CORCORAN Summers on Stage IN THEATER, SPACE matters. Whether staged at a gilded playhouse in the city or a rural barn, all theater really needs is a safe space, where creative expression rules. For six weeks each summer, Tufts' Balch Arena Theater becomes a playhouse for young people and by young people. Around seventy children, ages eleven to sixteen, form the Magic Circle per - formance troupe, which is overseen by college-age counselors and adult staff members. Anyone can participate. It's the oldest continuously operated chil - dren's theater east of the Mississippi. Tufts professors started it in 1952, put - ting on Pinocchio and The Emperor's New Clothes . This past summer marked the Continued on next page \u00bb JUMBOS ON THE MOVE SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 5 Tech Workers in the Wild 7 / Document and Protect 8 / Who's Listening In? 15 EDITED BY COURTNEY HOLLANDS Tufts Nowtheater's sixty-fifth anniversary, and it's still going strong. The child actors perform in the round\u2014usually three different produc - tions each summer\u2014and for the kids, there's as much happening offstage as on. They build sets and assemble cos - tumes. A loading dock is often used for painting, and any corner or hallway is a potential spot for stagecraft. And once it's show time, some of the youngest people in the building control the spot - lights, hoist the curtain, and whisper into headsets. \"To this day, when the theater houselights go down and the music begins, I still get goosebumps,\" said Judy Sherkin, who joined Magic Circle at age ten in 1957, and remains a supporter of the program. \"I get that adrenaline rush whenever that hap - pens.\" In one of those early produc - tions, Sherkin\u2014now a resident of Stoneham, Massachusetts\u2014was the stage manager, second-in-command only to the professional director. When it came time to cue the music and light the lights, the director was nowhere to be found. Sherkin waited five minutes in the control room with a college-age counselor. \"He said to me, 'Judy, you're the stage manager, it's up to you. What are we going to do?'\" she remembered. \"I said, 'All right, places everybody! We're starting the show!'\" The director, who'd hit a traffic jam, arrived twenty minutes later. Sherkin's decision to forge ahead on her own stands out all these years later as a shining moment in her life. It gave her the confidence to act when faced with uncertainty, she said. \"It definitely does help you become who you are.\" That's something director Luke Jorgensen has heard before during his twenty-three years with Magic Circle. \"It's a very special place for many people,\" he said. The theater's process starts each year with auditions in February. Would-be \"Magic Circlers\" stand alone on stage and take direction. It's competitive, with as many as one hundred children trying out, which is about thirty more hopefuls than slots. \"The whole point of the program is putting kids into a position where they are not sure they can do this task, but we know they can succeed at it,\" Jorgensen said. Bair Klos, sixteen, recalled her first audition, the summer before sixth grade. It was \"nerve-wracking,\" she said, but it set her on a theater-loving path. \"With friends from school, I always felt very different, so I closed myself off,\" she said. \"But as soon as I made friends at Magic Circle, my life did a 180 and flipped upside down. I am no longer nervous to express myself. If I want to be loud, I'll be loud. If I want to be quiet, I'll be quiet.\" After auditions come the perfor - mances, and then, inevitably, the end of the season. On the program's final night each summer, the kids dress up. There are awards. There's cake and lemonade\u2014and lots of tears. \"They just sob on the last day,\" said Joanne Barnett, director of the Tufts Children's Theater Program. \"All of them, every time. We just hand out the Kleenex.\" But then comes February again, and it's on to the next summer of shows.

BY MOLLY MCDONOUGH ONCE UPON A time, when you thought \"cultural anthropol - ogist,\" you envisioned a researcher in khaki speaking little-known languages while studying people in remote areas. But Nick Seaver, an assistant professor of anthro - pology at Tufts, represents a stark departure from this commonly held image. He conducts his fieldwork in the cafeterias of tech companies, in hotel conference rooms, and through social media exchanges. After graduating from MIT with a master's in media studies, the young researcher wanted to explore a fundamental tension: while music is a cultural product, it's also trapped by equipment and dependent on technology. The year was 2010, and music recommender systems, such as Pandora and Spotify, were changing the way the listening public consumed music. Seaver wanted to do ethnographic research about the employees who were developing these systems, a focus that was not just timely\u2014it was uncharted territory. So he accepted a doctoral position in anthropology at UC Irvine and dove in. The new fieldwork context brought a fresh challenge, namely the fact that tech companies, protective of proprietary information, tend to be wary of outsiders. Yet anthropologists have long studied reluctant groups (think secret societies in native communities, female freemasons in Italy, and stage magicians in France). So while music recommender systems may have been new, the work Seaver was doing was in keeping with what those in his field have long done: map out the cul - tural world of a subset of people. Seaver wanted to know how tech developers working on music recom - mendation algorithms saw their roles, and how their own culture influenced their decisions. To collect data, he reached out online, at conferences, and through academic labs, eventually landing ninety interviews and even an internship at a tech company. These days Seaver is working on a book, tentatively titled Computing Taste: The Making of Algorithmic Music Recommendation , about his big take - away: as technologically advanced as algorithms have become, in the end, we can't separate music selecting systems from the people who develop them. That's because the systems depend on a \"cascading set of little human deci - sions,\" he said, including the criteria used to create and change them. \"There is no such thing as an algorithmic decision,\" Seaver added. \"Algorithms are people.\" And the way they think has implications. This truth is evident in the ways that the workers described their jobs to Seaver. Some saw themselves as garden - ers, weeding out bad songs from the listener's mix. Others considered them - selves more like tour guides, introducing listeners to new songs. And still others spoke of trapping listeners, getting them \"hooked.\" All of these frames of reference affect decision-making in the creation, modification, and evaluation of algo - rithms. In other words, they all wind up influencing which songs we hear. Add it all up and algorithms start to seem a lot less mysterious. \"It's a set of people making a bunch of choices,\" Seaver said. \"And that's something anthropology can do really well\u2014hook technology back into the social world that it came from.\" Something to pon - der with each changing track. SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 7 ILLUSTRATION: CHRIS GASH Document and Protect A new free app designed by a Fletcher grad keeps activists safe. BY HEATHER STEPHENSON IMAGINE YOU'RE AT a pro-democracy rally in a repressive country when the police arrive, clubs swinging. You reach for your phone to document the brutality, but you're worried the authorities will detain you and erase the evidence, or worse: use the fact that you were shooting video to justify additional harassment. How can you capture what's happening without endangering yourself? There's an app for that. Raphael Mimoun, F15, launched the free Whistler app for Android phones in February, just in time to monitor contentious elections in east - ern Europe. It hides in a user's app list and encrypts collected multimedia in a concealed gallery, thereby protecting activists as well as the data they gather. Whistler also embeds metadata to make reports more verifiable. \"We built it from the ground up with security in mind,\" said Mimoun, executive director of Build A Movement (BAM), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that supports democracy advocates around the world. The idea for the app came from Mimoun's conversations with Srdja Popovic, executive director of the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS), a sister organization to BAM that also works with leaders of nonviolent resistance movements. Indigenous groups, citizen journalists, and other activists have all expressed interest in Whistler. In response to reports of arrests and disappearances in the field, the app has a \"panic\" button that alerts trusted contacts that a user is in danger and shares the user's location. It also erases sensitive information. It took Mimoun and a team of part-time developers two years to create Whistler with $150,000 from supporters, including CANVAS, which is chaired by Serbian businessman Slobodan Djinovic, F06. With funding from Jigsaw, a Google incubator, Mimoun hired a German firm to test the app's code for vulnerabilities. If BAM receives additional money, an iPhone version may be next. \"An app is not going to change the world,\" Mimoun said. \"But it can protect people and document injustice, and that's going to help those people change the world.\" CHARACTER SKETCH STEVEN SCHRAGIS, A78 The publishing executive Steven Schragis, A78, was visiting his daughter at Bard College in 2005 when he got an idea. The faculty talks during his trip were so engaging that they made him want to go back to school himself. What if he could take that experience and offer it to people everywhere? His answer to that question, One Day University, launched in 2006. Catering to adults, the traveling lecture series features talks on everything from the ethics of artificial intelligence to films that changed America. Schragis works with professors from top-tier schools, including Tufts (psychology pro - fessor Aniruddh Patel, for one, is an expert on the evolution and biological power of music), to put on two hundred events in sixty cities each year. Here, Schragis talks about his brainchild. onedayu.com TUFTS TIES: The idea of recreating college for the fun of it started with Sol Gittleman. When I was at Tufts, if you stopped forty kids and asked, \"Who's a really cool professor?\" everybody would say Sol. When I was starting to develop my idea, I went to talk to him about it, and over the past decade Sol has probably given a dozen lectures for us. THE WOW FACTOR: We go to a school and try and identify the one, two, or three most popular professors. If one won a Pulitzer or Nobel Prize, that's fine\u2014we don't hold it against him or her! But it doesn't mean anything to us. Instead, we are look - ing for that intangible ability to connect with people. LIFELONG LEARNING: For people who are fifty to seventy-five years old, learning for learning's sake is cool\u2014intellectual stimulation is more worthwhile than it ever was. I also hear a lot from doctors, lawyers, and architects who say that when they were in college, they never took an art or a film course. Now they want to give it a try. WHAT'S NEXT: We're developing different types of programs\u2014theater events, breakfasts, a short film festival. No one ever says, That's it, I've learned enough! We have an almost unlimited supply of interesting topics and professors. \u2014LAURA FERGUSON 8 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Tufts Now PHOTO: SEAN GALLUP/GETTY IMAGES BRAINSTORMS WITHOUT BORDERS The SMFA and the School of Engineering are teaming up to help students find design solutions in unexpected places. BY LAURA FERGUSON WHEN IT COMES to innovative designs that are effective and sustainable, it's tough to beat the work of Mother Nature. That simple fact has inspired both the field of biomimicry\u2014innovation based upon the models and systems found in the environment\u2014and a fascinating new course at Tufts. Foundations of Design: Methods of Making, offered for the first time last fall, used biomimicry to intro - duce students to form and function. The students were asked to create designs for collapsible and expandable objects\u2014looking for ideas in all the ways that plants and animals move to adapt to their environments. Funded by a Tufts Innovates grant, the class was the first to be jointly offered by the School of Engineering and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts (SMFA). It was led by Jennaca Davies, who teaches design technology and metals at the SMFA, and Darryl Williams, dean of undergraduate education at the School of Engineering. \"We kept asking the students, 'What is your inspiration? How do you think about a fish?'\" Davies said. \"We encouraged them to step back and find something in nature to be inspired by and to be creative with.\" Part of the vision when Tufts acquired the SMFA in 2016 was fac - ulty and staff from across the university working together to incor - porate design into all sorts of classes and disciplines. Williams said Foundations of Design was an important step in making that vision a reality. \"Engineering students have expressed wanting more design-based, hands-on experiences in their academic pursuits,\" he said. \"Synergy is a golden opportunity.\" The final project in the Foundations of Design course tasked students with creating a working toy prototype\u2014 suitable for ages two to eight and able to fit in a standard shoebox\u2014using 3-D printers, laser cutters, and other tools in Tufts' Bray Lab. With an eye toward the natural world, one team tucked a carefully folded fabric-and-wood bat into a tube to create a projec - tile game (\"Batzooka\"), while another produced a marble run modeled after an ant colony. The professors hope to offer the class again in the future. In the meantime, Davies is keeping the Tufts Innovates spirit alive this spring by teaching Emotional Design in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, a course that looks at how design and real-world problems intersect. The students are working on ways to meet the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations\u2014including eliminating pov - erty, assuring clean water access, and reducing inequality. Over at the SMFA, meanwhile, Davies is also teaching Biomimicry in Art and Digital Fashion. \"We could build a design commu - nity at Tufts,\" Davies said. \"Our work so far is just a stepping-stone to an innovative future.\" SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 9 PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS Darryl Williams and Jennaca Davies with nature-inspired designs. Snack Well Can incentives entice kids to make better food choices with their own pocket change? BY HELENE RAGOVIN EACH YEAR, AMERICAN kids spend more than $200 billion of their own money on snacks, toys, and other items, with those under twelve spending most of it on junk food, said Friedman School economist Sean Cash, an associate professor who has researched the buying habits of school - children at corner stores. He and his colleagues recorded children purchasing an average of 480 daily calories worth of soda, chips, and candy bars\u2014\"more than a quarter of the calories they're meant to eat in a day,\" he said. In a USDA-funded intervention project known as CHOMPS (Coupons for Healthier Options for Minors Purchasing Snacks), Cash's team looked at what happened when they offered Boston-area kids coupons for discounted produce and snacks that were lower in fat, salt, sugar, and calories than what the children usually picked. Did it work? \"The kids did use the coupons, though not as much as we would have liked,\" Cash said. \"When we offered the coupons, the sales of fruits and vegetables went up tenfold, from a fraction of a per - cent, to more than 3 percent.\" On CHOMPS days, the kids' purchases were overall lower in total fat and calories, and higher in fiber and vitamins A and C. All in all, Cash hopes a project like CHOMPS can motivate kids to think about their behavior as consumers\u2014and teach them to make good food choices when adults aren't around. 10 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Tufts Now PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS; ILLUSTRATION: JULIETTE BORDAEmpowering Pediatric Patients The Floating Hospital is the newest local site for Kids Kicking Cancer, a program that helps pediatric cancer patients control pain via martial arts techniques.

For his fiftieth reunion, Buchanan created a trust to establish a professorship in operative dentistry. For his sixtieth, he made the first major gift toward the tow - er's vertical expansion. The lobby on the fifteenth floor is named in recognition of his gesture. He received the Dean's Medal in 1998. AND ONE TO GROW ON This is a big year for anniversaries at Tufts: the School of Dental Medicine turns 150 in 2018, and the School of Medicine turns 125. To celebrate, let's look back at some of their remarkable alumni, faculty, and achievements. 12 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Tufts Now ILLUSTRATION: SEAN MCCABE; PHOTOS: ON FIGHTING EBOLA I didn't realize how dire the Ebola epidemic was in West Africa until I landed there in 2014. It ravaged communities, and many of my colleagues became ill or passed away. Most people believe they wouldn't make the trip, but when you know how much need is there, you feel beholden to help. I ended up traveling from Boston to Sierra Leone four times. It was very hard for me and my family, but this experience allowed me to put my skills to good use and helped improve the training I provide to US health-care workers. It has drawn me into a lot of policy discussions and scientific areas. It heartens me to see growing awareness about how to confront infectious disease threats better and earlier with initiatives such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and the Global Health Security Agenda. The world is hope - fully waking up to the threat of emerging pathogens and everyday infectious diseases. BHADELIA is medical dire ctor of Boston Medical Center's special pathogens unit and director of infection control and medical response for Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories.

AS GOOD AS HIS WORDS Longtime Sackler School dean Louis Lasagna\u2014he led the school from 1984 to 2002\u2014started his career in pharmacology, concep - tualizing controlled clinical trials and proving that the placebo effect was real and demonstrable. And in 1964, while an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Lasagna suggested a modern take on the Hippocratic oath in the New York Times . His rewrite was quickly adopted by medical schools across the coun - try\u201433 percent of 135 schools polled in 2009 reported administering Lasagna's words. HERE, CURRENT STUDENTS REFLECT ON SOME FAVORITE LINES OF THE OFT-RECITED OATH: \"I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, or a cancerous growth, but a sick human being.\" It seems as tools and technol - ogies grow more advanced, this becomes easier to neglect. . . .

HOW THE FRENCH SAVED AMERICA: SOLDIERS, SAILORS, DIPLOMATS, LOUIS XVI, AND THE SUCCESS OF A REVOLUTION St. Martin's Press The story of America's early relationship with France is somewhat overshadowed by that spot of bother the fledgling nation had with England, and the \"distaste for all things Gallic\" that TOM SHACHTMAN, A63 , notes on the first page of How the French Saved America has carried through to modern times. But as the author points out in this meticulously researched work, France was crucial to the fortunes of the colonies. Without the assistance of our amis across the sea, we might still be singing \"God Save the Queen\" instead of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee.\" THE BODY IN THE CASKET William Morrow Corpses always seem to turn up around caterer and small-town amateur sleuth Faith Fairchild.

FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE: STEPS TO SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Council for Exceptional Children The transition to more independent living can be a Growing Up with the Country: Family, Race, and Nation after the Civil War Yale University Press KENDRA TAIRA FIELD , professor of history and director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at Tufts, examines history through the story of her own black, white, and native Creek ancestors during and after the westward migration in the decades post-emancipation. In particular, she tracks her great-great-grandfather Thomas Jefferson Brown, who founded the Brownsville settlement in what today is Oklahoma; Monroe Coleman, another great-great-grandfather; and Coleman's first cousin, Alexander Davis, who joined Chief Alfred Sam's ill-fated \"back to Africa\" movement after Jim Crow descended on the American Southwest. This captivating, fact-packed book often reads like fiction and touches on little-known episodes in the nation's history such as Native American slaveholdings to explore the intersection of race and power and, as Field writes, \"highlight the centrality of migration and geopolitics in African-American history.\" Continued on page 16 \u00bb 14 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Tufts Now PHOTO: ALONSO NICHOLSWho's Listening In? In a new book, Tufts cybersecurity expert Susan Landau says it's more important than ever to protect our data and communications. BY TAYLOR MCNEIL THE COUPLE WHO killed fourteen people in San Bernardino in December 2015 had destroyed their personal smartphones, but a work iPhone was later found and the FBI wanted to get inside it. The trouble was, if investigators failed to figure out its four-digit password in ten attempts, the phone was programmed to destroy its data. So the FBI implored Apple to create an update that would undo the phone's security protections. The company refused, saying the update would weaken security for all users. As the case wended its way through the courts, the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held hearings. One of the key experts testifying was Susan Landau, now Bridge Professor in Cybersecurity at Tufts, where she splits her time between the Fletcher School and the School of Engineering. Her take was unequivocal: weakening the security on one iPhone weakens it on all iPhones, and that's bad for US security. Landau details her concerns in a new book, Listening In: Cybersecurity in an Insecure Age , which furthers her argument that securing our data is essential for securing us. At the same time, improv - ing security means that the data of bad actors\u2014from terrorists to garden-variety criminals\u2014is also secure, and increasingly hidden from law enforcement. So does secure data for all mean that law enforcement and national security take a back seat to privacy? The answer, according to Landau, is no. \"The NSA says they're doing better than ever. They know that most things they want to investigate will be dark\u2014not accessible,\" she said. \"That's just the way things are going, regardless of how the US tries to constrain manufacturers.\" There is no way a manufacturer can create a backdoor for law enforcement, Landau said, without it being found and exploited by hackers, giving them carte blanche to access everyone's computer systems, and in the long run do serious damage to national security. Landau, whose specialty is surveil - lance, writes about the trouble with insecure data. \"I think everybody has a sense that it won't happen to me,\" she said. \"Nobody thinks about what their particular threats are, nobody thinks about what it is that they need to protect.\" She cited the breach at Sony Pictures in 2014, when hackers broke into the company's computer systems and stole huge amounts of informa - tion, including embarassing corpo - rate memos and copies of unreleased movies. \"Sony was making films, and thought of itself as a film company,\" Landau said. \"The mental model of the executives was probably a canister of film, not bits\u2014computer data.\" Banks, however, quickly realized that money \"is all about the bits,\" she said. \"When you do a money transfer, nobody carries bills from bank A to bank B, they just do a bit transaction. They have known for a long time they need to protect the bits.\" What can we personally do to keep our data secure? \"The most import - ant thing is to do automatic updates for everything you use,\" Landau said. \"Don't say, I'm too busy now\u2014just do it.\" Use two-factor authentication when it's available, and, of course, think before you click on a link or open an attachment\u2014that's the way most cyber exploits work. The same is true for governments and businesses\u2014only more so. Security measures should be built into every system, Landau said, and access to critical pieces should be limited to a very small number of trusted\u2014and careful\u2014people. After all, it's not if but when the next attack will occur. \"Cybersecurity protections, including encrypted communications and secured com - munications, are far more critical now than they were even five years ago,\" Landau said.

ALL THE LIES WE LIVE Publerati This novel is the final installment in the tragicomic Normal Family Trilogy by CALEB MASON, A78 (writing under the pseudonym Don Trowden). It starts with Henry Pendergast, whom we met as a boy in the 1960s at the beginning of the series, celebrating his eightieth birthday on a remote Maine island with a hurricane bearing down and family issues still at the fore. Will he ever find contentment? THE SEVEN SORROWS Divertir Publishing \"The man who had less than one hour to live raised himself up on an elbow, craned his neck, and peered out of his filthy window.\" So begins The Seven Sorrows , a debut thriller from GREGG KUEHN, A69 , in which thirty-three-year-old marine biologist KC Jameson finds him - self embroiled in international intrigue after his boss, an exotic-weapons col - lector, orders him to uncover a trove of nuclear weapons in the West Indies with little more than a single, cryptic clue to go on. The fast-paced tale heats up as Jameson and his wary assistant, Nikki Colt, race against Russian mercenaries, the US military, and, of course, time.The Ghosts of Gombe: A True Story of Love and Death in an African Wilderness University of California Press In 1989, DALE PETERSON , a lecturer in Tufts' English department, consulted Jane Goodall for a book he was writing about chimpanzees. Through that experience he learned the story of Ruth Davis, a twenty-five-year-old American volunteer at Goodall's research camp in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park who walked into the forest one summer day in 1969 to follow a chimp and never returned. Six days later her body was found at the base of waterfall miles away. The Ghosts of Gombe , due out next month, is a literary forensic tale that unravels the mystery of what happened to Davis. It also unpacks the lifelong effect the tragedy had on those closest to her and reveals, for the first time, everyday life in Goodall's camp. From the creepy vision of Davis that came to her former boyfriend nearly four decades after her demise and set Peterson on his quest to find the truth to the final scenes, where some measure of har - mony is restored, this unusual true whodunit is spellbinding.

SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 17 MIXED MEDIA Founders and Frenemies A new book by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Gordon Wood, A55, chronicles the intertwined lives and politics of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. BY TAYLOR MCNEIL hierarchical world where they had very little sense of a threat from common white people, the electorate. Whereas the Federalists were in a much more middling society, which was much more volatile, much more democratic than the society of the South. The conservative leaders were threatened all the time by the possibility of popu - lar unrest. So they were much more suspicious of democracy. And of course Adams was part of that, but he feared aristocrats as much as democrats. He really didn't trust anyone. In the end you laud Jefferson for his ability to inspire Americans, and seem to dismiss Adams for his pessimism. Frankly, I like Adams, I find him more akin to my own sensibility. But Adams can't be the spokesman for the nation. He was a realist, he was cynical and pessimistic and opposed to America's sacred myths. He denied the excep - tionalism of the United States, and denied the American belief in equality. Jefferson's message, that all men are created equal, has become the most important part of the Declaration of Independence, and the source of Jefferson's fame. This message of all men being created equal is what allows a diverse nation like ours to survive. It may be that Adams is more accurate, more realistic, but certainly that's not a message that could inspire the people of the United States. Jefferson's great words transcend his racism and his other personal weaknesses.JOHN ADAMS AND Thomas Jefferson first became friends in 1776 at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. However, the two men \"differed in almost every conceivable way,\" said historian Gordon Wood, A55, H10. In his latest book, Friends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , Wood highlights the contrasts. But the book is not just a study of two men. It's also a primer on what divided the country at its founding, and to some extent divides it today: North and South; Federalists, who believed in a larger role for government, and Republicans, who wanted to limit it. I recently spoke with Wood\u2014the Alva O. Way University Professor emeritus at Brown University, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and a former Tufts trustee\u2014about Adams, Jefferson, and the lessons of history. How did Jefferson and Adams become friends? What drew them together was the revo - lutionary movement. They were both radicals. When Jefferson joined the Continental Congress, where Adams had already been hard at work, they both agreed on opposing the British. And later, when Jefferson joined Adams abroad as minister in Paris, Jefferson was a widower, and John and Abigail took him under their wing. He became really fascinated by this family, espe - cially by Abigail. I think he'd never really experienced a family like the Adamses, and he became part of it. What divided them? They were divided by politics and political partisanship. Adams was a great admirer of the English consti - tution\u2014and Jefferson, who despised England, was a real radical and an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, which Adams hated. By the 1790s, they didn't share very much, except for having a common enemy in Alexander Hamilton. The presidential election of 1800, when Adams lost to Jefferson, was devastating to him, and he didn't easily forget it. He and Jefferson had no contact for a dozen years afterward. It took two years of work by a mutual friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, to bring these two men together again in 1812. And from then until their deaths in 1826, they exchanged 158 letters. You say Jefferson was a radical, but he was also an aristocrat. That's the paradox of the early republic\u2014the leaders of the popular Republican Party came from the most socially conservative, hierarchical, slaveholding areas. The conservative leadership, the Federalists, on the other hand, came from New England, which was by far the most democratic and egalitarian area of the new repub - lic. The paradox is understandable, because the slaveholding planters in the South didn't really know what democracy was like.

For a long time, this bisection symbolized the detached relationship between academics and sports. \"We were literally across the tracks,\" said former athletic director Bill Gehling, A74, AG79, A05P. \"It was the perfect analogy.\" Athletics, in other words, were not always a top priority at Tufts. In 1995, for instance, the men's basketball team lost the right to host its first-ever NCAA tournament game because the Cousens Gym court was four feet short of regulation. Without a home of its own, the crew team rented space in Harvard's boathouse. And when recruits toured the old athletic offices, they would enter Halligan Hall through what Gehling described as \"the bottom of a loading dock.\" Well, times have changed. A board of athletic overseers, as well as generous alums like the Kraft and Tisch families, have raised millions for facilities that are the envy of the New England Small College Athletic Conference. An impressive lineup of outstanding young coaches was hired, leading to a parade of talented student-athletes. The result? Since 2010, the Jumbos have won nine national championships, in men's lacrosse, softball, men's soccer, and field hockey, as well as nine individual titles, in swimming, tennis, and track. Women's basketball, meanwhile, has reached four straight Final Fours and two title games. Just last month, the men's swimming and diving team won its first-ever conference championship. Even football, barely three years removed from a thirty-one- game losing streak, has transformed itself into a NESCAC stalwart. Athletics, it's safe to say, are no longer on the wrong side of the tracks at Tufts. In the pages ahead we'll look at how six of the university's signature sports programs turned things around. We'll meet scholar-athletes whose example of excellence has remained inspiring years after graduation. And we'll examine the on- and off-field decisions that, taken together, tell the story of the stunning rise of Tufts athletics. How Tufts became a sports powerhouse. BY JOHN TOMASE, A95 ILLUSTRATION BY SEAN MCCABEJumbos Rising 20 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018Caution to the Wind The Tufts sailing team has been winning championships for five decades. The Bacow Sailing Pavilion, home to Tufts' sailing team, is tucked away on Medford's Upper Mystic Lake\u2014just three miles from campus, but off the radar for most. So, too, are the victories of this powerhouse team, which has been quietly amassing national championships and accolades for more than fifty years. Since 1980, the team has been led by Ken Legler, the longest-tenured coach at the university. \"I think sailing is supposed to be fun,\" Legler said. \"That said, a lot of people spell fun w-i-n.\" And win his teams do\u2014twenty national championships in all. Legler's teams have featured thirty-six female and thirty-two male All-Americans, nine Olympians, and three College Sailors of the Year. And Legler is only Tufts' most recent standout sailing coach. His predecessor, Joe Duplin, won seven national championships while coaching the Jumbos from 1967 to 1980. Both coaches were aided by the exploits of the Olympic-caliber sailor Manton Scott, who sadly died while only a sophomore, in 1973, but whose reputation drew attention and recruits to Tufts. The team has more than held its own in the crowded New England college sailing scene ever since. Not that Legler lets the success go to anyone's head.

Daly, A95, had starred for the Jumbos in both football and baseball, yet his resume lacked just one tiny detail: he had never actually played lacrosse. \"I was in over my head,\" Daly admitted. \"But looking back, being an outsider was my biggest asset.\" The lacrosse style of the day required athletes who could win slogging, \"ground and pound\" games. Daly instituted a frenetic pace that constantly pushed the attack, and quickly proved successful. In the two years before Daly's hiring, the Jumbos went a combined 3-25. In his second year on the job they produced a win - ning record. By 2010, Tufts had gone 20-1 and claimed the school's first national championship in front of twenty thousand fans at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium. After more titles in 2014 and 2015, Daly left to coach at Brown. He was replaced by former three-sport standout Casey D'Annolfo, A06, whose team opened 2017 with a school-record eleven wins. \"We started this journey because I wanted these kids to have the same experience I did playing sports at Tufts,\" Daly said. \"When it finally culminated in that first championship, it showed what Tufts is capable of.\" PHOTOS: ANNA MILLER (LACROSSE); ALONSO NICHOLS (SAILING); KELVIN MA (SCHMIDT) 22 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Johann Schmidt 2010-2014 With no diving well at Tufts, Johann Schmidt and his teammates trav - eled to MIT each day for practice. Schmidt worked his way to winning two NCAA diving titles off the one-meter board, first in 2012 and again in 2014. \"In almost every single practice, we saw an incremental improvement,\" Tufts coach Brad Snodgrass said. \"That's really, really hard to do at any age.\" TUFTS ALL STARPHOTOS: PAUL RUTHERFORD (BASKETBALL); ALONSO NICHOLS (FOURNIER)TEAM BUILDING Women's Basketball NEW ENGLAND BASKETBALL fans know Carla Berube. She sank the free throws that clinched the University of Connecticut's first national championship in 1995. When she became the Jumbos head coach in 2002, her initial class of recruits considered her a celebrity. Sixteen years later, Berube's name is no longer the selling point\u2014\"Kids are like, 'My grandfather remembers you,'\" she recalled with a laugh\u2014but it doesn't have to be. The draw is now her program. The Jumbos entered the 2018 season with four straight Final Four berths and two appearances in the national title game. They haven't lost more than four games in a season since 2012, and the last decade has produced the top two scorers in school history: Michela North, A17, and Colleen Hart, E11. Berube in part credits the university's commitment to top-flight facilities. \"When you bring a recruit in now, the campus is beautiful,\" she said. \"You come to the Tisch Sports and Fitness Center, it's awesome\u2014you don't find a fitness center as nice at our level. Kids want to play for great programs and vie for national championships.\" Perhaps nowhere is that goal now more realistic than on the hardwood at Tufts.

Fournier's pitching dominance led the Jumbos to an unprecedented three consec - utive NCAA championships, from 2013 to 2015, and in her senior year, Tufts posted a perfect 51-0 season. \"What set Allyson apart from every other pitcher of her caliber was she did not let you beat her twice,\" said Jo Clair, Fournier's catcher at Tufts. \"If you beat her once, you're lucky. Beat her twice? Not going to happen.\" TUFTS ALL STAR BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME A donor-funded construction boom has transformed campus with new and improved facilities like these: * STEVE TISCH SPORTS AND FITNESS CENTER Completed in 2012, the 42,000-square- foot center offers everything teams need, including a film room, sports medicine suite, and expanded Lunder Fitness Center.

SPICER FIELD Renovated in 2015, the softball complex has a new surface and scoreboard, plus new dugouts, bleachers, and more. BELLO FIELD The home of men's soccer and lacrosse was refreshed in 2015, an update on the $1.8 million synthetic turf from 2004. \u2014LAURA FERGUSONTEAM BUILDING Men's Soccer IN THE 2014 NCAA tournament, the Tufts men's soccer team stood just one victory from its first-ever Final Four. Unfortunately, the power - house Messiah College team blocking its path had won thirty-nine straight games\u2014and eight of the previous ten national titles. So when Jason Kayne, A16, scored less than a minute into the match, and goalkeeper Scott Greenwood, A17, made the goal stand in a 1-0 victory, the Jumbos realized they belonged. \"We knew going in that was an outrageous Messiah team we'd have to run into in the Elite Eight,\" said coach Josh Shapiro. \"Then when you beat them you say, 'Well why not? If we can beat that group, we can beat anybody.'\" Two weeks later, Tufts claimed its first national championship, and then added a second title in 2016. The way Shapiro sees it, success begets success. After men's lacrosse and field hockey blazed a championship trail, the other teams at Tufts have followed. \"The ceiling was smashed, so let's go for it,\" Shapiro said. \"The last few years have proven it's all attainable, so let's be ambi - tious and try to create best-case scenarios for teams to hunt championships.\" PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS (SOCCER); JOANIE TOBIN (BOATHOUSE) ...Which is not to say that our older facilities didn't have their charms. Here, Ed Ellison, A83, recalls what it was like to run on the old track that circled the basketball court in Cousens Gym. \"The open side we called the Cage, because it was surrounded by cargo netting. The other side of the track ran under the basketball grandstands. We called it the Tunnel. In the longer races, right before the finish line, the runners would disappear into the Tunnel for ten to fourteen seconds, and the crowd would quiet down. It had a mysterious feel to it. As a home athlete, you seized it. You learned to kick\u2014to reserve your energy until the end of the race, pass in the Tunnel, and come out in the lead. The home crowd would go crazy. You'd feel you were getting shot out of a cannon.\" \u2014AS TOLD TO MONICA JIMENEZ 24 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Chance Brady 2013-2017 Of the several Tufts football records that Brady set during his career, the most im - pressive may be his 210 points scored, break - ing Fred \"Fish\" Ellis' previous mark, which had stood for eighty-eight years. That's the same \"Fish\" Ellis for whom Tufts' football stadium is named. Brady's efforts helped make the Jumbos one of the top NESCAC football teams. \"I wanted to do everything I could to put the team forward,\" Brady said. \"I did not have my eyes on anything specific other than just winning.\" 45 INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS WON BY JUMBOS TEAM BUILDING Softball AFTER WINNING THREE straight national titles, from 2013 to 2015, coach Cheryl Milligan's softball program has become a national power. Along the way, the team has illustrated how athletics can enrich academics. \"We get kids who choose us over the Ivy League because the Ivy League doesn't win,\" said Milligan, J95, N12, AG01. \"Winning is very exciting, and if you go to Princeton, you're not winning a national championship.\" That puts Tufts in play for student-athletes like Allyson Fournier, E15, who is quite simply the greatest pitcher in the history of Division III softball. Fournier, who these days is a chemical engineer, chose Tufts over Cornell and Williams in 2011, and rewrote the record books. Tufts went 115-5 during the four-time All-American's career, including an unprecedented 51-0 in 2015. \"We had it on our list of goals for a long time to win a national title,\" Milligan said. \"We knew it would take time, especially with the NESCAC and our admissions standards, making sure you're bringing in the right kids.\" The result is a program with recruits hailing not just from the Northeast, but Texas, California, Florida, Colorado, and Illinois. Forget about being a regional draw\u2014the Jumbos are now an athletic and academic force on the national stage.LEADING THE CHARGE 3 Athletic directors who've led Tufts into the modern sports era. They are: Rocky Carzo 1973-1999 Bill Gehling 1999-2015 John Morris 2015-present 699 Career wins, entering this season, by baseball head coach John Casey 7 Tufts coaches named regional and/or conference coaches of the year in 2016-2017 47 NESCAC CHAMPIONSHIPS WON BY TUFTS TEAMS SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 25 TUFTS ALL STAR PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS (BRADY, SOFTBALL)FIELD HOCKEY MAY be concentrated largely in the Northeast, but a case can be made that no team did more to lay the groundwork for Tufts' athletic prominence at the national level. Before men's lacrosse brought the school its first national title in 2010, it drew inspiration from the 2008 field hockey squad, which reached the national championship game under head coach Tina McDavitt Mattera, a former member of Team USA and a silver medal winner at the 2005 Pan Am Games. Then, in 2012, field hockey won a Division III crown of its own after defeating Montclair State in the championship game. Emily Cannon, A14, nearly broke her hand in that game, but stayed on the field because, as she recalled, \"there's no way I was coming out.\" She considers the field hockey experience among her most cherished memories at Tufts, but believes the wins benefited more than just her teammates. They also lifted the university's profile among potential applicants. \"Even if sports aren't a driving reason why someone goes to a school, it could be why you hear about it,\" she said. \"We have gotten a lot of press because of programs doing really well. Men's soccer exploded. Field hockey are contenders. Lacrosse. Having that notoriety could open your eyes to the possibility of a school.\"TEAM BUILDING Field Hockey Welcome to the Club Want more evidence of Tufts' recent athletic success? Look no further than club sports. Club sports at Tufts may not be as intensely com - petitive as their varsity counterparts, but our teams have been doing plenty of winning. The women's ultimate Frisbee club, for instance, has made nationals four years in a row. Then there's the men's rugby team, which last year made it to the national championship game. The equestrian club, meanwhile, placed tenth at the national cham - pionship in 2015 and has won five consecutive regional titles. And don't forget about skiing, with the women last year racing to second place in the Thompson Division of the United States Collegiate Ski Association, and the men placing third. In all, there are twenty-three club sports at Tufts\u2014everything from cycling and karate to rock climbing and fencing\u2014and 750 or so students participate in them. What's driving this lively scene? Taegan Williams, E18, co-captain of Tufts' newest club, women's water polo, says that club sports combine scheduling flexibility and enjoyable competition: \"Being on a club team has allowed me to find the right balance between academics and extracurriculars, especially as a mechanical engineering major.\" \u2014LAURA FERGUSON PHOTOS:ANNA MILLER (FIELD HOCKEY); COURTESY OF TUFTS WOMEN'S RUGBY 26 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Mitchell Black 2012-2016 Cut from the soccer team as a freshman, Black went on to become a four-time NCAA track champion, and one of the most accomplished individual athletes in Tufts history. In 2016, he received the NCAA's prestigious Walter Byers Postgrad - uate Scholarship. \"Mitchell's accom - plishments in the classroom, on the track, and in the community have set him up to reach for the stars as he pursues his goal of becoming an astronaut,\" said Andrew Alia, chair of the scholarship committee. TUFTS ALL STAR TEAM BUILDING Football THE VIDEO TELLS the story of one of the most important days in Tufts football his - tory: September 20, 2014. It's the season opener against Hamilton and the home stands are sparsely filled. Tufts has lost thirty-one games in a row, the longest losing streak in the nation. Before long, however, Chance Brady, A17, scores and the Jumbos are ahead 7-0. Word starts to filter through campus. As Tufts opens a 24-10 lead in the third quarter, more students arrive to cheer on the team. They can sense that something big is about to happen. \"The guy who runs facilities texted me, 'I don't know if I can keep the fans off the field when the game ends,'\" recalled then-athletic director Bill Gehling. \"I told him, 'Why would you want to?'\" When the 24-17 win is complete, hundreds of students hop the fences at Zimman Field to celebrate. Victory chants can be heard from the Jumbos locker room. To many, a school's athletic renaissance cannot be considered complete without a legitimate football team. \"I've always believed every single sport is important,\" Gehling said, \"but there's a subset of alums that will never think you're really successful unless that team wins, too.\" Tufts has delivered under coach Jay Civetti. The former Division I assistant at Boston College built the Jumbos from the ground up, culminating in 2016's 7-1 finish. Since 2015, Tufts has won 18 games, the team's best three-year stretch in nearly four decades. And it feels like only the beginning. Genevra Stone 2008-2014 After enrolling at Tufts Medical School in 2008, Stone became a two-time Olympian, winning the silver medal in the single sculls at the 2012 Olympics, and competing again at the 2016 games. \"When you're moving the boat correctly, it's as close as humans can get, in a way, to flying,'' Stone said to the Boston Globe in 2015. \"When you get it right it's just, it's a really amaz - ing sensation.''

Then he set out to save the butterfly, and with it the world. THE THE THE 28 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 BUTTERFLY EFFECT BUTTERFLY EFFECT BUTTERFLY EFFECT THE BUTTERFLY EFFECTSPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 29 BUTTERFLY ission, texas, is about as far south as a person can get in the Lone Star State, directly atop the Mexican border and just seventy miles west of the Gulf. The streets here are wide and straight, the buildings bleached to pastels. On Sundays, Father Roy, the cowboy priest of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church, holds mass with his dogs, and usually some country music, too. Mission was the unlikely landing spot, twenty-four years ago, for a molecular geneticist from New Jersey who, having already pioneered the science of genetic fingerprinting, had made himself into one of the country's leading experts on, of all things, butterflies. Jeffrey Glassberg, A69, had come to believe that the delicate but - terfly, so susceptible to the slightest disturbances in its ecosystem, was a kind of flying early warning system that offered crucial insight into how human activity was nega - tively impacting the environment. If we could find a way to protect and preserve the butterfly, Glassberg was fond of saying, then we could save ourselves in the bargain. For these reasons, and the simple fact that he found butterflies to be beautiful and endlessly fascinating, Glassberg had founded the North American Butterfly Association, or NABA, in 1992. He also had a side business of sorts, tak - ing clients on butterfly-watching expeditions around the US and Mexico. And it was one of those trips that brought Glassberg to Mission in 1994. The part of Texas where the town is located, the Lower Rio Grande Valley, is particularly fertile butterfly ground, sitting at the territorial intersection of the roughly six hundred species in the US and Mexico's eighteen hundred. Glassberg showed up in Mission outfitted in a manner befitting the founder of NABA\u2014bucket hat, pants tucked in his socks, cameras, binoc - ulars, all of it. He led his tiny group to the outskirts of town, where the sunflowers grew wild on the side of the road, and farmers planted fields of sor - ghum and sugarcane. At a bend in the Rio Grande that separates the US from Mexico, the visitors neared the ruined beauty of an old Oblate monastery, once the province of local missionaries. It was quiet that day, no one else was around. There were wildflowers and grass, sunshine and butterflies. And suddenly, Glassberg had a thought: \"This could be a butterfly park.\" Over the next quarter century, Glassberg would go on to become one of the country's most respected butterfly experts. And right there in Mission, he would open that park\u2014the National Butterfly Center\u2014partly to preserve and celebrate the creatures he loves so much, and partly to, in his own small way, help save the world. Along the way, he would change how we observe and talk about butterflies, and even how we think about them. But there would be difficulties, too, some of them more painful than he could have imagined. T T T There has never been a time in Jeffrey Glassberg's life that he didn't love butterflies. He chased them as a five-year-old on Long Island with a butterfly net. On summer breaks while at Tufts, he and his childhood friend Bob Robbins, AG78, now curator of lepidoptera\u2014moths and butterflies\u2014at the Smithsonian Institution, braved cargo planes of live chickens during flights to PHOTOS: JEFFREY GLASSBERG The butterflies Glassberg has captured with his camera lens include, clockwise from left: a great spangled fritillary in the inland forests of central California; a flaming firetip in the remote province of Napo, in Ecuador; and a Neild's greatstreak in the Ecuadorian town of Banos, near the Amazon Basin. 30 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 M M M MColombia just to catch a glimpse of new butterflies. But for all Glassberg's love of butter - flies, they were only a hobby. After earn - ing his PhD at Rice University in Texas, he and two friends cofounded a small genetics company in 1982. Five years later, the company's technology and courtroom testimony helped win the first-ever conviction based on forensic DNA evidence in a US criminal trial, ushering in the modern CSI era. \"It was a game-changer for people worldwide,\" said Michael Baird, who was then a vice president at the com - pany, known as Lifecodes. \"The reality is, Glassberg's insights, his thoughts, they really have changed the world.\" In 1986, Glassberg sold his shares in Lifecodes for a small fortune. He bought a burgundy Jaguar for his wife, Jane Vicroy Scott, and a concert grand piano for himself. Two years later, he retired. The money from Lifecodes bought Glassberg something else, too: the rare freedom in life to do as he pleased. And what he pleased was to devote himself utterly to butterflies. When he founded NABA in 1992, it allowed him to both pursue his passion and share it with Jane. He'd met the brilliant, dark-haired love of his life when he was at Rice and she was studying at the nearby Baylor College of Medicine. They would picnic on Baylor's sun-drenched grounds, and he would point out the names of all the butterflies that flew around them. She didn't find it strange. She was a scientist, too. In its first year, NABA grew to approximately three hundred mem - bers. Glassberg published a butterfly field guide, and sent out the first issue of the quarterly magazine American Butterflies . He even formed a committee to standardize the hodgepodge of com - mon names that had plagued American butterfly classifiers. In his organiza- tion, Vanessa cardui would no longer be known as a painted lady, thistle butterfly, painted beauty, cosmopolite, cosmopolitan, thistle cynthy, and Cynthia of the thistle. Henceforth, it would just be a painted lady. Butterflies have long fascinated humans. Their likenesses have been found in cave paintings and Pompeii ruins. In literature and local lore, they've represented freedom and purity, sin and vanity, divine art, resurrection, and messengers of death. But these insects have as much to tell us about the future as the past. Butterflies are an indicator species\u2014they are exqui - sitely attuned to the environment, often requiring a balanced native ecosystem in order to thrive. This means specific plants, the right soils, healthy populations of other native fauna. When a land becomes deranged, butterflies are among the first things to disappear. And today, as human development encroaches further into the natural world, and climate change and pesticides wreak their havoc, global butterfly populations are plummeting to the point where even the most common species now are seen \"in scores rather than hundreds,\" as one noted conservationist wrote in 2016. Several have already disappeared for - ever. \"If a species is going extinct, that tells you that the habitat has changed,\" said Ernest Williams, a lepidopterist at Hamilton College in New York. \"It's a canary in a coal mine that's telling you things are changing on the earth's surface in a way that could not support a living organism that was there.\" To Glassberg, this means that if most of the butterflies of the world still survive, then there is hope for us. There is enough clean water and balanced, healthy land left in the world to support our needs. \"But if all the butterflies are gone,\" he said, \"then I don't see how humans are going to survive as a species.\" T T T The naba mission is to save the world by making people care about butterflies. The organization wants to get people to want to help butterflies\u2014to lobby for them, to protect their habitat, to plant butter - fly-friendly flowers, and to spend time outdoors around them. It's butterflies as a kind of gateway drug to conservation. Today, NABA has five thousand members and more than eighteen thousand social media followers, and Left: Glassberg and his wife, Jane Vicroy Scott, in June of 1986 at Bear Mountain in New York State. Above: The couple at a friend's wedding around 1999. PHOTO: KATHY MALONE (UPPER RIGHT) SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 31 Jeffrey Glassberg has become a big name in butterfly circles. He has pub - lished nine field guides over the years, and recruited thousands of people each summer to participate in nationwide butterfly counts that produce valu - able data for scientists like Leslie Ries, who studies ecology at Georgetown University. \"These projects are just critical for us to be able to look at long-term trends, climate change patterns, changing land use patterns on conti - nental scales,\" Ries explained. He has also given common names to nearly all of Mexico and Central America's twenty-four hundred butterflies, inspiring Mexico to do the same in that country's scores of native languages and dialects. Here in the States, meanwhile, media outlets from the New York Times to Fox News regularly offer butterfly garden tips, and a 2013 study found that Americans were willing to spend more than $4 billion to save the monarchs. \"It's not been very long, and the popularity of butterflies has grown so much,\" said Jonathan Pelham, another renowned butterfly expert. \"And if you're going to put a finger on someone responsible, it's Jeffrey Glassberg.\" For all its growth and accomplish - ments, however, NABA has remained a cozy organization, run out of Glassberg's home in New Jersey. It's had a tightknit board comprised mostly of Glassberg's close friends, a tiny staff for administrative tasks, and, of course, Jane. She had her own career, at Lederle Laboratories, part of the Fortune 100 company American Cyanamid, where she was director of business develop - ment. But in her spare time, she was NABA's treasurer, secretary, and, in a sense, COO. They were a team, Jeffrey with his wild, big ideas, and Jane with her eye for details. Jane had another crucial duty as well\u2014functioning as a kind of emo - tional translator for Glassberg. He may have been unquestionably brilliant, but he wasn't always easy to be around. He had a tendency to say exactly what he thought, without hesitation and with absolute certainty. That didn't always go over well. Take, for instance, his comments to me about the once-popular practice of catching and killing butterflies for collections instead of just observing them. Glassberg used to collect, but swore off the practice in the mid-1980s. Collecting, he told me, may have had its use before cameras, but was now \"completely pointless\" and \"pathetic,\" the sort of thing done by \"failed human beings.\" \"Glassberg is not a shrinking violet,\" the University of California, Davis lepidopterist Art Shapiro told me. \"And as you've probably noticed, he has enemies.\" When I asked the celebrated author Robert Michael Pyle about Glassberg, he responded: \"I admire Jeff very much and I like him. Sometimes I'm at pains to like him, but I do. But a lot of people of substance have written him off altogether and formed some pretty big schisms where there should be cooperation.\" He was not, Glassberg himself admitted, warm and fuzzy. \"I end up making people feel bad about them - selves,\" he told me. \"It's never my intention. I'm just interested in the idea, as opposed to the people.\" Jane, on the other hand, was a natural with people. She had that easy Southern charm. \"She can talk to people and move the goal forward, making them feel good about themselves,\" Glassberg Top left: Glassberg with his butterfly field guide.

So it was Jane who answered the phones at NABA, and who accompa - nied Glassberg on many of his fund - raising trips, smoothing his way. I I I It took eight years of planning, fundraising, and schmoozing (with a lot of help from Jane), but in 2002 NABA finally acquired the title to one hundred acres of former onion field in Mission, Texas, that would become the National Butterfly Center. For years, Glassberg has spent one week each month in the town. A director for the day-to-day operations was soon hired, and work began on the plantings that would attract and sustain the butterflies. Workers put down crucita shrubs with pale blue blossoms, native sage, red and pink lantanas, and glorious purple passionflower vines. Forests of Texas ebony and yellow-flowered retama were created, along with small prairies of rare grasses and wildflowers. Nearly all the plants were native to the region. \"They are setting out to do more for plant diversity than our agency has,\" said Chris Best, a botanist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and an informal advisor to the center. \"It's not a very large piece of land, but a huge multiplier.\" The NBC officially opened in 2004. When I visited last summer, nearly two hundred species of native plants had been restored, drawing two hundred thirty-five species of butterflies\u2014up from the thirty that had been counted before the revegetation. The center had also become a haven to wildlife of all kinds. Armadillos, bobcats, and javelina have all been seen strolling through the center, and the region is home to some five hundred different kinds of birds. The back seventy acres of the center are kept wilder to form a link in a chain of protected lands and wildlife refuges along the Rio Grande and up the Gulf Coast. This corridor is the only home left for the fewer than one hundred ocelots that are estimated to remain in the country. These days, the NBC attracts about thirty thousand people a year, including six thousand schoolchildren who come for field trips and summer camps. The center runs Mission's annual butterfly festival, and there are now massive SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 33 butterfly statues throughout the city, including one at the entrance to City Hall. \"It's definitely a priority for the city of Mission,\" said Deputy City Manager Aida Lerma, whose office decor includes several model butterflies. \"When it was just brush, it was like...Really?\" she said. \"But as it has evolved, I can certainly understand what it's going to become and what it's going to mean not only for the city of Mission but also for the entire Rio Grande Valley. And we couldn't be prouder.\" What it becomes, however, may depend in good part on the fate of President Trump's proposed wall along the border with Mexico. Not long after I visited the NBC, a story appeared in the Texas Observer . \"For at least six months,\" it began, \"private contractors and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have been quietly prepar - ing to build the first piece of President Trump's border wall through the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in South Texas.\" Located about twenty miles east of the NBC, Santa Ana is one of the several national parks in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The information in the article came from an anonymous federal offi - cial involved in the planning of the wall. \"This should be public information,\" the official told the Observer . \"There shouldn't be government officials meet - ing in secret just so they don't have to deal with the backlash.\" Six days later, the center's director, Marianna Trevi\u00f1o Wright, discovered a small crew of men with chainsaws and heavy equipment widening a road on the NBC property. When an alarmed Wright objected, she told me, the crew\u2014from Tikigaq Construction, out of Alaska\u2014put her in touch with a supervisor who said the company had been contracted to do the work by the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection. Wright ordered the men off the property, went back to her office, and threw up. The next day, Jane died. J J J Jane vicroy scott had first been diagnosed with cancer in late 2014. She'd undergone treatment, but the cancer reappeared twice, most recently last fall. Rounds of chemotherapy followed. After a lifetime as a scientist, she was frustrated by the mental fog from the treatment, and she was looking forward to regaining her former sharpness. \"They said it comes back,\" she told me. \"Your neurons start to function again.\" She and Glassberg spent most of their time in New Jersey while she recovered. The hope had been that, this time, the cancer would be finished off and life would return to normal. The weeks that followed Jane's death were chaotic. Glassberg was inconsol - able. Friends and family, including his son from North Carolina, stopped in to check on him, but for an entire week he was essentially out of commission. \"Incapacitated is the best word,\" said NABA vice president Jim Springer, who temporarily took over running the organization. I spoke to Glassberg not long after Jane's death. \"I had no idea such emotional pain was possible,\" he told me. \"It was so much worse than anything I could imagine.\" Adding to the stress was the news out of Texas, where the federal government's plans for a border wall were beginning to emerge. A Freedom of Information Act request by the Sierra Club had led to the release of a map, produced by the Army Corps of Engineers, that showed the wall cutting directly through a number of wildlife refuges, including the NBC. The wall would be sheer concrete, and topped with an eighteen-foot-high bollard fence. The plans also called for an enforcement zone of one hundred fifty feet to be stripped of vegetation, with lighting, cameras, and patrol roads. It's too early to know what will actually happen with the wall, but if a project like that comes to pass, it would likely have a devastating effect on the Rio Grande Valley ecosystem. A 2011 study led by a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin found that in places where a previous border wall already stands, some wildlife had seen more than 75 percent of their range divided by the barrier, increasing the risk of extinction. A wall would likely also exacerbate flooding from the Glassberg at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the National Butterfly Center in 2010.

Some low-flying species might also be deterred by the wall. Then there're the floodlights, the noise, and the steady construction activity, all of it disrupting the natural environ - ment. And don't forget the potential effect on tourism, Glassberg told me. \"The entire butterfly center might be jeopardized if there's a drop in visi - tors,\" he said. \"It couldn't economically survive.\" Last August, hundreds of people gathered in Mission to march in protest of the wall. Father Roy, in a white cas - sock and cowboy hat, led the proces - sion. Glassberg spoke at the event, his first real outing since Jane had passed. Wearing a white NABA polo shirt and his bucket cap, he told the audience about founding the NBC, the ties he'd made in the valley, and how Jane had been there with him throughout its history. \"And just, the butterfly center means an awful lot to me and her,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"I have a stake in it in all kinds of ways.\" I I I In december, four months after the march, I called up Glassberg. He said he was doing better. Watching sports on television was one of the few things that didn't trigger his emotions, he said. He told me that he was suing a number of government agencies to fight the wall project, with the pro bono legal services of the New York firm Debevoise & Plimpton. His lawyers had told him it would likely be this spring before there were any real developments. At NABA and the National Butterfly Center, meanwhile, they'd yet to really transition Jane's COO tasks, so Glassberg and Springer and some of the other board members and former staff were trying to make sense of the spreadsheets and checkbooks. There were taxes to think about, and pay - roll for the National Butterfly Center staffers. Still, a new habitat conservation plan was taking off. NABA was taking the butterfly center's approach to habitat preservation and bringing it to other parts of the country, essentially taking an active role in protect - ing habitats that support endangered butterflies. The initiative had languished during Jane's illness, but now Glassberg was working to get things moving again. NABA was looking into buying land in the Midwest where numer - ous butterflies are imperiled, and Glassberg had plans to visit Florida, where he had contracted with a grower to produce a thousand speci - mens of pineland croton\u2014the critical host plant for the Bartram's scrub hair - streak butterfly. The idea was to place those plants in the yards of homeowners who live near the little hairstreak's van - ishing habitat. Glassberg also had plans for a first step in rescuing a butterfly in eastern Texas called the frosted elfin. At the NBC, too, life was beginning to return to normal. Even with the threat of the wall looming, the center was installing a native wetland feature, and starting a project with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to plant acres of milkweed for migrating monarchs. For his part, Glassberg was trying to be more like Jane. He was tipping his cab drivers a little more, and being more patient with the public. He told me about the time he'd answered the NABA phone, and someone had asked him about a certain kind of caterpil - lar\u2014not his area, he didn't raise them like some NABA members did, but he didn't just shut the conversation down with that. \"I told her to join NABA and join NABA-chat. But I did it in a nice way. And then she had some other questions and I let her know what I knew and didn't,\" he said. \"I gave her my opinion about this or that, and talked about wasps.\" SHANNON FISCHER is a science writer based in Boston.

SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 35 We asked nine Tufts professors to tell us the personal stories behind their elaborate Commencement fashions. PHOTOS AND TEXT BY ANNA MILLER PHOTO DIRECTION BY ALONSO NICHOLS a couple of months from now\u2014 on the morning of May 20, to be exact\u2014faculty from every Tufts campus and academic discipline will gather together in front of Ballou Hall to celebrate Commencement. It will be a day of rejoicing, unity, pride, and tradition\u2014with the occasional dash of fashion thrown into the mix. Graduation attire\u2014the fine robes, black velvet hats, and golden tassels\u2014may be part of a tradition that dates back to the Europe of the Middle Ages, but for some professors academic regalia tells a story, one that reflects their own academic journey, their personal identity and accomplishments. Here, nine Tufts professors share the stories behind what they will be wearing as they pass through the sea of excited graduates and proud parents on Commencement Day. Associate Professor of Political Science Pearl Robinson is shown in the light-blue robe and gold tassels of Columbia University, where she earned her PhD. She has worn them to every Tufts graduation for the past forty years. \"My gown has grown old with me,\" Robinson said. \"It's seen the passage of time. Even the thread has worn out.\" Regale Us SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 37Professor of Music David Locke is photographed in his usual Commencement regalia\u2014the zupiligu (hat), bingma (smock), kurugu (pants), zolugu (necklace), and zuli (whisks) that were given to him by his teacher in Ghana, where Locke lived for two years while studying for his PhD. \"African traditions are sophisticated and beauti - ful,\" Locke said. \"Deep sources of knowledge can be found in parts of the world many Americans might overlook.\" 38 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Shomon Shamsuddin, assistant professor of urban and environmental policy and planning, is shown wearing his regalia from the Massa - chusetts Institute of Technol - ogy. \"On Commencement Day, when you unzip the case that holds the regalia, it's almost like this treasure that emerges for a brief moment and then you have to wait until next year to wear it again.\" SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 39 Professor of Mathematics BORIS HASSELBLAT t Hasselblatt poses here in the family heirloom he wears to every Commencement. \"These are my father's robes,\" said Hasselblatt, whose father was a Lutheran pastor in Germany. \"He passed away twenty years ago, and I've worn them ever since.\" Also on display here are the colorful hood from the California Institute of Technology, where Hasselblatt earned his doctorate, and the Tufts mace, a ceremonial staff that is used during the faculty procession on Commencement Day. Associate Professor of English Modhumita Roy is shown here in her mother's sari and sash, which she wears on Commencement Day. The embroidery pattern is specific to where she grew up in Kolkata, the capital city of the Indian state of West Bengal. Roy, who received her PhD from Stony Brook University, said her regalia reflects both her home country and her time in the States. \"It's a nod to both customs,\" she said. 40 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Professor of Mathematics Boris Hasselblatt poses here in the family heirloom he wears to every Commencement. \"These are my father's robes,\" said Hasselblatt, whose father was a Lutheran pastor in Germany. \"He passed away twenty years ago, and I've worn them ever since.\" Also on display here are the colorful hood from the California Institute of Technology, where Hasselblatt earned his doctorate, and the Tufts mace, a ceremonial staff that is used during the faculty procession on Commencement Day. SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 41 Assistant Professor of Sociology Freeden Blume Oeur, who earned his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley here wears the regalia that his parents, immigrants from Cambodia, purchased for him as a graduation gift. \"I couldn't afford to buy it myself,\" he said. \"Commencement is especially meaningful to the families of first-gen - eration college students,\" said Oeur. He and his sister were the first in their family to go to university.42 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 \"The British love hats!\" said Professor of Economics Lynne Pepall, who earned her own puffy hat, along with a PhD, at the University of Cambridge. The European regalia Pepall wears here was designed in the monastic tradi - tion\u2014\"Harry Potter style,\" she said. The hoods were originally created to keep people's heads and shoulders warm in drafty buildings or bad weather. Her sleeves, meanwhile, also serve as a pocket where she can discreetly store written remarks. Professor Emeritus Anthony \"Tony\" Schwartz is photographed wearing a gray hood and carnelian red robes from Cornell University, where he received his veterinary degree. Schwartz, who served as a professor of surgery and associate dean at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine until he retired in 2005, has attended nearly every graduation since 1979. \"It's a part of me,\" Schwartz said of the school where he's been since the very beginning.SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 43 Associate Professor of Psychology Ayanna Thomas is photographed here wearing the regalia of the University of Washington, where she earned her PhD. Graduation isn't the only time that Thomas throws on her Commencement gear, however. \"I like to wear it sometimes when I'm cold in my office,\" she said. \"The robe is really warm.\" GENIUSREEL in 2006, charles cohen was content. twenty years after taking over Cohen Brothers Realty, the business started by his father and uncles, Cohen, A74, had transformed it into a major player in the world of commercial real estate, with properties such as the Decoration & Design building in New York City and the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, California. He certainly wasn't looking for a new job. But then an attorney asked for help raising two million dollars for a movie: the man's wife, Courtney Hunt, had written her first full-length feature. Cohen ended up kicking in $340,000. The film\u2014 Frozen River , which came out in 2008 and starred Melissa Leo as a single mother who smuggles immigrants across the Canadian border\u2014was soon on whatMeet the real estate magnate who's betting he can get you off your private screens and back into a movie theater BY STUART MILLER, A88 PHOTO BY AUDE DE CAZENOVE 44 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 45 Cohen called \"a trajectory you can't explain,\" garnering rave reviews and for Hunt's screenplay and Leo's acting. Initially, Cohen's mother had asked why he'd invested in an unknown filmmaker. \"It was destiny,\" he'd replied. Today, he believes that, subconsciously, he saw Frozen River not as a one-shot deal but as a first step into a world he'd long dreamed about being part of. Still, Cohen, who has continued his success at Cohen Brothers Realty and is now worth nearly $3 billion, is a pragmatic businessman. For all Frozen River 's critical success, Cohen didn't wind up recouping his invest - ment in the movie\u2014so he created a new business model to develop a range of ways of making money in the film industry. He has branched out beyond film production into film distribution, restoration, licensing, and even film exhibition\u2014buying and renovating iconic brick-and-mortar theaters. \"I want to find a way to create a cultural experience with a community benefit, but to find an economically sustainable model,\" he said. If Cohen's efforts fail to pay off, it won't be from lack of attention to detail. When we met recently at the Cohen Brothers offices, in a confer - ence room overlooking Central Park, he made one last phone call before our interview. On the phone, he insisted that the lettering on an ad for The Insult , a new French-Lebanese film he's distrib - uting in America, be changed from white to black. \"I don't micromanage,\" Cohen, in a crisp striped suit and every hair in place, told me later. \"But I have a strong visual sense that I apply to every - thing I do, and I know what works and what hasn't worked.\" All he really wants is to ensure that everything goes right, he said. \"There's Murphy's Law and Cohen's Law,\" he told me. \"And Cohen's Law is that Murphy was an optimist.\" Weeks later The Insult received an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film, making it the fifth of the foreign films he's distributed to be so hon - ored. Last year The Salesman , an Iranian movie he distributed, won that award. Charles cohen was enchanted by movies long before he focused on dollars and cents. When he was three he visited his grand - mother in Manhattan, where she took him to see the Disney animated feature Cinderella . \"We sat through it twice and I was never the same,\" he said. Growing up in the sub - urb of Harrison, New York, he found that \"film was an exposure to different worlds before I'd really traveled.\" At fourteen, he was reading reviews in Variety . \"I loved seeing a new movie on Friday night, and the trade reviews came out before the newspaper reviews, so I thought, 'Gee, I've got an edge here.'\" In high school, he became a filmmaker himself. His movie Contrast interspersed images of recent race riots in Newark with scenes that told the story of a black kid and a white kid who work together to make a merry-go-round run. Another of his early movies, Recoil , was about someone who buys a shotgun to go hunting but then is accidentally killed by others. Later, in college, he made a Bruce Lee spoof, and after graduation, he went to Brooklyn Law School and envisioned getting into the film industry as an entertainment lawyer. \"But I couldn't get a job in New York and I didn't have the guts to leave New York for Los Angeles,\" he said. What he did have, however, was drive, much like his father and uncle, PHOTO: SCOTT HEINS (BAR) Left: Italian posters like this one for the 1957 drama Witness for the Prosecution enhance the d\u00e9cor of Cohen's newly refurbished Quad Cinema in Manhattan. Right: The Quad Bar, a classy hangout for patrons of the theater. 46 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018who built the family business by buying up land along Third Avenue in Manhattan when an elevated train line was being torn down. By the time Frozen River came along, he also had decades of business experience behind him, and once it was clear that he couldn't reliably make a profit in the film industry through financing alone, he created Cohen Media Group, his own film production and distribution company. Then he began amassing the Cohen Film Collection, which now consists of some eight hundred rare and classic movies, many lovingly restored. It includes almost all of silent film star Buster Keaton's movies and the entire Merchant Ivory catalogue, beloved among film aficionados for treasures like the Oscar-winning adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel Howards End . Taking matters into his own hands in this way has given him plenty of latitude to pursue his ideas, not only as a businessman but as a patron of the arts. He puts his voluminous film col - lection to use by hosting a short-season weekly series called Cohen Film Classics on KCET, an independent television station in Los Angeles. And when he's producing a film, he is involved in every aspect of it, from finding a director to arranging financing. Sometimes he even has a hand in the editing process. When it comes to film distribution, the works he wants are usually foreign films that won't reap huge dollars for his company. But Cohen can often turn a profit with them thanks to, first, bidding conservatively on each film in negotiations with the producing studio, and then licensing the film to cable networks and streaming outlets like Amazon or Netflix. He also benefits from DVD sales of the film. In some ways, Cohen's approach resembles that of Netflix, which started as a DVD rental service, added stream - ing, and then surprised people by producing its own content. But unlike Netflix, which has always catered to mainstream tastes, Cohen serves more of a niche market. And all of that makes him a seeming contradiction in terms: an art-house movie mogul. \"He's a counterpoint to much of the indie film world,\" said Chris Wells, the director of repertory program - ming at Manhattan's historic Quad Cinema, which Cohen renovated and reopened last year. \"He really sees the big picture.\" Cohen, whose private twenty-four-seat theater in his Connecticut home is modeled after the old Paramount in Times Square, believes that part of that big picture is reviving the thrill of a night out at the movies. True, movie ticket sales have been sliding\u2014down to 1.31 billion in 2016 from 1.57 billion in 2002\u2014but he's betting that there are still cinephiles out there, and that he can lure them away from their home theaters. \"People want a community experience and filmmakers want their work to be enjoyed as a community,\" he said. So he's committed to a theatri - cal release for each of his films, and that's why he's buying and renovating theaters: he can't always count on other people's venues to screen the rare, foreign, and indie films he values so highly. He's started with the Quad, which now includes state-of-the-art sound and projection, and a bar styled like a classic Greenwich Village hangout. The theater's d\u00e9cor features vintage Italian movie posters from his private collection. All the effort seems to be paying off: even during the week of last winter's infamous \"bomb cyclone,\" as gale-force winds and drifting snow besieged Manhattan, the Quad was full. That Wednesday saw a sold-out sneak preview of the first film by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei\u2014Meryl Streep made a surprise appearance to introduce it. The next night, the Quad Bar filled up with an enthusiastic LGBT crowd for the latest installment in the theater's \"Coming Out Again\" series. Cohen's future plans include refur - bishing historic theaters that he has bought in Paris, West Palm Beach, and Larchmont, New York. He also intends to roll out his own on-demand movie service, expand his library (\"buying whatever isn't nailed down\"), and revive the brand of the iconic movie company Merchant Ivory, even making new films under that banner. As for new releases, he's producing a feature based on the World War II saga Operation Mincemeat and a documentary about the cele - brated mime Marcel Marceau. He also wants to use his Buster Keaton rights to produce a biopic of the film legend. And Cohen Brothers Realty? Today it holds more than twelve million square feet of office buildings and design centers nationwide, including 3 Park Avenue, Grand Central Plaza, and International Plaza in New York. But prestige addresses no longer appear to be the most buzzworthy thing about Cohen. \"Now when I deal with real estate people,\" he told me, \"all they want to do is talk about this movie stuff.\" STUART MILLER, A88, is a journalist living in Brooklyn. The Insult (2017) earned Cohen his latest Oscar nomination, Frozen River (2008) his first. The Salesman (2016) won him the coveted award.

At Harvard that year, 87 percent of legacy applicants\u2014the children or grandchildren of alumni\u2014were accepted. At Yale and Princeton, the numbers were even greater. Here on the Hill, mean - while, you would have been hard-pressed, when looking at a formal photo of a Tufts faculty meeting, to find anyone who didn't shave. The faculty of Liberal Arts and Engineering, like most of American higher education, was overwhelmingly male, white, Protestant, and satis - fied. Departmental hiring excluded candidates who were \"different.\" When, for instance, a newly minted female Harvard PhD wrote to the chairman of the English department, inquiring about an advertised position, she received the following reply: \"Dear Miss Hennessey: For more than half a century now, the Ex College has been challenging convention, setting trends, and preparing students for the world of tomorrow.

The Tufts English Department does not hire women. Yours truly, Harold Blanchard, Chairman.\" Helen Hennessey\u2014Helen Vendler after she married\u2014kept the letter as she went on to become argu - ably the most renowned literary critic of poetry this country ever produced. She received a Tufts honorary degree in 2001. In a thirteen-year presidency, Nils Wessel did all he could to transform Tufts by ushering it into the modern age. Admissions quotas were ended. The English department hired its first Catholic and Jew: two academic anarchists named Bernard McCabe and Michael Fixler. The history department hired its first non-Protestant, George Marcopoulos, a Greek Orthodox. Wessel also saved from extinction two unwanted departments made up pre - dominantly of women faculty and gave them a permanent home in Arts and Sciences: Eliot-Pearson and occupational therapy. And he had one more gift: in 1963, he pushed forward the idea of \"an experimental college,\" a place where faculty and students could engage in independent and creative thinking, test out ideas, and learn outside the restric - tive box of academic tradition. \"The Experimental College was the most important thing I did at Tufts,\" Wessel said, looking back thirty years later. Wessel was ahead of his time. As his tenure at Tufts began winding down, the academic world was still slumbering quietly. The civil rights protests, begun in 1955 when Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back of a Montgomery, Alabama, bus, caused barely a ripple on college campuses. And there were no student protests about policies at the post-war hous - ing development Levittown, on Long Island, that prohibited the re-sale of units to \"Negroes.\" Here at Tufts, the women's dorms had no Coke machines, because the dean of women said the soft drink was bad for the teeth of females. The student draft registration was calmly accepted. Fourteen south - ern states still had legislation that made marriage between people of different races illegal. But Wessel sniffed something in the air. In 1962, a University of Michigan student named Tom Hayden wrote the Port Huron Declaration, announcing an organization called the Students for a Democratic Society that was dedicated to the transformation of American democracy. Wessel knew, even if few others on campus did, that change was coming, and he intended to position Tufts to be prepared to deal with it. That is what led to the brand new Experimental College: non-traditional subjects and faculty, smaller classes, and full credit toward Commencement. The Ex College opened its doors for business in September 1964 with an overriding mission: empowerment to students. The Ex College voted to have three students participate in all decisions, then added a fourth the next year, and gave all of them full voting powers, a first not just for Tufts, but for most colleges and uni - versities in the country. In that year, the University of California Berkeley cam - pus erupted in angry demonstrations when students demanded a voice in governance; what they got were arrests. The Ex College faculty/student board had two goals in that first year: all students would be teachers, and all teachers would be students; and students would discover the knowl - edge necessary for the world that was coming. The first faculty-led Ex College classes seem innocent enough today, but at the time it was revolutionary to be teaching modern European litera - ture of the absurd, in English transla - tion led by team-teaching faculty from three different departments. And that was just the beginning. Within three years, freshman seminars were being offered by student and faculty board members on topics ranging from urban poverty, race, and gender to sexuality and community involvement. In 1968, when senior board member Tom Glynn suggested that the people in the com - munities knew more about their lives than most faculty, Joanne Ross, a high school graduate who had spent thirteen years on welfare, became the first visiting lecturer at the Experimental College, teaching a course on urban poverty that left the undergraduates calling for more. Community activ - ist James Vance, meanwhile, had to repeatedly offer his race awareness course because of student demand. The late 1960s was a tough time on American and European campuses, and Tufts didn't escape the disruptions of the civil rights conflict, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of two Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr. We had our share of building occupations and confrontations. But somehow there was We had our share of building occupations and confrontations. But somehow there was always an extra measure of civility and communication, because the Ex College was always there to offer a symposium, a conference, or some other means of getting people together to talk.always an extra measure of civility and communication, because the Ex College was always there to offer a symposium, a conference, or some other means of getting people together to talk. As Tufts continued to change and evolve, however, it was getting more difficult to find faculty who were willing and able to make time for the commit - ment to the Ex College. Research and publication were growing in impor - tance, and many young faculty were advised by their older colleagues to stay away from the Ex College because it was too time-consuming. Dean Bernie Harleston recognized that even with its courses, visiting lecturers, student engagement, and hundreds of enroll - ments, the Ex College was in danger of collapse because of its lack of staff. So Harleston made a critical decision. He authorized two part-time \"co-ordina - tors.\" In 1971, those roles were filled by Margaret Ritchie and Robyn Gittleman (the wife of the author of this article), who together brought organizational stability. When Ritchie left in 1975, Gittleman was appointed full-time director. At last the Experimental College had someone who could deal with crises, act as godmother, and soothe anxious faculty nerves. In 1979, Arts and Sciences voted permanent sta - tus for the Experimental College. It had gained \"respectability,\" but it preferred to keep pushing the envelope. As the years passed, the Ex College further devel - oped its way of antici - pating what was missing from the traditional curriculum, its openness to new ideas, and its willingness to fail. Risk was never far away, but always taken with understanding that student interest was often ahead of faculty response. For example, when students in the early 1980s demanded courses related to the mass media, the Experimental College found professionals in the community who could provide unique experiences while not losing sight of a liberal arts education. In this way, communica - tions and media studies was born in 1982. That same year produced the Ex College peace and justice program, with the active involvement of faculty from sociology and political science because it was too interdisciplinary for any one department. The Ex College, in other words, always had a home for orphans, until someone adopted them. Some orphans stayed for longer than others. In 1985, the Ex College student board members Eric Siegel, Lisa Fair, and John Barrengos challenged the fac - ulty to create a more intellectually seri - ous campus environment. They wanted controversial topics, in-depth analysis, outside experts, and intense prepara - tion. They wanted what would eventu - ally become the Symposium Project. The idea was to create a semester-long course that entrusted the students to take ownership of every aspect, and that culminated in a weekend-long symposium. It sounded like a great idea, but one that would require just the right kind of leadership. The orga - nizers found a not-quite-traditional freelance academic outsider named Sherman Teichman who was waiting for just such a chance. The Ex College took a risk, gave Teichman a home, and gave full academic credit for student participation. Far ahead of anyone else, the Symposium Project engaged in topics such as the West Bank and Gaza Strip (1987), covert action and democ - racy (1988), and drugs, international security, and US public policy (1989). Over time the Symposium Project evolved into EPIIC, and then into the Tufts Institute for Global Leadership. Through it all, for more than thirty years, it has been a global-oriented, in-your-face conversation that draws in opinionated participants from all over the world and from every Tufts professional school. The Tufts Experimental College was part of a movement of such programs across the nation that burst out in a wave of late-1960s reaction to cam - pus change. Today that wave is gone. Once there were dozens of Ex Colleges; today, Oberlin College is the only other one that maintains enough interest to continue with the name, but it has no faculty and little administrative involve - ment. There are two or three other \"experimental colleges\" across the coun - try, isolated on their campuses: empty shells. The Tufts Ex College, however, continues to thrive. In 2016 Gittleman made way for Howard Woolf, the second director (and true believer) in the Ex College's history. Nearly sixty years ago, a Tufts president's intuition foresaw a student revolution that would require the con - stant reinvention of the undergraduate curriculum and the need for a creative mechanism to assure a new kind of student involvement. To this day, the Ex College serves to remind the Tufts community that in the DNA of our university is Nils Wessel's idea of a student-centered college education.

He asked if I would draw during his group's performance at a concert bene - fiting stray dogs. We spent the afternoon scrounging up the materials, then I sat up front with a sketch pad and did eight or nine.

The fund is the first of its kind to sup - port the Roadshow, which sends student entrepreneurs to New York City, Palo Alto, and San Francisco to pitch their ideas to Tufts alumni and investors. \"These kinds of ventures are necessary and useful for emerging entrepreneurs,\" Baquerizo said. \"What better way to give back to Tufts?\" Like many students, Baquerizo made decisions at Tufts that shaped his professional life. Having arrived on campus with little interest in engineering, he decided to major in the field midway through his first year. \"Looking back now, I can't believe I didn't consider engineering from the start,\" he said. \"The engineering program gave me skills and mental openness I use every day in my business.\" That business is A&B, a real estate development company that builds new cities from the ground up. As the company's cofounder and execu - tive director, Baquerizo has developed more than forty thousand housing units in Ecuador and Peru. After a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2016 devastated entire cities, he brought together members of the Chamber of Housing Developers of Ecuador to provide pro bono urban planning services in three of the hardest-hit areas. The group also donated 150 new homes for families whose homes were destroyed in the disaster. Baquerizo considers the Rodolfo Baquerizo Fund for Entrepreneurship a way of supporting the university that helped shape his career. \"I feel like I have accountability to give back a little bit of what I have gained through my education so that other kids can bene - fit, and someday they will also give back,\" he said.DAY 5 I visit the catacombs of San Gennaro. Once covered by mosaics that filled the walls and vaulted ceilings, only traces remain. Later, I look out my window toward Sorrento and see the long traces drawn by pilots as they arc toward the dock or head out to sea. When I first came here, my view of the bay was much closer to the water, a balcony on Via Partenope. Up here, from Capodimonte, it's a long view. The patterns are clearer at a distance. DAY 6 I wander through the Sanit\u00e1 neighborhood as far as the Cimitero delle Fontanelle, marveling at the shrines you often find on the walls of homes and shops, next to the door. Celebrating a family member or shop's founder, some of these shrines are extremely elaborate\u2014closed in, lighted, padlocked, with paintings and statues. Others are little more than a hole in the wall with a tiny figure and a flower. DAY 7 I am invited to attend a workshop on making prese - pes, or nativity scenes. This art form is so significant in the city that entire sections of Naples are said to resemble it, and are even called \"the presepe.\" I meet Ezio Esposito, a renowned maker of presepe scenes. Ezio shows me his work, both in his home and at a church that's being restored in the Materdei district. SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 53 54 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 ConnectWHEN RADIOLOGIST RICHARD Frates, M55, spoke at conferences, he reveled in producing X-rays that revealed answers to tough medical questions, says his daughter, Mary C. Frates, M.D., who followed him into radiology. A dedicated physician and lifelong learner who died in 2014, Richard did his advanced training in pediatrics and interven - tional radiology at Tufts-New England Medical Center and went on to create the state's first interventional radiology suite at Rhode Island Hospital. He headed that unit for 20 years before becoming Chief of Radiology at the Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, retiring in 1998. Fellowships Honor Families and Faculty Physicians Ashvin Patel, A84, M88, and Mary Frates found the perfect opportunity to honor those who inspired their careers through establishing student research fellowships at the School of Medicine. Mary did a two-week rotation in the department he created at Rhode Island Hospital, which led to a Radiology res - idency at Tufts-New England Medical Center followed by fellowship training at Brigham and Women's and a career in Ultrasound at the Brigham. Her father would attend her lectures and send up questions through the modera - tor, she says. After Richard passed away, Mary and her family, including Mary's siblings Richard Frates Jr., M86, a pediatrician, and Patricia Noone, J85, decided to use their inheritance to honor his love of learning and med - icine by establishing the Richard E. Frates, M.D., M55, Fellowship to sup - port medical students who want to do summer research. \"The answers today are going to come out of the labs,\" says Mary, now the Assistant Director of Ultrasound at Brigham and Women's Richard Frates above and Ashvin Patel with his parents at left.Hospital. \"We have to encourage med students so those who are inclined to do research have the support they need.\" When he arrived in the United States at age 11, Ashvin Patel, A84, M88, didn't speak English. His parents insisted that should not be a barrier to dreaming big. \"They said you should always try to reach for something you think you may not be able to get,\" says Patel, who has established several fellowships at Tufts. In that spirit, Patel applied and was accepted to the undergraduate program at Tufts University, where he earned a B.S. in biology. He went on to graduate from the School of Medicine in 1988. When he did his residency at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, one field in particular caught his interest, offering constant challenges and immediate results: spine surgery. Now a successful spine surgeon in Sarasota, Florida, Patel has established the Dr. and Mrs. Ishvarbhai S. Patel Fellowship for M.D. students pursu - ing orthopedic research. He did it to honor his parents, whose financial support and faith in him made his career possible. Patel also created the Toby Wesselhoeft, M.D., Fellowship for students pursuing family medicine research, in memory of the big-hearted Tufts professor who inspired him to go into orthopedics. \"I hope [these fellowships] will help a student better define their career goals and have the opportunity to do all the things I'm able to do now,\" Patel says. Dean of Students Amy Kuhlik says fellowships like the ones Ashvin Patel and Mary Frates have established foster close relationships with faculty, connect classroom concepts to real life, and provide an important credential for residency applications. \"We know the students' experiences have a lasting impact,\" she says.WHY I GIVE Lumay Wang, A11 Wang has given to the Tufts Fund every year since graduating. She also started the Washington, D.C., chapter of Young Friends of Tufts Advancement. An international relations and art history major, Wang expanded her horizons at Tufts, studying abroad in Paris and doing research in Shanghai. It was also at Tufts that Wang met her future fianc\u00e9, and developed the love of running that still carries her through long-distance races and triathlons. WHY SHE GIVES Tufts gave a lot to me so it's important to not only give back, but also pay it forward for future generations of students. I really owe it to the department and the professors who shaped my thinking and decision-making, and I want to support them so they can continue to help students pursue their dreams. A COMMITMENT TO SERVICE I'm very grateful to my parents. My dad was a diplomat for a long time, and my mom worked in international development and international rule of law. I was inspired by them at a young age to believe there's a greater purpose for an individual in society to make it better. If you have the chance, the privilege, and the means, it's your responsibility. A LIGHT FOR OTHERS I came to Tufts because of the emphasis on citizenship, and the opportunities to travel and study abroad. It was the light on the hill, and it seemed like a place where one could also begin to be a light for others. BRIGHT MEMORIES My best memory of Tufts is the day I met my fianc\u00e9. I had just agreed to join Discourse , a student-run magazine that he had started. He was a senior and he was full of confidence, and when he walked into the conference room on the third floor of the Institute for Global Leadership, I immediately fell in love with him.

As an active member of the First Church of Christ Scientist in Cambridge, In Memoriam SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 59 60 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Connect PHOTO: BETHANY VERSOYFORMER TRUSTEES CHAIR NELSON GIFFORD DIES Serving on the Board of Trustees from 1978 to 1995, he helped lead the transformation of Tufts. BY LAURA FERGUSON NELSON GIFFORD, A52, H96, a former chair of the Board of Trustees who championed a bold strategic vision for Tufts, died December 20. He was eighty-seven. A straight-talking and successful businessman, Gifford merged a gift for leadership with an abiding passion for civic engagement. At Tufts, his personal benchmark was often quoted: \"Did I just serve or did I make a difference?\" It has enduring resonance for those who remember his service on the Board of Trustees from 1978 to 1995, the last eleven years as chairman. Gifford \"made a profound difference as his dreams for Tufts aligned with those of that irrepressible entrepreneur, former President Jean Mayer,\" said Steven S. Manos, H08, former executive vice president at Tufts. \"A striver, Nelson had worked to pay his tuition, and he continued to like those who yanked on their own bootstraps his whole life. He joined Jean in his belief that Tufts could be a dramatically different institution, the one we know today. And he supported that vision, leavening dreams with fiscal prudence.\" Gifford helped keep Mayer as president after the board voted not to renew his contract, said Sol Gittleman, who was provost from 1981 to 2002. \"Without Nelson's leadership, Tufts would be a vastly different place now\u2014if we had survived at all,\" he said. \"As board finance chairman and then as board chairman, Gifford allowed a creative but risk-taking Tufts president to do his thing. Nelson stayed behind the curtain, but he made it all happen, and Tufts owes him our deepest gratitude.\" Gifford's legacy on the board \"was marked by a number of innovations, a result of thirty-five years of expertise in the management of organizations in the business and nonprofit sector,\" noted a citation in 1996, when Tufts awarded Gifford an honorary doctor of business administration degree. During his tenure, he was instrumental in raising funds from the board for the completion of Tisch Library, and he introduced modern financial systems and budgeting procedures. He was a driving force behind the university's first large- scale fundraising efforts, which brought in a record-breaking $145 million, $250 million, and $609 million, respectively. These campaigns helped Tufts create veterinary and nutrition schools and attain world-class status under Mayer's leadership, said Gittleman. He donated to Tisch Library, financial aid, scholarships including the Class of 1952's Centennial Scholarship, and for many years, an annual fund gift equal to the tuition for one undergraduate year. Recognizing the sym - bolic and practical role of the president's residence in the life of the university, Gifford also underwrote significant improve - ments to the 1938 Georgian residence on the Medford/Somerville campus. It was renamed Gifford House in his honor in May 1996. Born in 1930, Gifford grew up in Waban, Massachusetts. He paid his Tufts tuition with a series of jobs, including delivering milk and selling flower seeds up and down the East Coast during the summer. A varsity swimmer and varsity lacrosse team player, he graduated with a degree in economics, and went on to serve a tour of active duty in the US Navy as an officer during the Korean War. In 1954, Gifford joined Framingham-based Dennison Manufacturing Company (later Avery Dennison) as an entry-level accounting clerk. He rose through the ranks to become president in 1972, chief executive officer in 1975, and chair - man in 1985. He led the company until its merger with Avery International in 1990. He is credited with leading the transfor - mation of a nineteenth-century brick-and-mortar manufac - turing company of stationery and office supplies into a Fortune 500 global enterprise thriving in twenty-plus countries. Dedicated to active public service, Gifford also served on the boards of the Bank of Boston, Boston Edison, John Hancock Life Insurance, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He was a past chairman of the Massachusetts Business Round Table. In 1985 he was appointed by Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis to chair the Governor's Health Care Task Force. Gifford's philanthropy extended widely, including support for such institutions as the Pine Street Inn, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, McLean Hospital, and the Joslin Diabetes Clinic. Gifford was married to the late Elizabeth (Brow) Gifford for fifty years, and maintained a summer home in Marion, Massachusetts, where he was a member of the Beverly Yacht Club. An avid and consummate sailor, he loved long spells cruising, venturing from Nova Scotia to the Florida Keys. MA, she was guided by a strong faith and love of God. As a member of the League of Women Voters, she participated in town politics as well. But above all, she was a loving mother and grandmother. MARTIN R. SANTIS, A58, M62 , in Acton, MA. He practiced internal medicine and endocrinology in Concord, MA, for thirty-one years. He leaves his wife, Helen Santis; his children, David (and wife Kathi), Susan (and husband Brett Neal), and Elizabeth; and his grandchil - dren, Emily and Alexandra Santis and Jessica and Zachary Neal. 1960s HENRY M. DEMARCO, A60, D63 , on January 10, 2018. He served in the US Navy as a dentist at the naval submarine base in New London, CT, before starting a dental practice in Somerset, MA, that operated for thirty-six years. He retired in 2001. He enjoyed going to the beach with his wife, Joan; traveling, golfing, and skiing; quahogging with his granddaughter; and being with his family and friends. He is survived by his wife of twenty-five years, Joan (Potts) DeMarco; his daughter, Deanne M. Midwood, and her hus - band, Michael; his granddaughter, Allie J. Midwood; his sister, Patricia Dorrell; several nieces and nephews; two stepdaughters; three stepsons; and a number of step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren. He was also the husband of the late Jeanne (Monastess) DeMarco; father of the late Daniel and Douglas Demarco; and brother of the late Beverly DeMarco. EARLE B. HOYT, AG66 , on May 15, 2017.

Wechsler had a career as a board-certified general surgeon, the first in Lakewood, New Jersey, and was on staff at Paul Kimball Hospital, CentraState Medical Center (formerly Freehold Hospital), and Jersey Shore. He was a man of habit\u2014working long hours, coming home for family dinner, and then falling asleep while watching the news, newspaper in hand and a glass of Johnnie Walker nearby. He brought gastric bypass surgery to the area in 1980. Later in his career, Wechsler elected to focus his work on general breast surgery, which afforded him more regular hours and more time with his family. Wechsler was known as a skilled, kind, and patient physician by his fellow doctors, nurses, and patients. He retired begrudgingly at the age of seventy-four. He never forgot how to be a doctor, making sure his own doctors, nurses, and family always knew who was really in charge. Wechsler never quite learned to cook in his retirement, but the way he prepared his breakfast each day, you would've thought he was a master chef. He did learn to do dishes, much to the delight of his family. He was living proof that an old dog can learn at least one new trick. Wechsler loved to read, especially history, war, and Louis L'Amour books, and his daily Wall Street Journal . He was an avid follower of the stock market. Wechsler loved to ski, taking his family out to the Rockies whenever and as long as he could. Many family memories were created on these trips. Wechsler loved to play tennis, and joined Hollywood Country Club in 1987. While a member, he never did quite become the golf master he had hoped to be. Wechsler was a man of quiet wisdom, strength, pragmatism, and grace, which he passed on to everyone who was fortunate enough to know and love him. He valued and treated everyone he met equally. He always said, \"Never judge someone else until you've walked in their moccasins.\" He lived with no regrets, always believing that \"you live every day like it's your last, because one day you might be right.\" He was a rock who helped many survive whatever storms came their way, and he will be deeply missed by those who knew and loved him. Wechsler is survived by his devoted wife of fifty-six years, Helene; their children, Lee, Gregg, and Dale; and their spouses, Nancy Wechsler and John McCarthy. He took the most pleasure in time spent with his grandchildren, Jamie, Ashley, Aaron, Rachel, and Jared. He was predeceased by his parents, Rebecca and David Wechsler, and his brother, Bernard Wechsler. SPRING 2018 | TUFTS MAGAZINE 61 62 TUFTS MAGAZINE | SPRING 2018 Connectlove with organic chemistry. Both Layer and chemistry stayed with Hoyt for the rest of his life. After Middlebury, Hoyt and Layer lived in Paris, where she was a Fulbright Scholar and he took courses at the Sorbonne and the Alliance Francaise. Later, they went to Tufts, where he pursued a PhD in chemistry. Hoyt's academic career eventually took him to Princeton, where he became interested in theoretical organic chemistry. This led him to establish the program in computational chemistry at Northern Arizona University. At the time of his death, he was a profes - sor of chemistry emeritus who kept in touch with many of his students. He is survived by Layer, his wife of fifty-eight years, and their son, daughter, and two grandchildren, as well as his sister and his beloved labradoodle, Chip. Hoyt rode over a hundred thousand miles on his bike, and rowed over ten thousand miles. Even at age seventy-nine, he remained intellectually curious. In his retirement, he took up pho - tography and enjoyed traveling to Yellowstone. DR. JOHN NEVIN CARSON III, A68 , on June 10, 2017, of biliary duct cancer. Carson was a devoted son, brother, husband, father, and grandfather. He was a proud Tufts alumnus. After earning his degree from Thomas Jefferson Medical College, he spent his forty-year career as director of nephrology for the York Hospital in York, PA. He also introduced dialysis to Adams County, PA, where he became the director of nephrology at two local hospitals. He was beloved by his patients and family. 1970s JOHN E. LEDDEN, A71 , of Wilmington, DE, on November 9, 2017, at age sixty-eight. He graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University.

Ledden had varied interests, includ - ing astronomy, genealogy, music, and philately. He is survived by his brother, his sister, and his nieces. 1980s JUDY BYCK, J83 , passed away peacefully surrounded by her family on July 12, 2017, in her home in Durham, NC, at the age of fifty-five. She was born on May 7, 1962, in Montreal, Quebec, and practiced as a psychotherapist in Durham for twenty-seven years. She is survived by her husband of twenty-eight years, ERIC MLYN, A83 ; her parents, Achille and Rachel Byck; and her sisters, Sarah Byck and Susan Byck.

JOANNE BADER MITCHELL, J81, of Gibson Island, MD, died September 10, 2017, at fifty-seven after a lengthy battle with breast cancer. She was a physician, a Relief Society president, a leader in the primary children's orga - nization in her church, a youth Sunday School teacher, and a visiting teacher. She was also a great listener, loyal friend, scuba diver, sailor, one-time surfer, hiker, tennis and racquetball player, and lap swimmer. Born in Far Rockaway, NY, she graduated from Port Jefferson High School at the top of her class, and took a year off to work in medical labs and as a phlebotomist before attending Stony Brook Medical School, where she met Jeff, her future husband. She joined a medical practice in Glen Burnie, MD, then opened a solo practice in Pasadena, CA, delivering thousands of babies, including one mother, daughter, and granddaughter. She eventually quit obstetrics and focused on gynecologic surgery and diagno - sis and treatment, growing her practice to thousands of patients. She survived a mastectomy and two breast reconstructions and retired, but then emerged from retirement to work part-time. She eventually merged her practice with the Women's Medical Group at University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, where she received treatment herself. She made gifts for friends, played guitar and ukulele, sang, and joined her neighborhood Bible study, knitting groups, and the garden club, and planted a Zelkova tree near the site in the Salt Lake City Cemetery that she selected with Jeff after receiving her diag - nosis. She and her family traveled to Israel and Hawaii. She is missed by her parents, Frank and Nancy Bader; her husband, Jeff Mitchell; her daughters, Em Mitchells and Ariel (with husband Taylor) Williams; her grandson, Theodore; her brother, Richard Bader; her sister, Toni (with husband Claude) Goodman and Eve (with husband Reed) Stockdale; brothers-in-law Jon (with wife Sharmyn) Mitchell; and Steven (with wife Sharyl) Mitchell; and her sixteen nieces and nephews: Daniel, Krystina, Jonathan, David, Michael, Jennifer, Sarah, Max, Liam, Hannah, Sam, Mathew, Joshua, Michael, Michelle, and Jake.

BY COURTNEY HOLLANDS THE SUMMER GEORGIA Tuttle, M80, was six years old, she lived on the campus of Virginia's Madison College with her mother, who was working toward a degree. One Sunday afternoon, Tuttle and her friend were pretending to be Superman. Towels pinned to their shirts, the pair \"flew\" into an open door at the biology building. \"A very nice graduate student or young professor found us in the anatomy room looking at jars of fetuses and skeletons,\" Tuttle recalled. \"He took us on a tour and I remember everything he showed us\u2014I had a burning interest in human anatomy, biology, and medicine.\" That serendipitous trespass helped spur Tuttle to enroll at Tufts University School of Medicine and later go into private dermatology prac - tice in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Active on numerous American Medical Association councils and committees over the years, Tuttle was also the first woman elected president of the New Hampshire Medical Society in 1999. But her public service didn't stop there. She was also mayor of Lebanon for eight straight terms, stepping down last year. We caught up with the doctor-politician to talk life, work, and the call to serve. How does a dermatologist wind up in politics? Two things happened: First, the zoning ordinance in our commu - nity hadn't been updated in seventeen years. I attended hearings on some of the proposed zoning changes to manage the growth of our community\u2014we were overrun by haphazard development and trying to rein it in. At the time, I was also listening to John Adams by David McCullough. I reached the part where Adams had signed the Declaration of Independence and he and his son were sailing across the North Atlantic in winter. If caught, he'd be hung for treason. As I listened to the story, I thought, What have I done for my country? Did being a doctor affect the way you approached government work? Someone trained in science, math, and medicine can look at a complex problem, break it into small components, and work through it in a logical way looking at alternatives. That's why it's so important to learn math and science in school. You don't have to major in any of those fields, but the training you get in the STEM curriculum teaches you to think logically. And did being a politician affect the way you practiced medicine? Sometimes, we don't realize exactly what our patients are going through\u2014but I would hear testimony in my chamber from people who couldn't pay taxes or sewer increases, and it opened my eyes to a different way of thinking about the challenges people are facing. I became even more empathetic to their struggles. New Hampshire is famously home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Is it a good place to be a politician? Over the years, I've met every pres - idential candidate at least twice. I stood next to John McCain and got his autograph. I saw the Bushes, the Clintons, and Obama. In 2016, the presidential candidates were trapped down in southern New Hampshire and didn't come up to the North Country as much because of the dynamics of the election. Generally, I get to listen to each one in a small group so I can really see what kind of people they are. I think that's partly what kept me excited about the political process in our country.
