Cozzo (Under the direction of Brent Berlin) ABSTRACT The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indi ans live in one of the planet's most floristically diverse temperate zone environment s. Their relationship with the local flora was initially investigated by James Mooney and revisited by subsequent researchers such as Frans Olbrechts, John Witthoft, and William Banks, among others. This work interprets the collective data recorded by Cherokee ethnographers, much of it in the form of unpublished archival material, as it reflects the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system and their medical ethnobotany. Mooney's proposed classification system for the Cherokee is remarkably similar to contemporary models of folk biological cla ssification systems. His recognition of this inherent system, 60 years before contempor ary models were proposed, provides evidence for their universality in human cognition. Examination of the collective data concerning Cherokee medical ethnobotany provides a basis for considering change in Cherokee ethnobotanical knowledge, for re- evaluation of the statements of the various researchers, and a means to explore trends that were not previously apparent.

A complete study of Cherokee ethnobotany would be a monumental, multifaceted task, so in this present work I have chosen to concentrate on just two aspects: the ethnobotanical classification system and medical ethnobotany of the Cherokee. The fo rmer, until recently (Cozzo 2000), has not been explored and the latter, while partially described in several works (Mooney 1891, 1900, Mooney and Olbrechts 1932, Banks 1953), has not been treated in a comprehensive manner. As the field of ethnobotany has matu red and been embraced by professional anthropologists, theoretical and methodologica l approaches have also matured. Mere lists of economically useful plants have been shown to be inadequate in explaining the human relationship to their botanical environment. The functional, social, and ideological context must all be considered when taking a holistic approach to plant/human interactions. Conklin's study of the Hanun\u00f3o ethnobotanical classification system is considered a seminal work in the stru cture of cognition as it relates to the field of ethnobotany (Ford 1978), but it was Berl in and his collaborators that demonstrated the universality of folk systems (Berlin 1972, Berlin et al. 1973, Berlin 1992). 2 As the field of ethnobotany has matu red and been embraced by professional anthropologists, theoretical and methodologica l approaches have also matured. Mere lists of economically useful plants have been shown to be inadequate in explaining the human relationship to their botanical environment. The functional, social, and ideological context must all be considered when taking a holistic approach to plant/human interactions. Conklin's study of the Hanun\u00f3o ethnobotanical classification system demonstrated that the stru cture of cognition was also an integral part of the field (Ford 1978). The Cherokee myth of the origin of disease and medicine demonstrates why the Cherokee ethnobotanical system provides an ideal opportunity to integrate their ethnobiological classification system and their medical ethnobotany. In Mooney's version of the myth, all the plants, \"Each Tree, Shrub, and Herb, down to the Grasses and Mosses, agreed to furnish a cure for some one of the diseases named and each said: 'I shall appear to help Man when he calls upon me in his need (1891: 252).'\" Every plant was considered to have a medicinal appl ication, \"even the weeds\", but the means to use each was not always understood by humans. Clearly, as the Cherokees assumed that all plants had a medicinal val ue, whether known or unknown, the system is truly holistic. The segregation of the plant s into the various life forms also delineates the basis of the classification system. But this myth was recorded over 100 years ago and the belief system that fostered it has gone through numerous changes. A compilation such as that described below is limited to the information that has been recorded by previous researchers, which is inherently bounded by the strictures of 3 fieldwork and the awe-inspiring task of comp rehensively recording the complexities of human culture. Contemporary ethnobotany is a multid isciplinary field encompassing or integrated with such diverse disciplines as ethnoecology, ethnomedicine, cognitive ethnobotany, paleoethnobotany, traditional agricultura l practices, and studies of material culture (Cotton 1996: 17). However, as traditi onal cultures are disappearing, there is a growing interest in historical ethnobotany . In the past, historical ethnobotanists have mainly been concerned with the relationship between people and plants as recorded in ancient texts and the pictographs of preliter ate societies (Schultes and von Reis 1995: 89). However, as the discipline has evol ved and methodologies have improved, it is advantageous from both practical and cultural perspectives to revisit the historical records of the ethnographers from the early da ys of the profession. This is especially relevant in North America, where most of the early ethnographic material was gathered by salvage ethnographers bent on compiling as mu ch information as possible before the demise of the native populations, languages, and cu ltures. The bulk of this material was collected by the Bureau of American Ethnology. The Bureau of Ethnology (later to become the Bureau of American Ethnology) was created as a division of the Smithsonian In stitution in 1879. Under the direction of John Wesley Powell, the goal of the Bureau wa s to collect data on Native Americans in the categories of the arts, language, technol ogy, beliefs, and institutions (Moses 1984: 7). Powell had been greatly influenced by Lewis Henry Morgan's evolutionary perspective on the stages of human development and wanted to collect enough empirical data to establish a basis for the science of anthropology, much as Darwin had 4 done for biology. However, Powell perceived the importance of the new ethnology as being not so much the gathering of materials on individual societies, but as a means to reconstruct the lines of mental development and cultural evolution inherent in the various stages of Morgan's model of so cial development (Hinsley 1981: 136-8). Powell's authoritarian styl e of management and strict adherence to his version of cultural evolution often put him at odds with his ethnologists, and he was prone to correct staff member holding what he perce ived as wayward notions (Hinsley 1981: 212). One of these was James Mooney, at the time a young, Irish-Catholic newspaperman from the Midwest with a passion for studying Native Americans. Mooney had gained Powell's attention by hi s compilation of a list of two thousand Indian tribes of North and South America along wi th their linguistic affinities, histories, and tribal relations. Powell was so impress ed that he offered Mooney a paid position the following year if he would volunteer his se rvices until the next fiscal appropriations. Mooney became a full time ethnographer in August of 1886 (Moses 1984: 20). In the spring of 1887, he began his first field a ssignment among the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. Mooney considered the Cherokee to be one of the most important tribes in North America, and the Eastern Band, due to t heir relative isolation, to be \"the purest- blooded and most conservative of the nation (Moses 1982: 22).\" The Eastern Band of the Cherokee was formed by approximately 1,000 of the more conservative members of the Cherokee Nation who evaded the forced removal of 1838. At its peak, the Cherokee Nation's sphere of influence included the entire Southern Appalachian region including eastern Tennessee, most of Kentucky, the mountainous region of North Carolina, nor theastern Alabama, north Georgia, and 5 northwestern South Carolina. Finger (1984: xi i) pushes the formation of the Eastern Band back to 1819, as it was at this time that the more conservative element broke away from the others in their disgust over a treaty for land concessions. Many of them lived outside the new boundaries in the smal l settlements of Quallatown and Cheoah, proclaiming themselves citizens of the st ate of North Carolina (Finger 1984: 17). This nucleus would later attract those who resisted removal and became known as the Eastern Band. It took many years for this gr oup to establish their claim to tribal lands and settle the issue of their citizenship, especially after the Cherokee sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War. But t heir new tribal government was finally inaugurated in 1870 and the final deeds to the reservation executed by 1880 (Mooney 1900: 174). So Mooney's arrival in 1887 was at a pivotal point in Cherokee history, and even among this most conservative faction it was a time when they were increasingly abandoning their traditional ways (Finger 1984: 153). When considering the scope of Mooney's research among the Cherokee, one must remember that the bulk of his publ ications on the Cherokee came around or before 1900. His major works, Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees and Myths of the Cherokees , were published in 1891 and 1900 respectively and he published nothing on the Cherokee after 1900. Yet he collected and partially organized much additional information in the decades that followed thes e publications. Mooney's first field seasons occurred in 1887, 1888, and 1889, and his prim ary publications were based on these data. But Mooney also returned to the C herokee and collected additional data in 1913, 1914, and 1917. 6 Mooney was under pressure from his superiors to turn his research into publications, but, as was true with many of the salvage ethnographers, he was much more concerned with gathering of data t han synthesizing and publishing his findings (Moses 1984: 45). When questioned about the amount of material he gathered against the few publications he had penned, Mooney re sponded that the day of the Indian was a thing of the past and ethnologists must reco rd their history before it was gone (Moses 1984: 144). Mooney would rather assume the risk that his field notes would be of no use and unfathomable to successive researchers than miss an opportunity to acquire what he perceived as the last bits of know ledge from a dying race (Hinsley 1981: 224). As Mooney's health was failing in the later decades of his career and his interests had spread to several other Native American groups, he would have no choice but to leave the task of synthesizing and interpreting his materials to others. Powell's death in 1902 in some ways freed Mooney from the yoke of Morgan's evolutionary perspective and allowed him to immerse himself in the history and ethnography of specific groups (Hinsley 1981: 219). Caught between Powell's concept of the gentleman anthropologist and the newly emerging Boasian school of professional anthropology, Mooney had little theoretical fr amework for his studies and was more intent on telling the story of Native people to the public at large (Hinsley 1981: 224). What is obvious from Mooney's later dat a is that he changed some of his earlier biases toward Cherokee ethnobotanical k nowledge. Having once stated that, \"the medicine man's knowledge is about on a level wi th that of the ordinary farmer's wife\" (Mooney 1890), his later research expanded into their ethnobotanical system and a broader perspective on medicinal uses, pr eparation, and ecological knowledge of the 7 Cherokee plants. Unfortunately, he was never able to complete his planned multi- volume series on the Cherokee (Moses 1984: 123). After Mooney's death in 1921, Frans Olbrechts, a Belgian ethnographer, continued Mooney's work among the Cherokee. Olbrechts is best known for his 1932 posthumous collaboration with Mooney, The Swimmer Manuscript: Cherokee Sacred Formulas and Medicinal Prescriptions . Mooney died well before Olbrechts came to the United States, but by combining Mooney's sacred formulas and observations on plant use with his own observations on Cherokee medical practices, he was able to produce one of the finest published works known conc erning a Native American medical system. However, this would be his only major American work, as he returned to Belgium in 1929 to become director of the Mus\u00e9e du Congo Belge at Tervuren. Olbrechts began his studies in the United States when he received a fellowship for post-graduate studies in linguistics at Columbia where he studied under Franz Boas (Forde 1958). After completing his studies in 1926, he briefly returned to Belgium to marry, but was soon honeymooning with his new bride in the loft of a small cabin among the Eastern Cherokee in Jackson and Swain C ounties, North Carolina. He and his wife spent the winter and spring of 1926-27 liv ing with a Cherokee family, gathering materials on Cherokee religion and language in preparation for what would eventually become The Swimmer Manuscript (Alexander 1927). Much of The Swimmer Manuscript was posthumously attributed to Mooney's research, but as one becomes familiar with the published works and archival materials of both authors, Olbrechts' predominance in the text becomes evident. Olbrechts appeared to have a greater interest in a br oad range of topics inherent in the Cherokee 8 ethnomedical system such as their categories of disease and the combinations of herbs used in the formulas. But like Mooney he gav e little credence to the efficacy of their methods and appeared more concerned with ceremony and symbolism than the potential efficacy of the cures. John Witthoft was the next anthropologist to take an abiding interest in Cherokee ethnobiology. He developed his interest as one of the last graduate students to study under Frank Speck, a renowned ethnographer of the eastern Native Americans. Witthoft had a life-long interest in Cherokee et hnobiology and especially Cherokee ethnobotany, and he continued field research as a professo r of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1986. But the majority of his publications on the Cherokee were during his post-Masters research at Michigan, and he published little about the Cherokee after 1949 (Cotter 1996). This indicate s that much of his research was never published. A portion of that material was housed at the American Philosophical Society Archives in Philadelphia and is described below. The remainder has not yet been located and does not appear to be available to public scrutiny. Archival Materials and Primary Sources The bulk of Mooney's material that will be considered in this work comes from several manuscripts found among Mooney's archival materials housed at the Smithsonian Institution. The largest body of this material was from Ms. 2591 (n.d. a); a three-volume work hand-written by Mooney and entitled Cherokee Botany . This appears to be the framework for a planned later volume, or series of volumes, on Cherokee ethnobotany. Each page was devoted to a particular plant and the more complete 9 entries included the botanical name, the Cher okee name, Mooney's gloss of the name, the etymology of the name, and the medici nal uses for the plant. It was in these volumes that Mooney also made the bulk of his notes concerning the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system. However, th is was a work in progress and much of these data is missing for many of the plants. Often in this manuscript only the Cherokee name or botanical name is recorded or the gloss for the name was not available. Mooney would gather some of this material in later field seasons, but he did not thoroughly update his data in Cherokee Botany . Another source from these material s that aided in cross-referencing the Cherokee names to botanical names is a coll ection of forty-three labels that were attached to the plant specimens that M ooney sent back to the Smithsonian to be identified (n.d. b, Ms. 2497). The label s, penned by Mooney, had the Cherokee names and bits of information about the plant on one side and a botanical designation, penned by the identifying botanist, on the other side. Most of these are dated from September of 1911. Three small pocket notebooks, labeled by Mooney as \"Medical Notes\", provided an indication that Mooney's attention had sh ifted towards a more complete botanical pharmacopoeia in his later Cherokee research (n.d.c, Ms. 1894). The notebooks contain 119 Cherokee names for plants and a range of botanical, environmental and cultural applications. There is often a description of the plant, a description of its habitat, medical conditions it would treat, and prepar ation techniques. Occasionally, there is also a note on whether the plant was dried for fu ture use or identified in winter from its 10 dried stalk, as well a few references about plants gathered to sell to white traders or the Cherokee knowledge of how it was used by local whites. Also in the same manuscript package is a list of 117 Cherokee plants compiled by Mooney in 1913 and the botanical name for eac h recorded by a different researcher. This would suggest that Mooney had collec ted these plants and sent them to the Smithsonian to be determined to species. A similar manuscript (n.d.d, Ms. 2235) consisted of eighteen pages of plants lis ted by their botanical name with the corresponding Cherokee name in the column beside it. For further verification of the botanical names I also was permitted to view the herbarium accession records of 272 plants that were collected by Mooney. The dates of entry into the collection are missing from the copies of records provided to me by the herbarium staff. However, I was able to match the accession numbers to two specimens collected in 1888, suggesting that these may have been ascescioned around this time. In a letter to Powell dated September 8, 1889 (Mooney 1982a), Mooney indicated that he had collected around 300 plants and I assu me that these are the mentioned specimens. I did not manage to get copies of the accession records for Mooney's later collections from 1911-1913 and I found no specimens in the collection from this period. The herbarium was not cataloged in a way that made this material accessible; at the time of my research it was in disarray due to construction. However, in a 1916 statement of his research (Mooney 1982), Mooney indicated that he had collected 500 to 600 specimens by 1913, so that record ma y still exist. Generally the entries in the located accession records were identified to the genus level, but many were determined to the species level by botanists at the Smithsonian Institution. 11 Several small manuscripts and random not es on scraps of paper also provide a substantial amount of material. Twenty-one plants are identified by common names and their Cherokee names in Ms. 2282 (n.d.e). Most of Ms. 2285 (n.d.f) is missing, but the Cherokee and botanical names for ten or so plants, fungi, and mosses are still available. The bulk of Olbrechts' Cherokee material is also housed in the Smithsonian Institution's Anthropology Archives. Olbrec hts' materials consist of one set of papers (Ms. 4600) that included several typed manuscrip ts. The most impressive portion of this is his Cherokee Botanical Materia Medica . This document consists of individual pages devoted to the Cherokee name, local co mmon name, botanical name, and various medicinal uses for several hundred plants. In his introduction to these notes, Olbrechts admits that it was not his original intenti on to collect information on Cherokee medical botany, but when the opportunity presented it self he recorded an impressive body of knowledge. He claimed his material wa s gathered independently of Mooney's influence and, as it was 35 to 40 years later, that he used many different informants. However, some of Mooney's informants were still aliv e and were central to Olbrechts' data. The numbering system used in this material suggests that there were at least 546 plants originally referenced but many pages are absent and Olbrecht's numbering system is erratic. Olbrechts indicated that he referred to the plants by their reference numbers, so the numbering system may just be collection numbers and only the medicinal plants were discussed in this docum ent. He did write that he did not have time to properly investigate non-medicinal plants. 12 Olbrechts also appeared to be prepari ng another document on the Cherokee system of disease classification. Ther e are 196 entries discribing ethnomedical conditions, including their Cherokee names, the glosses for the Cherokee names, and the treatments applied by the Cherokee healers for the condition. Some of these were described in The Swimmer Manuscript , but a majority of them were not included in any published materials. While not all of thes e were treated with plant-based remedies, those that were often include the applicati on of several formulas or single herbs. Witthoft's A Cherokee Economic Botany from Western North Carolina: Man and Nature in the Southern Appalachians (not dated), an unpublished manuscript housed at the American Philosophical Society Archives in Philadelphia, describes a wide range of plant uses. He includes chapters on wild edibl e greens, roots, fruits and seeds as well as mushrooms, poisonous plants, dye pl ants, and fiber bearing plants. It includes extensive descriptions of Cherokee baske t weaving, log cabin construction, and woodcrafts. The final chapter describes C herokee farming practices and the processing of farm products. Interspersed throughout are re ferences to the medicinal uses of the plants described and a few references to the botanical classification system. I have also recently acquired the bot anical portions of the Payne/Butrick Manuscript (not dated), the compilati on by John Howard Payne of Cherokee ethnographic material predominantly collected by missionary Daniel S. Butrick just before and around the time of removal. The original document, housed at the Newberry Library in Chicago, consists of four volumes of late 18 th and early 19th century ethnographic materials concerning the Cherokee. I was provided with extracts of the documents containing references to medici nal and ceremonial plant use, the plants 13 usually identified with a Cherokee name recorded by Butrick. While not a comprehensive ethnobotanical account, there is enough information to identify the majority of the named species and this wi ll provide more information for cross- referencing purposes. Two Masters theses on Cherokee plant use also augment the materials of previous researchers. William Banks' Ethnobotany of the Cherokee Indians (1953) and Myra Jean Perry's Food Use of \"Wild\" Plants by Cherokee Indians (1974) both contain a substantial amount of primary research and some linguistic data. These will aid in cross- referencing Cherokee names with botanical species and supplementing their medicinal and edible applications. Banks work may prove the most useful as he included nearly 250 plants identified to at least the genus le vel and often provided several versions of their Cherokee names. Perry's work, while not as comprehensive, still fills a valuable niche with its focus on the wild edible plants of the Cherokee. The Cherokee informant base varied over t he tenure of the different researchers. Most of the medicine men who remembered t he pre-removal period died just before or in the early years of Mooney's resear ch (Mooney 1982b). Olbrechts used some of Mooney's sources, but attempted to develop his own informant base as a means to separate his work from Mooney's consi derable influence (Ms. 4600). However, one common thread that colored Cherokee res earch from Mooney's first field season through the work of John Witthoft was t he Cherokee informant Will West Long. Long's background bridged the Cherokee and Euroamerican worlds. He was the son of a Cherokee Baptist minister and was raised in a traditional Cherokee household in the part of the reservation known as the Big Cove, one of the more conservative 14 Cherokee communities in western North Caro lina. While at the reservation school, Long learned to read and write both in English and the Cherokee syllabary. He began working with Mooney as a scribe and continued as an interpreter during Mooney's subsequent visits to the reservation. His abiding in terest in his Cherokee heritage made him an extremely valuable informant to subsequent researchers such as Olbrechts, Frank Speck, William Gilbert, Leonard Bloom, and J ohn Witthoft (Witthoft 1948). Banks also attributed a portion of his information to Long, but this material must have been borrowed from Witthoft's research. Long di ed in 1947, five years before Banks' research. Cherokee Ethnobotanical Classification One of the most salient features of Mooney's archival materials was his keen observation of the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system. Mooney used terms and concepts in the first decades of the 20th century usually attributed to later researchers starting with Conklin in 1954 (B erlin 1992: 4). However, there is no doubt Mooney was cognizant of the pattern inherent in the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification systems and, had he finis hed his work, it would undoubtedly have been influential in the development of the field. Mooney made his intention to focus on the classification systems clear in the following note dated May 10,1889, that he sent to Professor G. Brown Goode at the National Museum of Natural History: 15 Your note is at hand. I should feel rather pleased to know that I had found a species before unknown in the North Carolina mountains. I expect to return there in July and want to give consi derable attention then to collecting botanic and natural history specimens, in order to get at the Cherokee basis of classification, and hope then to throw more light on the insect question. Mooney also recorded his interview methodology (Ms. 1894), which showed excellent technique for determining and developing an ethnobotanical classification system. When Mooney came across a name for a new plant, he would ask his other informants, \"Do you know it?\". If they we re familiar with the plant he had named, he would try to determine its availability and prox imity to the reservation by asking, \"How far away is it?\". When he was sure they were discussing the same plant, he would ask, \"How many kinds are there?\" and follow up with, \"Are there any other kinds?\". Then he would request that his informant bring him a sa mple of every kind of that folk genus that was known. He would also ask the inform ant to bring him samples of the fruit and flowers when they were available. This methodology was sufficient to produce a basic framework for the Cherokee ethnobotanical system. Medical Ethnobotany Medical ethnobotany lies at the interfac e of the human pursuit of well-being and the propensity of plants to produce a variet y of chemical products that provide a selective advantage in their struggle for surv ival (Briskin 2000, Williams et al. 1989). Rarely considered as a distinct field, m edical ethnobotany is usually subsumed in its 16 sister field, ethnopharmacology (Etkin 1988), but distinguishes itself through a focus on the promotion of traditional therapies and a great er concern with the context of plant use rather than a concern with potential pharma ceutical products (Berlin and Berlin 1994). In this work, piecing together the medical ethnobotany of the Cherokee will require a comparison of the works of t he researchers discussed above and assembling relevant information. The medicinal or edi ble uses, ecological considerations, gathering and processing instructions, linguistic analysis, and cultural beliefs will be assembled for each species. All this information will rarely be available for every species; however, as much as possible must be assembled to approach as complete an investigation as is feasible. Structure of the Dissertation This work is structured around Mooney 's direct or implied system of ethnobiological classification. Many concepts now established as integral aspects of ethnobiological classification systems, such as the intermediate categories so prevalent in Mooney's notes on the herbaceous plants, were not formally developed until long after Mooney's work, but they are none the less implied from the structure of his notes. This present work differs from Fradkin's (1990) work on the Cherokee ethnozoological classification system in that the concept s of classification used herein are based on Mooney's observations and analysis, and not on currently accepted models of ethnobiological classification. It is essential that the data are handled in this manner to support the premise Mooney's interpretati on predated current models and that current models are not being imposed on t he Cherokee ethnobotanical system. 17 I will begin with a discussion of t he Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system, including Mooney's observations of it s structure, the relationship of his observations to the findings of later resear chers, and an analysis of the patterns that are obvious in the collective data. This will be followed by a discussion of Mooney as a researcher and an analysis of his philosophical perspective and research biases. Subsequent chapters are arranged by the life form categories as presented in the myth of the origin of medicine, \"Each tr ee, shrub, and herb, down even to the grasses and mosses, agreed to furnish a remedy for some of the diseases named...\" (Mooney 1891: 323). Added to these will be the ferns and fungi, which Mooney appeared to handle as distinctive life forms. Each life form will be discussed in terms of its overall relevance to the Cherokee and the structure of the sub-life form rank ings. The Cherokee names of the individual folk genera, species, and varietals will be presented with the glosses and semantic analysis provided by the various researcher s, the botanical names will be matched to the Cherokee name, and any medicinal or edibl e qualities of the plant as used by the Cherokee will be discussed. The major wor ks of other researchers mentioned above will be consulted to augment and cross-refe rence the data provided by Mooney and Olbrechts. Those plants for which no Cherok ee name, gloss for the Cherokee name, or botanical species name are available will also be included in the work to provide as complete a record as possible and provide a base of reference for future researchers. The folk genera and species included in each life form category are listed in alphabetical order by their Cherokee names to assist researchers identifying plant references from historical works. Indice s of botanical species, arranged in alphabetical 18 order by their Latin names and matched wi th their associated Cherokee genera or species, are included in the introduction to each li fe form to facilitate cross-referencing. Following this is a re-evaluation of the medical ethnobotanical data and a discussion of how this reflects on acc epted models of the Cherokee ethnomedical system. This will include a discussion of t he discrepancies and oversights found in the assertions of the various researchers, an evalution of the humoral component and Cherokee health concerns from an ethnobot anical perspective, and a discussion of symbolism as selection criteria for plant-based remedies. Included at the end of this work is an appendix that examines the Cherokee disease categories and the corresponding botani cal formulas that were gathered by Olbrechts. Several Cherokee folk illnesses are discussed in The Swimmer Manuscript , but few of the various botanical formulas were included and many discussed in Olbrechts' notes were not included in the final work. The appendix will be necessary to cross-reference the Cherokee ethnomedical condi tions with the individual remedies. I have used Mooney's phonetic spellings when available and substituted these for the phonetic spellings of other researcher 's when possible. This was important for the continuity of the work and for explanati ons of the etymology of the plant names. However, since Olbrechts and the other res earchers recorded many of these, and they had no counterpart in Mooney's notes, I hav e not included a pronunciation guide to the phonetic symbols. Mooney did not include one in his published works and Olbrechts has been criticized for including sounds not found in the Cherokee language (Banks 1953: xiv). The Cherokee language was in a state of transition during Mooney's research, as evidenced by his recording of both Middle and Upper Cherokee names for plants, and 19 the language has changed significantly since his work (Alexander 1971: title page). Olbrechts' system was based on an inter national model, and is useless without a working knowledge of German and French (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 11-13). As this present work is an historical analysis of Cherokee ethnobotany, lack of a pronunciation guide will not affect the nature of this work. Relevance to Anthropology This research addresses the debate over whether ethnobiological classification systems are imposed by the researcher (Ellen 1979: 13) or are a universal feature of human cognition (Berlin et al. 1973, Berlin 1992). It is notable that Mooney recorded the patterns and principles inherent in the Cherokee ethnobotanical system well before he could have been influenced by any published theoret ical or comparative material on the subject. Comparison of his observations on the principles of Cherokee ethnobotanical classification to those proposed as universal to all systems will address the issue of universality, as it appears to be difficu lt to argue that Mooney was imposing a preconceived framework over his data. Expanding the knowledge of potentially useful medicinal plants from the Southern Appalachian region, an acknowledged center of medicinal plant diversity (Price 1960), should provide a basis for research in est ablishing a more pluralistic medical system. The growing interest in alternative and complementary medicine will require an expanded understanding of plant-based medici nes, and those used in traditional medical systems are considered to be especially efficacious (Trotter and Logan 1986). 20 A basis of comparison must be established before issues over the nature of change in traditional knowledge can be addressed. How is traditional knowledge transmitted and maintained in a society? Is traditional knowledge lost when a culture is absorbed by a dominant society or is it transformed by the persistence of cultural values (Inglehart and Baker 2000, Ryder et al. 2000)? These ques tions can not be addressed without the basic understanding of what constitutes the tr aditional knowledge of a group. This basis can be established through the re-evaluation of historical materials, comparing them to contemporary studies, and determining the nat ure of diachronic change in traditional knowledge. The global ecological crisis is having a dramatic impact on traditional medical systems. Around 80% of the population of developing countries depends on plant-based traditional medicines for their primary means of health care (Moran 1997). The relative affordability of medicinal plants when compared to pharmaceuticals (McCaleb 1997) and the loss of an estimated 4,000 or more species of plants and animals per year (Southwick 1996: 253) create a growing need fo r potential replacement therapies for lost local species. The inherent botanica l diversity in the Southern Appalachian Mountains coupled with the ethnomedical knowledge of the indigenous people should contribute to the quest towards global health security. The consolidation and organization of this mate rial will facilitate the repatriation of Cherokee traditional botanical knowledge to the tr ibe from its relative inaccessibility in the archives of the Smithsonian In stitution. The return of this portion of their rich cultural legacy could aid the Cherokee in several ways: 21 \u0083 It can provide documentation for potential legal cases involving intellectual property rights concerning their traditional botanical knowledge as well as with contested access to traditional resources on public lands. \u0083 It will provide the basic information necessary for the development of a culturally based industry associated with the blossoming market in botanical medicines and plant-based products. This is especially relevant in an area where unemployment is well above the national average. \u0083 It can be used to aid the Cherokee in their efforts to re-establish their cultural identity, subject to decades of assaul t from social forces and official governmental policies, and to enhance thei r sense of pride in their Cherokee heritage. 22 Chapter 2 Cherokee Ethnobotanical Classification System One of my primary goals in this res earch is to demonstrate that Mooney recognized an inherent structure in t he Cherokee ethnobotanical system, and this system is comparable to contemporary model s. I will use Berlin's (1972, 1976, 1992) hierarchical ranks as a model for comparis on. These ranks include the categories of kingdom, life form, intermediate, generic, s pecific, and varietal. All were developed to some degree in the notes of Mooney and the works of other Cherokee researchers. Kingdom The most inclusive rank in folk biologica l classification is the kingdom. This rank is often unnamed in folk systems (Berlin, 1992). Mooney gives no Cherokee term for the plant kingdom; however, in Myths of the Cherokees (1900) he recounts the story of the origin of disease. In this story, the plant s decide to provide all medicines necessary to counteract the diseases inflicted upon humans by the animals. \"Each tree, Shrub, and Herb, down even to the Grasses and Mosses, agreed to furnish a cure for some one of each of the diseases named...\" The concept of the plant kingdom as an incl usive category is evident in the myth of the origin of medicine. We see the plant s as a unified entity functioning with collective intent. What is not clear is whether Mooney ever procured a discrete lexical entity for 23 the plant kingdom. If he did, it was not present in his notes or published material. It was also not included in any of the Cherokee plant names, as were such concepts as \"herbaceous\" or \"woody\". When Mooney or Olbr echts use the concept of \"plant\" in a name, such as when Olbrechts glossed g\u00e1w's\u00fbk as 'the smelling (plant), it is always an implied concept and placed in parentheses, never a direct gloss of a part of a name. Olbrechts did find that the Cherokee l anguage, \"possesses words to express such concepts as \"herbs (in general)\"\", but he did not say what they were and he indicates that they were rarely used (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932:53). Life Form The rank of life form generally consists of a small group of highly inclusive terms that represent a few shared gross morphological char acteristics. Taxa of lesser rank are commonly included in the life form rank (Berlin, 1976). The Cherokee terms for the majority of these were found among Mooney's materials and most were labeled by him as \"generic\" terms. But Mooney's use of \"generic \" is a more inclusive term than that of the folk generic, perceived as the basis fo r ethnobiological systems (Berlin 1992: 53). Some of the life forms were clearly l abeled in Mooney's notes. For example, when distinguishing the life form kan\u00e9ska , he states that it is \"the generic name for all grasses.\" However, some labels had to be gleaned from the specific qualifiers included in individual plant names. These are all incl uded and explained in the individual life form chapters. For the remainder of this discussion of the life form category, I would like to examine some trends that were obvious at this level of classification. 24 Berlin has asserted that the likeli hood of a semantically opaque or unanalyzable name generally increases with cultural sali ence (Berlin 1992: 256). Analysis of the ratio of opaque to transparent generic Cherokee names shows that the life form inclusive of the trees was more likely to have members with opaque names than other life forms. Of 49 folk genera, 33 or 67% had opaque names. The ratio diminished with size of the life forms. Of the 38 folk genera of shrubs and vines, only 13 or 34% were labeled with opaque names. At the herbaceous level, only 19 of 174, or 11% of folk genera were labeled with opaque names, and of these, elev en were either crop plants or popular edible non-cultigens. There were no opaque names in the remaining life form categories. It is not surprising that trees would dem onstrate such a high degree of cultural salience in an Eastern Woodlands tribe like the Cherokee. As Hunn has pointed out (1999: 49), the size of an organism will relate to its perceptual salience, and this will often translate to cultural salience. Also, if tree species are the first to appear in an ethnobotanical classification system (Berli n 1972, Brown 1977, Atran 1985), then the prevalence of opaquely named genera in this life form may be due to the persistence of names whose meaning has long been forgotten. What is surprising in the Cherokee example is the precipitous drop off in the number of opaquely named genera in smaller life forms. Hunn proposed that much of the biota in an area is unclassified because it is too small to be noticed. But in this case, most species recorded are of a noticeable size. The shrubs are proportionately half as likely as trees to be labeled with an opaque name, and of the 14 that are opaquely named, si x have edible seeds or fruits. Edibility appears to be a significant factor in t he retention of an opaque name for shrubby and 25 herbaceous life forms. This would support Ber lin's contention that cultural salience increases the likelihood that a name would be opaque. Many of the plants in the smaller life form categories were useful as medicines, but this would have been specialized knowledge and not deeply ensconced in the Cher okee culture. Tree species also played a significant role in the Cherokee ethnom edical system, but this aspect will be analyzed and discussed in the final chapter. Intermediate Intermediate categories are generally identifi ed by a primary lexeme that indicates a salient feature, usually morphological simila rities, shared by a number of often unrelated biological genera, and, as Mooney's data demons trates, from several plant families (Berlin, 1976). As mentioned above, Mooney refe rred to these lexical distinctions as \"generic\" terms, indicating his acknowledgem ent of inclusive categories. In the Cherokee system, inclusion in an intermedi ate category was designated by several criteria. These may include shared coloration of plants or plant parts, plants that change in color due to mechanical manipulation, pl ants or plant parts that share inherent qualities other than color (leaves resemb ling ashes, dirty appearance of the roots), plants having a strong odor, or a shared mec hanical feature (burrs). While generally few in number in most folk classifica tion systems, Mooney's notes on the Cherokee indicate that this is a significant category in their system. I discuss the intermediate categories in the chapters on herbaceous species because, with rare exceptions, they were exclusively composed of herbaceous plants. The exceptions were two shrubby plants and a grass from the category dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'), and a tree from the category \u00fbnag\u00e9 ('black'). It would appear from this observation that 26 use of a color term as the basis for a name was merely descriptive and not due to a higher level of inclusiveness. Without a mo re detailed account of Mooney's interview data, it is impossible to be sure of the inclusiveness of the color-based categories. However, Mooney clearly defined the remain ing categories and they were exclusively herbaceous in content. Generic The category of folk genera typically includes the largest number of folk categories and tends to correspond most closely to the biological species level (Berlin, 1992: 23). This is reflected in Mooney's use of the term \"species\", or the related \"specific\", which appears to be congruent with the currently a ccepted rank of folk generic. When referring to the intermediate category of nug\u00fbla or k- nug\u00fbla, which he glosses as 'scratcher', Mooney indicated that each thorny shrub or vine in this category also had a \"specific\" Cherokee name. Also, in the description of t he formation of folk species and varietals below, he refers to the \"species\" as the unit being differentiated by a qualifying adjective. While his nomenclature referring to the different ethnobiological ranks may be different than the currently accepted termi nology, it is obvious that his meaning was congruent with the definition of the fo lk generic in contemporary models of ethnobiological classification systems. Mooney (1890b) used the term \"generic\" in an early work (see below), which appears to used in the same manner as the currently accepted definition of the folk generic, but changed it to \"species\" in his later work. The Cherokee system appears to be atypical in one aspect: the ratio of taxa, 27 while polytypic genera will have two or more taxa designated by a specific qualifier. Typical folk classification systems will c onsist of approximately 80% monotypic genera (Berlin 1992: 23). In this work, the ratio is much lower, with 209 of 310 genera, or 67%, of genera recorded as monotypic. In determi ning this figure, I only included the most common names reported by the researchers, so it is not a precise figure. But the Cherokee synonyms recorded for many of the plants tended to classify the plants in other polytypic genera, so if all could be considered as independent aspects of the Cherokee taxonomy, the ratio would appear to be much lower than 67% if all synonyms were included. Mooney may have explained this apparent anomaly in his discussion of Cherokee medical practices (1890b). When discussing how the medicine men differentiate between related plants, Mooney wrote: Each doctor commonly only knows but a few of the species included under one generic name ... Consequently, when obliged to distinguish different species having the same generic name, they are completely at a loss. Each man is apt to have a different basis of classification, and no one knows how many plants are included under the common name, or what descriptive term will sufficiently distinguish each from the other s. It is only by comparison of the plants brought in by each name that it is f ound that half a dozen distinct terms are intended to designate the same species. 28 Mooney made a similar comment when voici ng his frustration on the formation of specific and varietal taxa (see below). When considering the apparent variation among informants, it must be noted that the majo rity of Mooney's and Olbrechts' informants were medicine men, specialists that woul d have had significantly more plant knowledge than the average Cherokee. When challenged by their interviewer, they would have used descriptors that distinguished the mo st salient differences between similar species. They would have recognized the various species as different, often with unrelated uses, but may not have previously labeled them or shared that knowledge with others. This is apparent in the text of this work from the large number of synonyms recorded for many of the biological species and the distinct uses applied to them. What is not known is whether the general Cher okee population would be able to distinguish the subtle variation in a folk genus and if this would have influenced the ratio of monotypic to polytypic genera. The names for the Cherokee folk gener a were constructed around a range of concepts, but the most common by far were organoleptic qualities inherent in the plants. The primacy of vision among the senses wa s reflected in the Cherokee choice of names, but smell, taste, touch, and sound we re also represented. Names that involved a visual quality usually described a salient morphological feature that distinguished the folk genus. For example, Magnolia fraseri was known as tsugwal\u00e2ga tsegwa ('big leaves'), a name describing the large leaves, which reach lengths of up to half a meter. Polymnia uvedalia was called gt\u00e2yt ('it has gone round'), also describing the leaves, which surround the stem. 29 The sense of smell was especially evident in the genera included in the intermediate category g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ('smeller'), whose members are not ed for their prominent scents. The members of this category were mostly in the mint family, but it also included muskmelon. Monarda clinopodia was called dilaiy\u00fast ('skunk-like'), a reference to its pungent odor. Species of Oxalis , commonly known as sourgrass, were included in the genus tsunts\u00e2y'st ('it is sour'), reflecting its promi nent sour taste. The sense of touch was evident in the Cherokee name utsal\u00e9st ('it is sticky'), the Cherokee name for wheat, Triticum aestivum . The name was descriptive of the consistency of dough made with wheat flour. Names that depicted sound usually referred to noises made be dried seed pods, such as anisg\u00edna-(ts)un\u00e2 ns\u00fbta ('ghosts' terrapin rattles'), the name applied to Dioscorea villosa . Utility and ecological function also played a role in the construction of Cherokee generic names. Erigeron canadensis was known as atsils\u00fbt ('fire, to make with'), due to its prominent role in the making of ceremonial fires. Mitchella repens was known as tl\u00fbt\u00edst un\u00edgist ('pheasant food'), a reference to the succulent red berries that are often eaten by game birds. Considering the long history of contac t with Europeans before Mooney's work and the incorporation of introduced species in the Cherokee diet and pharmacopoeia, it is surprising that there were only two examples of the conversion of an English name to a Cherokee folk genus. Coffee, Coffea arabica , became k\u00e1w, as there is no \"f\" sound in the Cherokee language and cucumber, Cucurmis sativus , was slightly changed to kagama . Onomatopoeia, generally a common featur e in folk zoological classification systems, was represented by a single example in the Cherokee ethnobotanical 30 classification system. The tall thistle, Cirsium altissimum , was known as ts\u00edts, a replication of the sound made by a blowgun dar t. The down of this particular thistle was used as the primary material to fletch darts. Mooney's notes indicate that the concept of the prototypical taxon was apparent in the Cherokee ethnobotanical taxonomic system and was expressed at the level of the folk generic. This feature was observ ed among several Native American groups (Gatschet 1899), typically by the addition of a secondary lexeme, suffix, or prefix to indicate the \"true\" or \"real\" plant of a cat egory. This would be the member of a category that embodied the defining characteristics of the category, also known as the \"type specific\" or a \"type-species\" (Berlin 1972, Berlin 1992: 110). In the Cherokee system, the suffix - y\u00fb or -y, glossed by Mooney as 'true' or 'real', was added to indicate the most repres entative member of a more inclusive taxa. This concept functioned at both the intermediat e and generic levels of classification. At the intermediate level Desmodium nudiflorum , or tick-trefoil, is designated as \u00fanistil\u00fbist-yu or the 'true \u00fanistil\u00fbist', being prototypical of an inclusive category of burrs that shared the morphological feature of being able to 'stick flat to a hairy substance.' Agertina altissima , yet another example of the mo st prototypical member of an intermediate category, was called g\u00e1tats\u00fal-ya, or the 'true' form of g\u00e1tats\u00fal ('it has dirt in it'). It was considered the most protot ypical of plants that appear to remain dirty after they are washed. At the level of the folk genus, examples of the prototypical member of a category included the curly variety of Brassica oleracea and certain species of the genus Pinus . was considered the 'true' cabbage, or tsug\u00fbnt\u00e9ayu , tsug\u00fbnt\u00e9a being 31 the folk generic name for broad-leafed varieties of cabbage. Natsuya was glossed as 'true pine', but the exact botanical species is not clear (see nats in the chapter on trees). Not all of the prototypical folk genera or intermediate categories were labeled. Rubus ideaus was known simply as s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l ('bowl'), but other members of this folk genus were labeled with specific qualifiers. This would indicate that R. ideaus was the embodiment of the characteristics of a typical s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l. Cucumis melo , the muskmelon, became a relished food of the Cherokee afte r its introduction and, due to its fragrant flesh, became prototypical of the intermediate category g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ('smeller'). The unmodified folk generic may have been a more common expression of prototypicality than those labeled by - y\u00fb or -y, but the labeled lexemes demonstrate unambiguous prototypicality. While prototypicality expresses the highes t level of inclusiveness in a category, with the properties of the prototypical tax on defining the category, there is often a need to express a relationship between two taxa based on the perception of shared inherent qualities. In his discussion of the co mprehensiveness of the Mayan ethnobotanical system, Berlin proposed that unnamed taxa are included in a taxonomic scheme through a perceived similarity to a named taxon (1999: 73). The informant may not know what the plant is called, but will rec ognize that it is similar to or \"conceptually related to\" a known, named taxon. But in an historical ethnobotany such as this, I am limited by the plant names that were doc umented. Unnamed species are rarely included on plant lists. The conceptual relationship between taxa was recognized and labeled in 32 the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system by the addition of the suffix -iy\u00fast ('like' or 'as') to a known name. One of the best examples of this concept is the introduced species, Oenothera biennis . Oenothera fruticosa is a native species, known to the Cherokee as at\u00e1ts\u00fb ('trout') because of its speckled leaves, which resemble the patterns on a trout. Oenothera biennis was called at\u00e1ts\u00fb-iy\u00fast ('like at\u00e1ts\u00fb') due to its close resemblance to O. fruticosa . The two are so similar that it takes careful inspection to identify them in the field. But they have very different blooming habits, O. biennis , commonly known as evening primrose, blooming around sunset, and O. fruticosa , commonly known as sundrops, blooming in full sunlight. Even though O. biennis had several medicinal applications and was gathered in the spri ng as an edible green, it retained the subordinate position of being 'like' the native O. fruticosa , a plant with no recorded Cherokee use. Among the tree species, Platanus occidentalis was labeled as kuwiyust ('like mulberry'), due to Morus unega ('white mulberry'). While the use of -iy\u00fast alone was not enough to signify an inclusive relationship at the level of the folk genus, the synonym kuw\u00fb unega strongly suggests that P. occidentalis was considered a kind of kuw\u00fb. The similarity between P. occidentalis and M. rubra is less evident than the comparison in the previous example. Bo th have aggregate fruit and large, simple leaves, but the fruit of P. occidentalis are dry and fibrous, nothing like the succulent fruit of M. rubra , and the shape and surface of the leaves is dissimilar in the two species. But 33 the Cherokee perceived enough of a conceptual relationship between the two species to label P. occidentalis with the comparative suffix -iy\u00fast. The suffix -iy\u00fast also had number of other applications which were used to express a range of concepts. While the primar y use was to signify a resemblance of one plant to another, seemingly in the same folk genus, it could also referto a plant in a completely different botanical genus and frequently a different life from. The suffix often indicated an exclusive relationship rather than inclusive one, suggesting that the labeled plant was not a member of the folk genus to which it is being compared. When the relationship appeared to be exclusive, the suffix -iy\u00fast was added to describe a significant morphological similarity bet ween two plants or plant categories. For example, Potentilla canadensis was known as aniy\u00fast, in reference to its resemblance to Fragaria virginiana , the strawberry or \u00e1na. The leaf and flower morphology is quite similar, as is the grow th habit, but the number of leaflets, flower color, and fruit type are all different. Potentilla canadensis was not a kind of \u00e1na, but could easily be described as being 'like' \u00e1na. Another example comes from Mooney's explanation of the taxa included in the intermediate category ts\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like tobacco'). Mooney's statement that they were classified, \"not on account of similar use or general appearance, but on account of having a simila r flower and seed stalk\" strongly suggests that were considered a separate ta xon from the types of tobacco ( ts\u00e2l\u00e2). Other examples from the intermediat e categories tend to cross life form boundaries. The category natsiy\u00fast ('like a pine tree') was so named because the habit of its members resembled the branches of pine trees. However, none were woody species and there is no indication that they were considered a type of pine. This also 34 happened at the level of folk genus. Aruncus dioicus was known as tiliy\u00fast ('like chestnut'), due the resemblance of the inflor that of the American chestnut, Castanea dentata . It is unlikely that these two plants, one an herbaceous plant, the other a large tree, were considered the same \"kinds\" based on inflorescence morphology alone, but the conceptual relationship based on inflorescence morphology was clearly labeled in the name. When -iy\u00fast was part of a subgeneric qualifier, it could be used to describe a perceived similarity between members of different kingdoms. For instance, Pityopsis graminifolia was known as k\u00e2st\u00fata selikway\u00fbst ('simulating ashes, like a green snake') due to the resemblance of the long leaves to the green snake, selikw\u00e1ya . Subgeneric qualifiers could also contain -iy\u00fast canescens was called \u00fanistil\u00fbist sakanigiy\u00fast ukwal\u00e1ga ('they stick flat to a hairy substance, bluish leaved'), due to the grayis h or bluish cast to the leaves from the dense pubescence. Sakanigiy\u00fast literally meant 'like blue'; not a true blue, but giving the impression of blueness. So, while the prim ary function of this linguistic construction was to signify a relationship at the generic level, it was by no means limited to this function. Specific and Varietal The most outstanding example of Mooney's insight into the Cherokee folk system was evident in the following description of the linguistic production of specific and varietal taxa among the category of herbs with a strong smell ( g\u00e1w's\u00fbk or 'smeller'): 35 No adjective term is added unless it becomes necessary to distinguish species and then the adjectives used generally serve only to distinguish the species in hand, necessitating a new set of adjectives as often as new specimens are added to the series. Thus with two specimens the most obvious visual distinction is \u00fatana (large) or usd\u00edga (small), but when another specimen, or two, is brought in, these words must be discarded and another basis of classification adopted. Bartlett (1940) made a similar observati on in his discussion of the development of the genus concept in botanical classification systems (in Berlin 1972): With enlarging experience, people make finer distinctions and need different names for newly distinguis hed entities which have previously been called by the same generic name. The original name becomes generic in its application; variously qualified it prov ides the basis of specific names. Both statements are quite similar to Be rlin's generalization on folk specifics: \"contrasting specific taxa differ on the basis of very few morphological characteristics, many of which are readily visible and some times verbalizable (Berlin 1991: 104).\" It also relates to the principle of classifi cation concerning the partitioning of the generic rank into species and varietals: \"Taxa of t he rank of folk species partition folk generic taxa into two or more members; in those syst ems where they occur, folk varietals further subdivide folk species (Berlin 1992: 24).\" 36 However, Mooney also voiced his frustr ation at the degree of variation in the Cherokee system. The large number of synonyms extant for a single botanical species led him to write the following about a species of mint: As a sample of the worthlessness of Indian specific classification it may be stated that this species was desi gnated, under three of these designations being given by the same man, while another described the Pycnanthemum muticum as g\u00e1w's\u00fbk \u00fatana ('large smeller'). The phenomenon of several synonyms appears to be most common among the herbaceous plants, but the only explanation for this phenomenon appears to be overdifferentiation by Cherokee m edicine men as described above. While the designation of a 'large' and 'small' variety was the most common means of differentiating multiple member s of a folk genus, flower color and the ecological niche of the folk species under consideration were commonly incorporated into specific qualifiers. Mooney identified two folk species of Pedicularis canadensis based on the color of the flower. The yellow flowered form was labeled as uguk\u00fask dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk ('owl's head, yellow-flowered'), while Botanists consider Pedicularis canadensis to be a single species with variable flower color. Several species of violets commonly found in the Southern Appalachian region were 37 differentiated into folk species by the rec ognition of, among other criteria, various flower colors. The violets were included in the folk genus dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk ('they pull each other's heads off'), but some were classified into folk species with the addition of the qualifiers an ecologically heterogeneous region like the Southern Appalachians, an area of ample rainfall and changing elevation, t here microclimates and isolated habitats are common. This would provide a variety of natural and anthropogenic ecological niches that could house a diverse flora, some with specific habitat requirements. The Cherokee appreciation for this ecological heterogeneity was linguistically represented by the addition of the suffix - h ('living' or 'dwelling') added to term representing an ecological habitat. The habitat terms usually represent common aspects of the environment, such as wet areas or steep slopes , but they could also represent a very limited niche. For instance, qualifying adjec tives could be quite subtle, demonstrating such fine distinctions as gatush ('mountain dwelling') and g\u00fbtlat\u00fbh ('growing on the mountainside'). Other environmental qual ifiers demonstrated the wide range of environmental situations, such as an anthr opogenic ecosystem represented by the term klayuh ('growing in old fields') or the perc eption of inherent in the term inagh ('growing in the wilderness'). Limit ed niche requirements were labeled with terms like kutlah ('growing under the beech tree') or nuny\u00e2hi- h ('rock dwelling'). There are at least 16 environmental descriptors included in this work, a few more if synonymous root terms are consider ed independently. For instance, the terms ig\u00e2tenh and saluyh were both glossed as 'swamp growing', but were derived from 38 the root words ig\u00e2t and sal\u00fayi respectively. The specificity of the Cherokee terms suggests that their botanical terminology wa s as sophisticated as any devised using the Linnaean system of nomenclature, in spite of Mooney's frustration with the naming process. There are inherent difficulties in determining and developing an historical ethnobotanical classification system. Informant s are often anonymous experts, and they are typically few in number. It is difficult to determine if their rendition of cultural knowledge was widely shared or the result of years of personal experience in their chosen field of expertise. The methodologies used to determine informant consensus (Trotter and Logan 1986, Romney et al. 1986, Handwerker 1998) are of limited use in an historical evaluation. Yet there appeared to be a level of consistency between the works of Mooney and Olbrechts, and, dispite so me overlap in the informant base, many of Mooney's informants had died prior to Ol brechts visit. Olbrechts made a conscious effort to maintain his independence by includi ng different informants from those used by Mooney (n.d. Ms. 4600). It is not until the work of Banks that we see the simplification of the system, mostly through the loss at the leve l of folk species and varietals. However, at the level of the folk genus, there appears to be a high level of consistency with the findings of Mooney and Olbrechts. It would appear that the folk genus is not only the first aspect to develop in an ethnobiological system (Berlin 1972), but also the most persistent aspect through the di ssipation of that system. Another problem is that the exact i dentification of the biological species under consideration is often unclear. In many instances throughout the text, I have questioned 39 the accuracy of botanical name associated with a Cherokee name. But much of this can be remedied with an intimate knowledge of t he regions' flora and careful examination of the meaning of the Cherokee name. Fo r instance, Olbrechts identified ts\u00e2liy\u00fast g\u00edgag\u00e9 a flowered species. Most members of the intermediate category ts\u00e2liy\u00fast were in the botanical genus Lobelia ; however, of the species common to the Southern Appalachian region, only Lobelia cardinalis has red flowers. This obvious misidentification was rectified by comparison with Mooney's notes, but others that were not as clear have been cited as a questionable throughout this text. Also, some of the botanical species correlated with a Cherokee name are not indigenous to the Southern Appalachian region. In those cases, I have proposed similar species as acceptable alternatives for obvious misidentifications. But in spite of the inherent difficult ies, the methodology used by Mooney and the contributions of subsequent researchers has produced a very intricate ethnobotanical classification system. These findings add suppor t to the premise that folk biological classification systems are a universal feat ure of human cognition (Berlin et al. 1973, Berlin 1992). Conklin (1954) is generally credited with developing one of the first ethnobotanical taxonomies (D'Andrade 1995: 92), but Mooney began his observations on the Cherokee system more than 60 years befor e Conklin's research. It is clear from what is known about Mooney that he was not l ooking for universals at the time of his research. The prevailing framework for anthropologi cal study at the Bureau of Ethnology during Mooney's employment as an ethnographer was the evolutionary theory of social development as described by Lewis Henr y Morgan. This theory was embraced and 40 promoted the Bureau's director, John Wesley Powell. Powell's commitment to the evolutionist stance would often cause hi m to devalue the importance of Mooney's research, referring to his findings about the C herokee as \"vestiges of an earlier system.\" Powell firmly believed that the study of \"survivals\" among American Indians using the comparative method of ethnology would hel p solve the \"Indian problem\" and provide scientific evidence that would help explain t he evolution of civilized man and his culture (Moses, 1984: 30). Mooney seemed to parrot the evolutionist theme in his early works and cited the inferiority of the Indian medical system and limited range of botanical knowledge among the medicine men (Mooney 1890b). But he al so accepted that the Cherokee had an elaborate religious system and that his work re futed earlier assumptions that \"the Indian had no religion except what they are pleased to call the meaningless mummeries of the medicine men\" (Hinsley, 1981: 212). Hudson credits Mooney with being one of the first anthropologists to realize that Native Americ ans did have a system of beliefs that were as consistent and complex as many world religions (Hudson, 1976:14). Mooney did not accept the prevailing attitude that domi nant cultures were somehow superior to suppressed cultures. In his eyes, loss of prestige and domination were products of history, not a sign of inferiority. Mooney did not accept that the premise of many evolutionists that decline of political infl uence and disrupted social patterns were a sign of \"moral failure\" (Hinsley, 1981: 207). Mooney's assertion that religious beliefs determined the daily lives of Indians in the same way that it did for many whites wa s not well received by his superiors at the Bureau of Ethnology. He caused them gr eat consternation when he compared the 41 Ghost Dance messianic movement to Christiani ty. They made every effort to mute his statements due to misgivings about the backl ash that the Bureau might suffer in the politically sensitive climate in Washingt on. Their fears turned out to be unfounded, and Mooney received high praises for the t horoughness of his research, his sympathy towards his subjects, and his conclusions about the nature of the native religions (Moses, 1984: 91-93). It was Mooney's activist approach toward Native American rights that led to his being reassigned to positions that did not include fieldwork. In 1888, he brought the plight of the Cherokee to the governm ent's attention and proposed measures to alleviate the problems on the reservat ion (Judd, 1967: 49). Mooney's sympathy towards the Indians and his disgust at the me thods of their forced enculturation put him in conflict with those who supported the cause of \"Indian advancement.\" After Mooney secured the release of a Cherokee friend's son from the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, the school's founder, Henry Pratt, considered Mooney an impediment to the assimilationist cause. Pratt event ually developed his case against Mooney and in 1918 had him barred from further research on rese rvations in light of his support of the use of peyote in Native American religious ceremonies (Moses, 1984: 86). Mooney's assertion to Professor G. Br own Goode that he was trying, \"to get at the Cherokee basis of classification\" (see In troduction) indicates that he believed in an inherent native system, unique to the Cherok ee. At the time he proposed this, more than 60 years before Conklin, there were no other models available to influence Mooney's thinking on how the Cherokee grouped kinds of things in their natural world. What is clear from Mooney's record of the Cherokee ethnobotanical system is that the 42 principles and structure inherent in the syst em that he found extant among the late 19th century Cherokee are congruent with contemporary models of ethnobiological classification systems. And, while it appear s that Mooney was searching for a unique system, congruency with contemporary models provides evidence for the contention that such systems are universal features of human cognition. 43 \u0083 Chapter 3 Tluk\u00fb - Tree The range of species diversity of the eastern woodlands culminates in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. This diversit y is due in part to a favorable climate and abundant rainfall in association with diverse soil types, variations in topography, and a wide range of microclimates (Randolph et al. 1999: 72). The resources associated with these forests were an essential component for survival in a land of limited agricultural potential. So it should come as no surprise that trees would play a significant role in the lives of the Eastern Cherokee. Trees woul d supply the Cherokee with food for humans, livestock, and game animals as well as prov iding building materials, fuel, and medicine. However, it was during Mooney's tenure as a researcher (1887-1917) that the Cherokee relationship with the forests went through its greatest transformation. Logging interests began buying large tracts of land in t he region in the 1890s and the Cherokee began selling logging rights on the reservati on starting around 1900 (Finger 1984: 11). The employment opportunities provided by the ti mber companies were the primary sources of wage labor available to the Cherokee in the first decades of the 20 th century. But by 1929, the majority of the large mills had s hut down and the corporate logging interests had pulled out of the region (Finger 1984: 54). This change in the physical environment did not appear to translate into an immediate loss of ethnobotanical knowledge. The Cherokee were a people of the 44 eastern woodlands, and their reliance on the forest resources was deeply embedded in their culture. Mooney may have worked among the Cherokee before the removal of the forests, but Olbrechts recorded considerably more medicinal uses for tree species than Mooney. This observation will be discussed below in my Re-evaluation of the Cherokee Ethnomedical System (Chapter 11). Witthoft (n.d .) also presented evidence of the value of trees to the material culture of the C herokee. All aspects of Cherokee life were influenced by the forests around them and, as will be seen below, trees played a prominent role in the Cherokee medical pharmacopoeia. The Cherokee relationship to the tree life forms appears to be represented it their classification system. As mentioned above, the relatively high percentage of opaque name associated with the taxa included in the tree life form category indicates the high degee of cultural salience attributed to the trees. There were 49 folk genera represented in the Cherokee data, 33 of which were labeled with opaque names. The 49 folk genera represent 66 botanical tree species (see Table 3. 3). However, it is form the relationship of monotypic to polytypic genera that we can speculate on the history of cultural salience within the tree life form. When considering the relationship of the botanical genera with the highest number of representative species included in the Cherokee system, patterns become apparent. Common species, such as the hickories and maples, are predominantly placed in polytypic folk genera (see Table 3.1). The hickories are all considered to be kinds of wan\u00e9 and one appears to be most prototypical due to the lack of a specific qualifier. But the poor association of the C herokee names with botanical species limits our understanding of hickory classification. The two large species of maples are 45 recognized as types of ts\u00fbnwagi , while Acer pensylvanica , a typically shrubby species (see Chapter 4), appears to be a taxonomic outli er. However, there is little linguistic evidence that the oaks, which comprise t he largest group of botanical species of the trees labeled by the Cherokee, are recogniz ed as being closely related (see Table 3.2). Table 3.1: Botanical and Cherokee Names for Maples and Hickories Botanical Name Cherokee Name Cherokee Gloss Maples Acer pensylvanicum 'small nuts' no gloss (see text) Table 3.2. Botanical and Cherokee Names for Oaks Botanical Name Cherokee Name Cherokee Gloss Q. prinus , being named for the size of their acorns, demonstrate a discernable linguistic relationshi p, but this does not appear to represent 46 a polytypic genera. It would appear from the linguistic evidence that the oaks are not affiliated in the Cherokee system in the same manner as the maples and hickories. However, the high number of opaque spec ies and monotypic genera in such an obviously related botanical genus may be repr esentative of the high degree of cultural salience formerly attributed to the oaks. The degree of reliance on acorns for sustenance in the Archaic and Woodland periods in the Southern Appalachians is not clearly understood and often controversial. Delcourt et al. (1986) found the highest percentage of acorns in nut remains in the Little Tennessee River Valley during the Early Archiac period (36%), but the percent diminished to less than 10% for the remainder of the Archiac and Woodland periods. But their pollen analysis shows a strong domi nance for oak trees in the area throughout both periods. Yarnell and Black (1985) adj usted the shell-to-food ratio from archaeological evidence, and claim that acorns comprised up to 75% of the nut food in the region until the switch to a reliance on co rn in the Mississippian Period. According to this model, hickory nuts made up the bulk of the archaeological remains from the region, but they only comprised around 20% of the total diet. Acorns would have been a more plentiful and reliable food source for Southeastern Natives. The evidence is strong for the use of fire to modify the Southeastern environment, which would resu lt in the predominance of oaks in the region. Oak trees are fire tolerant and in crease in areas of repeated burning (Delcourt and Delcourt 1997, 1998). Hickories, on the other hand, are relatively fire intolerant and would not have thrived in such conditions. Th is indicates that, after several generations of seasonal burning, acorns would be t he dominant nut in terms of quantity. 47 Acorns would also be a more reliable food product. White oaks and red oaks are divided in to two subgenera, the Leptobalanus (white) and Erythrobalanus (red). The acorns from the members of the Leptobalanus subgenera mature from flowers in a single season, while those in the Erythrobalanus mature the next year after flowering (Sork and Bramble 1993). As the quantity of fruit yield is environmentally determined (Sharp and Sprague 1967), a bad fruiting season would not affect both subgenera of the oaks. If the white oaks were decimated by a la te frost, the red oaks would still produce a crop based on the previous seasonal conditions. The difference in the yearly cycles of the two oak subgenera would decrease the lik elihood of a poor crop, suggesting a more reliable resource. The dependablilty of oaks as a food source and their pervasiveness in the Southern Appalachian region appears to have been reflected in the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system. Other relationships between botanical gener a also appear to be reflected it the Cherokee tree life forms. The genus Prunus is represented by four species, two cherries (Prunus serotina and P. pensylvanica ), a plum and the peach ( P. persica) . The two cherries were grouped together in the folk genus taya while the larger plum and peaches were known as kwna. The names reflect a finer distinction in the Cherokee perception of the members of the genus Prunus than that indicated by their botanical classification. However, trees with apple-like fruit were included in the folk genus s\u00fbnkt, which included representative taxa from the botanical genera Malus and Crataegus . The Cherokee perception of the folk genus s\u00fbnkt appears to be more inclusive than is indicated by botanical classification. 48 Some relationships have no apparent explanation. Why are the pines generally referred to as nats, yet Pinus strobus is singled out as t\u00e2tsk? Why do the Cherokee names for Juglans nigra (s\u00e9t) and J. cinera (kah), two very similar species, not reflect a perceptual relationship? Questions such as thes e are difficult to address in an historical work such as this and the answers may be lost with the original meanings of the names. Table 3.3. Tree Index: Botanical Species and Folk Genera Botanical Species Folk Genus Botanical Species Folk Genus - Juniperis virginiana L. - red cedar Mooney reported that the red cedar was, \"held sacred above all other trees\" by eastern tribes due to its evergreen habit, pleas ant smell, the color of its wood, and it resistance to decay (Mooney 1900: 421). It was used ceremonially as an incense and for diseases associated with dreams of ghosts (see aniskina g\u00f6wani ts\u00f6 ist\u00f6i ). By the time Olbrechts was among the Cherokee, it was remembered that it was once used medicinally, but the specifics of that use we re forgotten. He did find that the branches were used in a magic rite (not described) and the branches were used to make fish traps. ats\u00fbk g\u00fbnage - 'black smelling wood', lutea Michaux - yellow birch The second name for this species comes from Olbrechts, but he only glossed uyalem\u00f6 as 'rough bark' and no . However, Mooney recorded Betula as ats\u00fbk, stemming or 'wood' and s\u00fbk' or 'smelling', and atis\u00f6yi as Betula lutea , but it is highly unlikely that the yellow birc h, with a distinctly golden cast to the bark, would be the 'black smelling wood' and I am going to assume that this is actually B. lenta , a species with very dark bark. However, B. lutea does have what is referred to as a peely bark, and the rough appearance would provi de evidence that this is the species 50 to which Olbrechts was referring. Both ar e found in the mountains near the Cherokee reservation, but the yellow birch is found at the higher elevations. When a novice was a candidate to becom e a medicine man, he was required to take great pains to avoid any food prepar ed by a menstruating woman or touch an object she had touched. If this did occur, he would forget all that he had learned and be spoiled as a candidate. As a prophylactic to these nefarious influences, the novitiate would chew the inner bark of B. lenta and rub the juice over his heart area, or the \"place where the soul is\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 102). a remedy for uyous\u00f6 tsunineli\u00e7q ('disgusted by the sight of a corpse'), but, as mentioned above, it is not clear which species was actually used or if they were used in terchangeably. An infusion of the bark of B. lenta was also used alone in a ritual monthly emesis . It is not an emetic, but its pleasant taste probably eased the process and settled the stom ach. Olbrechts quoted his informant as saying they would take in \"as much as they can hold.\" This supposition on my part of the role of B. lenta in the emetic process is supported by Banks, who reported that it was used to settle the stomach (1953: 29). atsnki unega - 'white smelling wood' - Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr - eastern hemlock The phonetic spelling of atsnki is slightly different than that of the previous species, but this was from the plant labels and Mooney might not have had the opportunity to refine his notes. The name is appropriate, though, as T. canadensis is quite fragrant and the wood is very light in co lor. Neither Mooney or Olbrechts attributed any medicinal properties to this species, but Olbrechts did record several uses for T. 51 caroliniana (see nona below). The two species may be interchangeable, as their distribution is sympatric in the mount ains of North Carolina. Banks found T. canadensis used by the Cherokee and made no mention of T. caroliniana , other than to attribute a citation to Olbrechts which he mistakenly placed under the heading of T. canadensis . In his own research he found that the tips of the branches were made into a tea for kidney troubles and that the pounded bark could be used as a poultice for itchy armpits (1953: 7). dag\u00fbnage\u00ed - 'they are black' or 'blackwood' - Quercus velutina Lam. - black oak The Cherokee name here is evident for the same reason as the common English name; the bark of black oak is the darkest of the oaks. In Mooney's linguistic analysis for 'blackwood', he found that dag\u00fbnage\u00ed stemmed from t or 'wood' and \u00fbnage or 'black'. His informant indicated that da or d at the beginning of the name makes it specific as \"the black.\" This was one of se veral species combined for the treatment of wounds in cases such as adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by yigetsiyol\u00f6 they have been shot by a bullet or arrow)'. A decoction of the bark was also a remedy for a sore throat, an aching tooth, diarrhea, and to improve appetite. It was combined with Polygonum sagittatum and two unidentified plants for duletsi scarlet oak - Quercus coccinea Muenchh. Mooney included this in a list of Cherokee plants (Ms. 2235). There was no gloss or other information about this species. I am assuming it is an opaque, proper name. 52 d\u00e2wts\u00edla - fulva ) - slippery elm The Cherokee gloss is very fitting for a species known for the mucilaginous nature of its inner bark. The only uses fr om Olbrechts' notes was a reference to Ulmus rubra as part of a formula for a condition known as dawzni e i unit\u00f6y\u00f6; however, no gloss or description of this condition was included (see appendix). Other uses were included in The Swimmer Manuscript , though. D\u00e2wts\u00edla was made into a decoction , the roots and the cones of Pinus pungens to prepare a woman to give birth. The slippery elm was given to lubricate the passage for the child and ensure an easy birth (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 119). It was also used as part of the formula for amayi didatsoststi dinineld\u00f6 ('he is sick by the water'). Banks (1953: 34) also recorded that the steeped bark was used as a wash to heal burns. dawts\u00edliy\u00fasti - 'like d\u00e2wts\u00edla' - Ulmus americana L. - American elm While it may surprise those familiar with the elms that Ulmus rubra , the smaller species, is the more prototypical species here and Ulmus americana is designated as the 'like' or subordinate species, this is mo st likely due to the frequency of occurrence in the mountains. The range of Ulmus americana in the North Carolina mountains is restricted to the area around Swain County (Radford et al. 1968: 387) and it would appear that these were introduced to the region. No medicinal uses were recorded for this species. 53 d\u00edligalsk - 'it peels to the bark' - Salix spp . - willow Mooney recorded this gloss for the willows, which stems from or d\u00edligalsk as 'they strip themselves'. Both appear to be due to the habit of the bark of the willows, whic h peels easily from the stem. Mooney and Olbrechts noted two species used by the Cherokee, Salix humilis Marshall and Salix alba L., but difficulties with field ident ification of the species of the genus Salix may have led to misidentification. Salix humilis is the only common species of Salix without serrations on the leaf margin found in the North Carolina mountains, and this is probably one of the species used by the Cherokee. The labels identified by the Smithsonian botanists support this speculation (Mooney Ms. 2591). But Salix alba , a species with a serrated margins and densely hairy undersides to the leaves, is not common in the mountains and was an introduced species. The most common of the Salix species that fits the above description and is found in the region is Salix sericea Marshall, and I would presume that this is the species most frequently used by the Cherokee (Radford et al. 1968: 387). But without a voucher spec imen, this can not be verified. I will use Salix alba in the remainder of this description as it was the species discussed by Mooney and Olbrechts, but the reader s hould maintain a degree of skepticism concerning the exact species. The medical applications and ethnobotanical classification were deeply intertwined in the case of d\u00edligalsk. At the level of the folk generic, any d\u00edligalsk could be used with Prunus serotina for a severe cold that resulted in laryngitis or for andlk\u00f6\u00e7a yunalstune\u00e7a ('if their urine is stopped'). At t he level of folk species, the two biological species were associated with several synonyms. Salix alba was known as 54 d\u00edligalsk utana , utana amayu tei or 'it peels to growing by the water', and d\u00edligalsk ustiga gey\u00f6e\u00e7i or 'it peels to the bark, small, gr owing by the river'. The last gloss is anomalous due to it being described as a 'small' variety, which would support the argument that it was actually S. sericea . The medicinal uses for S. alba are as varied as the names given to it. It was added to Morus rubra , ('big chill'). It was one of the alter native ingredients in the formula for unakewag\u00f6i ('if they lost their voice'). It was included in one of many formulas for eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss), a condition typified many urinary conditions, the plants should all have their roots growing in water. It was also combined with S. humilis for the condition gotisgi tsunits\u00f6y\u00f6i ('when their stomach is swollen'), a condition that occurs when the food in the stomach was changed by a witch or a conjurer . Salix alba was combined with an unidentified plant tsunigatogi , or 'snake odor', the sight of a corpse'). And it was used alone for aniskina g\u00f6wanits\u00f6 ist\u00f6i ('when they have been made sick humilis was known 'the small d\u00edligalsk growing on the hillside'. One of the common names for this species, the tall prairie willow (Petrides 1986: 250), suggests that it is less dependent on a constant water source and would fare quite nicely on a well-drained Southern Appalachian hillside. Olbrechts recorded it as digalulegi , but did not provide a gloss for this name. Other than the use mentioned above in combination with S. alba , S. humilis was used by itself as a 55 remedy for a condition known as 'bones coming out', which was not clarified but may be a severe case of did\u00f6lesgi ('the crippler'), a type Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal This also comes from a list of Cherokee names matched with botanical species (Ms. 1894). Witthoft (n.d.: 35) verified that th is is an opaque, proper name. He also said that it was quite rare on the Cherokee rese rvation an insignificant as a food product. No medicinal uses for pawpaw were attributed to the Cherokee. g\u00e1glanah\u00edta - 'hanging down long' - Salix babylonica L. - weeping willow The name g\u00e1glanah\u00edta ('hanging down long') is the same as the word used to describe someone with long hair; however, it is applied only to soft things. No medicinal application was attributed to this introduced species. gasotegwalega - 'small abdomen' - Quercus bicolor Willd. - swamp white oak This identification is highly unl ikely, as the distribution of Q. bicolor is limited to the Piedmont region of North Carolina. As the oaks are known to hybridize, it is possible that the specimen he found was a hybrid between Q. prinus and another species of white oak (Radford et al 1968: 374). Olbrechts also gave tsisotegwalega as a synonym for gasotegwalega , but gave no explanation for the et ymology of either name. He recorded that it was used in the formula for un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc e\u00e7a ('when their Quercus nigra L. (Q. aquatica ) - water oak The name stems from g\u00fal or 'acorn' and \u00e9gwa or 'large', which brings its identification into question, as the acorns for Q. nigra are fairly small and the high mountain areas are outside of its range. T he original identification my have been a hybrid species that was misidentified as Q. nigra or this could be black oak, Q. velutina , that was referred to as \"nigra\", meaning black. No further information was given for this species. gule tsunstiga - 'small acorns' - Quercus imbricaria Michaux - shingle oak The acorns for Q. imbricaria are between 1 and 1 \u00bd cm long (Radford et al. 1968: 382)), hence the basis for the Cher okee name. Mooney called this species tsugw\u00fbnstts\u00e2l or 'leaves tapering', but he also identified Q. rubra by the same name, so this could have been a misidentification. The leaves of Q. imbricaria do not taper. The only recorded medicinal use was for the bark as an alternative for Q. falcata in the formula for the condition known as unakewag\u00f6i ('if they lost their voice') (Mooney - nigra L. The range of Betula nigra is limited in the mountains of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 368) and it seems unlikely that this is the species that was available to the Cherokee. However, both Mooney and Olbrec hts recorded it as a Cherokee plant and both identified it as g\u00fbnetiski. Banks also included it in his work, providing more evidence for its presence among and use by the Cherokee. G\u00fbnetiski appears to be an 57 opaque, proper name. This assumption is also supported by Banks' research (1953: 29). Olbrechts found that B. nigra was used by itself or in the formula for un\u00f6di tsandiku\u00e7a ('they urinate all milk') (M ooney and Olbrechts 1932: 200). Banks added the use of the bark sap (inner bark?) as a t ea to alleviate loose bowels (1953: or Tilia americana L. I included both pronunciations of the Cherokee name for this species because of the variation between Mooney's and Olbrechts' versions. Tilia heterophylla is the most common species of basswood in the North Carolina mountains, but T. americana was the species that both Mooney and Olbrechts identified as ideh\u00fb. While T. americana is rare in North Carolina, it is found in Swain County, the home of the largest portion of the Cherokee Reservation. The two species are very similar and Banks (1953: 87) suggested that the Cherokee do not distinguish between the two. Olbrechts recorded two uses for ideh\u00fb. It was used for a type of diarrhea that was attributed to animals, known as atawini ei or 'the forest dwellers'. Women would drink a decoction of the bark as soon as they found out they were pregnant. This was done every month until they delivered the child because the bark is slippery, like that of slippery elm (see d\u00e2wts\u00edla above), and aids in the birthing process. Banks attributes a use to the notes of Mooney, which he acquired from Witthoft, stating that the juice from chewed bark from a lightening struck tree was rubbed on a snakebite. I did not come across this reference in my searches. He also found that the 58 beaten bark was used as a poultice for boils and that the bark was a component in a decoction used for tuberculosis caused by conjuring (see kutl\u00fb below) (1953: 86-87). kah - butternut - Juglans cinera L. Kah appears to be an opaque, proper name for butternut. The inner bark was used as a cathartic (Witthoft 1947), while an infusion of several used to draw the pus out of an infected tooth (Banks 1953: 26). The edible nut was used in Cherokee cooking (Perry 1974: 42). Accounts from the early 19 th century suggest that the oil of black walnuts was extracted in much the same way as that from hickory nuts (see wan\u00e9 below), but the informant had never seen the operation performed (Payne n.d.: 157). Contemporary experiments with the extr action of oil from walnuts and butternuts have shown that bits of the husks are trapped in the rough outer shell of the nut and that pounding and boiling creates an inedible, bitter product (Talalay et al. 1984: 354). This would suggest that the Cherokee may have used a more labor intensive means to extract walnut oil and that this was not the preferred nut for oil extraction. kn\u00fbst - flowering dogwood - Cornus florida L. Kn\u00fbst appears to be an opaque, proper name. This is one of the few tree species highlighted by Mooney. In one of his random notes, he states that this is a \"noted medicine\" and that the inner bark wa s boiled for dysentery and a decoction of dogwood and black oak barks ( Quercus velutina ) was drunk for sore throats. The bark of dogwood was harvested from the east side of the tree. 59 Olbrechts added a wide range of applications for C. florida . It was part of the formula for the form of cancer known ('if they water out white'). He included it in a formula fo r severe diarrhea (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 283) and found it was used alone for chicken pox or any condition that produced boils on the skin. The chewed bark was spat on spider bites and a decoction of the bark was used as a remedy for poison ivy. For poison ivy part of the decoction is drunk and part sprinkled on the rash, but the sprinkling must occur after a portion has been drunk or the rash will be driven into the body. Banks also found that dogwood was used for dermatological conditions (1953: 96). A tea of the bark was taken alone or decocted with Prunus serotina and Lindera benzoin as a remedy for measles. The decoction was added to corn whiskey to break out the rash. The bark of an old tree was made into a decoction to bathe one suffering from chicken pox, clearing up the outbreak that same day. The bark was chewed for headaches and the flower petals were boiled and drunk for colds. k\u00fblkw\u00e9gti - 'to use as a bow' - Robinia pseudoacacia L. - black locust This species was apparently named for its use in the making of a hunting bow. King (1976) said that Robinia pseudoacacia and Gleditsia triacanthos were the preferred woods for bows, but that Platanus occidentalis and Carya spp . were also acceptable. Witthoft 149) stated unequivocally that R. pseudoacacia and G. triacanthos were the only woods used in traditional Cherokee bows. Medicinally, it was 60 used for uyos\u00f6\u00e7i e isti tsanan\u00e7tatia ('when they suffer painful locust and Olbrechts recorded as an opaque, proper name for honey locust. Olbrechts recorded several medicinal uses for G. triacanthos . The sweet pods could be used in place of honey to sweeten unpalatable medicines, such as the harsh medicines used for worms (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 249). It was a component in the formula for unitseno iseoi ('when a person has stomach trouble') and suffer painful remembrances of the dead'). K\u00fbls\u00e9ts was used with others to make an emetic used to throw off spoiled saliva (see dunikstisg\u00f6i in the appendix for a discussion on spoiled saliva). It was one of the plants used to prepare ball players for the match, the wood of honey locust being burnt with that of a lightening struck tree that was not killed and used to paint designs on the contestan t. It was believed that such a treatment would make the ball player's flesh, \"as har d and firm to the touch as the wood of honey locust (Mooney 1890a).\" Banks (1953: 71) wa s told that a tea from the bark of G. triacanthos or Crataegus spp . would help ball players repel tacklers because no one would want to run into the sharp spines of ei ther. He also reported that a tea of the pods was used for measles and that the bark of honey locust was combined with the leaves of Tovaria virginiana and the hot tea given to patients with whooping cough (1953: 72). The pods were also once prepared as a beverage. The dried pods were crushed and placed in a vessel with water. This was set in a warm spot until the sweet flavor 61 was imparted to the drink. Hotter water wa s later added to extract all remnants of the sweet pulp (Payne n.d.: opaque, proper name for S. albidum . Olbrechts recorded several medicinal applications fo r sassafras, but none were included in the published materials and the material on preparation and application was scanty. The leaves and bark were chewed and the juice spat on spider bites. It was brewed for all types of diarrhea and as a remedy for scrofula. It was combined with Pinus pungens and Bovista pila for the purple form of the cancer known as adayeski . He also said it was used for a condition known as \"when they are shaking with fever\", possibly a form of unawasti egwa ('big chill'). Mooney, in one of his few references to the medicinal properties of trees, recorded the use of the barks sassafras, Carpinus caroliniana of Hexastylis arifolia for cancer and old sores. Banks also found S. albidum used for diarrhea, but he added several more applications to Olbrechts' findings. The r oot tea was drunk as a blood builder, for headaches and colds, as a poultice for sprains and bruises, and as a favored beverage. The pith of the young twigs was made into a cold eyewash for any type of sore eyes, including conditions such as sties or pink eye (1953: 53). Along with its use as a beverage, Perry (1974: 45) recorded that t he roots could be chewed to dispel the personal odor that accompanies eating ramps. She was told that there are two varieties of sassafras roots, but that the red r oots were superior to the white roots. 62 kutl\u00fb or kus\u00fb - beech - Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. ( F. americana ) This was apparently an opaque, proper nam e for beech. Neither Mooney or Olbrechts recorded a medicinal use for beech, but Banks (1953: 32) acquired two formulas. An infusion of Quercus and Tilia was used for a type of tuberculosis that was due to conjuring. Another formula was for \"bad disease\", a condition that typically involved a high fever. It consisted of a combination of F. of which were made into an infusion and drunk by the patient. kuw\u00fb - mulberry - Morus rubra L. Kuw\u00fb appears to be an opaque, proper name for M. rubra . Olbrechts recorded two uses for it; combined with a species of Salix it was used unawasti egwa ( 'big chill') and with Panax quinquefolium it was used for chest pains. The berry was one of the favorite ingredients in Cherok ee corn bread (Witthoft n.d.: occidentalis L. - sycamore The designation kuwiyust is not a definite indication that the Cherokee considered this a folk species of kuw\u00fb as the suffix - iyus ('like') can represent perceived similarities that are not necessarily classificatory relationships, such as the leaves of plants that resemble ferns being referred to as ig\u00fbliyusti ('fern-like'). However, 63 Mooney recorded both kuwiyust and kuw\u00fb unega for P. occidentalis and Olbrechts recorded an unidentified botanical species as kuw\u00fb unega. However, the name kuw\u00fb unega would indicate that this is a white species of kuw\u00fb and that the Cherokee perceived a classificatory relationship between the two trees. As the bark, leaves, and buds of the two species are quite differ ent from each other, it appears that the relationship is due to the similarity of the fruits. Both have a pendulous aggregate fruit and, while that of P. occidentalis is dry and inedible, the visual similarities would indicate that it is was considered a species of Morus rubra . Witthoft (n.d.: 148) claims that both names are due to the resemblance of the whole tree to Morus rubra , but the differences mentioned above cast doubt on this assertion. Another possible explanation is that the introduced Morus alba L., or white mulberry, was also known to the Cherokee and this is the species that was known as kuw\u00fb unega. Radford et al. indicate that it is now a widely scattered species, but it is not on their distribution maps in the mount ains of North Carolina (1968: 390). Hamel and Chiltoskey (1975: 45) also mention it as a medicinal, but it is included in the same reference as Morus rubra and no distinction is made betw een the two. Without voucher specimens, it is impossible to resolve the identity of kuw\u00fb unega. For the purposes of this work, the medicinal uses attributed to kuw\u00fb unega will be included with others for P. occidentalis . Platanus occidentalis appears in several formulas in The Swimmer Manuscript , where it was attributed to a wide range of conditions such as utigad\u00f6 ('to 64 and Olbrechts 1932: 126, 200, 244, 246). Olbrec hts also included several applications for P. occidentalis in his notes, used alone or in a formula, for Cherokee ethnomedical conditions including egwa ('big chill'). For the discharge of yellow urine, a special type of root was required and it was designated by the name kuwiyust amayi tsunastun\u00f6i or 'the sycamore with its roots in the water'. Witthoft (n.d.: 148) found that the inner bark was steeped in water and the infusion applied to sores on the skin that resembled the scaly, variegated bark of the sycamore. He also found that the roots gr owing in water were beaten and steeped, the resulting infusion used to wash the genital lesions due to venereal disease. kwna - peach - Prunus persica (L.) Batsh Mooney speculated superceded the wild plum ( Prunus americana ) as the folk generic kwna, due to its rapid assimilation and status as a relished food crop for the Cherokee after its introduction by the Spanish. Olbrechts reported that it was used medicinally with Aristolochia serpentaria for scrofula and alone for a type of heartburn attributed to \"the in sects living in the water\". For the latter condition, all juicy fruits and vegetables were avoided during treatment. Banks (1953: 63) confirmed this use, finding that a tea m ade of the bark in cold water was used for a \"sick stomach\". He also found that cold bar k tea was used to ease the pain of piles and to stop vomiting, while a hot infusion was used as a cough medicine. For the bark to work correctly as an anti-emetic, the knife used to harvest the bark must slice upwards, 65 while for bowel conditions it must slice dow nwards, both representing the direction of movement of the condition. The Cherokee relished peaches as a food crop and peach orchards were noted by several 18 th century observers (Goodwin 1977: 127). To preserve the peaches, the pit and skin were removed, the flesh pounded in a mortar, and the resulting pulp was made into cakes and dried in the sun (Payne n.d.: 156). kwna unsd\u00edga - 'little peach' Marsh. - wild plum Unsd\u00edga or usd\u00ed is the irregular form of tsund\u00edga , the regular plural form for 'small'. Only the plural form was used when referring to Prunus americana . Mooney speculated that this was the original kwna, being renamed as the small variety after the introduction of the peach by the Spanish (see kwna). No medicinal uses were recorded for this species, which was probabl y an oversight as all other species of Prunus have multiple applications (see taya gadusie i below). nats - pine or natsuya - Virginia pine; Pinus rigida Miller - pitch pine There are classification problems wi th the pines stemming from either misidentification by the researchers or a lack of differentiation among the Cherokee. Nats appears to be an opaque, proper name and is applied as the generic term for all pines (excluding Pinus strobus , see t\u00e2tsk below). However, natsuya or the 'true pine', that pine dem onstrating the most prototypical 66 qualities of the pines, while Olbrechts matched natsuya with P. pungens . Conspicuously absent from the notes of both Mooney and Olbrechts was P. virginiana , which was the most prominent medicinal pine in Banks' work. Complicating the matter even further was a note from one of the botanists with whom Mooney had collaborated determining that a sample of nats was P. rigida . Olbrechts identified nats simply as Pinus spp ., indicating the generic aspect of the term and leading me to the conclusion that the Cherokee did not differentiate the pines into folk species. The ambiguity surrounding the pines continues in the reports of their medicinal applications. When he identified the specie s, Olbrechts exclusively referred to P. pungens as the pine used medicinally by the Cher okee, such as its use in the formula for amayi didatsoststi dinineld\u00f6 ('to take pregnant women to the water') and Olbrechts 1932: 119). Other uses for P. pungens from his notes included severe cases of cancer or gangrene known as adayeski tsunit \u00f6yi they have itching'). Olbrechts also published generic uses for the pines. Cherokee homes were smudged by burning pine branches after the burial of a recently deceased family member. The belief was that the evergreen quality of pines was symbolic of long life and the smell would eliminate the re mnants of death and disease (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 139). A decoction made from t he tops pine trees was also used for the condition sent by conjurers known as ayeligogi uniyel\u00f6 n\u00f6\u00e7i it') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 188). 67 Banks found that a tea of the needles from P. echinata was used as cough remedy (1953: 5), but the majority of his findings concerned P. virginiana . A tea of the roots was used for sore throats while the st eam from a tea of the needles could be used for as a cold remedy. Tea of the buds and needles was used to ease diarrhea or as an anti-tussive. A hot decoction of pine needles, Hamamelis virginiana , and Lindera benzoin was given to a patient to cause a fever to break. Pine needles were placed in apple juice with Vicia caroliniana to prevent fatigue of ball players. The roots of pine were combined with those of Alnus serrulata and a species of dewberry ( a remedy caroliniana Engelm. Nona appears to be an opaque, proper name and a folk generic for both species of hemlock, Olbrechts applying it to T. caroliniana and Banks to T. canadensis . Mooney also canadensis as ats\u00fbnki unega or 'white smelling wood', indicating a name based on the two organoleptic qualities of sight and smell. Olbrechts recorded two medicinal applications for nona ; utigad\u00f6 ('to drive out afterbirth') and adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by wood'). Banks added that a tea from the tips of the stems was used for kidney problems and the pounded bark was used as a poultice for itchy armpits (1953: 7). n\u00fbd\u00e2gweja - sourwood - Oxydendrum arboreum (L.) DC N\u00fbd\u00e2gweja appears to be an opaque, proper name for sourwood. Sourwood played a prominent role in Cherokee myths. When the daughter of the Sun was killed by 68 a conjured rattlesnake, she was retrieved fr om the land of the dead by by seven men, each carrying a short rod of sourwood. W hen they touched the spirit of the daughter with the rods, she fell down and left the circle of the dancing dead. She was then placed in a box and taken back to her mother (Mooney 1900: 253). The role of sourwood is not explained, but it appears that the twigs had the power to restore life to the dead. Sourwood stakes were also used to pin the stone man to the ground after he had been made weak by coming into contact with se ven menstruating women. He then had large logs piled on him and as the fire approac hed he shared his medicine knowledge with the bystanders (Mooney 1900: 320). The wood of sourwood was also used to barbecue meat as its flavor was transferred to the meat, but it was not used for firewood because the ashes would cause the cook to become ill (Mooney 1900: 422). The wood also had a prophylactic power against the spells of witches (Mooney 1900: 469). The straight twigs of sourwood were included in formulas for stopped urination because it was thought that they would stra ighten out twisted urinary passages that caused the blockage (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 222). Olbrechts found that it was also included in a formula for another urinary condition, uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white'), as well as being included in a formula for a type of severe diarrhea (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 283). Banks reported t hat the bark scraped off of young shoots, used in combination with the leaves, was used for diarrhea and a decoction of the bark was added to baths for the itch (1953: 100- 101). Witthoft claimed that sourwood was considered one of the \"great medicines\" of the Cherokees, not for unique or spectacular conditions, but because a tea of the bark was applied to such common problems as thrush and diarrhea of infants and children (n.d.: 145-146). 69 sal - persimmon - Diospyros virginiana L. Sal appears to be an opaque, proper name for persimmon. Persimmon appears in a few different contexts in The Swimmer Manuscript , such as for part of the remedy for bloody flux (1932: 275) and as part of a multi-bark decoction given for uyalotisga ('if there is swelling') (1932: 298). A stam per made of persimmon wood was used to massage patients suffering from rheumatic pains, although the reason for selecting persimmon wood was forgotten by the time of Olbrechts' research (1932: 293). The unpublished materials suggest that D. virginiana was a popular remedy for a wide range of ethnomedical conditions including adayeski ('eating \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss), and gan\u00e7awad\u00f6\u00f6ski ('blisters caused by heat'). Banks found that the bark was chewed for heartburn and combined with the infusion for toothaches (1953: 104). The tea would be held in the mouth, causing the infection to come to a head. Witthoft found that the fruit from select ed trees was eaten fresh, but other means to store the fruit for later consumption had been forgotten (n.d.: 49). However, older accounts describe how pulp was processed for storage. The seeds were removed and the fruit pulp pounded in a mortar, formed into flattened cakes, and dried in the sun on a drying rack (Payne n.d.: 156). s\u00e9t - black walnut - Juglans nigra L. S\u00e9t appears to be an opaque, proper name for the black walnut. In addition to s\u00e9t, Olbrechts also recorded wanduya as another proper name for J. nigra , but Mooney 70 attributed this name to Carya glabra (Miller) Sweet. No clarification could be obtained from the notes of either m an or subsequent researchers. The nuts of J. nigra were taboo for pregnant women for fear that the child would have a large, broad nose (Mooney and Olbrecht s 1932: 121). Also, the wood of walnut was not used as firewood because the inner bar k was yellow, and if the ashes from it were used to cook corn gruel, it would cause a yellow discharge to emanate from the person who consumed it (Mooney 1890b). Ol brechts found that the bark was used medicinally for uiyugwatisgi ('he has a toothache') and the urinary tract affliction known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss). He also recorded that wanduya was used for spoiled appetite and for saliva that was spoiled by dreams, but the ambiguity associated with the identification of wanduya must be considered here. Banks was told that the bark, a known fish poison, was too toxic to use as medicine, but another informant said that the inner bark was a remedy for smallpox ( 1953: 26). The edible nut was a component in Cherokee bean bread (Perry 1974: 43). Accounts from the early 19th century suggest that the oil of black walnuts was extracted in much the same way as that from hickory nuts (see wan\u00e9 below), but the informant had never seen the operation performed (Payne n.d.: 157). It is unlikely that black walnuts were processed in this way for reasons discussed earlier (see kah above). s\u00fbnkt - apple - Malus pumila Miller ( Pyrus malus ) The notes concerning the various species of apple and related plants are somewhat confusing. For instance, Olbrechts distinguishes between malus (L.) Britt. and Pyrus malus same Cherokee species as Malus coronaria . With the materials between researc hers and in their individual work in conflict, I will present the materials here as they were recorded in their notes and the reader will need to be aware that the associat ion of an exact species with its description or medicinal use is tenuous at best. S\u00fbnkt appears to be an opaque name for the apples and the generic name for apples and trees that bear apple-like fruit. But like kwna it seems that the introduced apple became the prototype and the smaller native species were designated as folk species. Apples appeared to reach the Cherokee soon after their introduction by the Spanish (Goodwin 1977: 58). To avoid further confusion and because the voucher specimens are absent or nearly impossible to locate, I will present the species and their uses as they have been recorded by the researchers. The primary medicinal use for s\u00fbnkt found by Olbrechts was in a combination , Cornus florida , and Nyssa sylvatica as a remedy for cancer. No directions for preparation or application of th is remedy were included. He also found that the bitter variety was used with others for unakewag\u00f6i ('if they lost their voice'). Banks (1953: 65) found that the bark of s\u00fbnkt was used by ball players, a cold infusion of the bark and the outer layer of a corn stalk combined to allay a dry throat. Apple juice was also infused with the stem of Vicia caroliniana and the needles of Pinus virginiana to increase the ball players' endurance. - 'wilderness dwelling coccinea hawthorne or Malus coronaria (L.) Miller - crab-apple The name stems from s\u00fbnkt or 'apple', \u00ednge or 'a wilderness', and anh, the plural form of h, which glosses as 'dwelling' or 'growing'. Mooney's identification of this species as Crataegus coccinea is questionable, as this is an uncommon species of Crataegus that is rarely found outside of the Piedmont region. The genus is considered botanically difficult and this was probably C. flabellata , a very similar species more commonly found in the mountains. Malus coronaria is found in the North Carolina mountains and could have been the species used by the Cherokee. This could also be the s\u00fbnkt uiy\u00f6sti or 'bitter apples' mentioned above, as Olbrechts recorded a Cherokee synonym for this species as s\u00fbnkttsunsti , which may be a short form of tsuny\u00fbst ('bitter'). Besides its inclusion in the cancer re medy mentioned above, an infusion of the bark and fruit of M. coronaria was drunk by ball players. The purpose for this was not explained. tl\u00fb or tala - white oak - Quercus alba L. Tl\u00fb appears to be an opaque, proper name for the white oak. The range of uses attributed to it indicate that it was an important component of Cherokee life. Mooney noted that the white oak acorn was the favored acorn for making acorn bread (gul\u00e9 g\u00e1t). Olbrechts recorded several medicinal uses, including as a component of the formulas for atawini eI (the forest dwellers), dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a (yellow urine), eisti andik\u00f6\u00f6i (painful urination), and another condition that consisted of sores that burst, 73 possibly yig\u00f6waninil\u00f6\u00f6ski ('when they have suint'). He also noted that the inner bark was used to make baskets. Witthoft (n.d.: 54) reported that the acorns of white oak were coarsely crushed in a mortar, thoroughly par ched, pulverized further, and then boiled to be used as a coffee substitute. t\u00e2tsk - white pine - Pinus strobus L. T\u00e2tsk appears to be an opaque, proper name. Mooney gave both t\u00e2tsk (from Middle Cherokee) and t\u00e2ts (from Upper Cherokee) as versions of this name. It is morphologically different than t he other members of the genus Pinus , having flexible needles in bundles of five instead of stiff needles in bundles of 2 to 3, which may explain why it was not included in the folk genus of nats. None of the researchers recorded any medicinal uses for P. strobus and it is not known if it was used in the same way as the nats. taya or gitahya - wild cherry - Prunus serotina Ehrhart, Prunus virginiana L. Taya appears to be a proper, opaque name for the wild cherry, but there is some confusion over the botanical spec ies represented by the name. Olbrechts identified both P. serotina and P. virginiana L. as taya, and he recorded other synonyms for P. virginiana , but this is a shrubby species that is rare in North Carolina and only found in two mountain counties, nei ther contiguous to the Cherokee lands (Radford et al. 1968: 568). Olbrechts also exhi bits this confusion in his notes, citing names that can be a combination of P. virginiana , P. pensylvanica L., or P. serotina. Banks (1953: 64), while adding several used for P. serotina , only attributes uses of P. 74 virginiana to Olbrechts. While I am doubtful that the species encountered by Olbrechts was P. virginiana , I will discuss that species when he identifies it as one used exclusively for a Cherokee ethnomedical condi tion. When two species are identified as possible botanical species that match up with a Cherokee name, I will refer to the species that is common to the region and assume that P. virginiana was a misidentification. Mooney recorded wild cherry bark as the main treatment for the intermittent fevers known as unawasti egwa ('big chill'). The bark was beaten, placed in water with seven coals that heated the decoction, and blown on the body of the patient (1891: 362). As P. virginiana , Olbrechts found it was a component for another formula for unawasti egwa (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 277), as they and Olbrechts 1932: 297). In his notes he also reported it used for, swollen testicles, a condition described only as \"when heat caused it\", for a form of diarrhea when combined with Alnus serrulata and another unidentified plant. Banks (1953: 64) found that the Cherokee, like the mountain whites, used cherry bark for all the symptoms associated with cold s and the flu, as well as other conditions. A decoction, cooked down until it was thick, was taken for coughs. Combined with Clethra acuminata , it was employed to break a high fever. Mixed with the barks of Lindera benzoin and Cornus florida , it was made into a decoction, added to corn whiskey, and given to a patient to cause t he rash from measles to appear on the skin's surface. A decoction of the bark was given to break up the congestion that accompanied a cold. A tonic formula, used to strengthen the blood, consisted of P made into a decoction and several swallows were taken before meals to improve the appetite. taya gadusie i - 'the cherry that grows in the mountains' and kwanustiga - 'little peach' - Prunus pensylvanica L. - pin cherry The name taya gadusie i is quite appropriate for this species, as it is only found in the high mountain counties of North Ca rolina (Radford et al. 1968: 567); however, Mooney connected the name kwanustiga to Prunus americana . Whether this is a misidentification or a case of synony my cannot be determined without voucher specimens. Careful reading of The Swimmer Manuscript indicates that the formula for unawasti egwa ('big chill') contained taya gadusie i, as P. virginiana (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 276). Also, it was included in the formula for gig\u00f6 dig\u00f6guski ('when they discharge blood from their bowels'), but recorded as kwanustiga , so this may have actually been Prunus americana (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 275). Olbrechts' notes provide a much br oader range of application toward Cherokee ethnomedical conditions for P. pensylvanica than is indicated by the published material. It was used in formulas for the scrofulous condition known as duletsi ('kernels'), the lung disease ganedzi \u00f6\u00e7a and as unal\u00f6tel\u00f6 ('they have fits'). 76 til - (Marsh.) Borkh. ( C. americana ) Til appears to be a proper, opaque name for the American chestnut. Mooney and Olbrechts provided surprisingly little in formation on a species that was once so prominent in the Southern Appalachi an region. Olbrechts reported that C. dentata was used for the condition known as 'when they dream of all sorts of things', but did not clarify the condition. It may be a form of anskits\u00f6'\u00f6 sk\u00f6i ('whenever they dream (of...)'). However, Banks, even though he did his research in the years after the chestnut blight had decimated the larger trees, found a wide r ange of medicinal and material uses for the American chestnut (1953: 30-31). The new leaves were used to help heal old sores, while year old, dried leaves were made in to a decoction for heart trouble. A decoction of the leave of C. dentata and Verbascum thapsus , mixed with honey or brown sugar, was used a cough remedy. A small amount of a cold infusion of the bark of C. dentata and a species of Aesculus was taken by women who had recently birthed to stop bleeding and cramping. An infusion of the bark was used for a type of tuberculosis that was due to conjuring (see kutl\u00fb - Fagus grandifolia , was drunk for \"monthly female trouble\". The inclusion of Q. nigra in this formula is questionable, as it is rare in the mountains (Radford et al. 1968: 382). While Banks said the nuts were ground into flour and added to bread, Witthoft said that the chestnuts were never ground like acorns, but cut into pieces, boiled, and the nuts and stock mixed with cornmeal to make bread (Witthoft n.d.: 47-48). Witthoft also reported that t he nuts were roasted whole and eaten or boiled and added to soup. He also found that they could be used in place of acorns as a coffee substitute (see tl\u00fb above). An earlier account also m entions the extraction of oil from 77 chestnuts in much the same manner as from hickory nuts (see wan\u00e9 below) except that the nuts were hulled and dried before the extraction process (Payne n.d.: 174). tsilal or tsill - sweet gum - Liquidambar styraciflua L. Tsilal appears to be a proper, opaque name fo r sweetgum. Neither Mooney nor Olbrechts recorded a medicinal use for L. styraciflua , but Banks (1953: 58) included it in the formula he found for \"bad disease\" (see kutl\u00fb - Fagus grandifolia , above). Witthoft (1947), in an edited version of an early 19th century text, noted that the gum of L. styraciflua was used as a drawing plaster and the inner bark was made into a tea for calming nerves. He also reported it to be one of the barks used with Nyssa sylvatica in a multi-bark - L. Mooney recorded both names for Q. prinus , but did not include a gloss or the etymology for either name. No further menti on is made of this species in any of the Cherokee ethnobotanical literat ure, which I find strange for a common upland species with some of the largest acorns among the region's white oaks. This species may have been confused with other species of oaks (see guln\u00e9gwa - Q. nigra above). tsiyu - tulip poplar - Liriodendron tulipifera L. Tsiyu appears to be an opaque, proper name for tulip poplar. In his notes, Olbrechts indicated that the Cherokee held a high regard for the healing properties of L. tulipifera , \"The bark of this tree is used in most \"chirurigical\" treatments; wherever 78 bruises or cuts, arrows or bullet wounds have to be treated and infusion of poplar-bark is held to be a sovereign remedy.\" This was supported in is notes with its inclusion in the formula for adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by wood'). In The Swimmer Manuscript , he reported that L. tulipifera was used for gotisgi tsunits\u00f6y\u00f6i ('when their stomach is swollen') (1932: 298) and as an acceptable substitute for Aristolochia serpentaria for itchy genitals due to urinating on the fire ( 1932: 286). A decoction of the bark or root of tulip poplar could also be used as a substitute for Botrychium virginianum as a remedy for a poisonous snakebite, the decoction blown over the patient and rubbed on the actual bite (1932: 177). The decoction of t he bark was also blown over fractured bones (1932: 71). In his notes, he indicated that L. tulipifera was used in the formula for the urinary condition known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss) and for swelling of the neck. Banks (1953: 50) added that the bark from the roots was made into an infusion and drunk for indigestion and a decoction of the bark was drunk for bowel trouble. The bark was added to homemade medicines as a preservative and the inner bark scraped off, dried in the oven, and a small quantity ta ken for pinworms. And an infusion of the bark of L. tulipifera and several other barks was used for tuberculosis due to conjuring (see kutl\u00fb - Fagus grandifolia rubra L. - red oak Mooney did not explain this gloss, other than to mention that the \" ts\" at the beginning designates the plural form. It is not obvious from looking at the leaf why the Cherokee considered the taper a salient feat ure. Olbrechts recorded two other names; doladzi , which appears to be a proper, opaque name and gulnegwa or 'large acorns', 79 the name given by Mooney to Q. nigra . However, Q. rubra does have the largest acorns of the oaks common to the Southern Appalac hian Mountains, so this name would seem most appropriate when applied to Q. rubra . Olbrechts found Q. rubra to be a component in several formulas for a wide range of conditions. It was one of the plants used for painful urination or eisti andik appetite gets spoiled'). It was part of the wound healing formula for such conditions as adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by wood'). The roots were used with others for dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine') and it was a component of the formula used when someone had diarrhea due to atawini ei ('the forest dwellers'). Olbrechts also said it was one of four differ ent types of red oak, the barks of which were boiled down and placed while still hot against an aching tooth. However, the only other species of oak that he identified for this purpose was Q. velutina . It was part of a formula with Castanea dentata for 'when they dream of all sorts of things' (see above), but the other trees whose barks were used fo r this condition are not evident form his notes. The other woody species that he ident ifies for this condition, a species of Ilex, Clethra acuminata , and a species of Cornus , are all shrubs and will be dealt with in a later chapter. tsugwal\u00e2ga tsegwa - 'big leaves' - Magnolia fraseri Walter - umbrella tree The large leaves, up to a half a meter long, indicate the source for this Cherokee name. Mooney also mistakenly identified tsugwal\u00e2ga tsegwa as Chionanthus viriginicus L., but his description of the seed heads as being red, shaped like ears of corn, and containing round, red berries indicates that this is a species of Magnolia . He also said 80 that the leaves were 15 inches long, about twice the length of those of Chionanthus . A sketch of the outline of the leaf in a la ter work (Ms. 1894) is clearly that of M. fraseri . Medicinally, Olbrechts found it to be used for toothaches, the bark either steeped and the infusion held in the mouth or chewed and held against the tooth, or as a remedy for painful urination when combined with Quercus velutina . Banks found that a tea of the bark of tsugwal\u00e2ga tsegwa was sniffed up the nose for sinus problems, but he identified the botanical species as Magnolia macrophylla Michaux (1953: 51). This is most likely a misidentification, as M. macrophylla has not been recorded in the mountains of North Carolina and both are commonly referred to as umbrella tree (Radford et al. 1968: 474). tsuhy\u00fbnsti (t) - 'bitter (wood)' - Magnolia acuminata L. - cucumber tree Olbrechts recorded M. acuminata as tsuy\u00f6sti ('they are bitter'), which appears to be a version of tsuhy\u00fbnsti , which Mooney recorded on one of his later trips to the Cherokee reservation (Ms. 1894). It was used in the formula for uyalotisga ('if there is swelling'), with Castanea pumila for dunitsal\u00f6i ('when they have blisters'), as part of the formula for eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss). Alone it was chewed or steeped into a tea and kept in contact with a sore tooth. B anks (1953: 51) found that the leaves were combined with those of Ostrya virginiana (Miller) K. Koch and made into a decoction for a toothache. The bark tea was also used to re lieve cramps in infants, ease belching and stomach aches, and was part of a formula for bloody flux. 81 tsuk\u00e2nan - ash - Fraxinus americana L. Tsuk\u00e2nan appears to be an opaque, proper name for the ash tree; however, Olbrechts noted that the name was shared wi th the wooden mortar in which corn was pounded. This was originally made of ash, but at the time of his research it was made of oak. Olbrechts recorded that tsuk\u00e2nan was used medicinally in formulas for the urinary tract condition known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss) and for gig\u00f6 analdziskwsk\u00f6i ('when they spit blood'). It was also used for a form of dal\u00e2ni , but Olbrechts gave no further information on how it was used or wi th what it might be combined. Witthoft found that the bark of F. americana was used as a treatment for diabetes (n.d.: 147-148). The bark must be harvested from the east si de of the tree near ground level and large quantities of the tea, prepared one time in a la rge batch, are drunk at night over a four- day interval whenever the patient wakes up. This is a rare remedy for diabetes, a disease which Witthoft claims was ram pant among the Cherokee when he was there in the 1940s. ts\u00fbnwagi gigage adsil\u00fb sk - 'maple with red flowers' - Acer ru brum L. - red maple Mooney did not provide a gloss for ts\u00fbnwagi gigage adsil\u00fb sk and Olbrechts glossed it as 'plant red flowers', but ts\u00fbnwagi does not gloss as 'plant'. But both King (1975) and Alexander (1971) included a Cherokee word for maple in their dictionaries, tsuwaki and tlvwagi respecitively, and it was obvious from these that ts\u00fbnwagi is the generic term for 'maple'. Other variations in spelling included tsuwagi (Olbrechts) and kl\u00fbhwag (Mooney, Ms. 1894). 82 Olbrechts found A. rubrum was with Diospyros virginiana for the type of cancer known as adayeski ('eating itself') and for with Quercus velutina , it was used for wounds caused by arrows, bullets, axe cuts, etc. No directions for preparation or application were provided for the latter. Banks found that a decoction of the bark of A. rubrum was used for dysentery, hives, and combined with Quercus alba , Q. nigra (but see guln\u00e9gwa above), and Castanea dentata for menstrual irregularities. T he steam from the boiled bark was allowed to enter the eyes to help with b lindness (1953: 81-81). In his recounting of the plants observed by the early 19th century missionaries working with the Cherokee, Witthoft also reported that A. rubrum was used for eye problems. The notes of Mrs. Anna Gambold, the wife of Moravian minist er John Gambold, contained the following use for A. rubrum , \"The inner bark boiled to a syrup, made into pills, and these dissolved in water, is used in case of sore eyes; the eyes washed therewith.\" ts\u00fbnwagi unega adsil\u00fb sk - 'maple with white flowers' - Acer saccharum Marshall - sugar maple While the flowers are described as being more greenish-yellow than white (Radford et al. 1968: 688), they are obviously lighter in color than the red maple and would help give the tree a whitish appearance wh ile in bloom. No medicinal applications were recorded for A saccharum , but it the sap was processed into a sweetening agent. It has been speculated that the precontact Cher okee used Gleditsia triacanthos as their primary sweetener, but that they later lear ned to process maple sap from the Iroquois (Goodwin 1977: 59). 83 tsuny\u00fbst - 'bitter' - Cercis canadensis L. - redbud Mooney did not clarify whether the name tsuny\u00fbst was synonymous for both Cercis canadensis and Magnolia acuminata , but the similar spelling and gloss for the Cherokee name suggests that it may have been so. Banks (1953: 70) referred to C. canadensis as kwaniyust\u00ed ('little peach'), but this is an obvious misidentification on his part. This also raises doubt on his reference to its use as a remedy for whooping cough (see kwaniyust\u00ed above). No other medicinal applications were attributed to C. canadensis , but Witthoft (1947) did write that the Cherokee children were fond of snacking on the flowers. tsusk - 'heads' - Quercus stellata Wang. ( Q. obtusifolia ) The name stems from a plural form of usk or 'head', but Mooney gave no explanation for the name. Olbrechts recorded its use in formulas for the ('dal\u00e2ni squatting down'), a form of biliousness or gastric distress with gripping pains (see dal\u00e2ni in the appendix). tsusk\u00fbtal\u00e1lti - 'striped shins' - L. - silverbell Mooney claimed the name stemm ed from the plural form of uskutag ('shin'), which is tsuskutag . It is in reference to the stripped appearance of the trunk of the tree. The only medicinal application came from Ol brechts, who found that it was used with other unidentified materials for backaches. 84 tsutan\u00fb or tsutkn - ironwood - Carpinus caroliniana Walter Mooney did not elaborate on the two names he recorded for C. caroliniana , but the variations are consistent with other renditions of the middle and upper dialects of Cherokee that he recorded for other species. Tsutan\u00fb appears to be an opaque, proper name for ironwood. Mooney found it was us ed with other barks and plant parts for cancer and old sores (see k\u00fbnst\u00fbts above). Olbrechts recorded two uses for C. caroliniana in The Swimmer Manuscript , as part of the for un\u00f6di tsandik u\u00e7a ('they urinate all a type of dal\u00e2ni (1932: 265), but he also found other uses that were not published. It was part of the formula for the conditions unawasti egwa ('big chill') and unakewag\u00f6i ('if they lost their as well as being used alone for toothaches. ud\u00e2ln serviceberry species as Amelanchier canadensis (L.) Medicus, but that species is not found in the mountains of western North Carolina. Ud\u00e2ln appears to be an opaque, proper name for serviceberry. Olbrechts recorded several medicinal uses for A. arborea , but only its application in a formula for a severe form of diarrhea was published (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 283). The unpublished uses included its presence in formulas for three conditions of the urinary tract; a type of painful urination (no gloss), and backache. Witthoft 85 reported that the berries are a relished wi ld food, typically eaten raw when found name \u00fbnag\u00e9 ('black') is also used for several herbaceous species, usually due to the overall appearance or to the attri butes of one specific plant part, but Mooney did not clarify which aspect of A. fraseri the Cherokee considered to embody blackness. However, he did say that the Cherokee recognized a male and a female form of \u00fbnag\u00e9, recognized by the male having alternate branches and the female having opposite branches. The genus Abies , like all members of the family Pinaceae, is monoecious, each individual having both male and female flowers. However, the older common names for A. fraseri and Picea rubens 1968: 38,40), respectively, and it may be that the association recorded by Mooney is based on a folk model of male and female kinds in nature. This association has been observed in both the mountain and Cherokee folk classification systems (Cozzo 2003) and this appears to be another example of this. Olbrechts identified \u00fbnag\u00e9 as P. rubens , further supporting the likelihood of this association. The two species, remnants from a time when the region was much cool er, are found growing together at the highest altitudes in the Blue Ridge Mountains and are the dominant species at those altitudes, which is commonly known as the Spruce-Fir forest. This would suggest a special relationship between the two that would not be obvious in a more diverse forest and 86 may explain the Cherokee perception that they are male and female types of the same tree. No medicinal uses were reported for either tree. un\u00edkw - black gum - Nyssa sylvatica Marsh. ( N. multiflora ) Un\u00edkw appears an opaque, proper name for N. sylvatica . It appears several times in The Swimmer Manuscript , as an alternative to Oxydendron arboreum for dal\u00e2ni dikstoti ('to make patient vomit bile') (1932: 218), and the formula for severe or chr onic diarrhea (1932: 283). This last condition was not included Olbrechts' notes on ethnomedical conditions, so I will include the formula from The Swimmer Manuscript in this section. A decoction was made from the roots, harve sted from the east side of the tree, , , along with runners from the east sides of the vines Vitis aestivalis and Ampelopsis cordata , was boiled down for four consecutive times before it is administered to the patient. Chicken and fish were avoided during the treatment (1932: 283). The presence of Ampelopsis cordata in this formula is probably a misidentification, as it is a Piedmont species that has only been located in Madison County in t he mountains of North Carolina. Olbrechts also cited other uses for N. sylvatica in his notes. It was one of the barks used for wounds or when one was shot, such as in the condition adayunitil\u00f6 (pierced by wood'). Un\u00edkw was combined with other unidentified plants for gonorrhea and toothaches as well as being part of a cancer formula for adayeski ('eating itself'). 87 Banks found N. sylvatica was still in use at the time of his research in 1952. A tea of the bark was used to stop excessive mens trual bleeding. The roots were made into a tea to aid the delivery of birthing women and an \"ooze\", or thick decoction, was made from the roots for eye problems. The \"ooze\" was wrapped in a cloth and allowed to drip into the afflicted eyes. Also, a decoction of the a tea for \"bad disease\", a condition whose primary symptom was a severe fever (Banks 1953: 90-91). Witthoft (n.d.: 134) found N. sylvatica was used as an ingredient for venereal disease, but only named Liquidambar styraciflua as one of the ingredients. There were at least ten other unidentified tree barks used in the formula. He also said a cold infusion was used as a burn remedy, again attributing to its reputation as a wound healer. He also found that a depression was carved into a sound length of black gum, about 15 inches across and three feet tall, and this was used as the pounding block for the corn mortar. The toughness of the cro ss-grained wood and its resistance to decay made it an ideal choice (n.d.: 133). The Cherokee also used hollow sections of the trunks of large specimens of N. sylvatica for \"bee gums\" (n.d.: 134). As this name suggests, the practice of using hollow black gum logs by beekeepers was common where the trees reached a usable size (Wigginton 1972: 37). \u00faniskw\u00fbt\u00fb - flava Mooney said stems from or 'they have a head', but this Witthoft (n.d.: 137) claims this was a pr oper name for the yellow buckeye and doubts 88 this etymology for the name. However, the seeds can be described as head-like and there may be little cause to doubt Mooney's assertion. Olbrechts recorded some uses for buckeye, but he claimed that the Cherokee used the red buckeye, Aesculus pavia L., for medicinal purposes. This is highly unlikely as A. pavia is limited to the coastal plain of North Carolina and not found in the mountains. The only species common to the mountains is A. octandra (Radford et al. 1968: 690) and I will assume that it is the s pecies that Olbrechts found in his research. Olbrechts identified \u00faniskw\u00fbt\u00fb as part of the formula for unitseno iseoi ('when a person has stomach trouble') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 239). In his notes he recorded it used for a variety of problems a ssociated with the urinary tract. He noted it as a remedy for painful urination, whic h may possibly have been the condition known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i. It was a part of the formulas for tw o conditions that were typified by a whitish discharge in the urine, uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white') and uneg\u00f6 unanugots e\u00e7a ('it is coming out white'). Buckeye was also a component in a complex formula for dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine'). Witthoft (n.d.: 139) found that the bar k was steeped and used in small quantities by midwives to aid with postpartum cramping, but it was considered a dangerous remedy. In his rewrite of the notes of a Moravian missionary, Witthoft (1947) also found the pounded nuts were used as a poultice and the bark as a fish poison. Banks also recorded several uses for \u00faniskw\u00fbt\u00fb , which he also mistakenly identified as A. pavia , possibly due to the initial identif ication by Olbrechts (1953: 82-83). The nuts appeared to be the most medicinal por tion of the buckeye. The meat of the nuts was used as a salve to heal sores (much like the poultice activity above) and 89 simply carrying a nut on one's person will help cu re piles. Small pieces of the nut were chewed and the juice was swallowed for colic. When a person was feeling \"queer\", like they were going to feint or have a seizure, the nuts were ground and steeped in warm water. This infusion was drunk by the affl icted. Banks also elaborated on the use of \u00faniskw\u00fbt\u00fb as a birthing plant. The bark was made into a tea to aid in delivery and, like Witthoft, he found that a tea of buckeye and Castanea dentata in small portions would ease postpartum cramping and bleeding. Again, there was a warning against using too much, \"or it will stop everything.\" \u00fastst stems from d\u00edstst ('spinning wheel'), but Witthoft found that spinning wheels were made of tulip poplar in the Cherokee region of the mountains and this was probably not due to the use of the wood of holly. He said the name refers to the act of twisti ng cord or thread, whether on the thigh or on a wheel, but that the name could also stem from the whorled (or spinning) appearance of the leaves (n.d.: 146). Neither is a sati sfactory explanation for the etymology of \u00fastst. Olbrechts found a variation on the name, calling it tsustasti ('she will spin') but he provided no explanation for the source of the name. The only medicinal application came from Banks (1953: 80) who found that the leaves used to scratch muscles that were sore with cramps. He did not indi cate if any medicines were applied after scratching. Other species of Ilex that were used for a variety of medicinal applications are shrubby species and will be described in another chapter. 90 wan\u00e9 - hickory - Carya spp. Wan\u00e9 is handled as the folk generic for the hickories by Witthoft (n.d.: 52), Perry (1974: 40), and Banks (1953: 24), and appears to be an opaque, proper name. Determining the botanical species that constitutes wan\u00e9 is quite confusing, especially in light of the large number of botanical synony ms for each of the hickories (Britton and (Carya ovalis f.) Loudon) wan\u00e9 tsutisti (no gloss for tsutisti ). He also identified them by the common names shagbark and shellbark hickory, neither of which matches the botanical species he named. Two species carry the specific epithet alba, yet the generic epithet is different, indicating two distinct species. Witthoft (n .d.: 52) stated that the two edible species favored by the Cherokee were the variety with large nuts, or C. ovata , and the small fruited variety, C. ovalis . Distribution maps or descriptions of distributions indicate the occurrence of C. ovata as very limited in the mountai ns of North Carolina and that C. laciniosa is rare in the whole state of North Carolina (Radford et al. 364 and 365), further complicating any chance of identifyi ng the species under consideration here. For the purposes of ethnobotanical classificati on it is sufficient to state that wan\u00e9 is the folk generic for the hickories and that at least two folk species were recognized, wan\u00e9 sh 91 is probably a third folk species, but without a gloss for tsutisti this would be difficult to establish. Olbrechts identifies two conditions treated with the inner bark of the hickory in The Swimmer Manuscript , dualagosa ('inflammation of the palate') was treated by the medicine man chewing the bark and blowing t he juice into the mouth of the patient (1932: 260). Yigetsiyol\u00f6 ('if they have been shot (by a bullet or arrow)') was treated in a similar way, the chewed bark blown through a bu zzard quill or the hollow stalk of a plant that Olbrechts identified as Gerardia pedicularia , which was later changed to Aureolaria pedicularia (L.) Raf. (1932: 273). Olbrechts included several more uses for hickory bark in his notes. He wrote that the Cherokee considered it a \"universal panac ea for all wounds\" and in this capacity it was used in a formula for adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by wood'), for accidents with axes known as undaluy\u00f6\u00e7i ('chopped' or 'if they have chopped it'), for tsidunitstaldia ('if they have scars'), and by itself for the type of cancer known as adayeski ('eating itself'). It appeared in a formul a to treat the urinary tract condition known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no gloss) for un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc e\u00e7a ('when their appetite gets spoiled'). He also wrote that it was part of a formula to make somewhat forget, but he did not elaborate on the condi tion or the formula. This is probably a formula for painful remembrances of a recently departed loved one. Thoughts and dreams of the deceased were thought to be signs of a departed spirit calling their loved one to join them in the afterlife (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 26). 92 Banks also recorded several uses for wan\u00e9 (1953: 25). Ball players drank an infusion of the bark to keep their limbs suppl e. An infusion of a type of tuberculosis caused by conjurers. The bark of a species only identified as black hickory was steeped in cold water and the infusion was blown over patients to alleviate the pain of poliomyelitis ; however, it did not prevent the crippling effects of the disease. The nuts of hickory were an important food item for the Cherokee. The whole nuts were crushed with a wooden mortar until the shells and nutmeats were pulverized, then rolled into balls for immediate use or storage. These balls would then be boiled in water, the shells sifted out, and the resulting nut milk used as a base for soup or drunk as a beverage (Witthoft n.d.: 52). Earlier acc ounts state that the oil from the nuts was extracted and used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The nuts were pounded in the manner described above and boiled until the oil floated to the surface. The oil was then skimmed off the surface of the water and placed in a vessel. This was heated until all residual water had evaporated and then stored in a container for future use. The finished product, \"resembled bear's oil in both consistency and appearance and answered all the purposes of that oil (Payne n.d.: 157).\" watsiy or wag - Spanish oak, Southern red oak - Quercus falcata Michx. Watsiy and wag appear to be proper, opaque names as Mooney provided no gloss for either. Olbrechts found Q. falcata to be a component in the formulas for 93 unakewag\u00f6i ('if they lost their voice') for uneg\u00f6 they water out white'). 94 Chapter 4 Uw\u00e1wat\u00e9na - Shrub Ud\u00fbns\u00edn - Vine Mooney mentioned the life form \"shrub\" in the myth concerning the origin of medicine (1900: 252), but he did not provide the exact Cherokee word that could be glossed as 'shrub'. The botanical usage of the term \"shrub\" usually encompasses perennial woody plants with relatively low stature (when compared to trees) and multiple stems. Mooney did collect terms that appr oach this meaning. For instance, in his description of the Cherokee name for Desmodium nudiflorum , he glossed Plants, Part 3). In 1885, bef ore he visited the reservation, Mooney interviewed then Cherokee chief Nimrod J. Smith and recorded a glossary of Cherokee terms (Mooney n. d. g). He recorded the word for \"brush\" as tsuy\u00e2nu and \"thicket\" or \"bushes\", as s\u00fbl\u00fay. The latter may have been restricted to low, wet ground, but other contextual usage of s\u00fbl\u00fay places this in question (see below). As uw\u00e1wat\u00e9na appears to most closely approach the botanical definit ion of a shrub, I have headed this section by that name. Mooney did not specify what constitut ed the Cherokee concept of 'shrub' and the variability inherent in the botanical life form known as shrubs makes it difficult to establish which plants should be included in this category. For instance, Xanthorhiza 95 simplicissima is known as a colonial shrub (Radf ord et al. 1968: 453), but the plants are usually only 1 foot tall and rarely surpass a height of 2 feet. The members of the genus Rubus are considered shrubs, but the canes of the bramble fruits are often referred to as vines. The smaller members of the genus Acer are considered predominantly shrubby, but some individuals reach the proportion and habit of small trees. As the Cherokee perception of the inclusiveness of the category \"shrub\" was not recorded, those plants that fit the botanical definit ion will be included in this chapter. Mooney recorded the word for 'vine' as ud\u00fbns\u00edn, but did not discuss its place in the ethnobotanical classification system. There are several morphological similarities between shrubs and vines (woody stems, diffu se branching patterns, etc.), but also considerable differences (vines have flexible stems, the two often occupy different ecological niches, etc.). As several of the species of vines used by the Cherokee were used in conjunction with or in place of certai n shrubby species, they are included in this chapter solely at the discretion of the author. The various researchers collected t he names of 38 folk genera of shrubs and vines representing 57 botanical species. The relationship between the folk genera and botanical species is as complex as that in the tree life form (see Table 4.1) and comparisons between the shrubs and trees are necessary due to botanical inclusiveness that crosses life forms. For instance, the shrubby members of the genus Cornus are known as kinds of walh\u00fbnega, but Cornus florida , a small tree, was called kn\u00fbst, a name indicating no clear relationship. Wh ile the leaves are quite similar, the obvious difference in flower morphology may have contributed to the Cherokee differentiation at the generic level. The shrubby member of the genus Acer, discussed in 96 the previous chapter, was classified in a different folk genus from the larger tree species, even though the leaves and fruit are morphically similar. Castanea pumila , the shrubby member of the udes the American chestnut, was called unig\u00edna , a label with no obvious relationship to its larger cousin, til'. Yet Leucothoe axillaris was labeled as n\u00fbd\u00e2gweja-iyu st ('like of its resemblance to Oxydendron arboreum (n\u00fbd\u00e2gweja ). However, there is no apparent linguistic relationship to its sister botanical species, L. recurva , labeled with the opaque name euis\u00fah. There also appears to be no general pattern among the vines. The members of the botanical genus Smilax were generally known as kinds of galiw\u00e2d, while the various species of Vitis were labeled with distinct, opaque names. The viney members of the genus Rubus were labeled as utl\u00e1sin\u00fbta ('it has crept'), while the erect, bushy members were called kinds of s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l ('bowl'). The perceptual similarity between Passiflora incarnata , labeled as uwl, and P. lutea was recognized by labeling the latter as uwliy\u00fast. Certain polytypic folk genera of shrubs demonstrated apparent linguistic relationships.The functional relationship between the laurels ( Kalmia latifolia , Rhododendron maximum , R. catawbiense ) is evident by their inclusion in the folk genus dus\u00faa, a reference to their use in the scratch ing ritual. Perceptual similarities are evident in the labeling of Viburnum acerifolium as k\u00fbnig\u00fbiy\u00fast , an acknowledgement of its V. prunifolium (k\u00fbnig\u00fb), and Lyonia ligustrina as kuw\u00e1ya-iyu st in recognition of its resemblance to the blueberries and huckleberries ( kuw\u00e1ya ). 97 For all the variety that appears in the relationship between the Cherokee shrub and vine category and the botanical classificati on system, there is one consistency that is notable. Rarely are unrelated botanica l genera included in the same folk genera and those that are, such as Kalmia latifolia in the genus dus\u00faa or Lyonia ligustrina as resembling kuw\u00e1ya , they are in the same botanical fa mily as the other members of the folk genus. So, why botanical relationships are not always apparent from the Cherokee labels, there are also no apparent anomalie s when comparing the Cherokee system to the botanical system. Table 4.1. Shrub and Vine Index: Botanical Species and Folk Genera Botanical Species Folk Genus Botanical Species Folk at\u00e1yakalsk - 'it chokes one' - Rosa carolina L. - wild rose The name at\u00e1yakalsk stems from \u00e1giyg\u00fblih\u00fb ('I am choking') and was attributed to the fact that the \"berries (hips) are dry and powdery when bitten.\" Or, as another informant noted, the berries were, \"furry Mooney form of ag\u00edst ('food'). This was because rabbits were perceived to be fond of the berries. Olbrechts recorded several synonyms for R. carolina based on the recognition of it as the 'small' kind, as well as at\u00e1yakalsk ig\u00e2tenh or ts\u00edst- un\u00edgist ig\u00e2tenh, signifying that it was known as the 'swamp-growing' kind. The designation as the 'swamp-growing' kind suggests that these species names may have also been used for Rosa palustris Marshall, the swamp rose, which is morphologically very similar to R. carolina and inhabits the same distribution range (Radford et al. 1968: 551). According to Olbrechts, R. carolina was used in combination with R. eglanteria , Euonymus americanus , and Phlox stolonifera for diarrhea with a slimy discharge. He also recorded that R. palustris was used for two conditions involving the loss of blood, gig\u00f6 dig\u00f6guski ('when they discharge \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood'). He did not indicate whic h parts of the plants were used or how they were prepared. 99 at\u00e1yakalsk gatush - 'it chokes one, mountain dwelling' - Rosa eglanteria L. - sweet briar rose qualifier gatush ('mountain dwelling') stems from large'). It was used with or in place of R. carolina for slimy diarrhea and gig\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood') and in combination with two species of Ilex for groin pain caused by a ghost. The roots were used as an emetic when prepared in Hydrangea arborescens from ta ('wood') and tssiw ('empty or hollow') and was due to the stem having pith instead of a solid core. Mooney also recorded the synonyms ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk ta-tssiw ('it peels them off, hollow wood'), which was due to the exfoliating bark, and ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk usts\u00e1h ('it peels them off, topknot'), referring to the appearance of the infloresc ence. Olbrechts recorded it simply as ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk , suggesting that his informants found the exfoliating bark a more diagnostic feature than the pithy core. But Mooney found that the folk generic ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk was a reference to Clethra acuminata (see below) which also has exfoliating bark. Mooney found that a cold infusion of eit her the roots or the bark was drunk to stop vomiting. Olbrechts found that it was combined with Lindera benzoin for the same 100 purpose and used by women for andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'). An infusion of the bark was also used as an emetic for the biliary condition known as dal\u00e2ni ('yellow') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 192). A cold in fusion of the green bark was given to infants and children to alleviate vomiting, while the freshly scraped bark was used on burns and swellings or made into a poultice and used on sore muscles (Banks 1953: 57). ta-tssiw ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk - 'hollow wood, it peels them off' - Acer pensylvanicum L. - striped maple Mooney did not explain the gloss for this name (Ms. 1894), and it is not clear why this would be known as 'hollow wood' or why it is described as having bark that peels off. He also recorded the synonym ta-tssiw ditawisgage , but provided no gloss for the specific qualifier. However, Olbrechts also recorded it as ta-tssiw without a modifier, so the perception of hollowne ss or pithy wood appears to be consistent. Acer pensylvanicum is a northern species that grows as a shrub or small tree and reaches its southern terminus in the Southern A ppalachian Mountains (Preston 1989: 311). Olbrechts found that it was used in a form ula with 18 other plants for when a person \"feels queer\", a condition caused by the intervention of a witch. aylat\u00edsk - 'its abdomen is swollen' - Vaccinium stamineum L. - wild gooseberry, deerberry The folk generic aylat\u00edsk stems from ayl\u00e2tistih\u00fb ('it is causing the abdomen to swell'), which is a composite of skwal\u00edy ('abdomen') and gat\u00edsk\u00fb ('it is swelling'). 101 Mooney speculated that this was due to the swollen appearance of the berry. A decoction of all parts of the plant was drunk at night and the following morning before meals for colic with associated cramps . A decoction of the roots prepared in combination with of Gaylussacia baccata , Amelanchier arborea , and Ilex montana for excess menstrual discharge with a pale co lor. Mooney said the berries were always eaten raw, never dried for future use. Wittho ft also said they were eaten from the bush when very ripe, but not normally gathered for use during meals (n.d.: 45). He found that they were sometimes stewed, but not preserved for future use. dal\u00e2ni - 'yellow' - Rhus copallina L. - winged sumac Mooney did not explain why R. copallina was referred to as 'yellow', but both he and Olbrechts recorded dal\u00e2ni as the folk generic. From my observations of the plant I would suggest that it might have been due to the inflorescence, which has a yellowish color. Mooney also recorded it as dal\u00e2ni k\u00fbl\u00e1gw -iy\u00fast ('yellow, like sumac'), , tsun\u00e2gsti ('yellow foods'), the edibility of the sour berries. Mooney did not provide a gloss for tsun\u00e2gsti (Ms. 1894), but it appears to be a plural form of ag\u00edst ('food'). Olbrechts recorded the name for R. copallina as dal\u00e2ni goksti ('yellow, to smoke'), due to the prevalent use of the leaves in smoking mixtures. An early 19 th century account from the Payne/Butrick papers referred to it as \"the common talony used for smoking\" to distinguish it from Xanthorhiza simplicissima , which was also recorded as talony (Payne n.d.b: 279). In fact, Mooney said that the leaves were once used in place of tobacco (Ms. 1894). 102 Olbrechts found that R. copallina was used in a formula for blisters caused by the sun, known as unawat\u00f6\u00f6ski ('blisters'). dal\u00e2ni Marshall - yellow-root The name dal\u00e2ni was in reference to the intensely yellow color that was apparent when the bark is removed from t he roots. The specific qualifier amayutehi ('water edge growing') refers to the preferred habitat of X. simplicissima , which is commonly found growing near mountain streams. echts also recorded the synonyms dal\u00e2nige unastetsi ('yellow root') due to the yellow color that permeates the roots and g\u00edgag\u00e9 atataski ('bloody juice comes out of it'), but he did not explain the gloss and during my interactions with this plant I have not obser ved red juice coming from any of its parts. The broad range of seemingly unrelated uses for X. simplicissima suggests that this was an important medicinal in t he Cherokee pharmacopoeia. Mooney recorded a single use (1891: 364), as a decoction that was blown on the head, breast, and palm of each hand of a birthing mother. This was re iterated as the single published account of for this plant's use by Olbrechts (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 274), but he recorded a number of uses in his notes. The yellow root s were indicative of its efficacy for the condition dal\u00e2ni tsan\u00f6tiy\u00f6skili\u00e7a ('when they have yellow slime coming out of their nostrils'). It was used alone or in combination with other plants for danakewsk\u00f6i ('when they have diarrhea'). The roots were also steeped and the infusion held in the mouth to cure thrush. 103 Banks (1953: 47-48) added the scraped bark was used as a poultice to relieve sore eyes, the root was added to mutton tallow and used as a salve for sores, and the chewed root or an infusion of the root was us ed for a sore mouth. A tea of the roots was drunk to alleviate cramps and to calm nerves. A decoction of X. used as a blood tonic and to increase the appetite. Yellowroot was also the primary source of yellow dye used to color white oak baskets as well as masks, bows, and other objects. In the early part of the 19 th century, this dye, with the addition of black oak bark, was also used to color ceremonial feathers, turning them \"a most brilliant yellow\" (Payne - poison sumac According to Mooney, did\u00e1ley\u00fbsk was the plural form of ad\u00e1ey\u00fbsk ('it burns them'), which stemmed from tsiltisk\u00fb ('I am burning it habitually'). This was due to the severe dermatological irritation caused by contact with R. vernix . While not common in the southern Appalachians, it is found in t he southwestern portion of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 677) and its reputati on would have guaranteed its persistence in Cherokee folklore, much as the fear of \"poison sumac\" does in the Euro-American tradition. Witthoft referred to it as \"one of the most dreaded of local plants\" and was told of one fatality due to contact with this plant (n.d.: 60). 104 din\u00fbsk or didan\u00fbsk - 'breeder' stem from an\u00fbsk\u00fb ('it is bringing forth'), a term used for birthing animals and birds laying eggs, but not for women. It was called 'breeder' because it was thought that a thorn from din\u00fbsk, if left in the flesh, will breed other thorns in the same spot. Mooney only identif ied this to the genus level, but he described it as having, \"slender stalks, smaller thorns\", which fits the description for S. tamnoides . This may also have been the species used for scratching ceremonies (see galiw\u00e2d below). However, Witthoft claimed Mooney was mistaken and din\u00fbsk was not a species of Smilax , but a species of Rubus with \"innumerable tiny prickles\" on the creeping vine that were impossible to completely remove if a bare leg caught the runner. A voucher specimen would be necessary to settle the discrepancy. ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk - 'it peels them off' - Clethra acuminata Michaux sweet pepperbush The name the exfoliating bark of acuminata . Olbrechts also recorded the synonym saluyitsuga ('the tree growing among the laurels') due to its habitat preference, but he placed the name ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk next to it in parentheses. However, he did not specify if it was a folk species of ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk or if this was an alternative name. Clethra acuminata was included in two formulas from The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 192 and 218), both referring to its use as an emetic to dislodge stagnant bile in cases of dal\u00e2ni . In the first reference, he stated that specimens of both C. acuminata and Hydrangea arborescens were collected by his informants as samples of saluyitsuga . The two may have been used interchangeably, especially for biliary disease, but this is not clear from either his or Mooney's notes (see 105 ta-tssiw above). Olbrechts also recorded that C. acuminata was combined with Dirca palustris for another biliary condition known as dal\u00e2ni unitel\u00f6ska ('shaking dal\u00e2ni '), as well as for strange dreams asso ciated with a woman's menstrual cycle. Banks added that an infusion of the bark was used for bowel complaints and a decoction of the bark, in combination with Prunus serotina , was drunk to break a high fever (1953: 97). dus\u00faa gatush - 'laurel, mountain dwelling' mountain rosebay, purple laurel Mooney and Witthoft both indicated that dus\u00faa was an opaque, proper name for the laurels. But Olbrechts glossed it as 'they are claws'; possibly referring to their topical application in rituals that involved scratching (see askwaneta in Herbaceous Plants, Part 3). The word dus\u00faa may also be closely related to dan\u00faga ('scratcher'), a term that applied to the scratching devices used by t he medicine men, and also to the leg of a grasshopper (see dan\u00faga in Herbaceous Plants, Part 3). The specific qualifier gatush was a combination of gat\u00fas ('mountain') and eh ('dwelling' or 'growing'), because of the tendency for R. catawbiense to grow high in the mountains. No applications were attributed to R. catawbiense and it is not clear from the notes if it was an acceptable alternative to R. maximum (see below). dus\u00faa tsund\u00ed-ga - 'small laurel' - Kalmia latifolia L. - mountain laurel The specific qualifier tsund\u00ed-ga is the plural from of usd\u00edga ('small'). According to Mooney, a decoction Rhododendron maximum , and Leucothoe axillaris 106 was applied to a scratched area for the relief of involuntary muscular twitching and rheumatism of the knee. The Cherokee woul d not burn any part of these plants, not even the leaves swept off of the floor, bec ause burning would destroy their medicinal qualities of the whole species and cause t he onset of cold weather (Mooney 1900: 422). Olbrechts was more general about its use and recorded that K. latifolia was combined with R. maximum trifoliatus , and Veratrum viride as rule, used for all conditions that requir ed pretreatment by scratching (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 203-204). with Cassia marilandica substituted for P. trifoliatus , was used for heart attacks, know to the Cherokee as usonuli unt ane\u00f6 ('sudden attack'). Dus\u00faa tsund\u00ed-ga was made into a warm infusion with R. maximum and V. viride , and rubbed on an area scratched with the serrated edges of the leaves of L. axillaris for the condition unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i ('when they have pains all over their body'). The medicine man follows the pain to different areas, treating each spot each spot until there is no new pain (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 220-221). Banks similarly found that the laurels were used to treat r heumatism, as well as for preventing cramps in ball players (1953: 99). dus\u00faa ts\u00fantana - 'large laurel' - Rhododendron maximum L. - great laurel The specific qualifier ts\u00fantana is the plural form of \u00fatana ('large'). As the Cherokee and common names suggest, this shrub can get quite large and will sometimes reach the proportion of a sm all tree (Radford et al. 1968: 798). The medicinal uses have been discussed in the previous entry; however, the wood was also favored by woodworkers for making combs and spoons. Well-seasoned rhododendron 107 wood was used to make, \"the finest cooking spoons made anywhere\" (Witthoft n.d.: 139). elskal - New Jersey tea or redroot - Ceanothus americanus L. Elskal appears to be an opaque, proper name for C. americanus . Mooney found that a warm decoction of remedy for fevers. Olbrechts noted that the steeped root was dr unk for dysentery and that the plant was used in ceremonies to separate two lovers . Banks found that large quantities of warm elskal tea were drunk as an emetic for when one was \"tired in the chest\", and a tea of the roots was drunk before bedtime for bowel complaints (1953:84). euis\u00fah - Ahles appears to be an opaque, proper name for dog-hobble. Most of the uses for L. axillaris were recorded above (see dus\u00faa tsund\u00ed-ga ). In addition to these, Mooney found that a cold infusion of the beat en leaves was applied after scratching for rheumatism, hurts, and stings. Olbrechts called euis\u00fah, \"one of the most important agents in the Cherokee materia medica \". Besides its use in conditions that required scratching, it was used with the three varieties of dus\u00faa for dinileni dunt askiye\u00f6i ('their ears burst'). Banks (1953:100) found that an \" ooze\" of the roots was applied to a dog's skin to cure mange and that people would bathe in a decoction of the leaves and stems to cure a related condition; the \"itch\" or sc abies. It is extremely toxic and, according to 108 Witthoft, it was \"used only in medicine, and externally at that, and is noted mostly to prevent stock and children from chewing on it (n.d.: 60).\" (spelled with a \"g\" or a \"k\") appears to be an opaque, proper name for the elderberries. The specific qualifier usd\u00edga indicates that there were at least two folk species, but the vague botanical identific ation for the small variety and no outside references to \"mountain elderberry\" makes it di fficult to clarify this point. Witthoft (n.d.: 40) also mentions that the Cherokee dist inguished between a large and small variety of gaks\u00fbka , but he decided that they were ecological variations of the same species. The red elderberry, Sambucus racemosa L. var. racemosa Michaux, grows at the higher elevations and apart from the red fruit and panicula te inflorescence, is very similar to the elderberry, Sambucus canadensis (see below), so there is a good chance that Mooney misidentified it as a Viburnum . No medicinal uses were attributed to gaks\u00fbka usd\u00edga and, if it was S. racemosa , the fruits are considered to be toxic and are usually avoided (Muenscher 1975: 221). gaks\u00fbka \u00fatana species of gaks\u00fbka , but Witthoft, Banks, and Olbrechts simply referred to it by the folk generic. Mooney found that the bark, scraped from the stems of S. canadensis , was combined with Xanthorhiza simplicissima and made into a tea and considered a good remedy for the small white worms that were common in children. Olbr echts recorded that a young root growing 109 from a new sprout of an old root of Sambucus canadensis was made into a hot infusion and drunk for the kidney condition dunats\u00f6wal\u00f6 ne \u00f6i ('swellings on both sides'). He also found it used for heartburn and the biliary condition dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). Banks (1953: 121) added that elderberry tea was a remedy for rheumatism and that a decoction of the bark was used for diarrhea (\"summer complaint\"). Several sources suggest that the berries were used in jelly (Banks 1953: 121, Perry 1974: 32, White 1975), but Witthoft observed that they were rarely eaten (n.d.: 40), occasionally being stewed or cooked into bean bread. g\u00e2lg\u00fbsk gatush - 'it ripens in winter, mountain dwelling' - Ilex montana Torr. & Gray ex Gray - mountain holly, mountain winterberry The folk generic g\u00e2lg\u00fbsk refers to the tendency of the berries to turn red and remain on the plant until late in winter. The specific qualifier gatush was a combination of gat\u00fas ('mountain') and eh ('dwelling' or 'growing'), and, as the common name suggests, this species is most commonly found in the mountains. Ilex montana will be discussed below, but is incl uded here for classification purposes. g\u00e2lg\u00fbsk saluyh - 'it ripens in winter, swamp growing' - Photinia pyrifolia (Lam.) Robertson & Phipps - red chokeberry The specific qualifier saluyh stems from sal\u00fayi ('swamp') and eh ('dwelling' or 'growing'), due to the preference of P. pyrifolia for wet ground. Mooney also recorded the synonym g\u00e2lg\u00fbsk tlaw\u00e2tueh , the specific being a form of klaw\u00e1tuh 110 ('growing in mud'); another reference to its preference for wet ground. There is no available information on the medicinal properties of g\u00e2lg\u00fbsk saluyh. galiw\u00e2d - Galiw\u00e2d was the Cherokee folk generic for the species of Smilax , the greenbriars or catbriars. Smilax pseudochina was ('black') due to the color of the stalk at certain times of t he year. He identified the botanical species as S. pseudochina , but this species is most common on the coastal plain and only occasionally encountered in the mountains (Smith 1998: 18). Another herbaceous species, Smilax herbacea L., is commonly encountered in the North Carolina mountains, but Mooney wrote that galiw\u00e2d g\u00fbnag\u00e9 was used as a scratching implement. The herbaceous species of Smilax , unlike the woody species, do not have bristles that could be used in such a m anner. One of Mooney's informants identified S. herbacea as anisg\u00edna-(ts)un\u00e2 ns\u00fbta ('ghosts' terrapin rattles'), a wild yam ( Dioscorea villosa ), but this may have been a misidentification due to the similarity of the two plants in t heir early stages of development. However, the informant did say that a tea of the roots of S. herbacea , combined with those of Collinsonia canadensis , was used for \"rumbling bowels\", which was similar to the use recorded by Banks (1953: 17-18). Will West Long told Banks that a decoction of the roots and vines of both S. herbacea and S. rotundifolia was drunk for bowel problems. While it appears that the Cherokee utilized S. herbacea , it was not likely that it was the 'black' species of galiw\u00e2d recorded by Mooney. He case of Mooney, or t he Smithsonian's botanists, identifying the botanical species as one that does not grow in the region. He recorded galiw\u00e2d tal\u00e2nige as Smilax smallii Morong, a species commonly found in the coastal plain and lower Piedmont, but not present in the mountai ns (Radford et al. 1968: 289). He also did not indicate why it was known as the 'yellow' species of galiw\u00e2d. He found that galiw\u00e2d tal\u00e2nige was used to cool the pain caused by a burn, but did not specify how it was prepared. galiw\u00e2d sak\u00e1nige - 'greenbriar, was known as the 'blue' species of galiw\u00e2d due to the bluish color of the stems. Mooney also recorded the synonym galiw\u00e2d klayuh ('greenbriar, growing in old fields'), due to its frequency in abandoned garden sites and fields. Mooney found that the root of S. glauca was pounded and placed in the hollow portion of an aching tooth. Olbrechts recorded several uses, including in formulas for dal\u00e2nige tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine') and utigad\u00f6 ('to drive out afterbirth'), and as a scratching utensil for a condition involving cramps known as dikanugosti nug\u00f6tl\u00f6 g\u00f6toti ('to be used with a briar to cause it to come out'). It was combined with Vitis aestivalis and used as a love attraction medicine and with Eryngium yuccifolium for \"insects coming out of wounds\". He also wrote that a portion of the stem used as a scratching implement to treat rheumatism (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 196). Banks (1953:17) added that the wilted leaves were used as drawing poultice for bringing boils to a head and that the bark was added to a decoction with that as a tea for \"bad disease\", a condition whose primary symptom was a severe fever. hay\u00fagt, uy\u00fagt or y\u00fagt - hazel-nut recorded hay\u00fagt, uy\u00fagt and y\u00fagt as acceptable names for the hazel-nut bush, and they all appear to be opaque, proper names. Olbrechts recorded that it was used in a formula as an emetic for dal\u00e2ni dikstoti occidentalis for fevers accompanied by shaking. The nuts were also cracked and eaten raw, especially by Cherokee children (Witthoft n.d.: 48a). igag\u00fbt virgin's bower The folk generic igag\u00fbt ('light') was due to the long, white styles on the seeds creating the appearance of a ball of ligh t. Mooney also collected the synonyms \u00fbtsat uwadsska-iy\u00fast unutl\u00e1eta ('a heavy mass ('it swells at the base'). Mooney found that a cold infusion of the pounded plant was used for the biliary disease dal\u00e2ni ('yellow') with associated dysentery. It appears to have been especially useful in conditions of the urinary tract. Olbrec hts found it used in formulas dal\u00e2nige they water out white'). Banks added that it was used for profuse urination and as a general remedy for the kidneys and bladder. He also found that an infusion of the roots 113 was drunk for an ulcerated stomach and the root was chewed alone or it was combined in an infusion with a species of Asclepias for back problems. It was an ingredient in the medicine if one got ill from eating t he first ears of corn (Banks 1953: 45). itsh or t'tsh this shr ub considered prototypical of itsh as both 'new' and 'green', so it may have been due to shade of green found on the emerging spring leaves. Olbrechts also recorded the synonyms at'tsh ('green') and tsaya (no gloss). Alnus serrulata appears only twice in Mooney's notes. In a formula for old sores and cancers, the bark was combined with that of Sassafras albidum and Carpinus caroliniana as well as the leaves of skw\u00e1l utana (see Herbaceous Plants, Part 3). It was also part of a formula used for sickness sent by animals who had not been respected by a hunter known as atawini ei ('the forest dwellers'). In contrast, Olbrechts found it used for a wide variety of ethnomedical conditions. It was part of an infusion held in the mout h of the medicine man for sucking out the affliction caused by adansiludoi yune istanel\u00f6 ('trailing along, if there is pain in different places') or the similar condition unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i or uneistaneo gananugotsidoi ('when they have pains all over their body'). The chewed bark was blown into the eyes of a patient suffering from aktoli yut\u00f6ya ('when their eyes hurt') 'when they have them drooping'), and it was part of a formula given to menstruating women known as andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'). It was used in an emetic formula for dal\u00e2ni dikstoti ('to make patient vomit bi le') and for an undescribed condition 114 known as dawzni e i unit\u00f6y\u00f6 (no gloss). It was included in formulas for gotisgi tsunits\u00f6y\u00f6i ('when their stomach ('they urinate all milk'). This is one of the few species that Olbrechts noted as a species cultivated by the Cherokee medicine men (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 91). Banks added several more uses to this list (1953: 27-29). An infusion of the bark was used for heart trouble, excessive menstr ual discharge, coughs, thrush in newborns, as a diuretic, and to bring down blood pressure while purifying the blood. A cold infusion in the mouth to heal an abscessed tooth. The roots of alder, Rubus spp . (a type of dewberry), and Pinus virginiana were made into a tea and used as a soak to relieve hemorrhoids. A to be a good blood tonic and a decoction of alder alone was used as a general usd\u00edga - 'green, small' ssp. crispa mountain alder Olbrechts observed the 'small' itsh growing in the neighboring settlement from where he was based. The identification of t he botanical species is speculation on my part because the smaller species of Alnus, the green alder and the mountain alder, are found at the highest elevations and are very rare. It may have been one of these species that was cultivated by the medici ne men (see above), as they would not have been conveniently located near the towns. 115 The uses her recorded were slightly different from those of A. serrulata . An infusion of the scraped bark was blown on the pat ient in cases of \"heat\", possibly a type of fever, and it was combined with a larger s pecies of alder to counteract the effects of eating food prepared by a menstruating woman. k\u00e2l\u00fbg\u00fbtliski - 'bone joiner' - Ilex montana Torr. & Gray ex Gray - mountain holly, mountain winterberry The folk generic k\u00e2l\u00fbg\u00fbtliski ('bone joiner') was used in reference to the use of the plant to mend broken bones (see below). Mooney recorded several synonyms for ('it ripens in winter, mountain dwelling'). The last name referred to the red berries that remain on the bush after the leaves have dropped in the late fall. Olbrechts recorded three synonyms based on an unidentified yellow quality of I. montana to the red berries. Mooney found that a decoction of the bar k was used as a wash to mend broken bones. Olbrechts also found that it was used in combination with Vitis aestivalis for broken bones and in ('yellow urine') and unisikwask\u00f6 with its use for 'yellow urine', it was with Rosa eglanteria for gig\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood'), as tskoya small, growing the Ilex verticillata (L.) Gray - winterberry, black alder Mooney did not provide a gloss for egwanulti-ehi , but Alexander recorded e quo ni as one of the Cherokee words for \"river\" (1971: 135). Other synonyms suggest this is a viable name for I. verticillata . Mooney also found that it ('bone joiner, growing by the water'), another reference to its preference for wet areas, and telan\u00f6 ('it has been shaken'), but he did not explain this name. Mooney found that the outer bark was scraped off and boiled for one to two minutes and drunk as an emetic for cases of dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). This was repeated for four mornings while fasting. Olbrechts found that, like I. montana , it was used for und\u00f6laks\u00f6\u00e7i ('broken bones'). However, he found that the bark of I. verticillata was chewed and blown over the previously scr atched area instead of being poured on as a decoction. He also found that it was used with or in place of I. montana for dal\u00e2nige tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine') and antasgiski tskoya ('insects are as well as for strange dreams during menstruation known as andkteg\u00f6 ('they are sweet-shrub Kan\u00e9lsk appears be an opaque, proper name for C. floridus . According to Mooney, Cherokee hunters would eat the seeds of kan\u00e9lsk to ward off hunger. Witthoft elaborated on this use, offering that, \"the seeds in the ball-like pods, which ripen in 117 autumn, are remembered as starvation-time food or stimulant, and are said to have formerly been eaten by hunters in the woods (n.d.: 51). He also determined C. floridus was the species referred to as \"strawberry shrub\" in a missionary report on Cherokee plants from the early 19 th century (Witthoft 1947). The roots were used as a powerful emetic and the seeds used to poison wolves. However, this may have been Euonymus americanus , commonly known as \"strawberry below). Olbrechts found that was used for the scrofulous condition duletsi ('kernels') when combined with Pyrularia pubera and the bark was used in an infusion with that of Xanthorhiza simplicissima for andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'). It a formula for dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine') and used singly for venereal disease of men and \"to drive witches about \". Banks (1953: 51-52) added that a cold bark tea, dripped into the eye from a rag, wa s used for those going blind from cataracts. The tea would \"take white stuff off the eyeball\" . A tea of the bark would also cure sores on children and hives on infants. k\u00fbnig\u00fb - Viburnum prunifolium L. - black haw K\u00fbnig\u00fb appears to be an opaque, proper name for V. prunifolium . The only medicinal application for black haw was reco rded by Olbrechts, who found that the bark was boiled down in a decoction with several other woody species for cancerous sores known as adayeski ('eating itself'). However, in anot her section Olbrechts identified k\u00fbnig\u00fb as Viburnum rufidulum , but this species is not common in the mountains. He was probably observing Viburnum nudum L. var. cassinoides (L.) Torr. & Gray, commonly known as withe-rod. Mooney recorded the name for V. nudum var. 118 cassinoides as k\u00fbnig\u00fb un\u00edgist, un\u00edgist being the plural of ag\u00edst ('food'), in reference to the edible fruit. Olbrechts found k\u00fbnig\u00fb was used for a dermatological condition known as uninidla ('crevices on the skin'), as well as in a formula for scrofula and in combination with otter's brains and rock water for tuber culosis. Banks added that an infusion of the bark of withe-rod was used to wash the m outh in cases of a sore tongue (1953: 121). k\u00fbnig\u00fbiy\u00fast 'like k\u00fbnig\u00fb' - Viburnum acerifolium mapleleaf viburnum The Cherokee classification of V. acerifolium appears to have been due to the inflorescence and fruit. The leaves are nearly identical in form and arrangement to the red maple, Acer rubra , and are often found growing in the same habitats, but the inflorescence and fruit are quite similar to other species of Viburnum . In this case, the plant was identified as being 'like' k\u00fbnig\u00fb and the resemblance to red maple was not acknowledged. This reliance on the inflorescenc e and fruit as criterion for classification demonstrates a high level of botanical sophistication. Olbrechts found that V. acerifolium could be used as a replacement for V. nudum var. cassinoides and was combined with an unidentified plant for the biliary condition known as dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). Banks added that it was an ingredient in a formula for small pox (1953: 121), but did not in clude the other ingredients. 119 k\u00fbnaglka unega generic k\u00fbnaglka stemmed from k\u00fbna ('turkey') because turkeys ate the berries that resembled the turkey's dewlap. This is unlikely, as the fruit of the azaleas is an inedible, dry capsule. However, Banks (1953: 101) and Witthoft (n.d.: 55) recorded that a gall of a fungus which on Rhododendron calendulaceum (Michaux) Torrey, probably Exobasidium rhododendri (Fuckel) Cramer, was eaten by the Cherokee to assuage thirst while traveling through the mountains (see s\u00fbnkt in the chapter on Fungi). The irregul ar gall, which is found on species of Rhododendron (Bassette et al. 1997: 467), could easily be said to resemble the dewlap of a turkey. Witthoft said the name was due to the arrangement of the flowers and leaves, said to resemble parts of a wild tu rkey (n.d.: 55), but his explanation leaves too much to the imagination to be considered tenable. Mooney found that an infusion of the scraped bark of R. periclymenoides was drunk to alleviate vomiting caused by over- eating the wrong foods. Banks, in reference to R. calendulaceum , found that a peeled, boiled twig was rubbed on areas affected by rheumatism. k\u00fbnas\u00fatlaw - 'tangled up' - Hamamelis virginiana L. - The gloss for k\u00fbnas\u00fatlaw was purely speculative on Mooney's part. Will West Long told him it might have been derived from akns\u00fadl\u00fbnk ('I am tangled'), but there was no explanation for the gloss. 120 According to Mooney, the green twigs of H. virginiana were combined with those of Lindera benzoin to increase appetite, relieve the pains of rheumatism and sore joints, and to reduce fever. The tea could also be rubbed in the mouth to relieve soreness. Banks found that a hot decoction of the bark of H. virginiana , the bark of L. benzoin , and the needles from Pinus virginiana was drunk to break a fever. He also found that the bark of H. virginiana was used alone as a hot infusion for colds and as a hot decoction to relieve a sore throat (Banks 1953: 58). 'hanging' or 'bending spp . - blueberries Mooney did not provide a gloss for kuw\u00e1ya , which he associated with huckleberries, but Witthoft said the same name was used for wild and cultivated blueberries and glossed it as 'hanging' or 'bending down' and suggested that it was, \"descriptive of the loaded branches\" (n.d .: 45). Witthoft said the fruits of G. baccata were eaten fresh in the field, but were not as relished as the blueberries. Perry (1974: 39) found that they were added as flavoring to corn bread and biscuits. kuw\u00e1ya-iyu st unielusati - 'like \"hanging\", with soft things hanging (L.) DC. as 'plant like the real kuw\u00fb', the suffix - ya indicating the 'true' or 'real' kind and -iyust ('like') indicating a resemblance to the 'real' kind. But this was probably incorrect, as ther e is little morphological similarity between the mulberry tree ( Morus rubra ) and the shrubby species he identified. The name 121 kuw\u00e1ya-iyu st would indicate a resemblance to the huckleberries and blueberries and I have chosen to use Witthoft's gloss for kuw\u00e1ya (see above). The specific qualifier unielusati ('with soft things hanging on it') would suggest that the species under consideration is Dirca palustris , which has hanging flowers that appear in the axils of the leaf buds before the leaves appear. Howeve r, as the common name \"male-blueberry\" implies, the leaves and inflorescence of Lyonia ligustrina are very similar to the blueberries. It may be that L. ligustrina and D. palustris are both types of kuw\u00e1ya-iyu st, but only D. palustris required the specific qualifier. Olbrechts found that kuw\u00e1ya-iyu st unielusati was used in with Aesculus octandra , and Corylus americana for cases of shaking due to fever. It was also used alone for dal\u00e2ni unitel\u00f6ska ('shaking dal\u00e2ni '). Witthoft added that it was \"recognized as a plant that stupefies animals and makes them ill, but rarely kills (n.d.: 60).\" kwl\u00e1g - 'bow' - Rhus glabra L. - sumac Mooney did not provide a gloss for kwl\u00e1g, but Olbrechts glossed it as 'bow', most likely in reference to the shape of its trunk rather than its functional qualities, as the wood is quite soft. Olbrechts also included woman that wanted her children to become witches would feed them nothing but corn hominy for 24 days. She would drink a decoction of Rhus glabra to start her milk flowing again after this time (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 130). Banks added that 122 a cold tea of the roots would make the milk of older women begin to flow (1953: 79). A topical application of a warm infusion of the bark of R. glabra was used to treat unawat\u00f6\u00f6ski ('blisters') caused by exposure to the sun (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 251). Olbrechts also found it was used for the back problem known as gayedi dreams associated with menstruation known as andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'), and the biliary condition dal\u00e2ni . Banks found that a tea of the berries and roots were part of a remedy for gonorrhea, the berries were eaten for kidney problems and bedwetting, a tea of the berries was used as a gargle for tonsillitis. He also found that an infusion of the roots was drunk for bowel problems and blown on convulsive patients (1953: 79). Witthoft found that the roots of R. glabra produced a yellowish- brown dye when used alone or a black dye when ferrous sulfate was added as a mordant (n.d.: 66). It was used to dye fabric, but not for baskets. kwl\u00e1g \u00fatana - 'large bow' qualifier \u00fatana ('large') was in reference to the size of the plant, which was the largest of the suma cs in the southern mountains. Like R. glabra , it was used for the back problem gayedi ('pain in the back') and for - frost grape Kwal\u00fas appears to be an opaque, proper name for both the fox grape and the frost grape, although Mooney identified it as V. vulpina and Olbrechts wilderness'). 123 Olbrechts found V. lambrusca was used in formulas for the urinary conditions andlk\u00f6\u00e7a as well as in combination with Vitis aestivalis as a love attraction medicine. When used for stopped urination, a special plant was sought that had its roots growing in water. Grapes were generally eaten fresh when ripe, but were also dried for use as a winter beverage. Segments of the grapev ines were cut and hung on a drying frame placed in the sun. In the evening the racks were placed in front of the fire. The dried grapes were stored in the house until needed, then they were placed in boiling water and the resulting beverage drunk with meals (Witthoft n.d.: 41). n\u00e1t\u00fbtl or dialect) or n\u00e1t\u00fbts (middle dialect) glossed as 'feverbush', but this was also the common name among the local whites and may have been unrelated to the Cherokee nam es. Olbrechts indicated that L. benzoin was the primary remedy for ganewot iski ('measles') and was used in a formula for gig\u00f6 yandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood'). It was also used alone for fevers and with Hydrangea arborescens as an anti-emetic. According to Witthoft (n.d.: 53), the winter twigs and buds were often made into a beverage, along with its use for colds and fevers. Banks added that the tea of spicebush alone was given to infants for hives or in combination with Cornus florida , Prunus serotina , and good corn whiskey it was a remedy for measles. When combined with the bark of Hamamelis virginiana and the needles of Pinus virginiana , it would cause a fever to break (Banks 1953: 52-53). 124 n\u00fbd\u00e2gweja-iyu st - 'like sourwood' fetter-bush The name n\u00fbd\u00e2gweja-iyu st ('like sourwood') was due to the resemblance of the twigs, leaves, and inflorescence of L. recurva to the sourwood tree, Oxydendron arboreum . Olbrechts provided the only use for this species, finding that it was used with other plants for a fever accompanied by thirst known only as \"heat\". nug\u00fbla - 'scratcher' blackberry Mooney wrote the following about the word nug\u00fbla, also known as k-nug\u00fbla, \"a general term for all briers and thorny shrubs, including bamboo ( Smilax ), blackberry, raspberry, wild rose, etc., each of which also has a specific name. The word, as commonly used, refers to blackberry.\" snaking along'); however the last name may be due to misidentification of a species of dewberry, which is known to have a prostrate habit (see below). He found that it was used in a formula for dal\u00e2nige tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine'), the root was chewed for thrush and as a prophylactic against toothache, and for \"heat\", or a fever accompanied by thirst, with Acorus calamus . Banks found that a tea of the roots was drunk for bowel complaints (1953: 66). Witthoft (n.d.: 44) claimed that the fr uit was usually eaten raw but that the Cherokee did not especially relish black berries. However, Cherokee men sometimes chewed roots as an acceptable substitution for chewing tobacco. 125 s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l - 'bowl' - Rubus ideaus L. - red raspberry Mooney wrote the following to explain the name s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l, \"Cherokees got the idea of the bowl from the raspberry, the bowl first called s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l but later abbreviated to tiw\u00e1l. S\u00fbn may be connected with us\u00fbnd\u00e2n ('a hollow log').\" But Witthoft (n.d.: 42) found that tiw\u00e1l had a more encompassing meaning including concepts such as bowl, mushroom, and, in the modern era, hubcaps and automobile tires. Mooney also used a similar term, taw\u00e1l, as the name for the life form category for the mushrooms (see the chapter on fungi). So the relationship between the raspberry and the bowl may have been less distinct than Mooney indicated in the quote above and this may have been a minor myth on how the bowl came to be. Although it is lacking the suffix -yu or -ya (indicating the 'true' or 'real' kinds), Rubus ideaus appears to be the prototypical type of s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l as the other members of this folk genus carry specific qualifiers (see below). Olbrechts included R. ideaus in a formula for andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'). The plants used in this case were the vegetatively-reproduced tip-sprouts from a second-year cane. Mooney thought t he preference for sprouts was because the new sprout was more bitter than the parent plant, but bitterness does not appear to be an important factor in determining the m edicinal qualities of Cherokee plants (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 246). According to Olbr echts, the Cherokee believed that the parent plant had lost its medicinal properties and the vitality was passed to the new growth (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 54). Banks recorded a specialized use for raspberry roots (1953: 66). If two sisters had babies and one of the sisters died, the ot her sister could successfully raise the 126 dead sister's child if it drank a decoction of t he root of red raspberry before it tried to nurse. Otherwise, the baby would \"sicken and die\". The berries of R. ideaus and the other species of raspberry (see below) were generally eaten raw in the field, the cooki ng or stewing of berries considered - flowering raspberry Rubus odoratus is found only in the mountainous region in North Carolina, hence the specific qualifier gatush ('mountain dwelling'). Both Mooney and Olbrechts recorded synonyms reflecting a 'large' aspect of the plant or its parts, Mooney recording it as s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l \u00fatana and Olbrechts as s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l egwa . only medicinal use for R. odoratus , finding that it was used in cases dunikstisg\u00f6i ('when they vomit blood'). Mooney and Witthoft both mentioned the commercial value of the leaves to the Cherokee in their interactions with the white herb traders. Witthoft wrote that, \"in 1891 the dried leaves brought three cents a pound 42).\" s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l usd\u00edga - black-cap occidentalis was considered the 'small' folk species of s\u00fbntiw\u00e1l. All information on this species was collected by Olbrechts, who found that it was a suitable substitute for R. ideaus for the condition andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction') and of the formula for dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine'). It was used aquaticum for uyos\u00f6\u00e7i e isti tsanan\u00e7tatia ('when they of the dead') and for painful urination. tel\u00fblat - 'it has them hanging down' - Vitis aestivalis Michaux - summer grape The folk generic tel\u00fblat ('it has them hanging down') refers to the hanging clusters of fruit. Olbrechts recorded t he bulk of the medicinal information about V. aestivalis , finding it used in formulas for adayunitil\u00f6 ('pierced by wood'), aniskina uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i ('ghosts and dal\u00e2nige tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine'). It was tsuniyotc e\u00e7a ('when their appetite gets spoiled'). It was also included in two formulas that were not discussed in the section on Ethnomedical Conditions. It was combined with Vitis lambrusca and Rubus ideaus for stopped urination and aestivalis in a formula for \"bad disease\", a condition associated with a high fever (see kutl\u00fb in the chapter on Trees). tsigw\u00e1gw - Pyrularia pubera Michaux - buffalo nut Tsigw\u00e1gw appears to be an opaque, proper name for the buffalo nut. The bulk of medicinal uses attributed to P. pubera comes from Olbrechts, who found it used in combination with Calycanthus floirdus for the scrofulous condition duletsi ('kernels') and to treat unit\u00f6y\u00f6 yiki uniskwali ('when they have a stomach 128 ache'). He also found it was used for the biliary disease dal\u00e2ni , which may have been related to the stomach condition. B anks added that the nuts were roasted and pulverized for use on old sores (1953: 35). It could be used alone or mixed with tallow and made into a salve. The pounded roots, mixed with bear grease, were also used to heal old sores (1953: 36). tsuwat\u00fana usd\u00edga - 'veins or sinews, small' - no botanical species Mooney described the 'small' folk species of tsuwat\u00fana (see below) as resembling a vine. It may have been Euonymus obovatus Nuttall, a species of Euonymus with trailing stems found in the m ountains. No medicinal qualities were attributed to this particular species. tsuwat\u00fana \u00fatana - 'sinews or veins, large' - Euonymus americanus L. - strawberry bush, hearts-a-burstin' Tsuwat\u00fana is the plural form of wat\u00fana ('veins' or 'sinews') and was in reference to the use of green strips of bark from E. americanus , once used in place of sinew to attach arrowheads to the shaft. Mooney found that a tea of the leaves and seeds was used as a wash to eliminate head lice and a tea of the leaves was drunk to alleviate painful menses. Olbrechts recorded the use of E. americanus , twigs of yunalstune\u00e7a ('if their urine is stopped') and in an infusion for young children when they suffer from awini uniyst osg\u00f6 ('they are burning inside'). tsandik digestive problems, it was combined with Vitis aestivalis for slimy diarrhea and with an unidentified plant for dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). Banks (1953: 81) found that a tea of the roots was drunk in cases of a prolapsed uterus, stomachaches, and gonorrhea. The bark was scraped off and made into a tea that was rubbed on varicose veins (\"cramps in the veins\"). Euonymus americanus was also included in a formula for \"bad\" disease (see kutl\u00fb in the chapter on Trees). ud\u00e2 - 'it has something hanging to it' - Aristolochia macrophylla Lam. - Dutchman's pipe The folk generic ud\u00e2 refers to the flowers, which hang on a long peduncle. The long stem and curved corolla give the fl ower the appearance of a pipe, hence the common name Dutchman's pipe. Olbrechts recorded A. macrophylla as ud\u00e2 \u00fatana ('it has something hanging to it, large') and described ud\u00e2 as a vine with cucumber-like fruit. But he did not provide a botanica l name for the latter. He found that A. macrophylla was used when one suffered from bad dreams. It was also part of the formula for dal\u00e2nige top off, large' - Aralia spinosa L. - Devil's walking stick Mooney said the folk generic ultsgt ('it cuts its top off') was a reference to the deciduous nature of the branches (they are actually compound leaves), which drop off every year. He mentioned that there was a ultsgt usd\u00edga ('small'), but provided no description of it and I know of no species t hat could be considered a small version of A. spinosa . 130 According to Olbrechts, a decoction that included A. spinosa was blown on a scratched area to treat paralysis on one half of the body. The other ingredients were not recorded. According to an early 19th century account, the roasted roots were used as an emetic, but the green roots were consider ed to be poisonous (Witthoft 1947). The roots were also made into a salve to heal old sores (Banks 1953: 92). ul\u00fbta - 'it has climbed' - Toxicodendron radicans (L.) Kuntze - poison ivy The folk generic ul\u00fbta ('it has climbed') refers to the ability of the poison ivy vine to reach high into the forest canopy. Mooney said that, \"boys spit on their hands and touch it lightly so as not to offend and say gnal ('we are friends')\". Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planchon was also labeled as ul\u00fbta and, while generally harmless, was thought to be mildly poisonous by the C herokee (Witthoft n.d.: 60). The dermatitis caused by contact with poison ivy was treated by rubbing it with the pounded flesh of a crawfish (Mooney 1900: might have come from uys\u00faga , the Cherokee name for the opossum, but he was not sure of the etymology. Mooney and Olbrechts recorded both the singul ar and plural forms for this plant and both recorded it as Vitis cordifolia Lam. While this is a synonym for Vitis vulpina , they both also identified it as the possum grape, a very similar species to V. vulpina . Uns\u00faga may refer to the distinct species V. baileyana , or it could be a synonym for V. vulpina . But because the common name possum grape was used by both Mooney and 131 Olbrechts and it was distinguished fr om both the fox and frost grapes (see kwal\u00fas above), I have included here as V. baileyana . It was used in much the same manner as kwal\u00fas for yellow urine and a love attrac tant, but was also combined with Vitis aestivalis for chronic diarrhea. unig\u00edna - chinquapin - Castanea pumila (L.) Miller Unig\u00edna appears to be an opaque, proper name for the chinquapin, a shrubby version of the American chestnut, Castanea dentata . It was used alone for conditions related to heat such as aniskoli didzstistoti ('to blow on their heads') and dunitsal\u00f6i ('when they have blisters'). The nuts are edibl e, but their use by the Cherokee was only mentioned in passing (White 1975) or as an inconsequential food for the Cherokee (Witthoft n.d.: 48). utl\u00e1sin\u00fbta or Rubus hispidu s name stems from g\u00fbtl\u00e1in ('it creeps'), utl\u00e1sin\u00fbta being the most common term applied to the dewberries but ut\u00fbnsin\u00fbta being the usual verb form for 'it has crept'. It refers to the prostrate habit of t he stems of the dewberry. Mooney identified the botanical species as Rubus trivialis Michaux, but this species is not common in the mountains. Rubus flagellaris and R. hispidus are both frequently encountered in and around the Cherokee lands. Olbrechts included dewberry in the formula for yellowish urine (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 253). Banks added that a tea of the roots was used for diarrhea and 132 dysentery and the chewed root would take the coating off the tongue (1953: 66). Dewberry, combined with Pinus virginiana and Alnus serrulata , was made into a tea and drunk or applied externally for hemorrhoi ds (1953: 687). The berries were eaten and used in the same manner as blackberries and raspberries (see above). uwl or uw\u00e1ga - passionflower - Passiflora incarnata L. Uwl appears to for the passionflower, Passiflora incarnata . Mooney found that the primary use was as a food source, the fruit either eaten raw or boiled twice and strained. Once the seeds were removed, the remaining pulp thickened with meal and made into a gruel called uw\u00e1ga ag n\u00fbh ('boiled apricots'). Banks recorded the only medici nal properties, those being associated with the roots of the plant (1953: 89-90). The pounded root was made into a warm infusion and this was placed into the ears to treat earaches. The roots were also made into a tea and given to an infant to encourage weaning. If drunk by the infant at six months, it would drop off the breast at one year of age, ju st like the ripe fruit drops off the vine. uwliy\u00fast or tsiyu-iy\u00fast - 'like passionflower' or uwl and -iy\u00fast ('like' or 'as'), due to the resemb lance of the plant to the larger P. incarnata . The second name, tsiyu-iy\u00fast ('like tulip poplar') was in reference to the leaves, which were considered to resemble those of Liriodendron tulipifera , known to the Cherokee as tsiyu. Mooney found that P. lutea was used for sore eyes, but he did not elaborate on this use. 133 Banks attributed the knowledge of a use for P. incarnata to Will West Long, but his description of a plant with a small, inedi ble berry suggests that he was referring to P. lutea (1953:89). He said that the pounded root was applied to sores caused by locust thorns and briers. This type of poultice would draw out the infection. walh\u00fbnega g\u00edgag\u00e9 - but Olbrechts glossed it as 'frog's skin' and sa id it was due to the pattern on the spotted bark. This may have stemmed from walosi , a term used for both frogs and toads (Fradkin 1990: 135), and ganega ('skin') (Alexander 1971: 146). Mooney claimed that this was called the 'red' species of walh\u00fbnega because of the color of the bark and the blossoms. No medicinal qualities we re attributed to this species. walh\u00fbnega g\u00fbtlat\u00fb h - 'frog's skin, growing on the mountainside' spp. The specific qualifier suffix -h ('living' or 'dwelling'). The exact bot anical species was not identified and it is not discernable from the description. The following species, Cornus amomum , is found in both swampy areas and alluvial woods (Radford 1968: 792), so g\u00fbtlat\u00fbh may be descriptive of habitat and not a different species. 134 walh\u00fbnega tluge-iy\u00fast - 'frog's skin, purplish' - tlug\u00e9 ('purple') and -iy\u00fast ('like' or 'as'), a reference to the color of the berries. Both Mooney and Olbrechts recorded this as Cornus stricta Lam., the swamp dogwood, but this is not common in the mountains (Radford et al. 1968: 791), while C. amomum is very common and usually found in wet areas. Olbrechts recorded the only medicinal application for C. amomum , finding it was used for the strange dreams associated with andkteg\u00f6 ('they are under restriction'). 135 Plants ganul\u00fbh as 'herbaceous' and claimed it was, \"the generic term for herbs as distinguished from trees and shrubs.\" The life form ganul\u00fbh constitutes the largest category of Cherokee plants and is the most intricate category in their classification system. This intricacy is ex emplified by the number of intermediate categories (10) and the inclusion of a large num ber of folk species and folk varietals. In fact, the ratio of monotypic to polytypic genera is quite low in the herbaceous category. Out of approximately 154 folk genera, only around 83 are monotypic and 71 are polytypic. These numbers are approximations due to the large numbers of synonyms found in the herbaceous life form, di screpancies between researchers, and the ambiguous relationships between genera and those that are labeled as \"like\" them, but they provide a general idea of the nature of the herbaceous life form. The high number of polytypic genera in this category skews the overall proportion of polytypic genera in the Cherokee classification system as di scussed in Chapter 2. The life form ganul\u00fbh also includes the greatest number of biologica l species of the life form categories with 275 recorded species. An independent observation of the notes of Mooney and Olbrechts would give very different perspectives about which life forms were most important to the Cherokee ethnomedical system. For instance, Mooney reco rded very few uses for woody species, 136 and from this it would appear that t he Cherokee system was based primarily on remedies prepared from herbaceous species. However, Olbrechts often observed multiple applications for the woody species and, except for a few culturally salient plants like tobacco and ginseng, generally found only one or two uses for each of the herbaceous plants. Had it not been for the co mbined efforts of both men we would have a very limited view of the range of the Cherokee botanical pharmacopoeia. Banks took a more even-handed approach and included a broad r epresentation of the various life forms, but without access to Mooney's and Olbrechts' archival materials he had a limited perspective on the applications of herbaceous plants. Unlike the previous chapters, this chapter will be divided into two parts: Part 1: Cherokee Intermediate Categories Part 2: Cherokee Herbaceous Plants The intermediate categories will include a few of the biological species that have already been discussed or will be discussed in other life form sections as some of these intermediate categories include trees, shr ubs, or grasses. The names of the intermediate categories will be in bold print to distinguish them from the folk species and varieties that are included in them. Part 1: Cherokee Intermediate Categories As stated in Chapter 2, intermediate categories are generally identified by a primary lexeme that indicates a salient f eature, usually morphological similarities, shared by a number of often unrelated bi ological genera. However, the Cheorkee 137 intermediate categories tend to be more inclusive than this, usually encompassing several unrelated botanical families (see Table 5.1). Of the ten intermediate categories, Table 5.1. Botanical Families in the In termediate Categories (with No. of Genera) Intermediate Category Botanical Families Botanical (1) Pinaceae (2) Ranunculaceae (1) Rosaceae (1) nine include members from 2 or more plant families. The most diverse category, \u00fanistil\u00fbist ('they stick flat to a hairy subst ance'), includes 13 botanical genera in eight plant families. Such diversity defies com parison to the botanical classification system, but demonstrates the naturalness of the Cherokee system. The natural affinities between these diverse plants were recognized and they were identified with the same generic label. This inclusiveness in the face of such di versity also required greater distinction between members of each folk genus. This is especially evident it the category 138 gnigwalsk, with three folk varieties of the folk speices gnigwalsk \u00fatana , but the varietal level of classification is also pres ent in several of the other categories. The index for the intermediate categories (see T able 5.2) pairs the Cherokee species name with the botanical species, as the polytypic intermediate categories contain too many taxa in each genus to be indexed by folk genus alone. Table 5.2. Intermediate Category Index : Botanical Species and Folk Species Botanical Species Cherokee Genera and Species Botanical Species Cherokee Index: Bo tanical Species and Folk Species (contd.) Botanical Species Cherokee Genera and Species Botanical Species - 'yellow' The name for this category is based on the perception of a pronounced yellow coloration of a part of the plant, usually the roots, flowers, or, in the case of woody species, the inner bark. Two shrubby species, Rhus copallina L. and Xanthorhiza simplicissima Marshall, were known as dal\u00e2ni , suggesting that they were the most prototypical members of this category. It is not clear why R. copallina is known as dal\u00e2ni , but it may be due to the color of the early inflorescence. It was also known as is commonly known as yellowroot due to the intensely yellow color of the roots. Yellowroot was a comm on dye plant of the Cherokee, imparting a 140 persistent yellow color to baskets, masks, etc. Other names for it included dal\u00e2ni amayutehi ('yellow, water edge growing') and dal\u00e2nige unastetsi ('yellow roots'). The other shrub that could be included in this category is a species of Ilex. Known primarily as kolagutiski ('it joins the bones'), Olbrechts recorded the synonyms gigage atat aski (yellow, red fruit). All have been described in the chapter on shrubs. The other plant from the life form category encompassing the grasses that was a type of dal\u00e2ni is Sisyrinchium angustifolium Miller. One of the synonyms for this species was dal\u00e2nige unastetsi kaneska (yellow root grass). It will be discussed in the next chapter. Three herbaceous species round out the intermediate category of dal\u00e2ni , and these are - Helenium autumnale L. - sneeze-weed The yellow flowers provide the basis for the inclusion of H. autumnale in the category dal\u00e2ni . Mooney also recorded it as ul\u00e2 usd\u00ed adsil\u00fb sk ('?, yellow-flowered'). Banks (1953: 130) provided the only recorded use for this s pecies, finding that the bruised roots of H. autumnale were combined with those of Vernonia novboracensis (L.) Michaux and made into a cold infusion. This was given to women who had just given birth and this would prevent menstruation for two years. At the end of two years they would menstruate once and this would signal that they were ready to conceive another child. 141 dal\u00e2ni ganul\u00fbhi gadus\u00ed-ehi - 'yellow, herbaceous, dal\u00e2ni adsil\u00fb sk gadus\u00ed-ehi ('mountain dwelling yellow flower') for C. major and pointed out that there were several varieties of dal\u00e2ni adsil\u00fb sk ('yellow flower'). On one of the two voucher specimens I observed at the Smithsonian Institution's herbarium, Mooney identified Senecio aureus L. as he identified as tsugwal\u00e1ga tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb ('round leaves') in his notes and I have discussed it under that heading below. The only other one he named was dal\u00e2ni adsil\u00fb sk tsulaw's\u00fatsat ('fringed yellow (L.) Britton ex Kearney). However, because Mooney pointed out that this was a type of g\u00fbnigwal sk, this species will be discussed in the section dealing with that intermediate category. Olbrechts also recorded a plant known as dal\u00e2ni adsil\u00fb sk, but he was unable to associate it with a biological species. He did record the names dal\u00e2ni unit a and dal\u00e2ni g\u00f6t aska for C. major , but did not give a gloss for either of the qualifiers he provided. However, all the Cherokee synonyms contain the term dal\u00e2ni , which indicates that this was a prominent member of this category. As with the prev ious species, the name was due to the yellow flowers. Mooney found that a decoction of the roots was used for bowel complaints and vomiting. He wrote that the plant was not dri ed, but located in winter by the dried tops. Olbrechts found that the raw root of C. major was made into a cold infusion and used for the condition uniskowldisg\u00f6i ('whenever they have diarrhea'). Banks (1953: 127) attributed a similar application to a type of dysentery with a greenish discharge, but only 142 identified the species as Coreopsis spp . Witthoft (1947) also mentions Coreopsis spp . as a plant that was used to obtain a red dye, which would correlate with the common name \"dye flower\" that Mooney yellow dock, broad-leafed dock, Rumex crispus L. - yellow dock, curly leafed dock This name was also mentioned for Xanthorhiza simpliciss ima above, but, as with the common name 'yellow root\" in the herbal traditions in the Southern Appalachians, it may apply to several botanical species. Rumex obtusifolius does have yellow roots, hence its common name \"yellow dock\", which it shares with Rumex crispus L. Banks (1953: 40) is the only researcher to attribute medicinal qualities to dal\u00e2nige unastetsi , but he identifies it solely as R. crispus . However, the herb diggers in the mountains of North Carolina made no distinction between the two when gathering herbs for market (Cozzo 1999: 114), referring to both as yellow dock, and I have observed R. obtusifolius to occur much more frequently in the North Carolina mountains than R. crispus . The two readily hybridize, further li miting the exact identification of the species in question (Radford et al. 1968: 405). The medicinal applications described by B anks were all attributed to the roots of the plant. Root tea was given to pregnant women to facilitate labor and it was given in late pregnancy to prevent the loss of blood dur ing childbirth. It was thought to purify the blood, especially in the spring when sores were slow to heal, and it was used as a laxative. As an ethnoveterinary medicine, yell ow dock was given to horses to alleviate digestive problems. 143 gnigwalsk - 'it becomes discolored when bruised' Some discrepancy exists with the gloss of gnigwalsk, even between the notes of the researchers and their published materials. In his discussion of gnigwalsk in his notes, Mooney traces the etymology to gnigwlih\u00fb ('it is becoming discolored by being bruised'), which stems from unigw\u00fbla ('a bruise'). This was said to be due to the stalk turning red when bruised. However, in his description in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees , he said, \"the name refers to the red juice which comes out of the stalk when bruised or chewed (Mooney 1891: 325).\" Olbrechts glossed gnigwalsk as 'it has become purplish' in his notes, but changed this to 'it is like clotted blood' in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 126). Witthoft (n.d.: 11) claimed Mooney and Olbrechts both published erroneous etymologies for gnigwalsk, and he glossed it as 'it is bruised', which is most similar to the glo ss in Mooney's notes and correlates well to his etymology. For the purpose of this work, I wi ll use 'it becomes discolored when bruised' as the gloss for gnigwalsk and will assume it is due to the change of color on the stalk when it is damaged. gnigwalsk dal\u00e2nige - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, yellow' or gnigwalsk klayuh - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, growing in old fields' - Hypericum punctatum Lam. The specific qualifier of the first name dal\u00e2nige ('yellow') is due to the color of the flowers. Klayuh is a combination of klay\u00fah ('an old neglected field') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). Gnigwalsk dal\u00e2nige was used in combination with three other species of gnigwalsk to promote delayed menstruation and to counteract the effects of 144 encountering or eating food prepared by a menstruating woman (Mooney 1891: 325). Olbrechts recorded H. punctatum as gnigwalsk uniskutati ('it becomes discolored when bruised, with seeds at the top'), probably due to the plant's having the inflorescence in the upper portion of the plan t. He found it was used with other plants for profuse urination, but he did not name them or the method of preparation. gnigwalsk elat\u00edgat - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, low' - Muhl. ('high'). Gnigwalsk elat\u00edgat was used in combination with three other species of gnigwalsk to promote delayed menstruation and to counteract the effects of encountering or eating f ood prepared by a menstruating woman (Mooney 1891: 325). gnigwalsk nig\u00e2l\u00fb itshi - 'it becomes discolored when br uised, that is green all the time' - Veronica officinalis - common speedwell Olbrechts recorded nig\u00e2l\u00fb itshi as 'evergreen', and this quality was part of its medicinal value. Veronica officinalis was given in a formula to women about to give birth. The belief was that the evergreen qual ity was transferred to the child and would impart long life (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 119). It was also used for unawasti ('he 145 gets cold' or 'that which chills one'), giv en to the patient as a separate infusion when they felt thirsty from a fever (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 277). gnigwalsk tsulaws\u00fatsat - 'it - Verbesina alternifolia (L.) tsulaws\u00fatsat ('fringed'), is due to the flanges or wings that appear on the stems and is the plural form of ulaws\u00fatsat ('fringed'). Mooney also gnigwalsk dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb bruised, large, fringed'). Mooney found t hat the root was made into a red colored infusion that was given after menses; however, it can cause weakness. He also found that it was used for a condition he called kay\u00e9t, a \"private\" disease he also called \"whites\". This may have been another name for gonorrhea. gnigwalsk tsust\u00fbn - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, that branches out immediately upon the ground' - Hypericum hypericoides (L.) Crantz - St. Andrews cross The specific qualifier, tsust\u00fbn ('that branches out immediately upon the ground'), has to do with the habit of H. hypericoides , a small, low growing plant with many branches (but see k\u00e2st\u00fata \u00fatana uyan\u00e9na below). Mooney also recorded uy\u00e1t\u00fbl), which Banks glossed as 'flat on ground' due to the low growing habit (1953: 87) . Mooney also thought that this might be 146 the plant one of his informants identified as gnigwalsk uyan\u00e9na ('it becomes discolored when bruised, a bunch of). M ooney also said that this was the gnigwalsk nig\u00e2l\u00fb itshi (evergreen gnigwalsk) that Swimmer used, but this plant is different from the one described in Olbrechts' notes (see above). Banks found that infants were bathed in a warm or cold tea of the roots, which was thought to give them strength and hasten their ability to walk. Drinking tea from H. hypericoides was also thought to cause a fever to break (1953: 88). Adair mentioned St. Andrew's cross as one of the plants carried by hunters and warriors in case of snakebite (Witthoft 1947). gnigwalsk usd\u00ed-ga - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, small' - Stylosanthes biflora (L.) BSP - pencil flower The specific qualifier designates this as the small gnigwalsk, and this is a low- growing species. Mooney also the names tough root'). Nug\u00fbla is often used as the term for the ceremonial scratching utensils and the latter two names are both due to t he toughness of the roots. Mooney said S. biflora was found on the south side of the mountai ns. He found that a tea of the leaves was used for dysentery and that a tea of t he whole plant was used to bathe the body of a patient with a fever. The bathing was repeated four times in one night. This was one of the four species of gnigwalsk used to promote delayed menstruation and to counteract the effects of encountering or eating food prepared by a menstruating woman (Mooney 1891: 325). Banks also added that a hot tea of S. biflora was used for menstrual irregularity (1953: 72). 147 gnigwalsk \u00fatana - 'it becomes discolored large' - Scutellaria lateriflora L. tlug\u00e9 when bruised, purple flowered') and gnigwalsk sak\u00e1nige adsil\u00fbsk ('it becomes discolored when bruised, blue flowered'). The flowers of S. lateriflora tend to be blue or violet, so this was probably a judgement call by Mooney's informant. Olbrechts also recorded S. lateriflora as gnigwalsk \u00fatan, along with the synonyms gnigwalsk egwa \u00fatana ('?, large'). Scutellaria lateriflora was used in combination with three other species of gnigwalsk to promote delayed menstruation and to counteract the effects of encountering or eating food prepared by a m enstruating woman. It was also used alone for diarrhea and combined with other unident ified plants for breast pains (Mooney 1891: 325). It was one of the plants used for the condition known as utigad\u00f6 ('to drive \u00fatana ukt\u00fb t - 'it becomes discolored when bruised, large, having seeds' - Scrophularia marilandica L. - figwort Mooney gave no explanation for the gloss of the varietal qualifier and provided no information on the medicinal uses for S. marilandica . He did record the synonym diyesatiski \u00fatana or d. egwa ('it gets dew on it, large'). 148 gnigwalsk \u00fatana ulaws\u00fatsat - 'it becomes discolored for this species, as opposed to 'fringed' for previous kinds of gnigwalsk with winged stems (see gnigwalsk tsulaws\u00fatsat above). However, this still provides an apt description for the papery wing-like structures on the stems of Verbesina . He also recorded the synonym unstalu he roughly glossed as it', referring to the same papery wings. Mooney wrote the following in his notes, \"Used much in warm decoction of water for easy childbirth, not common, very useful and very much in demand.\" Distribution maps indicate that V. virginicus is rare in the mountains of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 1119). ganitawa\u00e2 sk - 'it unjoints itself' The stems from ganid\u00e1ask\u00fb ('it is unjointing itself'). Mooney gave the following reason for this name, \"the dried stalk in the fall breaks off joint by joint, beginning at the top.\" This is not a la rge intermediate category, but there is enough internal variation to include it in this section. ganitawa\u00e2 sk usdia tlug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk - - Houstonia purpurea L. Mooney merely listed the Cherokee and botanical name for this species (Ms. 1894), but the Cherokee name and the botanical name are congruent here, purpurea and tlug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk both being descriptive of the purple flowers of H. purpurea . He 149 also recorded the synonym atsila ('fire'), but gave no explanation for this name (Ms. 2235). No medicinal qualities were attributed to this species. ganitawa\u00e2 sk usd\u00ed-ga - 'it unjoints itself, small' - Silene stellata (L.) Aiton - starry Mooney recorded two other synonyms for S. stellata , both of them variations on the plant's physical attributes. Because of its white flowers it was known as ganitawa\u00e2 sk usdia unega adsil\u00fb sk ('it unega adsil\u00fb sk ('it unjoints itself, white-fl owered'). This was the small species, which may reach a height of 1 meter, in contrast with the larger Silene ovata Pursh. (see below), which tends to reach a height of up to 1.5 meters (Radford et al. 1968: 447-448). Mooney reported the onl y medicinal applications for S. stellata , stating that, \"the juice is held to be a sovereign remedy for snake bites, and it is even believed that the deadliest snake will flee from one who carries a small portion of the root in his mouth (Mooney 1900: 426).\" In his notes he elaborated on the use of the generic ganitawa\u00e2 sk, stating that if one was bitten, t he dried root was beaten and made into a poultice or rubbed on the bite. It would cure t he bite if applied within 24 hours from the time of the bite, even if yellow liquid had st arted to seep from the punctures and the site was swollen. He also mentioned that a tea of the roots was drunk all day at short intervals for yellow urine. No special diet was required. 150 ganitawa\u00e2 sk \u00fatana - 'it unjoints itself, large' - Silene virginica L. - fire pink It was not explained why this is considered the 'large' ( \u00fatana ) species of ganitawa\u00e2 sk, as it is smaller than both S. stellata and S. ovata , but both Mooney and Olbrechts recorded it as such. It may be due to the size of the flowers, which tend to be larger in S. virginica . Mooney also collected the name ahwi kan\u00edg usdi ('deer knee, small'), presumably describing the joints of the plant, which resemble the knee area of a deer. Olbrechts recorded the only medicinal use for S. virginica , finding that the root was chewed as a prophylactic to ward off snakebi tes. However, in case of an actual bite the juice from chewing the root was blown onto the spot in a circular motion. The circle would be in a counterclockwise direction, symbolizing the uncoiling of the snake and countering the effects of the bite. There may be some confusion between this and the previous species (see ganitawa\u00e2 sk usd\u00ed-ga ), or perhaps both were considered efficacious for snakebites. ganitawa\u00e2 sk \u00fatana unega adsil\u00fb sk white-flowered' - Silene ovata Pursh. - fringed campion This is the larger of the wh ite-flowered species, as opposed to S. stellata (see above). Mooney only provided the name (Ms. 2235), no other information is available concerning this plant. 151 g\u00e1tats\u00fal - 'it has dirt in it' The name for this category stems from g\u00e1ta ('dirt') and ts\u00fal ('it has it inside'), which relates to the tendency of the roots to appear dirty after being thoroughly washed. Mooney indicated that some of his informants classified the components of g\u00e1tats\u00fal by habitat, while others classified them by size . But he did not record a large and small variety of g\u00e1tats\u00fal, even though he suggested in his notes that they did exist. All members of the intermediate category g\u00e1tats\u00fal are also members of the life form ganul\u00fbh. g\u00e1tats\u00fal - 'it has dirt in it' - Phlox ssp. pyramidalis (Smith) Wherry - sweet William Both Mooney and Banks (1953: 106) recorded this particular botanical species as identified by the folk generic g\u00e1tats\u00fal, but that does not necessarily make it the prototypical g\u00e1tats\u00fal. The following species deserves t hat distinction. Neither Mooney or Banks mentioned the subspecies status, but according to Radford et al. (1968: 873) the spp. pyramidalis is the only one in the area under consideration. Banks recorded the only medicinal used for P. maculata , finding that the Cherokee would bathe children in an infusion of the roots to make them grow larger and fatter. g\u00e1tats\u00fal-ya - 'true it has dirt in it' or g\u00e1tats\u00fal unega adsil\u00fb sk - 'it has dirt in it, white flowers' - Ageaitina altissima (L.) King & H.E. Robins var. altissima The suffix -ya or -yu indicates that this is the \"true\" or \"real\" type of g\u00e1tats\u00fal, or the species that is most protot ypical of the category. The name g\u00e1tats\u00fal unega 152 adsil\u00fbsk is also appropriate as this is one of the white-flowered species of Eupatorium that is found in the mountains. Mooney indica ted that there may be as many as four varieties of g\u00e1tats\u00fal unega adsil\u00fb sk; however, A. altissima is the most prolific of the white-flowered species I have encountered in the region. Olbrechts identified g\u00e1tats\u00fal unega adsil\u00fb sk as Eupatorium coelestinum L., but this is a blue-flowered species that is not particularly common in the mountai ns of North Carolina and was an obvious misidentification. No medicinal qualities were attributed to A. altissima by Mooney. Witthoft (1949), in a discussion of the Green Corn Ceremony, cites a 1818 article in the Raleigh Register that quotes then Cherokee Chief Charles Hicks as referring to the use of wild horehound as a medicine in t he ceremony. While neither man identifies the botanical species associated with wild horehound, Mahoney (1847: 227) identifies it as Eupatorium pilosum Walter, a species that resembles A. altissima . This species is rare in the North Carolina mountains and is predominantly a lowland species (Radford et al. 1968: 1059), but it could well be that one of the several species of white-flowered Ageratina or Eupatorium that Mooney encountered is the wild horehound mentioned by Hicks. In his introduction to the plant, Mahoney states, \"The wild horehound is too well known to need a description. The leaves are remarkably bitter to the taste. The leaves are the part used, and are a valuable laxati ve bitter tonic.\" While Banks (1953: 136) discredits this work as inauthentic, Witthoft (n.d.: 215) praises it as, \"the most genuine and sterling of Indian herbals, and has no par allel in the annals of herbal medicine.\" Despite the differing opinions of previous res earchers, I chose to include this reference because it is the only place I have encounter ed any mention of wild horehound. And if A. altissima was known as g\u00e1tats\u00fal-ya, its place in such an important function as the 153 Green Corn Ceremony would indicate a high degree of cultural salience and would have insured it was remembered long after its medicinal uses were forgotten. g\u00e1tats\u00fal agisti - 'it has dirt in it, to be eaten' - Prunella vulgaris L. - heal all or self heal Olbrechts indicated, as the name states , that this plant was used as a vegetable and not for medicine. Mooney, Banks (1953: 112), and Perry (1974: 44) also recorded this as an edible green, but Money and Banks also recorded several medicinal uses for P. vulgaris . These will be included under ts\u00fb below. g\u00e1tats\u00fal aniskutataski (uwetige adsil\u00fb sk) - 'it has dirt in it, ?, (? flowers)\" - Mimulus ringens L. Mooney did not provide a gloss for aniskutataski or uwetige , but the latter may be a form of w\u00e2tige ('brown'). However, this is difficult to reconcile because the flowers of M. ringens are lavender in color. Mooney also recorded unin\u00e2y\u00fagi ('rattles' synonym for g\u00e1tats\u00fal aniskutataski , due to the rattling of the dried seed capsules. No medicinal properties were attributed to M. ringens . g\u00e1tats\u00fal egwa gatus h - 'it has dirt it, large, mountain dwelling' - Ageratina aromatica (L.) Spach var. aromatica Mooney identified this biological species with a question mark, indicating that it could be one of several white-flowered species of Eupatorium (several of which are now part of the genus Ageratina ) commonly found in the mountains of North Carolina. Ageratina aromatica is botanically very similar to A. altissima . However, he did discuss 154 another species, Eupatorium perfoliatum L., and recorded its name as g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush (see below). This would indicate more than one kind of g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush in the Cherokee classification system. Olbrechts identified g\u00e1tats\u00fal egwa as a synonym for Eupatorium coelestinum L., but this is most likely a misidentification (For a further discussion, see g\u00e1tats\u00fal-ya above). g\u00e1tats\u00fal elath - 'it has dirt in it, lowland dwelling' - Diodia virginiana L. The lexical qualifier for this folk species stems from elat ('lowland') and h ('dwelling') and it does prefer low, mars hy areas (Radford et al. 1968: 979). No medicinal qualities were attributed to this species. g\u00e1tats\u00fal gey\u00f6h - 'it has dirt in it, grows along the river' - species unknown Olbrechts did not provide the etymology fo r the specific qualifier for this species of g\u00e1tats\u00fal, but he did give the general gloss. However, he gave no indication of which biological species this might be and the qualifier gey\u00f6h ('grows along the river') could apply to a wide range of water loving species. But he did indicate that this was used for the condition dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine') and purpureum and E. coelestinum , are mentioned in one of the formulas. One of these may have been g\u00e1tats\u00fal gey\u00f6h. The other use Olbrechts recorded was for \"dreaming of all sorts of things\" but he did not elaborate on the condition. 155 g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush - 'it has dirt in it, mountain dwelling' or g\u00e1tats\u00fal g\u00fbtl\u00fbth - 'it has dirt in it, dwelling on the hillside' - Eupatorium perfoliatum L. - boneset The lexical qualifiers species stem from gat\u00fasi ('mountain') and g\u00fbtl\u00fbta ('hillside') combined with h, a form of \u00e9h\u00fb ('it dwells'). As stated above, differentiation of Cherokee folk species was often accomplished by a qualifier indicating the preferred habitat of the species. These names appear mismatched with E. perfoliatum , a species that prefers wetlands and river sides; however, Banks also recorded it as g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush for kanatl\u00e1ntsk ; however tsusalt was glossed in two ways. The primary one that Mooney accepted was as 'it lifts itself up', the image raised being a person holding up their arms and resembling the joined leaves of boneset. The other gloss from Will West Long stemmed from tsisl\u00fbnyeh ('I am poking it'), as one might poke a stick into a hollow log to chase out an animal. A poking stick was known as gasal\u00fbnt\u00e1t, the plural of which was ts\u00faslt. This latter explanation makes sense in light of two other plants, Uvularia perfoliata L. and Triosteum perfoliatum L., that were both recorded as tsusalt for at least one of their synonyms. As the specific epithet for each suggests, the leaves merge around the stem looking as if the leaves are pierced by it. Mooney found that the leaves or roots were pounded and made into a warm infusion. This was used as a wash for r heumatism and for erysipelas, an inflammatory disease of the skin. A decoction of the leaves was also drunk for intestinal worms. The plant was dried and stored for winter use. Olbrechts recorded no uses for E. perfoliatum , but Banks found that a decoction, steeped for several hours and taken by 156 spoonfuls every hour or two, was used for colds and sore throat. He also found that it was used for fevers, flu, and as an emetic. g\u00e1tats\u00fal tsunikwitayuwani - 'it has dirt in it, no gloss' - Phlox paniculata L. - summer phlox Mooney did not provide a gloss for the qualifier for this Cherokee species and it has no recorded medicinal uses. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk - 'smeller' or 'it smells' Mooney wrote the following description of g\u00e1w's\u00fbk in his notes, \"The Cherokee make no distinction between good and bad odors. Th is is the generic term for all mints or spicy scented herbs and also for the muskmelon.\" Olbrechts glossed g\u00e1w's\u00fbk as 'the smelling (plant)', but I will use 'smeller' in all glosses. G\u00e1w's\u00fbk is one of the larger Cherokee intermediate categories. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk - 'smeller' - Cucumis melo L. - muskmelon The Cherokee quickly adopted watermelons from the Spanish (Goodwin 1977: 58), but there is less information avail able about muskmelons. As early as 1715, Longe observed muskmelons served at \"The Feasts of the First Fruits\" (Longe 1969: 40). What is significant about Mooney's observation is that muskmelon obtained such a high degree of cultural salience as to become the type-specific (Berlin 1972), the prototypical or ideal type, for the intermediate category g\u00e1w's\u00fbk. It was referred to solely by the 157 primary lexeme g\u00e1w's\u00fbk and it appears that the fragrant fruit was the embodiment of the qualities inherent in this category. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk am\u00e1y-ut\u00fahi - 'smeller, standing black' - Mentha piperita L. - peppermint There is some confusion here as to which botanical species Mooney collected. It was identified by a botanist as Mentha canadensis L., but this species is not known to the North Carolina mountains. The species that is most similar to Mentha canadensis is Mentha arvensis L., our only native mint (Smith 1998: 143), but one that is rare in North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 922). I have used Mentha piperita here due to the similarity of the names collected by Ol brechts and the probable misidentification by Mooney. Olbrechts found M. piperita to be called water') and tsudu\u00f6i ('smeller, that is standing near the water'), both of which are very similar to the name Mooney recorded. Mentha piperita was introduced and quickly established in cool, damp climates and thrives in marshy, wet soils. The other name Mooney collected, g\u00e1w's\u00fbk g\u00fbnag\u00e9 ('smeller, black'), was due to the dark color of the leaves and stal k. However, even this identification was questioned in his notes. He probably provided a specimen without flowers, which would make it very difficult to identify the exact species. Banks (1953: 110) reported Mentha spicata L. as the species used by the Cherokee, but it is likely both were uses as it is quite similar to M. piperita in form and habitat preference. Olbrechts' only recorded use for the mint plant was for a condition known as \"the heat\", probably a form of fever, for which t he leaves of the mint plant were boiled and 158 the decoction poured over the body by hand. Ban ks found that mint was taken as a cold infusion for an upset stomach, for colds, and as a flavoring for food and medicine. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk at\u00fbkiy\u00fast - 'smeller, like - Chenopodium ambrosioides L. - wormseed The specific qualifier for this folk species stems from at\u00fbka (lamb's-quarters, Chenopodium album L.) and - iyust ('like'), indicating both a physical resemblance and a botanical relationship at the genus level fo r the two plants. Olbrechts gathered several synonyms for C. ('it is used to kill worm with'). The gloss for the last one, the only gloss he provided, suggests its use for intest inal parasites but he did not specify this use. Dila is the Cherokee word for skunk, so dilaiy\u00fast, would be 'skunk-like', most likely referring to the plant's smell. He did record that it was used for \"the heat\", possibly a type of fever, by blowing a warm infusion of the leaves over the patient. Both of these uses were supported by the findings of Banks (1953: 41). Banks recorded three modes of application for C. ambrosioides for the treatment of intestinal worms. For hookworms, the st em and leaves were boiled down to a thick consistency and given to children in bite size blocks. No water was taken during the treatment. For general worm treatment, t he tops and roots were pounded and made into a hot infusion. No breakfast was eaten, and this infusion was drunk at intervals all morning. Another general treatment consist ed of the seeds made into a thick syrup and added to molasses. The warm root tea was also drunk in winter for fevers and a cold tea was used for colds and headaches, taken internally as well as applied to the head. 159 g\u00e1w's\u00fbk g\u00edgag\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk - 'smeller, red flowered' - Monarda didyma L. - bee balm The name stems from the deep red color of the flowers. Olbrechts recorded two uses for M. didyma , both conditions pertaining to blood, which most likely relates to the color of the flower. It was used for gig\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood') and the root was made into an infusion and sniffed up the nose in case of a nosebleed. Banks (1953: 111) also found it was used for nosebleeds, but al so found that a hot infusion of the leaf brought out the measles rash when all else failed. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk g\u00fbnatl\u00e1 - 'tame or cultivated smeller' - Salvia officinalis L. - sage This is the same garden sage so prevalent in Mediterranean cooking. It could not naturalize in the mountains of North Ca rolina, so it must have been propagated in Cherokee gardens. The Cherokee attributed no medicinal qualities to S. officinalis 'bridge', but stated, \"there seems no reason for calling the species by such a name.\" However, Olbrechts favors mesic habitats and could very well have been found growing by a bridge or \"footlog\" over a wet area. Perhaps the meaning in this case was associated with a specific location rather than a general habitat. 160 Mooney also collected the synonyms g\u00e1w's\u00fbk \u00fatana ('smeller, g\u00e1w's\u00fbk sak\u00e1nige ('smeller, blue') which he claims was due to the color of the flowers. But the specific qualifier sak\u00e1nige was more likely due to the blue cast of the leaves which have a covering of grayish hairs (Smith 1998: 141) than to the flowers, which are white with purpl e spots (Radford et al. 1968: 918). No medicinal uses were attributed to this species, but Banks (1953: 112) collected uses for the general Pycnanthemum species, and I will include these here as this is the first Pycnanthemum mentioned in this section. A poultice of the leaves, as with many other species of g\u00e1w's\u00fbk, was placed on the head for headaches. A tea of the leaves was used for fever and colds, as well as for heart trouble and to wash an inflamed penis. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk tlug\u00e9 (adsil\u00fbsk) - 'smeller, purple(-flowered)' bergamot The name g\u00e1w's\u00fbk tlug\u00e9 (adsil\u00fbsk) was due to the head-like clusters of purple flowers. Mooney actually recorded it as g\u00e1w's\u00fbk tlug\u00e9 but Olbrechts added adsil\u00fbsk. Mooney for , and the inherent in folk classifi cation systems, in the following statement: As a sample of the worthlessness of Indian specific classification it may be stated that this species was desi gnated, under three of these 161 designations being given by the same man, while another described the Pycnanthemum muticum as g\u00e1w's\u00fbk \u00fatana ('large smeller'). Olbrechts said the medicinal applicat ion had been lost, but Banks found that a warm poultice of the plant was used as to relieve headaches (1953: 111). g\u00e1w's\u00fbk Mooney did not provide a gloss for ud\u00e1lk, but the small size of H. pulgioides would explain it being called g\u00e1w's\u00fbk usd\u00edga . Banks (1953: 109) provided the only medicinal uses, and he found several. The pounded leaves were put in the mouth in case of a toothache or placed on the head in case of a headache. An infusion of the entire plant was drunk cold for flux and warm for colds, while an infusion of the leaves was drunk for fevers. The leaves were also rubbed on the body to repel insects. g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ud\u00fbns\u00ednid\u00e2 it - 'smeller, climbing vine on the ground' or g\u00e1w's\u00fbk s\u00f6ktoih - 'smeller, growing in apple orchards' - Glechoma hederacea L. - ground ivy Mooney claimed that the first qualifier, ud\u00fbns\u00ednid\u00e2 it, was derived from gl\u00e9g ('climber') and ul\u00fbnta ('vine'), providing a name very similar to the common name ground ivy. Olbrechts provided the second name and this introduced, weedy species would have thrived in Cherokee orchards. He also claimed that knowledge of its use had been forgotten by the time of his resear ch. However, Banks (9153: 109) found that an infusion of it was still used for babies with hives and for measles. 162 g\u00e1w's\u00fbk un\u00e9ga hoary mountain mint Mooney claimed that this species was known as un\u00e9ga ('white') due to the color of the flowers, but the white hairs on the leaves give the plant a frosted appearance, hence the common name hoary mountain min t. Mooney also recorded the synonym g\u00e1w's\u00fbk s\u00fbtl \u00fatana ('smeller, bridge, large'), which is appropriate because P. incanum is the largest of the mountain mints that gr ow in the North Carolina mountains (Radford et al. 1968: 919). He also recorded it as simply s\u00fbtl ('bridge'), which is relevant to another species that was recorded as s\u00fbtliy\u00fast ('like s\u00fbtl', see below). No medicinal or other applications were recorded for P. incanum . g\u00e1w's\u00fbk usd\u00edga - 'smeller, (no gloss) - Trichostema dichotomum L. - blue curls Other species have been referred to as the 'small' smeller, but this may be a misidentification due to T. dichotomum lacking much of an odor. This is one of the non- aromatic members of the mint fami ly, Lamiaceae. Without a gloss for utanita tsugwalag\u00fb nhi, it is difficult determining if this name has any correlation to T. dichotomum . However, both these names were recorded on a plant label and the botanical species identified by the botanist at the Smithsonian Institution, so it may very well have been a proper match. No medicinal applications were attributed to this species. 163 g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ustitl\u00e1h mountain mint The specific qualifier stems from the resemblance of the flower heads to the topknot hairstyle worn by Cherokee men, ustitl\u00e1h from the upper Cherokee dialect and ustits\u00e1h from the middle dialect. Mooney also recorded old fields'). The plant is called natsiy\u00fast klayuh because of the resemblance of the linear leaves to pine needles, stemming from n\u00e1ts ('pine') and -iy\u00fast ('like') and from its preferred habitat stemming from klayuh ('an old field') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). Mooney included a vague reference to its medicinal pr operties, saying that it was, \"used in preliminary medicine for general complaints and by others to vomit.\" flowers of B. hirsuta are white and speckled with purple, but they soon turn brown after blooming which may explain t he name. Olbrechts recorded this and two other synonyms \"footl og\"'); however he gave no explanation for the names and they may have been due to misi dentification or underdifferentiation (see g\u00e1w's\u00fbk s\u00fbtl above). He identified the botanical species as Blephilia ciliata (L.) Bentham, but this is a piedmont species and not found in the mountains. Assuming it was identified correctly to the genus level, the species of Blephilia that does grow in the mountains is B. hirsuta . The only medicinal application he recorded was as a remedy for 164 mumps. Banks (1953: 108) found that the leaves of Blephilia were used as a poultice for headaches. k\u00e2st\u00fata - 'simulating ashes' Mooney attributes the name of this in termediate category to the ashy appearance of the leaves. The name stems from kast\u00fb ('ashes') and ut\u00e1h or uth ('pretending to be'). All members in this category are in the family Asteraceae. k\u00e2st\u00fata gat aski - - solitary pussy- toes Olbrechts did not provide a gloss for the specific qualifier gataski and its gloss could not be found as a part of any other name. He also recorded the synonyms k\u00e2st\u00fata tsanin\u00f6ita and glosses. He did; however, record several medicinal applications, including its use as part of the remedy for unakanostisg\u00f6i ('swollen testicles'), for kidney trouble, and for a type of diphtheria caused by insect ghosts known as aniy\u00f6tseni ada n\u00f6woti and - iy\u00fbst, a suffix meaning 'like'. This was due to the long, blade-like leaves that resembled a green snake. Mooney also collected the synonyms k\u00e2st\u00fata sa k\u00e1nige ('simulating 165 ashes, blue'), due to the overall appearance of the plant, and k\u00e2st\u00fata g\u00fbnahita ('simulating ashes, long'), due to the long, slender leaves. No medicinal uses were attributed to P. graminifolia . k\u00e2st\u00fata t concolor (L.) Nesom The identity of the botanical species here is questionable, as S. concolor is rarely encountered in the North Carolina mountains . However, Smith names 29 species of Aster in his Wildflowers of the Southern Mountains and includes S. concolor (as Aster concolor ) as a mountain species (1998: 211). It may be S. concolor is the species in question or it could be one of several other species of blue- to violet-colored asters that are more common in the region. Asters are a taxonomically difficult group and it would be impossible to speculate on this matter without a voucher specimen. Mooney also speculated that this could be the k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk mentioned by one of his informants, but this could represent several botanical species (see k\u00e2st\u00fata \u00fatana uyan\u00e9na below). Mooney attributed a fascinating application to k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk and, while its identity is questionable, this woul d appear to be the most appropriate place to discuss it. When a warrior prepared for battl e, he would place the dried root of k\u00e2st\u00fata tlug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk in his pocket. He would chew the root before entering battle, which would cause the bullets of the enemy to hit the ground at his feet, and he would be unharmed (Ms 1894). 166 k\u00e2st\u00fata usat\u00fb lt\u00fb - 'simulating ashes, having leaves twisted around the stalk' - Chrysopsis mariana (L.) Ell. The specific qualifier usat\u00fblt\u00fb stems from g\u00e1talat\u00fb ('arrow') and might also be glossed as 'it has itself (to be) an arrow', as the leaves were considered to resemble feathers mounted on an arrow shaft. Mooney also recorded the synonym k\u00e2st\u00fata dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk ('simulating yellow-flowered'), for Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium (see k\u00e2st\u00fata \u00fatana uyan\u00e9na below). A warm k\u00e2st\u00fata usat\u00fb lt\u00fb was used for what Mooney referred to as a \"fit\", possibly an epileptic seizure, w here the patient had a dark, black appearance and their tongue rolled back in their mouth. T he patient was scratched all over and washed with the infusion. k\u00e2st\u00fata usd\u00ed-ga d\u00edyatal form of ugwalaga ('leaf'). Mooney did not identify this to species, only to the genus level. However, there are only two species of Gnaphalium common to the western North Carolina region, and th is appears to be the smaller species, Gnaphalium purpureum L. (now Gamochaeta purpurea (L.) Cabrera). In his notes, he mentioned that this plant was about the same size as Antennaria plantaginifolia , which correlates with G. purpureum when both species send up their flowering stalk. Mooney also recorded the name k\u00e2st\u00fata tsusd\u00ed-ga tsugwal\u00e1ga ('simulating leaved'), tsusd\u00ed-ga being usd\u00ed-ga , also calling this Gnaphalium spp . 167 be the k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk that Mooney speculated as being and a purple-flowered did not make this association. k\u00e2st\u00fata 'simulating - pussy-toes The the plural form of g\u00e1sakwal\u00fb ('round'), Mooney stresses is circular, not cylindrical, and tsugwal\u00e1ga , which is the plural form of ugwalaga ('leaf'). Mooney said this may be the k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk ('simulating ashes, purple-flowered') t hat one of his informants mentioned (see k\u00e2st\u00fata \u00fatana uyan\u00e9na below), but this is a white flowered species and that association is highly unlikely. In one of his later trips he collected the name tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbli tulawat\u00e9st (roughly 'growing in patches or bunches, it grows ar ound the white oak tree'). In his description he said it grew on wooded mountainsides in ri ch soil and resembled plantain, but with smaller leaves and not so stiff or glossy (M s. 1894). This is an excellent description of the genus Antennaria , and the description of the small leaves would most likely apply to the species plantaginifolia . He also recorded the name k\u00e2st\u00fata tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbli , but he did not associate it with a botanical species. Howe ver, this appears to be a composite of other names he collected for A. plantaginifolia and he mentioned that the plant was evergreen, and the basal leaves of A. plantaginifolia persist for much of the year. As a medicinal plant, Mooney found that tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbli tulawat\u00e9st was used mainly for dental problems. An infusion made by pouring hot water over bruised leaves was drunk 168 and rubbed on an area afflicted by neuralgia and similar swellings caused by a toothache. Another informant told him that the pounded root was rubbed on a sore tooth. It was considered a strong, bitter remedy (Ms 1894). As k\u00e2st\u00fata tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbli , Mooney found it was used for gayedi ('pain in the back'), the whole plant made into a decoction and drunk for 3 to 4 days. Banks mentioned different uses for A. plantaginifolia (1953: 126), citing its use as a decoction for the summer diarrhea of children and as an infusion to regulate excessive menstrual flow. k\u00e2st\u00fata \u00fatana uyan\u00e9na - 'simulating (L.) Hilliard & Burtt - rabbit tobacco There is a discrepancy over the gloss of uyan\u00e9na between this plant and gnigwalsk tsust\u00fbn (see above). Mooney originally glossed tsust\u00fbn as 'that out immediately upon the ground' and uyan\u00e9na as 'a bunch of', signifying a bunching growth pattern. Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium is an erect plant that often branches as it matures, so it would definitely not be described as having a bunching growth pattern and the gloss for gnigwalsk tsust\u00fbn may be questionable. Other synonyms ('witch'), due to its shining appearance at night. He speculated that this might be the k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk ('simulating ashes, purple-flowered'), but this is an unlikely match (see k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9 above) as the actual flowers are inconspicuous and the conspicuous 169 papery bracts are whitish. Olbrechts re corded it simply as the folk generic k\u00e2st\u00fata , and it may be that this was considered the most prototypical member of this category, and also as the synonym k\u00e2st\u00fata dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk (as G. decurrens ) in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees as, \"one of their most valuable medi cinal plants\" used for colds and in a medicinal sweat bath (1891: 325). However, he elaborated on the cold remedies in his notes and added other applications. For colds, t hey made a hot infusion of the tops of the plants and gave it to the patient. Another cold remedy involved pouring a tea of P. obtusifolium over hot stones while the patient co vered themselves and the stones with a blanket, thereby keeping in the steam so it could be inhaled. The beaten tops were also soaked in cold water and used as a styptic. It was reputed to immediately stop blood flow and quickly seal the wound. As an aside note, Mooney said the whites down in Tennessee used the same plant for dysentery. Olbrechts also found that it was used for a condition related to colds known as either unisikwask\u00f6 ('when they are coughing') or utiyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i yiki nundiwsk\u00f6na ('when they have a bad cough'), as well as for a type of diphtheria caused by insect ghosts known as aniy\u00f6tseni ada n\u00f6woti ('to cure their throat') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 261). It was a component of a formula used to scratch patients for a condition known as dikanugosti nug\u00f6tl\u00f6 g\u00f6toti ('to be used with a briar to cause it to come out'). The medicine man would scratch the patient with a species of cat briar ( Smilax glauca Walter) and rub a warm infusion of P. obtusifolium and Vicia caroliniana Walter into the scratches. This was repeated four times bef ore noon, the patient fasting during the treatment, for four consecutive morn ings (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 205). 170 natsiy\u00fast - 'like a pine tree' This is a small intermediate category, but it includes a wide variety or botanical species. The name stems from nats ('pine') and -iy\u00fbst ('like'), usually in reference to a plant having linear leaves resembling pine needles. natsiy\u00fast - 'like a pine tree' - Hypericum gentianoides (L.) BSP - pineweed Mooney stated the following in his notes, \"The English name, \"pineweed\", conveys the same meaning as the Cherok ee name.\" Mooney's comment and lack of a qualifier suggests that this is the most pr ototypical member of the category. No medicinal qualities were attributed to H. gentianoides . natsiy\u00fast gatush - 'like a pine tree, - Ionactis linariifolius (L.) Greene - stiff aster The stiff, linear stem leaves resemble a pine branch. The specific qualifier stems from gat\u00fas ('mountain') and h ('dwelling'). Mooney recorded two uses for natsiy\u00fast gatush (Ms. 1894). A decoction of the leaves was used to wash sores and it was combined with Hepatica acutiloba DC for diarrhea. Ionactis linariifolius was gathered and dried for future use. Banks (1953: 126) also found that the pounded roots were soaked in water and sniffed up the nose to eliminate excess mucus. 171 natsiy\u00fast klayuh - 'like a old Pycnanthemum tenuifolium Schrader Klayuh is a combination of old neglected field') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). This is another species with linear leaves. The medicinal qualities were discussed under the synonym g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ustitl\u00e1h (see above). natsiy\u00fast Aiton - sweet goldenrod Solidago odor reaches a height of up to 1.5 meters, making it the tallest of the natsiy\u00fast and deserving of the specific qualifier \u00fatana ('large'). However, it is the least pine-like of the category, having leaves that are more lanceolate than linear (Radford et al. 1968: 1092). It may be that its anise-like odor reminded the Cherokee of the smell of pine and it was not named for solely for its appearance. Mooney did not record any uses for S. odora , but did say that it was found in old fields. ts\u00e2liy\u00fast - 'like tobacco' Ts\u00e2liy\u00fast is a combination of ts\u00e2l\u00e2, the Cherokee tobacco ( Nicotiana tobacum L.) and -iy\u00fbst ('like'). Mooney wrote the fo llowing about this category of plants, \"Several other plants - including t he Lobelia, mullein, and cardinal flower are called ts\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like tobacco'), not on account of similar use or general appearance, but on account of having a similar flower and seed stalk.\" 172 ts\u00e2liy\u00fast \u00e9lat\u00edgat - \u00e9lat\u00edgat ('low') was in reference to its height, not a favored habitat. Mooney also collected the synonyms ts\u00e2liy\u00fast ('mountain dwelling') may have been due the ability of this species to survive in drier areas, such as on a mountainside. Some of the larger lobelias, such as Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica , are restricted to wet habitats. Mooney provided the only medicinal uses for L. puberula . The root was bruised, wrapped in a rag, and made into a warm infusi on. One drop of this was placed in the eye of a patient with cataracts or white scum over the eye. The process was repeated as necessary. The same preparation was sniffed up the nose in case of nasal congestion due to a cold. He also reported that local whites would place the seeds in whiskey and take it for dyspepsia. ts\u00e2liy\u00fast g\u00edgag\u00e9 - 'like tobacco, red' - Lobelia cardinal flower The specific qualifier g\u00edgag\u00e9 ('red') is due to the color of the beautiful, blood-red flowers. Olbrechts recorded the majority of its medicinal applications, but only its use for the condition known either as adansiludoi yune istanel\u00f6 ('trailing along, if there is places') or unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i or uneistaneo gananugotsidoi ('when they publ ished (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 216). He recorded several uses of L. cardinalis for related conditions including aniskina g\u00f6wanits\u00f6 ist\u00f6i ('when they have been made sick by dead persons'), aniskina 173 uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i ('ghosts have changed (the condition of patient)'), ayeligogi ('they have made it like it'), and geganesag\u00f6\u00e7i ('they have it caused by plotters'). It was also included in two formulas for gig\u00f6 \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood') and, combined with Galium lanceolatum , for bleeding from both nostrils. This association with conditions that that included the presence of blood was most likely due to a correlation of the red flowers to the red colo r of blood. Banks (1953: 123) also found that L. cardinalis was used to stop nose bleeds, but he found that a cold infusion of the roots and leaves were snorted up the nose, and that L. cardinalis was often combined with L. siphilitica for this purpose. He was also told that a decoction of the leaves was drunk to reduce fevers. Mooney only provided the Cherokee and botanical for L. amoena . The specific qualifier, sak\u00e1nige ('blue'), was most likely due to the violet to blue color of the flowers (Radford et al. 1968: 1007) and not to the overall appearance of the plant (see ts\u00e2liy\u00fast unkt\u00fbt below). No other information is available for this plant. ts\u00e2liy\u00fast unkt\u00fbt - 'like tobacco, The qualifier unkt\u00fbt ('downy') is due to the dense covering of pubescence on the leaves, while sak\u00e1nige ('blue') is due to the overall appearance of the leaves, which the Cherokee considered to be a bluish color due to the pubescence. The latter was not due to flower color as with the lobelias. Mooney may have gathered as many 174 synonyms as he had informants for V. thapsus . One called it ts\u00e2liy\u00fast dal\u00e2nige ('like tobacco, yellow') because of its yellow flowers. It was occasionally referred to as ts\u00e2liy\u00fast egwa ('like tobacco, large') as it is the largest of the ts\u00e2liy\u00fast, and ts\u00faskwan\u00fb n ('blanket') due to the fuzzy appearanc e of the leaves. Another name, referring specifically to the seeds, was ts\u00e2liy\u00fast unikwt\u00e9na or just unikwt\u00e9na, which stems from unkt\u00fbt ('having seeds or seedy'). This would relate to the massive spikes of seed heads that are prevalent in the fall, each plant producing an enormous amount of tiny seeds. Olbrechts added several more synonyms for V. thapsus . He found it was he did not gloss tsuskwan\u00f6woti , it appears to be formed by a combination of ts\u00faskwan\u00fb n ('blanket') and w\u00e2ti, a shortened form of w\u00e2tig\u00e9 ('brown'). This could easily be a descr iptive term for the dried leaves. Mooney recorded two uses for mullein, the first involving a poultice of the bruised leaves, sometimes with the root added, used to bring down swelling. The poultice was placed on the swollen area at night and changed in the morning. This was repeated four times if necessary. Dried mullein was also st ored for later use. A decoction of the roots was also drunk to aid with prolonged menses. The patient would fast all day on the first day, until dinner on the second, until mid-mo rning on the third, and not at all on the fourth day. The first year rosettes could be harvested through the winter as needed. Olbrechts found it was also used for swellings, especially swelling of the testicles (possibly unakon\u00e7\u00f6 - no gloss) and of the neck. As mentioned under 175 ts\u00e2liy\u00fast g\u00edgag\u00e9, it was used for the condition adansiludoi yune istanel\u00f6 (trailing along, if there is pain in different places') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 216) and also as a poultice for the condition aniy\u00f6tseni ada n\u00f6woti ('to cure their throat'). For the latter, the leaves were pounded in warm water and the infusion placed on the patient's throat by the medicine man (Money and Olbrechts 1932: 255). He also found mullein was applied to the rheumatic condition did\u00f6lesgi ('the crippler'). Banks found that an infusion of the roots was used for swollen glands, kidney problems, water retention in the legs, and fo r \"female trouble\", while the leaves were rubbed on the armpits for prickly rash. A decoction of the roots was taken for coughs and the decocted leaves were mixed with brown sugar or honey and used as a cough syrup. Like Mooney, he found that a poultice of the dried leaves, shredded and soaked in warm water, would take the swelling out of a sore. And an infusion of the leaves was drunk after a miscarriage (Banks 1953: 117-118). ts\u00e2liy\u00fast \u00fanistil\u00fbist - 'like tobacco, they stick flat to a hairy substance' - Cynoglossum virginianum L. - wild comfrey The specific qualifier \u00fanistil\u00fbist ('they stick flat to a hairy substance') is in reference to the seeds and, as Mooney pointed out, \"is a generic term for all burs.\" Most of the synonyms for this species are classified as a type of \u00fanistil\u00fbist, which will be discussed as an intermediate category bel ow, and it is only mentioned here to demonstrate the flexibility of the Cherokee syst em. This is one of the few examples of a plant that embodies the qualities inherent in two intermediate categories. The medicinal qualities will also be discussed in the section concerning the category \u00fanistil\u00fbist. 176 ts\u00e2liy\u00fast usd\u00edga - 'like tobacco, small' - Lobelia inflata L. - Indian tobacco The etymology of the Cherokee name here is self-explanatory, this being one of the smaller species of Lobelia . Mooney mentioned it in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees and stated that it was used with old tobacco, Nicotiana rustica L., to counter sicknesses sent by friends or rival conjur ers to test the knowledge of a medicine man (Mooney 1891: 369). The whole blossoms or an infusion of the blossoms of N. rustica, Cicuta maculata, and L. inflata were held in the mouth of the medicine man while he sucked the afflicted area. The fluid was spit into a bowl and an offending object, such as a stick, pebble, or insect, was located in the liquid. In his notes, Mooney mentioned two other uses for L. inflata , both from imbibing a decoction of the pounded leaves and roots for an emetic effect. Emesis was considered beneficial for fluid retention known as dropsy and for when the saliva was spoiled by a conjurer, the act of vomiting el iminating the spoiled saliva. This was one of several plants that Mooney found were dri ed and stored for future use (Ms. 1894). ts\u00e2liy\u00fast usd\u00edga gatus h - 'like Lobelia spicata Lam. Lobelia spicata is commonly found in mountain meadows and woodlands, so it was appropriately labeled with the varietal qualifier The L. spicata range from blue lavender or bluish-white (Radford et al. 1968: 178). 177 Mooney made no mention of L. spicata in his publications or in his notes, so the only extant references come from Olbrecht s. He found that this was one of the plants used to overcome conditions caused by ghosts such as aniskina g\u00f6wani ts\u00f6 ist\u00f6i ('when they have dead persons') and aniskina uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i ('ghosts have changed (the condition of the patient)'). Si milar conditions, caused by human agents, had L. spicata in their formulas such as ayeligogi uniyel\u00f6 n\u00f6\u00e7i ('they have made it like it') and geganesag\u00f6\u00e7i ('they have it caused by plotters'). It was a component in one of the many formulas for unawasti egwa ('big chill') and pain in the stomach area known as uniyeloisel\u00f6i ('pain about'). His only published report of its use was for a condition typified by temporary bouts of violent trembl ing and, in severe cases, paralysis. The patient was scratched over the seat of the pain and a cold infusion of L. spicata was prepared in a small gourd and is blown on the scratched area (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: - Lobelia siphilitica L. - great lobelia As the common name suggests, this is one of the largest species of Lobelia and indicates the source of the specific qualifier \u00fatana ('large'). It also favors wet areas, indicating the incentive for the second name klaw\u00e1tuh, which stems from klaw\u00e1tu ('mud') and h ('dwelling or mention of L. his notes as ts\u00e2liy\u00fast g\u00edgag\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk ('like tobacco, red-flowered'), the name associated with and more appropriate for L. cardinalis . He also mentions it once in his notes, recording its use with L. cardinalis for the affliction by ghosts known 178 as aniskina g\u00f6wani ts\u00f6 ist\u00f6i ('when they have been made sick by dead persons'), so he was obviously aware of the difference. This awareness did not translate into his notes. Mooney only recorded one use for L. siphilitica , finding that it was used in conjunction with L. inflata as an emetic. Banks found the greatest number and wide range of applications for L. siphilitica (1953: 123). A cold infusion of the roots of the great lobelia and L. cardinalis was sniffed into the nose to stop nosebleeds while a poultice of the roots was used to reduce swel ling. A warm infusion of the leaves was drunk as a cold remedy and a poultice of the crushed leaves was used for headaches. \u00fanistil\u00fbist - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance' Mooney stated that this was the, \"gener ic name for all burs. The name implies that they attach themselves to hairy subs tances, such as cloth, wool, or hides of animals, flat, i.e. along the whol e surface.\" The name stems from askil\u00fbisti ('it is sticking to me'). These plants developed a seed dispersal system that involved attachment to a member of the more moti le animal kingdom. Walk through a field or the border of a woodland in the Southern Appalachians in the late summer or fall and you will find an assortment of these hitchhikers on your pant legs, socks, or shoe laces. This is easily the largest and most diverse of the Cherokee intermediate categories. As a group, the \u00fanistil\u00fbist had a specific medicinal application. When a novitiate was preparing to become a medicine man, it was essential that he remember the knowledge that was being imparted to him. A decoction of the \u00fanistil\u00fbist, used singly or in combination, was drunk to aid in the proc ess of memory retention, memories sticking just as the burs stick to a hairy substance (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 101). 179 \u00fanistil\u00fbist-y\u00fb - 'the true they stick flat to a hairy substance' - Desmodium nudiflorum (L.) DC - tick trefoil The prolific, triangular, flat burs of D. nudiflorum , which inspired the common name tick trefoil, distinguish it as the \"true\" \u00fanistil\u00fbist, or that species which best typifies the category. Mooney also collected the synonyms \u00fanistil\u00fbist aniyat\u00e9na ('they stick a hairy substance, flat') and \u00fanistil\u00fbist tuyay\u00fanst ('they stick flat to a hairy substance, bean-like'). The specific qualifier aniyat\u00e9na is the plural form of ('broad' 'bean') and , the plural form of the suffix -iy\u00fbst ('like'). This refers to the resemblance of the blossoms and pods of D. nudifloru m to those of beans and peas, and this is appropriate because all are members of the family Fabaceae. The medicinal qualities attributed to D. nudiflorum were provided by Banks (1953: 71), who found that bathing in a tea of the roots was believed to ease cramps. Also, a decoction of D. nudiflorum and any other \u00fanistil\u00fbist that were encountered was drunk in large quantities and regurgitated to improve a bad memory. This was repeated every four days. The symbolism evident her e would suggest that the sticky burs would help memories \"stick\" with the patient, mu ch as the water from the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea L.), a carnivorous plant that traps insects, helps the patient \"trap\" their memories (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 101). \u00fanistil\u00fbist - stick flat substance' - Xanthium strumarium L. - cocklebur Olbrechts recorded the folk generic \u00fanistil\u00fbist for the cocklebur. The impression here is that, even though Desmodium nudiflorum is the \"true\" \u00fanistil\u00fb ist, X. strumarium 180 embodied sufficient prototypical qualities to be referred to solely by the folk generic. However, Mooney might have disagreed, as he recorded the names \u00fanistil\u00fbist uniy\u00e2nat ('they stick flat to a prickly'), and \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunitsiy\u00e1st tsunsd\u00ed-ga small'). The first specific qualifier, uniy\u00e2nat ('having branches or spikes') is due to the hook-like spines surrounding the seeds. These are also the reason this is an efficient \u00fanistil\u00fbist, the hooks making it difficult to remove the bur from animal fur. The specific qualifier tsunitsiy\u00e1st ('they pierce or prick') is a form of tsiy\u00e1say\u00e1\u00fb ('I prick or pierce') and tsunsd\u00ed-ga is the plural form of usd\u00edga ('small'). Olbrechts' only recorded application for X. strumarium was for itching, but he did not elaborate on the condition or the rem edy. Banks, however, recorded several medicinal applications (1953: 133-134). A tea of the roots was used for cramps and a large swallow of the same tea would dislodge a fish bone or other object that was stuck in the throat. A tea of the roots was used as an emetic for those with an upset stomach and the chewed roots were used on rattlesnake bites. If a child was fearful when a person was in their presence, that person could take a bur from X. strumarium and touch their forehead, then that of the child. The child would then want to cling to the person just as the bur clings to things. Also, when the top bur matured, it was considered a sign that it was near the time of the first frost. \u00fanistil\u00fbist andayal\u00fbgi - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, ?' - Agrimonium . incisa C&G (Ms 2235), but this species is not known to be found in or near the North Carolina mountains (Radford et al. 181 1968: 547). It may be one of several species that are found in the mountains, but probably not A. parviflora , which is discussed below. He did not provide a gloss for andayal\u00fbgi . No medicinal properties were attributed to this species. \u00fanistil\u00fbist ganida\u00e1skiy\u00fast ts\u00fantana - 'they stick flat to a ganitawa\u00e2 sk, large' - Galium pilosum ganida\u00e1skiy\u00fast ('like it unjoints itself) is the name for the intermediate category ganitawa\u00e2 sk ('it unjoints itself'). The combination of two perceptual qualities, bur-like seeds and disa rticulating joints, resulted in this name which included two intermediate categories. The varietal qualifier ts\u00fantana , the plural of \u00fantana ('large'), suggests that there was a small variety, and this is one of the synonyms recorded for \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga below. No medicinal qualities were to G. pilosum . \u00fanistil\u00fbist g\u00fbnag\u00e9 unastets - 'they stick substance, black root' - Arctium spp. - burdock The identification of this biological species is purely speculative on my part. Mooney referred to the plant in his notes as being, \"described as having large burs and large leaves like tobacco\", indicating t hat he did not see it and did not collect a specimen. But this description, along with the specific qualifier g\u00fbnag\u00e9 unastets ('black root'), led me to believe that this could be a species of Arctium , which do have very dark roots. No mention of its use was recorded. 182 \u00fanistil\u00fbist gatush - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, mountain dwelling' - Sanicula canadensis L. - sanicle Mooney only provided the Cherokee and bot anical name for this species ((Ms. 2235). Banks (1953: 95) gave a general use for Sanicula spp ., finding it was used for stomach troubles and colic. \u00fanistil\u00fbist sakanigiy\u00fast ukwal\u00e1ga - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, bluish leaved' - Desmodium canescens (L.) DC - hoary tick modifying ukwal\u00e1ga ('leaf'). The Cherokee name, the common name, and the botanical name are all descriptive of D. canescens , as the leaves have a covering of dense, grayish hairs. Plants with this feature are referred to as canescent, and this is what gives the plant a bluish or hoary appearance. No specific uses were attributed to D. canescens . \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsund\u00edwatl\u00fag - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, swallowtailed' - Bidens frondosa L. - Spanish needles Mooney recorded two forms of the specific qualifier, tsund\u00edwatl\u00fag from the Upper Cherokee dialect and tsundigw\u00e1ntsg from the Middle Cherokee dialect. Both stem from the plural form of ud\u00edgwantlg ('it is pronged or swallowtailed'), due to the forked barbs on the end of the seeds. Olbrechts recorded B. frondosa as \u00fanistil\u00fbist tl\u00e2gesh ('they stick flat to a hairy substance, growing in fields'). The specific qualifier tl\u00e2gesh ('growing in fields') stems from klag\u00e9s ('field'), but the difference in s pelling was not explained by Mooney or Olbrechts. No further information was available for B. frondosa . 183 \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunitsiy\u00e1st ts\u00fantana - 'they stick a hairy substance, prickly, large' - Datura stramonium L. - jimson weed This is the Cherokee \"large\" counterpart to Xanthium strumarium , known to the Cherokee as \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunitsiy\u00e1st tsunsd\u00ed-ga ('they stick flat to a hairy substance, small') (see \u00fanistil\u00fbist above). The specific qualifier tsunitsiy\u00e1st ('they pierce or prick') is a form or pierce') and the varietal is the plural form of \u00fatana ('large'). This is due to the size of the seedpods, the spiny capsules of D. stramonium being significantly larger than the heads of X. strumarium . Banks provided the only medicinal uses for D. stramonium , finding that the dried leaves were used for asthma and the wilted leaves were used as a poultice on boils. \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga - 'they stick flat to hairy substance, small' or \u00fanistil\u00fbist ganida\u00e1skiy\u00fast tsunsd\u00edga - 'they stick flat to hairy substance, like ganitawa\u00e2 sk, small' - Lespedeza repens (L.) Barton - bush clover Mooney simply stated that this was the 'small u.' or the ' u. like ganitawa\u00e2 sk, small'. The second qualifier was already discussed under \u00fanistil\u00fbist ganida\u00e1skiy\u00fast ts\u00fantana above. No further information is available on the Cherokee relationship to this plant. \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga \u00fanat - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, small, attached' - Hackelia virginiana (L.) I. M. Johnson - beggar's lice or Cynoglossum virginianum L. - wild comfrey Identification of the botanica l species associated with \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga \u00fanat is difficult due to lack of congruence bet ween the notes of Mooney and Olbrechts and 184 the number of synonyms that were collected. Mooney does not mention C. virginianum at all, only discussing H. virginiana , and Olbrechts only mentions H. virginiana in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts also collected the synonym kanats\u00edstaga ugatsalagisti , but gave no gloss for this name. Both collected the name \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga \u00fanat , as is the plural of usd\u00edga ('small'), the plural form indicating that this was in reference to the seeds. According to Mooney, the H. virginiana was used for cancer, the dry root burned and the ash mixed with bear grease to make an ointment. The ointment was spread on the cancerous lesion, followed by sprinkling some of the pulverized dry root on top of the ointment. The plant was harvested in the summer because it had to be harvested by being pulled up by the top. There was a taboo against digging the roots. It was then dried for future use. Mooney also found that the plant was used for kidney troubles that included whitish (or milky) urine. It was boil ed down four times until it became a thick syrup and was drunk for four days while abstaining from salt. Olbrechts mentions both botanical s pecies in his published work (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 174), However, he does not mention H. virginiana in his notes and describes C. virginianum in two places. His process of identification fo r botanical species is not as transparent as Mooney's and it is impossible to discern if t he inconsistencies for species reported in his notes were intentional or misidentifications. Besides the synonym ts\u00e2liy\u00fast \u00fanistil\u00fbist ('like tobacco, they stick flat to a hairy substance') that was discussed above, he found 185 that C. including for tsuniyotogia ('when they itch'), the only published account of an applicat ion for this plant by Olbrechts (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 174). Olbrechts also re corded that the ashes of the burned, pounded root spread over all kinds of sores, very much the same as Mooney's finding. Banks recorded that C. virginianum was one of the alternate plants used by Will West Long in his version of the Green Corn Ceremony (1953:155). He also found that the root was used for cancer and it was one of the \u00fanistil\u00fbist described above used to improve memory (1953: 107). \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsuwat\u00e9st - 'they stick flat to a hairy subs tance, it grows around the stalk' - not explain the specific qualifier tsuwat\u00e9st ('it grows around the stalk'), but it could possibly be due to t he manner in which the flowers tend to open and mature in a spiral pattern on the stalk. No further information was available on the Cherokee association with this species. 186 \u00fanistil\u00fbist unati usdi - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, attached, small' - Lespedeza violacea (L.) Persoon The Cherokee name is a rearrangement of \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsunsd\u00edga \u00fanat above and most likely has the same meaning, a referenc e to small, bur-like seeds. The species of Lespedeza identified here is questionable as this s pecies is not found in the mountains of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 615). It is probably another one of several species of Lespedeza that are common to the region. However, it was mentioned in a list of Cherokee names paired with biologica l species (Ms. 2235), therefore it warranted inclusion in this section. unistil\u00fbist unats\u00fbwel - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, they stand up along side the stalk' or \u00fanistil\u00fbist unad\u00e9hyat - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, they surround the stalk' - Phaseolus vulgaris L. - kidney bean The specific qualifiers unats\u00fbwel ('they stand up along side the stalk') and unad\u00e9hyat ('they surround the stalk') must refer to the bean pods, although I am not sure if the pods of kidney beans stick to clothing more so than the pods of other beans. However, the generic term for beans is t\u00faya, so beans in general will be discussed under that heading. Unats\u00fbwel and unad\u00e9hyat are the plural forms of uts\u00fbwel ('it stands up along side the stalk') and uwad\u00e9hyat ('it surrounds the stalk'), respectively. 187 \u00fanistil\u00fbist unil\u00fbtigwin\u00fb - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, cylindrical' - Bidens bipinnata L. - Spanish needles The specific qualifier unil\u00fbtigwin\u00fb is the plural form of gal\u00fbtigwin\u00fb ('cylindrical'). The seeds of B. bipinnata are slender and cylindrical, quite different from the double pronged, flattened seed of its sister species, B. frondosa (see \u00fanistil\u00fbist tsund\u00edwatl\u00fag - 'they stick flat to a hairy substance, swallowtailed'). No Cherokee applications were attributed to B. bipinnata . \u00fanistil\u00fbist uniw\u00e1sg l - 'they stick substance, velvety' - Aiton - agrimony The ('velvety') the plural form of uw\u00e1sgl ('it is soft, downy, or velvety') and relates to the pubescent underside of the leaf. Mooney also collected the ig\u00e2tenh ('swamp growing u.'), stemming from ig\u00e2t plural of h ('living' or 'dwelling'). Agrimonia parviflora is known to favor river bottoms and mars hy habitats (Radford et al. 1968: 547). as Agrimonia stricta Michx., but this is a northern species not found in the North Carolina m ountains. This could possible be one of the smaller species of Agrimonia , such as Agrimonia gryposepala Wallroth or that are common to the region. Olbrechts also claimed that the roots of A. parviflora had a special name and were referred to as kanats\u00edstaga usd\u00edga 188 g\u00fbtl\u00fbth ('k., small, dwelling on the hillside'). These roots were used specifically for diarrhea, but his notes indicate that th is specificity only applied to the condition uniskowldisg\u00f6i uy\u00f6nskil\u00f6tiiyusti ('when they have diarrhea and discharge light colored feces'). Medicinally, Olbrechts found that A. parviflora was used for diarrhea and to relieve coughs. Besides the diarrheal condi tion mentioned above, he also reported it used for general diarrhea known as uniskowldisg\u00f6i ('whenever they have diarrhea'). As a cough remedy it was applied to utiyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i yiki nundiwsk\u00f6na ('when they have a bad cough') and unisikwask\u00f6 ('when they are coughing'). Banks also found it was used for bowel troubles, but he also found that it wa s given to children to alleviate hunger pangs in times of food shortage (1953: 60). \u00fbnag\u00e9 - 'black' Mooney discussed the category \u00fbnag\u00e9 in the following manner, \" \u00dbnag\u00e9 ('black') is the name applied to a number of species on account of the black color of some part of the plant - root, bark, or leaf. Besides the balsam tree, informants gave 5 varieties of \u00fbnag\u00e9.\" The balsam is a woody species and was discussed in the chapter on trees under the heading \u00fbnag\u00e9 (Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poiret). The - Agrimonia spp . The genus Agrimonia has been discussed above (see \u00fanistil\u00fbist uniw\u00e1sg l), but is included here because Mooney found \u00fbnag\u00e9 was a general term used for these 189 plants. The reference had to do with the co lor of the roots. Mooney also recorded Cassia marilandica L. as \u00fbnag\u00e9 in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 325), but identified it with modifiers in his notes (see \u00fbnag\u00e9 k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast unastets below). k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast - 'woody black like black locust' - no species identified The etymology of the name stems from t ('wood') and k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast ('like black locust'), a combination of k\u00fblkw\u00e9gti locust', chapter on trees) and as 'like' or 'as'). The qualifier k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast is due to the structure of the leaves, which closely re semble those of black locust. Mooney named two species in his notes Cassia marilandica L. and Amorpha fruticosa L.; however, of the two, only A. fruticosa is woody. I have viewed Amorpha in the field and thought I was encountering a y oung black locust. Also, Mooney identified the following Cherokee species in this series as C. marilandica , suggesting that this is a different species. But in the description in his notes he said that \u00fbnag\u00e9 t k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast was around four feet tall with yellow flowers and was the tallest variety of \u00fbnag\u00e9. Amorpha fruticosa , while growing taller than C. marilandica has purple flowers. Olbrechts identified C. marilandica as k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast among other names (see below) but does not mention Amorpha . Therefore, the botanical species here remains illusive. In a side note, Mooney said that the roots of k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast were pounded and soaked in cold water, and the resulting infusion drunk for sore eyes. 190 \u00fbnag\u00e9 k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast unastets - 'black root, marilandica L. - wild senna The name was due to the black roots of the plant, stemming from \u00fbnag\u00e9 ('black') and unastets ('root'), and the resemblance of to k\u00fblkw\u00e9gti ('black locust'). Both Mooney and Olbrechts recorded this as simply k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast (see above), but Olbrechts recorded the synonym \u00fbnag\u00e9 or also referred to C. marilandica as \u00fbnag\u00e9 in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 325), but this is incongruent with his notes. Mooney recorded several uses for Cassia marilandica , the most specific from The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 325). The pounded root was made into an ointment and used as a wash for sores, as well as being steeped in hot water and drunk for fevers. A decoction of the pounded roots was used for a condition that, like the plant, was known as \u00fbnag\u00e9 due to the patient having black circles around the eyes and a black coloration of the hands. It could also manifest as partial paralysis and black patches appearing on the arms, legs, and sides of the patient. The decoction was drunk several times throughout the day with no dietary restrictions. In a separate section of his notes, he also recorded that a tea of the whole plant of C. marilandica was used with Cassia nictitans (see below) for spasms in infants and in combination with other unnamed plants for scratching (Ms 1894). The pl ant was also dried for future use. Olbrechts recorded the use of C. marilandica for several Cherokee ethnomedical conditions including the scrofulous ('kernels'), painful urination known as eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i (no heart attacks known as usonuli unt ane\u00f6 ('sudden attack'). 191 Banks (1953: 70) found that a tea of the leaves was used as a laxative, while a tea of the roots alleviated high fevers in ch ildren. Unspecified parts of the plant were made into tea for fainting spells, cramps, and as part of a formula for pneumonia. To cure a sprained arm, the patient would attemp t to pull the plant up by its roots with the sore arm. It was unlikely that the effort woul d be successful, but if it was, the arm would be cured. \u00fbnag\u00e9 klayuh - 'black, growing in old fields' - Cassia nictitans L. - wild sensitive plant Klayuh is a combination of klay\u00fah ('an old neglected field') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). This is appropriate as Cassia nictitans favors roadsides, fields, and waste areas (Radford et al. 1968: 578). Mooney reco rded that a tea of the whole plant was used in combination with Cassia marilandica for spasms in infants (Ms 1894). The plant was dried for future use. \u00fbnag\u00e9 tsul\u00e1tsk\u00ed - 'forked black' specific (forked) was due to the ('rabbit eye'). Both of these names were likely descriptive of the cylindrical fruiting head. The only medicinal use was recorded by Banks (1953: 44) who found that a tea of the roots was used for whooping cough. 192 Part 2: Cherokee Herbaceous Plants The polytypic genera in the remainder of the herbaceous life form are not classified down to the varietal level as are those in the intermediate categories. While there are still a large number of polytypic genera, they tend to be limited to two members. The most common specific qualifie rs indicate, as Mooney pointed out, a large and a small kind, with ecological niche and fl ower color also frequently indicated (see the discussion of specific and varietal categor ies in Chapter 2). Each of the polytypic genera tends to be associated with a single botanical genus (see Table 5.3). There are a few polytypic genera that include several folk species which are associated with polytypic botanical genera. For example, si x of the seven members of the botanical genus Viola are associated with species of the folk genus dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk . Four of the five members of the botanical genus Aureolaria are associated with species of the folk genus dilastag\u00edst . While these tend to be the exception, they reflect a close association of the classification of taxa in the herbaceous life form to the botanical classification system. Not all botanical genera are clearly linguist ically related in the Cherokee system. Three members of the genus Asclepias are labeled with different names as monotypic genera. There is little indication that the mem bers of this genus held any special cultural significance for the Cherokee, so it is uncl ear why they would not be labled as the same folk genera. But this exception is also uncommon. 193 Table 5.3. Herbaceous Plant Index: Botanical Species and Folk Genera Botanical Species Cherokee Genus Botanical Species Cherokee Bot anical Species and Folk Genera (continued) Botanical Species Cherokee Genus Botanical Species Cherokee Index: Bot anical Species and Folk Genera (continued) Botanical Species Folk Genera wapato When he described this plant, Olbrechts identified it with a question mark (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 31-31). It appeared that he was unsure of the botanical species, and from his description of the sca rcity of the plant he may very well be mistaken. The name was descriptive of the appearance of the plant, which was said to look somewhat like a beetle with the st alk coming out of its mouth. However, S. latifolia is common in the North Carolina mountains, so this may have been one of the less common species. The discussion of aoi ye\u00f6ski in The Swimmer Manuscript contends that it was the species used to impart supernatural power s on a child and make them into a witch. 196 If an infusion of the plant was drunk for four consecutive days, it would impart the power to metamorphose into another person or animal. If drunk for seven days, the drinker would gain the power to become an animal that flies through the air or burrows underground. These are the most powerful of t he witches. The same infusion of the root of aoi ye\u00f6ski, if drunk for seven days while fasting until sunset, allowed a person to see a witch in their human form and shoot them. The only other medicinal use was attr ibuted to Banks (1953:8), who found that bathing a child in the tea of the leaves of S. latifolia would reduce a persistent fever. The child would also take a sip of the tea. \u00e1hw-kt elath - 'lowland growing deer eye' - Rudbeckia fulgida Aiton The folk \u00e1hw ('deer') and kt ('eye'). The specific qualifier elath stems from elat ('lowland') and h ('dwelling'), presumably due to the species preference for lower elevations. Mooney recorded the only Cherokee uses for R. fulgida , publishing some of his data in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (Mooney 1891: 327), while augmenting the processing technique for a few of the uses in his notes. However, he just called it \u00e1hw-kt in his notes, and the application might apply to the next two species. He found that a decoction of the roots was used as a wash for snakebites and for swelling caused by worms sent by a conjurer. For dysentery, cold water was poured over the pounded roots and this was drunk until the sym ptoms dissipated. The root was dried and kept for \"private\" diseases. A strong tea was made by pouring hot water over the 197 pounded roots and using a leaf to drop it in to inflamed or weak eyes, presumably because of the resemblance of the flower to an eye. \u00e1hw-kt usd\u00ed-ga - 'deer eye, small' - Rudbeckia hirta L. - black-eyed Susan It is unclear why this is called the 'small' \u00e1hw-kt, as R. hirta is about the same size as the other brown centered s pecies. Mooney said nothing else about this species, but it may have been a suitable substitute for the R. fulgida as it is the most common species in the region. \u00e1hw-kt \u00fatana - 'deer eye, large' did not identify the 'large' species in this series. It may have been Rudbeckia triloba L., the only other common brown centered Rudbeckia in the region, but this is speculation on my part. As stated above, the species of Rudbeckia might have been interchangeable. \u00e1hw ganka - name \u00e1hw ganka is due to the shape and texture of the leaves, \u00e1hw glossing as 'deer' and ganka as 'tongue'. The same name was used for a species of Plantanthera (see askwaneta below). The leaves were eaten in the early spring after being parboiled and topped with bacon grease, (Perry 1974: 54). 198 \u00e1hw-g\u00fbl - 'deer ear' - from \u00e1hw ('deer') and g\u00fbl ('ear'), an apt description of the elliptic shape of the leaves. The leaves also have a red coloration near the most prominent veins, suggesting t he veins in the ear of an animal. Mooney also collected the that H. venosum was part of the formula for the ethnomedical condition known as uneg\u00f6 unanugots e\u00e7a ('it is coming out white') and a warm infusion of the leaves was dropped into sore eyes. Mi xed with other unidentified plants, the roots were used for diarrhea. Banks also found that the roots, combined with the roots of Mitchella repens L., were used for bowel complaints. alts\u00e1st usd\u00ed-ga 'a wreath for the caroliniana Walter - wood vetch Mooney did not explain the etymology of alts\u00e1st, so I assume that the wreath had a ceremonial purpose or may have been used to acquire a medicinal effect through contact with the skin. According to Mooney (1891: 325), this was one of the most valued herbs of the Cherokee. He found it used fo r a wide range of applications including as a decoction for indigestion, back pain, and stomach cramps. It was used after scratching to make the muscles of ball players tough and for the condition known as \u00fbnag\u00e9 ('black', see \u00fbnag\u00e9 k\u00fblakw\u00e9gtiy\u00fast unastets in intermediate categories). It could also be combined in a decoction with Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium for rheumatism. Olbrechts elaborated on this use under the condition known as dikanugosti nug\u00f6tl\u00f6 199 g\u00f6toti ('to be used with a briar to cause it to come out') and in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 207). Olbrechts found V. caroliniana used for several other conditions including the scrofulous the emetic formula for inad\u00f6 danskits\u00f6i ('when they dream of snakes'), a condition t hat often resulted in spoiled saliva (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 198). Banks (1953: 74) added that the stem of V. caroliniana and the needles of Pinus virginiana were placed in apple juice and drunk by ball players to increase stamina. alts\u00e1st \u00fatana - 'a wreath for the head, L. milk vetch or Coronilla varia L. - crown vetch This is the 'large' variety of alts\u00e1st, and both species here tend to be more robust than alts\u00e1st usd\u00ed-ga it referred to C. varia . However, C. varia is an introduced species and without knowledge of the time of its introduction to the region or a voucher specimen, it is difficult to discern if this is the species Olbrechts encountered or if he misidentified the botanical species. T he two are very different in habit and flower color. Mooney also collected the synonym distaiy\u00fast ('like dista\u00edy'), to Tephrosia virginiana (see dista\u00edy below). These two also shared a common use, the bruised leaves being combined and made into a decoction which was used as a wash to toughen the limb s of ball players. Olbrechts found that 200 alts\u00e1st \u00fatana was prepared and used in much the same manner as alts\u00e1st usd\u00ed-ga and was often used with it. amdit\u00e1t usd\u00edga - 'thing to drink water with, small' - Eupatorium purpureum L. - Joe- Pye-weed, gravel weed The generic term amdit\u00e1t stems from m ('water') and dit\u00e1t the hollo w stalk was used like a straw to suck up water instead of using a dipper. This was the 'small' species as opposed to E. maculatum , the large species (see below). Olbrechts recorded two for E. purpureum , amdit\u00e1t usdi g\u00fbtl\u00fbt h ('thing and amdit\u00e1t usd\u00edga gigage u y\u00f6ducwita ('thing to drink water with, small, red stem'). Another unidentified plant was simply called gigage u y\u00f6ducwita ('red stem') and could very well be E. purpureum due to the reddish-purple color of the stems and the uses discussed below. Mooney found that an infusion of E. purpureum combined with E. maculatum , made by pouring hot water over the pounded roots, was used for kidney problems and difficult urination. Olbrechts also found it was used for conditions of gigage and g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they are eaten by them'). These tw o conditions, blood in the urine and lower back pain, are typical symptoms of ki dney stones. This would suggest that gigage 201 uy\u00f6ducwita is E. purpureum , the common name \"gravel weed\" indicating its efficacy as a remedy for eliminating the painful stones. Olbrechts also found that E. purpureum was used as one of the components in formulas to stimulate love attraction. The stalk of E. purpureum was a medical implement used to blow medicine into the throat to treat the condition known as aniy\u00f6tseni ada n\u00f6woti ('to cure their throat') (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 261). Banks (1953: 129) found that a tea of t he root, alone or combined with the roots of Vernonia noveboracensis (L.) Michaux, was drunk for kidney problems and used by itself for women's health issues such as menstrual irregularities and to strengthen women during pregnancy. amdit\u00e1t \u00fatana - 'thing to drink water L. or Eupatorium fistulosum Barratt - This species was identified from Mooney 's collections. Olbrechts recorded the Cherokee name, but did not collect a sample. Mooney collected E. maculatum , but it is so similar to E. fistulosum , I am assuming that the species are interchangeable. Also, one of the differentiating characteristics between E. maculatum and E. fistulosum is the latter's hollow stem, a feature that is necessa ry to draw liquid through it. Both are also extremely large, reaching heights of up to 2. 5 meters and justifying the specific qualifier \u00fatana . The use as a kidney medicine recorded by Mooney was discussed in the previous section. Olbrechts identified bot h the large and small Cherokee species as E. purpureum , but treated them as different species in his notes, stating that the 'large' 202 species was also used for un\u00f6di tsandik u\u00e7a ('they urinate all milk') as well as patient's who were feverish and thirsty. \u00e1na - 'strawberry' - Fragaria virginiana Duchesne The name \u00e1na is a proper, opaque name for the delicious and nutritious wild strawberry. These were considered superior to the \"tame\" strawberries (Perry 1974: 56) and, as one of the first available fruits in spring, were a welcomed addition to corn bread. Mooney also stressed their importanc e in maintaining marital harmony in Cherokee households through the myth of t he origin of strawberries (Mooney 1900: 259). aniy\u00fast - 'like strawberry' - Potentilla canadensis five aniy\u00fast stems from \u00e1na ('strawberry') and -iy\u00fast ('like'), referring to the resemblance of the plant to the wild strawberry. Mooney found it was used in combination with Tephrosia virginiana and Heuchera americana , the roots of all three alternately boiled and cooled for four consec utive days until it became a thick syrup. This was drunk on the fourth day as a morn ing emetic to treat the dry cough associated with tuberculosis. The roots were dried for future use. Olbrechts found that a cold infusion of P. canadensis , used in conjunction with Rhododendron maximum L. and Kalmia latifolia L., was rubbed on ball players on their way to the ball field to ward off the medici ne of the other team's medicine man. Banks (1953: 62) found similar uses, finding that bal l players would chew the root the night before the game to improve thei r stamina and would eat the root or bath in a tea of the 203 root to prevent injury. He also found that a tea of the pounded roots was drunk to cure thrush. Witthoft (1947) reported that the r oot was once used by the Cherokee to treat fevers. anaskwal\u00f6ski - 'they the name anaskwal\u00f6ski ('they cut themselves') is especially in reference to long objects and the name refers to the brittle roots. He also found that the pounded roots were placed on the scratched forehead of a patient to treat a headache and a tea of the steeped roots was drunk for a cough remedy. Banks (1953: 55) also recorded the same uses as Olbrecht s, along with drinking the root tea for sore throats and eating the greens in the early spring. The roots were considered to be strong and have an inherent peppery heat. and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk - 'it takes things from around the teeth and tongue' - Geranium maculatum L. - wild geranium or Heuchera americana L. - alumroot The name and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk was one of the few examples of Cherokee names representing utilitarian functions. It originat ed from the application of these plants to treat conditions like thrush and scurvy and stems from tstl\u00e2sk\u00fb or tstl\u00e2sk ('the fire, or light, has gone out'), a form of ktl\u00e2sk\u00fb ('the fire is going out'). The name symbolized the alleviation of pain from the mout h and gums. Mooney referred to both G. maculatum and H. americana as simply and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk , while Olbrechts differentiated them into two species, and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk usd\u00ed-ga and and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk respectively. ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk ganul\u00fbh ('it peels them off, herbaceous') for H. americana. The name refers to the tendency for the bark to easily peel off and distinguishes it as a non-woody species (see the chapter on shrubs for a discussion of ditan\u00e9law\u00e1sk ). Mooney found that the chewed root of G. maculatum was blown into the mouth of a child suffering from thrush (1891: 326). Olbr echts found a similar application, but in his version the roots were steeped and blown in to the mouth through a tube. This was repeated four times while the patient faced eas t. He also found that it was used for the conditions unisikwask\u00f6 ('when they are coughing') and that either species of and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk were used for unitadesgisk\u00f6 ('thirsty'). According to Olbrechts, H. americana was used in obstinate cases of thrush when G. maculatum failed to alleviate the condition. Mooney recorded a similar application for a case of thrush with sores in the throat known as unitstl\u00e2sk\u00fb. The roots of H. americana , combined with either Tephrosia virginiana or a combination of Potentilla canadensis and a species of \u00fanistil\u00fbist, were boiled in two separate containers, one decoction made stronger than the other one. The weaker portion was drunk to vomit, and then the stronger one was drunk throughout the day. This was done for four days with meals taken after vomiting. No salt, hot food, or vegetables that ooze water after picking were taken while under treatment. A tea of the bark was also used to stop vomiting. The plant was dried for future use. Banks had nothing to add for G. maculatum , but found several more uses for H. americana . A tea of the roots was drunk for dysentery and rumbling in the bowels and the chewed root would remove a coat ing on the tongue. Finely pounded roots were 205 soaked in cold water for several hours and the resulting infusion was used for thrush. Sores that appeared in late summer were cured with a tea of H. americana . The tea was sprinkled on the sore and the scab would fall off revealing new, healthy skin. and\u00f6lad\u00f6 - no gloss - Asclepias syriaca L. - common milkweed Olbrechts recorded this name, but did not provide a gloss. He found that bowstrings were once made from the stem fiber s, but that medicinal applications were forgotten. anisg\u00edna-(ts)un\u00e2 ns\u00fbta - 'ghosts' terrapin rattles' - Dioscorea villosa wild yam The name stems from anisg\u00edna ('ghosts'), the plural form of asgina ('a ghost'), and tsun\u00e1s\u00fbta, the name of the rattles worn on the ankles of by women in the ceremonial dances. The dried seedpods of D. villosa made a noise that was reminiscent of the sound made by the pebbles in the tortoi se shell rattles. Olbrechts also gitsitsi ('fowl's breast bone'), the latter due to the resemblance of the dried capsule to the breastbone of a large bird. Mooney found that a decoction of the r oots was used as an emetic to remove saliva that had been spoiled by ghosts. It was used in a similar fashion for dreams about snakes or when snake poison was put in food, both of which caused spoiled the saliva. The plant was not dried and stored, but could be found in winter by the dried tops (Ms. 1894). Olbrechts found it was used in formulas for such conditions as g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they are eaten by them') and unawasti ('he gets cold' or 'that which chills one'). 206 It was also used for the condition with the colorful name, \"when a person's guts have come alive.\" This was not a form of diarrhea, but another form of gastric distress typified by bloat from overeating. The patient drank a decoction of Walter - buttonweed The folk genus is the plural form of awan\u00edsk ('he talks'). Mooney said that both these plants were, \"given to ch ildren as a charm to make them eloquent speakers.\" Mooney also recorded t hat there was a large variety, aniwanisk \u00fatana , but he did not provide the botanical species. He found that L. virginicus was used for snakebite and Banks added that the plant was boiled in milk for five minutes and given to a dog that had been bitten by a snake (1953: 110). aniwanisk g\u00fbtl\u00fbth - 'talkers or they talk, dwelling on the hillside' - Acalypha virginica L. - three-seeded mercury The specific g\u00fbtl\u00fbth from g\u00fbtl\u00fbta ('hillside') combined with h ('living' or 'dwelling'). No further informat ion was available about the medicinal qualities of this species. 207 \u00e2sig\u00fbniski - 'it covers it' - Polygonum scandens L. - climbing buckwheat The name ('it it') stems cover it' 'I roof it'). Mooney did not explain the name; however this is a climbing vine that can cover a large area. Mooney also collected the names uwed\u00e2ita ('it is going about') or uned\u00e2ita ('they are going about') for a plant he identified simply as wild buckwheat. But he did say that the plant \"sends out runners like the strawberry\", so he may have been referring to P. scandens . A decoction of P. scandens was used as a wash to make hair grow longer. askwaneta - 'it made curly' - Plantanthera spp hellebore Mooney recorded this name, but Olbrec hts provided the gloss, applying to the second species, Veratrum viride . Olbrechts attributed the name to a part of the plant that was curly, and Mooney wrote that this plant did have a \"mass of cord-like roots.\" This species of Plantanthera was one of the purple varieties that flowers in late summer. Mooney also collected the name \u00e1hw ganka ('deer tongue') for the genus Plantanthera , presumably describing the shape of the leaves. The only medicinal applications were attributed to the orange-flowered species, Plantanthera ciliaris (L.) Lindl., in Banks (1953: 23). A cold infusion of the rhizome was used for headaches and a warm infusion for dysentery. A piece of the r oot was also used to stimulate fish to bite the hook. Olbrechts collected the names askwaneta and dusuga askwaneta ('they . Dusuga ('they are claws') is a folk generic usually reserved for plants associated with the scratching ritual, and V. viride was used in 208 conditions that required scratching. Scratc hing was often done to treat such conditions as rheumatism, listlessness, and preparing for the ball game. Veratrum viride was considered a harsh remedy and could only be used externally (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 204). Olbrechts specifically mentioned it for conditions that required scratching such as unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i (when they have pains all over their body'), usonuli unt ane\u00f6 ('sudden attack'), and for muscle cramps. For muscle cramps, the roots were steeped in water and sprinkled on the scratched area. ast or \u00fbst - 'string' or 'thread' - Amphicarpa bracteata (L.) Fernald hog peanut The name ast ('string' or 'thread' ) was most li kely due to the thin, twining vines produced by A. bracteata . Olbrechts found that it was used for snakebite, a tea of the plant steeped and blown around the bite in a clo ckwise direction. Banks also found that it was useful for snakebite, identifying the r oot as the medicinal part of the plant. The root was brewed into a tea and blown on the bite while reciting a prayer. He also found that a tea of the roots was used for diarrhea (1953: 67-68). at un\u00e9ga adsil\u00fbsk from at ('wood'), un\u00e9ga ('white'), and adsil\u00fbsk ('flower'), due to its woody stem and white flowers. Mooney also recorded the synonym tig\u00fbnah\u00edta tsuskwal\u00e1ga ('long prongs of plural of plural of uskw\u00e1laga or incipient antler of the ('groundhog's tuksi mooyi and tuksi usu ga, for which he did 209 not provide a gloss. But Mooney recorded an unidentified as t\u00fbks t\u00fbks uw\u00e1y ('terrapin's hand or a reference to the shape of the leaves. Mooney found that E. repens was used with another unidentified evergreen species for gonorrhea (Ms. 1894). Olbrechts published two uses for E. repens , for anatoy\u00e7i ustiga ('if the children and aninedzi ada ('their breast, to cure anyone with, terrapin does it to them, as they go about') ( 1932: 251). Banks (1953: 98) added other uses including a root tea drunk for kidney trouble and combined with Gaultheria procumbens L. for chronic indigestion. For chest ailments, a tea of the leaves and roots is used in the summer month, just the roots in the winter. \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl - 'it climbs the mountain' - Panax quinquefolium L. - ginseng or Panax trifolium L. - dwarf ginseng The name \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl was a composite of the words \u00e2tal ('a high mountain') and or tsl ('I am climbing'). There is some confusion concerning the botanical species associated with \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl. Mooney makes no mention of P. trifolium in his published materials or his notes, while Olbrechts only refers to it and never to P. quinquefolium . However, Olbrechts does refer to a small variety of known as \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl tsunsti ('it climbs the mountain, small') and he recorded special uses for this kind of \u00e2 tal-g\u00fbl. Panax trifolium is much smaller and more gracile than P. quinquefolium , and it is quite likely that he misidentif ied the larger species. He claimed in his notes that the small kind was not a different species, but Banks (1953: 93) found 210 that the uses and names for the two species we re the same, with the exception of a few informants who identified a large and small kind. At this time, P. trifolium is quite rare in the North Carolina mountains (Radford et al. 1968:760), but it is not known how prevalent it was in the late 19th and early 20th century. It is unlikely that it was over- harvested like its more robust cousin, P. quinquefolium , as the ginseng traders were not interested in the small, round roots of P. trifolium (Harding 1972: 53). I believe it is safe to assume that it was never as common to the region as the larger species and not as well known as a distinct species to many Cherokee. For the purposes of this work, I will treat Olbrechts' record of use for \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl to mean P. quinquefolium and for \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl tsunsti to mean P. trifolium . Timberlake may have been the first to mention a medicinal application by the Cherokee for ginseng, stating that it, \"never fails curing the most inveterate venereal disease, which, however, they never had o ccasion for, for that distemper, before the arrival of the Europeans among them (Willi ams 1927: 71).\" According to Mooney, the dried root of P. quinquefolium , which he claimed was bitter like licorice, was beaten into a powder and an infusion was made by pouring hot water over the pulverized root. This was used for headaches, cramps, and female troubles as well as by conjurers for unspecified diseases. In his published materials he also added that the chewed root was blown on the area when pain was present in the patient's side (Mooney 1891: 326). The root was gathered in the fall and sold to white traders, increasing its value to the Cherokee as it was one of the few sources of income in the region. Olbrechts made the following observation about ginseng: 211 This is one of the most important pl ants in the Cherokee medical botany. It is not only used in curing but also plays a part in love medicine. There is no other plant that is treated with so much respect by the laity as well as by the medicine men. When collecting the root s, the medicine man would often recite a prayer to Unetan\u00f6i ('Great Man' or 'The Apportioner '), in which permission was humbly begged to gather the plant. Olbrechts claimed that ginseng, along with Nicotiana rustic a and some of the birthing plants were the only ones dried by the Cherokee for future use (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 91). However, it is obvious from Mooney's notes that this was not an accurate observation and that many species were dried for future use or were recognized by the dried tops for collection when not in season. Olbrechts recorded several applications for P. quinquefolium , including for such conditions as aninedzi dig\u00f6walos\u00f6\u00e7i yune istane\u00e7a ('to cure anyone with tsunineli\u00e7q ('disgusted by the sight of a corpse'). It was used alone or with Aristolochia serpentaria for aniskina uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i ('ghosts have changed dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'), unawasti egwa ('big chill'), and a condition simply to as \"heat\". The small variety, P. trifolium , was specifically noted for use against the condition g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they are eaten by them') and to prevent attacks by witches. It was used as a love medicine and to \"gain the goodwill with whoever one comes in contact with.\" 212 Banks found that ginseng was used for \"bold hives\", a rash that babies develop soon after birth. If the rash did not develop, it was believed that the baby might die (Cavender 1996). The root could be chewed or sometimes made into a tea for pain in the side, colic, and shortness of breath or coughing. A cold infusion of the pounded roots of ginseng and Erythronium americanum was given to a person who was feeling faint. The pounded roots also made a good poultice for bringing boils to a head. at\u00e1ts\u00fb - 'trout' - Oenothera fruticosa L. - sundrops Mooney provided no other informati on than the botanical and Cherokee names for O. fruticosa . Olbrechts glossed at\u00e1ts\u00fb as 'like at\u00e1ts\u00fb' - Oenothera biennis L. - evening primrose The name at\u00e1ts\u00fb-iy\u00fast has to do with the resemblance of O. biennis to O. fruticosa . The latter is the native species and would be considered the original while the former was introduced from Europe and woul d be 'like' the original. Mooney also recorded the name skw un\u00edgist ('hog food'), a name applied to several edible species that were enjoyed by or fed to the hogs. The name stems from skw ('hog') and un\u00edgist, the plural of ag\u00edst ('food'). Olbrechts found that O. biennis had several medicinal applications. It was used for kidney problems and the pounded roots were steeped in water and used to relive the pain of hemorrhoids. It was used for stomachaches and with a species of Rosa for unisikwask\u00f6 ('when they are coughing'). Witthoft found that the leaves of O. biennis 213 were parboiled and cooked in grease and that the juice extracted from the roots was used as a poultice on hemorrhoids. at\u00e1ts\u00fb amayutehi - 'trout, water edge growing' - Erythronium americanum Ker - trout lily The Cherokee name and the common name for E. americanum are both indicative of the resemblance or its mottl ed leaves to a trout, with the Cherokee name indicating the plants favored location in rich soil along mountain streams. Olbrechts also was provided with a specimen of Thalictrum dioicum L. as an example of at\u00e1ts\u00fb amayutehi, which may have been due to the resemblance of the leaves to fish scales, but this species will be dealt with under another heading (see ay\u00fbtaw\u00edgi below). Medicinal applications were attributed to Banks, who found that a tea of the root tea was used to break a fever. The roots were also combined with those of Panax trifolium , pounded together, and made into a cold infusion that was given to a person who was feeling feint. The warm juice of t he leaves, heated over a fire, was extracted and placed on a slow healing wound. The plant was also an ecological indicator of fishing season, the bloom of the plant signifyi ng that it was time to start fishing. Spit from the chewed root was believed to enhanc e the fisherman's chance of catching a fish (1953: a combination of t ('wood') and iy\u00fast ('like'), was due to the woody stalk. No medicinal applications were attributed to S. pilosum . atsils\u00fbt - 'fire, to Erigeron annuus (L.) Persoon daisy fleabane ats\u00edla ('fire') and s\u00fbt ('to make with'). Olbrechts best explained the reason for this name: (It) was never extensively used in medicine proper, but was important in ceremonies because it was used by the Cherokees to make fire: the stalk was dried and pulverized, and then the powder was used in drilling fire. Its general use has become extinct in everyday life many generations ago, but it continued to be used to kindle the ceremonial fires.\" Two botanical species are named above due to a discrepancy in identification between Mooney and Olbrechts. Mooney said that atsils\u00fbt, the name in the Middle Cherokee dialect, was E. canadensis . He recorded a shortened version of it, tsils\u00fbt, and a version in the Upper Cherokee dialect, atsils\u00fbt\u00fb, as well as the synonym iy\u00e1g\u00fb or iy\u00e1g (no gloss) . Olbrechts identified the botanical species as E. annuus , and in addition to atsils\u00fbt, recorded the synonyms tsisoti usd\u00edga (no gloss) and tcisti (no gloss). 215 Although he said that it had little medicinal use, Olbrechts did record that the leaves of E. annuus were taken out of an infusion and held against the jaw in case of a toothache. He also found it was used with an unidentified species of fern for rheumatism. Mooney also found that the leaves if E. canadensis were used for toothache, but he did not explain the procedure. ats\u00fbk ganul\u00fbh - 'smelling wood, herbaceous' wintergreen, teaberry The name ats\u00fbk is the same as the folk genus for the birches, stemming from t or 'wood' and s\u00fbk' or 'smelling' due to the fragrance of the essential oils. The qualifier ganul\u00fbh designates that as the 'herbaceous' kind of ats\u00fbk. Mooney said that this plant had a smell like birches, grew under pines, was a woody creeper with red berries, and was used by manufacturers to flavor candy. He did not attribute any medicinal applications for G. procumbens to the Cherokee, but Banks found that the roots of it and Epigaea repens were used for chronic indigestion and the leaves were chewed like tobacco (1953: 98). at\u00fbka - 'it unravels' - Chenopodium album L. - lamb's-quarters Mooney did not explain the etymology of at\u00fbka , and though I am familiar with the plant, I can not speculate on the reason for this name. In his notes, Mooney recorded that C. album was as an edible green, but he also found that ball players were encouraged to avoid eating this plant becaus e the stalk was easily broken and they would not want to become fragile through consumption of the plant (Mooney 1890a). 216 daisy name is from the name for lamb's-quarters, at\u00fbka ('it unravels'), and the suffix - iy\u00fast ('like') due to the resemblance of the plant to Chenopodium album . No other information is available on the Cherokee relationship to this plant. ay\u00f6da gwalogi - 'it thunders (habitually)' - Trillium grandiflorum (Michaux) Salisbury - large flowered trillium This name and gloss came from Olbrecht s who did not provide an explanation for the gloss. Banks collected several names, wh ich he claimed were collective names for all the trilliums, the most common of which was ayadigwalosk\u00ed . All of them he glossed as 'thunder and lightening' in reference to the mythical little red men whose conversations from the Darkening land caus e the rumble of thunder from the west (Mooney 1900: 248). Mooney collected the name nig\u00fbtagualaski for a plant he questioningly identified as Trillium grandiflorum and the similar name andag\u00fbntagwalaski for Trillium cernuum L., again with a question mark (Ms. 2235). In his notes he included the name unig\u00fbntagwali\u00e1sk , which he glossed as 'they butt the ground', but he was unable to identify the plant. He did record that there were two varieties differentiated by leaf color, one with dirty brown leaves and the other with spotted leaves. He did say that the plant grew in rich coves, came up in March, and had red flowers, all characteristics of the red- flowered trilliums, including T. cernuum . Banks and Olbrechts both claimed that the Cherokee did not use trilliums for medicine. Olbrechts said that the uses had been forgotten, but T. grandiflorum was 217 collected and sold to the herb traders. But M ooney found that the roots of both varieties of unig\u00fbntagwali\u00e1sk were steeped in cold water and drunk for four days for a condition known as gakt\u00fbta . The main symptom of this condition was the spitting of blood, so the symbolism inherent in the red-flowered species of Trillium may have indicated that they were preferred remedies. ay\u00fbtaw\u00edgi - 'it bursts' - Thalictrum dioicum L. - early meadow rue The name ay\u00fbtaw\u00edgi is due to the tendency of the hollow stalk to burst under pressure. This may have been the 'small' ( usd\u00ed-ga ) species, as the following recorded the synonym dal\u00e2ni \u00fbts\u00fbtuwadsiska ('yellow fish scales'), due to the resemblance of the leaves to fish scales, and Olbrechts recorded it as at\u00e1ts\u00fb amayutehi ('trout, water edge growing'), possibly for the same reason. Olbrechts also said that it was once used for medicine, but the use was forgotten. Banks (1953: 47) found that a tea of the roots was used for diarrhea. ay\u00fbtaw\u00edgi \u00fatana - 'it bursts, large' - Thalictrum pubescens Pursh. - tall meadow rue This is the large folk species of ay\u00fbtaw\u00edgi . No other information is available concerning T. pubescens dan\u00faga - tearthumb Mooney gave four meanings for dan\u00faga : 1) as the fork generic for P. sagittatum , because of its rasping stalks, 2) a profe ssional scratcher used to scratch the ball players, 3) a large yellow grasshopper with roughly serrated legs, and 4) a garfish with a 218 long snout and small, serrated teeth. He also recorded the synonym dit\u00e1wask ('it causes festering'), from gaw\u00e1sk\u00fb ('it is festering'), but he did not explain the etymology of this name. Olbrechts recorded P. sagittatum as dan\u00faga gan\u00f6sge ('grasshopper, his leg'), due to the appearance and texture of the stem. Mooney wrote that a cold decoction of the pounded, upper portion of the plant was used for colic. The patient was scratc hed over the most painful areas and the decoction was rubbed on the scratched area. Olbrechts found P. sagittatum was used for the scrofulous condition duletsi ('kernels') and as a love attractant. The barbs along the stem were symbolic of grasping the att ention of the object of ones affection. dayew\u00fb - 'it sews itself up' - Cacalia atriplicifolia L. - pale Indian-plantain Mooney wrote that the name stemmed from the observation that, \"when the leaves are torn they grow together again where injured.\" He also recorded it as dayew\u00fb egwa ('it sews itself up, large') to dist inguish it from the 'small' species (see dayew\u00fb usd\u00edga below). Mooney said the following of C. atriplicifolia , Held in great repute as a poultice for cuts, bruises, and cancer, to draw out blood or poisonous matter. The bruised leaf is bound over the spot and frequently removed. The dry powdered leaf wa s formerly sprinkled over like salt (1891: 326). 219 In his notes he added that a warm decoction of the pounded roots of dayew\u00fb, combined with those of Ceanothus americana L., Polymnia uvedalia L., and Cimicifuga racemosa L., was used for fevers. Olbrechts found three applications for C. atriplicifolia ; a warm infusion of the roots was applied to inflamed wounds, a warm infusion was drunk by a woman immediately after giving birth, and the hollow stalks were used to blow medicine on a patient. dayew\u00fb usd\u00edga - 'it sews itself up, small' - Prenanthes alba L. - white lettuce The name dayew\u00fb usd\u00edga is a synonym for this species, which is included here as a counterpart to the previously discussed 'large species'. Its medicinal qualities will be discussed under the heading tsug\u00e2sk \u00fatana below. d\u00e2y uw\u00e2y - 'beaver's paw' - no botanical identification The name d\u00e2y uw\u00e2y is a composite of d\u00e2y ('beaver') and uw\u00e2y ('paw'), but Mooney gave no further information about t he etymology of the name. It was included as part of a formula for the rheumatic condition known as did\u00f6lesgi ('the crippler' or 'when it breaks them') (Mooney 1891: 350). As all the other components of this formula are ferns, this may be Lygodium palmatum (Bernh.) Swartz, the American climbing fern, which has a leaf resembling the fingers of a hand that could be said to resemble the paws of a beaver. However, this is purely speculation on my part. 220 did\u00e1wahist\u00edsk - 'it makes fetid sores' - Solanum carolinense L. - horse nettle The wound from scratches caused by the sharp prickles of S. carolinense tends to become infected, hence the name did\u00e1wahist\u00edsk . Banks provided the only Cherokee medicinal applications for S. carolinense , finding that the berries, fried in grease, were used to cure dogs with mange and a necklace made from pieces of the root were placed around a baby's neck to check excessive saliva flow (1953: 115). The Creek used the roots in the same way to ease the pai n from teething, the most likely cause for excessive saliva flow with infants (Alexander and Paredes 1998). dilaiy\u00fast - 'skunk-like' - Monarda clinopodia L. - basil balm Olbrechts did not provide a gloss for didlaiy\u00fast , but Alexander (1971: 146) recorded dila as the Cherokee name for skunk. The addition of the suffix - iy\u00fast ('like) indicates that the plant was known for its strong odor which resembles the skunk's best defense. It was combined with Solidago caesia L. for the condition known as gig\u00f6 yandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood'). dig\u00e1yas\u00fb k - 'it Collinsonia canadensis L. - stone root, horse balm Mooney claimed the source of dig\u00e1yas\u00fb k was as\u00fbg\u00fb ('it smells') and dig\u00e1sk\u00e9n, the plural form of g\u00e1sk\u00e9n ('his arm pit'). Olbrecht s provided a similar gloss for dig\u00e1yas\u00fb k, changing it to 'his armpits smell'. Mooney claimed that this was due to the bad odor of the plant. I propose that both of these may have been a misinterpretation of the Cherokee intent. The leaves and flowers of C. canadensis have 221 a lemony smell, which is not at all offensiv e, and this was also the portion that was used as a deodorant for smelly armpits (Banks 1953: 108). If the Cherokee perceived this plant as smelli ng bad, it is highly unlikely they would use it to remedy a bad odor. Therefore, I concl ude that the name is due to the application of the plant and not its organoleptic qualities. Olbrechts also collected it as dig\u00e1yas\u00fb k gatush ('his armpits smell, mountain dwelling'). Mooney found that a tea of the root of C. canadensis , combined with either the root or top of Carduus altissimum or the roots of Smilax herbacea , was taken for bloat from overeating. The chopped root, used alone, was also made into a decoction and used for diarrhea. The roots could be gather ed through the winter as needed. Olbrechts found it was a component in the formula for - Trichostema dichotomum L. - blue curls Trichostema already been discussed as g\u00e1w's\u00fbk usd\u00edga ('smeller, small'), but was included here as a species of dig\u00e1yas\u00fb k. The blue flowers are the source of the specific qualifier. dik\u00e9wusk - 'it is going blind' - Ipomoea coccinea L. - red morning glory Mooney found two glosses for dik\u00e9wusk , 'it is going blind' and 'it has sore eyes'. Mooney may have misidentified the botanical s pecies here as he stated that this was known as wild potato and that it was, \"lik e morning glory with a tuber.\" This sounds 222 more like Ipomoea pandurata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, commonly known as \"man-root\". Ipomoea coccinea is an introduced annual and does not have a tuberous root. Mooney claimed that one of his informants said that there were two varieties of dik\u00e9wusk , the large ( \u00fatana ) species and the small ( usd\u00edga ) species, but these were not identified. Mooney recorded that a tea of the roots wa s used for \"spinal fever\" (meningitis?), the tea drunk at intervals for four days while av oiding salt for seven days. It was reported to be a good remedy. dilastag\u00edst egwa - 'it is tramped upon (constantly), virginica (L.) Pennell - false foxglove Dilastag\u00edst was the form from the Middle Cher okee dialect, that from the Upper dialect being dilast\u00e9st. It stems from g\u00fblast\u00fbg\u00fb ('I am tramping upon it'). I will use the Middle dialect form for the remainder of this section as it was the only one extant at the time of Olbrechts' research and he recorded all his species as kinds of dilastag\u00edst . Mooney did not know the rationale behind the name, but my observations of the genus Aureolaria is that they often fall over at t he fruiting stage, suggesting a plant that has been \"tramped upon\". All members of dilastag\u00edst are also members of the botanical genus Aureolaria. Aureolaria virginica was considered the 'large' kind, but the botanical accounts on maximum heights do not agree with this assessment (Radford et al. 1968: 956-958). The medicinal qualities for the dilastag\u00edst were exclusively recorded by Olbrechts, who found that all species of dilastag\u00edst were used for a condition known as \"this is to treat (them) with if the racc oon has made them to be ill\". The symptoms for 223 this condition included fainting and gasping for breath, much like the sound made by a cornered raccoon. The roots of the differ ent species were combined and made into an infusion or a decoction. The patient drank this for four consecutive mornings while abstaining from food. Applicati ons attributed specifically to A. virginicus included unakewag\u00f6i upon (L.) Farwell - foxglove and laevigata (Raf.) Raf. Both A. flava and A. laevigata were identified as the 'small' kinds of dilastag\u00edst , but A. flava tends to be the largest species in the region, so this may have been a case of misidentification (Radford et al. 1968: ('it is tramped upon (constantly), of which is not hollow') for A. flava . This would be significant in light of the following species, A. pedicularia , the hollow stalk of which was used as an implement to blow liquid medicines on a patient. Besides its combination with all kinds of dilastag\u00edst for the disease caused by raccoons mentioned above, A. flava was identified specifically for use to treat the conditions atawini ei ('the forest dwellers') is tramped upon small, soft' or dilastag\u00edst ugatsalagisti - 'it is tramped upon (constantly), it is sticky' - Aureolaria pedicularia (L.) Raf. - false foxglove The specific qualifier ugatsalagisti (\"it is sticky') is due to the sticky glandular hairs that characterize this particular s pecies (Smith 1998: 153). Field observation will be necessary to determine if it is typically 's mall' or 'soft', or at least smaller and softer than other kinds of dilastag\u00edst . Besides its combination with all kinds of dilastag\u00edst for the disease caused by raccoons mentioned above, A. pedicularia appears to be the most widely used of the dilastag\u00edst . It was used for the ethnomedical condition dawzni e i unit\u00f6y\u00f6 (no gloss), as well as for burns, profuse urination, to reli eve the thirst that accompanies fevers, and in combination with Eupatorium purpureum for uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white'). The hollow stalks were used to blow liquid medicine on a patient who had been wounded, bruised, or shot by a gun or a bow. It was combined with Silene antirrhina L. as a medicine to attract the attentions of a love interest. Both species have a sticky quality, so this was probably due to the belie f that the object of affection would be \"stuck\" on the user of this combination. dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk - 'they pull each & Weig.) Seimore -smooth yellow violet Dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk was the folk generic for several species of violet, stemming from ts\u00edswatesk\u00fb ('I am pulling his head off') and dastadaskwt sk\u00fb two are pulling each other's heads off'), but Mooney did not explain the reason for this name. It is most likely 225 due to the way the flower appears to dangle on the stalk. This is one of the yellow- flowered species, hence the specific qualifier dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk ('yellow-flowered'). Olbrechts claimed that violets were once used, but that the use was forgotten. But in his notes he states that several species, including V. pubescens var. leiocarpon , were used as part of the remedy for the type of cancerous sores known as adayeski ('eating itself'). This was the only application attributed to this species. dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk tsuligw\u00e1ntagal\u00fb ita - 'they pull each other's heads off, its leaves are split' - Viola pedata L. - bird-foot violet The specific leaves are stems from tsigw\u00e1nutagal\u00fb isk\u00fb ('I am splitting a leaf') and relates to the dissected leaves that resemble a bird's foot, hence the common name. No medicinal applications were attributed specifically to this species. dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk tsund\u00ed-ga - 'they pull each other's heads off, small' - marsh blue violet or Viola sororia Willd. - common blue violet The botanical species is unclear for dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk tsund\u00ed-ga . Mooney identified it as V. cucullata , but then described it as the common blue violet, which is V. sororia . It may be that the Cherokee did not differentia te between the two species as they are quite similar, but this is purely speculation on my part. The specific qualifier tsund\u00ed-ga is the plural form of other's being the plural of ukwal\u00e1ga ('leaf') and tigasakwal\u00fb the plural of gasakwal\u00fb ('circular' 226 or 'round'). There was also a white yellow flowered variety of dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk tsukwalaga purple-flowered'). Mooney found that a poultice of the pounded roots, leaves, or both was used as a poultice to draw a boil to a head. Olbrecht s claimed that violets were once used, but that the use was forgotten. But in his notes he states that several species, including V. sororia , were used as part of the remedy for the type of cancerous sores known as adayeski ('eating itself'). dind\u00e1skwat\u00e9sk unega adsil\u00fb white flowered' - Viola Aiton violet unega sk ('white-flowered') reflects the salient feature of V. striata and the source of its common name. This was the third species, along with V. sororia and Viola pubescens Ait. var. leiocarpon , that were specifically mentions as part of the remedy for adayeski ('eating itself'). diliw\u00e1tahesk - 'its ears R. Brown - wild indigo The generic name diliw\u00e1tahesk stems from g\u00fbl\u00e9n ('its ears') and tal\u00edwathesk ('it is shaking') due to the way the wind shak es the leaves. Mooney wrote that there was a similar term, aliwtaheh\u00fb (plural form: daliwtaheh\u00fb ) that glosses as 'the leaf or ear is shaking', but he did not indicate that it was a synonym for B. tinctoria . Mooney found that the pounded root was held against an aching tooth. Will West Long told Money that it would make the bad tooth fall out. Banks (1953: 68) found that a 227 cold tea was used to stop vomiting and that t he roots imparted a blue dye to fabrics, but Witthoft (n.d.: 67) claimed that no one actually still used the plant. dista\u00edy - '(they are) tough' - Tephrosia goat's rue Dista\u00edy stems from asta\u00edy ('it is strong, hard, or tough') and refers to the long, tough roots of T. virginiana . This perceived toughness is reflected in the primary uses for T. virginiana . The roots were made into a decoction in which women would wash their hair to make it strong and prevent it from falling out, and ball players would use a preparation of the leaves to make their limbs tougher (Mooney 1900: 425). In his notes, Mooney elaborated on this procedure to add t hat the ball players would use a cold infusion of the bruised leaves of T. virginiana combined with Astragalus canadensis , sometimes with the addition of the leaves of Leucothoe axillaris or other plants. He also added that the plant was used for a tired, l anguid feeling and that it was combined with Heuchera americana and Potentilla canadensis for the dry cough associated with tuberculosis (see aniy\u00fast above). Olbrechts recorded the synonym and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk asta\u00edy unastetsi ('it takes things from around the teeth and tongue, strong roots'), but clai med that his informants had forgotten the use of the plant. However, he did publish that a decoction of the roots was given to a child to make them, \"strong and muscular\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 128). Banks added that the roots were used wi th other ingredients for kidney troubles and that a tea of the roots, applied afte r scratching, was good for muscle cramps. 228 distaiy\u00fast - 'like dista\u00edy' - Astragalus canadensis L. This plant was named ('like dista\u00edy') for its resemblance to Tephrosia virginiana . been discussed above as alts\u00e1st \u00fatana . diysat\u00edsk usd\u00ed-ga - Campanula divericata Michaux - harebell Diysat\u00edsk was the Middle Cherokee dialect form, diyisat\u00edsk being the Upper Cherokee dialect form. Plants in this folk genus can also be called by the singular form, ayesat\u00edsk . It stems from yesat\u00fb ('dew'), because dew or rain is slow to evaporate from the leaves of these plants. Mooney found that a cold infusion of the beaten roots was used for diarrhea. Water was added to the infusion and drunk until t he root lost its strength. A decoction of the unbeaten roots was drunk hourly for bloody flux. This was repeated until relief was attained. For whooping cough, a decoction of the root was drunk at short intervals for four days. Salt was avoided during this treat ment. The root was not dried and stored for future use. diysat\u00edsk \u00fatana - 'it gets dew on it, large' - Scrophularia marilandica L. - figwort This is the 'large' kind of diysat\u00edsk, and S. marilandica can be up to 3 three times as tall as Campanula divericata . Mooney found that it was used in combination with or in the same manner as diysat\u00edsk usd\u00ed-ga specific epithet scrophulariaefolia explains the Cherokee perception that the foliage this plant was 'like' that of the previous species, Scrophularia to the resemblance of the inflorescence to the downy tail of t he mink. No further information was available for this species. dun\u00fan - 'tubers' or 'potatoes' - Liatris scariosa (L.) Willd. - blazing star The folk generic dun\u00fan is due to the globular tuberous dun\u00fan as 'potatoes', so I am assuming that this is a plural form. No furt her information was available concerning this species. dun\u00fan gatush - 'tubers, mountain dwelling' scaly blazing star Liatris squarrosa is not a common plant in the North Carolina mountains, but Mooney appears to have collected it and identifi ed it as a plant known to the Cherokee. His informant said that it was not eaten, but was used as medicine. He did not elaborate. Olbrechts recorded a folk species of dun\u00fan he identified as dun\u00fan g\u00fbtl\u00fbth ('tubers, dwelling on the hillside'), but he did not identify it to botanical species. It may well have been this species or another species of Liatris . He found that the tubers were pounded, either alone or with Apios americana and Antennaria solitaria , 230 and made into an infusion that was blown onto swollen testicles. The remnants of the tubers were later applied to the area as a poultice. dun\u00fan ig\u00e2tenh - 'swamp growing qualifier ig\u00e2tenh ('swamp growing') is quite appropriate as this is one of the few edible tubers that thrives in waterlogged soils (Blackmon and Reynolds 1986). Mooney wrote that the tubers were eat en in the spring when provisions were scarce. They were common along the creeks and the tubers could be found by locating the dead vines. The Cherokee prepared the tuber s by boiling them, some of them as large as potatoes. Mooney also called A. americana n\u00fan ig\u00e2tenh ('swamp growing tuber'). As mentioned above, Olbrechts found t hat this was one of the species used to treat swollen testicles. He also found that it was given to those who were suffering from having looked at a corpse or un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc e\u00e7a ('when their appetite gets spoiled'). gah\u00fbsk - 'it moves over, sitting' or 'it qui ts its sitting place and moves over' - Frasera carolinensis Walter - columbo The folk generic gah\u00fbsk stems from gah\u00fbn\u00fb ('he is moving over while sitting') due to the tendency of F. carolinensis to avoid growing in the same place for two consecutive years. This is an odd observation for a perennial species. No further information was available concerning this species. 231 gan\u00e9lta - 'pregnant' - Angelica venenosa (Greenway) Fernald - Zizia aurea (L.) W. J. Koch -golden alexander The folk generic gan\u00e9lta ('pregnant') is due to the swollen leaf nodes, a feature typical to the genus Angelica . Mooney also recorded A. venenosa as kanas\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like kanas\u00e2la'), referring to its resemblance to Cicuta maculata L. He found that a decoction of the roots was drunk and used to bathe a patient with a fever. Banks (1953: 93) referred to A. venenosa as \"water parsnip\", a common name usually reserved for Cicuta maculata . He recorded that an infusion of the leaves was used to wash the hands of someone that had handled the dead, which would suggest that it was C. maculata , a highly toxic plant often associated with death. However, he also said the plant was drunk by pregnant women, suggesting that in this instance he was referring to A. venenosa . Olbrechts identified gan\u00e9lta as Zizia aurea , commonly known as golden alexander, but this may have been a misidentif ication on his part and the young leaves are quite similar. He found that the root was used as a prophylactic against the negative consequences from coming into contact wi th a pregnant or menstruating woman, especially for aspiring medicine men (M ooney and Olbrechts 1932: 102). He elaborated on this in his notes: When a person is made ill by the l ook or presence of a pregnant or menstrual woman, or eating food prepared by such, the root is chewed and the juice rubbed all over, especially where the s oul is (heart). Others can do it if the patient is too ill. 232 gt\u00e2yt - 'it has gone round' - Polymnia uvedalia L. - leaf cup, bear's foot Mooney did not provide a gloss for gt\u00e2yt, but Olbrechts glossed it as 'it has gone round'. This was most likely due to t he bases of the opposite leaves meeting around the stem, hence the common name leaf c up. Olbrechts glossed this species as gt\u00e2yt usd\u00ed-ga ('it has gone round, small'), but this is highly unlikely as the species that it is paired with, Polymnia canadensis L. is generally much smaller (Radford et al. 1968: 1102). Olbrechts referred to P. canadensis by the folk generic gt\u00e2yt, but said its use had been forgotten. Mooney found that the pounded roots of gt\u00e2yt, combined with those of Ceanothus americana L., Cacalia atriplicifolia L., and Cimicifuga racemosa L., was used for Olbrechts found that was used with - 'it oozes' - Campanulastrum americanum (L.) Small - tall bellflower The generic name gaw\u00e2g stems from gaw\u00e2g\u00fb ('it is oozing'). Mooney wrote that this was said of thick liquids, but not wa ter. This is due to the milky latex that is apparent when the plant is injured. No medicinal qualities were attributed to C. americana , but Olbrechts did find that the young leaves were eaten as a vegetable. g\u00edgag\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk - 'red flower' - Spigelia marilandica L. - Indian pink The name g\u00edgag\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk is due to the red flowers that form at the top of this plant. Mooney wrote that the r oots, combined with those of Pilea pumila (L.) Gray or 233 another unidentified plant, were made into a decoction and drunk for treating intestinal worm. Olbrechts also found that S. marilandica was used as a worm remedy. A tea of it was mixed with honey and taken day and night for four days until the worm were expelled (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 214). Anot her formula consisted of a decoction of the roots of S. marilandica , combined with Cypripedium calceolus (L.) var . parviflorum and the bark of Aesculus octandra Marsh, take in the same manner as the previous formula. It was sweetened with honey or the pods of Gleditsia triacanthos (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 249). it' - Lysimachia quadrifolia L. - whorled loosestrife The name of the folk genus gigats\u00faya-h stems from g\u00edga ('blood') and truy\u00e1h, the 3 rd person form of d\u00e1giya\u00fb ('I have them in me'). Mooney pointed out that this is a plural form because the names of liquids ar e always in the plural form. He did not explain the reason for this name; however, t he flowers are yellow with a red center, suggesting that they appear to have bl ood in them. Olbrechts found that L. quadrifolia was used for three conditions associated with the urinary tract: uneg\u00f6 gigatsuy\u00e1 iy\u00fast - 'like no species identified The implication for gigatsuy\u00e1 iy\u00fast is that there was a plant in the Cherokee classification system that was known to resemble Lysimachia quadrifolia and was 234 named due to this resemblance. Although Mooney did not obtain a botanical identification for the plant, he did record t hat it was used for snakebites. The roots, combined with those of Scirpus validus Vahl., were pounded and made into a poultice for the bite and were made into a decoction to be drunk by the patient. He also pointed out the obvious in that the plant was not st ored for winter use, as there was no need for snakebite medicine in cold weather. g\u00edga tsanose \u00f6i - 'it is called blood' Torrey Olbrechts did g\u00edga tsanose \u00f6i, but g\u00edga ('blood') appears to stem from the maroon colo r of the mature flowers. The qualifier tsanose\u00f6i ('it is called ') appears in several of t he names collected by Olbrechts, but it is not clear if it is truly a part of a name, or just part of the response of the informant. The botanical species named here, Galium lanceolatum , may have been a misidentification as it is not common in the mountains of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 986). It would more than likely have been a similar, more common species of maroon-flowered Galium such as g\u00edl wta ('dog's penis') was due to the reddish color and tubular shape of the rhizome, reminiscent of the penis of a dog. Mooney found that the pounded root was used to relieve the pain fr om an aching tooth. Olbrechts found no medicinal uses, but said it was used as a dy e plant to impart a red dye to masks, bows, 235 baskets, ball sticks, etc. Witthoft claimed it was a favored dye of basket makers, imparting a, \"rich, fast color not matched by any other dyes (n.d.: 64).\" He also said that the roots were best when harvested in late summer, the plants having little dye value in early spring. Banks (1953: 54) added that the r oots soaked in cold water were used as a cough medicine and that the powdered dried root was used as a snuff for mucus congestion. gotadawina - no gloss - Castilleja coccinea (L.) Sprengel - Indian paint brush Olbrechts provided no gloss for gotadawina , and he also found that the plant was once used for medicine, but that the use had been forgotten. gug - 'chigger' or 'jigger' - The name gug ('chigger') is in reference to the tiny red mite that frequents fields throughout the Southeastern United Stat es and causes itching welts when it feeds on human hosts. The mite was thought to frequent the reddish-orange blossoms of A. tuberosa , which was often referred to by the common names chigger weed or jigger weed. Mooney also collected the synonym unisk\u00e1h ts\u00fantana ('it has heads, large'), having to do with the shape of the flower heads. This will be discussed under the folk generic unisk\u00e1h. Mooney found that A. tuberosa was used for flux, but he did not elaborate. Banks, however, found that a tea of the r oots was used for diarrhea and flux, and that the ideal time to harvest the root was when t he butterflies were visiting the flowers. The 236 butterflies needed to be the same reddish-orange color as the flowers. He also found that it was used for pleurisy, heart trouble, and fever (Banks 1953: 105). guh\u00ed - 'it stays green in the water' - Asclepias incarnata L. - swamp milkweed The folk generic guh\u00ed stems from guh\u00fb ('it is in the water or liquid') due to the habit of A. incarnata to grow in wet places. No fu rther information was available concerning this species. ig\u00fbliy\u00fast - 'fern-like' - Aureolaria pectinata (Nuttall) ig\u00fbl ('fern') and the suffix - iy\u00fast ('like'), due to the similar morphology of the leaf to that of a fern. The genus Aureolaria was discussed under the folk genus dilastag\u00edst , A. pectinata being the only species found in the mountains that was not discussed in that se ction. Two species actually have fern-like leaves, A. pectinata and A. pedicularia , and both tend to intergrade with each other. Matching the botanical species to the name ma y be more flexible here than is indicated by Mooney's identification. iyuga egwa - no gloss, 'large' - Ambrosia trifida L. - ragweed Mooney provided no gloss for the folk genus iyuga and the large variety is the only species he recorded, so it is not clear if there was a small variety and, if there was, if was a species of Ambrosia . The name for the smaller species of Ambrosia found in the mountains, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., was recorded by Olbrechts as uwagu staluyato ('the leaves have split themselves'), which was very different from iyuga . 237 Banks provided the only specific use for A. trifida as an ingredient in the medicine for the Green Corn Ceremony (1953: 155). Generic uses for species of Ambrosia included the leaf used as a tea for fever and the crushed leaf was rubbed on hives, infected toes, or poison ivy. \u00ednat\u00fb tsunigatogi tsanose\u00f6i - 'the (plant) which is called: snake's odor' - no species Olbrechts was not able to identify this species, but the distinctive name and the hope that someone may still know which plant has the odor of a snake warrants its inclusion. It was combined with a species of Salix and used for uyous\u00f6 tsunineli\u00e7q ('disgusted by the Prunella vulgaris L. - heal all or self heal The snake references in the two names recorded by Mooney are indicative of the resemblance of the seed heads to the erect tail of a rattlesnake. Olbrechts recorded it as g\u00e1tats\u00fal agisti ('it has dirt in it, to be eaten' - discussed above) due to the edibility of the leaves. Olbrechts claimed that P. vulgaris was just used for its edible greens and not for medicine, but Mooney, along with concurring on its edibility, recorded a medicinal use for it. For dreams of snakes or mud turtle s, the root was boiled and the decoction drunk as an emetic for four mornings while abstaini ng from salt. This clears the patient of too much saliva, possibly caused by conjurers, but he did not elaborate on this. The plant can be located in winter by the dried stalks or the few green leaves that survive in colder 238 weather (Ms. 1894). Banks found that a root tea was used to treat bruises and a cold water infusion to treat burns (1953: 112). kanas\u00e2la - 'water hemlock' - Cicuta maculata L. Kanas\u00e2la appears be an opaque, proper name for C. maculata . This plant is often identified as \"wild parsnip\", but it is always noted for being poisonous and the escaped cultivated parsnip is not toxic. Mooney said it was so poisonous that the smell was enough to produce dizziness, but that the Cherokee medicine men had a way to \"conjure\" the poison out of it. The primary applications for C. maculata were for conjuring and as a prophylactic against disease. A small piece of the r oot was chewed and blown on the body of a person who was preparing to travel as a way to ward off disease, but the smell was thought to aggravate snakes and cause them to bite the traveler. It could also be used as a soothsaying device by placing seven pieces of root put in one hand and gently rubbed with the other. The final position of the roots determined the outcome of the situation. It was taken for suicides and pois oning a victim. If the victim fell asleep after taking the root, they must be kept in motion unt il the effects wore off or they would not wake up (Mooney 1900: 424-425). A decoction of the roots was also used in sweat baths for a wide range of diseases (Mooney 1891: 333). In his notes, Mooney stressed that the stones used in the sweat bat h for healing purposes must be white. Kanas\u00e2la was also used for conjuring that was intended to take the life of a victim. The conjurer would take the spittle of his intended victim and mix it with several crushed earthworms and some splinters from some lightening stru ck wood. He would then put the paste in a 239 joint of the stem of C. maculata and ceremonially buries it. If all goes to plan, the victim dies within seven days (Mooney 1891: 392-393). Kanas\u00e2la was also used with other remedies to counter sicknesses sent by fri ends or rival conjurers to test the knowledge of a medicine man (Mooney 1891: 369) (see ts\u00e2liy\u00fast usd\u00edga above). Olbrechts found similar powers associated with kanas\u00e2la. If a medicine man had a patient die under his care, one option was to wash himself in a decoction of C. maculata (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 104). It was al so reported to be a contraceptive, a woman chewing a piece of the root for four consecutive days becoming permanently infertile (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 117). Ho wever, Witthoft disputed this claim, stating that Will West Long only told Olbr echts about this use after he \"questioned too closely about abortion-producing herbs (n.d.: 59) .\" The highly toxic nature of the root would cause mortality and insure that a woman taking the herb would \"bear no more children\". Olbrechts recorded another use for kanas\u00e2la as a divining tool. A person would chew up to seven pieces of the pl ant, approximately one-inch in length, to determine the duration of their life. If all seven were consumed without effect, the person would live for at least seven more years. But if they became \"drowsy or intoxicated\" before that point, their life w ould only be as long in years as the number of pieces of the plant they had consumed (Olbrechts 1930: 550). kanas\u00e2liy\u00fast - 'like kanas\u00e2la' Fernald - hairy angelica Angelica venenosa has already been discussed under the folk generic gan\u00e9lta. However, the synonym kanas\u00e2liy\u00fast is highlighted here to reiterate that the name 240 reflects the Cherokee perception of the resemblance of A. venenosa to Cicuta maculata . kan\u00e1stgw\u00e2l - no gloss - Caulophyllum thalictroides (L.) Michaux No gloss was provided by either Mooney or Olbrechts kan\u00e1stgw\u00e2l. sak\u00e1nige angelica, blue') due to the resemblance of C. thalictroides to members of the genera Angelica and Ligusticum . Olbrechts wrote that it was once us ed as medicine, but that the use had been forgotten. Banks recorded that the boil ed root was held against the tooth in case of a toothache and that a tea of the roots was used for pain after giving birth. The leaves were also rubbed on poison ivy (1953: 48). kaneguts\u00f6tagi - 'the skin has been taken away from where it was hanging' - Lilium canadense L. - Canada lily Olbrechts did not explain the association with the gloss for kaneguts\u00f6tagi and I can not speculate on its meaning. He was pr esented with two specimens for this folk genus, Lilium canadense and Erythronium americanum (see at\u00e1ts\u00fb amayutehi above), so the identification of kaneguts\u00f6tagi is questionable. He also found a large folk species, kaneguts\u00f6tagi \u00fatana , but he only identified it as a species of Lilium . He did identify it in The Swimmer Manuscript as the species that was made into a decoction and given to a child to drink, as well as bath in, to make them \"fleshy and fat\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 128). Banks found that L. canadense was combined with an orange red lily 241 (possibly Lilium philadelphicum L.) and made into a decoction for the pain of rheumatism (1953: 15). kat\u00fblat\u00fb 'my L. - dogbane, Indian hemp Mooney was not certain of the root of the folk generic kat\u00fblat\u00fb, but he speculated that it might have stemmed from kat\u00fblag\u00fb ('my leg is broken') or gat\u00fbl\u00edta ('I am holding my breath'). Will West Long later interpreted it as 'broke my leg' (Banks 1953: 104), while Witthoft glossed it as simply 'broken leg'. Witthoft also said the name had to do with the way the inner portion of t he stalk could be broken into short lengths while the outer fibers remained intact (n.d .: 70). Besides being known as the 'large' species of kat\u00fblat\u00fb, A. cannabinum was also known by the synonym kat\u00fblat\u00fb in\u00edgat ('my leg is broken, tall'). Two other plant s were described by an informant but samples were not collected. Mooney speculated that these were also A. cannabinum , but that they were named by their immediate condi tion and not because they were distinct species of kat\u00fblat\u00fb. They were called kat\u00fblat\u00fb \u00fastakal\u00fb \u00fatana ('my leg leaning against, large) and kat\u00fblat\u00fb \u00fastakal\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga ('my leg is broken, leaning against, small) because they were supported by nearby plants. Mooney claimed that the fibers from the stalk of A. cannabinum were once used to make bow strings. Banks added that a decoction of the roots was used for kidney problems and that the pounded plant was used as a poultice for rheumatic pains (1953: 104-105). 242 - Euphorbia corollata L. - flowering spurge Besides being the 'small' species of kat\u00fblat\u00fb, Mooney recorded several synonyms for E. corollata form the same informant and incorporating rearrangements of the same qualifiers. all due to the profuse milky latex. Olbrechts also recorded it as a species of ugatasig\u00edsk , it ugatasig\u00edsk g\u00fbtl\u00fbta tsuiyegsi ('pus oozes out, He also found it to be called ustagali , but gave no gloss for this name. The fibers of E. corollata were used for bow strings in much the same way as those from Apocynum cannabinum . Mooney also found that E. corollata was used for milky urine. About one pint of the beaten root s were soaked in warm water and drunk at intervals throughout the day. No food was tak en except for once at night. The treatment lasted for about 2 days. Olbrechts also found that E. corollata was used for urinary conditions such as uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white') and gayedi ('pain in the back') as well as the related condition g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they are eaten by them'). For this last condition, Olbrechts noted the symbolic corre lation between a milky discharge, the latex from the plant, and the avoidance of mi lk (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 180). Banks added that the bark of the roots was placed in a hollow tooth to ease a toothache and 243 the latex from the leaves and stem was us ed to heal sores and remove warts (1953: 77- 78). kkw ulas\u00fala ('shoe' or 'moccasin'), has the same basis as the common name lady's-slipper. T he lower lip of the flower is united into a pouch-like sac that resembles a shoe, mo ccasin, or slipper. Mooney claimed that there was only one variety, which was identified as a yellow variety, but in other notes he mentions the pink species using the same Cherokee name (Ms. 1894). Olbrechts used the same name for the smaller yellow va riety. It may well be that the Cherokee did not differentiate between the two yellow varietie s, but I think it is highly unlikely that the pink species would be placed in the same category. Mooney, apparently referring to the pink l ady's-slipper, found that the roots were boiled into a thick decoction and given to ch ildren for worms; however, Olbrechts wrote that it was the small yellow lady's-slipper that was used for the same purpose (Mooney and Olbrechts: 1932: 249). He also said that this was the variety that was gathered by the Cherokee and sold to white traders. Banks (1953: 20-22) differentiated betw een the three species, finding that the pink species was combined with a species of Sanicula for stomach cramps. The roots of the same were made into a tea for nervous conditions, kidney problems (either alone or combined with Comandra umbellata (L.) Nuttall), and \"female problems\" such as 244 menstrual irregularities and menopausal changes . A hot tea of four whole plants was said to relieve the pain of a hernia in bot h men and women. A root tea of the large yellow variety was used for a wide range of applications including colds and flu, kidney problems, nervous conditions, high fevers, and stomachaches. The roots of all three kinds of lady's-slipper were made into a decoction and drunk for diabetes. k\u00fbls\u00e9tsiy\u00fast - 'like honey locust' - Cassia fasciculata Michaux (honey locust - Gleditsia triacanthos L.) and -iy\u00fast ('like'), the suffix representing a resemblance to something else. In this case, the leaves of C. fasciculata are similar to those of G. triacanthos . Banks provided the only medicinal applications for C. fasciculata (1953: 68). The roots were used by ball players to ward off fatigue. It was mixed with Cassia marilandica and given to those experiencing feinting spells . It was also considered a sexual aid for older men. A woman would gather the pl ant and rub the scraped root on her vulva, thereby easing entry for a man who was at less than full potency. A man was not allowed to handle the plant, or it was believed that his penis would \"die\". k\u00fbng\u00fatsat\u00fb or k\u00fbng\u00fatsat - 'mean' lily or Lilium philadelphicum L. - wood lily Mooney's explanation of the etymology of k\u00fbng\u00fatsat\u00fb is dubious, but he identified the botanical species related to the names and his explanation warranted inclusion in this text. He speculated that k\u00fbng\u00fatsat\u00fb was from uneg\u00fatsat\u00fb ('it is mean'), based on the difficulty of removing the root in tact from the soil. The root was often dug 245 and used as an ingredient in bread. However, Will West Long did not agree with this explanation, and told Mooney that he thought the name was k\u00fbng\u00fatsat\u00fb k, from the root g\u00fatsnki\u00fb ('I am lifting up the skin, or cloth'). This is much closer to Olbrechts' observations (see kaneguts\u00f6tagi above), which may also have come from West Long. Banks observed that his informants often c onfused the names and identification of the species of Lilium (1953: 15). This may have been in part due to the plants becoming scarce due to the roots being a favored f ood of free-ranging hogs on the reservation (Witthoft n.d.: 33). Banks found that the roots of L. superbum were made into a decoction and rubbed on rheumatic joints and that a warm or cold infusion of the roots was used for flux (1953: 15). k\u00fbnts - Jerusalem artichoke - Helianthus tuberosus L. K\u00fbnts appears to be an opaque, proper name for the Jerusalem artichoke. Mooney said that this name had been replaced by n\u00fan, the folk generic for potato, but Witthoft still found a form of k\u00fbnts in use when he did his research decades later. Witthoft also found that the tubers were eaten ra w in the field or were baked or boiled as a vegetable. It was also semi-domesticated, being moved to more convenient locations for an easier harvest. 246 kwandis\u00e1t (Middle) or kw\u00e1nditl\u00e1 t (Upper) - 'they put it' tsish\u00fbsk\u00fb ('I am putting it upon it'). It is related to the string-like quality of this parasitic, leafless, twining vine, which was used as the webbing for drying racks for peaches and fish. Witthoft claimed that peaches were at one time the most important fruit available to the Cherokee, and that large quantities of a variety known as the \"winter peach\" were dried for storage (n. d.: 205). Mooney also found that a decoction of the roots was drunk by a woman four days after she had given birth, but he did not explain the purpose of the tr eatment. Olbrechts recorded Cuscuta as uduyo\u00e7\u00ed ('it has formed itself'), because the plant appears to have no roots and its growth was mysterious. kwaniy\u00fast ganul\u00fbh - 'peach-like herb' - ganul\u00fbh ('herb' or 'herbaceous'). This was due to the shape of the leaves, which were observed to be similar to those of a peach tree. The common name willow herb is due to the same observation. No furt her information is available concerning the Cherokee relationship with E. coloratum . n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk - 'it stands in the road' - Plantago major L. - broad-leafed plantain The name stems from n\u00fbn\u00e2h ('road' or 'trail') and udetk (Middle dialect) or ud\u00e9t (Upper dialect) ('it stands habitually in t he road') and is due to the erect seed stalks. 247 Both Mooney and Olbrechts collected several synonyms for n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk. Some were descriptive of the leaves such as tsugw\u00fbt\u00e9na n\u00fbn\u00e2 h udetk ('broad n\u00fbn\u00e2h ugwalaga gasakwal\u00fb ('it stands in the road, round leaved'). Others described the seed stalk n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk and kaw'st\u00fbnst, recorded P. major as a type of diysat\u00edsk ('it gets dew on it') tail' or 'mouse tail'). Olbrechts found major was used alone or with Agrimonia parviflora for diarrhea and that the root, cut in half lengt hwise, was made into an infusion and drunk for gig\u00f6 dunikstisg\u00f6i ('when they vomit blood'). The root was used for the condition known as 'their feet get hot', but Olbrec hts did not explain how it was used. Banks recorded Cherokee uses for the genus Plantago (1953: 119), but it will be assumed here that they apply to P. major, as it is the most common species in the region. The wilted leaves were used as a poultice for bee stings, headaches, infected sores, and rheumatism. An infusi on of the leaves of plantain and Juncus tenuis was given to a toddler who was learning to walk. This may have been due to the erect habit of both plants, symbolizing the ability to stand up straight. If the child failed to walk, he or she was considered to be afflicted with rheumatism. 248 n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk \u00fatan - 'it stands in the road, large' - Lespedeza striata (Thunberg) H. & A. - Japanese clover Mooney said that this species was unknow n in the region until a few years before he did his research among the Cherokee (Ms. 2235). No further information about it was available. nuniy\u00fast - 'like potato' - Matelea spp . from n\u00fan ('potato') and -iy\u00fast ('like'), which is due to the tuberous roots. Mooney discussed nuniy\u00fast in Myths of the Cherokees (1900: 426), but does not identify the botani cal species associated with the name. Olbrechts collected and identified it as a species of Matalea , and claimed that this is the species that Mooney was referring to, but in his description Mooney said that nuniy\u00fast was a flowering vine that grew in old fields. Species of Matalea tend to favor wooded areas and the flowers tend to be small, r eaching only around 2 cm across (Radford et al. 1968: 858-860). While Olbrechts may hav e collected and identified a species of Matalea , it is more likely that Mooney was discussing Ipomoea pandurata , which will be discussed below. Both species have tuberous roots, cordate leaves, and twining vines that are reminiscent of sweet potatoes, Ipomoea batatas , but I. pandurata has large, showy that nuniy\u00fast was used with Podophyllum peltatum for stomachaches and that it was used for dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). 249 nuniy\u00fast klayuh \u00fatan old fields, large' - Ipomoea pandurata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer - man-root As the common name suggests, the tuber ous root can be very large. Mooney found a specimen were the root was 3 feet long. This is the only nuniy\u00fast that he identified in his notes and is most likely the species discussed in his published materials. Mooney found that the milky latex of nuniy\u00fast was rubbed on an object that emulated the bleat of a young deer, which would a ttract its mother to the vicinity of the hunter (Mooney 1900: 426). Banks found that a r oot tea was used medicinally for bowel complaints and the root bark was made into a poultice for rheumatic pains (1953: 106). He also wrote that a tea of the roots was used to soak sweet potato plants as a deterrent to moles and insect pests. Although this was called \"Indian potato\" by local whites, Witthoft could find no evidence t hat the Cherokee ever used the root as a food product. He claimed that many wild r oots were called \"Indian potato\" (n.d.: 33), and that use of \"Indian\" in the name was a dispar aging term referring to a false or counterfeit type (n.d.: 36). nuyag\u00fbl - 'it climbs the rocks' (Michaux) Small - heartleaf or Asarum canadense L. - wild ginger The folk generic nuyag\u00fbl stems from n\u00fbya ('rock' or ('I am climbing'). The name refers to the plant's ability to grow on moss covered rocks. Mooney identified nuyag\u00fbl as Hexastylis the synonym skw\u00e1l- 250 utana ('liverleaf, large') for the respective species mentioned. The folk genus skw\u00e1l- will be discussed below. Mooney found that a hot infusion of the bruised roots was used for coughs, or the root could simply be chewed for the same purpose. The root was also dried for future use. The leaves were used in a formula with Alnus serrulata , Carpinus caroliniana and cancers. Olbrechts found that nuyag\u00fbl was used for the ethnomedical conditions aninedzi ada n\u00f6woti tuksinig\u00f6way\u00f6 nategs\u00f6i ('their breast, to cure anyone with, terrapin does it to them, as they go little people frighten them'). He found that it was used for milky urine and sores in the abdominal region. For the latter condition, the roots are made into a decoction and this was blown over the afflicted region with a tube. This was also an herb of commerce that was sold to the white herb buyers. Banks added that a tea of the roots of A. canadense was drunk for heart trouble, menstrual irregularity, and colds, whil e a as a blood tonic and to improv e the appetite (1953: 38). Witthoft (1947) added that the dried leaves were used as a snuff and the fresh leaves for healing wounds. nuyag\u00fbl usd\u00ed-ga - 'it climbs the rocks, small' - Galax aphylla L. - galax This is the 'small' species of the pr evious folk genus. Mooney also recorded the synonym tsugwal\u00e1ga tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb ('round leaves'), due to the appearance of the ovate 251 leaves. Olbrechts reported that it was onc e used, but that the use had been forgotten. However, Banks found that a tea of the r oots was used for kidney problems (1953: The name from sal\u00e2l ('squirrel ') and usuga ('claw'), which is due to the long, curved, black fruits. Olbrechts recorded it as uniwoti tsunosut oh (no gloss) and said that the stalks were rolled in the hand while praying. Witthoft said the greens were eaten in the spring and the roots were either pounded and added to bread or were boiled or baked and eaten as a vegetable (n.d.: 28). sats\u00fbnn - Rudbeckia laciniata L. - green coneflower Sats\u00fbnn appears to be an opaque, proper name for the green coneflower. It was also one of the Middle dialect forms, the other being kats\u00fbnn, while the Upper dialect form was kats\u00fbna. Olbrechts identified it as Hydrophyllum canadense L., but I believe this is a misidentification on his part. Its main use was as a spring green, and Witthoft claimed that it was likely to be t he more conservative individuals who consumed the greens (n.d.: 25). They would be picked early in the spring, parboiled in three or four changes of water, and cooked in grease (Witthoft 1977). Mooney also recorded a medicinal use, finding that the roots were boiled down into a thick syrup and this would be put in the ear in case of an earache. The plant was often transplanted into gardens for easy access (Banks 1953: 132). Witthoft (1977) claimed that R. laciniata was a very 252 toxic plant, but other references suggest that any poisoning attributed to it may have been due to other plants (Muenscher 1975:233). slikw\u00e2ya - slikw\u00e2ya ('green snake') was used to refer to the resemblance of the leaves of E. yuccifolium and Y. filamentosa to the rough green snake, Opheodrys aestivus L. (Fradkin 1990: 145). There is some confusion as to the designation of folk species in this genus as Mooney identified E. yuccifolium as slikw\u00e2ya and E. yuccifolium as slikw\u00e2ya Banks referred to both simply as slikw\u00e2ya (1953: 19, 94). The confusion with species identification makes it difficult to relate the synonyms to a botanical species, but I will include them here to provide a more complete record. Mooney recorded the synonym slikw\u00e2ya tl\u00e2ges h ('green snake, yuccifolium and ig\u00e2tenh ('swamp growing green snake') for Olbrechts referring to the root) and s\u00f6ti (no gloss) for E. yuccifolium and slikw\u00e2ya tl\u00e2ges h ('green snake, growing in old fields') and ayelsti (no gloss) for Y. filamentosa . Again, his identification of slikw\u00e2ya tl\u00e2gesh as Y. filamentosa is counter to Mooney's record. Olbrechts recorded the bulk of the uses for E. yuccifolium , finding it was used for the ethnomedical conditions amayiutsistano utsya (he is sick by the water'), are eaten bad odors'). He wrote that a decoction was given to children as a prophylactic against whooping cough (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 76), but in his notes he elaborated and said it was a prophylactic against all contagious diseases. Informant Will West Long reported that Y. filamentosa was one of the ingredients used in a sacramental drink in the Cherok ee version of the Green Corn Ceremony. He included it in his list of the plants used in the Ceremony and identified it as one of the three obligatory plants included in the drink (Banks 1953: 155). He also said that the roots and leaves were soaked in water and drunk by those afflicted with diabetes (Witthoft 1946). An early 19 th century account reported that the pounded roots were used to wash blankets and as a fish pois on (Witthoft 1947), indicating a high saponin content in the roots. White (1975) claimed that the young shoots of Y. filamentosa were parboiled or fried in grease and eaten by t he Cherokee. But Witthoft disputed this and claimed that this was a misidentificati on on White's part, and that he was actually referring to a species of Tradescantia , which also goes by the common name slikw\u00e2yaiy\u00fast - 'like green - bunch-flower The name slikw\u00e2yaiy\u00fast suggests that the Cherokee considered this to be 'like' slikw\u00e2ya. Olbrechts did not elaborate on the etymology of the name, but he did record the synonym slikw\u00e2ya g\u00fbtl\u00fbt h ('green snake, dwelling on the hillside'. He 254 also said it was used for dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('yellow urine'). No further information is sel-\u00fbnage - 'black greens' - Solanum ptycanthum Dunal from s\u00e9la ('greens') and \u00fbnage ('black'), due to the dark color of the cooked greens . Mooney also found the Catawba name yh\u00e1 iwoktc ('greens, black') used by one of his in formants. He claimed that the greens were much esteemed by both the Cherokee and the Catawba, and that they were often gathered and sold. The leaves were also us ed medicinally for cuts, lesions, and skin poisoning. The leaves were crushed, strai ned through a cloth, and the juice made into a salve for topical application. Banks added that a large quantity of a tea of the leaves and stems was drunk every four days and used as an emetic to clear the saliva and relieve the sense of loss of those mourning the death of a loved one (1953: 115). s\u00e9luts - 'corn's mother' - Sonchus asper s\u00e9lu ('corn') and ust ('his mother'). Mooney attributed this name to tall grass, possibly Tripsicum dactlyoides L., but this will be investigated in the chapter on grasses. But Olbrechts association of Sonchus asper with the corn plant warranted its inclusion in this section. He sa id that it was a common plant in cornfields and that the old people never touched it when they hoed the corn, \"as the corn would be sorry if the pulled it out.\" It is not at all clear why this was the case. Species of Sonchus are considered detrimental to certain field crops and can reduce yields in grain fields (Peschken 1982). However, they also contain a group of phytochemicals known as 255 sesquiterpene lactones (Shimizu et al. 1989, Helal et al. 2000), of which one has been shown to promote root growth in cuttings from bean plants (Shibaoka et al. 1967). Until more is known about the chemical ecology of the genus Sonchus , we will not know how the growth of S. asper affects corn production or if this effect would be altered by the integrated style of gardening used by the Cherokee. Mooney also recorded S. asper referring similar growth pattern as thistles and the spines on the leaves. skw' un\u00edgist - 'hog food' - spp. ('hog') and un\u00edgist ('food'). Mooney and name for Oenothera biennis (see at\u00e1ts\u00fb-iy\u00fast above) and both are weedy, edible species that would provide nut ritious fodder for the hogs. Mooney did not provide an exact botanical identification but simply called the plant \"speckled dock\", a common name that could apply to one of several species. Mooney claimed that pregnant women drank an infusion of the whole root to ease the pains of childbirth. Banks (1953: 40), in his discussion of Rumex crispus L., found that the tea was given to women in labor and a strong infusion was given to pregnant women to reduce the loss of blood w hen giving birth. The root was also made into a tea to relieve constipation and to bui ld blood in the spring when sores were slow to heal. Beaten roots were also fed to horses with stomach ailments. 256 sk\u00e2ti-n\u00fbwa - no gloss - Sericocarpus linifolius (L.) B.S.P. - white-topped aster Mooney did not provide a gloss for this folk generic, but it may be a form of the following entry (Ms. 2235). No further inform ation is available concerning the Cherokee relationship to this species. sk\u00e1y't - 'worm killer' - Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh - rose pink, gentian The folk generic sk\u00e1y't stems from tsg\u00e2ya ('worm' or and t\u00edh, form of t\u00edhih ('killer'). Mooney did not prov ide an explanation for the source of the name and I know of no application of S. angularis as a vermifuge. Mooney also recorded the gloss) and \u00fbtsat uskw\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like fish bladder'). A tea of the plant was used to treat diarrhea. skw\u00e1l usd\u00ed-ga - 'small liverleaf' - Hepatica acutiloba Mooney speculated on the gloss for skw\u00e1i, suggesting that it may have stemmed from uskw\u00e2l ('stomach'). It is someti mes referred to as simply skw\u00e1l, but is often accompanied by the modifier usd\u00ed-ga to distinguish it from nuyag\u00fbl (see above), which could also be recognized with the but did not provide a gloss or name a large variety. Mooney mentioned in his notes that H. acutiloba had several uses, but only two appear in his published materials (Mooney 1891: 326). The leaves or roots were chewed or made into a tea and drunk by a person with a cough. It was also combined with Asplenium rhyzophyllum as an emetic to treat a person who had dreams of snakes. In his notes he elaborated on the treatment, sa ying that the roots or leaves of both 257 plants were used and the decoction boiled to \u00bd or its original volume. Liverleaf plants were also harvested and sold to white tr aders. Mooney was of the opinion that the Cherokee esteem for the plant grew with market demand for the leaves. Olbrechts found it was used for several ethnomedical conditions including aninedzi ada n\u00f6woti tuksinig\u00f6way\u00f6 nategs\u00f6i ('their breast, to cure anyone with, terrapin does it to them, as they go little people frighten them'). Banks found that the roots were used hot in tea for bowel complaints and in a decoction drunk on the new moon as a prophylactic against whooping cough. The dried leaves were smoked for heart troubles, as well as crushed and made into a tea for toothaches (1953: or Asarum canadense L. - wild ginger Both botanical species here were discussed above (see nuyag\u00fbl) but are included here to associate the botanical spec ies with the Cherokee folk species. skwaye\u00ed\u00fb - no gloss - Lespedeza stuevei Nutall This was another species on Mooney's list of botanical species and Cherokee names (Ms. 2235). No other information is available about this species. 258 s\u00fbnna dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk - '?, L. - sneeze- weed Mooney did not provide a gloss for s\u00fbnna , but it appears to be a shortened form of sats\u00fbnn (see above). Helenium autumnale was discussed in is a purple flowered species of s\u00fbnna , but it also identified 'large') (see atsils\u00fbt above). This same name was used for a species of fern, Osmunda cinnamomea , and referred to its use as an agent to smoke animals out of logs and yellow jackets out of the hive so the larvae could be harvested for consumption (see eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil usd\u00ed in the s\u00fbtl' - Anthemis cotula L. - dog fennel The name s\u00fbtliy\u00fast stems from the resemblance of A. cotula to Pycanthemum incanum (see g\u00e1w's\u00fbk un\u00e9ga in Herbaceous Plants, Part 1), which has the name s\u00fbtl as one of its synonyms. No other informat ion is available concerning the Cherokee relationship with this plant. 259 tagual - no gloss - T. subaspera Ker. or Tradescantia virginiana L. - bear grass, spiderwort Tagual appears to be an opaque, proper name for these larger members of the genus Tradescantia . Tradescantia virginiana (often recorded as researchers (Mooney , Witthoft 1947, Banks 1953:12, Perry 1974: 33), but this is a rare species found in t he lower Piedmont and not a species that is found in the mountains of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 271). But all did agree that the young shoots of Tradescantia were one of the favorite spring greens of the Cherokee. Olbrechts found that the plant was used for swollen testicles and for the condition involving a prolapsed rectum known as g\u00f6skanugoga ('arse bowel falls out'). Banks added that a tea of the whole plant was pr epared with six other plants and drunk for female complaints and rupture. It was also used as an ingredient in a kidney medicine, the roots were made into a tea for over eating, and the roots were pounded and used as a poultice for cancerous growths (Banks 1953: 12-13). takaya di Michaux - pinweed Mooney provided little information about this plant other than the Cherokee name and botanical name, along with the synonym w\u00e2tige ukt\u00fb t ('brown seeds'). usitatissimum L. - flax Tal\u00e9ta appears to be a proper, opaque folk generic for plants that have usable fibers. Mooney speculated that this name was once originally applied to Pilea pumila 260 (see below), but that it was transferred to flax as it gained cultural prominence. The name might also have been applied to hemp. Witthoft called the name, \"a very interesting linguistic fossil\" because it was the same name used for a tote sack, which was a burlap bag or feed sack to haul objects (n.d.: 69). The only medicinal application was from Olbrechts, who found that a decoc tion of the plant is used as a wash for patients with an attack of the fever (Mooney and Olbrechts is the 'small' folk species of tal\u00e9ta , also known by the synonyms tal\u00e9ta unitsistaligiski (no gloss) and \u00fayalug\u00edsk ('it gets cut, as by a blade of grass'), possibly having to do with the toughness of the fibers. This is a member of the nettle family, Urticaceae, a family whose members are k nown as a source of vegetable fibers. A hot infusion of the whole plant or just the roots was made from the pounded plant and used for intestinal worms. The pat ient would skip breakfast and drink the tea continuously from early in the morning until dinner. It was also combined with Spigelia marilandica (see g\u00edgag\u00e9 adsil\u00fbsk above) and another unidentified plant and used for the same purpose. The tea was drunk three times in a day with no special dietary restrictions. Banks added that an infusion of the plant was given to children to quell excessive hunger and the stem was rubbed between itching toes (1953: 34-35). 261 tal\u00e9ta - Laportea canadensis is the only native stinging nettle found in the North Carolina mountains. The European stinging nettle , Urtica dioica L. (as U. gracilis ), was reportedly used by the Cherokee (Banks 1953: 35, Witthoft n.d.: 69), but it is not commonly found near the Cherokee reservation (Radford et al. 1968: 393). Due to this ambiguity, I will include the uses for Urtica under this heading. Mooney did not explain the name, but it appears that the qualifier tsunsdi (the plural form of usd\u00edga or 'small') is used to modify andats\u00fbsk ('stinging' or 'smarting') and is in reference to the stinging hairs on all parts of the plant. These hairs would be much smaller than the thorns usually associated with plants that cause mechanical discomfort. Mooney also recorded the synonym tal\u00e9ta uniyalugiski (no gloss). Witthoft found that the fibers of Urtica were used to make the bowstrings for children's bows. The plant was harvested imm ediately after it had been killed by a frost (n.d.: 69). In the same reference, he referred to L. canadensis as tal\u00e9taiy\u00fast ('like tal\u00e9ta '). Banks found that Urtica was rubbed on a patient after the stinging hairs had been burned off to relieve an upset stomach. He also found that the whole plant was pounded and made into a warm infusion for intermittent fevers (1953: 35). tciskwa dunotcilu gi - 'the Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton - beefsteak plant Olbrechts did not explain the meaning of this name, but it appears to be due to the appearance of the purple leaves. He also recorded the synonym anitciskwa ('they 262 birds'). He found the roots were used as a love attraction medicine, but he did not elaborate on this. However, Bank described a similar plant, Phryma leptostachya , which was used in the same manner and considered efficacious due to the symbolism of the intended union inherent in the pairing of the flowers (see uktan\u00e9ga ud\u00e2 below). The introduced P. frutescens has similar paired flowers and grows prolifically once its established, so it may have replaced the native Phryma leptostachya as a love attraction medicine. tiliy\u00fast - Aruncus dioicus (Walter) Fernald The tiliy\u00fast stems from til ('chestnut') and - iyust ('like'), due to the resemblance of the inflorescence of A. dioicus to that of the chestnut tree. identified tiliy\u00fast as a synonym for Cicuta maculata , but this is an obvious misidentification as not part of the plant has a distinct resemblance to the chestnut tree. Banks provided the only medicinal uses for A. dioicus , finding that a decoction of the pounded root was used for excessive urination. The pounded root was also used as a poultice for bee stings of the face and eyes. An infusion of the roots was used to soak swollen feet and pregnant women drank a hot tea of the roots to prevent blood loss and pain due to childbirth (1953: 60). tl\u00fbt\u00edst stems from tl\u00fbt\u00edst ('pheasant') and un\u00edgist ('food'), due to the berries that persist on the plant through the winter. It is also the source of the common name partridge berry. 263 Mooney found that the whole plant was made into a decoction and given to children who had diarrhea that was caused by spoiled mother's milk. It was drunk for three to four days. Banks found that a tea of the roots was given prophylactically to newborns to prevent the same condition, as well as combined with Hieracium venosum for diarrhea and for menstrual pains. He also found the belief that a pregnant cat would abort if it ate the internal organs of a pheas ant. A tea of the leaves prevented the cat from aborting (1953: 120). tl\u00fbt\u00fbts gat\u00e1ga utana - folk species tl\u00fbt\u00fbts gat\u00e1ga utana was recorded n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk above) . No further information is available concerning this plant. ts\u00e1yatih - pokeweed - Phytolacca americana L. Ts\u00e1yatih appears to be an opaque, common name. Mooney found four variations, two from the Middle dialect ( ts\u00e1yatih or ts\u00e1ytg) and two from Upper dialect ( tl\u00e1yat or tl\u00e1yag). Olbrechts found it was used medicinally for such conditions as cancer (combined with Chamaesyce maculata ), swelling of the body, and gayedi ('pain in the back'). Banks added that the dried roots were powdered and sprinkled on old sores, the fresh roots were pounded and made into a cold infusion to increase urine flow, and the berries were made into wine and drunk for rheumatism (1953: 42). Pokeweed was considered a healthful spring green by the Cherokee. The young shoots were picked, boiled in a couple of changes of water, and then fried in grease 264 (Witthoft 1977). The Cherokee believed t hat the greens were a good blood builder (Banks 1953: 43). The berries, generally considered toxic, were also used to add color to canned fruit and were made into a beverage with sour grapes, sugar, and cornmeal (Perry 1974: 52). tsg\u00e1\u00fb dig\u00e1gwat g dal\u00e2nige - jackets on, yellow' - Solidago spp. - goldenrod The ts\u00edgwat sku ('I am putting it on it') due the utility of its stem as a skewer to string yellow jackets combs. The pupae of yellow jackets was a favored food of the Cherokee and was made into soup stock or were roasted and eaten out of hand (Witthoft n.d.: 162). After the insects were smoked away from the nest (see eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil usd\u00ed in chapter on ferns), the brood combs were strung on the stem of a plant. One to several species of goldenrod was appar ently used for this purpose, the qualifier dal\u00e2nige ('yellow') referring to the color of tsg\u00e1\u00fb dig\u00e1gwat g gigage uy\u00f6du wit\u00f6 - - Symphyotrichum laeve (L.) A.& D. L\u00f6ve var. smooth aster Olbrechts did not explain the vari ous components of the Cherokee name for S. laevis, but this appears to be the red stemmed variety of plants used to string the brood combs of hornet's nest. Olbrechts found that - - Cirsium altissimum (L.) Sprengel - tall thistle This is, to my knowledge, the only example of onomatopoeia in the Cherokee ethnobotanical classification system. The down from this thistle was used for the fletching on blowgun darts and the name ts\u00edts represents the sound the darts make as they are blown from the gun, as well as being the name for the dart. Mooney and Olbrechts both recorded like C. altissimum , but having sticky heads. It is not clear if this was another distinct species or an indication of species diversity for C. altissimum . Olbrechts mentions ts\u00edts unig\u00e1tsalag\u00edst , but does not provide a botanical identification. Mooney found that the root roots of ts\u00edts were used to treat swelling and pain in the abdomen from adding new foods to the diet. This could happen on a seasonal basis and Mooney claimed that the Green Corn Ceremony was an attempt to avoid this condition. The roots of ts\u00edts were mixed with those of Erechtites hieracifolium and the whole plant of Impatiens pallida and made into a tea. It was also used for similar conditions such as dal\u00e2ni ('yellow') and overeating. For overeating, an infusion was made by pouring hot water over the bruis ed roots and/or leaves and drunk by the patient. tsunsdia - this is referred to as the 'small' ts\u00edts, the bull thistle is a robust field pest naturalized from Europe. Although it can reach a height of 2 meters, it is still smaller by comparison to C. altissimus , which can reach up to 3 meters in height (Radford et al. 266 1968: 1043). This may have been the same species Olbrechts identified as ts\u00edts usd\u00edga , which he found was used with C. altissimum for dal\u00e2ni accompanied by swelling. tsitsiy\u00fast - 'like ts\u00edts' - Erechtites hieracifolia (L.) Raf. - fireweed The folk generic tsitsiy\u00fast stems from ts\u00edts (see above) and the suffix -iy\u00fast ('like'), due to the sharply pointed teeth on the lanceolate leaves, resembling those of the thistles. Mooney also recorded it as atsitsag\u00fbniski tsitsiy\u00fast usd\u00edga (no gloss, 'like thistle, small'), this being labeled as the 'small' variety to distinguish it from the 'large' variety, Sonchus asper (see s\u00e9luts above). Mooney may have reversed these Cherokee names, as E. hieracifolia is generally much larger than S. asper . Olbrechts recorded E. hieracifolia as kwandisoti and s\u00f6na , but did not provide a gloss for either. Mooney found that it was used like the this tles to treat swelling and pain in the abdomen from adding new foods to the diet (see ts\u00edts above). Olbrechts wrote that the use was secret and the plant is not menti oned in the sacred formulas, but an informant told him that it was used, \"to prevent menses from appearing after the birth of a child.\" A cold infusion of the outer layer was drunk immediately after the child was delivered and it was believed that this would prevent mens truation until the next birth. It was also used for the condition aktoli yut\u00f6ya ('when their eyes hurt'). tsk\u00e2yay ay ('a particle'), implying that the object is on the inside. This was due to insect larvae that burrow into 267 the stalks. Little else is known about this plant, other than Mooney's note that it was yellow, around 5 feet tall, and grew in river bottoms. tsug\u00e2sk \u00fatan or ug\u00e2sk \u00fatan - 'rottener, L. - white lettuce, rattlesnake root The botanical identification may be questionable here, as P. alba is only locally common in the North Carolina mountains (R adford et al. 1968: 1020), but this could be another large species of Prenanthes . Tsug\u00e2sk is the plural form of ug\u00e2sk, stemming from aktih\u00fb ('it is rotting it'). This was because the root was chewed when one had an aching tooth, but this caused the tooth to rot, which would aid in its removal. The bruised leaves were used as a poultice to bring a boil to a head. A warm infusion of the root or leaves was used to relieve piles or children's discomfort from straining with a bad case of diarrhea. The tea was applied to the anus while warm. Prenanthes alba could be used alone or with the small variety of tsug\u00e2sk (see below). Olbrechts associated the folk generic tsug\u00e2sk with Taraxicum officinale Wiggers, the common dandelion. It is not clear if this is a misidentification on his part or if T. officinale was considered a type of tsug\u00e2sk. However, he did not record it as used for toothaches, which would establish it as a 'rottener', just a remedy for diarrhea. tsug\u00e2sk This 'small' small species of the folk genus tsug\u00e2sk ('rottener'). It was used in place of or in conjunction with tsug\u00e2sk \u00fatan. 268 tsugwal\u00e1ga tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb - 'round leaves' - Senecio aureus L. - golden ragwort This name was a composite of tsugwal\u00e1ga , the plural form of ugwalaga ('leaf'), and tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb , the plural form of g\u00e1sakwal\u00fb ('round'). This was due to the shape of the basal leaves. Mooney was also given a specimen of Galax aphylla , and told it was also tsugwal\u00e1ga tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb (see nuyag\u00fbl usd\u00ed-ga above), indicating that some specimens were named on the spot due to outstanding morphological features. Mooney also labeled his voucher specimen of S. aureus as dal\u00e2ni adsil\u00fb sk ('yellow flower'), one of several referred to above (see dal\u00e2ni ganul\u00fbhi gadus\u00ed-ehi ). A warm infusion of the crushed, whole plant of tsugwal\u00e1ga tig\u00e1sakwal\u00fb was drunk for four days, all day long, to treat yellow urine. No salt, lye, or hot food was taken during this treatment. tsugw\u00fbnstts\u00e2l - 'the leaves taper' - Geranium carolinianum L. - Carolina cranesbill The name tsugw\u00fbnstts\u00e2l, recorded by Olbrechts, is the same name Mooney recorded for Quercus rubra (see chapter on trees). It was not explained in either man's notes, but in reference to G. carolinianum it appears to refer to the deeply cut lobes of the leaves, which taper towards the point w here they are palmately attached. Olbrechts also recorded the synonym aniy\u00fast ('like strawberry'), presumably due to the resemblance of some part of the plant to wild strawberries. He found it was used to treat the condition uyoi aniay\u00f6l\u00f6\u00e7i ('when they have inhaled bad odors'). Michaux - green adder's mouth The folk genus tsulg\u00e9ta is the plural form of klag\u00e9s ('field'), but Mooney could find no evident reason for this name because he found the plant in the mountains, not near garden areas. He recorded t he name of a large counterpart, tsulg\u00e9ta \u00fatan , but did not provide a botanical name with it. No further information is available concerning the Cherokee relationship to either species of tsulg\u00e9ta. tsun\u00e1tl\u00fb-h or untl\u00fbh - 'it presses against something' - no botanical species Tsun\u00e1tl\u00fb-h is the plural form of untl\u00fbh. The name was due to the leaves, which grow pressed against the stem. The root of tsun\u00e1tl\u00fb-h was boiled with the root of another unidentified plant and used for gono rrhea and diarrhea. For gonorrhea, known to the Cherokee as kayet ('whites'), the sliced roots were boiled into a red tea. This was drunk all day on the first day while fasting, and continued for three more days while skipping breakfast. For diarrhea, the decoction of the roots was drunk for 1 to 2 days, but fasting was not required. The plant was not dried for storage, but could be found in winter by its upright stalks. tsunihy\u00fbst - 'they are bitter' snakeroot, st was the plural form of uhy\u00fbst ('bitter') and is due to the intensely bitter quality inherent in the gentians. Mooney recorded the name tsunihy\u00fbst tsuntana ('bitter, large'), indicating that there was more than one species of tsunihy\u00fbst, but he 270 only identified it to the genus Gentiana (Ms. 2235). There are several species of Gentiana found in the North Carolina mountains, and there is no reason to believe that the Cherokee only used one of these. Gentiana villosa was the only Cherokee plant mentioned for abortion, yet, while it was recorded in Mooney's notes on Cherokee botany, it was ignored by Olbrechts when he penned The Swimmer Manuscrip t. In fact, he said that abortion was totally unknown among the Cherokee and his informants we re horrified at the thought when he explained the concept. This is one example of how the work, though attributed to the works of Mooney, was predominantly based on Olbrechts' field work and little of Mooney's data on the use of plants were included in the finished product. Mahoney (1857: 217) said that this plant, which he recorded as oo-har-stee (similar to the singular form uhy\u00fbst), was in all Cherokee formulas for \"obstructed menstruation\", a reference that usually indicates abortion. Mooney also found that a warm decoction of the bruised root, weaker than that used for abortion, was drunk for \"crampy colic\" and heart palpitations. tsunts\u00e2y'st usd\u00ed-ga - 'it - creeping lady's sorrel Mooney wrote that tsunts\u00e2y'st ('it is sour') is the same word used to indicate vinegar. The yellow flowered members of the genus Oxalis are taxonomically difficult (Smith 1999: 88) so this and the following Cherokee species may represent a recognition of only two kinds, a large and a small folk species of tsunts\u00e2y'st. Mooney found that a decoction of the bruised plant wa s used as a mordant to fix dye colors to 271 thread and fabric. Olbrechts also identified tsunts\u00e2y'st usd\u00ed-ga as O. corniculata and found that the root was chewed for spoiled saliva. Banks discussed the genus Oxalis , avoiding the separate species all together. He found wide, varied applications for the genus (1953: 75). The leaves of two separate species were chewed as a remedy for conditions of the saliva, one to cure spoiled saliva and another for \"disordered saliva\", a condition where the saliva \"tastes bitter and dry\". His informant, Will West Long, was cl ear that the two conditions were not the same. A salve made of sheep grease and a decoction made from the leaves of Oxalis was used on sores and the extracted juice from the leaves was used in the early stages of skin cancer. A cold tea of the leaves wa s drunk as an anti-emetic and a tea the whole plant was given to children for hookworm. The child would drink the tea and was also be bathed in it. tsunts\u00e2y'st \u00fatana - 'it is sour, large' - Oxalis stricta L. - yellow wood sorrel This was the 'large' species of tsunts\u00e2y'st. The name probably also referred to Oxalis grandis Small, a similar large species of sorrel. Mooney said it was used as a mordant in the same manner as tsunts\u00e2y'st usd\u00ed-ga . Olbrechts did not designate a botanical species, but did record that tsunts\u00e2y'st \u00fatana was used for un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc sour' - Verbena urticifolia L. - white vervain Mooney did not explain the name, but the similarity to the genus Oxalis must have to do with a sour flavor, as the plant s are morphologically very different. Nothing else was recorded concerning the Cherokee relationship to this plant. tsuskwan\u00fb n - 'blanket' - Heuchera villosa Michaux - name tsuskwan\u00fb n ('blanket') refers to the downy appearance of the leaves, but the term literally means 'stripes' (stemming from ut\u00fbtan\u00fbn or 'stripe'), because Cherokee trade blankets were originally stri ped. The name was also used for plants that had zonal color differences resembling stripes. As the specific epithet suggests, the undersides of the leaves are covered with so ft hairs, suggesting the source of the name. Olbrechts called Hydrophyllum canadense L. tsuskwan\u00fb n, but this may have been a case of misidentification, as the young leaves resemble those of H. villosa . However, Olbrechts did gloss tsuskwan\u00fb n as 'it is striped', and this may have been due to the variations in color on the leaves of H. canadense . Contrary to Heuchera americana , the other member of this genus that was known to the Cherokee (see and\u00e1nkalag\u00edsk above), no medicinal properties were attributed to H. villosa . tsuskw\u00fbt - 'it - round-headed bush clover The Cherokee name, common name, and s pecific epithet all point to the distinguishing feature of L. capitata , a compact inflorescence that has a head-like quality. The name stems from uska ('head') or dakskwut\u00fb ('I have a head'). Mooney also recorded it as uskw\u00fbt, which is obviously the singular form of tsukw\u00fbt, but he 273 said it also glossed as 'a pin'. This was due to the use of its stalks as the shaft of blowgun darts and the name was transferred to a dressmaker's pin. A one-foot long section of the stalk was trimmed and s harpened, making a sturdy, lightweight dart. These were then fletched with the down of the tall thistle, Cirsium ts\u00edts (Witthoft n.d.: uskw\u00fbt as 'it has a taproot', but provided no explanation for this gloss. Mooney recorded another species, Lespedeza hirta (L.) Hornemann, as also being used for the shafts of blowgun darts. He did not provide a gloss for the Cherokee name, \u00faskwayeh , but it appears to be related to uskw\u00fbt. ts\u00fatlagalak g\u00fbtl\u00fbth - 'spread legs, growing on the concolor (L.) Nesom - eastern silvery the etymology of ts\u00fatlagalak ('spread legs'), but A. concolor can have several stems emanating from a single rhizome (Radford et al. 1968: 1080). The uses have already been discussed above (see k\u00e2st\u00fata t lug\u00e9). It appears, because there is a specific qualifier, that there are other species of ts\u00fatlagalak , but no others were recorded. tsuswat\u00fana tsunsdi am\u00e1yan 'sinews, spp . - pondweed Mooney only mentioned the Cherokee name and genus for this plant, so the name will be explained by analyzing its components. Tsuswat\u00fana stems from wat\u00fana ('sinew' or 'vein'), but in this instance I do not know why it was referred to in this way. As 274 the common name pondweed suggests, these are aquatic plants and the qualifier am\u00e1yanh ('growing in water') incorporates the habitat into the name. The qualifier tsunsdi , the plural form of usd\u00ed-ga ('small'), suggests that there was a large variety, but none was recorded. No medicinal qualitie s were attributed to this plant. tsuwat\u00faniy\u00fast - 'like tsuswat\u00fana ' - Trifolium repens L. - white clover The name indicates that tsuwat\u00faniy\u00fast was considered to resemble a member of the folk genus tsuswat\u00fana , but Mooney did not clarify which plant. It would most likely have been Euonymus americanus (see tsuswat\u00fana in the chapter on shrubs), a plant that was sometimes labeled by the folk generic without modifiers. Mooney also presumably because was eaten by the Cherokee's pigs (see skw' un\u00edgist above). This is an introduced species and the Cherokee would say the following about T. repens : \"y\u00fbneka tsuk\u00fb nawat\u00e9g \" or \"it follows the white man\". A cold infusion of the bruised roots was used, after scratching, to bathe a patient suffering from rheumatism. tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl- Iris verna L. and Iris cristata Aiton - dwarf iris The folk generic tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl ('it grows in bunches') was in reference to low-growing plants with leaves that grew in tufts. The specific qualifier, inagh, stemmed from inag\u00e9 ('wild' or 'wilderness') the synonym uy\u00e1tl usd\u00ed-ga ('it makes a ridge, small'), because the rhizome makes a ridge of earth (see uy\u00e1tl below). No medicinal uses were attributed to tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl inagh. 275 tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl kutlah - 'it grows in bunches, growing under the beech tree' - Viola rotundifolia Michaux - round-leaved yellow violet The for this species of tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl stems from kutl\u00fb ('beech') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). The implication of this name is that the Cherokee perceived V. rotundifolia to grow under beech trees. This species is frequently found in rich wooded coves (Radford et al. 1968: 730), the same habitat that favors the growth of beech trees. It was used to treat fevers, but the modes of preparation and application were not included. tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl t\u00e1luwat\u00e9st - 'it grows in bunches, it grows around the white oak tree' - Elephantopus carolinianus Willd. The qualifier from tal\u00fb ('white oak') and uwat\u00e9st ('it grows around a tree') because the pl ant tends to grow under a white oak tree. A warm infusion of the bruised leaves was rubbed on sores caused by insects, as with the condition known as tckoya ('insects cause swelling in body'). A warm infusion of the whole plant was also rubbed on the forehead to relieve a headache and the swallowed juices of the chewed leaf were considered a strong remedy for severe coughs. t\u00fbks\u00fbn ul\u00eds - 'turnip's grandmother' - Lepidium t\u00fbks\u00fbna ('turnip') and ul\u00eds ('his maternal grandmother') and is used to describe this botanical species that is in the family Brassicaceae, the same family as turnips. Mooney menti oned two varieties, but only named this one. 276 Olbrechts glossed ul\u00eds as 'grandchild', which is a more accurate gloss according to Alexander (1971: 69), and used that name exclusively for L. virginicum . Mooney recorded two folk species of ul\u00eds, which may have been the two varieties of t\u00fbks\u00fbn ul\u00eds , but these will be discussed under the heading ul\u00eds below. The tender young greens and roots were eaten by the Cherokee and were r eputed to smell like turnips (Perry 1974: 37), suggesting the source for the name. t\u00fblagw egwa - no gloss, 'large' - Silphium compositum Michaux - rosinweed Mooney did not provide a gloss for the folk genus t\u00fblagw , but the specific qualifier egwa ('large') would indicate that there was at least one other folk species. No further information was available for the Cherokee use of t\u00fblagw egwa . t\u00fayast - Indian turnip, Jack-in- the-pulpit Mooney claimed the name was due to the bulbous corm, which is covered with a shriveled \"skin\" and resembles a boil or carbuncle. But the name may also be associated with its use. The dried root and a small quantity of walnut bark were pounded together and placed in the center of a boil (known as t\u00fast). Turpentine was gathered from pine trees and used as an oi ntment in conjunction with the pounded herbs. This was covered with cloth or paper until healed. The ointment was also used to heal a wound without leaving a scar. Banks added that the root was used as a poultice for headaches and the briefly roasted root, roll ed into balls the size of a small grape, 277 were eaten for kidney problems. The patient woul d eat 2, 3, 4, or 7 of the little balls (1953: 11). Although this plant is often referred to as a Native American edible plant, Witthoft claimed that the adjective \"Indian\" in the name Indian turnip was used to mean \"counterfeit\" or \"treacherous\". This was analogous to such terms as \"Indian giver\" or \"Indian summer\", and that the plant was considered poisonous when consumed (n.d.: 36). However, accounts from the early 19 th century reported that the roots were, \"boiled to remove the strong smart taste, and then mashed with the hands, & mixed, or kneaded like dough & baked or fried like other dough (Payne n.d. b: 268).\" The corms are high in calcium oxalate, an intensely irritating substance that can be removed through processing. However, drying may be the only effective way to eliminate enough of these crystals to provide a pal atable product (Peterson 1977: 156). tuyay\u00fast - 'like a bean' - Trifolium pratense L. - red clover The folk generic tuyay\u00fast is a composite of t\u00faya ('bean') and -iy\u00fast ('like') due to the resemblance of the plant to the bean pl ant. Mooney claimed that, in the case of T. pratense , it was due a resemblance to the peanut plant. It is not clear why this introduced species was considered prototypic al of the folk genus, but no qualifier was recorded by Mooney and he did not discuss the name. The same name was used for coffee, but was used to describe the bean and not the whole plant. The only medicinal use was recorded by Banks (1953: 74), who f ound that a tea of the plant was used for fevers. 278 tuyay\u00fast tsunsd\u00edga - 'like a bean, small' milk pea The specific qualifier tsunsd\u00edga ('small') indicates that there are other types of tuyay\u00fast, and, indeed, there are several that will be discussed below. The botanical species is probably misidentified as G. mollis is mostly found on the coastal plain (Radford et al. 1968: 642), but G. regularis and G. volubilis are both found in the mountains (Smith 1999: 28-29). No medi cinal properties were attributed \u00fatana - 'like a bean, large' - L. - butterfly pea The specific qualifier \u00fatana ('large') indicates that this was the largest of the tuyay\u00fast ('like a bean') and the flowers of C. mariana are among the largest of the family Fabaceae . The only medicinal application was recorded by Banks (1953: 70), who found that a tea of the roots was held in the mouth for 10 to 20 minutes to cure thrush in adults and infants. This was then followed by a mouthful of fresh tea. tuyay\u00fast uw\u00e1wat\u00e9na - 'like a bean, brushy or having leafy branches' - Desmodium rotundifolium D.C. - dollarleaf It is not clear why the specific qualifier uw\u00e1wat\u00e9na ('brushy' or 'having leafy branches') was associated with D. rotundifolium , as it has a prostrate habit and is not particularly brushy. He documented the common name as bush trefoil, so this may have been a misidentification. But this is one of several species of Desmodium that Mooney recorded and it is the only one that is a type of tuyay\u00fast, so it may be that its distinct 279 growth habit and leaf shape were distinguishing f eatures for its classification. No further information was available for this species. ud\u00e1tl - 'it is wedded' - Phoradendron leucarpum (Raf.) Reveal & M.C. Johnston - mistletoe The folk generic ud\u00e1tl ('it is wedded') was due to the parasitic nature of P. leucarpum . The new plant feeds on the host plant and becomes fused with it. Mooney said, \"The same expression is used of a married person.\" Banks found that a person with a headache would bathe their head with a tea of mistletoe and that a tea of mistletoe, drunk after four days of vomi ting, would cure L. - Indian cucumber Mooney recorded two other versions of the folk generic ugan\u00e1st ('sweet'), ugan\u00e1st\u00fb and the plural form \u00fanigan\u00e1st ('they are sweet'), which appears to refer to the edibility and pleasant flavor of the member s of this category. There were other synonyms for M. virginiana , man's first name is due to the small tuberous roots that were once boiled or roasted (Witthoft n.d.: 34), but neither Mooney nor Olbrechts prov ided an explanation for the second name. Mooney that unigan\u00e1st\u00fb an\u00ed lask was used by 'sweet small food' usd\u00edga and ag\u00edst ('food') were in reference to the edibility of S. amplexifolius and the related species Streptopus roseus Michaux. Later references refer exclusively to S . roseus , which was also referred to as bean salad. The young shoots were collected, boiled, and fried in gr ease (Witthoft 1977) or combined with other greens such as Polygonatum biflorum and Ligusticum canadense (Perry 1974: 48). White (1975) said that the cooked greens were reported to taste like green beans, hence the name bean salad, but he ident ified the botanical species as Disporum sessilifolia L. - wild oats Mooney did not provide a complete gloss for this folk variety and did not record any uses for it. However, Witthoft (1977) f ound that the greens of a related species, Uvularia perfoliata , were collected in the early spring, partially boiled, and fried in grease, suggesting that this might also have been considered an edible species. Banks found that the roots of U. sessilifolia were crushed and made into an infusion for diarrhea (1953: 19). ugan\u00e1st \u00fatana - 'sweet, large' - Polygonatum biflorum (Walter) Ell. - Solomon's seal This was the largest of the ugan\u00e1st and the most important food from this folk genus. The young shoots were eaten as greens while the root was pounded in a corn mortar and added to bread, possibly as a famine food (Witthoft n.d.: 28, Perry 1974: 47- 281 48, Banks 1953: 16). The roasted root was pounded and applied to boil-like swellings (Mooney 1891: 327) or made into a tea and drunk for stomach problems (Banks 1953: 16). The root of P. biflorum and some soil, procured from the front of a ground hog's den, were boiled and the decoction was drunk as a medium for emesis to clear \"spoiled saliva\" due to dreams of the dead. The pati ent would vomit until all the liquid was expelled, repeating the action for four stra ight mornings (Banks 1953: 16). Mooney also found that it was called ut\u00edstg or utstk ('hanging head'), most likely due to the fruits that hang below the arching stalk. Olbrechts recorded its use for a purple form of the cancerous condition known as adayeski ugatasig\u00edsk ('pus oozes out') was due to the profuse milky latex that was prevalent throughout thes e plants. The name stems from \u00faga ('pus'), which was closely related to \u00fagam\u00fb ('soup'), as ugatasig\u00edsk , the lack of a qualifier suggesting that it was the prototypical representative for the folk genus. Mooney also collected the synonyms ugatasig\u00edsk tl\u00e2gesh out, sinews'). A related which was also a type of ugatasig\u00edsk , has been discussed above (see kat\u00fblat\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga claimed that this was an \"impor tant medicine\", and it was one of twenty that he highlighted in his early work (1891: 325). The juicy latex was rubbed on eruptions on the head of children and the fi nely beaten root was used as a purgative 282 after a day of fasting. The juice was also rubbed to relieve sore nipples and was combined with other plants as a cancer remedy. Mooney also mentioned its use for gonorrhea, but his description was more el aborate in his notes. Mooney said the condition, was typified by white urine and was known as uhyet. A pint of the tea of the bruised root was drunk early in the mo rning and again before the evening meal. This was repeated two or three time, which was usually sufficient to elicit a cure. The same treatment was used for both sexes. Olbrec hts also found that it was used for the condition gayedi ('pain in the back'), which may have been a similar urinary tract infection. ugatasig\u00edsk dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb L. - panicled hawkweed Mooney only provided the Cherokee name and botanical species, but the qualifier dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk ('yellow-flowered') is true to botanical descriptions of the H. paniculatum (Radford et al. 1968: 1027) and many s pecies from the family Asteraceae are known to contain milky latex. ugatasig\u00edsk \u00fatana g\u00fbtl\u00fbt h - 'pus oozes out, large, dwelling on the hillside' - Amsonia tabernaemontana Walter - blue star Olbrechts only recorded the Cherokee and botanical names for this species, but it is in the family Apocynaceae, many member s of which are known to exhibit milky latex when damaged. 283 uguk\u00fask - 'owl's head' - Pedicularis canadensis hooting owl') and ('head'), due to the inflorescence. Mooney recorded two folk species, thes variants one botanical species (Radford et al. 1968: 962). Mooney found that the roots were used in conjunction with the whole plant of Scutellaria lateriflora and the roots of an unidentified plant called watulis ('honey' or 'bee') to reduce the fever and spasms of a woman who had recently delivered a baby. The tea was drunk throughout the day \"for some time\". Pedicularis canadensis was found on mountainsides and recognized in wi nter by a few persistent green leaves. Olbrechts added that a decoction of the r oots was used on sores. Banks (1953: 117) found that a decoction of the roots was used for stomach problems, an infusion of the roots relieved flux, and it was an ingredient in a mixture used for coughs. ugwau stalyato - 'the leaves have split themselves' - Ambrosia L. - ragweed Olbrechts did not explain the etymol ogy for this name, but his gloss of ugwau appears to be incorrect, as it is the singular form. However, the Cherokee name is quite descriptive of the deeply dissected leaves of A. artemisifolia . He provided the only uses attributed to this species, finding it used for antasgiski tskoya ('insects are breaking out') and the half-roasted leaves were rubbed on cases of poison ivy. He also said it may have been used for snakebites, but he did not know which parts of the plant were 284 used or how it was prepared and applied. Banks recorded some general uses for the genus Ambrosia , but these have already been discussed (see iyuga egwa above). uhy\u00fbst - 'bitter' - smartweed The folk generic uhy\u00fbst ('bitter') was mentioned above in the plural form tsunihy\u00fbst ('they are bitter'), but this appears to be a whole different category of plants. The inherent organoleptic quality of the genus Polygonum is considered to be more acrid/peppery than bitter (Peterson 1977: 116), hence the common name smartweed. This may indicate that the Cherokee concept of uhy\u00fbst had a broader range of quality than our current concepts of bitter. Mooney found that the plant was pounded and placed in pools to poison fish, but Banks said it was no longer used as of the early 1950s. However, he did find that the plant was crushed or cooked up and used as a liniment for bruises or painful joints and the peppery/acrid nature of the plant was employed to prevent thumb sucking by children (1953: 39). uhy\u00fbst un\u00e9ga adsil\u00fbsk L. - pink smartweed It is not clear why this was considered the 'white-flowered' species of uhy\u00fbst. As the common name suggests, the flowers are predominantly pink. However, there are rare white individuals (Radford et al. 1968: 420) and this may have been an on-the-spot naming of P. pensylvanicum . Little else is known about the Cherokee relationship with this species. 285 uiyatati - no gloss - Erigeron pulchellus Michaux - robin's plantain Olbrechts did not provide a gloss for uiyatati; however, he did record two synonyms, uwat\u00e9st ('it grows around a tree') and tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl t\u00e1luwat\u00e9st ('it grows in bunches, it grows around the white oak tree' ). These were the same names Mooney recorded for Elephantopus carolinianus (see tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl t\u00e1luwat\u00e9st above). This could indicate misidentification on the part of one of these men or a case of underdifferentiation by the Cherokee, but wit hout voucher specimens from both men we can not know for sure. To add to the uncertainty, Olbrechts recorded that leaves and roots of E. pulchellus were made into an infusion and sprinkled on swollen insect bites, one of the primary uses that Mooney recorded for Elephantopus carolinianus . uktan\u00e9ga ud\u00e2 it' - Phryma leptostachya L. - lop-seed The Cherokee uktan\u00e9ga ud\u00e2 stems from uktan\u00e9ga ('bran') and ud\u00e2 ('it has something hanging from it), a form of ugwad\u00e2\u00fb ('I have something long hanging from me'). It and the common name l op-seed are both descriptive of the flowers, which open in opposing pairs and droop on the stem soon after opening. Banks (1953: 119) found that the roots were used in a formula to attract the object of one's affections, the paired flowers and seeds bei ng symbolic of the intended union. However, the Cherokee name that he recorded, tciskwa dunotcilu gi ('the bird with the protruding chest'), is the same name that Olbrechts recorded for Perilla frutescens (see above). 286 \u00fbl uglt 'it Britt. - Bowman's stems from \u00fbl ('locust') and uglt ('it trees it'), a form of akw'glt ('I have it treed'). It was due to the per ception that the locust preferred to emerge from the ground under the shade of P. trifoliatus . The earliest reference to this plant may have come from Palisot de Beauvois in the late 18 th century. He found that the plant was used as a purgative and emetic to augment the treatment for snakebites (Anderson 1984). Mooney found mixed responses for the application of this plant. Two informants said that a decoction of the root was used for bowel complaints accompanied by fever and the vomiting of bile. Another said it was too toxic to take internally but the pounded root was used as a poultice on swellings (1891: 326). Olbrechts found that P. trifolia tus was one of several plants used in a formula for scratching with a snake's tooth. This was done before ballgames and in cases of rheumatism or listlessness. Along with the roots of P. trifoliatus , the mixture could include the leaves of , Rhododendron maximum , roots of Veratrum viride . This was considered very potent, irritating medicine and patients could rarely stand a series of four applications (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 203-204). Will West Long claimed that this was considered a female contraceptive, an infusion of the roots causing per manent sterility. A cold infusi on of the root or the juice of the chewed root was used to alleviate insect bites and bee stings, while the pounded root was placed on an aching tooth (Banks 1953: 62). A strong infusion or decoction of the whole plant was once used as an emetic (Witthoft 1947). 287 ulid\u00e1st usd\u00ed-ga pachypoda eyes, white folk generic ulid\u00e1st ('it deceives') stems from ts\u00edlidast\u00fb ('I cause him to make a mistake' or 'I am deceiving him' ). It was so called because the young plant resembles and was confused with ginseng and angelica, both of which were highly esteemed and sought after by the Cherokee. Ol brechts was told that the foliage turns yellow in the fall, just like that of gi nseng, distracting the ginseng hunter. Mooney also collected two possible synonyms, ulid\u00e1st unega ('it deceives, white'), due to the white berries, and ulid\u00e1st at\u00fblah ('it deceives, growing in the low plain'), ('low plain') and h ('dwelling' or 'living'). Olbrechts A. pachypoda was used alone for didanikwutisgi ('rheumatism in the kneecaps') and as part of a formula for unawasti ('he gets cold' or 'that which chills one'). Banks added that a decoction of the roots was used for the condition called tckoya ('insects cause swelling in body') and that the plant was thought to destroy the teeth of young people (1953: 43). One of Witthoft's informants elaborated on this latter belief, stating that merely handli ng the leaves or root would transfer some sap onto the hands of the person. This woul d eventually get into their food and \"cause the teeth to rot and crumble away in a matter of three to four years (n.d. 61).\" ulid\u00e1st \u00fatana - 'it deceives, large' - Cimicifuga Nutt. - black cohosh This was the 'large' folk species of ulid\u00e1st, reaching a height of as much as 2.5 meters tall. Mooney found that the pounded r oots were made into a warm decoction with those drunk for fevers and Olbrechts found that it was part of the formula with Actaea pachypoda for unawasti ('he gets cold' or 'that which chills one'). The roots may have been soaked in alcohol and the extract used for rheumatism (Witthoft 1947), but this form of herbal preparation was not common with the Cherokee. ul\u00eds usd\u00ed-ga - 'grandchild, small' - Lepidium virginicum L. - peppergrass The folk is a version of t\u00fbks\u00fbn ul\u00eds ('turnip's grandmother' or 'turnip's grandchild') and highlights the ived relationship of edible members of the family Brassicaceae to the turnip. Lepidium virginicum was discussed above under heading. 'grandchild, large' - Sisymbrium officinale (L.) Scopoli - hedge mustard This introduced species became the 'large' folk species of ul\u00eds. A common weed in disturbed areas, it was used as an edible green (Banks 1953: 55). ul\u00eds \u00fatana cress, greens This varietal qualifier dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk was due to the yellow flowers that appeared in warm weather. Both of these introduced species were collected and eaten as the earliest green vegetables of the seas on in the Cherokee diet (Witthoft 1977). The leaves, either eaten alone or mixed with other early spring greens, were parboiled and fried in grease (Perry 1974: 36) or eaten raw with some salt (Witthoft n.d.: 26). 289 Secondary sources suggest that the Cherok ee considered creasy greens to be a blood cleanser (Duke 1992: 46, Moerman 1998: 121) , but the primary source or this information, Hamel and Chiltoskey's Cherokee Plants, Their Uses - A 400 Year History (1975), is not referenced and the original source is unclear. un\u00e1stets g\u00fbnah\u00edta - 'long root' - Solidago from un\u00e1stets ('root') and g\u00fbnah\u00edta ('long'), which apparently referred to the extensive roots system of S. caesia . The botanical species is in question for this folk genus. Olbrechts identified it as S. caesia , but Mooney had two potential botanical names for un\u00e1stets g\u00fbnah\u00edta . One specimen had no flowers and he tentatively identified it as S. caesia (Ms. 2235). But a plant label that was associated with the folk generic un\u00e1stets g\u00fbnah\u00edta was identified as Aster infirmus Michaux, and the note on the label indicated that it wa s a common white-flowered species (Ms. 2497). This would differentiate it from the yellow-flowered S. caesia . The medicinal application does not hel p clarify the botanical uncertainty. Olbrechts found that the chewed root of un\u00e1stets g\u00fbnah\u00edta was blown up the nostrils of a hunting dog that had become lazy from exce ssive hunting or eating food prepared by a menstruating woman. The treatment caus ed excess \"bad slime\" to be expelled from the dog's nose. A similar application, removing excess mucus from humans, was ascribed to Aster infirmus (see natsiy\u00fast gatush in intermediate categories), but no species of Solidago were reported used for such condi tions. It was also combined with serpentaria L. - Virginia snakeroot The name was a composite of un\u00e1stets ('root') and usd\u00edy, the intensive form of usd\u00ed or usd\u00edga ('small'), and was due to the diminutive root of A. serpentaria . Mooney found that the Cherokee, as the common name might suggest, used the root as a remedy for snakebites. A decoction of the root was blown on the patient and the juice created from chewing the root was rubbed on the site of the bite. The decoction was also drunk for fevers and associated headaches, as well as for coughs. The bruised root was placed against an aching tooth or placed in the hollow area of a decayed tooth, as well as rubbed on a nose that had been irritated by constant wiping during a cold (Mooney 1891 324). Olbrechts claimed that A. serpentaria was an alternative medicine to treat dreams of snakebites. When the fern Botrychium virginianum was not available, the medicine man would chew a piece of the root of A. serpentaria and blows it on the place that had been bitten in the dream (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 177). He also found that it was used for aninedzi gotiski in their breast'), and tsidunitsile\u00e7a ('when they have itching'). This last condition was for itchy genitals due to urinating on the hot ashes remaining from a fire, and A. serpentaria was mentioned as the primary remedy for this condition (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 286). Banks added that a decoction of the roots was used for stomachaches, fevers, headaches, and heart trouble. The roots could also be made into a cold infusion or simply chewed and the juice swallowed for colds. In case of an accident, like getting cut 291 with an axe, a cold infusion was used to alleviate pain and prevent the patient from fainting (1953: 37-38). unatl\u00e2st - no gloss - Amianthium muscaetoxicum (Walter) Gray - fly poison, crow poison Neither Mooney nor Olbrechts provided a gloss for this folk genus; however, Olbrechts did record the synonym glossed as 'they are that there \u00fatana and small ( usd\u00ed-ga ) folk species of unatl\u00e2st, but did not match either with a botanica l species. Olbrechts found that it was used in a formula with Veratrum viride , Aralia spinosa , and an unidentified species for \"they are cutting it up\", a form of r heumatism. Witthoft (1947) reported that A. muscaetoxicum was once used as a poison for crows (hence the common name \"crow poison\") and as, \"a sure, but severe cure for the itch (scabies).\" unatl\u00fbtaliy\u00fast - 'like they are upright against or supported by something' - Thermopsis villosa (Walter) Fernald and Schubert - hairy bush pea The name stems from unatl\u00fbtal ('they are upright against or supported by something'), a synonym for Pisum sativum L. or the garden pea (see t\u00faya usd\u00edga in Part 2), and -iy\u00fast ('like'). This would indicate the Cherokee perception that T. villosa was similar to but a distinctively different kind of plant than P. sativum . No further information is available concerning the Cherokee relationship to this plant. 292 \u00fanatl\u00fbnw\u00e9hitu - 'having spirals' - Spiranthes cernua (L.) ladies' tresses Mooney placed a question mark next to the botanical species in his notes and did not identify the species in his published ma terials (1900: 427), but from the Cherokee name \u00fanatl\u00fbnw\u00e9hitu ('having spirals'), it is likely that he was correct about the generic designation. One of the identifyi ng characteristics of the genus Spiranthes is the spiral arrangement of the inflorescence (Radford et al. 1968: 346). The root was used, \"in conjurations designed to predispose strangers in favor of the subject.\" The medicine man would chew a small piece of the root and blow or rub the juice on the body and arm of one who was preparing to travel and persuade others of the worthiness of his cause. This was done in hopes that all he met would find his bearing and appearance appealing, and would be inclined to support hi s goals (1900: 427). Banks mentions the use of Spiranthes lucida (H. H. Eaton) Ames, but this species is not known to the Southern Appalachian region and it was most likely S. cernua . He found that a warm tea was used to wash infants and insure their healthy growth and that it was used with Liparis loeselii (L.) Richard for painful urination (1953: 23). un\u00e2y\u00fbli - 'they (berries) are attached to leaf stalk' - Triosteum perfoliatum L. - horse gentian The name un\u00e2y\u00fbli ('they (berries) are attached to leaf stalk') was due to the sessile berries that grew in the axils of the leaves. Mooney also collected the synonym tsusalt (see g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush in Part 1), which had to do with the perfoliate leaves. 293 Olbrechts, who recorded the common name as wild coffee, found that a tea was made from the roots and applied to swollen insect bites. uned\u00e2ita uniskwalatisgu - no gloss - Spiranthes gracilis (Bigelow) Beck - slender ladies' tresses Mooney only provided the Cherokee name and botanical species for this plant (Ms. 2235). No further information is avail able concerning the Cherokee relationship to this plant. unstal un\u00fbs\u00fbt - 'it has ice on its leg' - Oligoneuron rigidum (L.) Small var. rigidum - The name stems from unstal ('ice') and un\u00fbs\u00fbt ('it has it on its leg') because frost tends to gather on the stalk in late fall. The synonym ukan\u00e1w ('tallow') was related to this because the ice often looked white li ke tallow. A tea made from the roots was drunk for four days to treat listlessness. This was followed by a tea of Sambucus canadensis , which acted as an make L. - seedbox The name \u00faninay\u00fbg was due to the rattling of the dried seed capsules and was also the same name used for ceremoni al rattles. It was also a synonym for Dioscorea villosa (see aniskutataski (uwetige adsil\u00fb sk) in Part 1). No medicinal qualities were attributed to L. alternifolia . 294 unisk-h - 'it has heads' - Echium - viper's bugloss The name from un\u00edska , the plural form of \u00faska ('head'), due to the numerous white seeds. These seeds played a vital role in Cherokee diagnostic practices, as they were the precursors to the beads used by medicine men to divine the outcome of a therapy (Mooney 1900: 426). M ooney found that a tea of the roots was considered an effective remedy for gonorrhea. It was usually drunk for four days, but could elicit a cure in one day (Ms. 1894). Ol brechts found that it was used for a related condition, uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white'), dunikstisg\u00f6i ('when they vomit'). - L. - whorled milkweed Mooney was unsure why this was a type of unisk-h, but it was designated the 'small' folk species to distinguish it from Asclepias tubero sa (see gug above), which sometimes went by the synonym unisk-h ts\u00fantana ('it has heads, large'). No medicinal uses were attributed to A. verticillata . uniskwet\u00fa g tsund\u00ed-ga - 'they wear a hat or they have their heads covered, small' - Podophyllum peltatum L. - may-apple The folk generic uniskwet\u00fa g ('they wear a hat') is a form of \u00e1gw\u00fblskwetg\u00fb ('I am wearing a hat'), and is due to the umbr ella-like appearance of the leaves. Both Mooney and Olbrechts recorded its use for chronic dal\u00e2ni , but Mooney gave the best description for its use. The roots of P. peltatum were combined with the bark of black walnut and that of butternut and made into a strong decoction. This was boiled down 295 four times until it became a thick syrup. A bout a half a teacup full was drunk one time as a powerful cathartic. The patient would re cover at once unless a menstruating woman entered the room, then they would swell up and die. Olbrechts also found it was useful for unisikwask\u00f6 ('when they are coughing') and a stomach-ache with swollen and throbbing stomach'). Banks found that the dried powdered roots or a tea of the roots were used as a laxative and the roots were soaked in whiskey and taken for rheumatism. The pounded roots were also soaked in water and corn seed was soaked in the resulting tea to keep pests from eating the freshly planted corn. Some informants warned that the only the portion of the root between the nodes wa s used, the nodes themselves being too poisonous (1953: 48). In fact, Witthoft found that the nodes were used specifically to poison crows and dogs (n.d.: 39). He also added that a drop of the juice of root was placed in the ear to cure deafness (Witthoft 1947). The fruits of mayapple are considered edible, but Witthoft found that the more conservative Cherokees would avoid the plant completely, believing that any vi ne plants in their garden would whither and die if they tended them after eating the fruit (n.d.: 38). uniskwet\u00fa g ts\u00fantana - ''they wear a hat or they have their heads covered, large' - Diphylleia cymosa Michaux - umbrella-leaf This was the 'large' species of uniskwet\u00fa g, and the leaves are large, some up to a half a meter wide (Radford et al. 1968: 471). No medicinal uses for D. cymosa were attributed to the Cherokee. 296 un\u00fbguhist - 'they leak' - Physalis angulata L. - ground cherry The folk generic un\u00fbguhist stems from g\u00fbg\u00fast\u00fb ('it is leaking'), a term used to describe meal, wheat, or a liquid. This most li kely referred to the seeds that would \"leak\" from the ripe fruit. Mooney also recorded the synonym anah\u00e2sk ('they drop off'), stemming from gah\u00e2sk\u00fb ('it is dropping off', referring to round objects). This was because the fruit dropped off when it was ripe. The berries of this and other species of Physalis were eaten fresh when they turned yellow (Witthoft n.d.: 39, Perry 1974: 55). un\u00fbguhist L. or Physalis heterophylla Nees. - ground cherry Both botanical species here have varying degrees of pubescence, hence the specific qualifier unikwtay\u00fawani anitawisgage (Ms. 1894) for P. pubescens , but did not provide a gloss for either specific qualifier. He claimed the edible fruit had yellow seeds and was sweet when ripe. un\u00fbguh\u00edstiyust - 'like they leak' - bittersweet nightshade; Solanum carolinense L. - horse nettle The folk genus un\u00fbguh\u00edstiyust was a composite of un\u00fbguhist ('they leak') and - iy\u00fast ('like'), referring to the similarity of the fruit to the ground cherry. This is one of the few instances of underdifferentiation appar ent in the Cherokee ethnobotanical system. Solanum carolinense has already been discussed above (see did\u00e1wahist\u00edsk ). No medicinal applications were attributed to S. dulcamara or N. physalodes . However, 297 Witthoft did mention that the Cherokee were careful to point out the differences between these two toxic species and the edible members of Physalis , especially to novices and children (n.d.: 40). He also found that the leaves of N. physalodes were crushed in water with a sweet, sticky substance and left out as a poisonous trap to control flies (n.d.: 62). uskwayeluyi - no gloss - var. perfoliata - Venus' looking-glass Olbrechts provided no gloss for this Cher okee folk generic, but he did find that it was used to treat unitseno iseoi ('when a person has - spotted wintergreen, pipsissewa The name stems from the resemblance of the leaves to the American holly, Ilex opaca , known to the Cherokee as \u00fastst ('he spins'). But its diminutive size makes it the 'small' kind. Banks provided the majority of the uses for C. maculata , finding that a root tea was used for colds, flu, and fever, the beaten roots were used as a poultice for headaches and other pain, and it was made into a tea for menstrual pain (1953: 97). Mooney may have been referring to C. maculata when he noted the use of a plant he called utast ust\u00ed, which he described as an evergreen t hat grew in the mountains. The pounded leaves were wrapped in a cloth and soaked in water. The water was then used to bathe the eyes of a patient whose eyes were sore and they could not look at the sun. 298 \u00fbtsat uskw\u00e2l usd\u00ed-ga - 'fish bladder, uskw\u00e2l \u00fatana - 'fish bladder, large' - no botanical species The folk generic stems from \u00fbtsat ('fish') and uskw\u00e2l ('bladder' or 'stomach') due to the resemblance of the seed capsule to a fish bladder. Mooney recorded two folk species, but was not able to identify the botanical species associated with the names. He did record the name \u00fbtsat uskw\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like fish bladder') for Sabatia angularis (see sk\u00e1y't above), suggesting that the capsules of the two species of \u00fbtsat uskw\u00e2l resembled those of S. angularis . No medicinal qualities were associated with either species. uwadsska usd\u00ed-ga - 'small fish Boivin - windflower, rue anemone folk generic stems from \u00fbtsat ('fish') and uwadsska ('scales'), referring to the resemblance of the leaves to fish scales. Thalictrum thalictroides was considered the 'small' species of \u00fbtsat uwadsska. A decoction of Aquilegia canadensis , was considered the 'large' species of \u00fbtsat uwadsska and the leaflets are generally larger than those of Thalictrum thalictroides . Mooney also recorded a shortened version for the generic name, uwasdskln\u00fb ('scale', implying one attached to the body of a fish). Its use for diarrhea was mentioned in the previous 299 entry, but Mooney elaborated on this in other parts of his notes (Ms. 1894). The root was boiled and the decoction drunk every hour to combat diarrhea with associated vomiting. Mooney also noted that it was standar d practice to drink a medicinal tea once a day or at one hour intervals. \u00fbtsat uwadsska unikwtay\u00fawani - 'fish scales, qualifier unikwtay\u00fawani ('downy') was due to the pubescent leaves. However, it is not clear why this was a type of \u00fbtsat uwadsska, as the leaves of Hieracium gronovii do not resemble either of the previous types of \u00fbtsat uwadsska. Olbrechts found that this plant was once used for medicine, but the use was forgotten at the time of his research. \u00fbtsat uwadsskiy\u00fast - 'like bower Mooney recorded C. virginiana as the species known to be 'like' the two previous species, but it is not clear why, as the trifol iate leaves are distinctly different from those of the two previous species. It will be discussed in the chapter on vines (see igag\u00fbt) and is only mentioned here for continuity with Thalictrum thalictroides and Aquilegia canadensis . uwesk\u00e2y - 'curving' (like a rooster's tail) - no botanical species The name is due to the white flowers that curve over like the tail of a rooster. Unfortunately, Mooney often conflated the meaning of the terms \"flower\" and 300 \"inflorescence\", so it is not clear what is curving. Will West Long noted that this was a fall/winter plant and the leaves rema ined green in winter. Mooney questioningly suggested that this might be \"star grass\", a common name for Aletris farinosa L. But it could also be Chamaelirium luteum (L.) Willd., which was known as blazing star or devil's bit and has an inflorescence that tends to droop and could be said to resemble a rooster's tail. Both are noted medicinal pl ants from the North Carolina mountains and the basal rosettes remain green in winter, but neither is mentioned in the literature concerning Cherokee medicine. No medi cinal qualities were attributed to uwesk\u00e2y. uy\u00e1tl\u00fb g\u00fbnatl\u00e1 - 'tame or cultivated it makes a ridge' - Acorus calamus L. - sweet flag The generic uy\u00e1tl\u00fb ('it makes a ridge') was due to the habit of the rhizome of A. calamus to make a ridge in the earth. The specific qualifier g\u00fbnath\u00e1 ('tame' or 'cultivated') would suggest that this pl ant was transplanted and treated with care. Mooney and Olbrechts both recorded this plant as simply uy\u00e1tl, but Olbrechts added several Mooney's informants called it uy\u00e1tl inagh ('it makes a ridge, growing in the wilderness'). Mooney found that an infusion made by pouring hot water on the bruised root was rubbed on areas of the body affected by rheumatism, the root being found in the river bottoms and dried for future use (Ms. 1894). The root was also chewed at dances to keep the singers from getting hoarse (M s. 3462). Olbrechts found it they are coughing'), and for fever accompanied by thirst. A hot 301 infusion of the root or the chewed root wa s used as a cold remedy and the chewed root was also used for headaches and sore throats (Banks 1953: 11). uy\u00e1tl usd\u00ed-ga - 'it makes a ridge, small' - Iris cristata Aiton - dwarf crested iris uy\u00e1tl usd\u00ed-ga gatus h - 'it makes a ridge, small', mountain dwelling' - Iris verna L. - dwarf iris These were considered the 'small' species of uy\u00e1tl, and, as the common names indicates, they are small species of Iris. Both species were discussed above under the heading tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl inagh. This creates a problem with the glosses for uy\u00e1tl and tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl. The latter is obviously a plural form of the former, but Mooney glossed uy\u00e1tl as 'it makes a ridge' and tsuy\u00e1t\u00fbl as 'it grows in bunches'. Perhaps the Cherokee terms have a flexible meaning that encompasses both concepts or there are subtle variations in the terms that change the meaning, but Mooney did not clarify this point. uy\u00e1tl \u00fatana - 'it makes a ridge, large' - Iris virginica L. - blue flag This was considered the 'large' species of uy\u00e1tl and it is the tallest species of Iris in the Southern Appalachian region (Smith 1999: 19). No medicinal qualities were attributed to I. virginica . uy\u00e1tliy\u00fast - 'like it makes a ridge' - no botanical species Mooney noted that there was a plant that was known as being 'like' uy\u00e1tl , but he was unable to identify it. No further inform ation is available concerning this plant. 302 uy\u00fbgl - senega snakeroot - Polygala senega L. The folk generic uy\u00fbgl appears to be an opaque, proper name for Seneca snakeroot. Adair reported the first indica tion of its use by the Cherokee in 1775: I do not remember to have seen or heard of an Indian dying by the bite of a snake, when out at war, or a hunting; although they are then often bitten by the most dangerous of snakes - every one carries in his shot-pouch, a piece of the best snake-root, such as the Seneeka, or fern-snake-root, - or the wild hore-hound, wild plantain, St. Andrew's cross, and a variety of other herbs and roots, which are plenty, and well known to those who range the American woods, and are exposed to such dangers, and will effect a thorough and speedy cure if timely applied. When an Indian perceives he is struck by a snake, he immediately chews some of the root, and having swallowed a sufficient quantity of it, he applies some to the wound; which he repeats as occasion requires, and in proportion to the poison the snake has infused into the wound. For a short space of time, there is a terrible conflict th roughout all the body, by the jarring qualities of the burning poison, and the strong anti dote; but the poison is soon repelled through the same channels it entered, and the patient is cured (Adair 1974: 247- 248). However, Mooney claimed that the Cherokee did not use P. senega for snakebites, but for other unspecified illnesse s. He did mention that the plant was an important part of their local economy and they sold the roots to white traders for $.50 a 303 pound green and $2.00 to $3.00 a pound dried. Th is was a substantial amount of money in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As late as 1948 the price for dried senega snakeroot was only $.60 a pound (Cozzo 1999: 171). Perhaps its financial value superceded its reputation as a medicinal product. uy\u00fbgliy\u00fast usd\u00ed-ga - 'like whorled milkwort The folk genus uy\u00fbgliy\u00fast was based on the resemblance of certain plants to uy\u00fbgl or P. senega . This was the 'small' species of uy\u00fbgliy\u00fast. No medicinal applications were attributed considered the 'large' species of uy\u00fbgliy\u00fast. A warm infusion of the whole plant was used to treat dysentery in weaning children. The roots or the whole plant were also burned and the ashes were mixed with old bear's grease. The resulting salve was applied to old sores that would not heal. The plant was dried for use at a later time. uyul usd\u00ed-ga - 'it is a sprout, small' L. - soapwort, bouncing bet Mooney glossed the folk genus uyul as both 'it is a sprout' and 'it is only stuck on', which stemmed from uwa\u00edy-itl\u00fb ('a sprout or sucker from a stump or graft'). He said that the name implied that the stalk was loos ely fit on the plant, but familiarity with the 304 plant leads me to believe that it had more to do with the aggressive side shoots that grow when the plant is topped. No m edicinal qualities were attributed to S. officinalis . uyul \u00fatana - 'it is a sprout, large' - no botanical species This was the 'large' species of uyul. Mooney did not identify the botanical species, but he did describe it as having yellow flowers, being about 4 feet tall, and growing in the high mountains. No m edicinal qualities were attributed to ('cow tongue') was in reference to the leaves, which were thought to resemble the tongue of a cow. No medicinal qualities were attributed to w\u00e1ka g\u00e1nka. wal\u00e2s- Nicholson - yellow mandarin In his published materials, Mooney said that this name referred to a myth about a duel between two frogs who used the stalks of this plant as weapons (Mooney 1900: 421). But in his notes he attributes another explanation of the name to Will West Long. The fight was between a frog and a ratsnake, and when the snake bit the frog he would run to this plant. When the plant was remov ed, the frog died from the bite. White (1975) identified D. lanuginosum as and edible green used by the Cherokee (see ugan\u00e1st usd\u00edga ag\u00edst above). 305 wal\u00e2s- (L.) Desf. - false Solomon's seal Olbrechts recorded this name without a gl oss, but it is obviously the 'large' variety of wal\u00e2s- un\u00fblsti ('it fights frogs'). He said it was used for a condition he simply referred to as \"heat\". Banks said that a cold infusion of the roots was used to bathe sore eyes (1953: 17). While there is no record of its use for food by the Cherokee, it is a known edible plant (Peterson 1977: 52) and the young shoots were probably gathered along with those of Polygonatum biflorum (see ugan\u00e1st \u00fatana above). The plants emerge around the same time and the young s hoots are nearly indistinguishable from each other. wal\u00e9lu un\u00edtsil wal\u00e9lu ('hummingbird') and un\u00edtsilg\u00edst a composite uds\u00edla or udsil\u00fb ('blossom') and ast\u00fb ('it is sucking'). Money identified the botanical species associated with wal\u00e9lu un\u00edtsilg\u00edst as I. pallida , while Olbrechts identified it as I. capensis . The two species are nearly identical, the differences being in flow er color and slight variation in flower morphology. Banks claimed that most Cherok ee considered them the same plant (1953: 84). Mooney found that a poultice of the r oots and lower stem was used to treat dislocations or broken limbs and that it was used to treat swelling and pain in the abdomen from adding new foods to the diet (see ts\u00edts above). The stems were part of a 306 tea drunk by pregnant women. The inclusi on in the formula was due to the ripe seed pods that explode when they are touched. Th is would frighten the child and encourage it \"to jump down\" quickly at birth (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 119). It was also used for difficult births, the vaginal area bei ng washed with a warm decoction of wal\u00e9lu un\u00edtsilg\u00edst (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 125). In his notes, Olbrechts added that the leaves were mixed with those of unident ified plants and made into a tea to bathe children with chronic diarrhea caused by the father's infidelity before birth. Banks (1953: 84) added that the leaves were rubbed on areas infected with poison oak and a tea of the leaves was used for measles. The roots were made into a tea and drunk for \"bold hives\", a serious conditi on that afflicts infants shortly after their birth (see \u00e2tal-g\u00fbl above). w\u00e1liwal appears to be an opaque, proper name. The botanical species included in this folk genus are prostrate plants with succulent leaves and stems. Sedum ternatum was the 'small' folk of the synonym w\u00e1liwal nuny\u00e2hi- h ('rock dwelling w\u00e1liwal) because the plant is frequently found growing on rock outcrops. Olbrechts found that it was par t of the formula that was used to rub on ball player's legs before a match, t he only recorded medicinal application for S. ternatum . 307 w\u00e1liwal the synonym w\u00e1liwal tl\u00e2gesh ('w\u00e1liwal growing fields'), a common habitat for P. oleracea . Mooney found that the red stems of P. oleracea were combined with the roots of Cypripedium spp . for intestinal worms. This was in part because the stems resembled worms, but the seeds have been used as an anthelminthic by other Native American groups and in India (Simopoul os et al. 1995). Although it is known in many parts of the world as a palatable potherb, Witthoft (1977) claimed that the Cherokee did not use it as such. waliw\u00e1liy\u00fast - 'like w\u00e1liwal' - Rumex acetosella L. - sheep-sorrel Mooney did not explain the relationshi p of this plant to the species of w\u00e1liwal. However, the name indicates that it was perceived to be similar to w\u00e1liwal, possibly due to its red stalks or fleshy leaves. Banks ( 9153: 39) found that the leaves were used as a poultice on old sores and Perry (1974: 53) found that the leaves were known to be edible. wan\u00e9git - angelico - Ligusticum canadense (L.) Britton The folk generic wan\u00e9git appears to be a proper, opaque name for angelico. There is some confusion over the members of this folk genus. Mooney recorded two folk species, wan\u00e9git usd\u00ed-ga ('small') and wan\u00e9git \u00fatana ('large'), but indicated that they were two species of Angelica . The two species of Angelica common to the region are Angelica venenosa (Greenway) Fernald, a relatively small species, and A. triquinata 308 Michaux, a substantially more robust species. However, L. canadense and A. venenosa are morphologically very similar and it has taken several encounters for me to readily distinguish between the two. But Mooney identified A. venenosa by the Cherokee names gan\u00e9lta ('pregnant') and kanas\u00e2liy\u00fast ('like kanas\u00e2la') (see above), so in this instance it may be that the 'small' species was L. canadense and the 'large' species was A. triquinata . Without voucher specimens, it may be impossible to sort this out. The primary use for wan\u00e9git was as a potherb. Mooney said the young stalks were harvested when the leaves first appeared. They were boiled in hot water, rinsed off, and cooked, presumably in hot grease and often mixed with some species of ugan\u00e1st (see above). Witthoft found that the leaves were eaten in some Cherokee households, but not by the local mountain whit es (n.d.: 30). Perry (1974: 58) found that the greens were mixed with some of the sweeter greens, but it was often eaten alone because, \"it's too good for mixing\". The prim ary mode of preparation was to parboil the greens and fry them in grease, but they were also hung up and dried or blanched and canned. Will West Long told Mooney that t he greens of both the 'large' and 'small' species were eaten and tasted \"like parsnip r oots\", indicating that the greens of the species of Angelica were included in this edible complex. wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast - 'like wan\u00e9git' - Pastinaca folk generic wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast ('like wan\u00e9git') was indicative of the similarity of P. sativa to L. canadensis or the species of Angelica . The similarity may have been morphological, but Will West Long told Mooney that the cooked roots of the parsnip tasted like wan\u00e9git greens, so the relationship may have been due to the similar 309 flavors. The \"wild parsnip\" referred to in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (Mooney 1891: 369) and The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney 104) was most likely Cicuta maculata , a deadly poisonous plant that must not be confused with the naturalized P. sativa that escaped from cultivation (see kanas\u00e2la 'like L. - wild sarsaparilla Mooney did not explain the gloss for wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast \u00fbnag\u00e9, but it was most likely the 'black' species of wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast because of the dark color of the fruit. It is morphologically similar to Ligusticum canadense , which most likely explains its inclusion in the folk genus wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast . Banks recorded the only medicinal application for A. nudicaulis , finding that a tea of the roots was considered a good blood tonic (1953: 91). wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast to Ligusticum canadense inclusion in the folk genus wan\u00e9gitiy\u00fast . The 'blue' represented by the specific qualifier sak\u00e1nige was most likely due to the perceived color of the plant, which is also the reason for the common name. The medicinal qualities have already been discussed above (see kan\u00e1stgw\u00e2l). watsk or watsk\u00fb - amaranth - Amaranthus pigweed Watsk appears to be an opaque, proper name for the genus Amaranthus . The species A. retroflexus was the prototypical member of this folk genus, recorded without 310 a specific qualifier. Witthoft found that t he young plants were used as an early spring potherb (n.d.: 27). Will West Long also included A. retroflexus in his list of plants that could be used in the medicinal concoction drunk in the later versions of the Green Corn Ceremony (Witthoft 1946). watsk g\u00fbnatl\u00e1 gigage pigweed The qualifier g\u00fbnatl\u00e1 indicates that there were species of Amaranthus that were nurtured in Cherokee gardens when Mooney did his field research. While Mooney identified A. hybridus as the 'red' variety, Witthoft speculated that this may have actually been the 'white' variety (see below) due to its white rootstock. 'white' variety of watsk g\u00fbnatl\u00e1, so Witthoft's speculation is the best evidence availabl e for the identity of this species. wesu un\u00edgist - 'cat foods' - Nepeta name stems from wesu ('cat') and un\u00edgist, the plural form of ag\u00edst ('food'), due to the fondness of the domestic cat for the plant (Olbrechts). Olbrechts found that a decoction of the leaves was drunk for fever, colds, chill, and sore throats. Banks found similar applications, and added that the tea pr omoted sweating as well as the relieving an upset stomach and the leaves were used as a poultice for boils (1953: 111). 311 y\u00e2na - name stems from y\u00e2na ('bear') and un\u00edgist, the plural form of ag\u00edst ('food'), but it is unclear which part of the pl ant was eaten by bears. It may have been the berries, as the plant was sometimes called ud\u00e2ln due to the resemblance of the berries to those of serviceberry (see ud\u00e2ln in the section on trees). Mooney found that the roots were us ed to stop hemorrhages, combined with a species of wild rose for thrush, and the pounded root was rubbed on sore joints. Banks added that a tea of the roots was drunk fo r lower back pain and kidney problems (1953: 91). y\u00fagwil\u00fb - pitcher plant - Sarracenia purpurea L. and Sarracenia flava L. Y\u00fagwil\u00fb appears to be an opaque, proper name for the pitcher plant. Mooney identified the botanical species as S. flava and said it was once found near Birdtown, but was extinct at the time of his research. He actually identified it as a species of Dionaea , but his description was of a plant that tr aps flies, is 2 feet tall, and has yellow flowers about 2 inches across and a long root. No species of Dionaea matches this description and there are rare populations of S. flava in the region (Smith 1998: 62). Olbrechts identified it as S. purpurea , a more common species in the North Carolina mountains. He also recorded the synonyms ay\u00fagwil\u00fb , waedla, and tcskoyi kanati . He did not provide a gloss for the first two but the third glossed as 'the successful insect hunter' after the mythical first man, the hunter Kan\u00e1t (Mooney 1900: 242). Olbrechts found that it was used by nov ice medicine men as an aid to retain information. The plant was known to tr ap insects that found their way into the 312 specialized leaf structure. This was symbolic of the ability to retain information, much like the belief surrounding member s of the intermediate category \u00fanistil\u00fbist (see Part 1), and if the water from inside the plant was drunk it would, \"keep the knowledge acquired imprisoned in the mind (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 101).\" 313 Chapter 6 Kan\u00e9ska - Grass Mooney identified the term kan\u00e9ska as, \"the generic term for all grasses\", indicating that kan\u00e9ska was the name for the life form that included members of the family Poaceae, as well as the graminoid, or grass-like, plants known to the Cherokee. With the introduction of domesticated stock, it also became the word for hay. This category also includes a few flowering plants that have grass-like leaves. I have included the category gan\u00e1ga ('rush') in this category even though it is unclear from Mooney's notes whether the members of gan\u00e1ga are included in kan\u00e9ska or could be considered a separate life form. Mooney glosses gan\u00e1ga simply as 'rush', but 'it has been licked', indicati ng that the name is not opaque and might well be a folk generic. Mooney also stated that, a ccording to one of his informants, there were three or four varieties of gan\u00e1ga , suggesting that the category was too small to consider it a separate life form. For this chapter I have included all the botanical species that qualify as graminoids and the floweri ng species that were labeled as types of kan\u00e9ska . The number of graminoid species repor ted to be named or used by the Cherokee is relatively small when compared to the total number of species present in the mountains of North Carolina. However, this is congruous with Moerman's meta-analysis of the medicinal plants used by Native Americans. Moerman ( 1991) established a base 314 percentage by comparing the total number of plants found north of the Rio Grande with the total number recorded used by the 123 Native North American groups. He then demonstrated, using regression analysis, t hat the number of grasses and grass-like plants that had reported medicinal applicat ions was much lower than the predicted number established by taking the base percent of the number of species present in a particular life form. The Cherokee data appear to conform to his overall findings. There were 16 folk genera recorded in the grass life form representing 28 botanical species (see Table 6.1). Fourteen of the botanical species were included in three folk genera, gan\u00e1ga (5 species), kan\u00e9ska (5 species), and tsul\u00e2ski (4 species). All the gan\u00e1ga , except for one unidentified sedge, were rushes. The kan\u00e9ska tended to be the least botanically related, including tw o herbaceous species, a grass, and a sedge recognized for its grass-like qualities. The members of the genus tsul\u00e2ski were all grasses, but the lack of a gloss for tsul\u00e2ski limits our understanding of the perceived relationship between them. There were four non-graminoid flowering plants included in with linear leaves and parallel venation, suggesting a morphological similarity and natural affininty to the graminoids. 315 Table 6.1. Grass Index: Botanical Species and Folk Species Botanical Species Cherokee Genera and Species Botanical Species Cherokee (Panicum) dichotomum (L.) Gould var. dichotomum - forked panic grass Mooney did not provide a gloss or an explanation for the name agisi. He also recorded the name wtkiy\u00fast ('like wtk\u00fb') for several species of panic grass, indicating their collective resemblance to the grasses known as wtk\u00fb. The medicinal uses for these will be discussed below. gan\u00e1ga - 'rush' - Eleocharis spp . - spike-rush Due to the lack of a specific qualifie r, it appears that members of the genus Eleocharis were considered the prototypes for the category gan\u00e1ga . Mooney was not 316 able to identify this specimen to the spec ies level, but it would appear from the distribution maps in the Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas that the only common species in the mountains are Eleocharis obtusa (Willd.) road' - Juncus Willd. - path from n\u00fbn\u00e2h ('road' or 'trail') and (the Middle dialect form for 'it stands habi tually in the road') and is due to the plant's ability to thrive on compacted so ils from frequent traffic. The common name \"path rush\" is also indicative of this habitat preference. The qualifier n\u00fbn\u00e2h udetk was also the name given to Plantago major , due to its similar ability to thrive in areas of heavy traffic and erect habit (see Herbaceous Plants, Part 3). A warm infusion of the whole beaten plant was used to wash newborns as a prophylactic against disease and to prepare ballplayers for a match. The plant was not dried, but the roots could be found in winter by knowing the location of the plants. Banks (1953: 13) found that ball players would drink the tea so that, like the plant, they would remain erect and not fall down during the ma tch. He also found that infants were washed in the tea of both J. tenuis and P. major to impart the plants' strength and straightness to the infant's limbs and to prevent lameness. gan\u00e1ga ts ninahita gloss for tsninahita . Gan\u00e1ga ts ninahita appears to be an inclusive term encompassing all the 317 sedges and implies a relationship to the rushes. However, Mooney recorded a similar, seemingly inclusive, term for the genus Carex, kan\u00e9ska ts ninahita , which suggests that the Cherokee considered sedges to be grasses. He gave two examples with specific qualifiers (see below) that were only identified to the genus level as species of Carex , but he did not provide a gloss for tsninahita . Without a gloss or an explanation for the etymology for the phrase, it is difficult to discern the inclusiveness of these terms. Olbrechts also recorded the name ganuya ('it is placed under') for a species of Carex , but did not explain the gloss. He found that gan\u00e1ga ts ninahita was used for the - Juncus effusus L. - soft rush It is unclear why J. effusus would be considered the 'small' folk species of gan\u00e1ga . It reaches heights of .5 to 1.2 meters tall, while J. tenuis reaches a maximum height of .5 meters (Radford et al. 1968: 275). Mooney's notes indicated that both J. tenuis and J. effusus were labeled by the Cherokee as the 'small' folk species, but Olbrechts recorded the botanical species as J. effusus . And, while not a particularly small plant, J. effusus is generally much smaller than gan\u00e1ga \u00fatana , the 'large' species rattle, small'), an obvious reference to the noise made by the dried seed heads (see anisg\u00edna-(ts)un\u00e2 ns\u00fbta in Herbaceous Plants, Part 3). Gan\u00e1ga usd\u00ed- ga was used in the same manner as ts ninahita , for the - bull rush This is one of the tallest rushes, reaching heights of up to 2 meters tall (Radford et al. 1968: 196). Mooney also plant's pref erence for marshy environments. It was also and gan\u00e1ga of snakes'). Mooney added that rushes were tied into bunches, dried, and used like twine to tie bundles, the la rger ones split into sections (Ms. 1894). \u00edya - rivercane - Arundinaria gigantea (Walter) Muhl. Cane breaks ( ihy\u00e2hi) were once a common feature of the riverbottoms in the southeastern United States. The durable, flexible cane was used extensively by southeastern Native Americans for woven mate rials, such as baskets, walls for houses, and floor mats, as well as for musical instru ments, furniture, tools, and weapons (Hill 1997: 39-40). Blowguns were also made from cane. A length of the green cane would be heated over a fire, straightened by hand, and allowed to dry. The septa between nodes were drilled through the length of t he cane, then rasped to a smooth, even bore (Witthoft n.d.: 96). A flour made from c ane was also mentioned as a famine food, but the process was not described (Hill 1997: 40) . When purifying themselves for the hunt, hunters would wash with a tea of cane, cedar boughs, horsemint, and old tobacco (Payne n.d. a: 38). 319 iy\u00e1ya - no gloss - Cyperus strigosus L. - umbrella sedge Mooney did not provide a gloss for iy\u00e1ya , but it may be that this was considered the \"true\" kind of \u00edya, signified by the addition of the suffix -ya. However, this is speculation on my part. Mooney also recorded C. strigosus as kan\u00e9ska ig\u00e2 tenh ('swamp growing grass'), which was due to its preference for wet environments. He found it was used for rheumatism and in association with witches, but he did not elaborate on either. kans - 'swamp grass' - Orontium aquaticum L. - golden club Olbrechts glossed kans as 'swamp grass', but he did not explain the gloss. It appears to be a form of the word kan\u00e9ska ('grass'), but it is not clear how ig\u00e2t ('swamp') is incorporated into the name. Orontium aquaticum might not have been classified as a grass, as the leaves are not linear but range from ovate to elliptic (Radford et al. 1968:257), but will be placed here solely on the virtue of the gloss 'swamp grass'. Several sources indicate that kans was considered a powerful and valuable medicine. In the early 19 th century, the root of O. aquaticum was made into a tea with the root of a shrubby species of Cornus and used as an emetic by a medicine man after the death of a patient (Payne n.d. b: 586). He would dispose of all the medicines that were ineffective and not use any of them unt il the following year. Then he would purify himself with the emetic and pour some of the tea on hot stones to cleanse his hands. Mooney recorded O. aquaticum as one of the few remedies for smallpox. It was made into a tea in combination with Lindera benzoin and the patient would be washed 320 all over with the tea. The patient also drank a large quantity of the tea. A warm infusion of the pounded roots was used as a wash for wounds. Children were also bathed in a tea of the pounded or rubbed leaves as a prophy lactic against disease. It was observed that dew never stays on the plant, symbolizing it s ability to prevent disease from staying with a child. Mooney said the plant was considered to be very scarce by the late 19 th century (Ms. 1894). Olbrechts found O. aquaticum was used for uyos\u00f6\u00e7i e isti tsanan\u00e7tatia ('when they suffer painful remembrances of the dead') and to heal wounds and bruises such as those caused by arrows, bullets, or an ax. He also said it was used as a prophylactic to guard children, \"against any kind of disease. \" Infants would be bathed in a decoction of the plant at every new moon (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 76). Banks (1953: 11) added that the crushed root was used after scratching as a poultice for sore muscles. The plant was transplanted to nearby springs because it was so rare. The fruit of O. aquaticum was also used for food, but only after intensive processing and with restrictions associated with its use. An early 19 th century account described the process: This is a kind of fruit growing in pods. And very much resembling beans. The weed producing it grows in springs. This fruit must be boiled full twenty four hours, or it will prove a most deadly poi son. But after being sufficiently boiled, dried and pounded, it formed meal, or flour ve ry much resembling, in taste, that of wheat, and might be used for all the purposes of flour. It was also made into 321 mush. But after eating this they must eat no berries or any kind of fruit for 24 hours, lest it should kill them (Payne n.d. b: 269). The acrid portion, calcium oxalate crystals, causes an intense burning in the mouth. But drying the edible portion can eliminate th is toxic aspect (Peterson 1977: 156). kansiy\u00fast - 'like golden club' - Clintonia borealis bluebead-lily The name stems from the resembl ance of the leaves to those of kans (Orontium aquaticum ). Like kans, it is not clear that the Cherokee classified this as a grass, but I have included it here due to it s association with its counterpart. No medicinal uses were attributed to C. borealis . Britton, Stearns, and Pogg - grass pink While the flower of C. tuberosus is predominantly pink to rose-purple, the upper lip has a yellow beard (Smith 1999: 24), hence the name kan\u00e9ska dal\u00e2nige adsil\u00fb sk. The single, narrow, pointed leaf qualifies this as a type of kan\u00e9ska. No medicinal applications were recorded for C. tuberosus . kan\u00e9ska g\u00fbnah\u00edta ig\u00e2 tenh - 'long the swamp' - no botanical species Olbrechts recorded the Cherokee name, but was not able to provide a botanical identification. This may be a synonym for Cyperus strigosus (see iy\u00e1ya above), but it 322 could also be one of many wetland-loving s pecies of graminoid plant found in the mountains. He found that it was used with Dioscorea villosa for the condition known as g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they by Miller - blue-eyed grass The Cherokee name and the common name bot h stem from the blue flowers that grow at the tips of the grass-like l eaves. Olbrechts also recorded the synonym dal\u00e2nige unastetsi kan\u00e9ska ('yellow rooted grass'). He found it was used for a wide range of conditions such as unawasti egwa ('big chill'), uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i ayeligogi uniyel\u00f6 n\u00f6\u00e7i ('they have made it like it'). Banks added that an infusion of the roots was used fo r a form of diarrhea typified by yellow stools (1953: 20). It was considered especially effective for this condition in children. ts ninahita appears term for the genus Carex . Mooney recorded these two folk species growing' and 'large' kan\u00e9ska ts ninahita , but did not identify the botanical species or provide a gloss for the names. However, tsninahita appears to refer to the plant or one of its parts as having a long quality. Other Cherokee terms ending in - ahita were glossed as with the descriptor grass' L. - sedge d stems from kan\u00e9ska ('grass') and w\u00e2tige ('brown'), due to the color of the plants in the fall and winter. Olbrechts found that A. virginicus was evoked in a formula for frostbitten feet, the accompanying prayer addressed to the spirit of the Rabbit (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 258-259). The patient would experience relief from frostbite by placing their feet under a warm covering, much the same way the rabbit finds shelter from winter weather under broom sedge. The rabbit was addressed because it is one of the creatures that can wa lk on the snow without suffering frostbite. This may relate more to a prophylactic measure against frostbite than an actual cure. The Cherokee were reported to place soft grasses in their moccasins as insulation against the cold in the winter months and to cushion their feet when hunting and traveling. Witthoft identified this grass as a small species of Panicum , but A. virginicus may have been an acceptable alternative, as it was the favored material to for bedding in the Cherokee mountain cabins (Witthoft n.d.: 75-76). Banks found that A. virginicus was an ingredient in a salve made with mutton tallow used to cure sores and as a tea to heal cases of dermatitis from contact with poison ivy. The tops were also used alone or combined with onion skins and made into a yellow dye (1953: 8). sal\u00e2l un\u00edgist the plural form of ag\u00edst ('food'). Mooney did not explain the nam e. He also recorded two other plants as sal\u00e2l un\u00edgist, Hypoxis spp . and the nut rush, . There are several species 324 of Scleria found in the North Carolina mountai ns, but the only common species of Hypoxis is H. hirsuta (L.) Coville. No uses were recorded for sal\u00e2l usd\u00ed-ga - no gloss, 'small' - Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash. - Indian grass Mooney did not provide a gloss for selagw\u00fbts, but a similar word, se la wo yi , was glossed as 'fodder' by the We stern Cherokee (Alexander 1971: 61). Sorghastrum nutans is known to be quite nutritious for livestock (Brown 1979: 178) and may well have been gathered and used as animal fodder. The identification of S. nutans as the 'small' folk species may have been a misidentification on Mooney's part. The following species, Saccharum baldwinii , was identified as the 'large' species of selagw\u00fbts, but S. nutans reaches a height of 2.5 m while S. baldwinii only grows to about 1.5 m (Radford et al. 1968: 165 & 162). The two may have been reversed in Mooney's notes. Mooney also identified Echinochloa crusgali (L.) Beauvios as selagw\u00fbts usd\u00ed-ga (Ms. 1894), which was introduced to this country as animal fodder (Brown 1979: 184). Sorghastrum nutans was the primary material used to cons truct Cherokee brooms (Witthoft n.d.: 76). Olbrechts recorded two medicinal applications for the folk genus selagw\u00fbts, but did not specify which folk species and did not i dentify the associated botanical species. Selagw\u00fb ts was used as part of an emetic formula used to treat anskits\u00f6'\u00f6 sk\u00f6i ('whenever they dream (of...)') and for known as duletsi ('kernels'). gloss, 'large' Spreng. - beard grass, plume grass Saccharum baldwinii was identified as the 'large' species of selagw\u00fbts, but this was probably a misidentification on Mooney's part (see selagw\u00fbts usd\u00ed-ga above). There is no further information available about the Cherokee relationship to this grass. s\u00e9luiy\u00fast - 'like corn' - Echinochloa crusgali (L.) Beauvios grass The name s\u00e9luiy\u00fast stems from s\u00e9lu ('corn') and the suffix - iy\u00fast ('like'), indicating a perceived resemblance of E. crusgali to the corn plant. It has already been mentioned as an introduced animal fodder (see selagw\u00fbts usd\u00ed-ga above). s\u00e9luts - 'corn's mother' stems from s\u00e9lu ('corn') and ust ('mother'). Mooney found that the grains were used for necklaces, and Banks added that the necklaces were placed on teething infants (1953: 9). Since C. lacryma-jobi was an introduced species, the name s\u00e9luts may have originally been applied to Tripsicum dactyloides L., a native plant in the region that shares many traits with the corn plant. It was once considered the progenitor of corn, as the wild corn plant is not known, but genetic analysis has shown this to not be the case (Brown 1979: 104). s\u00e9lutiy\u00fast - 'like corn's mother' - no botanical species The name here stems from the resemblance of the plant to s\u00e9luts ('corn's mother'). Mooney tentatively i dentified it as a species of Zizania , but wild rice is only 326 known to grow in the coastal region of North Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 125). No other information is available for t he Cherokee relationship to this plant. ts\u00edstu gat\u00e1ga - 'rabbit tail' - Eriophorum virginicum L. - cotton grass The name ts\u00edstu gat\u00e1ga is a composite of ts\u00edstu ('rabbit') and gat\u00e1ga ('tail'), but the other synonyms recorded by Mooney may provide an explanation for the name. He also recorded this plant as ts\u00edstu ukskil\u00fb t ('rabbit, tail sticking straight up in the air') and ts\u00edstu uks ('rabbit anus'), both suggesting the im age of an erect tail. Mooney did not associate this Cherokee name with a bot anical species, but Banks found the name 'rabbit tail' associated with a species of Eriophorum . Members of this genus are collectively known as cotton grass due to t he clusters of white hairs that subtend the fruits. These also resemble the white, raised tail of a rabbit. The species virginicum is the only one found in the mountains of Nort h Carolina (Radford et al. 1968: 201). The only known use was a vague reference to its inclusion in a medicine accompanying a prayer (Banks 1953: 10). tsul\u00e2geta - no gloss - Cymophyllus fraseri (Andrz.) Mackenzie Mooney only provided the Cherokee and botanical name for this plant (Ms. 1894). No gloss or uses were available. 327 tsul\u00e2ski atelagiski - no gloss - Panicum gattingeri Nash - panic grass Mooney did not provide a gloss for the folk generic or the specific qualifier. This is unfortunate, as he included the nam es of four folk species of tsul\u00e2ski in his notes (Ms. 1894). tsul\u00e2ski \u00fatana - no gloss, 'large' - Dichanthelium commutatum (J. A. Schultes) Gould - panic grass This was considered the 'large' folk species of tsul\u00e2ski. No more information is available about the Cherokee relationship to this plant. tsul\u00e2ski uw\u00e1sgil adsil\u00fbsk specific qualifier consists of uw\u00e1sgil ('soft') and adsil\u00fbsk ('flower'), referring to the soft tops associated with this grass. No uses were attributed to E. cilianensis . tsul\u00e2ski yahi - no gloss - Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scopoli - crab grass Only the Cherokee name and botanical name are known for this species. tsul\u00e2ski-iy\u00fast - 'like tsul\u00e2ski ' - Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertner - goose grass This grass was named for its resemblance to the folk genus tsul\u00e2ski , but no explanation for the resemblance was available. 328 wtk\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga - no gloss, 'small' - no botanical name - star grass Mooney did not provide a gloss for wtk\u00fb, but this was the 'small' folk species. The only identification that Mooney provided for wtk\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga was the common name \"star grass\", which is usually applied to Aletris farinosa L., but could be the common name for a number of plants. Wtk\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga was used to make arrow shafts for the bows used by young boys to practice their shooting skills. wtk\u00fb \u00fatana - no gloss, 'large' - Glyceria spp . grass to wtk\u00fb \u00fatana , the 'large' folk species of wtk\u00fb, identified to the genus level. No other information was available concerning the Cherokee relationship to this genus. wtkiy\u00fast - 'like wtk\u00fb' - Dichanthelium spp. - panic grass This folk genus was named for its resemblance to wtk\u00fb. Mooney named three species of Dichanthelium as wt kiy\u00fast, D. candestinum (L.) Gould, D. dichotomum (L.) Gould, and D. latifolium (L.) Gould & C. A. Clark. Dichanthelium latifolium also went by the synonym adakehegi usdi , but Mooney did not provide a gloss for this name (Ms. 2235). However, he also recorded it as the name for a species of Tofieldia , a plant that is occasionally found in mountain wetlands and that is more closely related to Aletris farinosa than Dichanthelium (see wtk\u00fb usd\u00ed-ga above). No uses for wtkiy\u00fast. 329 - 'honey' or 'like honey' glossed as 'honey', 'bee', or 'molasses'. The name relates to the cane juice that is processed into a light molasses resembling dark honey. The name watul\u00edsiy\u00fast ('like honey') stems from the same source and both were used for S. vulgare . Sorghum was probably had a late introduction as a useful plant to the Cherokee. They were reluctant to take up the use of the plow until after the Revolutionary War and did not incorporate the European grain crops until after this time (Goodwin 1977: 129). Mooney found that the pounded roots of watul\u00eds were combined with Pedicularis canadensis and Scutellaria lateriflora for fever and spasms that might accompany childbirth (Ms. 1894). About a pint was dr unk at frequent intervals throughout the day. Mooney's informant said that this was a great remedy and the ingredients were expensive. However, the remainder of his de scription suggests that, while the medicinal value was attributed to a plant called watul\u00eds, it was not S. vulgare . The plant he was describing was found in swamps and found in wi nter by the dry stalks, but not eaten. Sorghum is not a plant that favors swampy areas and it was grown for consumption. It also would not have been scarce once it was introduced into Cherokee agriculture. 330 Chapter 7 Eg\u00fbl or Ig\u00fbl - Fern Mooney did not explain in his notes t he two phonetic spellings for the category that encompassed the ferns. He oft en distinguished between the upper and middle dialects of Cherokee, but did not indicate that this was a dialectical difference. In this section, I will use the phonetic spellings that appear most frequently in the notes of the different researchers. Mooney also did not indicate that eg\u00fbl or ig\u00fbl represented a distinct life form. But Olbrec hts clarified this point in The Swimmer Manuscript . In the formula for malarial chills, he states that ig\u00fbl, \"is a name given to any variety of fern; without any more definite description it is not possible to identify it...\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 228). This would indicate that all ig\u00fbl must be identified to the folk specific level or the term is considered descr iptive of the life form. However, Mooney did indicate in his notes that eg\u00fbl or ig\u00fbl was a more inclusive term by pointing out that: Heart trouble: caused by the lungs wrapping around the heart. All species of ig\u00fbl, including also k\u00e2ga-sk\u00fbtag (Adiantum pedatum L.) are coiled up when young and unwind as they grow, hence tea of any or all is used for heart troubles, to unwind the lungs from around the heart. 331 This is especially important if the term ig\u00fbl is accepted to be polysemous, representing both the life form and a generic category. Many species of ferns are not labeled by the generic ig\u00fbl and this piece of information from M ooney suggests that at least all ferns that unfurl are included in the same life fo rm category. I will include the walking fern, Asplenium rhyzophyllum (L.) Link, in this category solely due to its botanical classification and not from an inclusion in the category from information provided by Mooney or Olbrechts. Its habit is somewhat different from many Southern Appalachian ferns, having an entire, single bladed leaf, but there is no obvious reason to exclude it from this category. It is not surprising that the Cherokee consi ders ferns as a distinct life form. They are the most ancient and primitive of va scular plants and their habit and reproductive structures distinguish them from ot her vascular plant life forms. While Aureolaria pectinata (Nuttall) as ig\u00fbliyusti (Ms. 2235), or 'like fern,' there no indication that it was considered a type of fern, but the name was descriptive of the shape of the leaves and not a criteria for classification with other ig\u00fbl. One fern species, identified in the same manuscript as Botrychium virginanum (L.) Swartz, was also glossed as ig\u00fbliyusti ; however, it was also reported to have yellow flowers, so this was an obvious mistake in matching the Cherokee names to the proper species and this was most likely a species of Aureolaria . Some confusion exists due to Cherokee synonyms at the folk genus and species level for the various biological species. Also, the Cherokee folk genera and species were sometimes identified as more than one biological species by the botanists who identified Mooney's voucher specimens. As verifica tion of archival materi al is difficult, all 332 of the synonyms and biological species names will be provided to insure as complete a record as possible. Table 7.1 shows the relationship of the 11 botanical species recorded by the reachers to the Cherokee species included in the fern life form. Table 7.1. Fern Index: Botanical Species and Folk Species Botanical Name novaboracensis (L.) Nieuwl. - New York fern Mooney noted that the specific qualifier uw\u00e1sgil ('soft') was due to the softness of the leaves or fronds. Both botanical names were included in Mooney's notes and appeared to be the identifications of the Smit hsonian botanists, but it was not clear if this was a case of underdifferentiation in the Cherokee system or confusion between the field and laboratory researchers. He also recorded the synonym y\u00e2n-a uts sa usd\u00edga ('the bear lies on it, small') for Dennstaedtia punctilobula (see below). Mooney 333 highlighted the folk species eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil as a remedy for heart troubles and, while all ferns were considered beneficial for this condition, his notation suggests that this species was considered especially useful for this condition. Olbrechts added to the confusion by recording the . He recorded it as a possible component of a medicine for \"the Bi g Chill\" or malarial fevers (Mooney uw\u00e1sgil as Cystoperis fragilis (L.) Bernh., but in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 228), he identifies C. fragilis as ig\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil n\u00f6yoehi (see below). He 'smooth', but he had also glossed dawiskage in the same manner, indicating a possible misinterpretation of uw\u00e1sgil. ig\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil n\u00f6yoehi - 'the smooth (soft) fern that grows on rocks' - Polypodium virginianum L. - rock cap fern or Cystoperis fragilis (L.) Bernh. - fragile fern The two botanical species identified here ex emplify the difficulty presented by the recorded glosses recorded for uw\u00e1sgil. Cystoperis fragilis could easily be considered one of the 'soft' species of ig\u00fbl, as indicated by the common name \"fragile fern\". But Olbrechts glossed it as 'smooth', a mo re apt description for the glossy-leafed P. virginianum , which he also specific qualifier n\u00f6yoehi ('growing on rocks') provides no help in distinguishing the intended species as both are commonly found growing on rocks. Olbrechts included C. fragilis as a potential ingredient in the for unawasti - Osmunda cinnamomea L. - cinnamon fern The designation of this particular fern as t he 'little' species is confounding, as it is a fairly large fern, much larger than eit her of the biological species cited above. Olbrechts independently identified eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil usd\u00ed as O. cinnamomea but, consistent with his other interpretations, gl ossed it as 'little smooth fern.' But both men the synonym tsis\u00e1t \u00fatana , or 'it smothers, large,' referring to its use as an agent to smoke animals out of logs and yellow jackets out of the hive so the larvae could be harvested for consumption. Other synonyms Mooney recorded for O. cinnamomea included and y\u00e2n-a \u00fatana or 'the bear lies on it, large' (see below). Along with its use in flushing out animals and insects, the bruised root of O. cinnamomea was used for severe diarrhea (flux) and, as with other ferns, for heart troubles. ig\u00fbl gigage uy\u00f6du'wite - 'fern with a red stalk' - (not identified) This was also reported to be used against \"the Big Chill\" (intermittent fevers due to malaria) as well as for the condition known as 'when it breaks them', a form of rheumatism (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 292). It may be one of the several species of ferns mentioned in The Swimmer Manuscript for \"the Big Chill\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932:228), but having a red stalk is not a key char acteristic used to identify any of them. 335 ig\u00fbl gadusi ehi - 'fern growing in the mount ians' - (not identified) Olbrechts found that this fern was used for the disease \"when they discharge light colored blood from their bowels\", but he was unable to identify the botanical species associated with the Cherokee name. ig\u00fbl igatehi - 'swamp growing fern' - Onoclea fern The specific qualifier igatehi ('swamp growing') was due to the preference of this fern for wet, low-lying areas. No medicinal used were attributed to O. \u00ednat\u00fb g\u00e1n'ka - 'snake's tongue' - Asplenium rhyzophyllum L. - walking fern The name for this plant comes from the shape of the leaf, which is very long and pointed. Mooney recorded that the whole plant was collected for use, as the roots are very small, and applied to problems caused by dreaming of snakes. Will West Long elaborated on this use, adding that Hepatica acutiloba DC was added to the decoction and the action of the resulting emetic stopped the dreams from reoccurring (Banks 1953: 4). It was also used in a formula for the condition known as dal\u00e2nige A. pedatum was called 'crow skin' because of its black stalk, which resembled the exposed areas of a crow. An in fusion of the leaves, combined with those of other ferns, was used to unwind the lungs from around the heart and also, with an unidentified fern referred to as \"bottom fern \", for rheumatism and chills. It was also used 336 alone for fevers, the patient drinking a tea made from the plant and also bathing their face with the remaining tea. A poultice of the beaten roots was applied when there was loss of the use of limbs (Mooney Ms. 1894). The \"bottom fern\" could be Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) Schott, which Olbrechts recorded as one of the species that could be used in combination with A. pedatum for \"the Big Chill\". It is commonly found growing along wooded streambanks (Cobb 1984: 126). Witthoft (1947) recorded that a decoction of the whole plant was considered \"very strong medicine\" and was used as an emetic for the flu and accompanying fever. Banks (1953: 3) added that the powdered leaves we re smoked in case of heart trouble and an infusion of the whole plant was used to treat children suffering from a form of paralysis associated with severe illnesses such as pneumonia. The infusion was blown on the head and chest of the patient and in other areas where the patient was hot. k\u00e2ga sk\u00fbtagiy\u00fast - 'like crow skin' - Pteridium aquilinum bracken fern This fern was considered 'like crow skin' because the stalk turns dark brown with age, resembling the dark stalk of Adiantum pedatum . Mooney described this as a long, thin fern with a woody root (Ms. 2497) . He and Olbrechts also recorded the name ats\u00eds\u00e1ti , or 'to make fire with,' but neither elaborated on this application of the plant. Olbrechts also recorded the names dayuwayi and tcisati as synonyms for P. aquilinum , but did not record a gloss for either. No medicinal applications were attributed to P. aquilinum . 337 useliti - 'it is held virginianum (L.) Swartz - rattlesnake fern Olbrechts provided the gloss 'it is held erect' for useliti and this appears to be the singular form of tsusalt, the folk generic for one of the synonyms for Eupatorium perfoliatum (see g\u00e1tats\u00fal gatush in herbaceous plants, Part 1). Mooney recorded the gloss for tsusalt as 'it lifts itself up', evoking the image of a person holding up their arms. The petiole and fertile frond of B. virginianum also have this erect quality and it is reflected in the name useliti . Mooney found that a decoction of the r oot was drunk for three days to treat fevers. The root was dried for winter use as the top of the plant dies in early fall. Olbrechts found that it was used for nightmares about snakes, a condition known as inad\u00f6 danskits\u00f6i ('when they dream of snakes'), as well as for actual snakebites, but he gave no details for its use. This is probably the \"fern-snake-root\" mentioned by Adair as one of the several snakebite remedies carried in shot pouches by all Indian hunters and warriors (Adair 1974: 247). y\u00e2n-a uts sa \u00fatana - it, large' - Polystichum acrostichoides (Michx.) Schott - Christmas fern The name stems from y\u00e2n-a ('bear') and utssa, the third person of agwatssta ('I am lying down on it'). Mooney st ates that this name was due to the fact that this fern and the small variety (see below) both have a single stalk and there is a tendency for the leaves to lie flat instead of remaining erect. Apparently this makes the ferns look as if a bear had slept on t hem. He admits that other informants also identified Osmunda cinnamomea as the same plant, but both he and Olbrechts found P. 338 acrostichoides labeled as y\u00e2n-a uts sa. Mooney also identified it as such in Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 327), stating that a dec oction of the roots was used as an emetic and for toothache, as well as taken internally and applied topically after scratching for rheumatism. It was one of seve ral ferns mentioned as a possible remedy for \"the Big Chill\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 228). A cold infusion of the roots was used for stomach aches and bowel complaints, while a tea to the leaves was used to treat indigestion (Banks 1953: 5). This may also be the \"bottom fern\" mentioned above (see k\u00e2ga-sk\u00fbtag). y\u00e2n-a uts sa usd\u00edga bear lies (Michx.) - hay-scented was considered the 'small' species of y\u00e2n-a uts sa, but it was also recorded as y\u00e2n-a uts sa uw\u00e1sgil ('the bear lies on it, soft'), further implicating it as the primary eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil ('soft fern'). The uses for D. punctilobula have already been discussed above (see eg\u00fbl uw\u00e1sgil). 339 Chapter 8 \u00dagal-hi - Moss Ustal\u00e9ta - Lichen Mooney wrote the following about \u00fagal-hi (also used in the shortened form, \u00fagal): \u00dagal or \u00fagal-hi is the generic name for mosses, excepting lichens. The Cherokee distinguish them by habitat, as water moss, rock moss, balsam moss, etc. However, of the four examples he recorded as types of \u00fagal-hi (see below), only one is a true moss. The others include a green, br anching lichen, an unidentified plant, and a flowering plant. \u00dagal-hi could more properly be glossed as 'mosses and moss-like plants' and may have included a wide range of mosses, non-fruticose lichens, and moss-like flowering plants. Mooney recorded ustal\u00e9ta as a \"generic\" term for lichens, but according to Will West Long, it referred to the fruticose (leaf-like) lichens that grew on rocks. Ustal\u00e9ta was glossed as 'scrapings', a name \"applied to dri ed food remains that stick to the inside of the pot.\" Ustal\u00e9ta stemmed from utsal\u00e9st ('it is sticky'), the name for dough or wheat products, and was in reference to the appearance of the lichens that seemed to be peeling off the rocks. 340 Table 8.1. Moss and Lichen Index: Botanical Name and Folk Species Botanical ('growing in the water') signifies that the plant was submerged in water, as opposed to amayutehi ('growing near water'), which was reserved for plants growing at the water's edge. The best description of its use came from one of Mooney's small manuscripts, a list of place names, descriptions of locations, mound sites, etc. (Ms. 1894), \"In the old days, rock moss was gathered and dried, powdered, and used like salt.\" While this may appear to be \u00fagal-hi n\u00fby\u00fb \u00fasta (see below), Witthoft clarified that it wa s, \"a salt ... prepared by burning the dried aquatic plants which grows on rocks in the swift moving mountain streams, called \"moss\"...\". The ashes that comprised this \"s alt\" were used in flavoring food, and were especially important for bean bread (Wittho ft n.d.: 56). Adair also made a similar reference to the used of aquatic plants, stat ing how the Cherokee \"eat the saltish moss and grass, which grows on the rocks, and under the surface of the waters (Adair 1974: 239). \" 341 \u00fagal-hi at barbata (L.) Vigg. - beard lichen, old man's beard The specific qualifier at \u00fasta stems from at ('wood') and \u00fasta, a form of titsta\u00fb ('I am hanging on'), referring to the fi lamentous, gray-green lichens that hang on tree trunks and branches. Mooney identified this as Usnea barbata , but he said the name was a general term for \"all hanging tree mosses\". Mooney found that the tree moss growing exclusively on hickory trees was used to treat thrush (Ms. 1894). \u00fagal-hi n\u00fby\u00fb \u00fasta and \u00fasta (see above), but Mooney wrote that the name encompass ed the \"common\" moss growing on rocks, as well as on wood and soil. This was applied to a species of Hypnum , the only true moss that Mooney identified as a type of \u00fagal-hi, but was probably the general term for a wide variety of mosses. \u00fagal-hi \u00fbnag\u00e9 sth-eh - 'moss that grows in the Ba lsam forest' - no species name The specific qualifier \u00fbnag\u00e9 stems from fraseri and Picea rubens (see the chapter ('dwelling in a forest'), sth ('thicket' or 'forest') being combination of at ('wood') and h ('living' or 'dwelling'). So sth-eh literally means 'living where the g\u00fbnahita ('long'). Mooney did not observe this plant, but relied on the description of his informants. It was described as, \"growing 2 to 3 feet high and only around the base of balsam trees.\" This 342 description does not fit any moss or moss-like plant with which I am familiar. No medicinal uses were recorded for this species of \u00fagal-hi. ustal\u00e9ta - 'scrapings' - Parmelia spp . The meaning of ustal\u00e9ta is discussed above. According to Mooney, the name also applied to \"scum mosses\", which grew on damp ground and resembled lichens. These may have been lungworts; members of the genus Lobaria , a group that prefers damp environments (Nash 1996: 234). Several of the fruticose lichens were harvested from fallen twigs and used on cancerous sores (Banks 1953: 2). 343 Chapter 9 Crop Plants The crop plants will include the nativ e herbaceous species that were dependent on humans for their propagation, \"native\" here re ferring to plants that were in use before contact with Europeans, as well as those that were introduced by Europeans. I have also included the introduced condiment pepper and beverage coffee in this section. They were not and could not be grown by the Cherokee in their cool mountain homeland, but were embraced by the Cher okee and purchased from outside sources. Mooney also included both in his notes and st ressed their cultural relevance to the Cherokee. Corn will also be discussed in this category as it was the Cherokee's primary crop plant, but it will also be ment ioned in the chapter on grasses. Table 9.1. Crop Plant Index: Botanical Name and Folk Species Botanical Species Cherokee Species Botanical Species Cherokee Species - Lactuca sativa L. - lettuce name here stems from ag\u00e1st ('raw') and ag\u00edst ('food'). The Cherokee usually cooked all their greens (Witthoft n.d.: 24), so the introduced lettuce would have stood out as a raw edible green. ats\u00edla - 'fire' - Brassica nigra (L.) Koch - black mustard Mooney claimed that this was table mustard and that the name ats\u00edla was due to the peppery taste. I found no information on its introduction to the Cherokee. dik\u00e1t\u00fblt - 'things to sprinkle on' - Piper nigrum L. - black pepper This is the Cherokee name for the comm on table condiment. While not actually a viable crop plant in the temperate regions, it was introduced as a spice to the Cherokee and became an integral part of their diet. But I found no record of when it first appeared among the Cherokee. The name dik\u00e1t\u00fblt stems from detsik\u00e1tutl\u00fbsk\u00fb ('I am ('I am sprinkling it on'), due to the action of dispersing ground pepper. Mooney gave no indication of Cherokee attitudes towards or non-culinary uses for pepper. gal\u00fbn - 'being in it' - vulgaris Scringe gourd The folk generic gal\u00fbn stems from gal\u00fb ('it is in it'). This refers to any kind of hollow vessel. Witthoft claims there were two types, a long neck variety used as a 345 dipper or ladle and a short necked variety that were used as bottles, cups, rattles, or salt containers (Witthoft n.d.: 202). Besides being used as a general container, Mooney found that the Cherokee hung hollow gourds on l ong poles to attract purple martins. The bird was a favorite of the Cherokee becaus e of its aggressive nature and its tendency to chase crows away from the crops (M ooney 1900: 454-455). Gourd seed were also mashed and soaked in hot water to treat difficulty in urination (Witthoft 1946). g\u00fbg\u00edst - 'something to eat any time' Citrullus vulgaris Schrader. - watermelon The Cherokee generic g\u00fbg\u00edst demonstrates the attitude of the Cherokee towards watermelons. Watermelons were observed in Native American gardens as early as 1562 and had spread to Virginia by 1587 (Davis 2000: 51). Not only did the Cherokee consider them an acceptable food, but they we re so relished that they were 'something to eat any time' they were available. The name g\u00fbg\u00edst stemmed from ag\u00edst ('food'). \u00edya - pumpkin - Cucurbita pepo L. The folk generic \u00edya appears to be a proper, opaque name for the native varieties of pumpkin and squash. Witthoft said that the native varieties were no longer grown when he visited the reservation (late 1940s or early 1950s), but only the typical orange varieties were grown at that time. In hi s discussion of the preservation technique for pumpkins, he said the pumpkin was peeled and sliced in a spiral like an intact apple peel. Several of these (ten or more) were skewered on to the end of a stick and placed near the fireplace until dry. The dried pumpk in flesh was then stored in a sack and later soaked and cooked into a gruel (n.d.: 200-201). 346 kagama to kagama as a \"corruption\" of cucumber. Cucumers were first observed in Native American gardens in Florida as early as 1562, so they may have reached the Cherokee at an early date Davi s 2000: 51). Little else is available concerning the Cherokee relationship to the cucumber. k\u00e1w - coffee or tuyay\u00fast - 'like beans' - Coffea arabica L. K\u00e1w is the Cherokee pronunciation of coff ee, there being no \"f\" in the Cherokee language. The synonym tuyay\u00fast ('like beans') was due to the resemblance of coffee beans to the beans grown in Cherokee gardens or t\u00faya. Again, this is not a temperate crop, but was imported and embraced by t he Cherokee. Mooney found that the more conservative Cherokee considered coffee to be a poison, but it was embraced by the more progressive factions as early as the 1820s (Mooney 1900: 214, Goodwin 1977: 129). Before 1900, the Cherokee would roast green coffee beans in much the same manner as parching corn, the beans placed in a Dutch oven with hot ashes and heated until they were roasted. These were then \"ground\" by pounding them in the large corn mortars (Witthoft n.d.: 54). n\u00fan - potato or 'tuber' - Solanum tuberosum L. Mooney was of the opinion that the name n\u00fan was originally applied to Apios americana (see dun\u00fan ig\u00e2tenh above), but was changed as the Irish potato became more popular. He also found that it was called n\u00fan gsakwl\u00fbn ('potato, round), the qualifier gsakwl\u00fbn being the plural form of ansakwal\u00fbn ('round'). Mooney 347 claimed that these were an early introduc tion, but he does not suggest how early, and that they were highly esteemed by the Cherokee (Mooney 1900: 214). n\u00fan g\u00fbnah\u00edta - 'potato, long' - Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. - sweet potato This is another introduced crop plant that was adopted soon after contact with Europeans, probably due to Spanish introduction (Goodwin 1977: 55). Archaeological evidence of sweet potato use is lacking, but they appear to have been introduced from the West Indies and are thought to have been grown in Native American gardens in northern Florida and South Carolina in the early 17 th century (Davis 2000: 49). The qualifier g\u00fbnah\u00edta ('long') was often presented in its plural form, ts\u00fbn\u00ednah\u00edta or din\u00ednah\u00edta , and refers to the long tubers of the sweet potato. s\u00e2kwl un\u00edgist - 'horse foods' - Avena sativa L. - oats The name stems from s\u00e2kwl ('horse') and un\u00edgist, the plural form of a\u00edgist ('food'). There is some question as to whet her the Cherokee actually grew oats as did their white neighbors (Goodwin 1977: 129), but t hey were obviously familiar with the grain and would more than likely have acquired it for their horses. However, it is not clear if they considered it an acc eptable food for human consumption. s\u00e9lu - corn - Zea mays L. The name for corn is the same as the name of the first woman, Selu, who, according to Cherokee myth, was responsible for the introduction of corn into the world (Mooney 1900: 249). There is not direct ev idence that, even though botanists classify Z. 348 mays as a grass, the Cherokee did as well. Ho wever, they did associate it with other plants that obviously were grasses (see the chapter on grasses). Mooney identified two folk species of s\u00e9lu, a sweet corn called s\u00e9lu un\u00edtsima ('shriveled corn') and a type of popcorn called antaskski ('they pop or burst'). The former stems from \u00fatsima ('shriveled') and was due to the wrinkled appearance of the kernels, while the latter was from atask\u00fb ('it pops or bursts with swelling') due to the expansive, exploding nature of popc orn. Mooney specified that antaskski did not need to be accompanied by the folk generic s\u00e9lu, which suggests that the association with that folk genus was implied. Witthoft recorded several varieties of flour corn, although he found that the distinct varieties were intermixing and ge tting harder to distinguish. The small-eared, white-grained variety was called disnul\u00e1, a proper, opaque name. A mixed variety that had yellow and red stripes on white kernels was called seluyah\u00ed and the large-eared, eight-rowed, white variety was called seludiyt\u00ed, but no glosses were recorded for either. The deeply colored corn, usually consis ting of deep blue, yellow, or red kernels, was called negadagw\u00f3 , again with no gloss (n.d.: 183). C oarse pieces of corn meal were boiled into a thick soup called ganahena that Witthoft identified as a type of hominy. The diluted, fermented versi on of the corn gruel was known as ganahena amage\u00ed , a sour beverage made in large ceramic vessels used exclusively for this purpose. This was the preferred table beverage of the Cherokee and resembled the sofki of the Creeks (n.d.: 191-192). Corn was arguably the most important component in the Cherokee diet. The most popular way to prepare corn was in the form of corn bread. But this is more like a 349 boiled dumpling, and is nothing like the baked cornbread made from dried ground corn. The corn was picked in the milk stage and partially dried, or was boiled in the husk and dried in the sun for winter use. The partially dried or reconstituted dried corn is then pounded in the corn mortar until it form ed a moist dough. Beans, chestnuts, sweet potatoes, hickory nuts, walnuts, groundnut t ubers, or a wide range of berries were seasonally added to flavor the bread. The dough was rolled into a slightly flattened dumpling, wrapped in corn leaves, and dropped in boiling water until cooked. Hickory leaves were sometimes used as a substitute for corn leaves as wrappers for the bread. Other means to process corn included parching, soaking in ashes or soda and ground into meal or made into hominy, or made into a fermented gruel and drunk as a table beverage (Witthoft n.d.: 185-195). The growing influence of Euro-American culture led to changes in the processing of corn and, as early as 1897, much of the corn on the reservation was processed into dry corn m eal at local grist mills (Greene and Robinson 1986). Volunteer corn, or corn that had self-s eeded from the previous year's crop, was one of the medicinal plants used in the Cher okee version of the Green Corn Ceremony (Witthoft 1946). Other sources mention the use of the silks and parched grains as medicine, but no mention is made of the preparation techniques or the afflictions addressed by these remedies (Chiltoskey 1975). sk\u00e9w - 'making heads' - Brassica oleracea L. - cabbage Some of Mooney's informants insisted that the name sk\u00e9w applied only to the actual head of cabbage, the name for the plant being tsugw\u00fbnt\u00e9na or tsug\u00fant\u00e9na ('large 350 leaves'). In another entry in his notes, he called the curly variety of B. oleracea tsug\u00fant\u00e9nay\u00fb ('real cabbage'), the suffix or 'real' kind. Timberlake mentioned cabbages growing in Cherokee gardens in the mid-eighteenth century (Williams 1927: 68), possibly the earli est recording of the Cherokee integration of the crop into their regular diet. Witthoft found that the inner leaves were strung on a thread and dried for winter use (n.d.: 204). s\u00fbk - 'it smells' - Allium cepa L. - onion Mooney thought that s\u00fbk might be a shortened form of g\u00e1w's\u00fbk ('smeller'), so called because of its pungent odor. Little was written about the Cherokee association with onions, other than a brief reference to their introduction to the Cherokee in the pre- Revolutionary period (Goodwin 1977: 131). ts\u00e2l\u00e2 - tobacco - Nicotiana tabacum L. Mooney speculated that the original ts\u00e2l\u00e2 was Nicotiana rustica L. (see below), the original tobacco grown by Native Amer icans in the Southeast before it was replaced in cultural importance by the introduced N. tabacum . Nicotiana tabacum Nicotiana tabacum was most likely introduced to the No rth American mainland from the West Indies soon after European contact (Heiser 1992), but it is not clear when it was first incorporated by the Cherokee. Ts\u00e2l\u00e2 has no meaning in the Cherokee language but may have come from ats\u00edla ('fire'). The Tuscaroran word for tobacco, tcrh', was glossed as 'to hold fire in the mouth', stemming from utc\u00e1r ('fire'), and this construction may be similar to that of the Cherokee. 351 Little is known about Cherokee uses of N. tabacum for medicinal purposes as most sources that discuss tobacco use among the Cherokee tend to focus on N. rustica (Mooney Witthoft claimed that the, \"gro wing of aboriginal tobaccos was uniquely the practice of pagan communities, since it is used mainly in ritual\" and that the growing of N. rustica had ceased on the reservation around 1910 (n.d.: 205). Olbrechts found N. rustica to be so scarce in 1926 that smoking mixtures contained only about 10% of it and 90% ordinary tobacco (Mooney and Olbr echts 1932: 75). It is not known if N. tabacum was considered a suitable substitute for N. rustica or if it replaced it for medicinal purposes after its extinction. Ol brechts made one clear reference to tobacco as a treatment for headaches ( aniskoli ada n\u00f6woti - 'to cure headache'), but in one place he identifies it as N. rustica (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932:171) and later refers to it as ordinary chewing tobacco (Mooney and Olbrec hts 1932: 289). So it is not clear which Nicotiana species was considered efficacious for headaches or if both were considered acceptable. ts\u00e2l\u00e2 akay\u00fbl - 'old and gay\u00fbnli to signify 'old' tobacco, but did not explain the difference. But he did explain that akay\u00fbl was from kay\u00fblige ('old'), and that this adjective may have been added after its replacement by N. tabacum . While the origin of N. rustica and the time of its introduction into eastern North America is a source of debate (Heiser 1992), the Cher okee considered it to be their original tobacco and the tobacco that they used in ceremony and medicine (Ethridge 1978). 352 The use of N. rustica is well documented in Creek ceremonies, especially the Green Corn Ceremony or busk (Swanton 1938: 546-614); however its use among the Cherokee is not as evident. There is menti on of the use of \"old tobacco\" in Cherokee ceremonies in the Payne/Butrick papers, but it is not clear if it is a species of Nicotiana . It was described as, \"a weed, supposed to resemble in some respects tobacco (Payne n.d.: 79)\", but this is not a clear identification for N. rustica . Witthoft (1949) also pointed out that, prior to recording the Cher okee ceremonies, Daniel Butrick had been a missionary at Chickamauga, a mixed town of Creek, Cherokee, and Shawnee peoples, among others. It is possible that his rendition of the ceremonies was a conflation of the various groups he observed. French naturalist Palisot De Beauvois may have been the first to record a Cherokee medicinal use for tobacco, finding that chewed tobacco was placed on a snakebite to counteract the poison (Anderson 1984). But it was Mooney who stressed the importance of N. rustica to the Cherokee: Tobacco was used as a sacred incense or as the guarantee of a solemn oath in nearly every important function - in binding the warrior to take up the hatchet against the enemy, in ratifying the treaty of peace, in confirming sales or other engagements, in seeking omens for t he hunter, in driving away witches or evil spirits, and in regular medical practi ce. It was either smoked or sprinkled on the fire, never rolled into cigarettes, as among the tribes of the Southwest, neither was it ever smoked for the mere pleasure of the sensation (Mooney 1900: 424). 353 Nicotiana rustica was also used with other remedies to counter sicknesses sent by friends or rival conjurers to test the knowledge of a medicine man (Mooney 1891: 369) (see ts\u00e2liy\u00fast usd\u00edga above). Olbrechts elaborated on the use of t obacco as a prophylactic against the influence of witches (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 75). Finely crushed tobacco was sprinkled on a cone of hot ashes to determine which direction a witch might attack from or if a witch was already in the building. The medicine man might also walk around the house and blow tobacco smoke in all direct ions that a witch might approach from, including into the sky and toward the ground. Several applications of N. rustica were published in The Swimmer Manuscript . The juice of chewed tobacco was blown on to patients suffering from unawasti egwa ('big chill') (1932:170) and was held in the mouth of the medicine man when he sucked the poison out of a snakebite (1932: 241). Nicotiana rustica could be combined with Panax quinquefolium and used on patients who had suffered a stroke (1932: 230) or chewed and rubbed on bean-like boils when the swelling first appears (1932: 301). t\u00fbks\u00fbna - turnip - Brassica napus L. The folk generic t\u00fbks\u00fbna appears to be an opaque, proper name for the turnip. Mooney also recorded the synonym ul ('round tuber'), but this name appears to refer only to the tuberous root. Mooney did not ment ion the relationship with the folk generic, t\u00fbks\u00fbn ul\u00eds , but it seems likely that the introduced turnip replaced the native 354 peppergrass in importance as the Cherokee embraced agriculture. However, applying a familial term recognized the botanical relationship between peppergrass - 'bean' - Phaseolus spp is the folk generic for beans and bean-like plants and it appears to be an opaque, proper name. The folk generic wa s applied singularly to species of Phaseolus , such as Phaseolus vulgaris L., which would include such varieties as pinto or kidney beans, or Phaseolus lunatus L., known as lima or butter beans (Goodwin 1977: 52). Phaseolus lunatus may have been introduced from South America soon after contact rather than being developed in the Southeast (W itthoft n.d.: 52). Other bean-like plants and peas were labeled as folk varieties of t\u00faya and will be individually discussed below. The association of beans and corn played a central role in Cherokee myth and nutrition, as well as in the ecology of their gardens. The first woman, Selu, who introduced corn to the Cherokee, was also the source of the first beans (Mooney 1900: 244). It is also common knowledge that beans ar e high in lysine, the limiting amino acid in grains, and provided the complement nece ssary to furnish all the essential amino acids in a corn-based diet. Beans were also planted in the same hills as corn and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with t he roots of beans provided a boost to the heavy-feeding corn plants (Goodwin 1977: 52). Witthoft (n.d: 200) said the Cherokee mostly ate there beans in three ways: immature green beans, dried beans, and bean bread. The immature green beans were boiled and further cooked in heated grease. T hey could also be strung and dried in the sun for winter consumption. The half-ripe beans were boiled and eaten or pounded in a 355 mortar into the bean bread. The dried, matu re beans were either shelled by hand or placed in a sack, beat with a stick, and the shells separated in a winnowing basket. t\u00faya an\u00edlad\u00edsk - 'bean, long tuber' - The specific qualifier an\u00edlad\u00edsk ('long tuber') was descriptive of the subterranean legume of the peanut plant. Only a passing m ention is made of the introduction of the peanut to the Cherokee (Goodwin 1977; 128) so we know little about their cultural importance. It appears that peanuts were intr oduced to Europe and the Far East by the Portuguese in the early 16 th century (Baker 1965: 57), but it is unclear how they were introduced to the Cherokee. t\u00faya unsdiga - 'little The specific unsdiga in an irregular plural form of usd\u00edga ('small') and here was used to refer to the size of the bean. Cowpeas were introduced by the Spanish and have been found with other Spanish artifacts in an archaeological site in central Alabama, indicating that they were grown there in the mid-seventeeth century (Davis 2000: 50). Cowpeas were used by the Cherokee in the same manner as other beans and peas. t\u00faya usd\u00edga - 'small bean' - Pisum pea The specific qualifier usd\u00edga ('small') was used in the singular form for P. sativum to distinguish it from the black-eyed bean. It could also be used in its abbreviated form, 356 t\u00fayusd\u00ed . The synonym unats\u00fbtal or unatl\u00fbtal ('they are upright against or supported by something') was also used and referred to the practice of supporting the pea vines on dead branches. Peas were an early introduction through Spanish contact and were observed growing in Native American gardens in Florida as early as 1562 (Davis 2000 51). Mooney said that many Cherokee w ould not eat garden peas. However, he gave no reason for this. uds\u00edla or udsil\u00fb - 'flower or bloom' - Gossypium herbaceum L. - cotton The name was in reference to the boll of the cotton plant, not the flower itself. This may have referred to the spines on the boll (see next entry) and been a reference to the pain associated with touching the boll. Mooney did not discuss the role of cotton in Cherokee life and there is no in formation on its medicinal value. udsil\u00fb - 'it smarts' - Capsicum annuum L. - red pepper The folk generic udsil\u00fb stems from udsilist ('it is smarting'), referring to the pungent flavor of red peppers. Mooney said t he following about the resemblance to the previous name, \"This name differs from that of cotton only in accent, a variation too slight to be indicated.\" No other information was available for C. annuum . ul\u00e2 - sunflower - Helianthus annuus L. The name ul\u00e2 appears to be a proper, opaque name for the sunflower. The plant was domesticated within the present boundaries of the continental United States 357 and the use of the seeds and their extr acted oil has been documented among Native Americans, but there is little explicit in formation on Cherokee use for the seeds. un\u00fbguhist - 'they leak' - Lycopersicon esculentum Miller - tomato The folk generic un\u00fbguhist was the same as the name for the ground cherry, also in the family Solanaceae with a recogni zed edible fruit (see Part 3). This appears to be a case where the introduced food was not gi ven cultural preference over the native food, nor was it designated by a special qual ifying adjective. Perhaps the cool mountain climate prevented tomatoes from thriving as they do in other portions of the Southeast and limited their use among the Cherokee. utsal\u00e9st - 'it is sticky' - Triticum aestivum L. - wheat The folk generic utsal\u00e9st refers to the dough, which goes by the same name. This quality would have been especially obvious to the Cherokee, who were more accustomed to corn flour. The gluten in wheat gives it that sticky quality that is desired in bread making, but the gluten protein is absent from corn. The Cherokee did not adopt the growing of wheat until the early 19 th century, when they incorporated the use of the plow into their farming practices (Goodwin 1977: 129). uts\u00edts\u00fbnah\u00edta - 'long tassel' - Secale cereale L. name stems from uts\u00edtsat ('tassel') and g\u00fbnih\u00edta ('long') and refers to the awns on the end of the grain. Mooney actually identified this as Lolium perenne L., or rye-grass, but this is not the edible species of rye. While the history of the use of rye 358 among the Cherokee is poorly documented, wh ite farmers in western North Carolina grew large amounts for use as both human and animal food (Davis 2000: 143). 359 Chapter 10 Cherokee Ethnomycology There is surprisingly little informati on available on the relationship of the Cherokee to the local fungi given both the variety of shapes and color as well as the large number of useful species that are available in the region. The extensive investigations into the Cherokee's use of plants for food (Perry 1974, Witthoft n.d.) and medicine (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932, Banks 1953) provide only a glimpse into the potential edible and medicinal species. T he ideal environmental conditions of the southern Appalachian region, including abundant moisture, favorable soil conditions, and a wide variety of conifers and hardwoods, are most conducive to fungal growth and species diversity. Even the casual observer will notice an array of shapes and colors that are indicative of the region's fungal diversity. Several factors may have led to the lack of information on Cherokee use of fungi. Europeans and their descendents are believed to harbor a cultural mycophobia (Morris 1987), which may have led to an oversight of fungi by the researchers. Field identification takes extensive training, as ev idenced by the few taxa identified even to or beyond the biological rank of genus, and the difficulty of preserving fungi may have prevented their transfer to experts for identific ation. It may be that of the Cherokee were truly indifferent toward their local fungi, alt hough I find this to be unlikely, given the close 360 association of the Cherokee with so many aspec ts of their biotic environment, as well as the perceptual salience and potential utilit y of the larger fungal species. Mooney noted several aspects of the classi fication of fungi, but extracting a clear system from his notes is difficul t. For instance, he indicates that taw\u00e1l (he also spells it taw\u00e1l\u00fb ) is the generic term for several varietie s of mushrooms, excluding the puffballs. In most instances when Mooney has referred to a generic name, he is referring to what a life-form category, but it is not clear whether this is a folk life-form category or a folk genus. At various points in his notes he refers to taw\u00e1l as mushrooms, fungi in general, and toadstools, a descriptive term usually reserved for the classic umbrella shaped fungi. He also used a similar term, tiw\u00e1l ('bowl') as the name used for bowl-like objects such as red raspberries (see tiw\u00e1l in the chapter on Shrubs and Vines), but Witthoft claimed that this was an inclusive name for all bowl-shaped objects including mushrooms (n.d.: 42). Not all the fungi identified as a type of taw\u00e1l, such as those in the genus Clavaria , have this prototypical mushroom shape. This makes it difficult to discern the inclusiveness of the taw\u00e1l category, but the inclusion of the genus Clavaria suggests a life form category exclusive of puffballs. The information on puffballs is too li mited to discern whether the Cherokee considered them a distinct life form from other fungi. However, Mooney's note that taw\u00e1l excluded puffballs suggested that they were considered as a distinct category. The majority of them are considered as a type of nkw's ('star'). If a more inclusive life- form term for puffballs did (or does) exist, then nkw's would appear to be an intermediate category or a folk generic. 361 Another problem is the case of ws, which Mooney reported as a type of puffball and which appears to be a shortened version of nkw's. However, later researchers have identified ws as non-puffball species (Perry 1974, Witthoft n.d.). As these researchers were among the Cherokee several decades after Mooney, this may represent a loss of traditional know ledge and a degradation of the biological classification system. For the purpose of th is work, the fungi reported used by the Cherokee by various researchers will be divided into the inclusive categories of taw\u00e1l and nkw's and the various ws will be included under both headings depending on their identification as a biological genus or species. Table 10.1. Fungus Index: Botanical Species and Folk Species Botanical Species 58) provided this name and gloss for the morels, but gave no further information about them. Perry (1974: 31) reported that Morchella esculenta Pers. ex StAmans was known to grow under apple trees and was prized by the Cherokee for its flavor. They would split tem in half or l eave them whole, roll them in meal, and fry them. anidzistez\u00ed - 'they are red' or (Fr.) S. F. Gray - orange-latex milky Witthoft recorded the name and identif ied this fungus, but gave no other information. The gloss 'they are red' most likely comes from the orange latex that is apparent when the flesh is broken. As the specif ic epithet indicates, this is a delectable edible (Fischer and Bessette 1992: 62). an\u00edl - 'they are climbing' - Auricularia spp. - wood ear Mooney described this fungus, commonly known as the wood ear, as \"a small semicircular fungus growing on rotten limbs.\" They were washed several times until the water was clear and boiled in soup with sal t. They were also eaten raw by hunters who would break them off the limbs and eat them. 363 gatu anitsutsa - 'young boy's bread' - (not identified) No is available. s\u00fbnkt - 'apple' - Exobasidium rhododendri (Fuckel) Cramer - azalea apple Witthoft described this commonly found growing on Rhododendron periclymenoides (Michaux) Shinners, thusly: The peculiar little ball-shaped or scale-like green excrescences which are found on the stems of this shrub are considered a great delicacy, and are generally called s\u00fbnkt, which is also the word for the cultivated apple. These peculiar growths are much relished as a food and a thirst-quencher by hunters (Witthoft n.d.: 55). taw\u00e1l gigag\u00e9 - 'red toadstool' - (not further information is available. taw\u00e1l g\u00fbnag\u00e9 - 'black toadstool' - (not identified) No further information is available. taw\u00e1l tsiy\u00fast - 'poplar fungus' - (not identified) Tsiy is the Cherokee name for Liriodendron tulipifera L., the tulip or yellow poplar, and \u00fast glosses as 'adhering or sticking to'. Mooney describes this fungus as having a strong stalk, flat top, being about four inches in diameter, and growing on poplar stumps. The description matches that of the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus 364 ostreatus Fries, a common edible mushroom in the mountains that is most commonly found on L. tulipifera. If Mooney had mentioned the placement of the stalk, or stipe, there would have been little doubt, as the oyster mushroom has a short, lateral stalk. taw\u00e1l uniy\u00e2at - 'branching fungus' - Clavaria spp. Members of the genus Clavaria are often referred to as coral fungi, due to branching pattern that resembles coral asse mblages. Members of this genus were also known as taw\u00e1l uwads\u00edstat or 'rough fungus' because the branches have a rough appearance. taw\u00e1l usku\u00e2l\u00fb - 'paunch fungus' - (not identified) The underside is said to resemble the inner surface of a paunch (cow's stomach). One of Mooney's informants sugges ted it might be the same fungus that he knew of as \u00faninagw\u00e1 , or 'they are crows'. This fungus was about three inches across with a red-brown underside and was eaten raw with a little salt. This suggests Fistulina hepatica Schaeff ex Fr., the beefsteak fungus (see ws below). It is called the beefsteak fungus because of its pinkish red flesh and gelatinous consistency. The underside is often reddish brown and consists of individual tubes that may be said to resemble the paunch of an animal (Miller 1978: 274). It is commonly found on oak and chestnut tress, the latter being common in the region when M ooney was among the Cherokee. It is also one of the few fungi that are recommended as safe to consume uncooked (Fischer and Bessette 1992: 127). 365 t\u00fbsk tsunhygst - 'terrapins eat it' - (not identified) The name is a combination of t\u00fbsk or 'terrapin' and tsunhygst or 'they are eating it,' but there is no indication of whic h species this was or whether the Cherokee ate it. unlagw or unlagw\u00fb - 'mushroom' - Agaricus campestris Fr. and other Agaricus species This is the common meadow mushroom, perhaps the best known of wild edible species in North America (Fischer and Besse tte 1992: 38). Mooney also reports it as tsul\u00e1gw or tsun\u00edlagw , both plural forms of unlagw, because single specimens are rarely found . Witthoft (n.d.: also identified this as Agaricus (Psalliota ) campestris , but his version of the 30) recorded unilukwe as Armillariella (Armillaria) mella commonly as the honey mushroom or \"slicky mushrooms\" by the Cherokee. They were boiled or soaked in vinegar before cooking and preserved by canning. wan\u00e9 ay\u00fbhih - 'it grows into hickory' - (not identified) This is the fungus reported to grow in dead hickory. The informant reported that it was this fungus, not that growing in black locu st, that was used to start fires. The fungus would be held under the flint when it was st ruck (Mooney). However, Witthoft (n.d.: 154) claims that the rope-like mycelium of the fungus that grows in black locust was the \"spunk\" used by the Cherokee to transport fire to a new location and to ritually \"steal\" fire during the ball-play dance. He describes it as, \"a felt-like cylinder a fourth to a half- 366 inch in diameter, enclosed in a papery cortex, wh ich is split out of the wood in strings of two to three feet long.\" ws - no gloss Witthoft (n.d.: 57) claims that ws is the proper name (a term he uses to represent opaqueness in a folk genus) for the beefsteak fungus, Fistulina hepatica , also known as the \"wood fungus\" by the Cher okee because it grows on oak stumps and trunks. Banks (1953: 1) reported that is was eaten by the Cherokee and had a taste reminiscent of beef. Perry (1974: 31) recorded Grifola (Polyporus) frondosa (frondosus) as ws and also said it grew on old stumps. Also known as \"hen of the woods\" or maitake in Japan, is commonly found growing at the base of oak trees (Fischer and Bessette 1992: 118). Maitake means \"dancing mushroom\" in Japanese, because the finder was said to be overcome with joy at finding the fungus. It is considered a choice edible and has been shown to exhibit a wide range of pharmaco logical properties including reducing blood pressure, exhibiting a hepatoprotective effect, lowering blood glucose levels in tests with diabetic rats, promoting immune function, and inhibiting tumor growth (Hobbs1995: 111- 112). Perry reported that ws were ground up with pumpkin seeds and used in soups or preserved by drying, canning, or freezing. 367 Nkw's - Puffballs dudusi - no gloss - Bovista pila Berk. and Curt. Dudusi is a used with Pinus pungens and Sassafras albidum for a form of cancer known as adayeski ('eating itself'). Mooney also mentioned this fungus, but did not identify it or provide any use for it. He reported that it was the \"ordinary\" puffball and was not eaten. He said it was also known as dudusi tuwal h or dudusi taw\u00e1l , causing further confusion determining the taw\u00e1l. nkw's tsund\u00ed-ga - \"small from ('stars') and tsund\u00ed-ga , the plural form of usd\u00ed- ga ('small'), due to their resemblance to cluste rs of stars. Banks (1953: 1) recorded the small puffballs as nakwisiusd\u00ed and identified them as Lycoperdon pyriforme Persoon. The spores from dried puffballs were dust ed on to old sores. Hobbs (1995: 19) claims that puffballs were universally used by Native Americans as a styptic, for starting fires, and as an incense to ward off malicious spirits. nkw's \u00fatana - \"large stars\" -(not identified) These puffballs are about six inches in diameter and could be any of several species of large puffballs found in the North Carolina mountains. 368 nkw's udigido - \"star's excrement\" - Geastrum spp. Commonly known as earthstars, the gloss for the Cherokee name is quite descriptive of these little ear th-bound stars. The spores of nkw's udigido were placed on the umbilical cord of newborn infants until it fell off. Olbrechts claims this is done for both prophylactic and therapeutic purpos es (Mooney and Olbrechts - Lycoperdon spp. Mooney described ws as a large, round fungus, six to twelve inches in diameter, which was good to eat when cooked like cabbage with gravy. Many of the large puffballs are considered delectable edibles. 369 Chapter 11 Re-evaluation of the Cherokee Ethnom edical System from an Ethnobotanical Perspective It is apparent from the acquired data of t he various researchers that there was a significant change in scope of Cherokee ethnobotanical knowledge between 1885 and 1977. Mooney and Olbrechts worked almost excl usively with medicine men, but they also included a few Cherokee midwives. These tr ibal experts on medical practices tribal experts on medical practices tended to be i ndividuals with specialized plant knowledge. By the time of Banks' research in t he early 1950s, there appeared to be a transition from a magico-religious approach to more of a system based on folk cures. These cures may have been extant for some time, but we re not considered as valuable as the knowledge of the specialists. Banks often cites Will West Long, who had served as an interpreter of both language and culture for Mooney and Olbrechts, as well as working extensively with Witthoft. However, Long died in 1947 (Wittho ft 1948), five years before Banks did his research, so the appearance of the continuity of research is misleading. Long was familiar with a great many of the belie fs and practices surrounding the traditional medical practices; however, he was more of an interpreter of the traditional knowledge than he was a medical practitioner (Fogels on 1961). While the range of application of plant medicines is still evident and oft en expanded in Banks' work, knowledge of the 370 symbolic significance and evocative power of plants used in formulas appears to have been diminishing. I do not mean to suggest that there we re no medicine men remaining among the Eastern Cherokee after the 1940s. While al l but two of the medicine men that had worked with Mooney had died by 1904 (Mooney 1982b), Fogelson (1961) found medicine men (or conjurers) practicing thei r trade in the late 1950s. But he also found that the integration of Christianity into C herokee society was diminishing the status of the medicine men and many forms of c onjuring were no longer practiced. Another difference between Banks' work and the work of previous researchers that demonstrates a loss of ethnobotanical knowledge was the simplification of the remedies recorded by Banks. Most of the ent ries that were exclusively attributed to Banks' informants were based on single remedies or combinations of two herbs, rarely were any used in combinations of more than two. Olbrechts claimed that combinations of four or seven herbs produced the i deal formula (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 54), these being the sacred numbers of the Cherok ee. Most of the medical formulas he recorded contained at least two plants and one formula contained as many as 24 ingredients (although most of t he ingredients had been forgotten). There were several discrepancies between Olbrechts' statements in The Swimmer Manuscrip t and the data in his and Mooney's notes. For instance, the statement cited above about using four or sev en plants in a formula is not supported by Olbrechts' notes. Combinations of four or seven herbs tend to be the exception rather than the rule (see Cherokee Ethnobotanica l Conditions in the appendix). Mooney's archival materials dispute another of Olbrechts' statements about the Cherokee 371 medicine men. He proposed that the medici ne men rarely stored herbal materials for future use and that it was, \"rare to fi nd medicine men endowed with enough foresight to lay out a garden of medicinal plants as di d the European monks in the Middle Ages (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 55).\" But in Mooney's field notebooks, he ment ions at least 30 herbaceous plants or roots that were dried for winter use and at least 15 others that were gathered in the winter either by recognizing the dri ed, above-ground portions or because they had persistent, evergreen leaves (n.d.c, Ms. 1894). The number of evergreen species would have been even greater if Mooney had included t he ferns, but it appears he took this information for granted in his notes. If the barks of trees and shrubs, which would have been recognizable and available throughout the year , are also taken into consideration, the Cherokee would have had access to a sizeable pharmacopoeia available at any time of the year. Olbrechts used Mooney's materials as a foundation for his research, but it appears that he only had access to a portion of Mooney's notes when he made his observation on the foresight of the medicine men. It is difficult to discern from the data whether the ecological changes in the Southern Appalachians were reflected in Cherokee ethnobotanical knowledge. The perspectives on the use of tree species by the Cherokee provided by Mooney and Olbrechts seem to be the inverse of the hist ory of forest use. One might expect that trees would play a diminishing role in m edicine and ceremony as the commercial value of timber rose and the forests were remo ved by logging interests. However, Mooney rarely discussed the medicinal uses of trees and in his notes he focused his attention on the linguistic analysis of the tree names. Olbrechts' research in 1926-1927 came 372 towards the end of the intensive logging period, but it is through his research that we can view the cultural importance of tree spec ies, especially in relationship to Cherokee ethnomedical practices. He often gave several uses for an individual species and many of the medicinal formulas contained the bar k or roots of several tree species. When shrubs and woody vines are considered in th is context, the range of medicinal woody species is truly impressive. This is especia lly obvious in the formulas included in the appendix (see Cherokee Ethnomedical Conditions). The value of medicinal tree use becomes very clear when we consider the frequency of remedies selected for the various Cherokee ethnomedical conditions (Table 1). Each remedy was noted for its use as a single remedy or its inclusion in a formula for the most common ethnomedical c onditions. These were then listed in rank order starting with the remedies with the most applications. What becomes clear from this figure is that woody species were di sproportionately represented in the selection process. Of the 55 plant species represented here that had five or more applications, 18 were trees and 31 were woody species, including shrubs and vines. When the total number of applications is tallied, tree specie s were selected for a total of 136 uses out of a total of 378 possible selections (36% of all selections). When all woody species are considered, they were selected 234 times (62%), while herbaceous plants were selected 144 times (38%). Woody plants were nearly twice as likely to be selected as remedies as herbaceous plants. To rework an old adage, it is likely that Mooney did not, \"see the trees for the forest.\" European and early American herbal tr aditions were dominated by the use of herbaceous plants and the relevance and range of tree use by the Cherokee may have 373 simply been overlooked. In The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees he neglected tree species in his list of selected plant spec ies used for medicinal purposes (1891: 324-327) and included only one formula where tree specie s were the dominant medicines (356). In Myths of the Cherokee , he devotes two pages to trees in his section on plant lore (1900: 421-422) but this mostly concerns beliefs surrounding trees and there is little included concerning their therapeutic potential. Table 11.1. Frequency of Remedy Selection for Cherokee Diseases Plant Name Frequency Plant Name 12 12 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 Contemporary studies have shown this to be an egregious oversight. In his meta- analysis of Native North American medicinal plants, Moerman ( 1991) found that the 374 frequency of use of trees and shrubs as medicinal agents was disproportionately represented when compared with the expected fr equency of the use of other life forms. The barks of tree species are known to contain a wide range of pharmacologically active compounds (Turner and Hebda 1990), some with strong antioxidant (McCune and Johns 2002) and antimicrobial activity (Omar et al. 2000). It is fortunate for the student of Native American ethnobotany that Olbrechts revisited Mooney's work among the Cherokee. Had this not been the case, much of the rich association of the Cherokee with the forests that surrounded them w ould have gone unrecorded. It is only through the records of both men, especially in light of those of later researchers, that we begin to approach the relevance of tree species to the Cherokee. There is some evidence of a humoral element in the Cherokee ethnomedical system, but it does not comply with the curr ently accepted focus on hot/cold, dry/moist dichotomies (Jackson 2001). The concept of heat balancing cold is barely mentioned in the Cherokee literature, mostly in the form of the spirit of fire being invoked to counter the diseases caused by cold blooded animals or spirits that rule the elements of cold (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 21). Countering moist with dry is also touched upon with the avoidance of wet, fleshy fruits and vegetables when one was blisters caused from exposure to the sun (Mooney and Olbrecht s 1932: 211). But these concepts do not appear to be infused throughout the Cherokee syst em in the same manner as they are in Greek, Ayurvedic, and Chinese humoral systems (Foster 1994: 4-12). Their place in Cherokee medicine was not noted by any of the ethnographers. When I speak of humoral medicine in t he Cherokee system, I am referring to the humors themselves, the bodily fluids that were considered the basis of physiological 375 balance in the Hippocratic medical writings (Jackson 2001). In the Hippocratic corpus, the four humors were blood, phlegm, black bi le, and yellow bile. The fluids mentioned as being \"of capital importance in human ph ysiology\" from the Cherokee perspective were quite similar: saliva, blood, and bi le (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 15). However, from an ethnobotanical perspective, I would add ur ine to that list. I will discuss saliva, blood, and bile first, as they were cit ed by Olbrechts, and then demonstrate the importance of urine. Saliva In the Kilpatricks' study of love formulas of the western band of the Cherokee, they claim that the ancestral Cherokee considered sa liva, not blood, as the original vital fluid (Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick 1965: 25). Joining sa liva with another person was considered to have a powerful bonding influence. They site as evidence two formulas that list the attributes that the desirous one must symbol ically consume or possess in order to control the affections of the intended. The a ttributes are listed in descending order in the lines of the prayer and, according to the Kilpatricks, the Cherokee \"gamut of values\" suggests that the attribute with lowest priori ty or value was stated first and that with the highest priority or value was the last one stated. One of the formulas was glossed thusly: Now! Ha! Very quickly I a have just come to take away your heart. Ha! Very quickly I have just come to take away your thought. Ha! Very quickly I have just come to take away your breath. 376 Ha! Very quickly I have just come to take away your saliva (Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick 1965: 115). In another example, the order of attributes was soul, flesh, and saliva (Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick 1965: 114). This suggests the prima cy of saliva over the other attributes. However, they are at a loss to explain two other prayers which suggest a different perception of values; one listing the attri butes of heart, breath, saliva, and blood and the other saliva and soul (Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick 1965: 116-117). While it is clear from the above discussi on that saliva was an important component of the Cherokee ethnomedical system, it is not cleat that it was of paramount importance. Olbrechts' observation that the Cherokee considered the state of the saliva to be, \"as important as the blood and the gall\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 15) suggests that the hierarchy of value of thes e bodily fluids was lateral and flexible. The remainder of this discussion will also dem onstrate that the primacy of a fluid was context dependent. The variations in the formul as or prayers collected by the Kilpatricks also support this view. It may have been that saliva was a primary consideration because it was more accessible to the physician than blood or bile and easier to obtain for the perpetrator of an act of conjuring. There were several diagnostic features of the state of the saliva, but the most important was the concept of \"spoiled saliva \". Saliva could be spoiled in many ways: ghosts, dreaming of snakes, having snak e poison put in one's food, pregnancy, emotional upset, and dreaming of the dead all spoiled the saliva (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). Dreams of the bite of a snake were consider ed detrimental to the health of the patient 377 and were treated as seriously as an actual bite because it could cause the spoiling of saliva (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 176). Olbr echts described the state of spoiled saliva from dreaming of fish as tasti ng different, getting thick, and possibly changing color to white or yellow (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). The affliction associated with spoiled saliva was quite serious. A Cherokee who had spoiled saliva was thought to become, \"despondent, withers away, and dies\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 15). The primary therapy used to treat spoi led saliva was emesis. Emesis, when applied to spoiled saliva, was seen not so much as a way to cleanse the alimentary tract, but as a means to throw off corrupted saliva (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 83). The range of medicinal plants used to treat t he condition was specific to the cause of the affliction. When a conjurer spoiled the saliva, one of the primary remedies was the emetic herb Lobelia inflata (Mooney Ms. 1894). A decoction of Dioscorea villosa was used as an emetic for spoiled saliva caused by ghosts, dreams of snakes, or when snake poison was put in food. Large quantitie s of a tea of the leaves and stems of Solanum ptycanthum was drunk every four days as an emetic to clear the spoiled saliva caused by mourning the death of a loved one (Banks 1953: 115-116). For saliva spoiled from dreaming of the dead, a decoction of Polygonatum biflorum and some soil dug from the front of a ground hog's den was drunk for four straight mornings, the patient vomiting until all the liquid was expelled, (Banks 1953: 16). Once spoiled saliva was deposited in the river through emesis, t he disease was transported downstream and away from the patient (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 23). Spoiling was not the only condition associat ed with saliva. It was also associated with the act of conjuring. Witches and mankille rs could transform their saliva into spirit 378 insects that would inflict diseases on their intended targets (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). Securing the spittle of a victim would also give the conjurer power over that person. Cicuta maculata was used for a conjuring ceremony that was intended to take the life of a victim. The conjurer would take the spittle of his intended victim and mix it with several crushed earthworms and some splinters from some lightening struck wood. He would then put the paste in a joint of the stem of C. maculata and ceremonially buries it. If all goes to plan, the victim dies within seven days. A conjurer could also change a person's saliva, causing it to be a place w here insects would breed or food, such as corn, would sprout (Mooney 1891: 392-393). The influential power of a person's saliva was also evident in conjuring involving love and romance. Obtaining the spittle of the object of one's affection was considered a necessary ingredient in love charms (Mooney 1891: 392-393). A new husband or wife would also fix the affections of their mate on their first night together by rubbing spittle on the breast of the other while re citing a formula (Mooney 1891: 381). Other ethnomedical conditions associat ed with saliva were excessive and deranged saliva. Caused by dreams of snakes or mud turtles, Cherokee physicians treated excessive saliva much as they did s poiled saliva, with an emetic. A decoction of the roots of Prunella vulgaris was drunk for four consecutive mornings while abstaining from salt (Mooney Ms. 1894). Along with being used for \"spoiled saliva\", a species of Oxalis was used for a condition known as \"disordered saliva\" (Banks 1953: 75). The informant was clear that the two conditions were not the same, and that the symptoms of \"disordered saliva\" included dryne ss and a bitter taste in the mouth. 379 Saliva was also a medium used to administer an herbal remedy. When a ghost caused a sharp pain in the chest, the medicine man would chew a ginseng root, Panax quinquefolium , and rub the mixture of root and sa liva on the chest of the patient (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). While it is clear from the above di scussion that saliva was an important diagnostic tool for the Cherokee physicians, it is not clear that it was of paramount importance. Olbrechts' observation that the Cherokee considered the state of the saliva to be, \"as important as the blood and the gall\" (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 15) suggests that the hierarchy of value of thes e bodily fluids was lateral and flexible. The remainder of this discussion will also demonstrate that it was context-dependent. The variations in the formulas or prayers collec ted by the Kilpatricks also support this view. It may have been that saliva was a primary cons ideration because it was more accessible to the physician than blood or bile and easier to obtain for the perpetrator of an act of conjuring. Blood The status of the state of the blood appears to rival that of saliva in the Cherokee ethnomedical system (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 15). While the primacy of saliva was determined by its place in the Cherokee love incantations, the following formula would suggest that blood was more important than saliva: Now! Ha! Quickly I have just come to take away your heart. Ha! Quickly I have just come to take away your breath. 380 Ha! Quickly I have just come to take away your saliva. Ha! Quickly I have just come to take away your blood (Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick 1965: 116). Perdue (1998: 29) claims that blood was the \"most powerful\" of the body's substances and cites the influence of menstruating wom en as an example of the power of blood. Whatever its place in the hierarchy of val ue, the presence and constitution of a patient's blood told the Cherokee physician much about the patient's health. There were several causes that led to problems with the blood. Contact with or eating food prepared by a menstruating wom an could cause bloody emanations from the body's orifices. A wound could \"catch cold\", causing gangrene, and the resulting impure blood was thought to eat the flesh. Paralysis on one side of the body (possibly due to a stroke) was thought to be due to be caused by the blood being stopped (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). It was also necessary to respect the blood of other creatures. Desecrating blood, such as by urinating on the spot where blood has been spilled while butchering an animal, can cause a disease sim ilar to the rheumatism sent by Little Deer to hunters who have not honored the corpse of a slain deer (Mooney 1900: 251). Eating too much salt might cause the expulsion of blood and the consumption of salt was usually tabooed for a patient suffering from conditions that involved bleeding, such as menstruation, wounds, or when a patient spits blood (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 65). One of the most salient aspects in volving blood in the Cherokee ethnomedical system was menstruation. Mens truating women would isolate themselves from contact and interaction with the rest of the community during their periods. They would retreat to 381 small, isolated huts and have food left for them by non-menstruating women (Perdue 1998: 29). The menstruating woman was thought to exercise a \"nefarious\" influence on those around them, causing disease in people, interfering with the growth of crops, and disrupting the catch in fish traps by wading in the rivers. Even the woman's husband was believed to be dangerous at this time (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 34-35). Pregnancy was associated with similar taboos , but the primary condition of the blood associated with childbirth was 'she is sick with remainder' ( utigad\u00f6 uts\u00f6ya ), which was due to stagnant blood which remained after the birth of a child (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). Cherokee physicians applied techniques that directly involved interaction with blood, mainly the processes of cupping and scratching. During the cupping procedure, the medicine man scarifies the patient over the afflicted area and places the cupping implement over the freely flowing blood to remove an offending object. This usually consists of an object such as a pebble or small stick, often sent by an enemy and considered to be the source of the discomfort (Mooney 1891: 334). The cupping implement was originally a cut off buffalo horn with a buzzard's gizzard stretched over the narrow end. The medicine man would pr oduce a vacuum by sucking on the base of the implement (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 73). Scratching involved making abrasions on the skin using a special scratching implement. These implements were made of bone, briars, flint, or snake's teeth. Mooney observed that the scratching often drew blood (1891: 334) but Olbrechts found that the procedure had changed and the scratches were rarely deep enough to draw blood (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 69). Herbal preparations were then applied to the scratched areas, allowing for direct contac t with the bloodstream. This procedure was 382 used for applying medicine to the ballplayers in preparation for matches and for painful conditions such as rheumatism (Mooney 1891: 335). Harsh or toxic medicines that could not be taken internally were often applied topically after scratching (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 204). Certain plants were thought to affect the qual ity of the blood. A tea of the root of yellow dock ( Rumex crispus ) was given to pregnant women to facilitate labor and it was given in late pregnancy to prevent the loss of blood during childbirth. It was thought to purify the blood, especially in the spring when sores were slow to heal. Banks found that a tea of the roots of Aralia nudicaulis was considered a good blood tonic (1953: 91). Certain edible plants were also considered to have a beneficial effect on the blood. The young shoots of Phytolacca americana were eaten in the spring to cleanse and build the blood (Banks 1953: 43). Plants whose flowers were a deep red color were often associated with conditions that involved blood. Bee balm ( Monarda didyma ) and both plants with blood-red flowers, were used when blood was present in the urine and for nosebleeds (Ms. 4600). The flowers of Lysimachia quadrifolia have a red center, hence the Cherokee name gigats\u00faya-h or 'it has blood in it'. It was also used for blood in the urine. Most of the remaining medicinal plants used to treat conditions involving blood were tree species. Sassafras albidum was a favorite table beverage of the Cherokee, but it was also considered a good blood pur ifier (Banks 1953: 53). A decoction of the bark of Platanus occidentalis or ash Fraxinus americana was drunk for spitting blood. Prunus pensylvanica , Magnolia acuminata and Diospyros virginiana were all part of 383 formulas for bloody flux. Amelanchier arborea and P. pensylvanica were both used to treat blood in the urine. Bile While bile was considered one of the pr imary body fluids of the Cherokee, discussion of it was limited to one ethnomedical condition, dal\u00e2ni ('yellow'). Dal\u00e2ni takes its name from the yellow bile that was observ ed to be present in the vomit of the patient. Mooney referred to the condition as \"old bi liousness\" and ascribed it to the irregular eating habits of the Cherokee (1891: 365). While Mooney interpreted the Cherokee explanation for dal\u00e2ni as due to the revenge of the terrapin and the turtle, Olbrechts expands the explanation to include the spirits of vengeful animal spirits. These confound the bile and caused excess to collect in the veins under the navel (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 182). In his notes, Olbrecht s describes the most common symptoms of dal\u00e2ni , which include a sallowness of the face, black rings around the eyes, dark urine, and a frothy discharge from the bowels (Ms. 4600). In The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 182) he added vomiting of bile and soreness around the navel to these symptoms. Olbrechts recorded several varieties of dal\u00e2ni , most of them identified by an association with the color terms yellow, red, blue, purple, and black. He attributed the variation in color to color symbolism in stead of from the recognition of differing symptoms. However, black dal\u00e2ni is considered the most virulent manifestation of the condition and was highlighted in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 365). In this form, the symptoms were descri bed in the following manner, \"the navel and abdomen of the patient swell, the ends of his fingers become black, dark circles appear 384 about his eyes, and the throat contracts spasmodically and causes him to fall down suddenly insensible.\" If contemporary studies are considered, it is not surprising that this condition would be prevalent among the Cherokee. Biliar y diseases occur at a much higher rate among North American Native Americans t han in white populations, with the frequency among Pima women over age 25 reaching as high as 75 percent (Sievers and Fisher 1981). The factors cited as the most likely explanation for this are a combination of genetic predisposition for biliary disease and the adoption of westernized diets (Weiss et al. 1984, Shaheb 1990, Heaton 1984). Diets high in fat and refined carbohydrates coupled with a decrease in physical activity exacerbate the inherent propensity for the condition. The primary therapy for dal\u00e2ni consisted of the medicine man warming his hands by the fire and massaging the navel area of the patient. This was repeated four times between sunrise and noon (Mooney and Olbrec hts 1932: 182). Mooney claimed that herbs used to treat dal\u00e2ni often had a distinctly yellow plant part, such as the flower or the root (Mooney 1891: 323). But of the remedies recorded by him and later researchers, none had yellow flowers and only Xanthorhiza simplicissima had a distinctly yellow root. Olbrechts explained that the woody species used in the treatment of dal\u00e2ni , such as Clethra inner bark (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 218), but I have yet to verify this. The primary herbal therapy consisted of t he medicine man giving the patient a large quantity of a decoction and taking him or her to the river to expel the offending bile through emesis (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 218). The disease was not only removed 385 from the patient, but was translocat ed downstream to \"other\" people (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 23). Urine On the surface, urine does not appear to have been as important as blood, bile, or saliva as a diagnostic tool for determini ng the health of the Cherokee patient. There is no mention of it being one of the important bodily fluids . The primary discussions of urine concern broken taboos involving the ac t of urination. For instance, showing disrespect to the spirit of fire by urinati ng on it or its ashes would cause itchy genitals and accompanying sores. Urinating on anthills, on trails around the house, in the river, or on a spot where an animal has been killed will also lead to itching (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 174). Urinating in the river insu lts the spirit of the river and, along with itching, it can cause incontinence (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 23). These taboos tend to cast Cherokee attitudes toward urine in a disparaging light and suggest that urination was considered a means of desecration. Conditions involving urine in the C herokee ethnomedical system tended to be of two varieties; those that described the obser vable state of the urine such as bloody urine, yellow urine, or milky urine and those that involved the act of urination such as stopped urination, profuse urinati on, or painful urination. T he physical state of the urine is one of the most important diagnostic aspec ts of many of the world's ethnomedical systems, but little has been written about its role in the Cherokee system. Uroscopy, the analysis of urine using the senses of sight, smell, and occasionally taste, has a long history of application in ethnomedical systems. In the roots of the 386 western medical system, uroscopy came to prominence in the Byzantine Empire and remained the primary means of medical diagnosis until the refinement of the microscope and the development of chem istry in the mid-nineteenth century (Voswinckel 2000). In the Middle Ages, Eur opean physicians carried color charts of up to twenty colors that were prepared to matc h urine color to health conditions (White 1991). The condition of the urine is obser ved to analyze the state of balance of vata, pitta, and kapha, the three humors in the Ayurv edic system of India (Lad 1984: 43). Color of urine and frequency of urination ar e diagnostic tools of Traditional Chinese medicine (Yanchi 1988: 209) and in the Tibet an system the condition of the urine is considered a reflection of all disease conditions in the body (Donden 1986: 130). Conditions that involved an observable qual ity of the urine were not clearly explained by the Cherokee researchers. Ev en in his notes, Olbrechts gives little information about the condition he recorded as gig\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7a ('urinating blood'). u\u00e7a ('they urinate all milk'), he mentioned the presence of pain in the pelvis and back associated with dark red urine. While this description appears to be related to kidney stones, it does not appear to be the same condition with a substantial red colorati on in their flowers, were used to treat blood in the urine. Lindera benzoin and two species of Ilex, species that have bright red berries, were also used for bloody urine. However, 10 other plants without any red coloration were also used, indicating that color symbolism was not a requirement for remedy selection. 387 Yellow urine, known as dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a, started as excessive urine, but the flow would decrease and get more and more yellow. If the flow stopped completely, it was believed that the patient would di e. In the description of the condition g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i ('when they are eaten by them'), an associ ation was made between yellow urine with back pain, but not enough information was available to determine if this was due to kidney stones. Olbrechts described milky urine, or uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a ('if they water out white'), as an infection of kidneys. But whitish uri ne, or chyluria, is also associated with tuberculosis and diabetes (Sherman et al. 1987), two conditions that are currently problems among Native Americans (Farrell et al. 1993, Rhoades 1990). Both will be discussed below. Two species of plants with milky latex, Chamaesyce maculata and Euphorbia corollata , were used in a formula to treat milky urine. Olbrechts tried to symbolically associate these plants with milky discharges (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 180), but the majority of the other plants us ed to treat this condition did not exude milky latex. Conditions that involved the act of uri nation tended to be of a mechanical nature and remedies were chosen to bring the syst em back into balance. For instance, the straight twigs of Oxydendron arboreum were included in formulas for stopped urination because it was thought that they would stra ighten out twisted urinary passages that caused the blockage (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 222). Difficult benign hypertrophy (BPH ), an enlargement of the prostate gland (Thomas 1997: 212). While no information is available concerning the use of sourwood for BPH, Catawba women used it for menopausal symptoms (Moerman 1998: 374), 388 indicating that it may have an effect on the hormonal changes associated with BHP (McPartland and Pruitt 2000).. The condition associated with painful uri nation was poorly defined by Olbrechts, but treatment relied heavily on woody plant s pecies (Olbrechts Ms. 4600). Witthoft (n.d.: 134) mentioned that a multi-bark formula t hat was used by the Cherokee to treat gonorrhea, the primary symptom of which is an infection of the urethra that causes painful urination. The original conditi on may have been poorly defined due to modesty on the part of Olbrechts and his informants, or it may have been a general infection of the urethra. Profuse urination, believed to be caused by urinating in the river (see above), was treated with a cold infusion of Eryngium yuccifolium , commonly known as rattlesnake-master. Profuse urination is a symptom of diabetes, and Will West Long, a primary informant for researchers from James Mooney in the late 1880s through John Witthoft in the 1940s, stated that a cold infu sion of the roots and leaves of rattlesnake master was drunk to treat diabetics (Witt hoft 1946). A high incidence of diabetes was thought to be a recent phenomenon among Nati ve Americans (Weiss et al. 1989, Gohdes et al. 1993) and unknown among t he Cherokee until after 1940 (Weidman 1989). But Witthoft, who began his research among the Eastern Cherokee in the mid-1940s, found an \"exceptionally high incidence\" of the disease at that time (n.d.: 147). In a letter to Olbrechts dated Feb. 5, 1928, Dr. R. D. Holt, a white physician who had a medical practice in the town of Cherok ee beginning in 1903, stated that he treated a few cases of diabetes while practicing medicine on the reservation (Olbrechts n.d.). It would 389 appear that diabetes was known among the Cherokee for some time and it should come as no surprise that they would have remedi es for some of the accompanying symptoms. 390 Viewing the importance of bodily fl uids in Cherokee diagnosis from an ethnobotanical perspective, the status of ur ine appears to take on a more influential role. The methodology used here is similar to that used by Trotter (1981) in his evaluation of Mexican American home remedi es. Trotter assumed that people are most likely to recall the remedies that were most frequently used or had been significant in treating an illness in their own life or the life of someone close to them. The ailments that were most commonly treated with home re medies were also the most culturally salient ailments. Trotter gauged the perceptual prominence of diseases by rank ordering the most common conditions treated with home remedies. I have modified this method slightly to accommodate the ethnohistorical perspective in this work (see Table 11.2). I wi ll consider that the cultural salience of Cherokee illnesses can be inferred by the number of remedies that have been used, either singly or in formulas, to elicit a cure. Those conditions that were particularly troublesome for the Cherokee would likely have generated the most interest among them for a cure and would be represented by the application of the greatest number of remedies from the Cherokee pharmacopoeia. Comparing the number of remedies used for the various conditions, it becomes evident that the condition of the urine and ur inary tract were primary diagnostic tools of Cherokee physicians. Of the 14 conditions with 20 or more uses, three are concerned with urinary problems. In Table 11.3, I hav e isolated the conditions concerned with the different fluids to ease comparison. I hav e included only two remedies for menstrual problems because these were the only ones t hat dealt specifically with menstrual bleeding. Stroke was also considered here because the Cherokee considered it caused 391 Table 11.2. Number of Remedies Used for Cherokee Diseases Diseases Number of Remedies Used Diseases Number of Remedies Used Chills and Fever Diarrhea Coughing Menstrual Problems Yellow Urine Cancer, Gangrene, Ulcers Milky Urine Emetic for Biliousness Toothache Birth Rheumatism Painful Urination Dysentery Sore Throat Kidney trouble Pain in Stomach Disturbing Dreams Headache Scrofula Urinate Blood Back Ache Nausea Stopped Urination Spoiled Saliva Muscle Cramps Snake Bite 64 55 44 37 33 32 32 29 29 27 24 23 21 20 19 19 19 19 18 16 16 16 16 16 14 14 Thrush Eye Problems Intestinal Worms Piercing Wound Heart Attack Itching Boils and Blisters Pain in Breast Vomit Blood Children's Stomachache Measles Conjuring Blisters form Sunburn Abdominal Swelling Insect Bites Hemorrhoids Earaches Painful Memories Profuse Urination Broken Bones Yellow Mucus Diabetes Broken Bones Painful Memories Small Pox Nose Bleed 14 13 13 11 11 11 10 10 8 8 8 8 7 7 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 by the blood stopping. Bloody urine was incl uded in the urine section primarily because Olbrechts appeared to consider it a urinary c ondition, but it might also be considered in both the blood and urine categories. I have provi ded two totals: the first is the sum of all the plants used for all the conditions, the second takes into account plants that were used for more than one condition included under a bodily fluid category. The three fluids that were considered of \"capital importance\", blood, bile, and saliva, are represented by total remedy use of 31, 29, and 21 remedies, respectively. All these totals demonstrate the high degree of cult ural salience expected, considering their prominence in the Cherokee ethnomedical system . However, the condition of the urine 392 Table 11.3. Number of Herbs Used per Bodily Fluid Ethnomedical Condition Number of Herbs Used Total Total per Fluid Saliva Spoiled or Deranged Saliva Yellow Mucus Bile ( dal\u00e2ni ) Blood Bloody Diarrhea Vomit Blood Stroke Nosebleed Blood After Birth Menstrual Bleeding Urine Yellow Urine Milky Urine Painful Urination Bloody Urine Stopped Urine Profuse Urination 16 5 29 10 8 4 4 3 2 33 32 23 16 16 5 21 29 31 125 21 29 31 90 and urinary tract is represented by a total of 90 remedies, more than the sum of the other three combined. The cultural salience of urine and conditions of the urinary tract is evidenced by the concern with finding rem edies to alleviate related ethnomedical conditions. It would appear that the value of urine as a diagnostic tool was overlooked by previous Cherokee researchers. Other aspects of Table 2 reflect hist orical and contemporary trends in Native American health. Dr. R. D. Holt wrote tha t, \"the most common cases of illness among the Eastern Cherokee were colds, influenz a, pneumonia, etc. Pulmonary tuberculosis was, however, more common among the I ndians than the neighboring whites.\" The number of remedies used for chills and feve r (64) and Coughing (44) indicate that Dr. 393 Holt's perception of Cherokee illness was c ongruent with the concerns of the Cherokee physicians. The high number of cough remedies may also have been due to the prevalence of tuberculosis, which would also explain the high number of remedies for scrofula (18). Holt speculated that tuber culosis was such a problem due to \"more frequent undernourishment and exposure.\" Incidenc e of tuberculosis has remained high in the general population of Native Americans, with mortality rates three times that of the general population in the mid-1980s (Rhoades 1990). The Holt letter also indicated the need fo r the large number of diarrhea remedies (55). He wrote, \"Due to lack of sanitary priv ies, and other causes, it was the general rule for all, or practically all, the chil dren to be infested with the round worm ( Ascaris lumbricoides ).\" The same unsanitary conditions that would have led to an infestation of intestinal worms would have been conducive to rampant diarrhea. The small number of remedies applied to intestinal worms (5) was most likely due to the efficacy of available remedies than lack of concern over the condi tion. Two of the remedies for intestinal worms, Spigelia marilandica and Chenopodium ambrosioides , are well known anthelmintics and have persisted in both Native American and Euro-American folk systems. Chenopodium ambrosioides , especially the oil from the seeds, is known for its ability to expel roundworms and hookworms (Chevallier 1996:186), while Spigelia and tapeworms (Chevallier 1996: 270). The high number of remedies for rheumatis m (24) is not surprising considering the prevalence of rheumatic diseases among North American Indian groups, which tends to be higher than any other populati ons (Sievers and Fisher 1981). There is strong evidence indicating a genetic etiology for the disease (Peschken and Esdaile 394 1999), however, archaeological evidence in t he southeastern United States suggests that the transition to agriculture was a ccompanied by an increase in degenerative joint disease (Larsen 1984). The prevalence of rheumatic diseases among the Cherokee is evident through their mythology and folk etiology of the diseases. The very name associated with rheumatism, did\u00f6lesgi ('the crippler' or 'when it brea ks them'), reflects the Cherokee dread of the condition. According to the Cher okee myth of the origin of disease, the chief of the deer inflicts rheumatism on man for not asking pardon of the spirit of a deer he has killed (Mooney 1900). Other activities that were believed to cause rheumatism included incest, sexual excess, and dr eaming of the opposite sex (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 196). When afflicted with the disease, the sufferer must abstain from eating any creature that has a humped back, such as bison, rabbit, squirrel, or sunfish as well as not petting a cat or dog for f ear of aggravating the condition (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 293). Loss of agility due to rheumatism would have been especially devastating to Cherokee male identity, as the limiting of motion would have curtailed traditional male activities such as hunting, stickball, and warfare (Hudson et al. 1975). The primary treatment for rheumatism, a decoction of the roots of several species of ferns, was explained from a sym bolic perspective. The unfurling of the young fern frond was considered to be symbolic of the straightening out of a rheumatic limb (Mooney 1891: 324). However, of the 24 remedi es applied to rheumatic conditions, only two fern species, Adiantum pedatum and Polystichum acrostichoides , were clearly identified as treatments for rheumatism. The remaining remedies were selected from a variety of herbaceous and shrubby plants, few of which exhibited this unfurling quality. 395 One surprising aspect of Table 2 is the re latively few remedies for measles (8) and small pox (4). Both diseases were devas tating to New World populations after initial contact with Europeans (Cook 1998: 72) and recurring epidemics cyclically ravaged the Cherokee people. Adair found that one such small pox epidemic in 1738 killed nearly half of the Cherokee (Adair 1974: 244). Adai r (1974: 245) also reported that the epidemic had a demoralizing effect on the Cherokee physicians: ...all the magi and prophetic tribe broke their old consecrated physic-pots, and threw away all the other pretended holy things they had for physical use, imagining they had lost their divine power by being polluted... Perhaps the impotence experienced by the Cherokee physicians when treating these deadly infectious diseases translated into the relatively few remedies for either condition. A reoccurring theme in this re-eval uation of the Cherokee ethnomedical system has been the questioning of symbolism in t he selection of plant remedies. The statements about the selection of remedies for t heir color, such as yellow plant parts for biliary diseases or red flowered plants fo r conditions of the blood, or developmental properties, such as the unfurling of a fern frond for rheumatism, are specific examples that do not follow general trends. I do not mean to belittle the value of symbolic importance to the Cherokee, but I merely want to point out that it was not the primary factor in selection criteria for treatment of remedies. Mooney's disparaging statements about the efficacy of Cherokee herbal medici nes (1890 b) reflected the national trend of 396 the time away from plant based rem edies to those produced by the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry. The rising influence of the American Medical Association in the late 19th century in both academic and political circles made the rejection of botanical medicines appear both sensible and fa shionable (Griggs 1981: 233). Mooney's association with the Smithsonian Instituti on, a bastion of contemporary intellectual thought located in the heart of the American political process, would have exposed him to the medical biases of his time. As explained in the discussion of t he ethnobotanical system, Mooney was keen to demonstrate the intricacy and validity of Native American religions. He found the Cherokee ethnomedical system a rich blend of m edical practice and spiritual beliefs. But his representation of remedy selection as primarily based on symbolic criteria is not supported by the combined data of all the res earchers. As Ankli et al. (1999) found in their study of selection criteria among the Yucatec Maya, symbolic attributes appear to have been ascribed to a remedy after its efficacy had been established. Symbolic attributes can be powerful cultural mnem onic devices, that, when applied to plants, assure the transmission of acqui red medico-botanical knowledge. In this re-evaluation, I have attempted to question some of the assertions of previous researchers, highlight material that appeared to have been overlooked, and re- examine the voluminous data of all the researc hers in light of contemporary studies. My intention in doing so was not to cast the c onclusions of the previous researchers in a disparaging light. In the course of this research, I have gained a great deal of respect for Mooney, Olbrechts, and their successors. The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees and The Swimmer Manuscript were and remain some of the finest works on Native 397 American medicine that have been produc ed. I have been both astounded by the intricate details of their research and fr ustrated at cursory passages that piqued my interest. And, as with any good body of knowledge, it generates more questions than it answers, questions that are difficult to answe r in an ethnohistorical framework. My goal here is to expand perceptions of C herokee ethnomedical practices beyond the interpretations of my predecessors and add another perspective to a complex subject. 398 References Adair, James 1974 Adair's History of the American I ndians.

Many of these are described and explained in The Swimmer Manuscript , but a large portion of them are not included in that work. The description of the condition and treatments are included here as a glossary for the applications of the individual plants in the proceeding chapters. The entire selection will be included here as most were treated, at l east in part, with herbal medicines. Each includes, when available, the Cherokee name fo r the condition, its gloss, a description of the condition, the cause of the condition, and the treatment regime as recorded by Olbrechts. Many have several combinations of plant-based remedies applied as a part of the cure. While I refer to these combinations of herbal remedies as formulas, it must be clarified that they are different from t he sacred formulas recorded by Mooney. Mooney's sacred formulas often describe the combinati ons of herbs in their text, but they are predominantly prayers or incantations that were recited while attending to an illness. Mooney considered them to be an indication of the presence of a religion among Native Americans, refuting the assertions of thos e who doubted that any true religion was in existence (Mooney 11891: 318). Olbrechts expanded the Cherokee medical treatments beyond the formulas in his research and recorded a wider range of the non-herbal 411 treatments used for the various conditions as well as lists of herbs used singly or in combination to treat the different ethnomedical conditions. aalugi sak oni - 'the blue whirlwind' This condition was caused by the spir it of the North Wind. The symptoms included a headache and a head cold. It was treated by invocation to the spirit of the wolf and the blowing of breath. adayunitil\u00f6 - 'pierced by wood' This is caused by someone being pierced by a stick or a wood splinter. If the treatment is immediate, no taboo is necessary . However, if the treatment is the next day, the patient must abstain from salt and hot food for the next four days. An infusion of the following herbs was placed on the w ound as a poultice with warmed if there is pain in different places' Caused by witches or ghosts, this can manifest as either acute rheumatism or nervous collapse. Olbrechts claimed that these types of conditions were the most dreaded of the Cherokee diseases (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 33). One mode of treating the condition consisted of the m edicine man simply warming his hands in a ceremonial way and rubbing the patient at the si te of their pain. Another consisted of a warm infusion of the 412 medicine man places in his mouth and sucks the afflicted area, spitting the liquid into a waiting bowl. The offending object sent by the human or disincarnate agent was often found in the liquid. The ceremony was repeat ed up to four times, until the offending object materialized (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 216). adayeski or atayesgi - 'eating itself' This refers to cancer, ulcers, or gangrene. There were several causes for this condition. Insects of different kinds, such as bees, could cause a sore that would not heal. Also, a wound could \"catch cold\" causing gangrene and impure blood was thought to eat the flesh. There were several treatments for adayeski. The barks of Diospyros virginiana and Acer ruburm were boiled and rubbed on a wound, as well as blown onto the wound. No salt or hot food were taken for four days. The bark of Carya tomentosa was chewed and the juice blown on the wound. This was considered a universal panacea for all wounds. The bark of Platanus occidentalis was boiled down and the decoction rubbed on the infected area. The tea was then wiped off and crushed, dried bark was sprinkled into the wound. A decoction of violet root s was used to wash the wounds. Olbrechts mentions three species: And the barks of the following trees were boiled down and the decoction sprinkled over all the affected parts, allowed to dry, and sprinkled remedy is reported for this type of gangrene with accompanying itching. adayeski tsunit \u00f6yi nundiwsk\u00f6na - no gloss This is an obstinate case of adayeski , also known as uweti. While Olbrechts gave no explanation for the names, uweti is also the Cherokee name for Eryngium yuccifolium and glosses as 'root grows straight down' . This may refer to an infection that is perceived to have its roots deep in t he body. It is treated with the roots of Aralia spinosa , the young sprouts albidum , and Pinus pungens are boiled down with some pine sap and unsalted lard. This decoction is applied to the affected areas and the dust of Bovista pila is sprinkled on the wound. No whiskey is allowed for a year. adzil\u00f6 - 'clap, gonorrhea' Olbrechts gave no specific explanation of this condition and provided no special instructions for a cure. There are some remedies mentioned in the individual herb categories. akgitige uts\u00f6ya - 'very sharp' This malady manifests as a condition where the patient experiences sharp pains across the whole back side of the neck. The rem edy is a formula or prayer that was not available to Olbrechts. It ma y be the next condition described. 414 agitigu unit\u00f6y\u00f6 - 'very sharp' This condition was referred to in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 171-173), but the explanation is lacking. In his notes, Olbrechts claims that this condition is due to a sharp object sent by a witch, causing the victim to experience severe pains. However, he refe rs to one of the formulas in Mooney's Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees (1891: 366-369) as depicting the same disease. Mooney refers to this an \"ordeal disease\", or one sent by another person to test the skills of a conjurer. It can also be sent by an enemy and manifests as an excessive appetite or a weed stalk that transforms into a worm in the patient's stomach. Whatever the source, the treatment consists of t he medicine man sucking out the offending object while holding the blossoms of Nicotiana rustica , Cicuta maculata mouth. He then spits the offending matter out of his mouth and often extracts a small object such as a stick, pebble, or insect. ag\u00f6tageni uwe istane\u00e7a - 'he has pains in his forehead' This condition describes a migraine-like headache, possibly caused by the spirit of the Sun (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 21). The remedy for this condition consists of a decoction of the roots and leaves of an unident ified fern known only as the 'fern with a red stalk', which is blown on the crown of the head of the patient. aktoli yut\u00f6ya - 'when their eyes hurt' This is explained as an eye disease caused by seeing a rattlesnake. It is mentioned in The Swimmer Manuscript under a different name (1932: 185), but 415 Olbrechts references them in his notes as the same condition. Two remedies are offered for this condition. The first consis ts of the medicine man chewing the bark of Alnus serrulata and blowing the juice into the patient's eyes. The second is a decoction of Potentilla canadensis and Erichtites hieracifolium mixed with some unidentified herbs. The administration of this remedy was not included. amayi didats\u00f6stoh - 'to take people to the water' While not an illness, the ceremony of going to the water was an integral part of Cherokee life. The ceremony had ethnomedi cal applications and was used to obtain long life, to forget the deceased, to win the heart of another, and in conjunction with a number of therapeutic treatment s. The treatment included t he application of a type of graminoid, or kaneska , and stump water, but there is no explanation of how this was applied. amayi didatsoststi undaniyat\u00f6 - same as above, except it applies to one who is grieving the loss of a family member. Excessive grief was believed to cause serious illness. No other remedy was included with this condition. amayi didatsoststi dinineld\u00f6 - 'to take pregnant women to the water' Pregnant women were taken to the water on the new moon a few months prior to her delivery, the exact time being a subject of debate (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932:118). The medicine man dips some water in his hand and pours it on the head and 416 over the heart (or seat of the soul) of the expectant mother. Prior to the ceremony, the woman drinks a decoction of the bark of Ulmus rubra , the cones of Pinus pugens , which she eliminates through vomiting before the ceremony. This is believed to cleanse the woman and throw off any spoiled saliva (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 119-120). amayiutsistano utsya - 'he is sick by the water' The patient feels a need to urinate whenever they see water. The disease is caused by the spirit of the rive r in response to the patient urinating in the river. It is treated with a cold infusion of the pounded roots of Eryngium yuccifolium , taken at regular intervals. anatoy\u00e7i ustiga - 'if the children cry constantly' This is the stomach or bowel complaints, caused by the \"Little People\" that live in the mountains that tend to afflict young chil dren. This is treated with an infusion of Nicotiana rustica , which is blown over the child for four consecutive nights. All feathers are removed from the house and the child is kept indoors to avoid the passing shadow of a bird. Birds have watery feces, and any contact was thought to exacerbate the condition. This is treated with a decoction of Epigaea repens (Mooney and - 'they are under restriction' This condition usually refers to the restrictions placed on a woman during her menstruation, but can also refer to the re strictions placed on any person who was ill. This was elaborated on in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 246) to include a woman who dreams of birthing a litter of puppies, a bear, or some other animal while menstruating. The patient would dr ink a decoction of new plant of Rubus ideaus that is has sprouted form the tip of the of an older plant. Rubus occidentalis can also be added to the decoction. The roots of the firs t three are selected from those individuals that have roots growing into water and must be from the east side of the tree. This is drunk several times a day for four days while abstaining from salt and hot food. Two other remedies were included in Olbrechts' notes. The combined barks of Xanthrorhiza simplicissima and Calycanthus floridus were steeped in an infusion and drunk all day at regular intervals. Also, the roots of Scutellaria laterifolia and Polymnia uvedalia were prepared and administered in the same manner. andlk\u00f6\u00e7a yunalstune\u00e7a - 'if their urine is stopped' Stopped urine was thought to be caused by the twisting or clogging of the urinary tract. Oxydendrum arboreum was used to remedy this malady because the twigs grew straight, so straight that they were oft en chosen to make arrows (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 222). This remedy was an example of t he Doctrine of Signatures, the straightness of the twig representing the straightening of the urinary passage. Seven twigs were 418 combined with Euonymus americanus and made into an infusion. No salt or hot food were consumed for four days. Another treatment consisted of the imbi bing of as large a quantity as possible of a hot infusion made of Vitis lambrusca , V. aestivalis , and Aristolochia macrophyllum . The first two should have their roots growing in water. Again, no salt or hot food were consumed for four days. aninedzi ada n\u00f6woti tuksinig\u00f6way\u00f6 nategs\u00f6i - no gloss in the notes, but in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 251) he glosses it as 'their breast, to cure anyone with, terrapin does it to them, as they go about' This is a piercing pain in the breast or pelvis region that is caused by dreaming of terrapins. The most painful area is rubbed and a strong down four tomes on four consecutive days. The patient drinks enough to induce vomiting and fasts until the next treatment. aninedzi dig\u00f6walos\u00f6\u00e7i yune istane\u00e7a - 'to cure anyone with a piercing pain in their breast' This is a sharp pain in the chest caus ed by a ghost. The treatment consisted of the recitation of a prayer while rubbing the saliva from the chewed root of Panax quinquefolium over the heart area. A similar treatment from The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 202) consists of an infusion of Aristolochia serpentaria into which a few scrapings of P. quinquefolium and seven live coals have been added, which is drunk 419 after the medicine man recites a prayer and blows on the breast of the patient four times. Each treatment is repeated four ti mes, the whole ceremony is repeated four times before noon, and, if necessary, it is continued for four consecutive days. aninedzi dik an\u00f6woti - 'to cure their breast with' This is a respiratory condition synonymous with ganedzi u ts\u00f6ya (see below). It was treated by massaging the patient with wa rmed hands, exerting slight pressure in a counterclockwise direction. After each rubbing, a pass was made in the four directions to \"scatter the disease.\" The breath was blown on the patient, once after the first pass, twice after the second pass, until the ceremony was complete. Olbrechts' notes simply say \"etc.\" after the second pass, but I will assu me that there were four passes as this is common in many other ceremonies. A decoction of four tops of Pinus pungens was also prepared, possibly with other plants, but t he directions for use were not included. aninedzi gotiski - 'their breast swells' While Olbrechts states that this condition is also known as black dal\u00e2ni (see below), the treatments he gives in his notes are different than those he reported for black dal\u00e2ni in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 224). The symptoms consisted of the swelling of the abdomen and navel area due to a biliary complaint. The turtle and the terrapin were believed to be the cause of the problem, such as when one forgot to wash their hands after handling the terrapin rattles. Olbrechts recorded three treatments for this condition. An infusion of Aristolochia serpentaria , warmed by the addition of seven live coals, was blown on the patient's 420 head, neck, and back (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 224). A warm infusion of the bark of Prunus serotina was rubbed on the patient by the medicine man while he recited the proper prayer. A warm infusion to the patient as an emetic for four consecutive mornings (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 209) and the remainder was rubbed on by the medicine man as wi th the previous treatment. anin\u00f6skeni yuwot is\u00f6 uyotgisti - 'if their leg swells and itches' This was caused by insects seeking revenge for human transgressions. The remedy consisted of making a salve by burning an old shoe to a powder and mixing it with bear's grease. aniskina g\u00f6wani ts\u00f6 ist\u00f6i - 'when they have been made sick by dead persons' Dreams of a deceased person was considered to cause diseases similar to those caused by ghosts (see below). Some medicine m en reported that it wa s the dream itself that caused the disease, others claimed t hat it was just a symptom of the ghostly affliction. Three remedies were offered for this condition. A decoction of the roots of Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica was blown over the patient by the medicine man, then the leaves and flowers were chopped and also applied externally. Massage was also used. The medicine man could also massage the patient after warming his hands by the fire. The other treatment consist ed of a mixture of 24 plants, 24 being the maximum ceremonial number, but no one coul d name all 24 plants. The large number 421 of plants was attributed to the fact that th is was such a difficult disease to diagnose and the right remedy might be included in the mixture. aniskina uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i - 'ghosts have changed (the condition of the patient)' Human ghosts were thought to be able to change or aggravate the condition of a patient, rattling the medicine man who is treat ing the condition. Olbrechts reported four remedies for this were combined with another unidentified herb, but the mode of application was not included. The seat of the pain could be sucked with a sucking horn. Panax quinquefolium was chewed and forcefully blown on the patient by the medicine man. And the medicine man could al so massage the patient after warming his hands by the fire. aniskoli ada n\u00f6woti - 'to cure headache' This is the ordinary headache. No caus e was included. The medicine man would warm his hands and place them on the temples or where the pain was worse and blows his breath on the same area. Ordinary chewing tobacco ( Nicotiana tobacum ) or Panax quinquefolium were chewed and the juice blown on the patient's forehead, temples, neck, and crown of the head (Mooney Olbrechts 1932: 171, blow on their heads' The symptoms include headache, chills, and cold sweat. To treat it, an infusion of the leaves of Castanea pumila was heated with seven coals and blown on the patient's head and shoulders. aniskoli une istane\u00e7a - 'they have a headache' This was another form of the comm on headache, the symptoms being the same as the previous condition. The treatment consisted of an unidentified type of purplish colored water cress that grows on stagnant wa ter, which was regularly poulticed on the head. Also, the medicine man would blow his breath on the crown of the patient's head. aniskuya g\u00f6wanu s\u00f6 sti\u00e7a - 'women's disease, given them by men' While referring to syphilis in female pati ents, the disease also refers to male infections. No remedies were included in this section of Olbrechts' notes. aniy\u00f6tseni ada n\u00f6woti - 'to cure their throat' This could be diphtheria or an acute ca se of laryngitis. The Cherokee understood this to be caused by insect ghosts taking up residence in the throat area. The medicine man would mash the leaves of Verbascum thapsus and hold them as a poultice on the throat area. He would blow his breath on the throat. The treatment was repeated four times. This appears to be the same condition described in formula 62 of The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 261), in which a warm decoction of Gnaphalium obtusifolium is blown into the patient's throat through a tube of Eupatorium 423 purpureum . The patient then avoids apples and peaches, whose watery nature resembles the blisters in the throat, and bean bread dumplings, whose shape resemble the swelling in the throat. anskits\u00f6'\u00f6 sk\u00f6i - 'whenever they dream (of...)' This is digestive trouble accompanied by nightmares. There was no remedy included with this condition. antasgiski tskoya - 'insects are breaking out' Insects were thought to cause boils, blister, and related skin eruptions. Ambrosia artemisifolia was steeped and sprinkled on the sores and the medicine man would blow his breath on the affected parts. asetsunda kanel\u00f6 tsc koya - 'when they (plotters) give insects to each other on purpose' Witches and mankillers make insects out of their saliva and send out the disease spirits to inflict their competitors. This condition is addressed with a prayer or spoken formula. askoli uwe istane\u00e7a - 'he has a headache' See aniskoli above. 424 askwageni uts\u00f6ya - 'when his side hurts' The side hurts due to insects sent by a hostile conjurer. The painful area was massaged after warming the hands and the breath was blown on the area. This was repeated four times. atawini ei - 'the forest dwellers' (Olbrechts names dawine\u00e7i as a synonym, but provides no gloss.) This condition is due to mishandling or disrespect of the bodies of game animals. Activities such as inhaling while disembowel ing an animal or urinating on the spot where blood has been spilled can cause the disease, which may be similar to the rheumatism sent by Little Deer to hunters who have not honored the corpse of a slain deer (Mooney 1900: 251). According to the formula that Mooney recorded, the patient drinks of Aureolaria . However, Olbrechts expanded on this remedy in The Swimmer Ma nuscript (1932: 244). In this version, the symptoms are clarified to include a \"frothy discharge from the bowels, acco mpanied by gripping pains in the abdominal region.\" The decoction was drunk for four days while avoiding hot foods, salt, and the grease from animals. The expanded formula still included U. rubra , P. occidentalis , Q. rubra and but he replaces Alnus serrulata with Tilia americana and adds two species of Aureolaria , A. virginiana and another that grows \"in the pine woods.\" This could be A. flava , which favors pine savannahs and mixed woods (Radford al. 1968: 958). 425 awini uniyst osg\u00f6 - 'they are burning inside' This was a stomach disorder of ve ry young children where they tended to be constantly thirsty and drool excessively. The child was treated with an infusion of Euonymus americanus and an unidentified plant, then . ayeligogi like it' Mankillers and plotters (wizards) s end diseases and confuse the symptoms so that they baffle the healer. This class of diseases is discussed in The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 33) and is often due to the feudi ng of rival conjurers or can be sent as a joke by friends and relatives as a means to test the skill of the healer. Several approaches are used to treat this condition. Seven pine tops were made into a decoction and given four times in succession. The formula from The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 187) stipulates that the pine tops should be harvested from different trees and after the administration, the medici ne man carefully hides them in a dry spot. The decoction was passed four times over the head of the patient before being drunk. Another approach was to warm the hands and massage the patient while reciting a formula or prayer. Sucking the site of the malady, without a sucking horn, was done with the leaves of Lobelia spp. in the mouth of the medici ne man. decoction one other unidentified plant was also a remedy for this condition. This formula is much the same as that for aniskina uniyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i described above. The 426 missing remedies may complement each other. And finally, Panax quinquefolium was chewed and the saliva blown over the patient. ayelsti tsundat istan\u00f6\u00e7i - 'pierced by a knife' The treatment is the same as that for piercing with wood splinters (see adayunitil\u00f6 above). ayoti uden\u00f6\u00e7i yunit \u00f6isti\u00e7a - 'they made ill by the having borne a child' Olbrechts described this condition as comp lications from childbirth, but provided no remedies. dag\u00f6na - this appears to have two meanings, fresh water mussels and a variety of face pimples. No remedies were provided. dal\u00e2ni - 'yellow' Dal\u00e2ni takes its name from the yellow bile t hat was observed to be present in the vomit of the patient. Mooney referred to t he condition as \"old biliousness\" and ascribed it to the irregular eating habits of the Cherokee (1891: 365). While Mooney interpreted the Cherokee explanation for dal\u00e2ni as due to the revenge of the terrapin and the turtle, Olbrechts expands the explanation to include the spirits of vengeful animal spirits. These confound the bile and cause excess bile to collect in the veins under the navel (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 182). In his notes , Olbrechts describes the most common symptoms of dal\u00e2ni , which include a sallowness of the face, black rings around the 427 eyes, dark urine, and a frothy discharge from the bowels. In The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 182) he adds vomiting of bile and sor eness around the navel to these symptoms. If contemporary studies are considered, it is not surprising that this condition would be prevalent among the Cherokee. Biliary dis eases occur at a much higher rate among North American Native Americans than in white populations, with the frequency among Pima women over age 25 reaching as high as 75 percent (Sievers and Fisher 1981). The factors cited as the most likely expl anation for this are a combination of genetic predisposition for biliary disease and the adopt ion of westernized diets (Weiss et al. 1984, Shaheb 1990, Heaton 1984). Diets high in fat and refined carbohydrates coupled with a decrease in physical activity exacer bate the inherent propensity for the condition. Olbrechts provided several varieties of dal\u00e2ni , most of them identified by an association to a color term. As he attribut ed the variation in color to color symbolism instead of from the recognition of differing symptoms, those six varieties will be included under this heading. They include dal\u00e2ni However, black dal\u00e2ni is considered the most virulent manifestation of the condition and was highlighted in The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees . In this form, the symptoms were described in the following manner, \"the navel and abdomen of the patient swell, t he ends of his fingers become black, dark circles appear about his eyes, and the throat contracts spasmodically and causes him to fall down suddenly insensible (1891: 365).\" The primary therapy for dal\u00e2ni consisted of the medicine man warming his hands by the fire and massaging the navel area of the patient. This was repeated four times 428 between sunrise and noon. Several plants were also used for dal\u00e2ni , but will be included with the various other forms of t he condition below and in the individual plant monographs. dal\u00e2ni dikstoti - 'to make patient vomit bile' This variety of dal\u00e2ni was typified by a painful, swollen abdominal area and a loss of appetite accompanied by vomiting. It was bel ieved that the sooner the patient would vomit out the offending bile, the sooner the condition would subside. A warm decoction of the as an emetic. Olbrechts noted that all four of the inner barks of these species have a yellowish coloration, which he determined to be symbolically associated with (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 218). dal\u00e2ni ga\u00f6ski - 'dal\u00e2ni down' Pain in the pit of the stomach caus ed the patient to double over. The bark of Quercus stellata was boiled down and drunk all day, four cups at a time. dal\u00e2ni gotiski - 'swelling dal\u00e2ni ' This may be a synonym for black dal\u00e2ni , describing the tendency towards distention of the stomach. dal\u00e2ni unitel\u00f6ska - 'shaking dal\u00e2ni ' This describes twitching tissue, the navel. 429 dal\u00e2ni unit\u00f6y\u00f6 udiy\u00f6tali - 'their navel is ill with dal\u00e2ni ' The seat of pain is directly around the navel. dal\u00e2ni tsan\u00f6tiy\u00f6skili\u00e7a - 'when they have yellow slime coming out of their nostrils' Dreams about the sun or moon causes yell ow mucus to discharge from the nose. This is not a form of the condition dal\u00e2ni , but one in which the yellow color is a diagnostic feature. It was treated by drinking a decoction The best discussion for this condition comes from The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 253). The symptoms started as exce ssive urine that gradually decreased and became more yellow. If urine flow stopped comp letely, it was thought the patient would die. The primary treatment consis ted of a decoction of of Lysimachia quadrifolia . Taboos included salt, hot foods, and sexual intercourse, but onl y if all seven ingredients were present. No taboo was observed if less than seven were used. Other formulas incorporated a broad spectrum of the Cherokee pharmacopoei a. A decoction of the roots of an Ilex Quercus stellata and Q. velutina , all harvested from the east side of the tree, was drunk all day. No salt or hot food was taken for four days. A decoction of the combined Vitis aestivalis for as was a combination of Platanus occidentalis , Quercus alba , and a type (see chapter on herbaceous plants). danakewsk\u00f6i - 'when they have sore eyes' This condition could be caught by looking at someone who was already afflicted by it. The treatment consisted of the scraped bark from the stem of Xanthorhiza simplicissima , which was put in water and then placed on a cloth. The cloth was then placed over the eyes of the patient when t hey went to bed and they were cured by the next day. danastayesk\u00f6i - 'when they cramp' or daystayeska - 'cramps in the arms or legs' This is a condition caused by dreaming of deer or rabbits. No remedy was observed. daninsugi - 'sore eyes' or 'when they have them drooping' Olbrechts gave several spoken formulas for this affliction of the eyes (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 184, 185, 219), which consist ed of sensitivity to light from the sun or a fire due to seeing a rattlesnake. The medicine man would blow an infusion or the juice from the chewed bark of Alnus serrulata into the eyes of the patient. 431 dawzni e i unit\u00f6y\u00f6 - no gloss Olbrechts did not mention this condition in his glossary of Cherokee ethnomedical conditions, but it was included in his botanical notes. Unfortunately, there is no information on the gloss for the name or any indication of the nature of the condition, but he did record a botanical formula. A combination was used for this condition, but no directi ons for their application was included. didanikwutisgi - 'rheumatism in the kneecaps' The Cherokee related rheumatism in the knees to a problem with the kidneys. Treatment consisted of cooking and pounding Actaea pachypoda , combining it with rattlesnake oil, putting it in a cloth, and wrapping it around the knees. did\u00f6lesgi - 'the crippler' or it breaks them'. The condition under considerati on here is rheumatism. The cause of the condition was attributed to the spirits of sl ain animals seeking revenge for their demise or to the measuring worm, wahl, because of the resemblance of the contracted limb to the motion of the caterpillar. Wahl is also used a synonym for did\u00f6lesgi (Mooney 1900: 347) . Olbrechts also notes that dreams of the opposite sex may cause the condition, as will sexual excess or incest (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 196). 432 A range of treatments were employed agai nst 'the crippler'. Sometimes the medicine man would blow his breath on the afflicted area, or he would blow the medicine, consisting of a decoction of the r oots of ferns (see chapter on ferns), and rub it on the patient Mooney (1891: 347). T he patients could be scratched and eel oil rubbed on all their joints (Mooney and Olbrec hts 1932: 196) or the patient is massaged with a wooden pestle made from the wood of Diospyros virginiana (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 292). The taboos observ ed while under treatment include the avoidance of salt or lye, hot food, and women as well as consumption of the foot or leg of any animal or any animal that was observed to have a humped back (Mooney 1891: 349). digan\u00f6yeyaski geso dinigalo - 'exema on their thigh' No explanation or treatment was available for this condition. dikanigeni du ts\u00f6ya gwali - 'his knees hurt' a synonym for didanikwutisgi , but Olbrechts did not clarify its meaning. No treatment was explained. dikanugosti nug\u00f6tl\u00f6 g\u00f6toti - 'to be used with a briar to cause it to come out' This is the scratching done to relieve the patient from cramps. Similar to rheumatism, this ailment is caused by vengef ul spirits of slain deer and often afflicts hunters. The patient would be scratched with Smilax glauca and have a warm infusion of Pseudognaphalium obutusifolium and Vicia caroliniana rubbed into the scratches four 433 times before while the patient was fa sting (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 207). An alternative preparation included the previous plants combined with Kalmia latifolia description was given for the conditi on, but the name suggests that it was a severe earache. Leucothoe axillaris was applied to this condition, but no instructions were included. Nicotiana rustica was also chewed and blown on the patient. diniskwageni dik an\u00f6wati - no gloss Panax quinquefolium was chewed and blown on the patient. diniysti anadeusk\u00f6i - 'for children to be born' Olbrechts explained that there were onl y two complications for giving birth, a slow delivery and poor placement of the uterus (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 125). To speed up a delivery, a decoction of Impatiens capensis was blown on the birthing mother. diniysti tsiduniskwoldisg\u00f6i - no gloss No explanation was provided for this condition. 434 ditsst\u00f6tiyi g\u00f6tti - 'to use horn' The sucking horn was used by the medicine man to remove infection from an area with swelling. Mooney reported that scarification with a sharp object was performed prior to sucking, and an object such as a stick or a pebble was often found in the extracted blood (Mooney 1891: 334). Ol brechts found no sucking horns were available when he was among the Cherokee, but had one made while he was there. The horn was covered with a turkey's gizzard tightly stretched over the small end. The medicine man would place the horn over t he infected area at an angle and suck the air out. By the time he was among the Cherokee, they no longer used the horn, but the medicine man would use his mouth to do the sucking. dualagosa - 'inflammation of the palate' This is probably an infection of the mouth caused by the yeast Candida albicans , a condition commonly referred to as thrush. Clethra acuminata was used, but no directions were provided. dulasiden\u00f6 dudile \u00f6se\u00e7a - 'his feet become hot for him' No remedy was recorded for this condition. duletsi - 'kernels' or duletsi ant asgiski 'kernels' referr ed to goiterous swellings in the throat area, or the scrofulous swellings due to tuberculosis. The Cherokee thought this condition was due to some sort of physica l trauma. Several remedies and formulas 435 were applied to this condition, demonstrat ing the seriousness or the problem of tuberculosis among Native Americans both then and now (Rieder 1989). Corn cobs were burnt and before they cooled they were placed on the swellings. They were then thrown outdoors, but not on the fire. Vicia caroliniana was burnt and the charcoal boiled. Cynoglossum virginianum and the pitch from Pinus pungens were added to the boiled charcoal and allowed to cool. The patient was instructed to eat honey for a lifetime and fresh meat until well. Calycanthus floridus and Pyrularia pubera were combined for duletsi , but no further instructions were included. Other plants used si ngly or in formulas without instructions for use included Sassafras albidum ; A formul a gleaned from Olbrechts botanical notes indicates that , Quercus velutina , and used for duletsi . duletsi iyunsti - no gloss No further information was provided for this form of duletsi . It was treated with a Cynoglossum virginianum . duletsi tsunstianaya lewski - no gloss No further information was provided for this form of duletsi . No treatment was included. 436 dunats\u00f6 walst\u00e7\u00f6 - 'when they have pains along both sides' No treatment was recorded for this condition. dunats\u00f6wal\u00f6 ne \u00f6i - 'swellings on both sides' This was a condition of the kidneys due to dreaming of crawling things such as snakes, lizards, etc. The remedy consisted of a young root growing from a new sprout of an old root of Sambucus canadensis . The root was steeped in water ata - 'inflamed palate' 'when the mount is sore' This condition may have been more serious than the previous inflammation of the palate. Olbrechts indicates that the palate and pharynx are covered with a membrane or blisters, suggesting the sympt oms of diphtheria (Thomas 1997: 547). It was treated with Carya glabra or a combination of Diospyros virginiana and Vitis aestivalis ; however, no directions were included. duniel\u00f6i - 'their hands are killed by frostbite' There were several spoken formulas for frost bitten feet (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 257, 258, 298), but none for the hands (see tsunastag\u00f6\u00e7i below). No remedies were included with this condition. 437 dunikstisg\u00f6i - 'when they vomit' or they vomit what they eat' Vomiting was believed to be caused by dreaming of fish because that would cause the spoiling of the saliva. When the sali va gets spoiled it tastes different and may change color, often turning white or yellow and becoming thick. Remedies for this condition included Echium vulgare with no instructions for its use and the 'little birch', which, probably referred to wintergreen ( Gaultheria procumbens ) due to its having the same smell and flavor as birch. This wa s drunk before breakfast and vomited in the yard. dunileni dunt askiye\u00f6i - 'their ears burst' Olbrechts gave no further information on this condition and did not mention it in The Swimmer Manuscript, which is surprising considering that he found several synonyms for earaches. dunitsal\u00f6i - 'when they have blisters' Olbrechts indicated that the bliste rs mentioned here also included scabs. In The Swimmer Manuscript , he identifies the condition as \"fever blisters\" brought on by the heat of summer (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 211). These blisters were treated with the dried, brittle leaves of Castanea pumila , heated with seven coals and blown on the upper portion of the patient. In his notes he recorded a combination of Castanea pumila and Magnolia acuminata was used as the remedy, but no instructions were included. 438 duniyugwatisg\u00f6i - 'pains moving about (in the teeth)' Mooney interpreted this condition as neuralgia, a generalized pain affecting several teeth (1891: 358). dun\u00e7tasgielido \u00f6i - 'when they are bursting out' Olbrechts identified this condition as burst scrofula that manifest as boils that appear in different places. This was treated with a combination of Salix humulis and S. alba, boiled together and applied on the sores. dun\u00f6lestoi - 'when they have it broken' No information was provided for this condition or plants used to treat it. dustits\u00f6 uts\u00f6ya - 'he is sick between where head and neck joins' A prayer or spoken formula was spoken. No more information was available about this condition. duwayes\u00f6 waloska - 'cramp in finger', duwayes\u00f6 unats\u00f6 - 'cramp in toe' Cramps were thought to be caused by catching cold. The remedy was scratching with the leaves of Leucothoe axillaris and blowing a decoction of the pounded and steeped leaves on the cramping spot. 439 eisti andik \u00f6\u00f6i - no gloss Olbrechts' notes indicate that the pr imary symptom of this condition may have been painful urination, and the notes under each re medy indicate that this was the case. While the nature of the condition itself was not clearly defined, Olbrechts did record three formulas consisting of several plants each. A combination of unidentified plant were used, but no informat ion was available on how they were used. Dirca palustris , Cassia marilandica , and two unidentified plants were combined, but again, no information was available on the pr ocessing of this formula. The bark Diospyros virginiana were steeped raw and drink. The patient would avoid salt and hot food for four days. gakweoski - 'wrapped up', 'coiled up', 'contracted', 'heart attack' The Cherokee belief was that heart attacks were caused by the lungs wrapping tightly around the heart. This was due to dreams of wild animals such as bears, panthers, etc. Treatment consisted of scrat ching the patient with a briar scratcher starting across the tongue. Scratching cont inued across the body, including across the seat of the \"soul\" or the heart region. Olbrec hts indicated that a decoction was sprinkled over the scratched area, but did not name the plants used in his description of the condition. Another treatment consisted of the roots of Vicia caroliniana and Coronilla varia , pounded and steeped, then rubbed on the pati ent as the medicine man was blowing his breath on the afflicted area. Th is was done four times consecutively. Food 440 taboos consisted of the avoidance of chicken wings and any kind of animal foot, as well as the life long avoidance of rabbit flesh. gan\u00e7awad\u00f6\u00f6ski - 'blisters caused by heat' This was severe sunburn causing blisters as if burned by a fire. The bark of Diospyros virginia na was boiled and rubbed on the burned areas until the blisters disappear. ganedzi u ts\u00f6ya - 'he is sick in the breast' This condition encompassed a range of respiratory conditions including pneumonia, pleurisy, and bronchitis. It was belie ved to be caused by dreaming of fish or terrapins. It was treated with Morus rubra and Prunus pensylvanica , but no directions use was included. ganewot iski - 'measles' Olbrechts indicated that this condition affected adults and children alike, covering them with pimples and turning the skin red. The treatment consisted of Lindera benzoin , but no further instructions were included here. gatesgeni u ts\u00f6ya - 'his spine aches' No description for this sort of backache was provided, but it was treated with a combination of Solidago caesia , Cynoglossum virginianum , and an unidentified plant. No directions for their use were included. 441 gayedi - 'pain in the back' This condition occurred due to eating food prepared by a menstruating woman. Several remedies and formulas were applied to alleviate gayedi. The roots of Desmodium cuspidatum were boiled and drunk all day while fasting. Three combinations of plants were included without fu rther instructions. The first consisted , Aster laevis , and plants. The second was a combination of Euphorbia carollata and an unidentified plant. The third americana, Euonymus americanus , - 'they have it caused by plotters' This condition was due to some form of conjuring, but was not clearly defined. The remedy consisted of Lobelia cardinalis and L. spicata , boiled down and blown on the patient's throat. getsiyowl\u00f6\u00e7i - 'when they have been shot' The bark of Carya ovata was used, but no instructions were included. However, he did clarify it under the condition of yigetsiyol\u00f6 below. gigage dunit o n\u00f6\u00f6sk\u00f6i - 'when they have red spots' No further information was available for this condition, but Spigelia marilandica , which was reported to grow in Tennessee, was used to treat it. 442 gig\u00f6 analdziskwsk\u00f6i - 'when they vomit blood' The conditions here are distinguished onl y by the amount of blood eliminated by the patient. There were several causes. T he eating of game killed without observing the proper taboos, such as observation of purific ation rites by the hunter or respectfully handling the animal's remains, could cause th is condition. Also, eating food prepared by a menstruating woman or eating too much salt might cause the expulsion of blood. Remedies included Platanus occidentalis , the slender roots of which were pounded, steeped, and drunk throughout the whole night as we ll as first thing in the morning. No salt, meat of any kind, or hot food was taken at this time. Fraxinus americana was mixed with Phlox stolonifera , steeped, and drunk. A species of blackberry or raspberry was also used, but the species and direction for use was unavailable. gig\u00f6 danay\u00f6skoi \u00f6i - 'when they bleed from both nostrils' This, like most conditions where bleedi ng occurred, was attributed to eating food prepared by a menstruating woman. No treatment was included. gig\u00f6 dig\u00f6guski - 'when they discharge blood from their bowels' This was due to severe cases of dysentery. The roots of Ceanothus americanus were boiled and the tea was drunk cold all day. Rosa palustris was also used, but no instructions were included. Olbrechts also included this condition in The Swimmer Manuscript , indicating that a decoction of the barks of Prunus pensylvanica and 443 Diospyros virginiana were given to the patient after repeated boiling Olbrechts 1932: 275). gig\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7a - 'urinating blood' Two formulas were included for blood in t he urine, but no instructions for their use was included. Lobelia cardinalis of the Solanaceae family were reported to be combined for this condition, but it is doubtful that Cicuta maculata was a component as it contains a deadly toxin. The second formula consisted - 'when their stomach is swollen' This condition occurred when a witch changed the food in the stomach and this caused swelling. Olbrechts explained further in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 281) that the food was thought to sprout or change into a living thing in the body. The remedy, only found in Olbrechts' notes and not in The Swimmer Manuscript Platanus were drunk as an emetic. 444 g\u00f6skanugoga - 'arse bowel falls out' Olbrechts identified this condition as a prolapsed rectum, but provided no information on a remedy in this section. g\u00f6wanigist\u00f6i - 'when they are eaten by them' No explanation of this condition was prov ided in the notes, but a condition with a similar name was published in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 179). The condition known as \"eaters\" was a ur inary tract or kidney disease, affecting the patient by causing pain in the lower ba ck and turning the urine yellow. The remedies combined in the formula for this condition give no clues either, as they were not commonly used for any one affliction. The tr eatment consisted of a combination of an unidentified plant made into a decocti on and blown on the left foot, right hand, right foot, left hand, and crown of the head, respectively. inad\u00f6 danskits\u00f6i - 'when they dream of snakes' Dreaming of being bitten by a snake was treated as an actual snakebite, but with different medications. If this was not done, the patient would eventually develop the symptoms of an actual bite. Botrychium virginianum was used for the dream bite, the root boiled down to a syrup and the decocti on rubbed on the place where the patient dreamed they had been bitten (Mooney and Olbrec hts 1932: 176). To cure the spoiled saliva that may be the result of a snak e dream, the patient would drink an the vine of Rhus radicans that is found growing on the east side of a tulip poplar tree. inad\u00f6 egwa tsanot \u00f6skei - 'when they have made a big snake' Unfortunately, Olbrechts gave no further information about this condition with a very interesting name. inad\u00f6 unisk\u00f6t ts\u00f6\u00e7i - 'if they are bitten by snakes' The rattlesnake was considered a supernatural being by the Cherokee and care was taken not to offend one. In case of a bite, tobacco juice was rubbed on the punctured spot, the rubbing performed in a c ounterclockwise direction signifying the uncoiling of the snake. Dreams about bites were also treated, or the patient would suffer inflammation and the symptoms of an actual bi te at some point in the future (Mooney 1891: 352). tciski g\u00f6wagisti - 'when children sleep with eyes open' No further information was available for this condition. tckoya - 'insects cause swelling in body' The spirits of slain insects were believed to take up residence under a person's skin and causes swellings, blisters, and ulcers (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 29). No remedy was available for condition. 446 tsatag\u00f6 un\u00f6t agwali ustiga - 'chicken pox' The gloss here is not a literal translation, but this is all Olbrechts provided. No remedy was included. tsidunitsile\u00e7a - 'when they have itching' The primary symptom for this condition, itchy genitals, was believed to be caused by urinating on the ashes from a fire. The primary treatment was the chewed root of Aristolochia serpentaria , which was blown into the urethra of the patient. If A. serpentaria was not available, Liriodendron tulipifera was considered an acceptable substitute (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 286). In his notes he claimed that Pinus pungens was the preferred remedy for this condition. tsidunitstaldia - 'if they have scars' The bark of Carya ovata , the wound healer mentioned above for bullet and arrow wounds, was chewed and blown on the scars. No salt or hot food was taken for four days. tsidunilienoga - 'earache' See dunileni dunt askiye\u00f6i above. tsukolo diganugogi - no gloss Olbrechts indicates that this is a form of necrosis, possibly a type of adayeski (see above). 447 tsukon\u00f6\u00e7i uts\u00f6ya - 'sick in the testicles' No further information was available for this condition. tsunastag\u00f6\u00e7i - 'their feet are frostbitten' Three of the sacred formulas were dedicated to frostbitten feet (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 257, 258, 298), but only one mentions a plant used to alleviate frostbite. The patients would put t heir feet under a covering of dried Andropogon virginicus , the favored shelter for the rabbit who appears to be immune from this affliction. The other therapy mentioned cons isted of the medicine man holding snow or ice in his mouth and sucking on the frostbitten area. tsunalul\u00f6di eldi tsunun\u00f6t stane\u00e7a - 'when womb falls down' No further information is available for th is condition. It is unclear whether this was a prolapsed uterus, or was related to the afterbirth. tsunisk\u00f6istigi ut iyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i - 'when where they (children) have to suck is changed' No further information was available for this condition. tsuniyotogia - 'when they itch' Olbrechts indicated that this was an itch ing of the private parts and scratching the itch caused painful sores. The condition was due to the youthful indiscretion of urinating on the fire or the ashes from a fire. T he itching may begin immediately after the transgression or can lie dormant until adult hood. Treatment consisted of a combination 448 of Hackelia virginiana and Cynoglossum virginianum , the roots or which made into a decoction. The affected parts were bathed in the decoction and the patient drank a portion. No food or drink was taken whil e under treatment, which lasted four days (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 174). tsuniy\u00f6tsot isga - 'when they have swelling in the neck' This may have been a case of the mumps, but Olbrechts did not elaborate. tsunstiga did\u00f6t tadin\u00f6dan ti - 'to make (the child) jump down from her' A warm decoction of Xanthorhiza simplicissima was blown on the head, breast, and palm of each hand of the birthing mother to stimulate the arrival of the child (Mooney 1891: 364). tuyasti - 'big boil' No explanation was provided for the nat ure or remedy for this condition. udilegi dal\u00e2ni utan\u00f6 - 'yellow fever' No further information was av ailable for yellow fever. udile\u00f6ska - 'fever' This appears to be a generic term for fevers, but Olbrechts did not elaborate. - 'he is paralyzed on one side' This condition was believed to be due to lightening or the blood being stopped (stroke?). It was treated with a combination of Aralia spinosa, Cirsium altissimus , and two species of small thistles. No direct ions for their preparation were included. unakanostisg\u00f6i - 'swollen testicles' Olbrechts also names tsukon\u00e7\u00f6\u00e7i as a synonym for this condition, but gives no further description for the condition or the cause of it. The remedy consisted of Apios americana , Antennaria solitaria , and an unidentified tuberous root, which were pounded, steeped, and the infusion blown on the distre ssed area four times. The bark of the unidentified plant was then applied as a poultice. unakewag\u00f6i - 'if they lost their voice' Olbrechts identified this condition as a ca se of chronic laryngitis, possibly due to diphtheria. The patient was very hoarse. This condition may have been synonymous with dunialag\u00f6i ata yesgi , but the remedies were different. The formula had several variations. The one from the notes consisted of a combination of Quercus imbricaria , Cornus virginica and Malus pumila . Directions for their use were not included. The version in The Swimmer Manuscript consisted of a decoction of the inner barks , drunk by patient and rubbed on the throat and neck. The bark was usually harvested from the east side of the tree (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 199). unakon\u00e7\u00f6 - no gloss This condition was probably also connected with the testicles (see below), but no description or gloss was included. It was treated with Verbascum thapsus and Cicuta maculata (or possibly a less toxic relative), but no directions were reported. unakon\u00e7\u00f6 yunot iise\u00e7a - no gloss Olbrechts indicated that this was also a case of swollen testicles, but did not elaborate. The remedy mentioned here was a type of fungus, but it was not identified and no directions for its use were included. unal\u00f6tel\u00f6 - 'they have fits' Olbrechts did not elaborate on this condition, but did report that onage was a Cherokee synonym for this type of seizure. The remedy consisted of a combination of their use was included. 451 unastayes\u00f6\u00e7i - 'their (arm, leg, neck) is sprained' or unaiyets\u00f6\u00e7i - 'when their back is sprained' Olbrechts claimed this condition was c aused by \"brisk or excited movement\". It was treated with the bark of a type of wild cherry ( Prunus spp .) that was pounded, steeped, and applied to the area as well as being drunk. unawasti - 'he gets cold' or 'that which chills one' Mooney describes this condition as the fe ver or ague that comes with intermittent fever such as that which accompanies malaria. He claimed that it was considered a very serious condition by the Cherokee medici ne men (1891: 361). There were several varieties of unawasti , and they will be considered below. Olbrechts recorded four formulas for unawasti , but only two have any directions on how to prepare the plants. The first consisted of an infusion unidentified plant, which was blown on the patient four times (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: with Dioscorea villosa . The next formula was And finally the leaves of Chenopodium ambrosioides were rubbed between the hands, steeped in water, and blown on the patient. 452 unawasti egwa - 'big chill' This was a severe case of unawasti , typified by symptoms such as a black coloration of the face, high fever, and chil ls accompanied by shaking. The fever was intermittent and would generally appear in t he spring and summer, often returning in subsequent years (Mooney 1891: 361). Treat ment consisted of the bark of Prunus serotina , beaten and placed in water with seven hot coals. This decoction was blown over the patient beginning at sunrise, starti ng at the top of the head, advancing to the right shoulder, the left shoulder, and the tors o of the patient. This was repeated four times, morning and evening, for up to four days if necessary. Nicotiana rustica could be used in place of Prunus serotina (Mooney 1891: 362). Olbrechts recorded two more elaborate formulas for this condition, the first consisting of directions for the preparation or applicat ion or either formula were included. unawasti unitis\u00f6ti\u00e7i - 'the chill that makes them restle ss so that they could not lie still' Olbrechts gave no further description of the condition and provided no remedies for it, but the descriptive name provides mu ch information on the symptoms that were inherent with this condition. unawasti uskga - 'chill caused by the pain of neuralgia, boils, etc.' Again, no further information, but a very descriptive name. 453 unawat\u00f6\u00f6ski - 'blisters' Olbrechts described the blisters as, \"watery blisters which break out on the body in summer, and are caused, according to t he medicine man, but the heat of the sun (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 250).\" His notes on the individual plants suggest that these were fever blisters, probably synonymous with dunitsal\u00f6i , and not the type described above as gan\u00e7awad\u00f6\u00f6ski . The herpes simplex virus, which causes fever blisters, is activated by ultraviolet radiati on. The remedy consisted of a combination of Rhus glabra and R. copallina , the barks of both species made into a decoction which was drunk, blown on the patient, and rubbed on the sores for four days. Food taboos included the avoidance of potatoes, melon, pumpkins, salt, beans, and eggs (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 251). unakewag\u00f6i - 'if they lost their voice' Olbrechts identified this condition as a ca se of chronic laryngitis, possibly due to diphtheria. The patient was very hoarse. This condition may have been synonymous with dunialag\u00f6i ata yesgi , but the remedies were different. The formula had several variations. The one from the notes consisted of a combination of Quercus imbricaria , Cornus virginica and Malus pumila . Directions for their use were not included. The version in The Swimmer Manuscript cons isted of a decoction of , drunk by patient and rubbed on the throat and neck. The bark was usually harvested from the east side of the tree (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 199). 454 undaluy\u00f6\u00e7i - 'chopped' or 'if they have chopped it' I assume this condition referred to an in jury with an axe, but Olbrechts did not elaborate. However, his remedy included a large variety of Hickory ( Carya spp. ) along with another unidentified plant. Hickory wa s one of the primary wound healers in the Cherokee pharmacopoeia and was used to heal a wide range of traumatic wounds, such as the use of Carya ovata for bullet and arrow wounds (Mooney their urinating stopped' For an explanation of this condition, see andlk\u00f6\u00e7a yunalstune\u00e7a above. The treatment consisted of a combination of Cicuta maculata and Xanthium strumarium , but no inst ructions were provided. undile\u00f6sk\u00f6 - 'when they are having a fever' No further information was available for this condition. undiy\u00f6tali ada n\u00f6woti - 'to treat their navel is a synonym of dal\u00e2ni unit\u00f6y\u00f6 (see above). It was treated with Clethra acuminata , but no directions for its use were included. und\u00f6laks\u00f6\u00e7i - 'broken bones' Broken bones were reported to be treated with a combination of Ilex verticillata and Vitis aestivalis , chewed and blown on the scratched pat ient. Olbrechts identified the 455 first species as Ilex laevigata , but it is most likely that the Ilex species under consideration here is I. verticillata . It closely resembles I. laevigata , but is commonly found in the North Carolina mountains. Ilex laevigata is associated with the coastal plain and its range does not extend to the higher elevations (Radford et al. 1968: 684). uneg\u00f6 tsandik\u00f6\u00e7a - 'if they water out white' Olbrechts described this condition as an aggravated case of a kidney infection, the symptoms consisting of pain in the hips and lower back with the discharge of white urine (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 199). Olbrecht s' notes indicate that he was quite familiar with the incidence of gonorrhea among the Cherokee, but he dealt with it in other sections of his notes and it appears to be unrelated to this condition. Several formulas were included in The Swimmer M anuscript and the plants mentioned in these will be discussed here with those from Olbr echts' notes. A combination of the barks from Prunus serotina , Quercus falcata (which Malus pumila , Salix alba , and Cornus florida were made into a strong decoction. Small amounts were taken at fr equent intervals for four days. Olbrechts states that Cornus stricta could be substituted or combined with Cornus florida , but he most likely mistook C. strict a for C. amomum , as the former is more common on the coastal plain and the latter frequent in the m ountains. The patient abstains from salt and hot food for the duration of their treat ment and milk for a much longer period (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 199). Another formula from The Swimmer Manuscript (307) utilizes plants with a prevalent mil ky latex, suggesting the Doctrine of Signatures. Two species of Euphorbia , E. corollata Echium vulgare , the roots of all prepared and drunk as a warm infusion. In severe cases, the roots of Lysimachia quadrifolia were added to the infusion. The formulas in Olbrechts' note were just lists of plants. No instructions on their preparation or administration were included. However, the sheer number of formulas included and the wide range of plant species us ed to address the condition indicate that it was prevalent and considered quite serious by the Cherokee. Severe cases appeared to be handled as a separate illness (see un\u00f6di tsandik u\u00e7a - 'they urinate all milk', flava and Eupatorium purpureum coming out white' Olbrechts gives no clarification of the nat ure of this condition, but it appears to be another form of milky urine. Several plants fr om the category of plants with burrs were mentioned as a remedy for this condition, but the individual species were not identified. Another formula consisted of a combination a decoction all day. No milk or young cabbage leaves were used at this time. 457 unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i or uneistaneo gananugotsidoi - 'when they have pains all over their body' This condition, where there were shi fting pains moving around the patient's body, was one of a group of illnesses caused by a human agent. A witch or another person with a similar power sends a disease that resembles one the medicine man knows, but it is a different condition disguised as t he familiar one designed to perplex the medicine man. Often, an object was shot into the vi ctim's body and the pain was caused by a shift in the object's position (Mooney and Olbrecht s 1932: 257). Two primary formulas were used for this condition. A warm infusion of the bark of Alnus serrulata and the roots of both Lobelia cardinalis and Verbascum thapsus was held in the mouth of the medicine man while he sucked the offending area. He woul d then spit the liquid into a bowl. After four repetitions, he examines the liquid for offending objects that may have been sent by an enemy to cause the patient problems (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 216). The other therapy consisted of external applicat ion of a decoction of the leaves of , Kalmia latifolia , and Veratrum viride , applied after scratching the immediate area of the pain with the leaves of Leucothoe axillaris (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 220). The flowers of Nicotiana rustica were also used for this condition, but no directions for their use was available. uninigwatisg\u00f6i - 'rheumatism in his knees' This is a synonym for didanikwutisgi , but this version came directly from Mooney's notes. The remedy here was a decoction of Rhododendron maximum , applied after scratching. 458 uninidla - 'crevices on the skin' This appears to be a dermatological problem, where the skin is deeply creased or cracked. The remedy consisted of Viburnum , boiled down and applied to the skin. Viburnum rufidilum was the species identified by Olbrechts, but it was more likely V. cassinoides , a common variety in the mountains of North Carolina. unisikwask\u00f6 - 'when they are coughing' The cough mentioned here was due to the nefar ious activities of a witch, enemy, or someone else conversant in the art of conjuring. Olbrechts recorded two formulas, but no directions for the preparation or adm inistration of either were included. A combination Acorus calamus , and Ilex verticillata was applied to treat this condition, as was hot in the skin by them' No further information on this conditi on or its treatment was available. uniskowldisg\u00f6i - 'whenever they have diarrhea' Diarrhea could be caused by several factors, including the changing of the seasons, over-consumption of fruit, or the c onsumption of fish or fowl due to their watery feces. Olbrechts recorded several re medies and formulas for this malady. The bark of the roots of Sassafras albidum was pounded, steeped, and drunk. Coreopsis major and Phlox stolonifera were steeped raw and drunk while the offending foods were 459 avoided for four days. A mixture of Xanthorhiza simplicissima and two unidentified plants were made into a decoction and drunk, as well as being rubbed on the stomach. Salt was avoided for four days. Coreopsis major was used alone, the raw root made into an infusion. A combination of Plantago major , Agrimonia parviflora , and an unidentified plant were make into a decoction that was drunk by the patient and blown on them. uniskowldisg\u00f6i uy\u00f6nskil\u00f6tiiyusti - 'when they have diarrhea and discharge light colored feces' This specific form of diarrhea was treated with the root of Agrimonia parviflora , used a stomach-ache with swollen and throbbing stomach' No additional description for this conditi on was provided, but the name provides us with a good idea of the symptoms. It was treated with a combination of Podophyllum peltatum and a species of Matalea , steeped in warm water and drunk in 2-cup portions. The use of Podophyllum peltatum and the symptoms inherent in the name suggests this is a form of dal\u00e2ni. unitadesgisk\u00f6 - 'thirsty' or unetadegisk\u00f6i - 'they are thirsty' Pathological thirst was treated with one of the astringent herbs, possibly Geranium maculatum or Heuchera americana , the roots of which were boiled and drunk. It was reported to have a very bitter taste. 460 unit\u00f6y\u00f6 yiki uniskwali - 'when they have a stomach ache' Olbrechts indicates that this is an ac ute type of indigestion. It was treated with the fruit of Pyrularia pubera , cut in to four sections and each section swallowed. unitseno iseoi - 'when a person has stomach trouble' This type of stomach trouble was typified by a swollen stomach and indigestion from eating unripe fruit and vegetables. The patient is constantly hungry but loses weight. The remedy consisted of an in fusion made by steeping of the barks of Gleditsia triacanthos and Aesculus octandra with the roots of Specularia perfoliata in warm water for a full night. The following morning the m edicine man took the patient to the river and gave them some of the infusion to drin k and bathing them with the rest (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 239). people of worms' Olbrechts observed that almost all the Cherokee children had roundworms, with hookworms being less common. The remedy recorded by Olbrechts consisted of Spigelia marilandica , taken with honey. 'when they are having a toothache' Sisyrinchium angustifolium was applied to a sore tooth, but no instructions for its application were included. 461 uniyalotisg\u00f6i - 'when their stomach swells up' Olbrechts give no further information on the nature or remedy for this condition, but it appears to be a form of dal\u00e2ni . uniyelosk\u00f6 ada n\u00f6woti - no gloss Olbrechts gave no gloss or remedies for this condition, but I have included it here because he recorded it in his list of conditions. uniyeloisel\u00f6i - 'pain about' This appears to be a synonym unestanelidolo\u00e7\u00f6i. A combination of Lobelia spicata and Alnus serrulata were held in the mouth while the medicine man sucked out the offending object. uniy\u00f6tsotisg\u00f6i - 'when their neck swells' Olbrechts gave no further information on the condition and did not record a remedy. un\u00f6di tsandik u\u00e7a - 'they urinate all milk' This appears to have been a severe infection of the urinary tract. Two versions were reported in The Swimmer Manuscript , both having basically the same symptoms consisting of the discharge of milky urine often appearing with discharges of dark red urine and pain in the pelvic area and lower back. However, in the second version he added excessive perspiration in the groin area as an additional symptom. The first 462 formula consisted of a strong decoction of the quantities at frequent intervals for four days (1932: 199-200). The latter species was probably misidentified as it does not frequently occur in the mountains, more likely species being B. lenta or B. lutea . See the discussion for g\u00fbnetiski in the chapter on trees. The second formula consisted of an infusion of the inner bark of Nyssa sylvatica and the bark of Alnus serrulata , harvested from the east side of the tree near the ground, was drunk at diminishing intervals fo r four days while avoiding sex, salt, and hot foods (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 308). Another formula from the notes consisted of Cynoglossum virginianum and an unidentified plant that had burr-like seeds. No instructions on their preparation or administration were included. un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc e\u00e7a - 'when their appetite gets spoiled' This condition was due to having looked at a corpse or an animal. The patient can not stand the sight of food and nausea caus es them to expectorate. Olbrechts gave several remedies for this condition. A species of Oxalis was used to settle the stomach, but no directions for its use were included. A combination of Quercus bicolor , Q. rubra , and Carya ovata was used, but, again, no directions were included. The bark of Vitis aestivalis was boiled and the decoction drunk. un\u00f6tagwali - 'boils' or 'spots' Olbrechts indicated that this was mo st likely small pox. The Cherokee belief immediately after the Civil War was that whit e doctors kept the disease in a jar in the 463 form of small, red fish. The remedy consis ted of many plants whose roots were boiled and the patient was bathed in the decocti on; however, Olbrechts only recorded Mentha piperita as a constituent of the formula. All fruit was avoided for four days. un\u00f6ti yiduniyalotisti\u00e7a - no gloss Olbrechts indicated that this was a form of children's diarrhea. It was treated with Plantago major , but no directions were included on the procedure. unstiunde non\u00f6\u00e7i aniskwot i yuneistane\u00e7q - 'to cure the mother after birth' No remedies were included for this specific condition but this may be a synonym for utigad\u00f6 (see below). useski - of Blephilia ciliata and Eryngium yuccifolium was drunk to alleviate the cough. usiwaska - 'he is coughing' Breathing in cold air was thought to cause this condition. The remedies consisted of the bark of Prunus serotina , which was boiled and drunk, and the bark of Clethra acuminata , which was scraped from the branches and steeped. 464 uskol\u00f6 gig\u00f6 yunikwolstia - 'if they discharge pale blood from their bowels' Taken from Olbrechts notes, the remedy for this condition is the fern Polypodium virginiana . But he also mentions this condition in The Swimmer Manuscript , with the additional symptom of slimy matter coming fr om the bowels. He indicates that a mountain fern was used in this case, but that the name was too vague to suggest a species (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 276). uskol\u00f6 yandik \u00f6\u00e7i gig\u00f6 - gloss a synonym of dal\u00e2nige tsandik \u00f6\u00e7a or 'yellow urine', but the presence of gig\u00f6 in the name suggests that this was also a condition where blood was present in the urine. No remedies were included. usonuli unt ane\u00f6 - 'sudden attack' The attack here is a heart attack, and Olbrechts noted that this is a synonym of gakweoski . The symptom that typified this condition was a blue tinge around the patient's eyes. Treatment consisted of a co mbination of plants used when a patient was scratched. The formula included Kalmia latifolia a plant not generally associated with scratching, added to the mixture. Cassia marilandica was also used alone, the root pounded and steeped in water and blown on the patient's face and hands by the medicine man. 465 utigad\u00f6 - 'to drive out afterbirth' Olbrechts recorded two remedies to expel the afterbirth. A combination of the roots harvested from the east side of the plants, were boiled down and drunk by the patient. Scutellaria lateriflora and Polymnia uvedalia were also used, and Olbrechts uts\u00f6ya - 'she is sick with remainder' This condition was due to stagnant blood that remained, possibly up to weeks, after a birth. The remedy consisted of talaiyusti , or 'like white oak', an unidentified tree whose bark was boiled and drunk. utiyaktan\u00f6\u00e7i yiki nundiwsk\u00f6na - 'when they have a bad cough' This condition is a synonym of reported again, but here directions for use we re included. The patient drank part of the decoction and some was rubbed on the throat area. uwaise\u00e7a - 'he has a member (arm, leg, etc.) paralyzed' This was very similar to ulotalooska and may have been a synonym. No specific treatment was included with this condition. It may have been the same as that for ulotalooska . 466 have prevented Olbrechts fr om determining a more specific gloss for the terms used for these two synonyms for gonorrhea. The remedy consisted of the root of Eryngium yuccifolium , especially the deepest growing portion of the root, boiled and drunk by the patient. uweti - no gloss This is a synonym for adayeski tsunit \u00f6yi nundiwsk\u00f6na (see above). uyalotisga - 'if there is swelling' This was due to indigestion caused by overeating and may be another form of dal\u00e2ni . The patient suffered from constipati on and abdominal swelling. No remedies were included in Olbrechts' notes for this condition; however, this appears to be the same conditions as that described in fo rmula 86 in The Swimmer Manuscript (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 297). The remedy the decoction was drunk as an emetic and the remainder poured over heated river stones in a sweatbath. uyeloisti unitsonoi - 'he becomes suddenly ill' The patient would fall down and faint fr om the pain of a severe cramp. The treatment consisted of the medicine man ma ssaging the patient after warming his hands 467 by the fire and blowing his breath on the cramped area (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 205). uyoi aniay\u00f6l\u00f6\u00e7i - 'when they have inhaled bad odors' The patient became nauseated from a nox ious odor, such as that from a dead animal or a corpse. The treatment c onsisted of the tops from seven Eryngium yuccifolium plants. Each plant must have only one stalk, a rarity for this species. The infusion was used as an emetic and was taken for four consecutive days in the morning. Hot foods were avoided during treatm ent (Mooney and saliva' See dunikstisg\u00f6i above for an explanation of spoiled saliva. The remedy Olbrechts identified for this condition was a species of Lobelia , but no exact identification or directions for its use were provided. However, Mooney identified Lobelia inflata as a remedy used as an emetic for saliva spoiled by a conjurer (Ms. 1894), so this may be the same species found in Olbrechts notes. uyous\u00f6 tsunineli\u00e7q - 'disgusted by the sight of a corpse' This is possibly a synonym of un\u00f6stayti tsuniyotc e\u00e7a; however, the remedies provided were different than those menti oned above. None of these remedies were accompanied with instructions for their use. Salix alba was combined with an unidentified plant that had an odor like that of a snake. Apios americana was used alone. Betula lutea was also used alone or 468 painful remembrances of the dead' The following plants were used to assuage the grief that accompanied the loss of a loved one, but no directions for their use was included with a Olbrechts provided several remedies for a toothache. The root of Sassafras albidum or the bark of Juglans nigra was placed in the hollow of a rotten tooth. The smoke from Nicotiana rustica (old tobacco) was blown on to the offending tooth. And the nest of a hornet was placed in a pipe and the smoke blown on it as with N. rustica . waili - 'the measuring worm' A rheumatic limb was thought to resemble the measuring worm, so this condition is a synonym for did\u00f6lesgi , This was a type of scrofula, named a fter the cocoon of the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta L. The scrofula or boil was considered to be due to man tramping on the larva of this moth. It was treated by warming the thumb and pressing on the swelling (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 299). 469 yigetsiyol\u00f6 - 'if they have been shot (by a bullet or arrow)' This condition is a synonym for getsiyowl\u00f6\u00e7i (see above). Olbrechts provided two remedies. The first treatment was the same a being wounded by a wood splinter (adayunitil\u00f6). The other comes from The Swimmer Manuscript (1932: 273) and consists of the chewed inner bark of Carya ovata, chewed by the medicine man and the juice blown on the wound with the hollow quill of a buzzard's feather. The down and of the buzzard was then applied to the wound. The patient was to avoid chewing tobacco, salt, and hot food for four days. yig\u00f6waninil\u00f6\u00f6ski - 'when they have suint' Olbrechts claims that this condition is a fo rm of scrofula, but it is unclear how that relates to suint, the lanolin-like substance in the name. The description he provided in his notes depicts boils that crack in both directions before bursting. He said the Cherokee considered this a form of cancer . The remedy consisted of the bark of Platanus occidentalis , boiled and drunk. yutan\u00e7teks\u00f6 - 'if tooth comes out' This was the state when a child lost one of their baby teeth. There was no remedy involved. The child would throw the tooth on to the roof of the house and address the beaver to give them a new one (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 308). 470 y\u00f6wi uniyakan\u00f6\u00e7i - no gloss This condition was similar to and was considered by Olbrechts have been synonymous with the conditions that were sent to rattle the resolve of the medicine man (see - 'when the little people frighten them' The little people were fairy-like spirits that inhabited the mountains, rocks, water, and forests that were only visible to a few gifted individuals (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932: 25). The symptoms of this condition in cluded feeling \"queer, disturbed, lonesome, or dispirited.\" Treatment c onsisted of the roots of Asarum canadense and Hepatica acutiloba and the bark of Amelanchier arborea pounded, steeped, and blown on the area over the heart (the seat of the soul) bef ore dark for four consecutive evenings. The patient was not allowed to have human contact for four days. "}
