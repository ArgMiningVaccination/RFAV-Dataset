NBC News, Dec 16, 2022] Zoltan Rona agrees to no longer practice medicine. On November 4, 2022 the Ontario Physicians and Surgeons Discipline Tribunal [concluded](https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/Rona-Zoltan---Peter/0025401-30224) that Dr. Zoltan Peter Rona had (a) failed to maintain the standard of practice of the profession in his care of a patient and (b) engaged in disgraceful, dishonorable or unprofessional conduct in relation to his communications about the COVID-19 pandemic and related issues. The Tribunal ordered Rona to: (a) attend before the panel to be reprimanded, and (b) pay the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario costs of $6,000 by December 5, 2022. Rona signed an undertaking in which he agreed to resign from the College and not apply or re-apply for registration as a physician to practice medicine in Ontario or any other jurisdiction. The [full decision](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onpsdt/doc/2022/2022onpsdt45/2022onpsdt45.html) described Rona as a general practitioner with \"a solo practice in Thornhill, comprised of 90% complementary medicine and 10% management.\" The decision addresses Rona's management of a patient (Patient A) and use of social media. Patient A complained Rona ignored his chronic nosebleeds, elevated blood pressure, and poor kidney functioning, which ultimately led to a hospital admission due to a hypertensive emergency and kidney failure requiring dialysis. Instead of referring the patient to an appropriate specialist, Rona recommended costly and unproven diagnostic tests. He recommended supplements including [nattokinase](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/nattokinase), though no clear rationale for it was provided in the chart. The patient's nosebleeds developed after taking nattokinase, but Rona failed to connect the nosebleeds to the nattokinase even though bleeding is the product's primary and most serious potential side effect. The Tribunal found: Dr. Rona breached his duty to identify an acute presentation, failed to gauge the severity of Patient A's medical problems and did not appropriately counsel him on the possible consequences of not immediately pursuing standard medical treatment. Dr. Rona overlooked indicators of an acute problem, including vital signs, lab abnormalities and Patient A's adverse reactions to the treatment he had recommended. Though a reasonable complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) physician would have delayed or deferred the provision of any alternative treatments until the patient was medically stable, Dr. Rona failed to do so. All of this fell below what would be reasonably expected of a competent CAM physician. As such, Dr. Rona failed to maintain the standard of practice of the profession in relation to his care and treatment of Patient A. Rona was also found to have used social media to: (a) minimize the seriousness of COVID-19, (b) suggest the vaccines developed to protect against the virus were unsafe and did more harm than good, (c) deny the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the spread of COVID-19, (d) promote unproven treatments, (e) cite questionable sources around the issue of vaccine efficacy, (e) suggest the public was being scammed by medical experts and public officials, (f) make anti-Asian tweets about Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, and (g) call Dr. Anthony Fauci a \"murderer\" and a \"liar. \" Rona continues to operate a website that promotes health misinformation and selling supplements for a wide variety of health problems.

CBC News, Dec 16, 2022] Tijuana doctor charged with manslaughter for cosmetic surgery death. A doctor identified by reporters as Jes\u00fas Manuel B\u00e1ez L\u00f3pez has been charged in a Tijuana courtroom with manslaughter due to malpractice and negligence in the January 2021 death of 38-year-old Keuana Weaver, a mother of two from Long Beach, California. Weaver died on the operating table at Art Siluette Aesthetic Surgery while undergoing liposuction and a tummy tuck. The doctor was also charged for not having the necessary certification as a plastic surgeon to perform such cosmetic procedures under Baja California law. In April 2015, Mexico's Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks shut down Cl\u00ednica Santa Fe Medical Group (a cosmetic surgery clinic B\u00e1ez previously operated) and nine other clinics for \"failing to meet the minimum requirements to operate legally.\" Prosecutors argued: (a) a document explaining the risks of the cosmetic procedures was in Spanish, which was not Weaver's primary language, and (b) Weaver's signature was missing from key documents.

JAMA Network Open, Nov 23, 2022] The researchers concluded: There is a vast literature of original randomized trials and systematic reviews of randomized trials of acupuncture as a treatment for dozens of health conditions. Despite this, the number of conditions for which authors of systematic reviews have concluded that there is at least moderate-certainty evidence regarding health outcomes associated with acupuncture was modest, and most of these involved comparisons of acupuncture with sham or control acupuncture and mostly for painful conditions. The evidence that acupuncture causes adverse health effects was rare, and reviews that compared acupuncture with usual care and included conclusions about adverse effects all concluded that acupuncture was at least as safe or safer than usual care.

FDA announces enforcement priorities for homeopathic products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a final guidance describing the agency's approach to prioritizing regulatory actions for [homeopathic](https://quackwatch.org/homeopathy/) products marketed in the United States. [ [Homeopathic drug products: Guidance for FDA staff and industry](https://www.fda.gov/media/163755/download). FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, December 2022] The FDA has developed a risk-based approach to enforcement that gives priority to homeopathic products that potentially pose a higher risk to public health. These are products that: - have reports of injury that, after evaluation, raise potential safety concerns - contain or purport to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns - are not intended for oral or topical use, such as injectable products or products to be administered to eyes - are intended for prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases or conditions - are intended for vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised individuals, infants, children, the elderly, and pregnant women - have significant quality issues such as contamination with foreign materials or objectionable microorganisms and/or are made in facilities with significant deviations from Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements Most homeopathic products fall outside of these categories. No homeopathic products are FDA-approved, and there is no reason to believe they are effective. [Barrett S. [Homeopathy: The ultimate fake](https://quackwatch.org/related/homeo/). Quackwatch, Aug 25, 2016] Previously, the FDA warned the public about certain homeopathic products that contained a [toxic substance or were recalled due to contamination](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-alerts-consumers-and-pet-owners-silver-star-brands-voluntary-recall-homeopathic-drug-products).

Chiropractic regulatory decision judged \"unreasonable.\" Ontario's Health Professions Appeal and Review Board has concluded Ontario's chiropractic committee for reviewing patient complaints made an \"unreasonable\" decision regarding a complaint against a Timmins chiropractor. The case involved a woman who ended up in a diabetic coma after a year of treatment by chiropractor Wade Rafacz. [MacDonald D. [Timmins, Ont., woman who had chiropractor treat her diabetes ends up in a coma](https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/timmins-ont-woman-who-had-chiropractor-treat-her-diabetes-ends-up-in-a-coma-1.6171684). CTV News Northern Ontario, Nov 28, 2022] Evidence in the case indicates the patient sought help for insulin-dependent diabetes and was treated by Rafacz from October 2018 through November 2019. During this time, she claimed, Rafacz encouraged her to lower her insulin dosages. Although Rafacz told investigators he was not treating the woman's diabetes, his treatment notes contain references to understanding her sugar control, the \"DAWN Phenomenon,\" \"WD \"Sugar Demon.\" On the day before she went into a [diabetic coma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-coma/symptoms-causes/syc-20371475#:~:text=A%20diabetic%20coma%20is%20a,lead%20to%20a%20diabetic%20coma.), the patient saw Rafacz for an hour, during which she reported vomiting and was treated with vitamins, water, and an [activator](https://quackwatch.org/chiropractic/dd/activator/) device and was not advised to seek medical care. After investigating the situation, the Inquiries, Complaints and Reports Committee of Ontario's College of Chiropractors advised Rafacz to adhere to standards for scope of practice, recordkeeping, and communication with patients. No disciplinary action was taken. The Appeal and Review Board concluded the Committee's investigation was adequate, but its decision to merely give advice to Rafacz was unreasonable. [The appeal board's decision](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhparb/doc/2022/2022canlii111604/2022canlii111604.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAHdGltbWlucwAAAAAB&resultIndex=1#document) states: - The Committee failed to analyze whether Rafacz met the standard of care required of a chiropractor in failing to advise the patient to seek further medical attention. - It isn't clear whether the Committee's decision to advise Rafacz to adhere to the College's standard on scope of practice was based, in part, on a determination he acted outside the scope of practice, or whether it was based solely on a determination that his communications and record-keeping did not specifically say he was not treating the patient for diabetes and did not set out the scope of chiropractic treatment and the limits of his care. - It was unreasonable for the Committee to fail to indicate the appropriate standards of care in this situation and whether Rafacz met them. - The Committee should reconsider this matter and conduct any further investigation it deems necessary.

[Quackwatch has additional information about Mazi's conduct.](https://quackwatch.org/naturopath-arrested-for-fake-covid-19-vaccination-scheme/) Consumer protection lacking against naturopaths in Arizona. A judge has dismissed four out of five claims, including medical negligence and unlicensed practice of medicine, in a liposuction patient's malpractice lawsuit filed against Jose Ortiz, the [naturopath](https://quackwatch.org/naturopathy/) who performed the surgery. Only one claim (medical battery) remains. The patient alleged: (a) he could feel the surgery happening, and (b) the surgery healed in a lopsided manner leaving him scarred with hardened fluid around his abdomen that still causes him pain. His attorney believes the claims were dismissed because, according to [Arizona law 12-2604](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/12/02604.htm), he was required to find another naturopath who also performs cosmetic surgeries to serve as an expert witness in the case. The judge ruled neither a naturopath who had never done liposuction nor a plastic surgeon who had done liposuction could testify naturopaths are not qualified to perform liposuction. The plaintiff's attorney is calling on Arizona lawmakers to close this legal loophole. According to Ortiz's attorney: \"This patient has filed a total of 15 separate complaints against Dr. Jose Ortiz with the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board. The Board properly dismissed 14 of those complaints and did not discipline Dr. Ortiz or find he acted outside the scope of his license.\" Some naturopaths in Arizona also perform Brazilian butt lifts, an operation with a mortality rate as high as 4% and considered [one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures that exist](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/plastic-surgery-societies-issue-urgent-warning-about-the-risks-associated-with-brazilian-butt-lifts).

Lee (1895-1967), a nonpracticing dentist, founded and operated the Vitamin Products Company, which sold food supplements, and the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, which distributed literature on nutrition and health. The company, still family owned and operated, is now called [Standard Process, Inc](http://www.standardprocess.com). and located in Palmyra, Wisconsin. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Standard-Process-EI_IE760523.11,27.htm) estimates the company's annual gross sales to be between $100 and $500 million. Its catalogs have described the ingredients of its products as vitamins, minerals, protein isolates, glandular extracts, organ extracts, dried tissues, plant material, and plant extracts, singly or in various combinations. It currently sells supplements [1] , herbal products {2], and veterinary products [3]. A biographical sketch on the Standard Process Web site described Lee as a prolific inventor who registered more than 70 patents on equipment, processes, internal combustion engines, and food products [4]. He founded Standard Process in 1929 and his foundation in 1941. Lee's first product was Catalyn, a patent medicine composed of milk sugar, wheat starch, wheat bran, and other plant material. During the early 1930s, a shipment of Catalyn was seized by the FDA and destroyed by court order because it had been marketed with false claims of effectiveness against goiter, hardening of the arteries, heart trouble, high blood pressure, insomnia, prostate trouble, and other serious ailments. In 1945, the FTC ordered Lee and the Vitamin Products Company to discontinue illegal claims for Catalyn and other products. In 1956, the Post Office Department charged Lee's foundation with fraudulent promotion of a book called Diet Prevents Polio. The foundation agreed to discontinue the challenged claims. From 1961 through 1965, Lee received help in \"research development and marketing\" from Kurt W. Donsbach, D.C., who did literature research and gave nutrition seminars, primarily to chiropractors who were interested in marketing the company's products to their patients [5]. In 1962, Lee and Vitamin Products were convicted of misbranding 115 special dietary products by making false claims for the treatment of more than 500 diseases and conditions. Lee received a one-year suspended prison term and was fined $7,000. [6] Lee also consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting his use of claims for the products as well as claims such as \"Arthritis and tooth decay are caused by the eating of cooked foods\" and \"Some 700,000 people a year die of preventable and curable heart disease caused by deficiency of natural vitamins.\" [7] Lee had another brush with the FDA in connection with his marketing of a device he invented in 1937 called the Endocardiograph. The Endocardiograph (photo courtesy of the [Bakken Library and Museum](http://www.thebakken.org)) was an electrical amplifying and recording stethoscope used by chiropractors and other practitioners to \"diagnose\" disease and prescribe Lee's vitamin preparations as treatment. Literature describing the use of the device also claimed that practitioners could use it to \"detect and analyze\" enlargement of the heart, heart muscle fatigue, and diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies (which Lee alleged to include virtually all diseases). In 1963, the FDA initiated a seizure of three Endocardiographs in the possession of the Vitamin Products Company of Maryland (a distributor) along with promotional literature shipped by Lee's organizations. The Government charged that the labeling of the device contained statements that falsely represented it as effective in detecting vitamin deficiencies, high blood pressure and many other disease conditions [5]. In a speech on the day after the seizure had been made, Kenneth Milstead, Deputy Director of the FDA Bureau of Enforcement, described Lee as \"probably the largest publisher of unreliable and false nutritional information in the world.\" [8] Despite the conviction, Standard Process continued to market its products for the treatment of disease. In 1975, Sidney Wolfe, M.D., gave this testimony at a Congressional hearing on vitamin regulation: Although Standard Process Laboratories itself has allegedly stopped using a catalog, in a recent meeting at the National College of Chiropractic in Illinois, a booklet was distributed in which the students could fill in the blanks with the diseases to be treated by their companies after hearing an oral presentation by the company's detailmen. The \"health appraisal\" form, given out by the vitamin company salesmen is ostensibly to be used for the taking of the patient's history, and helps the chiropractor and any other person to elicit symptoms of gastroenterologic disease, nervous system diseases, and so forth. On the third page of this exhibit, the connection is made between symptoms elicited and vitamin\u2014drugs that should be used. . . . In addition to these materials, companies also use a catalog . . . in which the disease is listed alphabetically. Again, this whole catalog reviews every known condition and prescribes certain cures for the treatment. This catalog is similar to the Standard Process catalog . . . which caused the FDA to secure the consent decree against the company [9]. From about 1978 to 1980, a 15-hour course called The Doctor's Seminar on Nutrition was conducted by Richard Murray, D.C., and John Courtney. Brochures for the seminar described them as \"the two most knowledgeable men in nutrition available on the American scene today.\" Murray was said to practice \"more nutrition than any other doctor in America,\" using \"in excess of $200,000 of Standard Process products each year.\" Courtney was identified as a vice president of Standard Process Laboratories and \"the most knowledgeable man in nutritional research today.\" The brochures also said that Courtney had \"worked closely with Dr. Lee for more than 30 years\" and that in 1978, \"nearly a thousand doctors listened to Dr. Murray in seminar.\" [10] One of the seminar's subjects was \"successful handling of multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, impotency and mental disorders.\" [11] Food supplements have no legitimate role in the treatment of these conditions, but one of Lee's principles, listed in Standard Process's booklet \"Applications of Nutritional Principles for the Chiropractic Profession\" was: \"A fact need not be 'proved' to be useful.\" Tapes of the seminar were also offered to chiropractors for $175. In the 1980s, I also saw several manuals that practitioners could use to guide their product selection. Some involved the use of symptom questionnaires; others were \"cookbooks\" that matched health problems to products. Some manuals were published by people who hoped to profit from selling them. Other manuals were assembled and distributed free of charge by distributors who expected to benefit from product sales. None of the materials identified the company as their publisher, but one manual was sent by a regional distributor when I responded to an ad by Standard Process in a chiropractic journal. All made unsubstantiated claims that would be illegal on product labels, but independent authors generally have First Amendment protection and cannot be prosecuted for what they write. One of the most explicit systems included a 197-item symptom questionnaire [12] and a 55-page spiral-bound book that listed Standard Process products for each symptom in the questionnaire [13]. Since the mid-1980s, I have seen no evidence that Standard Process is making therapeutic claims directly. Instead, the claims have been made through distributors, lecturers, and publishers rather than directly through company publications. The company publicizes and/or sponsors many seminars for practitioners, but I don't know whether it could be held legally responsible for their contents. Since at least 2012, people who attend at least 100 hours of courses have been eligible for certification under an [\"applied clinical nutritionist (A.C.N.) program](http://www.spwestcoast.com/acn) co-sponsored by a few Standard Process distributors and chiropractic schools. Independent Promotion Bruce West, D.C., of Monterey, California, was an independent publisher who produced Health Alert newsletter and marketed supplements doing business as [Immune Systems](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=01278242-6165630). Some of his mailings contained explicit (and illegal) therapeutic claims for more than 50 Standard Process products that he was selling [14]. Similar claims were posted to his Health Alert Web site. In 1997, the U.S. Postal Service ruled that Health Alert did not qualify for the periodical postal rate because it was used to advertise products that he sold through another aspect of his business [15]. West died in October 2021 of a COVID-19 infection. Various websites have reported that he was not vaccinated against this disease. After his death, his website was redirected to that of Standard Process. In June 2021, the California Attorney General filed a civil suit charging West and Health Alert Immune Systems, Inc. with marketing dietary supplements with illegal claims that they are effective in preventing or curing many serious diseases [16]. In June 2022, West's estate and the company agreed to be bound by a stipulated judgment under which they would pay fines totaling $1.5 million, shut down the company, and refrain from making illegal claims for supplement products [17]. Another aggressive promoter was Dick A. Versendaal, D.C., of Holland, Michigan, whose seminars taught an elaborate pseudoscientific system of diagnosis and treatment called Contact Reflex Analysis (CRA). Versendaal claimed that a wide range of diseases can be diagnosed by testing the patient's arm strength while touching various \"reflex points\" on the patient's body. The findings were then used to prescribe regimens of Standard Process products that cost several dollars a day. Versendaal claimed that his approach could generate a million dollars a year working only 15 hours a week [18]. In 2000, I noted that a company called Nutricom was marketing \"software for the professional\" that provided supplement recommendations in response to various tests. Its \"Symptom Survey\"\u2014available online\u2014asked 197 questions about the frequency of symptoms, most of which have little or nothing to do with diet or nutrition. Other tests interpreted (or misinterpreted) the significance of various laboratory blood tests. The recommended \"nutrition support protocols\" were composed of products made by Standard Process. Nutricom claimed that the products facilitated \"healing and cell regeneration.\" Another prolific promoter is John R. Brady III of San Diego, California, who directs the [International Foundation for Nutrition and Health (IFNH)](http://www.ifnh.org) and also does business as the Acoustic CardioGraph Company. INFH markets reprints of Lee's writings and a computer program called Nutritec Software, which can help practitioners determine which products to recommend. In 2007, the software package included a \"Symptom Survey\" module with more than 200 questions about the patient's medical history and current symptoms. The manual for the software contains a disclaimer that statements mentioned in the software about Standard Process supplements \"are not expressed as the opinion of Standard Process\" or made by the company itself. Based on the results, the software recommends a program of dietary supplements and herbs that the practitioner can sell. Some \"symptoms\" are typical of various illnesses; others are not. To explore the test, I gave positive answers to \"sensitive to cold,\" \"hungry between meals,\" and \"slow pulse, below 65.\" My sensitivity to cold temperatures and hunger between meals are not abnormal. My pulse is slow\u201454 at rest\u2014because I am extremely fit. Yet, based on these answers, the [Nutritec report ](https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/nutritec(Xxx).pdf) suggested that I had significant glandular and \"sugar handling\" problems and recommended 15 products, the total cost of which would be $7 per day! [19] Brady's other company markets the Acoustic CardioGraph, which is said to be a modern (transistorized) version of Lee's Endocardiograph [20,21]. The company's Web site claims that the $6,600 device \"provides a readable signature of heart sounds\" that \"measures the heart as a reflection of balanced body chemistry\" and thus serves as an adjunct for recommending nutritional programs [22]. The [ Symptom Survey Maestro](http://www.surveymaestro.com), developed by Greene Software, is similar to Nutritec but may be more closely connected to Standard Process. The company's Web sites stated that the software evaluates the forms and \"suggests Standard Process and MediHerb supplementation based on a modified systems group analysis, actual clinical experience, and traditional application of whole-food nutrition and whole-extract herbal therapies.\" The practitioner also gets pre-filled order forms that it can send to Standard Process [23]. Ava Frick, DVM, CVC, FAIS, of Eureka, Missouri, was a \"veterinary product marketing consultant\" to Standard Process, Inc., from 2001 to 2011, during which time she presented seminars to veterinarians and chiropractors who practiced \"veterinary chiropractic.\" [24] In a lengthy video, she indicated that Standard Process's veterinary products are supported by an elaborate system of sales tools and instructional manuals [25]. The Bottom Line Standard Process products have been promoted with dubious claims for more than 50 years. After the company and its founder were prosecuted for criminal misbranding, the claims gradually became less traceable to the company. The products have been promoted for many conditions that are outside the legitimate scope of the practitioners (mainly chiropractors) who prescribe them. I advise people to avoid both the products and anyone who sells them. References [Product Guide](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/Standard-Process-Product-Guide-Single).

Ivermectin fails as COVID-19 treatment in major clinical trial. A randomized, double-blind trial (ACTIV-6) has found that the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin showed no significant advantage over placebo in shortening COVID-19 recovery times.

It concludes: OK, are we done with this drug yet? Is this nice U.S. randomized trial enough to convince people that results from a petri dish don't always transfer to humans, regardless of the presence or absence of an evil pharmaceutical cabal? No, of course not. At this point, I can predict the responses. The dose wasn't high enough. It wasn't given early enough. The patients weren't sick enough, or they were too sick. This is motivated reasoning, plain and simple. It's not to say that there isn't a chance that this drug has some off-target effects on COVID that we haven't adequately measured, but studies like ACTIV-6 effectively rule out the idea that it's a miracle cure. And you know what? That's OK. Miracle cures are vanishingly rare. Most things that work in medicine work OK; they make us a little better, and we learn why they do that and improve on them, and try again and again.

Eight former customers of F-Factor, the nutrition practice of registered dietitian Tanya Zuckerbrot, claim they have suffered a range of significant health issues on the extremely fiber-intensive weight-loss plan promoted by Zuckerbrot. The lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Zuckerbrot, two entities related to her, and Nutrablend Foods, the manufacturer of F-Factor's branded powders and bars. The plaintiffs allege: - \"On information and belief\" that F-Factor products have caused \"consumers and plaintiffs significant health issues, including. . . intestinal blockages requiring emergency surgery, gastric pain, rectal bleeding, intestinal bleeding, impaired liver function, malnutrition, hair loss, fecal impaction, exacerbation of gastrointestinal issues, loss of menstrual cycle, development of gallstones and kidney stones, [and] severe allergic reactions.\" - The diet company was negligent with respect to \"the safety and well-being of consumers and the general public\" by not adequately warning about \"the dangers of using F-Factor Products in the way Defendants' encouraged\" (including \"the risk of disordered eating\"). - F-Factor products were defective in manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and marketing, among other areas. - The company failed to warn customers, including the plaintiffs, of the possible dangers of consuming F-Factor products, by not including warnings on packaging as to proper usage, and telling consumers \"if they want to learn how to use the F-Factor powders properly, they must purchase Defendants' book The F-Factor Diet.\" - The plaintiffs falsely claim that \"out of 174,000 distinct orders in the last 2+ years, we have had only 50 health-related complaints, less than .03 percent of total orders.\" An attorney for Zuckerbrot, told The New York Times the lawsuit \"is based on allegations that have been clearly disproven by medical and scientific experts.\" However, researchers have criticized F-Factor and Zuckerbrot for promoting excessively high fiber, well above the 20 to 35 grams a day recommended by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and other leading health organizations.

The Editorial Board of The New York Times is calling for legislation to provide billions of dollars in funding to adequately support President John F.

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) has notified StellaLife, a company marketing a [homeopathic](https://quackwatch.org/homeopathy/) \"oral care recovery kit,\" to cease and desist referencing a [study published in AAOMS's official journal JOMS](https://www.joms.org/article/S0278-2391(19)30279-4/fulltext#%20) to imply endorsement of StellaLife. Mentions of JOMS have been removed from StellaLife's website except for a reference to the study among a list of 40 similar references. The cease-and-desist letter was prompted by complaints from Dr. Stephen Barrett and Professor William London to the editor of JOMS about the study's methodology and the conflicts of interest of Walter Tatch, DDS, the sole author. Tatch reported decreased opioid prescribing in his practice managing oral surgery pain after offering over-the-counter pain relievers in combination with the homeopathic treatment. The reduction in opioid prescribing cannot be attributable even in part to the homeopathic treatment. Tatch didn't report any measures of patients' pain levels.

Joe Schwarcz, PhD, Director of McGill University's Office for Science and Society, has looked closely at \"SightCare,\" a supposedly revolutionary stem-cell-enhancing dietary supplement composed of vitamins, minerals, herbal extracts, and other chemicals. David Lewis, a product spokesperson, claims in a lengthy video it can cure all vision problems and is \"divinely elegant, that it has nothing to do with embryos or unborn babies, and is 100% Christian approved.\" The video offers SightCare for the \"special price of $69 a bottle.\" It warns that later availability could not be guaranteed, since the eye care industry is expected to protect its profits by campaigning to prevent SightCare sales. Dr. Schwarcz concluded: Leaving all the hype aside, the fundamental question here is whether the claim that this specific composition of ingredients can cure all visual problems is backed by randomized, double-blind studies. There is a simple answer. No! The evidence we are furnished is an anecdote from. . . David Lewis that his failing eyesight was restored and that members of his church have also been happy with the product. I cannot say that SightCare cannot have some effect on sight, but I will go out on a limb and assert that it cannot eliminate glasses or cure eye diseases. Indeed, I think such unsubstantiated promises are criminal and make me see red, another problem that cannot be solved with SightCare. [Schwarcz J.

A recent article spotlights Longevity House, a private club in Toronto with a $100,000 lifetime membership fee. The club claims to provide members the possibility of living to 120 years free from chronic illness and mental decline. Activities at a gathering of members last fall included sipping \"brain-boosting\" beverages linked with lion's mane mushrooms garnished with grapefruit, breathwork, and soaking up electronic pulses of a $20,000 \"BioCharger\" device. That's the same device that Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans claimed could cure COVID-19. (Evans subsequently received a $25,000 fine for doing so from the Therapeutic Good Administration, the regulatory body in Australia.)

He is not a health professional. The article describes Nguyen and Longevity House members as engaging in biohacking\u2014to \"hack one's biology for the purposes of optimization\"\u2014which is New Age woo-woo wellness spiked with gadgetry. The author wrote: How genuine is Michael Nguyen? He certainly walks the walk, drinks the bone broth and bathes in the forest. He may actually have the cardiovascular system of a man half his age.

Exercise physiologist Nick Tiller, MRes, PhD, has examined the jargon-filled promotional claims and scientific evidence regarding kinesiology tape, also known as Kinesio Tape, KT Tape, or K-Tape, commonly used by athletes to stabilize injured joints. He concluded: When the omnipresence of K-tape in health and fitness is contrasted against the evidence for its benefit, the disparity is among the largest I have seen for any intervention, second only to chiropractic and homeopathy. Exactly how long this practice will endure, despite the damning evidence, remains to be seen, although if other pseudoscientific practices serve as an indication, K-Tape may be with us indefinitely. Notwithstanding, there is likely to be a potent placebo effect that some proponents will use to justify its continued use in the clinic. In fact, around 40 percent of athletic trainers and physiotherapists are already cognizant that K-tape works only via placebo. They use it anyway.

After reviewing recent research, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has updated and generally reaffirmed its 2016 recommendations on [statin drugs](https://medlineplus.gov/statins.html) for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD): - The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have one or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater. This recommendation is given with moderate certainty of at least moderate net benefit. - The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have one or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. - The USPSTF concludes the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

Chiropractic is a wide array of practices with emphasis on spinal \"adjustments.\" Chiropractic theory claims that (a) spinal misalignments, which chiropractors refer to as subluxations, impair health by interfering with the integrity of the nervous system and (b) spinal adjustments restore the integrity of the nervous system, enable the body's inherent recuperative power to restore health, and thereby prevent or remedy a wide range of health problems. Chiropractors may help people with certain musculoskeletal ailments, but the problems described in this chapter are widespread and, in some cases, integral to chiropractic philosophy and practice. Thus, even though some of the source materials and opinions cited in this essay originated long ago, they remain relevant to the current marketplace. Historical Perspective Various forms of spinal manipulation have been noted throughout recorded history [1]. The \"discovery\" of chiropractic was announced in 1895 by Daniel David (\"D.D.\") Palmer, a grocer, spiritualist, and \"magnetic healer\" who practiced in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer believed that he had restored the hearing of a deaf janitor by \"adjusting\" a hump on his spine. Even though the nerve that controls hearing is inside the skull and does not traverse the spine, Palmer concluded that the basic cause of disease was nerve interference caused by displaced vertebrae [2]. He originally declared that such misalignments cause abnormal tension (\"tone\") in the nearby nerves and that disturbed nerve tone causes 95% of all diseases. Later he elaborated a vitalistic doctrine which held that (a) \"Innate Intelligence,\" or \"nerve energy,\" flows throughout the nervous system and controls every bodily activity not under voluntary control; (b) even slight spinal misalignments hinder this flow, causing people to become ill; and (c) manual manipulation (\"adjustment\") of the spine is the remedy. He rejected the germ theory and had an aversion to drugs, surgery, and medical diagnosis. Palmer referred to spinal \"misalignments\" as \"luxations.\" A few years later a disciple began calling them \"subluxations,\" a term that became central to chiropractic theory and is still used today. The word \"chiropractic\" was derived from the Greek words cheir (hand) and praktikos (practice). Soon after his \"discovery,\" Palmer opened a school to teach his methods to others. The basic entrance requirement, as it was in many medical schools around the turn of the century, was the ability to pay tuition [3]. One of the first students was Palmer's son, Bartlett Joshua (\"B.J.\"), who became chiropractic's developer. In 1906 D.D. Palmer was convicted of practicing medicine without a license and spent 23 days in jail. After his release, B.J. denied him access to the school grounds and wound up purchasing D.D.'s interest in the Palmer School of Chiropractic. At that time about 100 chiropractors were practicing in the United States. Today there are about 65,000. Between 1913 and 1933, 40 states passed laws to license chiropractors; the remaining states gradually followed suit, with Louisiana being the last in 1974. Chiropractors have lobbied successfully in most states for laws that force insurance companies to pay for some of their services. In 1972 Congress legislated coverage under Medicare for \"treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation demonstrated by x-rays to exist.\" The International Chiropractors Association states that passage of this bill was spurred by more than 10 million letters received by members of Congress [4]. The x-ray requirement was eliminated in 2000. U.S. Census Bureau data indicate that the total reported income for chiropractic offices and clinics rose from $6.57 billion in 1997 to $11.4 billion in 2012. However, other data show that when inflation and other factors are taken into account, the average net income of chiropractors has dropped steadily [5]. Chiropractic Philosophy Chiropractic's uniqueness is not in its use of manipulation but in its theoretical basis for doing so. Jarvis describes chiropractic as \"a conglomeration of factions in conflict, bound together only by opposition to outside critics.\" [6] During the 1960s, Joseph A. Sabatier, M.D., who served for several years as chairman of the American Medical Association's Committee on Quackery, observed that, \"Chiropractic is the greatest tribute to the efficacy of technically applied public relations the world has ever known. These people have been delivering a package since 1895, the sale of which depends entirely on the wrapping. The contents are not there.\" [7] Philosophy and treatment methods vary greatly from one chiropractor to another, but there are two main types: \"straights\" and \"mixers.\" Straights tend to regard \"subluxations\" as the primary cause of ill health and spinal \"adjustments\" as the remedy. Some routinely manipulate the neck for complaints in all parts of the body. Many straights disparage medical diagnosis, some even claiming that their sole responsibility is to examine and adjust the spine. Mixers, who are more numerous, acknowledge that germs, hormones, and other factors play a role in disease; however, they tend to regard mechanical disturbances of the nervous system as the underlying cause (through lowered resistance). In addition to spinal manipulation, they may use measures that are standard in physical therapy as well as a wide spectrum of questionable nonmedical approaches. Mixers are more likely to diagnose medical conditions in addition to spinal abnormalities and to refer patients to medical practitioners for treatment. Both straights and mixers may claim that the nervous system is the master of all body functions, regulating everything from major organs to intricate cellular activities. This statement is untrue. However, charts and other materials relating the spine to the full range of illnesses can still be found in many chiropractic offices and online. Thus, even though nearly all chiropractors manipulate the spine as their primary treatment method, their rationales and techniques vary considerably. The spinal chart is from a chiropractic brochure. Many chiropractors use such charts to reinforce the idea that spinal problems are a major cause of disease. This one claims that \"spinal misalignments\" can cause more than 100 health problems, including allergies, amnesia, crossed eyes, deafness, gallbladder conditions, hernias, jaundice, and pneumonia. Other charts showing how nerves connect from the spine to the body's organs are used to persuade patients that regular spinal care is essential for good health. The message below is part of a chiropractic newspaper ad from the 1970s that illustrates chiropractic's tendency to overclaim. Many chiropractors detect \"subluxations\" in healthy individuals. A small percentage of chiropractors reject the subluxation concept and limit their practice to short-term treatment of musculoskeletal conditions using evidence-based procedures similar to those of physical therapists and osteopaths. Chiropractors also differ greatly about how treatment should be done. More than 200 \"technique systems\" have been advocated. In 1996, Thomas F. Bergmann, D.C., who edited the journal Chiropractic Technique, stated: A challenge for the future is to classify and place all chiropractic techniques into a framework that allows determination as to whether any of them has a basis in fact. . . . Studies designed to compare effectiveness have not been done. . . . No technique system has been demonstrated to be more or less effective than any other for any condition [8]. In 2011, Bergmann acknowledged that chiropractic research had not yet solved any these problems [9]. The two largest chiropractic organizations are the American Chiropractic Association (ACA, mixers) and the International Chiropractors Association (ICA, straights). Judging from their income tax returns and dues structures, the ACA appears to have about 8,000 members (not including students) and the ICA has about 2,500. The two groups have considered merging, but they are unable to agree on the definition and scope of chiropractic. The World Chiropractic Alliance, which has about 900 members, states that its mission is \"promoting a subluxation-free world.\" A small network of faculty members at some of the chiropractic colleges is attempting to place chiropractic on a scientific basis by determining which practices are valid and which are not. In 1995, Magner noted that negative research findings appeared to have little effect on what most chiropractors do [10]. That is still true today. The Elusive \"Subluxation\" Medical doctors and chiropractors use the word \"subluxation\" differently. The medical meaning is incomplete or partial dislocation\u00e2\u20ac\"a condition, visible on x-ray films, in which the bony surfaces of a joint no longer face each other exactly but remain partially aligned. Most partial dislocations occur in areas other than the spine and are the result of injury. Spondylolisthesis, a partial dislocation of a spinal bone, usually is congenital and causes no symptoms. Because the ligaments connecting the spinal bones are quite strong, vertebral dislocations rarely occur after birth and are unlikely without severe injury that would require surgical treatment, not chiropractic treatment. Chiropractors disagree on how their \"subluxations\" should be defined. Some describe them as \"bones out of place\" and/or \"pinched nerves,\" some speak of \"fixations\" and/or loss of joint mobility, some occupy a middle ground that includes any or all of these ideas, and a few renounce chiropractic's subluxation concepts completely. Chiropractors also disagree on whether their \"subluxations\" are visible on x-ray films. Those who claim that \"nerve interference\" results in too much or not enough \"nerve energy\" have never specified how this could be measured by scientific instruments. This children's storybook pictured to the right has been used to promote the notion that correcting subluxations promotes general health. After a chiropractor tells a little girl that she had a subluxation, she searches in vain under her bed and in her toybox to find it. She finally learns its location when the chiropractor says it was a bone in her neck that was \"not lined up with the other ones.\" The chiropractor explains: \"Subluxations make your body sick. Each time I push on your back, the bones are adjusted closer to their normal position. This opens up the pathways, so that your brain may talk properly with your body. As your subluxations are corrected, you become healthier.\" The booklet was marketed by a practice-building firm that promoted \"chiropractic pediatrics.\" The poster to the right has been used in chiropractic offices for more than 25 years to suggest that chiropractic care is necessary. A distributor calls it \"the most powerful single visual aid available.\" Chiropractors also differ among themselves about whether specific patients have subluxations and what to do about them. Several investigations in which many chiropractors have examined the same patient have found that the diagnoses and proposed treatments differed greatly from one practitioner to another [11]. - In 1989 Dr. William M. London visited 23 chiropractors in Ohio and Florida who had advertised free consultations or examinations. Each one espoused subluxation theory either during the consultation or in waiting room literature, and all but two recommended periodic preventive maintenance. Seventeen performed examinations. Of these, three identified subluxations (at differing locations), three said his left leg was shorter than his right leg, and two said his right leg was shorter than his left. Seven recommended treatment, and one treated him with a motorized roller device before examining him. - In 1994 ABC's \"20/20\" reported on visits to 17 chiropractors who had made it known through advertising or other means that they treated children. In one segment, an infant named Blake was taken by his mother to 9 chiropractors in the New York metropolitan area, accompanied by a \"friend\" who was carrying a hidden camera. Blake had experienced recurring ear infections, a problem that a pediatrician said could be managed with antibiotics and would eventually be outgrown. Every chiropractor found a problem, and all said they could help and recommended care ranging from several weeks to a lifetime. The first found \"a misalignment between the second and third bones in his neck.\" The second said it was \"on the right side of his neck between the first and second bones.\" The third, using muscle-testing, found \"weakness in the adrenal glands.\" The fourth said there was a subluxation because one of Blake's legs was shorter than the other. The fifth claimed he could diagnose the boy's problem by pulling on his mother's arm while she touched the boy on the shoulder. The sixth chiropractor did a similar test by pulling on the mother's legs while Blake lay on top of her back. After diagnosing \"jamming of the occiput (the back bone of the skull),\" the chiropractor said he corrected it by \"lifting\" Blake's occiput with his thumbs. He also said (a) Blake needed work on his immune system, (b) a learning disorder might be a problem, (c) both mother and son had \"eyes that don't team too well,\" and (d) the cameraman, whom the chiropractor incorrectly assumed was the boy's father, had the same eye problem. - The same program also reported on visits to eight Wisconsin chiropractors by a 5-year-old boy with chronic ear infections so severe that medical doctors wanted to insert tubes in his ears to drain them. All eight chiropractors found problems, but not usually the same ones. One diagnosed a pinched nerve in the boy's neck. Another said his left leg was shorter than his right. Another said his right leg was shorter than his left. Another diagnosed zinc deficiency. Another chiropractor blamed the boy's ear problems on \"food sensitivities\" and advised avoiding corn, cow's milk, and white flour. Another gave similar dietary advice but said that the main diagnosis was a \"subluxation\" in the top vertebra. Another said the boy didn't have an ear problem but had scoliosis\u00e2\u20ac\"a diagnosis disputed by a pediatrician and a radiologist who reviewed this chiropractor's findings. - In 2001, a healthy 11-year-old girl was taken by her uncle (a reporter) to five chiropractors in Toronto, Canada, for a checkup. The chiropractors were told the child was generally in good health but suffered from a few earaches, some mild headaches, and a few signs of allergy symptoms. The chiropractors were also told that the girl's mother was worried about the possibility of asthma and had heard from neighbors that chiropractic care could be beneficial for children. Four of the chiropractors found different subluxations and said that the girl needed chiropractic adjustments to get healthy. The methods they used to locate the alleged subluxations included spinal palpation, thermographic scans (looking for heat differences), and surface electromyography (SEMG), which merely measures muscle electrical activity. Among other things, the chiropractors said the child had one shoulder lower than the other, one leg longer than the other, one hip higher than the other, one ear lower than the other, something called \"anterior head carriage,\" scoliosis, early osteoarthritis, and numerous subluxations, all of which could cause earaches, headaches, allergies, asthma, arthritis, learning problems, and more serious problems later in life, including digestive and reproductive problems. - In 2004 a team of high school students contacted chiropractic offices in metropolitan Portland, Oregon, and found evidence of unscientific practice in every one. Following a script, they posed as a prospective patient and telephoned 42 local offices. All questions were answered by a member of the chiropractor's office staff, who sometimes consulted with the chiropractor. The students reported that all routinely or usually took x-rays during the first visit, 40 said they treated \"subluxations,\" 41 recommended \"maintenance\" adjustments, 38 offered craniosacral therapy, 37 recommended treatment for newborn infants, 29 treated newborns, and at least 28 did not recommend routine vaccination for children. Some physical therapists, athletic trainers, osteopathic physicians, and medical doctors use manipulative techniques. However, their intent is never to correct subluxations; it is to relieve pain and secondary muscle spasm by restoring the mobility of joints that have a mechanical malfunction. The notion that nerve interference is a major cause of disease clashes with established anatomic facts. During the early 1970s, Dr. Edmund Crelin, a prominent anatomist at Yale University, subjected subluxation theory to an actual test [12]. After collecting the spines of six people who had died a few hours earlier, he twisted them with instruments and observed the spaces between the vertebrae through which the spinal nerves passed. No nerve compression occurred, regardless of the force applied. In a later memorandum he commented further: Only 24 of the 43 pairs of nerves that pass from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body could ever be impinged upon in the [vertebral openings] by the excessive displacement of vertebrae. Why these 24 pairs should be causing disease, exclusive of all the others, defies a rational explanation. . . . Complete severance of spinal nerves to the heart, glands (salivary, thyroid, liver, pancreas, etc.) and smooth muscles of the lungs, stomach, intestines, etc., has only transient effects. The gland cells and smooth and cardiac muscles not only survive, but function normally. They surely do not become diseased [13]. Despite the unscientific nature of the subluxation concept, surveys have found that large percentages of chiropractors still cling to it. - In 2002, a cross-sectional survey of North American chiropractors conducted in 2002 found that (a) 88.1% thought that the term vertebral subluxation should be retained, (b) 89.8% thought that spinal adjustment should not be limited to treating musculoskeletal conditions, and (c) 62.1% rated the subluxation as a significant contributing factor in visceral conditions (diseases of the internal organs), and (d) 76.5% taught patients about a relationship between subluxations and visceral health [14]. - In 2006, in a randomized sample of US chiropractors, 70% of practitioners said their clinical practices were \"subluxation-centered\" and 59% agreed that the concept of subluxation was important to their clinical care decisions [15]. - In 2015, a survey of North American chiropractic students reported that more than 60% agreed or strongly agreed that the emphasis of chiropractic intervention is to eliminate vertebral subluxations [16]. - A survey conducted between 2018 and 2020 concluded that 56.8% of the 3,538 who responded were \"spine/neuromusculoskeletal-focused,\" 21.2% were vertebral subluxation focused.\" Although these numbers might indicate a sharp drop in subluxation focus, the authors noted that some chiropractors in the first two groups still subscribed to subluxation beliefs [17]. Mainstream chiropractic organizations are also strongly tied to the subluxation concept. In 2000, the ACA House of Delegates reaffirmed its core principle of subluxation by passing this resolution: The ACA will strive to reiterate this principle and further state that the core treatment of chiropractic is manual manipulation/adjustment of the articulations, both spinal and extra-spinal, to reduce subluxations, when called upon in relation to Federal legislative efforts, in addition to full scope of practice as allowed by state law. References to subluxation and chiropractic adjustments/manipulation should be made in ACA releases, whenever possible. In 1996, in an attempt to unify the profession, the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) adopted a subluxation-based \"chiropractic paradigm\" statement that contains this definition: A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence [18]. In 2005, the World Federation of Chiropractic, an association of chiropractic organizations in 85 countries, adopted an \"identity statement\" based on a survey in which thousands of chiropractors were asked how the public should perceive them. The survey found that 65% of respondents said that the phrase \"management of vertebral subluxation and its impact on general health\" fits chiropractic \"perfectly\" or almost perfectly [19]. Subluxation theory is not only entrenched in the practices of chiropractors; it is also embodied in all 50 of the state laws that govern chiropractic regulation. Twenty-states authorize chiropractors to treat subluxations, 25 authorize them to treat purported vertebral malpositions that interfere with nerve flow (or similar wording), and five authorize the use of whatever is taught at chiropractic colleges [20]. As a result, all states permit chiropractors to treat all or most diseases by adjusting subluxations to improve nerve flow. Chiropractic Education In 1973 the U.S. Office of Education approved the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) to accredit chiropractic schools. In 2018, the requirements for admission to a CCE-accredited school included 90 credit hours (about 3 years) of prechiropractic college education with at least a 3.0 (out of 4.0) grade-point average [21]. To receive the doctor of chiropractic (D.C.) degree, students must complete at least 4,200 hours of study over a 4-year period. Courses include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, public health, diagnosis and x-ray examination, related health sciences, and chiropractic principles and practice. Seventeen chiropractic programs in the United States have CCE accreditation. In 1968 a comprehensive study by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare concluded that chiropractic education did not prepare its practitioners to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment [22]. Chiropractic colleges have improved considerably since that time. However, all still discuss subluxations in their philosophy courses, some consider subluxations to be real entities, and a few still encourage students to treat \"subluxations\" rather than diseases or \"conditions.\" [23] The ACC paradigm statement says, \"Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on the subluxation.\" [18] The statement was signed by all of the U.S. chiropractic college presidents in 1996 and is still considered current. In 2018, researchers who investigated 46 chiropractic programs (18 in the United States and 28 elsewhere) found that among the U.S. programs, the average number of mentions of \"subluxation\" in course titles and descriptions was 7. Those with the most mentions were Life University (25), Sherman College of Chiropractic (18), and the Palmer College of Chiropractic\u2014Florida (17). \"Subluxation\" was mentioned by only a few the 18 non-U.S. programs. The research team concluded: Unscientific terms and concepts should have no place in modern health care education, except perhaps in discussions with historical context. Unless these outdated concepts are rejected, the chiropractic profession and individual chiropractors will likely continue to face difficulties integrating with established health care systems and attaining cultural authority as experts in conservative neuromusculoskeletal health care [24] Chiropractic colleges do not provide the depth of diagnostic and therapeutic training that physicians receive. Whereas most medical school faculties are large and contain experts in every aspect of medical practice, chiropractic colleges have few or no physicians on their faculty. Whereas the patients studied by medical students encompass the full range of disease, the vast majority seen by chiropractic students seek help for musculoskeletal problems. Although many of their courses are based on standard medical textbooks, chiropractic students lack much of the experience needed to make the information meaningful [25]. Some chiropractors try to downplay their lack of clinical experience by claiming that they spend more hours than medical students do in one subject or another. These claims are misleading because nearly all medical doctors undergo at least 3 additional years of full-time clinical training before going into practice, whereas nearly all chiropractors enter practice directly after graduation from their 4-year program. Moreover, in chiropractic colleges, instruction in many subjects, including pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology, is confined to the classroom, with little or no actual patient contact and no experience with hospitalized patients [25]. A team of research-oriented chiropractors recently stated: There is a tremendous void in how chiropractic graduates develop any meaningful hands-on clinical experience with real patients in real life situations. The chiropractic profession has an obligation to actively divorce itself from metaphysical explanations of health and disease as well as to actively regulate itself in refusing to tolerate fraud, abuse and quackery, which are more rampant in chiropractic than in other healthcare professions.\" [25] Critics also note that because much of chiropractic is based on a false premise, neither length of study nor accreditation of its schools can ensure that those who graduate will practice competently. Practice-Building Techniques After graduation many chiropractors take courses to help build their practices. These courses teach efficient office management, but some have taught unethical methods of recruiting and retaining patients. For example, one practice-building manual advised that \"Every action the chiropractor does should have the one purpose to slowly but surely direct the patient's attention to the fact that chiropractic is capable of correcting the 'condition' that is 'causing' the patient's ill health\" and provided detailed instructions for persuading all comers to have monthly spinal examinations [27]. Another suggested telling patients that \"the best health insurance you'll ever buy is regular adjustments of your spine, releasing nerve pressures.\" [28] Both of these books were authored by chiropractic college presidents and widely used for more than 30 years.\u00c2 Although neither book is still published, most current practice-builders teach the same techniques and thousands of chiropractors use them. A 1986 report by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that \"practice-building courses, popular with many chiropractors, advocate advertising techniques which suggest the universal efficacy of chiropractic treatment for every ailment known to humans.\" It also concluded that despite evidence of an increased emphasis on science and professionalism in the training and practice of chiropractors, \"there also exist patterns of activity and practice which at best appear as overly aggressive marketing\u2014and, in some cases, seem deliberately aimed at misleading patients and the public regarding chiropractic care.\" [29] A 1989 OIG report noted that the two most common reasons for disciplinary actions by state chiropractic boards were billing abuses (relating to utilization or fees) and advertising abuses [30]. Many chiropractors use messages that reinforce the idea of a special bond between themselves and their patients. The bumper sticker shown below was distributed by the American Chiropractic Association. The heart sticker is from a company that sells novelty items to chiropractors. Several companies sell birthday cards and other greeting cards with chiropractic themes. Research Findings Many studies have examined whether spinal manipulation can relieve back pain. Relatively few studies have looked at whether manipulation could help other problems. In properly selected cases, manipulation may relieve low-back pain of musculoskeletal origin. However, there is little evidence that it is effective for other musculoskeletal conditions and no evidence that it is effective for nonmusculoskeletal conditions. Homola has noted that \"chiropractic research has yet to pinpoint\u00c2 what chiropractors do that is beneficial.\" [31] During the early 1990s, manipulation received considerable publicity after reviews by the RAND Corporation [32] and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) [33] concluded that manipulation was effective for acute low-back pain in patients with no signs of lower-limb nerve root involvement. Although chiropractors promoted these reports as endorsements of chiropractic, they were not. They merely supported the use of manipulation in carefully selected patients. Only a few of the studies on which their conclusions were based involved manipulation by chiropractors; most were done by medical doctors and physical therapists whose practices were not identical to those of chiropractors [10]. Since that time, there have been many more studies and many more reviews. In 2003, a team that included RAND's project leader concluded: \"There is no evidence that spinal manipulation is superior to other standard treatments for patients with acute or chronic low back pain.\" [34] In 2005, after looking at 19 reviews related to back pain, Canter and Ernst concluded that \"those authored by chiropractors tended to generate positive results, whereas the others failed to demonstrate effectiveness.\" [35] In 2006, Ernst and Canter reported on 16 systematic reviews of clinical trials of spinal manipulation published between 2000 and May 2005 on back pain, neck pain, headache, non-spinal pain, menstrual pain, infantile colic, asthma, allergy, neck-related dizziness, and medical problems in general. They concluded: These reviews were largely negative, except for back pain where spinal manipulation was considered superior to sham manipulation but not better than conventional treatments. . . . Collectively these data do not demonstrate that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition. Given the possibility of adverse effects, this review does not suggest that spinal manipulation is a recommendable treatment [36]. A 2010 Cochrane review examined the effect of manipulation plus other modalities on low-back pain. The other modalities were heat and cold therapy, electrotherapy, mechanical devices, exercise, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification, and patient education. The reviewers concluded that although combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute and subacute low-back pain, \"there is currently no evidence to support or refute that combined chiropractic interventions provide a clinically meaningful advantage over other treatments for pain or disability in people with low-back pain.\" [37] A 2011 review drew similar conclusions for chronic low-back pain [38]. Although a 2019 Cochrane Review was slightly more favorable [39], Ernst concluded that the analysis was severely flawed and:: - The lead author and second author of the review team were chiropractors who had significant conflicts of interest, - The review actually produced no good evidence that spinal manipulation has effects beyond placebo. - Spinal manipulative therapy is still not supported by convincing evidence for back (or other) problems and does not qualify as the treatment of choice [40]. Little has been written about the fact that studies of manipulation in research settings may not reflect what takes place in typical chiropractic offices. Patients in research studies are likely to be better screened for appropriateness and are highly unlikely to face the many things that chiropractors do wrong in their offices. So even if manipulation is proven useful for carefully selected patients, consulting chiropractors outside of research settings may still be problematic. Problems for Consumers Although some research on the use of spinal manipulation is favorable, the situation faced by consumers is actually worse than these studies might seem to indicate. Most research on spinal manipulation is done in studies where the patients are appropriately screened and the treatment is limited by the experimental protocol. In the real world, however, the odds of getting appropriate treatment are much lower because the following problems are widespread. I have also noted that chiropractors seldom react constructively to criticism. When specific wrongdoings are exposed, they typically claim that the criticized practices are not representative, or that the critic is biased, or they attack the medical profession [41]. Exaggerated Scope Many chiropractors exaggerate what they can achieve. Tedd Koren, D.C., publishes many brochures and other practice-building supplies, one of which states: Nearly every condition to which the flesh is heir has responded to chiropractic, including ear infections, asthma, allergies, colic, bedwetting, hearing problems, skin conditions, digestive and menstrual problems, infertility, spine and nerve pain, colds and flu, headache, sciatica, emotional and neurological conditions and many others [42]. Koren also advised chiropractors they could double their practice \"practically overnight\" by having patients read one of his lists of conditions treated and asking: \"Do you know of any children, perhaps your own, or those of relatives or friends, that have any of the problems in this list?\" [43] A recent survey found that unsubstantiated claims are very common among chiropractic Web sites. In the fall of 2008, the researchers looked at the sites of 200 chiropractors and 9 chiropractic associations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each site was examined for claims which suggested that chiropractic treatment was appropriate for asthma, colic, ear infection/earache/otitis media, neck pain, whiplash, headache/migraine, and lower back pain. The study found that 95% of the surveyed sites made unsubstantiated claims for at least one of these conditions and 38% made unsubstantiated claims for all of them. The authors concluded: The majority of chiropractors and their associations in the English speaking world seem to make therapeutic claims that are not supported by sound evidence, while only 28% of chiropractor websites promote lower back pain, which is supported by some evidence. We suggest the ubiquity of the unsubstantiated claims constitutes an ethical and public health issue [44]. Patients who rely on exaggerated chiropractic claims may delay obtaining more appropriate care. Modde highlighted this problem when he said that \"malpractice is an inevitable result of chiropractic philosophy and training.\" [45] Unnecessary Treatment Many chiropractors claim that treating subluxations improves general health and is important throughout life. For example, in 1995 an ACA board member stated: \"I treat my patients as if each spinal adjustment has a virtually unlimited potential in improving their health. My father adjusted me on the day that I came home from the hospital, and I did the same with my children.\" [46] Many chiropractors suggest unnecessary \"spinal adjustments\" for \"preventative maintenance\" or for treating nonexistent conditions. Maintenance care is typically promoted with claims that undetected subluxations pose a serious health threat. A 2009 Koren pamphlet, for example, states: \"Subluxations are sometimes referred to as 'silent killers' because they can slowly eat away at your health and vitality for years without your knowing it.\" [47] Many chiropractors offer free evaluations with the hope that takers will contract for long-term care. These offers may be communicated through mall exhibits, free dinners, newspaper advertising, and various other channels. The \"danger signal\" ad shown below is from a telephone directory. It is misleading because (a) most of the listed symptoms are unlikely to be caused by pinched nerves, (b) most cases involving these symptoms are not serious, and (c) some of the symptoms (such as difficult breathing) are far more likely to be appropriate for medical rather than chiropractic evaluation. Contour analysis has no diagnostic value. The in-office sales pitch typically includes a recommendation for 50 to 100 visits over a 6- to 12-month period to promote wellness and/or prevent spinal degeneration. To increase compliance and discourage patients from stopping if their initial symptoms resolve, patients are offered a discount is they pay in advance for a specified number of treatments. As illustrated by the following case, such arrangments are usually a bad idea: In 2008, in response to an advertisement, Gertrude West, a 76-year-old retired attorney, sought help from a chiropractor for knee pain. The chiropractor performed a cursory examination, some diagnostic tests, and an x-ray examination and advised West that she had \"subluxation degeneration\" that would worsen without intensive chiropractic care. The chiropractor's written report of findings called for 100 visits at a total cost of $7080, but if she signed a contract and paid in advance the price would be discounted (15%) to $6,354. After 49 visits over a 4-month period, West concluded that she was not being helped and asked that payment for the unused visits be refunded. When the chiropractor refused, she sued him in small claims court. The contract GlimWest signed said that if she stopped before the 100 visits were completed, she would be charged at a nondiscounted rate for the visits she had and an additional 10% \"administrative fee.\" However, the judge ruled that the penalty clause was \"unconscionable\" and that West had been misled and was entitled to a full refund. A small claims appeal judge reduced the award to $4,589 but agreed that the contract was unreasonable. Chiropractors who offer \"discount\" plans should be avoided because such plans are a sign of overselling. Even when chiropractic treatment can be helpful, it is not possible to know in advance that a large specified number of visits will be needed. Some patient-recruitment programs have been packaged as an opportunity to participate in research. In 2008, for example, several chiropractic Web sites began advertising for \"research volunteers\" who would be evaluated free of charge. After the evaluation, they would then be invited\u2014as paying patients\u2014to \"commit to a 24-visit cycle, and continue coming until they reach their maximum potential.\" The ads are part of a practice-building program offered by Research & Clinical Science (RCS), which promised chiropractors that it would tabulate data that would ultimately pinpoint \"exactly what impact subluxations have on the body, and what benefits chiropractic might offer to people of various ages and health levels.\" RCS also promised that its program would generate between 10 and 25 new patients a month and promote long-term wellness and compliance among existing patients. To join the program, chiropractors would pay $7384 in advance or up to $8384 for an installment plan. In return, RCS provided the training, research technology, wall plaque, brochures, and other materials needed to represent themselves as \"RCS Authorized Clinical Investigators.\" [48] A real investigation of whether chiropractic can prevent disease in general found no evidence that it has done so [49]. Opposition to Immunization Many chiropractors say that vaccinations are ineffective and do not recommend them to their patients. In 1992, 36% of 178 chiropractors who responded to a survey agreed that \"there is no scientific proof that immunization prevents infectious disease\" and 23% said they were uncertain. In the same survey, 41% agreed that \"immunization campaigns have not substantially changed the incidence of any infectious diseases in the 20th century\" and 29% said they were unsure [50]. A more recent study looked at vaccination rates obtained from insurance data compiled in the state of Washington from 2000 to 2003. The researchers found that vaccination rates were much lower among children who saw chiropractors and naturopaths than among those who relied only on medical doctors [51]. The ACA, ICA, WCA, and International Chiropractic Pediatric Association oppose compulsory vaccination, and all but the ACA distribute anti-vaccination publications [52] Dubious Practices and Procedures - Many chiropractors use leg-length measurement, thermography, surface electromyography, or other dubious methods to detect alleged subluxations. The Chirobase Web site (www.chirobase.org) has detailed reports on these methods. - Many chiropractors use applied kinesiology muscle-testing, hair analysis, or other dubious methods as a basis for prescribing unnecessary vitamins, irrational \"dietary supplement\" formulations, herbs, and/or homeopathic products, most of which are sold to patients at two or three times their wholesale cost. - Many chiropractors x-ray most or all of their patients to look for \"subluxations.\" About 10% of chiropractors still obtain 14 x 36-inch full-spine x-ray films, which yield little or no diagnostic information and involve relatively high levels of radiation. - A 2003 survey by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners found that 89% of 2167 full-time practitioners who responded said they had used \"nutritional counseling, therapy or supplements\" within the previous year and that 46.4% said they had prescribed homeopathic remedies [53]. - Although not qualified by training to understand the use of prescription drugs, many chiropractors discourage their use. Consumer Reports has advised people to be suspicious of any chiropractor who does the following: - Takes full-spine or repeated x-rays - Fails to take a comprehensive history and perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of your trouble - Claims that the treatment will improve immune function, benefit organ systems, or cure disease - Offers to sell you vitamin cures, nutritional remedies, or homeopathic remedies - Solicits children or other family members - Advises against the immunization of children - Wants you to sign a contract for long-term care - Promises to prevent disease through regular checkups and spinal adjustments [54] Adverse Effects of Spinal Manipulation Most chiropractors manipulate the vast majority of patients who visit their office; some use techniques that have not been studied scientifically, and many emphasize a technique that is more vigorous (and therefore potentially less safe) than the controlled manipulation used by other practitioners. Manipulation, particularly of the neck, can be dangerous. In 1992 researchers at the Stanford Stroke Center asked 486 California members of the American Academy of Neurology how many patients they had seen during the previous 2 years who had suffered a stroke within 24 hours of neck manipulation by a chiropractor. The survey was sponsored by the American Heart Association. The 176 neurologists who responded said that they had treated 56 such patients, all between the ages of 21 and 60. One patient had died, and 48 were left with permanent neurologic deficits such as slurred speech, inability to arrange words properly, and vertigo (severe dizziness). The neurologists also reported treating 46 cases of nerve or muscle injury [55]. Although the percentage of chiropractic patients who are seriously injured is small, injury caused by an unnecessary manipulation is inexcusable. In 1995, Assendelft and colleagues reviewed 295 published reports of complications and concluded (a) it is difficult to estimate the incidence of complications of spinal manipulation because they are underreported in the scientific literature, (b) information about the risk of stroke should be included in an informed consent procedure for neck manipulation that involves thrusting, and (c) practitioners using rotatory manipulation should be avoided [56]. In 2008, Ernst reported that seven prospective studies had found that about half of the patients who received spinal manipulation experienced mild-to-moderate, transient adverse effects [57]. Local or radiating pain, headache, and tiredness occurred most often. Spinal manipulation can also result in serious injury to nerves, disc herniation, and, with neck manipulation, dissection of the vertebral artery followed by stroke [58]. Severe injuries are uncommon, but their actual incidence is unknown [59]. Excessive Use of X-Ray Examinations A recent review concluded that (a) in the vast majority of cases who present to chiropractors, the potential benefit from spinal X-rays does not outweigh the potential harms and (b) spinal x-rays should not be performed as a routine part of chiropractic practice [60]. A Plea for Reform In 2016, [Bruce F. Walker, D.C., Dr.P.H.](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/bruce-walker/), who heads the chiropractic program at Murdoch University (Australia), urged chiropractors to adopt a 10-point plan for \"a new chiropractic\" that would achieve full acceptance for his \"troubled profession.\" His report includes a list of \"bad\" practices that continue to cause significant reputational damage to the profession: - Adherence to a flawed chiropractic ideology centering on \"innate intelligence\" and vitalism - Anti-vaccination propaganda - Anti-physiotherapy sentiments - Over-servicing, including unnecessary treatment of babies - Use of the term \"subluxation\" as a valid diagnosis - Biologically implausible diagnostic tests and therapies without supporting evidence - Lifetime chiropractic care in the name of \"wellness\" - Claims of cures for visceral and other non-musculoskeletal conditions - Anti-drug and anti-medicine propaganda - Misleading and deceptive advertising - Unscrupulous contracts of care - Obligatory full-spine x-rays - Unfounded claims of decreased immunity from \"subluxation\" and increased immunity from chiropractic treatment - An unhealthy disregard of clinical research, evidence based practice, and non-specific treatment effects including natural history and the placebo effect Walker's proposed plan included \"marginalization of the nonsensical elements within the profession,\" unequivocal support of proven public health measures, increased research, and unambiguous statements from chiropractic organizations that support science and evidence [61]. His suggestions are excellent, but there is little reason to believe that most chiropractors will follow them. Some Final Thoughts The terms \"chiropractic\" and \"chiropractic treatment\" are ambiguous and are not synonymous with \"spinal manipulation.\" Chiropractic is both a philosophy and a treatment approach. Chiropractic treatment may include a wide variety of dubious measures in addition to appropriate or inappropriate manipulation. Thus, the potential usefulness of spinal manipulation may not counterbalance the unscientific philosophy or methods commonly embraced by chiropractors. References - Lomax E.

Associated Press, Aug 18, 2022] A recent article described false and misleading information in an article published on the Children's Health Defense website. [Mole B. [Anti-vaccine activists giddily celebrate as poliovirus spreads in NY](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/anti-vaccine-activists-giddily-celebrate-as-poliovirus-spreads-in-ny/).

Vitamin D supplementation failed to lower fracture risk. A randomized clinical trial has found vitamin D supplements had no significant effect on total fractures, nonvertebral fractures, or hip fractures. The study followed more than 25,000 men and women who were at least 50 years old for a median time of 5.3 years. About half were given 2,000 international units of vitamin D while the others received a placebo. The trial was an ancillary study of VITAL, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial, that tested the effectiveness of supplementation for preventing cancer and heart disease. The 20% of participants who also took calcium were not found to have better outcomes. No benefit of supplemental vitamin D3 on fracture risk was found regardless of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the blood serum at the start of the study. Results of previous trials of vitamin D on fracture risk have had inconsistent findings. [LeBoff MS, and others. [Supplemental vitamin D and incident fractures in midlife and older adults](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106). New England Journal of Medicine 387:299-309, 2022] An editorial about the study concluded: A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level might be a useful diagnostic test for some patients with conditions that may be due to or that may cause severe deficiency. For example, persons living in residential settings with little or no sunlight exposure or malabsorption or those receiving treatments for osteoporosis that might cause hypocalcemia may benefit from vitamin D supplementation; the need for measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in these groups remains uncertain. Otherwise, the use of the terms vitamin D \"insufficiency\" and \"deficiency\" should now be reconsidered. What are the implications of VITAL? The fact that vitamin D had no effect on fractures should put to rest any notion of an important benefit of vitamin D alone to prevent fractures in the larger population. Adding those findings to previous reports from VITAL and other trials showing the lack of an effect for preventing numerous conditions, suggests that providers should stop screening for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or recommending vitamin D supplements, and people should stop taking vitamin D supplements to prevent major diseases or extend life.
