The reason for this has to do with several factors; One is the fact that they don't have to deal with the stress of modern society including everything we see on TV like violence, \"bad\" news, Jerry Springer, and other TV shows revealing low aspects of our society. We take for granted the technology we have today, but yet the Amish seem to be living peaceful lives. Also, they are not sitting behind a desk all day drinking coffee and working from 9-5; they are naturally getting their exercise by working in the fields, construction, or other trades that consist of physical activity. How many times have you seen an Amish person sitting next to you at the Doctor's office? Well, not to many and it is because they also eat healthy diets consisting of food that they grow on their own which lack environmental toxins which are in the produce we see commercially. Finally, there must be some kind of secret they have when it comes time to treating common ailments like the common cold, minor cuts/bruises, muscle aches and pains, and much more. Well, I have discovered some of these \"natural home health remedies\" which some have been passed on to me from my great-grandma Princess Poorman who had these remedies passed down from her mother that lived like the Amish back in the Indian civilization days. Here are some of those remedies: Shingles Lavender oil applied directly to skin for itch and pain. (Also Tea Tree oil). Cold - Put 3 teaspoons of eucalyptus leaves in a heatproof bowl. - Pour 41/4 pint of boiling water onto herbs and soak a bit. 3- Place your head over the bowel and cover the bowl with a towel. Inhale through nose for 10 minutes. Cold Sores Undiluted lemon juice dabbed onto a cold sore will sting but help heal. Heartburn/Indigestion Peppermint Ice cream after meals. Headaches 1- lightly crush 4oz of black mustard seed in a bowl big enough for your feet 2- Pour in hot water and soak feet for as long as it feels comfortable 3- Place a cold cloth on the front of your head and back of your neck while your feet are soaking. Kidney Infections A glass of cranberry juice daily to prevent kidney and bladder infections. Bites/Stings Apply seasoning salt to a bee sting to reduce pain and swelling.Garlic and onion with cucumber juice for ant bites. Cotton batting soaked in lemon juice for a wasp sting. Sprains/Strains Take some castor oil and put it into a cloth baby diaper or a soft cloth which has been dampened with cool water. Wrap the cloth around the injured area. Place a plastic barrier over the cloth. Elevate the extremity and let it sit for 1/2-1 hour and do 3x/day. (This can also be done for people who have arthritis). These are just a few remedies which have been handed down to me or have been learned thru reading articles or books and by word of mouth from other sources over the years. These remedies are not clinically proven and there is no guarantee they will work. Any severe trauma, allergic reaction, symptoms or pain should be taken care of by a medical professional. These remedies are also intended to help mask symptoms only and are not cures for any of the above mentioned diseases.
