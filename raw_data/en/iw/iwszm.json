With the recent increase in lifespan, it is important to understand the 'what, why, who, where, when, and how' of aging to be well prepared and lead a healthy/productive life. This course will provide opportunities to learn about several aspects of biological aging at the theoretical, molecular, cellular, and whole -body level. There will be discussions on cutting -edge research and the latest discoveries to provide a contemporary and up-to-date knowledge base. Prerequisite It is desirable but not mandatory for students to have had an undergraduate course in biology. Course objectives By the conclusion of the course, students are expected to be able to: 1) Provide an informed opinion on key issues in biologic al gerontology relevant to health care providers, social service professionals, educators, administrators and policy analysts. 2) Discuss the nature of aging at the theoretical, molecular, cellular, and whole -body level. 3) Clearly distinguish between normal aging processes and age-associated diseases. 4) Understand/analyze the latest research on biogerontology and continue to stay updated.

Exams: There will be two take-home exams, a midterm given out on March 2 (due on March 9 ), and a final given on April 27 (due on May 11 ). There will be a single question on each lecture, of which 4 of the 7 should be answered in a short essay (one-page answer maximum per question). The exams are not cumulative . The format for all exams and the term paper is single - spaced, Arial 12pt, and 1\" margins. References and figures are NOT included in page counts. Term paper (25% of overall grade): There will be a 5-page term paper on a student - selected topic of relevance to this course. Please note that the subject matter and titles of all term papers must be approved in advance by the course instructor. All term papers are due on or before 5:00 pm on Wednesday, May 5 . Students will b e required to write a term paper that reviews a significant area of relevance to the course material. The subject matter and titles of all term papers must be approved in advance by the course instructor. All term papers must be submitted as .pdf files The term paper must represent students' own original work and provide an in -depth review of an aspect of the course. The paper will count for 25% of the final grade in this class. Students are free to choose their own topics, but all topics must be approved by the course coordinator. Students should not start serious work on a research paper until they have received approval from the course coordinator. Student papers must be a minimum of five (5) pages in length, plus references. The reference list is in addit ion to the 5 pages minimum for text. S ingle -spaced type should be used, with a 12 point Ariel font. Other formatting requirements include the following: a one -inch all - around margin, all pages numbered consecutively. Papers must have an appropriate title, and students must be sure to print their own names on their papers. Student papers must include at least twenty (20) literature references . Students are encouraged to use the internet the campus libraries to find appropriate background information and references. The references used should primarily be published journal articles from the bio - medical literature, rather than books. Unpublished opinions from the internet and popular magazines are not appropriate sources. Numbers should be used to quote referen ces directly in the text of term papers, like this for a single reference (1), and like this for multiple references to the same point (1, 2, 3) . A list of references must appear at the end of each paper with each reference numbered in the same order it appears in the text. Extensive direct quotations are not appropriate for this term paper, an d copying without giving credit is never acceptable. Any quote used should be no longer than three (3) lines long, and should be set inside quotation marks. The source for any quote must also be fully referenced in the reference list. Illustrations may be used but they must be each student's original work, and not simply reproduced from existing literature sources. Students may incorporate as many Illustrations as they wish into their papers, but illustrations do not count towards the minimum five (5) pages required for each paper. Footnotes should not be used.

All Term Papers will only be accepted as .pdf files Statement on Academic Conduct , Diversity & Inclusion, Emergency Preparedness , and Support Systems Students with Disabilities: (the information below was provided by the office of the Provost) Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP)each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure that the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located on campus in STU301 and is open from 8:30 am -5:00 pm Monday through Friday. The phone number for DSP is 213-740-0776 email: ability@usc.edu ; web address: http://sait.usc.edu/academicsupport/centerprograms/dsp/home_index.html Policies and Class Etiquette: Students are expected to be courteous to others and arrive to class, in person or on-line, on time. Students must turn off cellular phones and pagers during class as well as any other electronic device that may ring or otherwise disrupt class. Personal laptops may be used for note-taking but not for 'recreational' purposes during class time. Assignments turned in late for any reason will incur a deduction of 10% of the total point value for the assignment for each day past the due date. Completion of all course readings and assignments and active participation during class discussions is expected of all students. Statement on Academic Integrity: Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherw ise allowed by the instructor. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. SCampus, the Student Guidebook, contains the University Student Conduct Code (see University Governance, Section 11.00), while the recommended sanctions are located in Appendix A. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, \"Behavior Violating University standards\" https://policy.usc.edu/scampus -part-b/. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on scientific misconduct, http://policy.usc.edu/scientific - misconduct Statement of Diversity & Inclusion The USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology is committed to creating an inclusive classroom environment that values the diversity of all its members. The School is committed to providing a purposefully inclusive community where all members and visitors are free from all intolerant behavior (including but not limited to harassment, verbal or written abuse, threats, ridi cule, or intimidation). We encourage all members within our community to embrace and learn from the diversity within our classroom, school, and university.
