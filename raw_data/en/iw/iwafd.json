With a st u- dent enrollment exceeding 15,000 and faculty and staff num- bering more than 16,400, UAB has become a nationally and internationally respected center for educational, research, and service programs. Our campus e ncompasses a 75 -block area on Birmingham's Southside, offering all of the advantages of a university within a city. The university is composed of 12 schools, as well as ho s- pitals and clinics housing internationally renowned patient - care programs. UAB includes the Schools of Arts and H uman- ities, Business, Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Health R e- lated Professions, Medicine, Natural Sciences and Math emat- ics, Nursing, Optometry, Public Health, and Social and Beh a- vioral Sciences. The Graduate School administers Ph.D. and many other adva nced degree pr ograms in these areas. UAB attracted $325 million in active grants and contracts in fiscal year 2001, ranking it among the top instit utions in the country in this respect (19th in NIH sup port). For graduate students, this funding status means availability of financial support, access to well -equipped research laboratories, ad e- quate supplies, and interaction with faculty members who have earned research support based on the favorable judgment of their colleagues natio nwide. Accreditation The University of Alabama at Birmingham is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Associ ation of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the bachelor's, master's, specialist, and doctoral levels. Individual schools and programs are also accred ited by regional and national profe s- sional organizations. Student Life Campus life at UAB is characterized by the bustle and d i- versity of the university's urban setting. More than 3,700 UAB graduate students take advantage of a wide variety of cultural and recreational opportunities on and off campus, and nume r- ous student organizations and associations invite partic ipation. UAB's Hill University Center serves as a hub for campus life, providing under one roof a full -service cafeteria, a large book store, an auditorium, meeting rooms, lounges, and other recreational areas. The UAB Arena seats more than 8,000 for concerts, sports events, graduation exercises, and other sp ecial events. The Alys Robinson Stephens Performing Arts Center houses a 1,400- seat concer t hall and the 400 -seat Mo rris K. Sirote Theater. Both of these facilities have outstanding acou s- tics, technical capability, and comfort, and each hosts a wide variety of student and professional pe rformances. The Alys Stephens Center also has a 175 -seat r ecital hall, an experimen- tal (\"black box\") theater, an arts computing facility, practice rooms, faculty offices, and other instructional space. The cen- ter is home to the Alabama Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety of cultural events throug hout the year. Ten musical performing groups (Blazer Band, Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Gospel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, March- ing Blazers, Computer Music Ensemble, Opera Workshop, Percussion Ensemble, and Wind Ensemble) provide enric h- ment and performing opportunitie s. A major cam pus theater offers several productions each year (free to students); there are several small performing groups on campus, as well as a UAB -affiliated community theater. Dance groups offer oppo r- tunities in ballet and jazz. Artwork is continuou sly exhibited in the Visual Arts Gallery and several other galleries on ca m- pus. Student publications include a campus -wide newspaper, The Kaleidoscope , published weekly; a literary mag azine, Aura; and a nonfiction magazine, Phoenix . University programs inc lude a lecture series, an acclaimed film series (showing films several times a month, inclu ding popular, foreign, and classic films), a progre ssive and diverse concert series, and an assortment of special events, seminars, dances, and other activities. Man y of these programs and a c- tivities are free to st udents with valid ID cards. UAB's intercollegiate sports program includes baseball, football, rifle, softball, synchronized swimming, track, and volleyball, as well as men's and women's teams for basket- ball, golf, soccer, and tennis. Many of our teams have won conference champio nships. Recreational facilities on campus include a large well - equipped gym (free to students with valid IDs) with an indoor pool, full -length basketball courts, racque tball/handball c ourts, a squash court, a weight room, an indoor track, a gymnastics room, and a dance room. Adj acent to the gym are two softball fields, and two football fields with goals for soccer; a baseball field and a number of tennis courts are nearby. An active intramural sports program attracts the participation of many graduate st udents. UAB Study Abroad UAB Study Abroad offers opportunities for intern ational study either through UAB or non -UAB programs that are available to UAB students and others. All eligibilit y requir e- ments pertaining to credits and approval can be discussed with the Study Abroad Coordinator. The UAB pr ograms have been designed to take into consideration various academic disci p- lines and their complementary courses abroad and are offered in part nership with UAB academic departments. This coll a- borative effort facil itates, promotes, and strengthens intern a- tional education and unde rstanding. Study abroad options i n- clude work/study abroad, internships; direct enrollment, short- term, semester, and ful l-year exchanges; and opportunities in cross- cultural training, service, and international health r e- search. Application and en rollment circumstances and dead- lines vary according to the program. Contact the Study Abroad Coordi nator for further information c oncerning various pr o- grams, references for peer consultation and academic advising, and financial aid applicability and co ntacts.

Oak Ridge Associated U niversities Since 1971, students and faculty of the University of Al a- bama at Birmingham have benefited from its member ship in Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). ORAU is a co n- sortium of 85 colleges and universities and a contra ctor for the U.S. Depa rtment of Energy (DOE) located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORAU works with its member institutions to help their students and faculty gain access to federal research facil i- ties throughout the country; to keep its me mbers informed about opportunities for fello wship, scholarship, and research appointments; and to organize research alliances among its members. Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Educ a- tion (the DOE facility that ORAU operates), unde rgraduates, graduates, postgraduates, and faculty enjo y access to a mult i- tude of opportunities for study and research. A comprehensive listing of these programs and other opportunities, their disc ip- lines, and details on loc ations and benefits can be found in the ORISE Catalog of Education and Training Program s, which is available at www.orau.gov. Dauphin Island Sea Lab As a member of Alabama's Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium, UAB offers students and faculty a ccess to the courses and facilities of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, located in Mobile Bay on Alabama's Gulf Coast. For pr o- grams and co ntacts, visit their web site ( www.disl. org). Birmingham Birmingham is a dynamic, progressive urban center of great natural beauty. Almost a m illion people live in the me t- ropolitan area, which i ncludes parts of five counties in north - central Alabama. Because of its rapid growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Birmingham has an i nternational flavor and ethnic diversity that are unusual in the South. This diversity has been enhanced in the last three decades by the phenomenal growth of UAB. Health care and education have replaced other types of industry as Birmingham's economic base, and UAB is now the city's leading employer. Birmingha m's economy is fully dive r- sified, with rapid growth in service, financial, insu rance and real estate, wholesale trade, construction, and research fields. Construction is thriving in Birmingham, with rapid suburban growth and massive revitalization and reno vation of historic structures downtown. D espite the city's rapid growth, the American Chamber of Commerce rates the cost of living in Birmingham lower than in most metropol itan areas. In addition to UAB and the University of Alabama School of Medicine, edu cational opportunities in the area include six other universities and colleges, seven community/junior co l- leges, five degree- granting technical schools, three law schools, and other specialized schools. The Bi rmingham area has over 1,300 houses of worship, representing virtually all denominations. School systems cover 5 county and 13 major city public school systems and over 50 private and denomin a- tional schools. Medical services are provided by 11 full - service hospitals. Located in the Sun Belt, Birmingha m enjoys an average year-round temperature of 62\u00b0 F, experiences ap proximately 117 days with rainfall each year and, in an aver age year, gets 2.1 inches of snowfall. The first freeze is usually in Nove m- ber, with the last frost in March. Birmingham offers i ts residents and visitors many oppor- tunities for both excitement and relaxation. Ongoing events take place at more than 40 movie screens, 5 community thea- ters, and numerous concert venues, including Oak Mountain Amphitheatre and Five Points Music Hall. In addition, a host of nightclubs and restaurants feature live entertai nment. The Birmingham Museum of Art, with a permanent co l- lection of over 1,700 works, is the largest of the area's m u- seums. Red Mountain Museum, Birmingham B otanical Gar- dens, and faciliti es at Oak Mountain State Park serve as av e- nues into the wonders of natural history. For those with sp e- cialized interests, the city offers the McWane Center and I M- AX Dome Theatre, Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, the Jazz Hall of Fame, the Southern M useum of Flight, and many others. Much of Bi r- mingham's \"fame\" comes from the racial tension that charac- terized the city in the 1950s and 1960s. That tension has been extensively documented and is now available as an interactive walk -through history at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, located in the heart of the Birmingham Civil Right's District, which centers on the hi storic 16th Street Baptist Church. Special events include the Birmingham International Fe s- tival of the Arts, which salutes art and craft from a di fferent country each year; City Stages, a world -class musical festival held in the heart of downtown each May; and Doo Dah Day, a whimsical parade of pets that marches through the numerous parks on Highland Avenue. For people and families who are attracted to the outdoors, Alabama offers 24 state parks. Oak Mountain State Park, l o- cated in the Birmingham area, is the largest (9,940 acres). D o- zens of smaller city parks offer further opport unities for hi k- ing, biking, sw imming, rappelling, and other sports as well as quiet places for outdoor reading, studying, and pi cnicking. Visionland, Alabama's Theme Park, thrills visitors with roller coasters, water rides, and other amusements. The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail takes in the Oxmoor Valley Golf Club; this and other world- class courses make golf a popular pas time for residents and tourists alike. Less than one day's drive away, the mountains of mi ddle Tennessee and the renowned \"sugar beaches\" of the Gulf of Mexico showcase the natural beauty of the southeastern United States. Much of information in this section was drawn from the Birmingham Area Chamber of Commerce (www.birminghamchamber.com ). The Graduate School More t han 52 years have passed since the first Ph.D. d e- gree was earned on the Birmingham campus. Currently, the Grad uate School administers doctoral programs in 33 areas and master's level programs in 44 areas, with additional pr o- grams planned for future impleme ntation. A pa rticular strength of the school is its many programs that unite diffe rent disciplines and cross departmental and school lines. UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 5 Graduate Council The Graduate Council has developed policies and proce- dures to ensure that high standards for gradua te study are maintained at UAB. These policies and procedures, available at the Graduate School's web site, are the joint responsibility of the Graduate Council and the dean of the Grad uate School. The Graduate Council, through consultation with the dean, is responsible for developing academic requirements and describing these requirements through appropr iate policies. The dean, through consultation with the Graduate Council, is responsible for developing procedures that e ffectively enforce academic require ments and implement pol icies. The Graduate Council, through its Advisory Committee, annually reviews academic requirements, policies, procedures, and Graduate School activities and reco mmends appropriate changes. Changes in academic requirements and related pol i- cies require a majority vote of the Grad uate Council. Graduate Student Association UAB graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Association (GSA), which works closely with the Graduate School and other offices of the university admin is- tration in formulating policy and meeting student needs. All graduate students are automatically members of the GSA, and the GSA Senate is composed of st udent representatives from the various graduate programs. The GSA provides partial funding for grad uate student travel to academic meetings and for thesis and dissertation preparation. The organization c os- ponsors a variety of services and activities, including the Ho n- ors Convocation, Graduate Student Research Day, Grad uate Student Orie ntation, and the GSA Emergency Loan Fund. The GSA office is located in Room 440C of the Hill Unive rsity Center (telephone 205 -934-4717). Information on travel grants and interlibrary loans may be picked up in the Graduate School office, Room 511 of the Hill University Center (tel e- phone 205- 934-8227), or at the GSA web site (www.uab.edu/gsa ). Roundtable The UAB Industry Roundtable, sponsored by the UAB Graduate School, is a student -initiated and student -run info r- mal discussion gr oup open to all graduate students and dedi- cated to fostering a greater awareness of career opportun ities outside academia. Its goals are to provide a forum for networking with i n- dustry representatives; establish an interface between acad e- mia and industry; introduce students to the process of making industry contacts; encourage students to comment, ask que s- tions, and seek advice from nonacademics; stimulate st udents to begin career development early in their educational exp e- rience; and provide information t o students about alternative career opportunities. The web site (www.uab.edu/roundtable ) has more inform ation. Graduate Student Research Day Graduate Student Research Day is an annual competition in which grad uate students present their original r esearch in an open forum. Deadlines for Research Day are a nnounced in the fall semester and are available at the Graduate School's web site. Awards are presented at a luncheon ceremony each spring semester. Application and Admission The Graduate School welcomes applications from all qualified individuals who wish to pursue graduate study at UAB. Categories of Graduate Student Two broad categories of graduate students are reco gnized: degree- seeking graduate students and non -degree -seeking graduate students. Degree- Seeking Students Degree- seeking graduate students are those accepted into a specific graduate program to work toward a specific ad- vanced degree. In addition to the completed appl ication form, the application pr ocedure includes the submission of official transcripts, standardized test scores, and letters of recomme n- dation. Each application is reviewed by the graduate program faculty, who make an admissions recommendation to the Graduate School dean or a represen tative of the graduate dean. Non-Degree- Seeking Students The nondegree category serves students who do not wish to pursue a graduate degree at UAB, as well as those who wish to begin graduate study before being admitted to a degree pr o- gram. Not all graduate courses are open to non -degree -seeking graduate students. Although there is no limitation on the amount of credit that may be earned as a non -degree -seeking student, should a student later wish to pursue an advanced degree at UAB, the credit earned while in non -degree -seeking status is not automatically acceptable toward the degree. In no case can more than 12 semester hours earned as a nond e- gree graduate student be applied toward a de gree. Because of U.S. immigration requirements, international applicants (i.e., those who are neither U.S. citizens nor perm a- nent residents) cannot normally be considered for the nond e- gree category unless already residing in the United States. Immigration laws should be consulted to dete rmine eligibility of students. Complete Application Package The completed application package includes (1) the co m- pleted application form; (2) a check for the appropriate processing fee (stated on the form); (3) two copies of official transcripts1 from all colleges or universities attended (the a p- plicant must arrange for these to be sent directly to the Grad u- ate School Office); (4) official copies of the applicant's scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test2, (5) three evaluations, preferably on the Graduate School Eval- 1 Official tra nscripts are those issued by the registrar or r e- sponsible head of the institution at which the work was a t- tempted or completed and sent by mail directly to the Grad u- ate School by that official. In those rare instances in which international applicants are unable to provide official tra n- scripts, certain certified documents may be ac ceptable. 2 GRE scores must be sent directly from the testing agency to the Graduate School. (Some UAB graduate programs require, or are willing to accept, other recognized nation al tests. Sp e- cific program requirements are outlined in the online program descriptions.) Although ETS retains scores up to five years, some pr ograms will not accept scores more than two years old. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 6 uation F orm3; (6) (for i nternational applicants from non - English- speaking countries only) official copies of the appl i- cant's scores on the Test of En glish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the Test of Written English (TWE; see individ u- al program sections for minim um score requir ements). Application packages, in general, will not be considered until the package is complete. To allow time for the applic a- tion review process, all documents must be r eceived in the Graduate School office at least six weeks before the beg inning of the term in which the applicant wishes to begin the graduate program. Some graduate pr ograms admit only at certain times of the year and have specific application deadlines. These dead lines are indicated in the online program descriptions. Admiss ion Standards Admission is competitive and is based on an estimate of the ability of the applicant to complete the degree program successfully and on the appropriateness of the program to the applicant's career goals. The Graduate School and its programs accept the most qualified st udents who apply. Most programs can accommodate only a limited number of students; ther e- fore, some qualified applicants may be denied admission. Master's Degree Programs Although each graduate program sets its own minimum standar ds for admission, the Graduate School has established guidelines for admission to master's degree pr ograms. These guidelines are (1) a B average (computed overall, or altern a- tively computed over the last 60 semester hours of earned cr e- dit) in undergraduate work, (2) ev idence of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accred ited university or college in the Uni t- ed States, (3) a score of at least 500 on each section of the Graduate Record E xamination General Test (some programs require or accept other national tests), and (4) previous aca- demic work appropriate to the academic area to which applica- tion is b eing made. Doctoral Degree Programs Although each graduate program sets its own minimum standards for admission, the Graduate School has established guidelines for admission to doctoral degree pr ograms. These guidelines are (1) a B average (computed overall, or altern a- tively computed over the last 60 seme ster hours of earned cr e- dit) in undergraduate or subsequent graduate work, (2) evi-dence of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited un i- versity or co llege in the United States, (3) a score of at least 550 on each section of the Graduate Record Examination General Test (some programs require or accept other national tests), and (4) previous academic work ap propriate to the ac a- demic area to which application is being made. Note that some programs also require a master's degree before admission to the doctoral program. Because of guidelines set by external accreditation authorities, the requirements for applic ation and admission to certain graduate programs may di ffer from the above, particularly in the standard test required. These vari a- tions are detailed in the online program descri ptions. Admission on Probation Students not meeting all program admission criteria may be admitted on probation upon recommendation by the gradu- ate program director and approval by the Graduate School dean. 3 Evaluation forms are not required for the business pr ograms. Re-admission The records of in a year will be removed from the UAB computerized registration system. Such students must apply for re -admission before they may register again. Degree- seeking students who (1) have been absent one year but have registered for and passed at least one course at UAB within the last five years and (2) have not at tended any other university or college in the interim and (3) wish to return to the graduate program to which they were earlier admitted may complete the Application for Re -admission to a Graduate Degree Program and pay the required processing fee. These re- admitted st u- dents must meet the degree r equir ements operative at the time of re -admission. Students who wish to return to the nondegree category after an absence of one or more years must su bmit a new nondegree application form, together with the required proces sing fee. Admission of Students Pr eviously Di smissed When any individual applies to a graduate program, a m a- jor part of the admissions decision involves an est imate, based on the applicant's academic history, of whether the applicant can perform satisfactorily at the graduate level. To be re - admitted, applicants who have previously been dismissed from the Graduate School must present convincing evidence to the faculty and the Graduate School dean that a substantial i m- provement has occurred so that it is probable that the applicant can now p erform at the r equired level in graduate work. After a student has been dismissed from the UAB Grad u- ate School, no new application for admission (either as a d e- gree-seeking student or as a nondegree student) will be co nsi- dered until at least two semesters have passed. Faculty To maintain university accountability, UAB faculty and staff who wish to take occasional graduate courses must regi s- ter for these courses after admission to the Graduate School on the non- degree -seeking basis. Admission of a UAB facult y member as a degree -seeking grad uate student requires the concurrence of the applicant's department chair and dean(s), as well as the approvals required for other applicants to the same program. General Academic Requir ements Unless otherwise stated, the p olicies in this section apply to both degree -seeking and non -degree -seeking graduate st u- dents. Graduate Credit For purposes of academic accounting, credits expressed in \"semester hours\" are assigned to each course. The guid eline for lecture courses is that one semester hour of credit is awarded for 13- 15 contact hours. Laboratory credit is assigned on the basis of one semester hour of credit for approximately 30 hours of work in the labor atory. Requirements for Undergraduate Students UAB undergraduate stude nts may be allowed to enroll in a graduate course with the approval of their advisor, the i n- structor, their undergraduate program director, and the grad u- ate program director. The Undergraduate Student Request for Enrollment in Graduate Level Coursework for m can be o b- tained from the Graduate School, Room 511 Hill University Center, or online. Credits earned by undergraduate students UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 7 may be applied to either an undergraduate degree or a grad u- ate degree, but not both. If the student is subsequently admi t- ted to the Graduate School, use of this credit toward a grad u- ate degree requires the approval of the graduate program d i- rector and the Grad uate School dean. Course Numbering System The scholastic level of UAB courses is indicated by the century number. Courses n umbered 500 and above are grad u- ate and postbaccalaureate courses. Courses nu mbered 500- 599 are available to upper -level undergrad uate and beginning graduate students. Courses numbered 600 and above are for graduate students. Those numbered 600- 699 are inte nded pr i- marily for students at the master's level, with 698 r eserved for nonthesis research and 699 reserved for thesis research. Courses numbered 700- 799 are primarily for st udents at the doctoral level, except in the School of Education where the numbers from 700- 740 are reserved for courses leading to the degree of Educational Specialist (Ed.S.). The number 798 is reserved for nondissertation research and 799 for dissertation research. Seminars, practica, individual studies and pr ojects, internships, and residencies will generally carry numbers in the up per range of these centuries. Time Limitations Doctoral students are generally expected to complete all degree requirements with 7 years of matriculation. One exte n- sion of this time limit can be requested when mitigating ci r- cumstances preclude completion of requirements within 7 years. The recommendation for an extension should i nclude a plan and timeline for completion. Such requests require the approval of the student's dissertation commit tee and graduate program director and must be presented in writing to the dean of the Graduate School for consideration and approval. Courses taken more than 7 years before gradua tion may not be applied toward a degree without the approval of the graduate program d irector and graduate dean. Course Enrollment Registration Students must register for all work to be taken for grad u- ate credit. To be classified as \"full time,\" a graduate st udent must register for at least 9 semester hours of work each sem e- ster. The university publishes the UAB Class Schedule three times per year, approximately 2 weeks b efore the beginning of registration for the approac hing semester. The class schedule lists the courses and other work to be offered and gives full details on prerequisites, regi stration dates, and procedures, including required sign atures. Adding or Changing Courses Adding or changing courses after registration is possible each semester until the date specified in the UAB Class Sch e- dule. Procedures are also specified in that publ ication. A proces sing fee is charged for registration changes. Withdrawal from Courses Graduate students are expected to complete courses for which they have registered, unless unusual circumstances r e- quire withdrawal. The procedures for wit hdrawal are specif ied in the UAB Class Schedule. Mere cessation of class atten-dance does not constitute withdrawal, either aca demically or for tuition charges. Withdrawal from a graduate class requires permission of the instructor and the graduate program director. A grade of W will be entered on the transcript. With drawal is not possible after the last day of classes. A processing fee is charged for registr ation changes. Credit by Examination Students may not earn \"credit by examination\" at the graduate level. Audits Gradua te students may audit courses available for grad u- ate credit with the permission of the instructor and payment of appropriate fees; this approval must be secured before regi s- tration. Courses taken for audit credit are not counted toward the hours required f or full -time status. Provided the instru c- tor's requirements are met, the course will appear on the tran- script with the not ation AU. Course Completion Grading System The grade of A is used to indicate superior performance, B for adequate performance, and C for performance only min i- mally adequate for a graduate student. Any graduate student completing a course at the 500 level or above with a perfo r- mance below the C level will r eceive a grade of F , because the Graduate School does not use the grade of D . Grad es in Pass/Not Pass Courses With the approval of the graduate program director, a course may be designated as a \"pass/not pass course.\" The grade of P (passing) signifies satisfactory work. The grade of NP (not passing) indicates unsatisfactory work, witho ut a p e- nalty being assessed with respect to the grade point a verage (GPA). Temporary Grade Notations Temporary notations used by the Graduate School are N for \"no grade reported,\" and I for \"incomplete\" cours ework. If there is a special circumstance in whi ch an instructor does not submit a grade at the end of a semester, a temp orary grade of N will be recorded. If no permanent grade has been reported by the end of the following semester, an F will aut o- matically be entered in the student's aca demic record. The temporary notation of I may be reported at the discr e- tion of the instructor to indicate that the student has performed satisfactorily in the course but, due to unforeseen circu ms- tances, has been unable to finish all course requirements. An I is never gi ven to enable a student to raise a d eficient grade. This notation should not be used unless there is reasonable certainty that the requirements will be co mpleted during the following semester, because at the end of that semester the I automatically changes to an F . In highly unusual circu ms- tances, the student may request an extension of the time to complete the requirements. This request must be submitted in writing in a dvance of the time when the grade automatically changes to an F because the approval of the instructor, grad u- ate program director, and Graduate School dean are all r e- quired. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 8 Cumulative Credits and Grade Point Ave rage (GPA) Semester Hours Earned The student's \"semester hours earned\" are increased by (1) earning a grade of C or better in a cour se for which the student was registered on a regular (\"letter grade\") basis or (2) obtaining a P grade in a course taken on a pass/not pass b asis. Semester Hours Attempted The student's \"semester hours attempted\" are increased by receiving a grade of A, B, C, or F in a course for which the student was registered on a regular basis. Quality Points Four quality points are awarded for each semester hour in which an A is earned, three quality points are awarded for each semester hour in which a B is earned, and two qua lity points are awarded for each semester hour in which a C is earned. No quality points are added for other grades. GPA The GPA is determined by dividing the t otal quality points awarded by the semester hours a ttempted. Repeated Courses Graduate s tudents may be allowed to repeat courses for graduate credit with the permission of the graduate adv isor and graduate program director. All courses taken and all grades earned are permanently recorded on the student's tran-script. The first time a student r epeats a course, he or she r ece- ives the grade earned. If a course if taken three or more times, all grades after the first are averaged. The Graduate School Records Office must be notified of the repeat at the time of registration. (The calc ulation using t he repeat grade is not au- tomatic.) Note: Many graduate programs also base r etention decisions on progra mmatic guidelines and not on GPA. Academic Performance Good Academic Standing For a student to maintain good academic standing in the Graduate School, a GPA of at least 3.0 ( B average) and overall satisfactory performance on pass/not pass courses are r e- quired. Satisfactory perfor mance on pass/not pass courses is defined as earning at least as many hours of P grades as hours of NP grades. Academic Probation and Dismissal Students who are admitted on probation must demon strate their ability to perform at the level required for graduation by establishing good academic standing at the end of the semester when their graduate semester hours attempted equals or fi rst exceeds 12. Students who do not accomplish this level of per- formance will be dismissed from the UAB Grad uate School. A degree -seeking or non- degree- seeking graduate student who has been in good academic standing but who, at the end of any semester, fai ls to meet the criteria to continue in good academic standing will be placed on probation. Such a st udent must re -establish good academic standing within the next two semesters of graduate study undertaken. Students who do not accomplish this level of perf ormance will be di smissed from the UAB Graduate School. The rules stated above govern university probation and dismissal, administered by the Graduate School. Indivi dual graduate programs may establish and administer program pr o- bation and dismissal governe d by more stri ngent requirements. In general, a student's retention in a specific graduate program is contingent on the faculty's belief that the student is likely to complete the program successfully. If the faculty ceases to hold this belief, the student may be dismissed from the pr o- gram. UAB Student Record Policy Federal law guarantees students certain rights with respect to their educational records. It is the student's responsibil ity to become familiar with the university's stated policies on these rights (i.e., Appendix II: UAB Student Records Policy ). Conduct and Appeal Academic Conduct The University of Alabama at Birmingham expects all members of its academic community to function accor ding to the highest ethical and profes sional standards. Students, fa cul- ty, and administration of the institution must be involved to insure this quality of ac ademic conduct. Academic misconduct undermines the purpose of educ a- tion. Such behavior is a serious violation of the trust that must exist among faculty and students for a unive rsity to nurture intellectual growth and development. Academic misconduct can generally be defined as all acts of dishonesty in an ac a- demic or related matter. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, th e following categ ories of behavior: ABETTING: helping another student commit an act of academic dishonesty. Allowing others to copy your quiz answers, or use your work as their own are examples of abetting. CHEATING: use or attempted use of unauthorized mate- rials, information, study aids, the answers of others, or computer -related inform ation. PLAGIARISM: claiming as your own the ideas, words, data, computer programs, creative compositions, ar twork, etc., done by someone else. Examples include improper citation of referenced works, use of commercially avai la- ble scholarly papers, failure to cite sources, cop ying ot h- er's ideas. FABRICATION: presenting as genuine falsified data, ci-tations, or quotations. MISREPRESENTATION: falsification, alteration or misstatement of the contents of documents, ac ademic work or other materials related to academic matters, i n- cluding re presenting work substantially done for one class as work done for another without receiving prior approval from the instructor. Misrepresentati on also includes m i- srepr esenting schedules, prerequisites, transcripts, or other academic r ecords. A student who commits an act of academic misconduct will be given the grade of F in the course in which the mi s- conduct occurred. The program in which the st udent is housed may expel the student from the university on the first offense. Students should consult the policies of their graduate program to determine if expulsion can occur with a first offense. If, as determined by the records of the Graduate School , the act of UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 9 academic misconduct is a sec ond offense, the student will be expelled from the university. The transcript of a student ex- pelled for committing academic misconduct will bear the statement \"Expelled for Academic Mi sconduct.\" When an instructor sees cause to charge a student with academic misconduct, the instructor will commun icate the charge to the department chair/program director ap propriate to the course, who will notify the student of the charge and pr o- vide the student with an opportunity to respond. If, at that time, the student cannot refute the charge effectively, the d e- partment chair/program director will exped itiously notify the student and the director of the student's program in writing, of the administrative action to be taken. The no tice shall also inform the student of the right to appeal and the steps involved in that process. Copies of the letter with appropriate docume n- tation will be sent to the graduate dean, who will maintain records of all proceedings. If the department chair/p rogram director is the instructor who charges the student with ac adem- ic misconduct, then another faculty member from the d epart- ment or program, appointed by the graduate dean will r eview the charge and take ap propriate actions. If the charge is not resolved to the student's or faculty member's satisfaction within a school, either party may r e- quest an appeal by the Graduate School Appeals Board . The decision of the Graduate Appeals Board is final. Academic misconduct that involves po ssible criminal a c- tion will be referred to other appropriate offices within the institution. Students and faculty should also consult the uni- versity's policy on scientific misconduct for discussion of standards and policies that apply to research and r esearch courses. Nonacademic Conduct The university is a community of scholars and learners; therefore, all participants are expected to maintain co nduct that (1) facilitates the institution's pursuit of its educational objectives, (2) exhibits a regard for th e rights of other me m- bers of the academic community, and (3) provides safety for property and persons. Through appropriate \"due process\" pr o- cedures, disciplinary action will be taken in response to co n- duct that violates these princ iples. A more detailed de scription of nonacademic misconduct can be found in the student hand-book, Direction . It is the student's responsibility to be fully aware of the policies and procedures d escribed in Direction . The vice president for student affairs has the responsibility f or coordinating policies and procedures regarding students' non- academic mi sconduct. Graduate School Deadlines All Graduate School deadlines, as indicated on the cale n- dar or in explanation of policies and procedures, unless othe r- wise stated, are final by 5: 00 p.m. on the date specified, by which time all transactions must be completed and documents received in the Graduate School. Transac tions and documents requiring the action or approval of graduate advisors, commi t- tee members, instructors, department chai rmen, academic deans, or others prior to receipt by the Graduate School should be initiated by the appropriate person (student, instructor, graduate advisor, or other) sufficiently in advance of the Graduate School deadline for the required actions to be t aken and approv als made or declined before the deadline. Requirements for the Master's D egree Faculty Advisor Immediately after a degree- seeking student enters the UAB Graduate School, a member of the faculty of the grad u- ate pr ogram to which the student ha s been admitted should be assigned to serve as the student's advisor. The assignment may be a temporary arrangement. The student and the advisor should confer about courses and any special work to be taken on the basis of the student's previous experience and the r e- quirements of the graduate pr ogram. Graduate Study Committee As soon as possible, a specific plan of study should be deve loped. Traditionally, graduate study is highly flexible and individualized, and a graduate study committee is appointed, chaired by the student's advisor, to guide the student toward the degree. (Some graduate pr ograms do not always use a graduate study committee, particu larly where flexibility in the course of study is limited by accreditation and other ex ternal constraints.) T he committee should consist of at least three Graduate School faculty members, one of whom should be from outside the student's grad uate specialization and each of whom should be able to bring some relevant insight and e x- pertise to guide the st udent. Reco mmendations for graduate study committee membe r- ship are submitted by the advisor and the student to the grad u- ate program director. The graduate program d irector submits these recommendations to the Graduate School dean, who is an ex officio member of all g raduate study commi ttees, for approval. Plan I or Plan II The Graduate School recognizes two principal paths, known as Plan I and Plan II, that lead to the master's d egree. One or the other of these plans may be appropriate in partic u- lar circumstances, and in some programs a choice is available. The graduate study committee conducts the final thesis ex-amination for Plan I candidates and determines the scope, co n- tent, and form of the final master's comprehensive examin a- tion for thesis -substitute and Plan II candidates. Plan I requires the completion, in good academic stan d- ing, of at least 24 semester hours of appropriate grad uate work and 6 semester hours of thesis research, with the presentation of an acceptable thesis embodying the results of original r e- search work. Plan II may not require research and does not require a formal thesis, but a minimum of 30 semester hours of appr o- priate graduate work must be completed in good academic standing. Although thesis research is not r equired as part of a Plan II cour se of study, the student is often expected to gain insight into the techniques of posing and solving problems and to use these insights to prepare a written r eport. Where both Plan I and Plan II are available within one graduate program, an early and meani ngful choice should be made by the student, in close consultation with the advisor. A change in choice of plans requires the approval of the pr ogram director and the Graduate School dean. Transfer of Credit Previously earned graduate credit that has not been a p- plied toward another degree (either at UAB or els ewhere) is -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 10 eligible for transfer into the student's current d egree program. (Ordinarily, no more than 12 semester hours of transfer credit can be applied to a degree pr ogram.) All transfers must be initiated by the student and require the approval of the grad u- ate program director and the Graduate School dean. Transfer of Credit Forms are available in the Graduate School, Room 511 Hill Unive rsity Center, and online. An application for transfer of credit w ill not be considered until the student has completed at least 9 semester hours of graduate credit in the current UAB program and is in good academic standing. Once transfer credit has been accepted, it will be included in the calculation of the GPA in the student's current UAB pr ogram. Graduate credit earned with a grade of B or above by a graduate student in another accredited graduate school may be consi dered for transfer. In programs offered jointly by UAB and other universities, all graduate credits earned in the pr o- gram at a cooperating university are el igible for transfer to UAB. If a student earns credit in one UAB graduate program and is later admitted to another pr ogram, unused credits from the previous program are eligible for consideration for tr ansfer into the current pr ogram. Additional Program Requirements In consultation with the faculty, the director of each gra d- uate program will specify any additional requir ements, such as a reading knowledge of a foreign language or a wor king knowledge of s tatistics, that are considered essential to ma s- tery of the academic discipline. Such requirements b ecome conditions for the completion of the degree. The pr ogram may also adopt a system of examinations that the student must pass at var ious points in the pr ogram. Candidacy for Degree Admission to candidacy is a formal step recommended by the student's graduate study committee and ap proved by the graduate program director and the Graduate School dean, ac- knowledging that the student has been performing well and is likely to complete the degree. For Plan I st udents, admission should occur when the student has obtained an adequate back- ground (although not all coursework need be complete) and has provided the committee with an accep table proposal for thesis resear ch. Students must be in good academic standing to be eligible for admission to candidacy, and admission must take place no later than one semester before the ex pected graduation. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they can register for thesis re search hours (i.e., courses nu m- bered 699). Application for Degree Each candidate for a master's degree must signify the i n- tention to complete the requirements by a particular gradu a- tion date by submitting a completed Application for Degree Form. Because th is form is used to check completion of r e- quirements, order the diploma, and enter the student in the commencement program, the form must be received in the Graduate School Records Office no later than 3 weeks into the semester of expected gradu ation. See d eadline dates (later in this booklet). Students must be registered for at least 3 sem e- ster hours of graduate work in the semester they plan to grad u- ate. Thesis The thesis required under Plan I should present the results of the candidate's original research and the inte rpretation of those results. The document should also demonstrate the ca n- didate's acquaintance with the literature of the field and with the proper selection and execution of research metho dology. The physical form of the thesis must comply wi th the regul a- tions stated in the booklet Theses and Dissertations: A Guide to Preparation, which is pu blished by the Graduate School and is available online. Within 10 days after the public defense, students should meet with Graduate School staff to review style and format requirements. The Graduate School has the r esponsibility for ensuring that the final version of the thesis meets the standards required of a permanent, published doc ument. Thus, after the student successfully passes the final e xamination (and at least 20 days before the expected graduation), the candidate must submit to the Graduate School one error -free, unbound copy of the thesis that meets the minimum acceptance requirements of the Graduate School. This copy will be examined carefully, and the Graduate School r eserves the right to require changes to bring the document up to the standards of the chosen style guide and those stated in Theses and Dissert ations: A Guide to Preparation. After making these final changes, the candidate must sub mit to the Graduate School two typed (or otherwise reproduced) copies of the thesis on white, 25% cotton, acid-free, watermarked p aper. These copies must be received no later than 10 days after the return of the unbound thesis copy to the student. The Grad uate School will have the two bound copies of the final version of the thesis placed in the appropr i- ate UAB library. Students should attend the free seminar titled \"Staying Afloat While Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation,\" which is offered each semester by the Graduate School Pr ofessional Development Program. Additional assistance is available for students registered in GRD 704 (offered every semester by the Professional Development Pr ogram). Final Examination Under Plan I, the final examination should take the form of a presentation and defense of the thesis, followed by an examination of the candidate's compr ehensive knowledge of the field. Plan I examinations must be scheduled through the Graduate School. The meeting must be appropriately a n- nounced in the UAB Reporter, must be open to all interested parties, and must take place at least 30 days before the e x- pected date of graduation. Plan I candidates must be regi stered for at least 3 semester hours of graduate work in the semester during which degree requirements are co mpleted. When Plan II is followed, the final examination should take the form of a comprehensive survey of the candidate's activities in the graduate program. (A Plan II final examina- tion is not used in some graduate pr ograms.) Recommendatio n for Degree The candidate will be recommended for the master's d e- gree to the Graduate School dean by the graduate study co m- mittee or by the student's advisor and the graduate program director. This recommendation must be received no later than 20 days bef ore the end of the semester in which the candidate is expected to complete all degree requirements. The reco m- mendation will be based on evalu ation of all work performed, UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 11 the final examination, and the thesis if Plan I was followed. The recommendation will automatically be nullified if (1) the remaining courses needed for the degree are not passed, (2) the candidate fails to maintain good aca demic standing, (3) the candidate fails to remove all temporary grades from the tran- script, or (4) the Plan I cand idate fails to complete the thesis. Award of Degree Upon approval by the Graduate School dean and payment of any outstanding financial obligations to the university, the student will be awarded the degree. Master's students are gen- erally expected to complete all degree requirements with 7 years of matriculation.

Requirements for the Doctoral D egree General Statement The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of (1) sch o- larly proficiency and (2) distinctive achievement in a specific field of an academic discipline. The first component is demo n- strate d by successful completion of advanced coursework (of both a didactic and an unstructured nature) and by ad equate performance on the comprehensive examination. Traditio nal- ly, the student demonstrates the second component by ind e- pendently performing origina l research. In certain doctoral programs, a major pr oject undertaking may be acceptable even though it may not be of a traditional research nature. However, in all in stances a dissertation is required, presenting the results of the st udent's independent st udy. Faculty Advisor Immediately after a degree- seeking student enters the UAB Graduate School, a member of the faculty of the grad u- ate pr ogram to which the student has been admitted should be assigned to serve as the student's advisor. This assignment may be a temporary arrangement. The student and the adv isor should confer about the initial courses and any special work to be taken on the basis of the student's previous e xperience and the requirements of the graduate program. Graduate Study Committee As so on as possible, a graduate study committee should be formed to guide the student in a program of courses, sem i- nars, and independent study designed to meet the student's needs and to satisfy program and Graduate School requir e- ments. This committee should co nsist of at least five grad uate faculty members, two of whom should be from outside the student's graduate specialization and each of whom should be able to bring some relevant insight and expertise to guide the student. Recommend ations for graduate study committee members are submitted by the advisor and the student to the program director, who subsequently submits these recomme n- dations to the Graduate School dean. Graduate study commi t- tee appointments are made by the Grad uate School dean, who is an ex off icio member of all graduate study committees. Registration Requirements Because the doctoral degree is earned on the basis of s a- tisfactory completion of the comprehensive examination and the dissertation, the Graduate School does not specify any minimum nu mber of courses or semester hours that must be completed for awarding of the degree. Courses taken at other institutions and in other degree programs may be used to sa tis- fy program requirements upon approval of the gradu ate study committee and the graduate program director. Doctoral st u- dents are expected to be registered for credit hours each s eme- ster. Residence Requirement The usual minimal period in which the doctoral degree can be earned is 3 academic years of full -time study, or longer if the student ha s periods of part -time enrol lment. The nature of doctoral study requires the closest contact between the st u- dent and the faculty of the graduate program, and the indivi d- ual investigation or other special work leading to the dissert a- tion must be done direct ly under the guidance and supervision of a regular member of the UAB graduate faculty. Therefore, doctoral st udents must be involved full time in doctoral study for at least one academic year (two semes ters). Foreign Language or Other Special Tools of R esearch In consultation with the faculty, the director of each gra d- uate program will specify any additional requir ements, such as a reading knowledge of a foreign language or a wor king knowledge of statistics, that are considered essential to mas- tery of the academic discipline. Such requirements b ecome conditions for the completion of the d egree. Comprehensive Examination The scholarly proficiency of a doctoral student in the cho- sen field of study must be evaluated by comprehensive exam i- nation. The conduct of these examinations is the responsibility of the graduate program in which the student is enrolled and may consist of either individual examinations in several a p- propriate areas or a single co mbined examination. When both written and oral examin ations are g iven, the written should -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 12 precede the oral so that there is an opportunity for the student to clarify any misunde rstanding of the written questions. Students must be registered for at least 3 semester hours of graduate work during the semester in which the comprehen- sive examina tion is taken. Admission to Candidacy When the student has passed the comprehensive examina- tion, satisfied any program requirements for foreign language proficiency or special tools of research, and presented to the graduate study com mittee an acceptable proposal for research or special study, the committee will recommend to the Grad u- ate School dean that the st udent be admitted to candidacy. A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy. Admission to candidacy must take place at least two semesters before the expected completion of the doctoral program. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they can register for dissertation r esearch hours (i.e., 799). Admission to candidacy is an important step forward in the student's pursuit of the doctorate. By this step, the grad u- ate committee indicates its confidence that the student is cap a- ble of completing the proposed research project and the do c- toral pr ogram. Application for Degree Each candidate for a doctoral degree must signify the i n- tention to complete the requirements by a particular gradu a- tion date by submitting a completed Application for Degree Form. Because this form is used to check requirements, order the diploma, and enter the student on the commence ment pr o- gram, it must be received in the Graduate School Records O f- fice no later than 3 weeks into the expected semester of grad u- ation. Dissertation The results of the candidate's individual inquiry must be presented in a written dissertation comprising a genuine co n- tribution to knowledge in the particular ac ademic field. The document should also demonstrate the candidate's acquai n- tance with the literature of the field and the proper selection and execution of research met hodology. The physical form of the dissertation must comply with the regulations stated in the booklet Theses and Dissert ations: A Guide to Preparation, which is published by the Graduate School and avai lable o n- line. Within 10 days after the public defense, students should meet with Graduat e School staff to review style and format requirements. The Graduate School has the r esponsibility for ensuring that the final version of the dissertation meets the standards required of a permanent published doc ument. Thus, after the student successfully passes the final examination (and at least 20 days before the ex pected graduation), the candidate must submit to the Graduate School one error -free, unbound copy of the dissertation. This copy will be examined carefully, and the Graduate School reserves th e right to r equire changes to bring the document up to the standards of the chosen style guide and those stated in Theses and Dissertations: A Guide to Preparation. After making these final changes, the candidate must submit to the Grad uate School two type d (or otherwise reproduced) copies of the dissertation on white, 25% cotton, acid-free, water marked paper. These copies must be received no later than 10 days after the return of the finalized unbound dissertation copy to the student. The microfilm and co pyright contract form and the Sur- vey of Earned Doctorates form must also be submi tted. All of these materials must be received no later than 10 days after the return of the finalized unbound dissertation copy to the st u- dent. The Graduate School will have t he two bound cop ies of the final version of the dissertation placed in the ap propriate UAB library. Students should attend the free seminar titled \"Staying Afloat While Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation,\" which is offered each semester by the Graduate Sch ool Pr ofessional Development Program. Additional assistance is available for students registered in GRD 704 (offered every semester by the Graduate School Professional Development Pr ogram). Final Examination The final examination should take the form of a present a- tion and defense of the dissertation, followed by an examin a- tion of the candidate's comprehensive know ledge of the field. This examination must be scheduled through the Graduate School to allow attendance of the dean. The meeting must be open to al l interested parties, publicized on the UAB campus, published in the UAB Reporter, and must take place at least 30 days before the expected date of gradu ation. Candidates must be regi stered for at least 3 semester hours of graduate work during the semester in which the final examina tion is taken. Recommendation for Degree The candidate will be recommended for the doctoral d e- gree to the Graduate School dean by the graduate study co m- mittee and the graduate program director. This recommend a- tion must be receive d no later than 20 days before the end of the semester in which the candidate is e xpected to complete all degree requirements. Candidates must be in a good academic standing to graduate, with no temporary grades for courses required for the degree on their transcripts. Award of Degree Upon approval by the Graduate School dean and payment of any outstanding financial obligations to the university, the student will be awarded the degree. Doctoral students are gen- erally expected to complete all degree requirem ents with 7 years of matriculation.

Student Housing and Residential Life Student Housing facilities include a traditional res idence hall, apartment -style residence halls, suite -style residence halls, and townhouse apartments for families. St udent Housing is centrally located on campus and is within walking distance of all classroom buildings, libra ries, and the Medical Center. Student Housing is limited to students who are admitted to UAB and who are in good standing. \"Good Stan ding\" means not on academic or disciplinary suspension. As an add i- tional eligibility requirement, a student must be enrolled for eight credit hours as an undergraduate or five credit hours as a graduate each term. The summer term is treated under a sep a- rate contract. The student will be required to satisfy these el i--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 14 gibility standards throughout the term of their Student Hous- ing Contract and to inform the Department of Student Housing and Residential Life of any changes in his/her status, which may affect his/ her eligibility. Residence Life Coordinators and Resident Assistants (RAs) serve the residence halls. The Residential Life Pr ogram consists of recreational, educational, and social events based on the needs and interests of the residents. In addition to pl an- ning this program, trained staff members are available to an- swer questions or help residents with personal or academic problems. Junior, senior, graduate, and professional students are el i- gible for single -occupancy apartments. Freshmen and soph o- mores mus t share an apartment with a roommate. Except for married students, only roo mmates of the same gender are permitted. Roommate requests must be mutual in order to be considered, and applications should be mailed at approx imate- ly the same time. Although every effort will be made to place applicants with the roommate of their choice, the D epartment of Student Housing and Residential Life cannot guarantee roommate requests and reserves the right to assign an appl i- cant to any avai lable space. Current rental rates are available from the Department of Student Housing and Residential Life. Rates in clude utilities and cable television in all residence halls. Only water and ca- ble television are furnished in the Garden Apartments. Tel e- phone service is avai lable through UAB Communications. Since housing at UAB is limited, students should a pply as early as possible, particularly if on -campus housing is desired for the fall semester. Application should be made to the D e- partment of Student Housing and Residential Life, 1604 9th Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294 -1230. Telephone 205-934-2092. Upon receipt of a completed Student Housing and Residential Life Application, a Student Housing Agre e- ment, and a $170 deposit ($20 of which is a nonrefundable application fee), a room wi ll be r eserved. Student Health and Insurance Pr ograms Student Health Service A Student Health Service, currently supported by student fees at the semester rate of $75 (subject to change) per ind i- vidual, is mandatory for all graduate students registered for 9 or more hours per semester. (See Health Forms, Waivers, and Insur ance Information, below.) Participation is required for all international students and for all students in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Optometry, and Health Related Professions. To participate in the Student Health Service, students must have an acceptable hospitalization insurance program (see Hospital and Major Medical Insurance Programs, below ). Students in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Optometry, and He alth Related Professions who are ta king fewer than 9 hours per semester may participate in the Student Health Service and the hospital and major medical insurance programs described below. The Student Health Ser vice is available to all graduate students with a completed health Hi s- tory and Physical Form and proof of hospital insu rance. Because preventive medicine is emphasized by the St u- dent Health Service, information on medical matters of inter-est to students is offered. The service maintains a professional relationship with the student, and strictest confidentiality is maintained. Students in need of counseling se rvices should contact the Counseling and Wellness Center (205 -934-5816). Hospital and Major Medical Insu rance Programs Hospitalization and major medical insurance coverage is available at attractive rates to students enrolled in the St udent Health Service. Spouses and children of eligible graduate st u- dents may also obtain coverage under this policy at a propor-tionate in crease in premium. Students w ho are already covered by hospitalization i n- surance that offers coverage equivalent to that in the UAB student hospitalization policy may sign a waiver to this effect and not be required to take the UAB policy. Failure to sign and file a waiver with the St udent Health Service will r esult in automatic coverage with Student Health Service insurance, and the st udent will be billed. Health Forms, Waivers, and Insurance Inform ation. All full -time degree -seeking graduate students are r e- quired to enroll in the S tudent Health Service (or sign a waiver with the Graduate School) and obtain major medical insurance coverage or to sign a waiver showing proof of insu rance. For all students who will be participating in the Student Health Service, the following health for ms must be co mpleted: (1) application for student insurance or waiver of insurance plan; and (2) medical history in which the st udent fills out pages 1, 2, and 4 and your physician fills out page 3. The completed form must be sent to Student Health Ser vice. For students in schools other than the Schools of Med i- cine, Dentistry, Nursing, Optometry, and Health Related Pr o- fessions who choose not to participate, the Waiver of Student Health Service and the Health Insurance must be completed and returned to the Graduate School office before the st udent registers for courses. THESE FORMS MUST BE IN THE APPROPRIATE OFFICE BEFORE THE STUDENT CAN REGISTER FOR CLASSES, NO LATER THAN THE FIRST WEEK OF CLASSES. The Certificate of Immunization Form must be co mpleted by all students and returned to the Graduate School office.

Financial Information UAB Payment Policies Most universities require payment of tuition and fees at registration. UAB gives you this option but also offers altern a- tives. Internal Payment Options Payments can be made directly to UAB by cash, check, or credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, and Discover). Pa yment by mail should be directed to UAB Student A ccounting Services; P.O. Box 1946; Birmingham, Alabama 35201- 1946. Payments may be made in person in the Hill University Ce nter, 1400 University Bou levard, in Room 322; in the student payment drop box located on the first floor of Hill University Center; or by credit card through A CCESS at 205 -930-0087, 5- 9600 (on campus) or toll -free at 1 -888-988-2567. External Payment Option UAB has arranged for our students to be eligible to use the financial planning experience and designated payment options offered through Academic Management Se rvices (AMS). Each student can make prearranged plans with AMS to meet the published due dates for fall and spring semest ers. The plans are based on 8 or 10 monthly advance payment schedules and provide an excellent way for students to estab- lish a monthly budget for educational costs. For more inform a- tion concerning the available plans, call an AMS education payment counselo r at 800- 635-0120 or browse their web site (www.amsweb.com ). Statement of Fees A statement of fees is provided to each student at registr a- tion. Charges shown on that statement are based on the st u- dent's status and courses as of the date of registr ation. School, classification, or course changes made after registr ation may result in additional charges. Credit for financial aid, external payment plans, UAB Educational Assistance benefits, or pa y- ments to be billed to a th ird-party vendor may not be r eflected on the Statement of Fees printed at registration. However, even if you do not receive a statement, you are still respons i- ble for payment by the deadlines. For information or clarifica- tion concerning the amount due, ple ase call Student Accoun t- ing Se rvices at 205 -934-3570 or 1- 888-255-8734. Delinquency Policy If any student has an unpaid financial obligation to UAB, all grades will be withheld and no transcripts will be issued for that student. Such a student will not be pe rmitted to register at UAB again and all services will be withheld until the oblig a- tion is paid in full, at which time withheld grades will be rei ns- tated. A debt to UAB is, of course, legally enforceable. To be fair to the overwhelming majority of studen ts who honor their commitment, UAB's po licy is to pursue unpaid student debts vigorously by all legal means. (See the current class schedule for published deli nquent fees.) \u2014www.students.uab.edu Tuition Adjustment Policies If you withdraw from a course (usi ng the appropriate pr o- cedures) prior to the close of business on the published date for Last Day to Drop Without Paying Tu ition and Fees, you will owe no tuition for that course. However, if you are still registered for a course at the close of business on the Last Day to Drop Without Paying Tuition and Fees, you must pay full tuition and fees for that course, even if you withdraw later. No refunds can be made unless a l icensed physician certifies that a condition, which arose after the last day to withdraw , was of sufficient duration and severity to make it impossible for you to continue in the course. Students suspended for disciplinary reasons are not eligible for r efunds or cancellation of charges due. Withdrawals and Refunds Students who wish to withdr aw from courses for which they are registered must use the official procedures specified in the UAB Class Schedule, published qua rterly. Mere failure to attend class does not constitute a drop or withdrawal. If the withdrawal form is received after the \"Last Day to Withdraw Without Pa ying Full Tuition and Fees\" (sp e--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 16 cified for each term in the UAB Class Schedule), full tu ition and fees will be due for the courses from which the st udent withdraws. Academic Common Market The Academic Common Market is an inters tate agree- ment among selected southern states for sharing aca demic programs at both the baccalaureate and graduate levels. Par tic- ipating states are able to make arrangements for their res idents who qualify for admission to enroll in specific programs in other states on an in -state tuition b asis. Participating states are Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louis iana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Ten nessee, Texas, Vi rginia, and West Virginia. If you are not an Alabama resident and you wish to enroll at UAB as an Academic Common Market st udent, you must be accepted for admission into a UAB program to which your state has obtained access for its residents through the Aca dem- ic Common Market coo rdinator in your home state. Certifica tion of eligibility must be received by the Grad u- ate School before the first day of class in the initial seme ster of registration to obtain in -state tuition status for the entire program; otherwise, in -state tuition status will be awarded beginning with the semester following receipt of this certifica- tion. To obtain the name and address of a state coordinator, contact the Graduate School, Room 511, Hill University Ce n- ter, 1400 University Boulevard, Birmingham, Alabama 35294- 1150 (telephone 205- 934-8227) or visit the Academic Co m- mon Market web site (www.cep.unt.edu/ACM.html ). Financial Aid Assistantships and Fellowships The Graduate School realizes that pursuit of an advanced degree may involve financial strai n. In many programs, grad u- ate student awards are available in limited number in the form of assistantships (service required) or fellowships (no service required.) Applications for assistantships or fellowships should be submitted to the director of the gr aduate program in which the student is, or plans to be, enrolled. Applic ations for minority fellowships are available in the Graduate School Office. The Graduate School also assists students in preparation of appl i- cations for extramural fello wships. The university's Financial Aid Office administers trad i- tional loan, grant, and work -study programs, and st udents in certain graduate programs may participate in UAB's Cooper a- tive Education Program, combining their studies with paid work exper iences.

Concurrent and Combined Degree Pr ograms UAB offers students several opportunities to pursue two advanced degrees concurrently. The majority of these pr o- grams permit students to pursue both a research d egree (such as th e Ph.D. or M.S.) and a professional degree (such as the M.D., D.M.D., O.D., or M.P.H.) simultaneously. The Grad u- 8 This fee is assessed when a student fails to complete the th e- sis or dissertation by the deadline for the semester following the semester of the final d efense. ate School is eager to cooperate with all qualified students who wish to extend their professional capabilities into the area of independent sch olarship, originality, and research that ch a- racterize graduate study. A student already participating in one degree program but wishing to be enrolled in two programs concu rrently should submit with application materials a written statement of su p- port and approval from the director of the program of his or her original enrollment. Students not already enrolled at UAB should make their concurrent d egree interest known on the application form.

Wilburn, Adjunct Professor (Accounting); Legal Studies Mission and Objective The mission statement of the Department of Accounting and Information Systems is as follows: \"The Depar tment of Accounting and Information Systems itted to provid- ing a high -quality, practice- oriented educational experience to a largely urban population. The Department will offer, through its accounting programs, an educational foundation that will prepare students for professional careers in business and a c- counting or enable them to pursue graduate studies. The D e- partment will co ntribute to the understanding and application of accounting and business knowledge through the scholarship activities of the faculty. The Department will maintain a co n- tinuing relationship with the professional community while supporting the internal activ ities of the University.\" The objective of the Master of Accounting Program is to further develop in students the skills required for suc cess in the accounting profession. Off ered primarily in an evening format, it is d esigned for those individuals with a knowledge base in accounting and business who desire to broaden their communication, interpersonal, technological, and applied r e- search skills. The Master of Accounting Progra m is a ccredited by the AACSB International \u2014The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ( www.aacsb.edu). Admission Requirements Requirements for admission to the program include either of the fo llowing: 1. A bachelor's degree in accounting received from an inst i- tution accredited by AACSB Intern ational, or 2. A bachelor's degree received from an institution accr e- dited by a regional accrediting association and the co m- pletion of course work equivalent to the account ing m a- jor. All academic work must have been completed within the last ten years, although consideration may be given to signif i- cant postgraduate accounting experience if the aca demic work is not current. A \"catalog match\" evaluation report prepared by Educ ational Credential Evaluators, Inc. (ECE, www.ece.org ) is required of applicants whose degrees are from foreign institutions. A satisfactory score on the GMAT administered by the Graduate Management Admission Cou n- cil (www.gmac.org) is r equired of all applicants. In addition, a satisfactory score on the TOEFL ( www.toefl.org ) is required of those whose de grees are from foreign institutions. Test scores on these examinations may be no more than five years old. Adequate communication and computer skills are e x- pected of all en trants. Applicants meeting these requirements will be further evaluated on the basis of a formula that incorporates both the GMAT score and the undergraduate GPA. The strength of academic performance in previous accoun ting course work will be considered as a significant factor in the admission d e- cision as well. Admission to the program is competitive; the number of qualified applicants adm itted may be limited when resource constraints and optimum enrollment consider ations so dictate. Program Description The program consists of 30 semester hours of graduate credit in one of two concentrations: Accounting Practice or Information Systems. While completion of either will satisfy the academic provisions (i.e., the 150 -hour requir ement) of Alabama's Accountancy Laws, the former tends to be more directed toward preparing candidates for professional certif i- cation e xams. The Accounting Practice concentration provides students with the opportunity to expand their knowledge and unde r- standing of the various disciplines within the pr ofession through 24 hours of accounting -related course work. It also offers them the flexibility to tailor their graduate ed ucation to meet sp ecific career goals and objectives by selecting 6 hours of sp ecialized elective courses. The Information Systems concentration provides students with the opportunity to develop their information technology skills and their awareness of the role inform ation plays within an organization and its various accounting functions. Acco r- dingly, the concentration includes 15 hours of course work in information systems and 15 hours of a ccounting courses. Program Requirements The Accounting Practice co ncentration consists of eight required courses and two elec tives: Required courses -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 20 LS 557 Business Law for A ccountants AC 514 Fund Accounting AC 552 Income Taxation II AC 580 Advanced Financial Accounting AC 601 Strategic Cost Manag ement AC 603 Advan ced Accounting Information Sy stems AC 606 Current Problems in Auditing AC 620 Tax Planning and R esearch Elective courses AC 600 Financial Reporting Stra tegy AC 621 Corporate Tax AC 628 Taxation of Wealth Tran sfers AC 633 Information Systems Audi ting Any 600- level MBA courses beyond the core The Information Systems concentration consists of ten r e- quired courses: AC 600 Financial Reporting Strategy AC 601 Strategic Cost Manag ement AC 603 Advanced Accounting Information Sy stems AC 606 Current Problem s in Audi ting AC 633 Information Systems Audi ting MBA 611 Management Information Sy stems IS 501 Database Management IS 502 Telecommunications Ma nagement IS 521 Systems Analysis IS 522 Advanced Systems Analysis and Problem Solving Students who have c ompleted course work with content substantially equivalent to any of the required courses must consult with the Master of Accounting Program Director to determine suitable alternatives. Uniform CPA Examination The state of Alabama requires that applicants for the Un i- form CPA Examination hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and possess a total of 150 semester hours of postsecondary education, including at least 33 semester hours of accounting in specified areas at the u pper-division or graduate level. There are three ways that UAB students can meet these requir ements: (1) By obtaining a Master of Accounting degree in either of the two concentrations described above. Under the state's Accountancy Laws, those who hold graduate degrees from accounting programs accredited by AACSB International (as is UAB's) meet the academic requirements for taking the Un i- form CPA Examination. (2) By obtaining a Master of Business Administration de- gree with an Accounting concentration. Those who a lready hold an undergraduate accounting degree (or its equivalent) and who desire a graduate degree in business may establish their eligibility under the state's Accountancy Laws by co m- pleting as part of their M.B.A. r equirements 12 semester hours of graduate account ing course work as determined by the Ma s- ter of Accounting Program Director. Students interested in this option should contact the Admissions Counselor in the Gradu- ate School of Man agement. (3) By obtaining an undergraduate accounting degree (or its equivalent) and completing certain additional course work as specified under the state's Accountancy Laws. Students interested in this option should contact the undergraduate a d- visors' office in the School of Business for specific gui dance. Those interested in th is option who already hold degrees from other institutions should also contact the undergraduate bus i- ness advisors. Other Professional Accounting Cert ifications Other examinations leading to professional certification (CMA, CIA, etc.) generally do not r equire academic course work beyond the baccalaureate degree. Students interested in other accounting certifications should contact an undergr a- duate bus iness advisor or any member of the accounting facu l- ty for further information.

Other forms of fina n- cial assistance include minority fello wships offered through the UAB Graduate School, paid teaching opportunities in s e- lected undergrad uate programs, and federal student loans. Prerequisites Prerequisite requirements include one graduate -level sta- tistics course with computer usage and one graduate -level course on the U.S. health care system. Incoming students who have not met these prerequisites during a master 's program may take courses prior to entering the program or du ring their first year of study in the program. Program of Study The program of study consists of five components (1) courses in administratio n and health systems, (2) courses in research methodology and statistics, (3) specializa tion courses, (4) comprehensive examinations, and (5) the doctoral dissert a- tion. Specializations are currently available in strategic man-agement and health services r esearch. Students must complete all coursework in the first three areas and pass a comprehe n- sive examination in each b efore work can officially begin on the dissertation. The investigation and other special work lea d- ing to the dissertation must be performed directly under the guidance and supervision of a five -person commi ttee of the UAB graduate faculty. The normal minimum period in which the do ctoral degree can be earned is three to four years of full - time study. Degree Completion The granting of the Ph.D. degree is based on completion of all required coursework, residency requirements, compr e- hensive examinations, dissertation requirements, and the re c- ommendation of the Administration -Health Services gradua te program director and the dissertation committee. Mission, Vision, and Values Stat ements Because outstanding teaching and research are essen tial to the future of health care delivery in our nation and abroad, the Ph.D. program in Administration- Health Services provides doctoral- level training to individuals who will be our future health care leaders in academic and nonacademic research organiz ations. We seek to recruit a diverse and talented group of nat ional and international students who are attracted to careers in r e- search and teaching. The educational experience in the Ph.D. program is characterized by exposure to the various disci p- lines rele vant to health administration and policy from across the uni versity, as well as one -on-one mentorship relationships with faculty. These experiences are expected to serve as a foundation for future research throughout the graduate c areers.

Students who complete thi s program are expected to make significant future contributions in research in the basic biomedical sciences and to teach future gener a- tions of competent and productive r esearch scientists. The program consists of a core curriculum that emph asiz- es (a) the multidisciplinary and quantitative aspects of modern biomedical sciences; (b) a diversity of laboratory r esearch training experiences; and (c) the development of skills in rea d- ing, writing, and speaking. Advanced st udents take courses and tutorials in spec ialized areas of interest, partici pate in s e- minars, and have opportunities to gain teaching e xperience while satisfying other requirements for their doctoral pr o- grams. Areas of specialization for Ph.D. dissertation research i n- clude general and intermediary metabolism; molecular bio lo- genetics; physical biochemistry; biological membranes, mistry. Admission Requirements and Fina ncial Aid There are two avenues for entry into graduate study in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics. The department participates in the multidisciplinary Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB) Program, which is designed to pr o- vide a first -year curriculum to graduate students interested in the broad area of cellular and m olecular biology. At the en d of the first year, each CMB student chooses a mentor and elects to pursue a degree in biochemistry, in cell biology, in micr o- biology or in ne urobiology. Alternatively, prospective students with a specific interest in biochemistry may choose to apply directly to faculty in the Department of Biochemistry and M o- lecular Genetics for admission to graduate study. The first - year curriculum provides students with a comprehensive e xpe- rience in biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, neurobi ol- ogy, virology, and i mmuno logy. The CMB admissions committee considers applications for admission to the Ph.D. program from prospective graduate students who present evidence of superior scholarship and who have completed courses in general, organic, and physical chemistry; ma thematics, including ca lculus; and physics. Completion of courses in biology, including genetics and bi o- chemistry, is also recommended. Students with M.S., M.D., D.D.S., and D.V.M. degrees are also encou raged to apply. Admission criteria for the Ph.D. prog ram are those of the Graduate School, plus a personal interview. Students ac cepted into the program during the last several years have had an a v- erage score of greater than 600 on the quantitative section of the GRE General Test and 1,200 on the combined verbal and quantitative sections. These stu dents also have had average unde rgraduate GPAs of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. All students accepted into the program are provided fellowships or trainee- ships. Fellows and trainees are required to undertake full -time studies and are not permitted to do any other remunerative work. Financial sup port will be continued for up to five years, provided that the student's performance is satisfactory. During the 2002- 2003 academic year, entering students will be pr o- vided wit h stipends of over $18,000 per year, single health coverage, and funds for tu ition and fees. These amounts are reviewed yearly. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Jamila I.

Coursework, Thesis, and Dissertation A dissertation embodying the results and analysis of an original experimental investigation is required for Ph.D. ca n- didates. S tudents in the M.S. program may write a thesis based on a research project (Plan I) or, alternatively, may elect to submit a nonresearch project incorporating a review and anal-ysis of one or more topics of cu rrent or historical interest in biology (Plan II ). Since scientific problems encountered today are multif a- ceted and require multidisciplinary approaches, students are expected to acquire a broad background in the physical and life sciences. Doctoral students must complete fo rmal course work in or have e quivalent training related to six of the fo l- lowing seven areas: ecology, physiology, cell biology, dev e- lopmental biology, genetics, microbiology, and molecular biology. Master's students must have co mpetency in five of these life -science areas. Each studen t is also expected to sati s-factorily complete a course or sequence in biometry and any advanced courses designated by the student's graduate study committee consi stent with the chosen area of specialization. Each student must also enroll in three seminar c ourses approved by his or her graduate study committee, and one of the seminars must be outside the student's primary area of sp e- cialization. Also, each student is required to demonstrate pr o- ficiency in teaching by delivering formal course lectures or by conducting instructional lab oratories. Examinations To qualify for candidacy, a student in the master's pr o- gram must satisfactorily complete either a written or an oral comprehensive examination. A doctoral student must take both written and oral comprehens ive examinations. As part of a student's final defense of his or her dissertation, thesis or comprehensive review paper (Plan II), a public departmental seminar must be presented. Class A Teaching Certification Under the Alabama Department of Education's \" Stren g- thened Subject Matter Option,\" students who complete r e- quirements for the master's degree in biology can also receive class A teaching certification, providing that certain prerequ i- sites and requirements are met.

(An M.P.H. program is o ffered through the School of Public Health.) The programs provide a balance between theory and appli cation, the perspective being the role of statistics and modeling in scie ntific research. The objective is to produce research -oriented scientists who can advance statistical and modeling theory and interact effe ctively with scientists in other di sciplines to advance knowledge in those fields. Members of the department conduct research in stati s- tical metho dology and applications as well as in fundamental problems of modeling biological systems. Much of the de- partment's research is collaborative in nature, i nvolving pa r- ticipation in projects from basic science, clinical med icine, public health, and other health- related areas both within and outside UAB. Members of the department are actively i n- volved in the development of grant proposals in these fields. This participation involves experimental and study design, form design, database design, data quality assurance and co n- trol, data analysis and formal interpret ation of results. Faculty and students in this department are involved in activities relating to the development and understanding of biostatistical models with their associated statisti cal theory and to the application of these models to the analysis of data co l- lected in many different experimental situations. These e xpe- rimental situations include statis tically designed laboratory experiments, prospective and retrospective epidemiological studies, survey research, behavioral research and clinical r e- search including, but not limited to, clinical trials, among ot h- ers. The graduate program in biostatistics w as created to be a balanced program with both theoretical and applied aspects of biostatistics covered. Sufficient theory is ne cessary to enable the Ph.D. student to read and evaluate the theoretical bases underlying past and current statistical methodolog ical devel- opment and to contribute to that development in a nontrivial manner and to enable the mas ter's student to chose among available methodologies in an informed manner. Realizing, however, that the most important theory is often driven by a need for new models and new data analysis tools in particular UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 35 applications, this program is conceived as a serendipitous ma r- riage of both theory and application. The biostatistics core for statistics majors includes a two -semester theory sequence in probability and inference and a third course in the th eory of linear models which is required for students going on for the Ph.D., along with a simultaneous three -semester applied s e- quence. The first semester of the applied sequence provides a general introduction to com monly used, elementary statistical methods; the second is a matrix -based, applied regres- sion/linear models course; and the third is a course in exper i- mental design and analysis of var iance. More advanced courses cover such fundamental areas as sampling the ory, advanced analysis of variance, multivariate analysis, discrete data models, generalized linear models, advanced inference, survival analysis and nonlinear modeling. Advanced courses typically are o ffered in alternate years. All advanced courses contai n both theoretical and applied compo nents. The M.S. Degree Both Plan I and Plan II master's programs are avai lable in biostatistics. For students planning to go on to the Ph.D., Plan I is highly recommended. For Plan I, an M.S. thesis is r e- quired. This wi ll give the student experience with theoretical development of one or more statistical met hods as well as their application to real data. The write -up plan is similar to that required for a dissertation, and final copies are submitted to the Graduate Schoo l. Plan II students are required to co m- plete an extra 3 -hour course (compared with Plan I students) in addition to developing, writing up, and presenting a de tailed research project. The project is usually a thorough discussion, review of methods, and anal ysis of a more complex data set. Projects do not, in general, take as much adaptation of the statistical methods used as do theses and do not normally i n- volve development of new methodo logy. The M.S. program has been revised slightly this year (2001- 2002). The revision requires a number of specific courses in addition to the old M.S. core and also r equires courses in an applications area such as epidemiology. This is effective immediately for all newly admitted st udents. In addition, all students completing a M.S. in the Biosta- tistics Department are required to take the Master's Exit E x- amination. For students planning to go on for the doctoral de- gree, this test serves also as the first test of the three required doctoral, qualifying examinations. M.S.

Notes: BST 621 and 623- have a man datory labor a- tory. BST 690 may be repeated for credit. The Ph.D. Degree Students entering the Ph.D. program without prior grad u- ate work in statistics or biostatistics culminating in an M.S. will be required to begin with the master's course work (See the section on the M.S. degree.). It will be their option whether to obtain the M.S., but the department a dvises that they do so for their own protection. Students admitted to the Ph.D. pr o- gram with advanced standing because of a previous M.S. in statis tics or biostatistics may be asked to take a placement examination similar in character to the department's Ma ster's Exit Examination, which is also used as the first step in the three required doctoral examinations. Earning a Ph.D. is a matter of proving competen cy. This should include a general competency in the basic areas of b i- ostatistics: probability, inference (both intermediate and a d- vanced), theory of linear models, regression methods, inter-mediate experimental design and analysis of variance, survey sampli ng, nonlinear regression, st ochastic processes, discrete data analysis, clinical trials and survival analysis, nonparam e- trics, linear and exploratory multi variate methods, advanced analysis of variance, and generalized linear models (including longitudinal methods). Continuing to take some hours in Bi os- tatistical Consulting (BST 690) is always appropriate. Other specific courses on special areas within each of these general topics (e.g., time series analysis) may also be useful. Most practicing statisti cians find that a solid general knowledge of all of these is very helpful to them in their daily collaborative and consultative work as professional biostatis ticians. Some doctoral -level courses require more mathematical knowledge than courses in the M.S. cur riculum. In pa rticular, -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 36 the student will need the content of Advanced Calculus I, II and III (MA 440 -442 at UAB) to be well prepared to take A d- vanced Probability I and Advanced Inference I. We also r e- quire BST 633 (Theory of Linear Models I) and BST 645 (Discrete Data Analysis) if they have not previously been tak- en at the M.S. level. So a student might have from 0 to 15 hours of prerequ isites to take before proceeding to the upper level theory courses. In addition, 30 hours of biostatistics u p- per-level cou rses and 9 hours from a chosen minor in an appl i- cations area are required. Appropriate supporting program areas include, but are not limited to, physiology, microbiol o- gy, epidemiology, health behavior, health care organiz ation and policy, etc. Typically a student will have an additional six to twelve hours in dissertation research. Therefore, the total number of hours for a student not nee ding to take prerequisites will range from 42 to 48, while the hours for one needing to take all the prerequisites will range from 57 to 63. A total of three doctoral examinations must be passed and a dissertation proposal accepted by a student's graduate co m- mittee before a student is admitted to cand idacy for the Ph.D. The first is the M.S. exit examination, which should b e taken as soon as possible upon admission to the Ph.D. program, if not before. The second r equires content from advanced courses the student has taken and is administered by a depar t- mental committee set up for that purpose. After this examin a- tion has been passed, the student takes an oral examination in the areas in which he or she has taken coursework. Typically some questions aimed at the proposed research area are i n- cluded.

A demonstrated proficiency in comp u- ting is required. It is preferred that students have additional advanced mathematics courses, such as differential equations, advanced calculus including sp ecial functions, and complex analysis. Some background in the natural sciences would be helpful. The department requires a TOEFL score of at least 600 for all foreign students whose native language is not Eng-lish. The GRE and GPA requirements are the same as those of the Grad uate Scho ol. That is, scores of 550 or better on each of the three sections (verbal, quant itative and analytic) of the GRE General Test are preferred.

The program is part of the Tox i- cology Feeder Program, recruiting and admitting students, providing the core cur riculum, and facilitating laboratory rota- tions in the first year. A student in good standing after co m- pleting the core curriculum will identify a mentor and co m- plete electives and dissertation research in a participating d e- gree-granting program. Faculty and mentors are drawn from Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Comparative Medicine, Env i- ronmental Health Sc iences, Epidemiology, Gene Therapy, Medicine, Nutrition Sciences, Oncology Subspecialties, P a- thology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Physiology, and Pr e- ventive Medicine. We have identified 6 broad -based research foci, trad ition- tion, mechanisms of growth control, cancer pharmacology, gene therapy, and targeted immunotherapy. These criteria fo s- ter opportuni ties for collaboration and produce a trainee with diverse expertise in breast cancer research. Trainees with i n- terdisciplinary education and training will have better insight and be more innovative in research and diagnosis, and in pr e- venting and trea ting breast cancer. Financial Assistance Stipends and tuition are available via a federally funded training grant. In a ddition to an interest in breast cancer, the admission committee looks for students that have an educ a- tional background in chemistry, biology, biochemistry and, if possible, one or more courses in molecular biology, physiol o- gy, and/or cell biology. The appl icant should have a GPA of 3.0 or better and a score of 1100 or better on the combined verbal and quantitative GRE. A campus visit and interv iew are strongly encou raged.

The goal of the graduate program in Cell Biology (C B) is to prepare research -oriented individuals for careers as ind e- pendent academic or industrial scientists. Each student is counseled and guided by faculty and staff and interacts with a variety of postdoctoral fellows and other graduate st udents. Thus, t hrough both formal and informal discussion, the st u- dent is challenged to consider a wide range of scientific ques-tions and methodologies and is encouraged to relate these to the particular scientific e ndeavor he or she is pursuing. The student is expected to gain a broad research back- ground through active participation in formal courses and through hands -on research. In addition to the r esearch -oriented course offerings within the department, the student is expected to expand his or her knowledge by underta king relevant coursework in biochemistry, statis tics, physiology, molecular biology, and immunology. Each student's pr ogram is tailored to meet the student's needs and scientific interests. A student usually rotates through at least three i ndependent labor atories (10 weeks each) before identifying a permanent laboratory where his or her formal research for the Ph.D. degree will be done. The Ph.D. program, including coursework, research, and dissertation, usually requires a commitment of at least four to five years, depending on the background of the st udent. The program allows specialization in all areas of cell b i- ology, including neurobiology. The program houses a ctive, well-funded research projects that are indicated in the preced- ing faculty roster. In add ition to UAB Graduate School admis- sion requirements, the program requires a baccalaureate d e- gree with a major emphasis in science, a B average in all courses and a slightly higher average in science coursework, and a minimum score of 1,100 on combined verbal and qua n- titative sections of the GRE General Test. Ph.D. Program Although it is expected that most students will enter the program with an advanced biological science back ground, exceptionally promising students with deficiencies in biolog i- cal studies w ill be accepted into the program with the proviso that they take the necessary remedial cours ework, usually while they simultaneously pursue r esearch within the program. The successful student will, by the end of his or her graduate tenure, have an ability both to carry out i ndependent research and to contribute to a teaching program in modern cell biol o- gy. Following completion of basic coursework (usually one - and-a-half to two years), each student is required to pass a qualifying examination. This examinat ion is stru ctured to (1) test the student's ability to design a comprehensive research proposal that addresses a problem within an area of cell bio lo- gy, (2) determine the breadth of the student's knowledge in modern biological sciences, and (3) examine the student's un- derstanding of current concepts in cell biology. After succes s- ful completion of this examination by a graduate faculty committee, the student is admitted to ca ndidacy. All entering graduate students will be awarded fello w- ships plus full payment of tuition, fees, and insurance pr e- miums. No teaching responsibilities are attendant to the fe l- lowship accep tance. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. James F.

Faculty mentors in this program have primary or secondary appointments in the D e- partments of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Cell Bio l- ogy, Microbi ology, or Neurobiol ogy. The students enrolled in this program, therefore, have over 120 potential research l a- boratories in which to pursue their doctoral train ing. The CMB Program administers an intensive, year -long core curriculum designed to provide ente ring graduate st u- dents with a comprehensive introduction to the broad fields of cellular and molecular biology. The core curriculum i ncludes courses in biomolecules, genetics, cells, signaling, virology and immunology, and special topics. In addi tion, stud ents are exposed to on- going research projects as they rotate through three different laboratories during their first nine months of residency. Students enter the CMB Program with the intent of using their classroom and laboratory exper iences during the fi rst year to help them further define their research i nterests. The minimum admission criteria are those of the Graduate School (B-level scholarship and a combined score of 1,100 on the verbal and quantitative sections of the GRE General Test) and -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 48 a suitable background in the biological and physical sciences. Students for whom English is a second language are also r e- quired to take the TOEFL examination. At the end of their first year in graduate school, CMB students who successfully complete the first -year c urriculum select an advisor and b e- come affiliated with the graduate program of one of the four participating depar tments. Advanced courses in CMB are then offered by the four individual departments. The CMB Program, ther efore, acts as a mechanism for allow ing students to be admitted into grad u- ate school in this general area while maintaining as broad a spectrum of potential research mentors as possible. The pr o- gram is highly interdiscipli nary, and students benefit from the strong interrelationships between the basic science depar t- ments and between the basic and clinical sciences. This inter- disciplinary approach and the ready willingness to work t o- gether to share ideas and metho dologies have played a major role in UAB's rise to international prominence in man y fields of research. Such interactions also allow graduate research experiences to move at a pace and in directions that might not be anticipated at the outset of thesis work. The program an tic- ipates admitting 25 -30 students each year.

After being admitted to the graduate program and before registering for any grad u- ate chemistry courses, the student must take placement exam i- nations. Based upon the results of these examinations, some stude nts may be required to take speci fied remedial work on a pass/fail basis before enrollment in the core courses; a pass must be obtained in each remedial course for continuation in UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 49 the program. Other students may be exempted from certain core courses and can proceed to a more ad vanced course level. All chemistry graduate students are required to take a t o- tal of 18 semester hours of courses that include CH 601/701, 602/702 and four other courses selected from nine courses offered by the department or courses outside the department when career objectives suggest a knowledge base that can be best acquired in this manner. The choice should reflect ind i- vidual career objectives. To co ntinue in the Ph.D. program, the student must earn a grade of B or better in each of the selected core courses. To continue in the M.S. program, the student must earn a B aver age or better in the 18 semester hours of core courses. One repeat of any of these courses is allowed to raise grades. All graduate students must present a departm ental liter a- ture seminar after the third quarter of enrollment. A minimum of one quarter of teaching experience is required of all grad u- ate students. Prior to the conclusion of the third quarter of enrollment, the student should select a major professor. T his selection occurs after the student has interviewed each grad u- ate faculty member in the Department of Chemistry. The st u- dent and the major profe ssor will recommend to the director of the graduate pr ogram in chemistry the composition of the graduate stud y of the Adv i- sory Committee. Master's students choose from the 600 courses, Ph.D. st u- dents from t he 700 courses. M.S. Program Plan I Plan I is a research program that requires a minimum of 24 semester hours (including 18 semester hours of core courses) of formal academic coursework approved by the st u- dent's graduate study committee. The progress of th e student's research program is monitored by the graduate study commi t- tee. The student, having been admitted to candidacy and hav- ing completed an approved plan of research, will co mplete and defend a thesis. Plan II Plan II is a nonthesis program that requires a min imum of 30 semester hours (including 18 semester hours of core courses) of appropriate graduate work that has been ap proved by the student's graduate study committee. Ph.D. Program For Ph.D. students, there are no specific course requir e- ments bey ond the core courses. The academic program is d e- termined through the action of the student's grad uate study committee. A written qualifying examination must be passed in the student's area of specialization. If failure o ccurs, only one repeat exam is allow ed. A research proposal must be d e- fended within 12 months of completion of the written qualif y- ing examination. If failure occurs, one repeat defense is al- lowed. The st udent, having been admitted to candidacy and having completed an approved plan of research, will submit a dissertation to the Graduate School. This dissertation must be defended at an open meeting. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Larry K.

Jeff, Associate Professor (Diagnostic and Th e- rapeutic Sciences); Clinical Microbiology; Educationa l Me- thodol ogy Victor Associate Professor (Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences); Clinical Chemi stry; Toxicology Program Information Program Mission The faculty members are committed to service to the community and to providing quality education t o prepare st u- dents and practitioners for the current and future in clinical laboratory sciences. The faculty, in its concern for the health and safety of the general public, is committed to ensuring that each st udent develops knowledge, skills, and values essential to the appropriate role providing the basis for continuing inte l- lectual and pr ofessional growth. The Master of Science in Clinical Laboratory Science (M.S.C.L.S.) is a part -time or full -time graduate degree pr o- gram with two plans for degree compl etion: profe ssional entry and postprofessional entry. The postprofessional entry plan enables professionals who hold a baccalaureate degree and certification (or eligibility for certific ation) as a Medical Technologist (ASCP) or Clinical Laboratory Scientist (NCA) to prepare for advanced tech nical and administrative career opportunities. Through courses, research, and project or thesis preparation, M.S.C.L.S. students can enhance their proficiency in clinical laboratory science disciplines, including immun o- hematology, chemistry, hematology, laboratory operations, informatics, or microbiology. For previously certified medi cal technologists, certification as a specialist is available in some disciplines upon completion of specific requirements esta b- lished by n ational certification age ncies. Examples of positions graduates may prepare for include the following: technical consultant with advanced technical prof iciency operations manager of a clinical laboratory clinical laboratory educator within a selected specialty discipline quality assurance/improvement manager clinical laboratory human r esources manager clinical laboratory information systems manager. The professional entry plan is designed for students who hold a Bachelor of Science in biology, chemistry , or a related major, and who are not certified medical tec hnologists but who desire a career in clinical laboratory science. Such st u- dents, upon completion, will be eligible to take a national e x- amination for certification as a Medical Technologist or Cli ni- cal Laboratory Scientist. The professional entry plan requires 24 months as a full - time student for completion of the degree requirements. The postprofessional plan time requirement is dete rmined by whether a student is a full - or part -time st udent. The program is jointly sponsored by Clinical Laboratory Sciences in the School of Health R elated Professions (SHRP) and the Department of Pathology in the School of Joint Health Sciences. M.S.C.L.S. Admission Requirements In addition to the general Graduate Sc hool admission requir e- ments, applicants to the M.S.C.L.S. program must possess a baccalaureate degree in medical technology, biology, chemistry, or a related major from an accredited college or unive rsity, have a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0 (A = 4.0), computed from all undergraduate credits or from the last 60 semester hours of unde rgraduate course credit, earn scores of at least 500 in each of the verbal and quan- titative sections of the GRE General Test, if applicant is a clinical laboratory scientis t, provide ev i- dence of certif ication, provide a written statement of career goals, if foreign -educated, have a score of at least 550 on the TOEFL and submit a transcript evaluation from an ac- ceptable agency, and if accepted, complete the UAB medical histo ry questio n- naire and physical, provide proof of required immuniz a- tions, and receive satisfactory screening by the UAB Medical Center Student Health Service before enrol lment. Persons with a Bachelor of Science who are not certified me d- ical technologists sh ould have completed natural science and mathematics courses equivalent to those r equired for a Bach e- lor of Science in Medical Technology (described in SHRP Catalog). Persons with a Bachelor of Science or who are certified clinical laboratory practitioners may be eligible to register for some of the courses offered through the nond egree path of registration. These students can take up to 12 credits hours of graduate course work. If these students meet the program ad- mission requirements, then these credits m ay be accepted t o- ward the M.S.C.L.S. degree at the discretion of the M.S.C.L.S. faculty, program director, and faculty adv isor. Admission of a student to any course as a nondegree student does not const i- tute admission to the M.S.C.L.S. degree pr ogram. Essential Requirements Fundamental tasks, behaviors, and abilities necessary to successfully complete the academic and clin ical/residency requirements of the program and to satisfy licensure pr certif i- cation requirements, if any, have been outlined and are av aila- ble upon request from the academic program office. Students requesting disability accommod ations must do so by filing a disability accommodation request in writing with the academic program office. M.S.C.L.S. Program of Study The purpose of the program is to prepare graduates with technical, cognitive, interpersonal, and critical thin king skills required of practitioners who are associated with the oper a- tions of clinical laboratory sciences and services.

Coordinated Degrees Degree Requirements Through UAB's coordinated degree programs, ou tstand- ing students with appropriate career goals may be al lowed to pursue two advanced degrees concurrently. (The ge neral pol i- cy is that students pursue only one degree at a time.) The majority of these programs permit students to pursue both a research degree (such as the PhD. Or M.S.) and a pr o- fessional degree (such as the M.D., D.M.D., O.D., or M.P.H.) simultaneously . The Graduate School is eager to cooperate with all qualified students who wish to extend their profe s- sional capabilities into the areas of independent scholarship, originality, and research characterizing graduate study. Medical Scientist Training Progra m: M.D. -Ph.D. research and clinical trai ning pr o- grams provide an unusual opportunity for students interested in careers in basic biomedical research. Such students may be admitted concurrently to the School of Med icine and the Graduate School in order to pursue both the M.D. degree and the Ph.D. degree. Ph.D. study in this program is available in the broad areas of biochemistry, molecular genetics, and bi o- physical sciences, cell biology, m icrobiology, neurobiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology. Individuals admitted to this highly compe titive program must have an outstanding MCAT score and appropriate un- dergraduate training and must provide evidence of a genuine interest in research. A laboratory research experience is co nsi- dered an important asset. Fellowship support, including a sti- pend and payment of tuition and fees, is provided to su ccessful applicants. In general, M.D. -Ph.D. students will complete the basic science phase of the medical curriculum; appropriate substit u- tions will be made to provide more detailed and more r e- search -oriented fundamental course work. The second phase of study will include advanced graduate courses in the area of Ph.D. specialization, as well as compl etion of the dissertation. Finally, the student will partic ipate in the required clinical rotations. A seven - to eight -year period of study will usually be required. All application materials for the M.D. -Ph.D. program must be received no later than December for admission in the following summer or fall term. Students who have initiated study in the school of Me di- cine may also apply for Graduate School admission. Graduate study can be pursued during the summer, during time sche-duled electives in the medical curriculum, or at other times with permission of the dean of the School of Medicine. Alter- natively, upon ap proval of the a ppropriate graduate program director and the dean of the School of Medicine, a student may be granted a temporary leave from the medical curriculum to complete the r equirements for a graduate degree. Approval for pursuit of Ph.D. d egrees res ts with the Graduate School and the appropriate graduate program or department. Students should contact the graduate program director of the program in which they wish to enroll.

Each year, students are admitted to the M.S.C.J. program for the fall term. The application dea dline is May 1. Students may be admitted to the M.S.C.J. program \"in good standing\" provided they meet all minimum admission criteria established by the Graduate School and have taken an introduc tory-level statistics and an introductory -level research methods course in which a grade of B or better was earned in each course. St u- dents who otherwise meet the minimum admi ssion criteria but have not taken one or both of these courses, may be admitted to the M.S.C.J. program on a \"contingency\" basis. Students so admitted will not be allowed to register for graduate cours e- work until the contingencies are removed. Students meeting the minimum req uirements for admission but lacking a sub s- tantive back ground in criminal justice may be admitted to the M.S.C.J. program on a \"contingency\" basis, but will be r e- quired to undertake remedial cours ework before they will be allowed to register for any graduat e coursework. Students fai l- ing to meet the minimum requirements for admission, but who are reasonably close, may be admitted to the M.S.C.J. pr o- gram \"on pr obation.\" Students admitted on probation will be given the opportunity to establish and maintain a mi nimum GPA of 3.0 for all graduate coursework unde rtaken. Failing to do so will result in dismissal from the pr ogram. Degree Requirements Plan I (Thesis) Students selecting the Plan I option must (1) complete a minimum of 30 semester hours (24 of which are the r equired professional seminars JS 580 and JS 600- 606) and (2) propose and then complete a major research project under the direction of a thesis committee chaired by the st udent's major advisor. Students who select the Plan I option must establish and main- tain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all coursework undertaken (r e- quired and elective). Students failing to do so may be di s- missed from the pr ogram. Plan II (Nonthesis) Students selecting the Plan II option must (1) complete a minimum of 36 semester hours i n coursework, 24 hours of which consist of the required professional sem inars; (2) write a 20-25 page \"area paper\" in their area of substa ntive interest, and (3) pass a series of written comprehensive examinations -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 60 covering the areas of crimin ological theor y, research methods, statistics, criminal justice policy, and criminal justice admin is- tration. Students who select the Plan II option must establish and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all coursework unde r- taken (required and elective). Students failing to do so may be dismissed from the pr ogram. White Collar and Corporate Crime Specialization In conjunction with the M.B.A. program in the School of Business, students in the M.S.C.J. program may pursue a sp e- cializ ation in the investigation and prosecution of white collar and corporate offenders. Students choosing this specialization will take 15 -18 elective hours in cours ework. Information on the White Collar and Corporate Crime specialization is avai la- ble from the M.S.C.J. Pr ogram Director. Financial Aid Students who are admitted to the M.S.C.J. program \"in good standing\" are eligible to receive department -based fina n- cial aid in the form of research assistantships or scholarships that are awarded on a competitive basis. Students are typically notified of such awards in early June of each year for the fo l- lowing fall. Additional Information For detailed information contact Dr. John J.

The pr o- gram is a combination of the conventional work for the M.S. degree plus the achievement of proficiency in some phase of clinical dentistry. The course of study requires a minimum of two ac ademic years; most students will require three years to complete the work. The applicant must be a graduate of an accred ited school of dentistry and must have achieved, in both predental and dental requirements, a superior scholastic record. At the time of enrollment in the Graduate School, the st u- dent is assigned an appropriate faculty advisor, who works with the student in outlining a course of study consiste nt with objectives. This curriculum must cover the three areas of a selected phase of clinical dentistry, a related basic health science, and r esearch. Major and Minor The major field of study must be selected from the fo l- lowing: dental biomaterials, end odontics, general den tistry, hospital dentistry, maxillofacial prosthetics, oral surgery, o r- thodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, public health dentistry, or dental radiology. Not less than 18 semester hours of credit in the pr ogram must be in the major subject, with the minimum a cceptable grade being B. A minor must involve at least six semester hours of study in one or two basic health science departments related to the student's m ajor and research interests. By the time the stud ent has been in residence one year and has finished some of both major and minor courses, the student and the advisor should recommend to the Graduate School dean at least two additional graduate faculty members, one from the minor area, for appointment to the grad uate study committee. The student should discuss with this committee plans for the remaining course of study, including a proposed thesis title and outline of experimental design. Depending upon the na ture of the research plan, it may be desirable for a different advisor to be appointed, serving e ither as co -chair or as new chair of the graduate study committee. At this time, demonstration of a reading knowledge of one foreign la n- guage, competence in biostatistics, experience with computer techniqu es, or other tools of research may be required, as a p- propriate to the student's inve stigation. Admission to Candidacy When the graduate study committee is satisfied that the student is prepared to undertake the research, the student is admitted to candid acy for the master's degree. This step should be taken at least three semesters before the antici pated date of completion of the program. Research and Thesis Sufficient research work to train the candidate in the pri n- ciples and methods of scientific inve stigation is required. The research project should involve the student's own intensive work in some area of dentistry, preferably r elated to the basic health sciences. The thesis is based on the research study and must show the candidate's abi lity to delin eate a problem, plan its solution, and present the results of the work in an orderly fashion. Familiarity with the literature of the field is e xpected. Final Examination The final oral examination is administered by the stu dent's graduate study committee before the deadline is set by the Graduate School. The examination begins with oral present a- tion and defense of the thesis and may include any work fun- damental thereto. At the close of the examination, the commi t- tee votes on the candidate, ta king into acc ount all of the work undertaken. Majority approval is r equired.

Education General Information UAB's programs in education are fully approved by the Interstate Agreement on Qualifications of Educational Perso n- nel, the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Educ ation, and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. There are 13 graduate majors in the area of education; these are described in sections arranged alph a- betically following this general information section. Degrees and Certificates Degrees are awarded by UAB in recognition of scholastic achievement and may be pursued for their own sake. Ho wev- er, empl oyment in the public schools is governed not by the degree but by the professional Certificate issued by the Al a- bama State Department of Education (SDE). Since many st u-dents in these programs are preparing for work in the public schools, the pursuit of a d egree is usually coupled with pursuit of SDE certification. There is a rough corr espondence between degree level and certification class, as fo llows: Degree Level Certification Class Bachelor's B Master's A Specialist (post -master's) AA Doctoral No Equivalent In spite of this correspondence, we emphasize that the admi ssion and completion requirements for the degree and for the certificate are often significantly different. Furthermore, not all education students are pursuing SDE certification . Stu- dents seeking certification should verify requirements with an advisor or program dire ctor. Students who wish to add to an existing certificate through a SDE evaluation letter must be eligible for a dmission to the Graduate School. In addition, a copy of the SDE letter must be filed with the appropriate department chairperson and with Academic Advising Services, Room 100, School of Ed u- cation Building, before coursework is begun. In some i n- stances, prerequisites will have to be met in order to enroll in the d esired courses. Education, Curriculum and I nstruction (Ph.D., M.A., Ed.S., Ed.)

Numerous teaching fields are available. All prospective students must apply for admi ssion through the Graduate School. The M.A.Ed. program requires a minimum of 33 s emester hours of study, and the Ed.S. and AA programs require at least an additional 33 semester hours. All programs require a wri t- ten final examination. An outline of the specific course r e- quirements can be obtained from the office of the graduate program director or the Ac ademic Advising Office in the School of Education. The M.A.Ed. programs satisfy the ac a- demic requirements for t he State Department of Education Class A Professional Certificate. The Ed.S. programs satisfy academic requirements for the State Department of Education Class AA Professional Ce rtificate and an Ed.S. degree. The AA pr ograms satisfy AA certification requir ements, but do not lead to a degree. See also the section \"Education (General I n- formation)\" earlier in this cata log. The program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in early childhood education is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the in terests and previous preparation of the student, but it must include an internship and a substantial research component culminating in the completion of a disse r- tation. The minimum admission requirements are those of the UAB Graduate School. However, admis sion is highly sele c- tive, and most successful applicants have qualifica tions much higher than the minimum. Admission is open only once a n- nually, with the program of study beginning in June (summer term). Applic ation packets must be complete in the Graduate School of fice, at the latest, by six weeks before the program begins.

Health Education/Health Promotion (Ph.D.) The Ph.D. program in Health Education/Health Pr omotion has been designed to provide students with the academic and practical experiential background to become leading pract i- tioners and researchers in health education and health prom o- tion. The program combines the resources of aca demic units from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (School of Educ ation and School of Public Health) and the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa (College of Educa tion). Admission Student applications are reviewed by a joint admissions committee composed of members of the participating aca dem- ic units. Applicants should meet the admissions requir ements of the graduate school, including submittal of scores on the GRE. A dmission to the program is competitive, with ev idence of scholarship, career goals and research interest, pr ofessional recommendations, and professional experience among those factors receiving strong consideration. Cand idates for admi s- sion must have compl eted a bachelor's or ma ster's degree from an accredited institution in health education or a health -related field.

Counselor Education The graduate programs in counseling are designed to train students to make appropriate and ethical decisions as counsel- ing professionals. The most important of these decisions is the selection of strategies that empower clients to make personal decisions leading to the resolution of problems and r esulting in an improved quality of life. Clients represent the multicultural, multiethnic, and m ultivalues character of a diverse American society. Thus, counselors must unde rstand human behavior in terms of its psychological, physiological, and sociological influences and make professional decisions within the legal and ethical co nstraints that are applicable. Students in the counseling programs in the department are encouraged, aided, and expected to perceive themselves as professionals who work closely and cooper atively with other professionals, such as those in public and private school sys- tems, c olleges and universities, community and private pr o- grams and agencies, and government service agencies. Profe s- sionalism in this context means that st udents are aware of their own knowledge and skill levels, abilities, characteristics, and perspectives, and the respective limits thereof, and that they behave in accordance with the highest ethical and professional standards. Students are ex pected to demonstrate acquired knowledge and skills throughout the program. Through fee d- back and self -exploration, studen ts will gain a better unde r- standing of their responsibilities as counselors. All counseling programs (agency, rehabilitation, school) are designed to meet the course -work and field experiences requirements outlined in the accreditation sta ndards of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educ a- tional Programs (CACREP). In addition, the r ehabilitation counseling specialty area meets the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) certification requirements. The school counseling program meets t he course work and field expe- riences required by the Al abama State Department of Educ a- tion for certification. All programs meet the academic r e- quirements for licensure as professional counselors in Al a- bama. As a program strength, the faculty who teach the cou n--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 80 seling th eory and skills courses are professional counselors who partic ipate in limited practice in their sp ecialty areas. Agency Counseling Specialty The role of professional counseling has become increa- singly important as an effective source of perso nal assistance in dealing with a myriad of problems in a co mplex society. The counseling profession is alive with ideas and techniques based on developmental and behavioral theory and has estab-lished a rightful place among the helping professions. Coun- seling has a serious contribution to make toward the psycho- logical, social, and physical well -being of members of the community. We welcome the interest and inquiry of persons who feel a dedic ation to help ing others and who will commit to serious study of the theory, techniques, and related course work on which pr ofessional counseling pra ctice is based. The Master of Arts in Community Counseling is designed to prepare students to demonstrate knowledge and skills with several counseling modalities appropriate fo r a broad range of clients in a multicultural society; interact effectively with oth- er helping professionals and referral resources; make ap pro- priate counselor -client related decisions in the context of pr o- fessional, ethical, and legal guidelines; and fill effectively en- try-level positions of pr ofessional responsibility within the specialization of agency counsel ing.

ECG 697 may be taken for up to 9 semester hours (20 hours/week over 3 terms), which will extend program requirements to 51 semester hours. Rehabilitation Counseling Specialty The \"State of the Art\" in rehabilitation has changed as a result of to economic, social, and legal influences. The private rehabilitation sector, the holistic medical a pproach, along with the traditional rehabilitation program, h ave brought about a new mission to the rehabilitation program at UAB. The UAB Rehabilitation Counseling Training Program's mission i n- cludes a specific focus upon preparing students to meet the demands of private and public rehabil itation. The teaching miss ion is to provide knowledge, develop skills, and influence attitudes of grad uates who will work in private or public rehabilitation settings. This is accomplished through a multifaceted approach to learning that combines the many resources of a major university, medical center, and large u rban area. The program is designed to accommodate a student's past work and academic experiences, present work experience, and future profes sional goals. In addition to the teaching mission, each member of the faculty perf orms a se r- vice function for area agencies, institutions, and facilities ser v- ing children and adults with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Counseling Program is accredited n a- tionally by the Council On Rehabilita tion Education (CORE). The program in Rehabili tation Counseling requires a min- imum of 49 semester hours of course work. This includes 3 seme ster hours (120 clinical hours) of practicum and 6 to 9 semester hours (600 clinical hours) of internship. In addition, students can specialize in areas such as D eafness, Su bstance Abuse Counseling, and Mental Health Counseling. This would increase the number of required hours beyond the 49 credit hour minimum. The Rehabilitation Counseling faculty is committed to the enhancement of rehabilit ation counselor effecti veness.

Area IV: Electives (6 semester hours) School Counseling Specialty According to the American School Counseling Associ a- tion, \"the purpose of a counseling pr ogram in a school setting is to promote and enhance the learning process.\" The goal of the program is to enabl e all students to achieve success in school and to develop into contributing member of our soc ie- ty. We believe that professional school counselors value and honor diversity, equity, and equality of all pe ople. We believe that professional school counselor s must be proactive change agents and advocates for all peo ple. We believe that professional school counselors are obl i- gated to confront their own beliefs and assumptions and change biased behavior regarding sexism, ageism, r acism, and homophobia. We bel ieve that professional school counselors are eth i- cally obligated to strive toward optimum psychological health and to engage in self -care activities which attend to the physical, mental, spiritual, and psychological dime n- sions. We believe that academic pr eparation process must e m- phasize the application of theory to practice and enco m- pass opportunities for experiential learning throughout the program. The program of study will prepare st udents to 1. address student and family issues of concern that have adve rse affect on student achievement and suc cess. 2. promote, plan, and implement prevention programs r e- garding personal/social management and decision - making, college/career, and course selection and place- ment. 3. demonstrate leadership by promoting, planning, a nd im- plementing programs that are comprehensive, develo p- mental, and integrated into the total school curric ulum. 4. participate in the development for all students of follow - up activities that enhance personal growth and academic success. 5. consult and partic ipate with teams and individuals to e n- sure responsiveness and equity to cultural diversity issues as well as lear ning styles of all students. 6. collaborate with other helping agents (parents, agencies, community members). 7. participate in coordinating resour ces for all students, families, and staff. 8. be seen as a leader by faculty, parents, and students in defining and carrying out the role and function of school counselor. 9. demonstrate appropriate documentation relating to student success and well -being. 10. establish and assess measurable goals for student ou t- comes from counseling programs, activities, interve n- tions, and e xercises. 11. collaborate with staff members in developing staff trai n- ing regarding issues related to student academic, social, emotional, and d evelopmental needs on a school -wide b a- sis.

Program The Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering may be a terminal degree or pursued as part of the doctoral pr ogram. With the terminal degree, employment is us ually found in medical centers or with manufacturers of medical products, government agencies, health care groups, or computer applica- tion groups. Doctoral candidates prepare for courses in indu s- try or academics. Primary research areas are biomedical i m- plants and devices, electrophysio logy, and medical imaging. Other research areas available to include r egeneration. For admission to the program, a student should have earned a bachelor's degree in a field of engineering. St udents with undergraduate degr ees in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics will also be considered for admi s- sion; however, such students will be required to demonstrate competence in engineering areas usually found in an unde r- graduate engineering curriculum. In most cases, preparatory courses in engineering are required, with specific recommen-dations made by the st udent's Graduate Study Committee. Admission is competitive, and su ccessful applicants will usually present scores of at least 600 on the verbal, quantit a- tive, a nd analytical sec tions of the GRE General Test. Applicants are strongly encouraged (but not required) to take the GRE subject test. Applicants are normally r equired to personally interview the Admissions Committee on campus before they can be considered f or admission. Program requirements include the following: 1. The student must complete three 1 -hour sem inar courses. 2. The student must complete an additional 24 hours of coursework. Course requirements vary depending on the r e- search focus. 3. Plan I (the sis option) students must register for at least 6 semester hours of BME 699 (thesis research) and succes sful- ly defend a thesis based on independent r esearch. Plan II (no n- thesis option) students must take an additional 9 seme ster hours of graduate courses a pproved by the Graduate Study Committee and successfully defend an independent study project. Ph.D. Program All students entering the doctoral program will possess an M.S., D.M.D, or M.D. Degree. Admission is competitive, and successful applicants will usu ally present scores of at least 650 on the verbal, quantitative, and analytical se ctions of the GRE General Test. Applicants are normally required to interview the Admissions Committee on campus before they can be co n- sidered for admission. Coursework in engineering and related medical or life science areas is required (a minimum of 24 semester hours after completion of the master's degree, or 48 after the bachelor's degree). Additional coursework may be required in conjunction with the student's dissertatio n re- search. The program of study for each student is defined by the Grad uate Study Committee during the student's first year of doctoral study. Near the completion of the course plan, a written and oral comprehensive qualifying exam will be a dmi- nistered by the Committee and a written proposal for the dis- sertation research must be pr esented before the student can be admitted to candidacy for the degree. A dissertation that presents the results of the student's original research must be successfully d efended.

The program provides students with an understanding of basic mechanisms through which agents alter environmental, human, and ecosystem health, and the skills needed to evaluate and implement remediation for environmental problems, in the context of engineering and public health. Admission Requirements Students applying to the Environmental Health Enginee r- ing program must submit official transcripts an d GRE scores. In general, a combined GRE score of at least 1100 (verbal and quantitative) or 1500 (ve rbal, quantitative and analytical), and a minimum undergradu ate GPA of 3 on a 4 point scale are required for admission. Students for whom English is a second language should have a TOEFL score no less than 600. A d- mission on probation may be possible in some circumstances for students not meeting these requir ements. Admission decisions will be made by the admission committee, comprised of the EHE program dire ctor and co - director. The steering committee will appoint a faculty mentor for each student accepted. Based on their expressed area of interest. Students may change faculty mentors as their research interests develop. The faculty mentor will assist the stu dent in selection of coursework until a dissertation topic is selected, and a dissertation committee established. Enrollment Students are expected to remain continuously enrolled (fall and spring semesters) in the EHE program until the co m- pletion of their dissertation.

All me mbers of the GSC must be graduate faculty, and one must come from ou t- side the UA B English Department. Once constituted, member- ship of the GSC cannot be changed without the approval of the departmental graduate program commi ttee. 4. Before students can be admitted to candidacy, they must have passed 18 hours of course work and had a t hesis proposal accepted by their GSC and the departmental graduate program committee. 5. Students must pass a Thesis D efense. Plan II. 1. Nonthesis students must take 3 hours in Bibliography & Methods, 3 hours of linguistics, 12 hours of Bri t- ish/America n literature, and 12 hours of ele ctives. 2. 15 hours of course work must be at the 600 seminar level in English. 3.

Students are encouraged to secure this f a- culty mentor as early as possible since the chair of a student's GSC has primary responsibility f or mentoring the student through the exam process. The Committee chair must coord i- nate the composition, administration, and evaluation of all area tests for that st udent. The chair is also responsible for informing the st udent (and graduate program directo r) of the criteria for evaluation of the subject area tests; for notifying the student of the results; and for meeting with the student afterwards to review the tests. The chair is also responsible for keeping the graduate program director informed of the st u- dent's progress and maintaining a co mplete exam file on the student. 6. In consultation with the student and the graduate pr o- gram director, the Committee chair will appoint at least two other faculty to serve on the student's GSC. All members of the GS C must be graduate faculty. Once constituted, member- ship of the GSC cannot be changed wit hout the approval of the departmental graduate program commi ttee. 7. Each two -hour area test must follow a standard format that allows students to demonstrate their a bility to read closely and to synthe size ideas. a. Area tests in literature and critical theory will give the fo l- lowing instructions based on selections from the area read ing list: Choose one of the following passages and write an essay that (1) establis hes-based on the chosen passage- some signif icant literary, intellectual, and/or cultural context and presents a thesis having to do with that context; (2) explains, by a close -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 116 reading of the text, why the cho sen passage is important both to the work from w hich it is taken and to the thesis of the present essay; and (3) di scusses the context and thesis in rel a- tion to at least two other works from the area reading list. b. Area tests for Composition Pedagogy or Rhetorical Theory will give the following instr uctions based on s elections from the area reading list: Choose one of the following passages or set of passages and write an essay that (1) indicates your understanding of the passage(s) and the work from which it is taken; (2) identifies and explains the specific issues in rhetorical theory or comp o- sition pedagogy that are addressed by or related to the selec- tion(s); and (3) discusses these issues in a broader co ntext by drawing on at least two other works from the area reading list. c. See the Director of the Linguistics Program for a sa mple area test in Linguistics. 8. Students must provide their GSC with a minimum of three weeks' notice in scheduling area tests, which must be taken Monday -Friday during the tenth week of each semester. Unless a single area test remains to be taken, students should arrange to take at least two area tests during the same sem e- ster. 9. Students are limited to three attempts at passing a test for the same area. 10. The GSC will hold a group grading session to ev a- luate indi vidual tests as Failing, Passing, or High Pass (the latter desig nation must be a unanimous decision of the GSC). If a student earns four High Passes, this student will be passed \"With Dis tinction.\" 11. Students may be admitted to candidacy after they have completed 24 hours of course work and satisfied at least three of the area test requirements either by pas sing the relevant tests or by fulfilling the necessary course work as out lined in item 3. 12.

Ruden, Associate Professor (Environmental Health Sciences); Environmental Toxicology, Drosophila G e- netics and Develo pmental Biology Program Inf ormation Environmental health scientists work for industry, go v- ernment, and academia to estimate and mitigate environmental exposures to chemical, biological, and physical stressors. The department is committed to education and research in the iden- tification, evaluation, and control of these human health ha- zards. The Ph.D. program in env ironmental health sciences focuses on the toxicology, toxicogenomics, and proteomics of gene -environment intera ctions. The Ph.D. degree is designed to prepare scientists for careers in environmental health r e- search. Interactions between enviro nmental agents and the functions of tissues and cells are the focus of this department. Taking a dvantage of the rapid developments in genetics and signal transduction in combination with the traditional areas of environmental health sciences, the department is devel oping new approaches to environmental toxicology and occupational health. Graduates are qualified to assume u pper-level positions in the public or private sector in management, teaching, r e- search, or consulting. Graduates are particularly qualified for teaching or research positions in academic institutions that require sound r esearch training. Specific research interests of faculty in the department i n- clude effects of chemicals and environmental oxidants on DNA and proteins, the effects of environmental toxins on d e- velopmental processes using Drosophila as a model, risk as- sessment, biological methods for treating ha zardous wastes, and biological monitoring tools for assessing ch emical exp o- sures. Admission Applicants should have a bachelor's or higher degree in one of the natural sciences from an accredited college or un i- versity. This should include a minimum of a one -year s e- quence in biology, organic, inorganic, and physical chem istry; and a one -year physics sequence requiring calculus. Appl i- cants are required to take the GRE Ge neral Test. A score of 550 on each of the verbal, quantitative, and analytical sections of the examination is required, as well as a GPA of 3.0. Dead-line f or applications to be admi tted into the program is May 1. Curriculum Ph.D. students are expected to complete the department core course requirements as well as those courses necessary to prepare them to conduct their dissertation research. The r e- quired co re courses include Integrative Biomedical Sc iences (IBS) 701 and 702 the first year, an advanced, computer -based statistics course, ENH 764 (Signal Transduction in Enviro n- mental Health and Toxicology), and either EPI 616 (Enviro n- mental Epidemiology) or EPI 617 (Occupational Epidemio lo- gy) the second year. Other courses pr eparatory to dissertation research will be determined by the student in consultation with his or her academic advisors..

Signal Transduction in Environmental Health and Toxicology. One of the major challenges in enviro nmen- tal health is determination of the underlying mechanisms through whi ch toxicants act. Many of the adverse effects of toxicants are mediated through interaction with the processes whereby tissues and cells comm unicate with each other or respond to external stimuli. Some toxicants may interfere with normal signaling while ot hers may mimic endogenous stim u- lants and mediators. Another major mechanism for the action of toxicants is the stimulation of inflammatory processes (Forman). 791. Advanced Toxicology Seminar .

Program Information The Graduate Training Program in Forensic Science is a university -wide graduate training program in the context of a traditional Ph.D. program for students who wish to obtain pr o- fessional training in forensic science. Students will take fore n- sic science courses and courses required by one of the four Ph.D. granting departments (Biology, Chemistry, Molecular Cell Biology/Microbiology, or Pharmacology and Toxicol o- gy), followed by dissertation research on a topic related to forensic science and mentored by a faculty member affiliated with one of these four departments through a primary or se c- ondary (a djunct) appointment. Forensic science involves the application of knowledge gained from a multitude of scientific disciplines to t he needs of both civil and criminal justice. Since modern legal proceed- ings frequently include expert testimony utilizing knowledge and technologies from the physical and biological sc iences, the discipline has emerged as an important component of jud i- cial proceedings. The use of scientific technology in court has reached such a degree of sophistica tion that merely applying the knowledge and technologies derived from research and development in conventional physical and biological science specializations is no longer adequate. Doc toral- level training and research skills specific to the requir ements of evidentiary rules and proceedings are necessary for the identification and solution of many issues that arise in contemporary court se t- tings. Admission Procedu res Students who are interested in Forensic Science Doctoral Training Program must apply for a dmission through the Gra d- uate School. A steering committee will then make a re com- mendation to the Graduate School whether an individual a p- plicant should be admitted to the Forensic Science Doctoral Training Program. A decision is made based on the majority vote of members in the committee. All application materials should be received by the Grad- uate School by the end of January. Applications co mpleted after this d ate may not be considered if vacancy is no longer available. Curriculum and Funding All students are required to take a total of 8 hours of f o- rensic science (FS) courses during the first three terms of at-tendance. The Department of Justice Sciences o ffers these courses. St udents are also required to take a set of core courses, followed by the completion of a set of other courses required by the Ph.D. granting program selected by the st u- dents. Students are strongly urged to select their Ph.D. granting depar tments and from their advisors by the end of the se cond and the third terms, respectively. (Students who have not s e- lected advisors by the end of the third term will not be permi t- ted to continue in the program.) Students' study plans will then be guided by their advisors and graduate study commi ttees. With the exceptions of admissions and course requir e- ments, students are required to complete the same requir e- ments and protocols (such as teaching, seminar, r esearch tool, preliminary examination, qualifying e xamination, research proposal, dissertation, and dissertation defense) established in their selected Ph.D. granting d epartments. The Department of Justice Sciences will fund students during their first year of participation. Participating Ph.D. pr o- grams or the student advisors will begin funding selected stu- dents at the fourth term and continue funding until the compl e- tion of doctoral course work and dissertation research, gene r- ally for four years.

Since that time, the program has expanded considerably and offers di-verse academic opportunities. Students have access to a nu m- ber of faculty members fro m mult iple disciplines who bring research and aca demic expertise to the study of aging and the aged. The Gerontology Education Program offers multidiscipl i- nary academic courses in gerontology leading to a graduate certificate. The study of gerontology at t hese levels is d e- signed to provide people educated in various disciplines with the back ground needed to work in programs related to aging and the aged. The main goals are to provide students with a thorough background in existing theory and research in ger on- tology, and a supplement to their existing backgrounds and profe ssional disciplines. We have designed the program to prepare students for leadership roles in this field of growing importance for both the private and public sectors. Our pr o- gram's curric ulum integrates research, theory, and practice. Its multidisciplinary approach reflects the u rban mission of UAB. The program office is located at the UAB Center for A g- ing. This academic program is administered by the Director of -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 126 the Gerontology Educ ation Pr ogram, who also serves as Chair of the Guidance Committee on Graduate and Undergraduate Education in Gerontology. This committee is made up of re p- resentatives of academic depar tments and schools throughout the UAB campus active in the study of aging and the aged. The multidisciplinary ge rontology program is offered to all UAB students in good standing with the sponsorship and sup-port of the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the School of Health Related Professions, and the Center for A g- ing. Student Admissions and Advise ment Although general advisement is handled through UAB student advising and parent departments, student advis ement in gerontology is handled formally by the Director of the Ge r- ontology Education Program. The director facilitates stude nt advisement with other members of the Committee on Grad u- ate and Undergraduate Education in Ger ontology. A graduate specialty is offered to students who want a special emphasis in gerontology or geriatrics. The major o b- jective of this specialization is to provide a strong academic background for professional careers in academic and aging - related settings. There are two avenues for undertaking the graduate gerontology certificate requir ements. Students in good standing in the graduate school can specialize in gero n- tology through their primary department. Letters of applic a- tion also are accepted from students who have already co m- pleted requirements for an ad vanced or professional degree. Students not currently enrolled in a graduate program at UAB may petitio n the university for nondegree admi ssion status. Once accepted, the student can undertake a course of study to receive a graduate certificate upon co mpletion of the required sequence of classes. A careful review of proposed curriculum is recommended before the student enrolls for gero ntology study. This will give students an opportunity to receive initial advisement while reviewing available study plans and course sche dules. Requirements Students must complete at least 15 credit hours of grad u- ate-level work in gerontology or geria trics, achieving a grade of B or better in each course. The curriculum consists of a required multidisciplinary course offered through the graduate school (GRD 600, see Graduate School listing), three gero n- tology electives chosen fr om a roster of courses approved by the Committee on Graduate and Undergraduate Education in Gerontology, and a required research project or a relevant i n- ternship. To ensure a mul tidisciplinary perspective, courses must represent at least two departments. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Patricia S.

The maximum size of each entering class should be approx imately 25 to 30 students. However, because most students in the HI program are part -time, it is anticipated that the program enrollment may be larger. The program begins in the fall term. Application to the program may be made in September through April 30, prece d- ing the expected date of enrollment for the next fall term. A p- plications received after April 30 are considered on a space-available basis.

Integrative Biomedical Sciences Pr ogram (Ph.D. in participating depar tments) Graduate program director: Kirk Faculty from Participating Departments Sciences Program Information The Integrative Biomedical Sciences Program, offered through the Departments of Genomics and Pathobiology, P a- thology, Physiology, and Pharmacology and Tox icology, and Environmental Health Sciences, consists of course work and individual laboratory research leading to the Ph.D. degree. The program is designed to pr ovide interdisciplinary training of high quality in cellular and molecular biology, and organ - based pathophysiology, to a selected group of predoctoral st u- dents, preparing them to become independent investigators in these disciplines. Students are immersed in research at the forefront of sc ientific endeavor and provided with sufficient guidance and course work to place their research in the proper perspective. The first -year curriculum emphasizes three areas: acquis i- tion of a working knowledge of contemporary ce llular and molecular biology, an integrated approach toward understan d- ing the principals of physiology pathophysiology and disease therapy, and the role of genetics and genetic models of disease in basic biology. Involvement in laboratory training through research rotations, and the acquisition of skills in reading, writing, and speaking are also emphasized. Advanced st udents are engaged primar ily in research but also take some advanced courses and tutorials in specialized areas of interest and par tic- ipate in sem inars. Completion of requirements for the Ph.D. usually takes five years. No foreign language is required. Graduates typically go on to postdoctoral research ap- pointments followed by careers in academic research and teach ing or research in the biote chnology industry. Facilities and Resources Faculty members participating in the program have more than 100,000 square feet of laboratory space. In addition to well-equipped labs, a number of special facilities are avai la- ble, including several multiprobe NMR spectrometers (ran ging in frequency up to 400 MHz), advanced confocal micr oscopic equipment, state of the art mass spectrometry facilities, ele c- tron microscopes, protein and nucleic acid synthesis and anal- cilities, equipment, a co mputer facilities, and a hybridoma faci lity. How to Apply Admission decision is based on scores achieved on the Grad uate Records Examinations (a combined score of 1200, nominally, on the verbal and quantitative portions of the Ge n- eral Test), undergraduate GPA, letters of evaluation and, whenever possible, a personal interview with members of the Admissions Committee. There is no applic ation deadline, but all applications r eceived will be reviewed by March 1, 2002. To be accepted into the program, the student should have completed a B.S. degree that includes the following under gra--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 136 duate course work by the time of entrance: calculus (int egral and differential), general and organic chemistry , and at least one i ntroductory course in zoology or biology. Courses in physical chemistry, genetics, and cell biology are also to the benefit of the candidate. Any remedial course work must be completed with a grade of B or better before the end of the first full year of do ctoral study.

On acceptance into the program, the student will be affiliated with a \"host\" department. Assis- tantships can be awarded either by the host department or by the materials science program. U ntil a student has chosen a mentor, the Materials Scienc e graduate program direc tor, or his or her designate, will advise the student. Course Work Students enter this program with diverse undergraduate training in engineering, physical, or biological sciences. The multidisciplinary curriculum has been structure d to develop a common philosophy of the interrelationship of structure, pro p- erties, and synthesis of materials. The program committee can waive some course work for a student entering the program with a master's degree in an appropr iate discipline. During the first phase of instruction (usually 12 semester hours), the student is expected to acquire a core of know ledge -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 138 in materials science through formal course work and ind epen- dent study. The core is divided into four topical areas: (1) structure and analysi s; (2) condensed matter science; (3) ther- modynamics and kinetics; and (4) structure, processing, and properties. Each student's background will be evaluated in order to develop an indi vidual program of study, which may involve some undergraduate course wor k to satisfy prerequ i- sites for graduate courses and to provide sufficient breadth of coverage of the core areas. To co mplete this phase, the student must pass all sections of Program Examination I; the four parts of this examination are offered twice per y ear. The st u- dent is expected to choose a mentor before completion of Pr o- gram Examina tion I. The second (specialization, normally 24 semester hours) and the third (electives, 12 semester hours) phases of the cu r- riculum are planned by the student and the r esearch adviser, with approval of the student's graduate study committee. Available areas of specialization are (1) structure and prope r- ties of materials; (2) macromolecular materials; (3) electronic, optical, and magnetic materials; (4) materials processing ; (5) biomaterials or (6) mechanical behavior of mat erials. Courses may be taken at UAB, the University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa), or the University of Al abama in Huntsville. Near the end of the formal course work, the st udent must pass a comprehensive exami nation (Program Examination II) set by the student's graduate committee and present a dissertation proposal. Foreign Language Requirement Each student is required to demonstrate reading prof icien- cy in a foreign language or proficiency in a technique or ski ll that is a useful adjunct to the research degree. In the case of a foreign language, competency will be established by an ex- amination that consists of the student translating (with dic tio- nary) a r esearch article, chosen by the student's graduate study committee. A pass/fail determination will be made by the st u- dent's graduate study committee after receiving an a ssessment of merit from a foreign language professor. The la nguage ch o- sen may not be the native tongue of the student and must be from the follo wing list: Chinese, French, German, Japanese, or Russian. A particular research technique or skill must be a p- proved by the student's graduate study co mmittee. Program Completion Since the Ph.D. is a research degree, all students are ex- pected to acquire most of their advanced knowledge through research training. These activities will be directly supervised by the student's mentor. The student will write a dissertation and defend it by oral ex amination.

However, these have never been strictly sep a- rated. The Ph.D. program in applied mathemat ics stresses the interconnection between pure mathematics and its diverse applic ations. Admission Only students with a firm foundation in advanced calc u- lus, algebra, and topology are considered for immediate a d- mission to the Ph.D. program. A student lacking this bac k- ground will be considered for admission to the M. S. program. Upon passing the qualifying examination, a student may trans-fer to the Ph.D. program. We expect at least a B average in a student's previous work and a score above 550 on each section of the Graduate Record Examination Ge neral Test. Program of Study Each student in the Ph.D. program has to take the follo w- ing steps: Passing the Joint Program Exam (JPE), also called the Qualifying Exam. This is an exam in real analysis and a p- plied linear algebra. It is administered by the Joint Pr o- gram Committee, which includes graduate faculty from all three participating universities. A student that is admit- ted directly into the Ph.D. pr ogram is expected to take this exam by the end of the first year at the latest. This exam i- nation may be taken no more than twic e. Completing 54 semester hours of graduate courses. The grade of each course has to be at least a B. The student's supervisory committee and the Joint Program Commi ttee must approve the selection of courses. At least 18 hours must be in a major area of concentration, selected so that the student will be prepared to conduct r esearch in an area of applied math ematics, while at least 12 hours have to be in a minor area of study, which is a subject outside m a- thematics. Passing a language or tool of research exam. Passing the Comprehensive Exam, which consists of a written part and an oral part. Preparing a dissertation, which must be a genuine contr i- bution to mathematics. Passing the Final Examination (thesis d efense).

The CMB program involves student recruitment, admissions, and the first -year curric ulum. At the end of the first year, each CMB student chooses a mentor and elects to pursue a degree in biochemistry and molecular genetics, cell biology, microb i- ology or neurobiology. The Microbiology graduate progra m has as its primary objective to provide high quality, multidisciplinary train ing leading to the Ph.D. degree. Trainees who complete this pr o- gram are expected to make significant future contrib utions in research in the basic biomedical sciences and to teach future generations of competent and productive r esearch scientists. The program consists of a core curriculum that emph asiz- es (a) the multidisciplinary and quantitative aspects of modern biomedical sciences; (b) a diversity of laboratory r esearch traini ng experiences; and (c) the development of skills in rea d- ing, writing, and speaking. Advanced st udents take courses and tutorials in specialized areas of interest, partici pate in s e- minars, and have opportunities to gain teaching e xperience while satisfying other requirements for their doctoral pr o- grams. Areas of specialization for Ph.D. dissertation research i n- clude prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular biology; molec cell cellular, deve lopmental, and tumor imm u- and structure of biological macromole- cules and membranes; and host -parasite relationships, path o- genesis, and infectious di sease. Administration of Graduate Program The Microbiology graduate program is administ ered by a graduate committee, chaired by the Microbiology grad uate program director. The committee consists of six faculty me m- bers representing different scientific subdisciplines of micr o- biology. Admission Requirements and Fina ncial Aid The CMB admission s committee considers applications for admission to the Ph.D. program from prospective graduate students who present evidence of superior scholarship and who have completed courses in general and organic chemistry; mathematics, and at least one in troductor y course in zoology or biology. Completion of courses in physical chemistry and biology, including genetics and biochemistry, is also reco m- mended. Students with M.S., M.D., D.D.S., D.M.D., and D.V.M. degrees are encouraged to apply. Admission criteria for the Ph.D. program are those of the Graduate School, plus a personal interview. Students ac cepted into the program during the last several years have had ave r- age scores of greater than 600 on the quantitative portion of the GRE General Test and 1,200 on the combined verbal and quantitative sections. All students accepted into the program are provided with fellowships or traineeships. Fellows and trainees are required to under take full -time studies and are not permitted to do any other remunerative work. Fina ncial su p- port will be continued provided the student's performance is satisfactory. During the 2002 -2003 ac ademic year, entering students were provided with stipends of $18,156 per annum plus funds for tuition, fees, and health i nsurance. These amounts are reviewed yearly.

Michael Wyss , Professor, Cell Biology Program Information Objectives The mission of the Neurobiology Graduate Program is to train a new generation of neuroscienti sts to become leading contributors to basic and health -related brain research. St u- dents receive a breadth of knowledge of the fundamentals of modern neurobiological research, including molecular and integrative systems approaches. Trai ning also includes in depth research in a specific area, with topics ranging from the molecular and cellular basis of normal structure and function of the nervous system to disease mechanisms and treatment. In addition to interfacing with other basic science departments at UAB , students have the opportunity to receive training in cli n- ical topics from Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry, Pedia-trics, and Rehabilitation Medicine. The Neurobiology Grad u- ate Program provides a firm foundation for fundame ntal ne u- roscience research and teaching careers at academic health science centers. Admission Requirements Students may enter the Neurobiology Graduate Program through a feeder program such as the Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB) program, the Neuroscience program, or the M.D. -Ph.D. program. In addition, direct applic ations to the Neurobiology Graduate Program will be considered by the Neurobiology Admissions Commi ttee. Recommendations for acceptance of direct applications will be based on Graduate School admissions criteria and, whe n possible, a personal i n- terview. Overview of the Program During the first year, students take a series of core courses that are defined by the program through which they enter. In addition, each student obtains research experience and ident i- fies potential mentors through three laboratory rotations. At the end of the first year, students choose a mentor and labor a- tory for their dissertation r esearch. In the second year, students conduct research and participate in two Topics in Neurobio lo- gy courses which ar e based on broadening and reinforcing an understand ing of fundamental concepts in neurobiology. The Topics courses also serve as the departmental qualifying e x- am. At the end of the second year, a graduate disser tation committee is chosen by the student. In the third year, a formal written proposal of the student's dissertation project is pr e- sented to and evaluated by the student's graduate dissertation committee . Once the core and Topics courses have been co m- pleted and the dissertation proposal is approved, the st udent is admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in Neurobiology. In the third and fourth years, students perform dissertation research and may choose to take an ad vanced graduate course. Neurobiology students participate in the Neurobiology Sem i- nar Series and a jou rnal club colloquium throughout their graduate studies. Coursework First Year All Neurobiology students are required to take a set of courses during the first year of the graduate program that provide a fundamental unde rstanding in bio chemistry, cell biology, genetics, and cellular physiol ogy. For M.D. -Ph.D. students, this course curriculum is a two -year program. First year courses are determined by the pr ogram through which the student enters and include a selection from the following: CMB Core (Biomolecules Genes, and Cells), Cell Signaling, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, Integrative Neuro s- cience, Developmental cience. The Neurobiology D epartment requires all students to achieve grades of B or high er in all courses. Second Year The centerpiece of the second -year is a s e- quence of two Topics in Neurob iology courses which are ta k- en during the fall and winter. Four areas are e mphasized in the Topics modules: concepts in neuroscience, literature evalu a- tion, oral presentation, and writing skills. After succes sfully completing the two Topics courses, the student has qual ified in the Department and is ready to prepare for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. An elective course must be taken du r- ing the spring of the second year. This course is selected from a list of approved Ne urobiology, Neuroscience, CMB, or Med- ical School courses. Students must also take Principles of Scientific Integrity and an approved course in statistics, such as Statistics for Biomedical Sci ences/Biometry. These are usually taken during the second or third year. Third and Fourth Years In the third and fourth years, students are encouraged, but not required, to take pert inent advanced courses in Neurobiology. Offerings of the Depar t- ment include Biophysics of Membrane Excitability, Mech an- isms of Signal Transduction, Mind and Brain, Neurobio logy of Disease, and Principles of Synaptic Transmission and Plas- ticity. Advanced courses may also be selected from offer ings of other departments. Admission to Candidacy After successfully completing the first year core and To p- ics courses, students are required to write and give an oral prese ntation of their dissertation proposal in the summer or fall of the third year. The dissertation proposal is si milar in organization to an NIH NRSA style grant application. For acceptance of the proposal by the disser tation committee, the student must describe a significant and original scientific problem, formulate a testable hypoth esis, write a clear and concise experimental design that addresses the problem, di s- cuss her or his ideas orally in an effective manner, and demo n- strate comprehension of the pro blem in a broad and critical context. Completion of the Ph.D. Program After being admitted to candidacy, the st udent meets at least once a year with the dissertation committee. It is e x- pected that most students will complete the entire program in four or five years. However, in extenuating ci rcumstances, up -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 150 to seven years is allowed for completion of the Ph.D degree. To further develop presentation and teaching skills, students give research seminars in the Neurobiology Student/Fellow Seminar Series and at Neurob iology Retreat. Students also participate in a teach ing practicum that can take the form of didactic lect ures, running a journal club, or assisting in a lab course or discu ssion group. Financial Assistance Doctoral students will receive financial aid in the form of a fellowship. Current stipends are $18,156 per year plus tu i- tion for 2002 entering students, contingent upon availability of funds. Doctoral students are considered full time; therefore, no work or other activity unrelated to pursuit of the doctoral de-gree is permitted.

Faculty mentors from more than twelve basic and clini- cal departments participate in this program. The current r e- search of these faculty include molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, immunological, developmental, ne urological, g e- netic, and psychia tric approaches to the nervous system. With more than sixty participating faculty, students enrolled in the neuroscience graduate program have numerous potential r e- search lab oratories in which to pursue their doctoral training. The neuroscience graduate program administers an inte n- sive, year -long core curriculum designed to provide entering graduate students with a comprehensive introduction to Ne u- roscience. The core curriculum includes Biochemistry, Cell u- lar and Molecular Neurobiology, Developmental Neuros-cience, and Integrative Neuroscience. Students are exposed to ongoing research projects as they rotate through three diffe rent labor atories during their first nine months of residency. In addition, a highly recommended, 2\u00bd w eek residential course- Introduction to Neurobiology -is offered at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab oratory for incoming Neuroscience students. For more details, see www.disl.org/location.html and univ - prog.disl.org/spdescription.html Students enter the neuroscience graduate program with the intent of using their classroom and laboratory exper iences during the first year to help them further define their research interests. The minimum admission cr iteria are those of the Graduate School (B -level scholarship and a combined score of at least 550 on each section of the GRE) and a suitable bac k- ground in the bi ological and physical sciences. Students for whom English is a second language are also required to take the TOEFL examina tion. At the beginning of their second year in graduate school, Neuroscience students who successfully compete the neuroscience core cu rriculum select an advisor and become affiliated with a depar tmental graduate program. Advanced courses in Neuroscience are offered by ind i- vidual departments, and seminar series bring outstanding ne u- roscientists to the UAB campus. Since large numbers of ne u- roscientists are actively involved in research o n the campus, a variety of journal clubs and special -interest dis cussion groups meet weekly. All students conduct their dissertation research and their initial laboratory rotations in the laboratories of the various faculty members in the program. The outs tanding facilities for neuroscience research at UAB include state- of-the-art equi p- ment in the laboratories of the faculty members, and unique shared resources such as high -resolution microscopic imaging and high -field MRI sy stems. Perhaps the greatest strength of graduate training in neuroscience at UAB is the willingness of the faculty to allow students to gain a wide range of expertise and thus greatly facilitate the students' investigation of ne u-roscience questions of interest to them. The program is d e- signed to recruit and train individuals who will become future leaders in neuroscience research. The program antic ipates a d- mitting 6 -12 students each year.

The program is administered by a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty: Drs. J.L. Mes-sina, D. Elga- vish, X. Cao, D. Kucik, and J. Douglas. Students demonstrating superior schol arship who desire careers in academic and investigative pathology are encou r- aged to apply. Acceptance of students is based on Graduate School admission criteria, letters of recommendation, asses s- ment of motivation, and a personal interview by the Pathology Grad uate Committee. Admission is open to highly motivated students with strong backgrounds in the biological sciences. It is reco m- mended that students with B.Sc. degrees have completed u n- dergraduate courses in physics, calculus, chemistry, organic chemist ry, bio logy, or zoology and at least one advanced course in areas such as comparative anat omy, embryology, genetics, histology, or physiology. Applicants who hold M.D., D.V.M., D.M.D., or equivalent degrees are also encou raged to apply. The objective of th e program is to train individuals for academic and investigative careers in di sease mechanisms and processes. A combination of didactic and laboratory exp e- rience will be provided to achieve the following specific goals for each student: (1) understanding of basic disease mech an- isms, (2) appreciation of modern techniques in cellular and molecular biology, (3) integration of molecular mechanisms of disease with pathophysiology, (4) application of the sc ientific method to prob lems in disease mechanisms through discerning experimentation, and (5) effective communication of inform a- tion through teaching and writing skills. Although the program is designed to acquaint the student with all major facets of experimental pathology and genomic research, specialization i s encouraged. At pr esent, students may choose to concentrate their efforts in any of the following areas: cardiovascular biology, immunopathol ogy, oncology, comparative pathophysiology, metabolic and bone diseases, genetics of disease, nanimal models of di sease, nutr itional pathology, oral pathology, and pathology of various organ systems. Ph.D. Program This degree is granted on the basis of scholarly prof icien- cy, distinctive achievement, and original research. Add itional course requirements are not rigidl y fixed but are planned to meet the needs and interests of individual students. All st u- dents are ex pected to gain competence in cognate fields (e.g., scientific method, computer appl ications, cellular and molec u- lar biology) and become independent investiga tors in exper i- mental pathology. Students are given opportunities to study modern tech niques of teaching and to participate in teaching under the supervision of e xperienced instructors. Preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation is the final requ ire- ment for award of this degree. The core curricu lum includes Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBS 700, 701, 702) and Graduate Patho logy (PAT 700, 701). Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Joseph L.

Admission Admission into the physics graduate program is by re c- ommendation of the graduate admission committee of the D e- partment of Physics. The committee takes into consideration GRE General Test scores, prior academic performance, and the letters of evaluation, usually from former instru ctors. For international students, a TOEFL score of 570 is required for admission. Beginning the Program All students must take an oral placement examination on basic physics concepts before register ing for any courses. Upon arrival at UAB, international students will be required to take an English as a Second Language course or Scientific Communica tion courses at UAB during their first year of study until a score equivalent to 570 on the TOEFL is achieved. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 174 M.S. Program Plan I The student must successfully complete at least 30 sem e- ster hours of coursework, including at least four core courses selected from PH 610- 611, 650- 651, and 671- 672 and 6 s eme- ster hours of Thesis Research (PH 699). The student must also write and complete a successful oral defense of a thesis under the direction of a graduate faculty member. Additional coursework should be selec ted with the advice of the st udent's graduate study committee to meet the particular needs of the student. An interdisciplinary track for an M.S. degree Plan I is also offered. Students admitted to this track will typically hold a bach elor's degree in a s cience area other than physics, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, or ps y- chology, or an engineering degree, including optics and mat e- rials science. Thesis research will be in an interdisciplinary area, including astrophysics, astr obiology, biophysics, chem i- cal physics, geophysics, mathematical physics, neur ophysics, optics, materials science, or engineering physics. Students awarded an M.S. degree within this track will be prepared for an Assistant Research Physicist position, incl uding qualific a- tion for coauthorship, and would typically work under the d i- rection of a doc toral- level person. The acquired skill would be highly marketable, as individuals trained in multi disciplinary areas for basic and applied research are increasingly in de-mand in industry, government laborat ories, and other research institutions. Acceptance into this interdisciplinary track will be through a Physics Graduate Faculty member, who will be pr e- pared to s upervise the student's thesis research and develop a plan of study. This plan of study will include a core of courses (Classical Mechanics, PH 561 -562; Electromagnetic Th eory, PH 545- 546; and Quantum M echanics, PH 550 -551), other physics graduate- level courses, and a minimum of 12 hours of graduate -level cour ses offered by other departments. The D e- partment of Physics will establish a standing Physics Interdi s- ciplinary Track Committee to review and concur in each st u- dent's plan of study. As is current practice, thesis oversight will be by the student's M.S. Graduate Study Committee. Plan II With approval of the physics graduate program director, a nonthesis option (Plan II) is available; in this case, the grad u- ate study committee requires an additional 6 semester hours of cours ework instead of a thesis and give s the student an M.S. - degree exit examination. Ph.D. Program All students are required to pass an oral and written quali- fying examination covering the areas of classical mechanics, electromagnetic theory, quantum physics, and one selected topic from thermo dynamics/statistical mechanics, optics, or solid -state physics. This examination is to be taken within two terms of completing six core courses, PH 710 -711, 750 - 751, and 771- 772. Under no circumstances may the exam ination be taken more than twice. Followi ng satisfactory completion of the qualifying ex- amin ation and consultation with individual faculty members, the student selects a specific area for dissertation research u n- der the supervision of an appropriate graduate faculty member. The student's Graduate Study Committee, chaired by the m a- jor advisor, will outline a program of study including at least four graduate courses and appropriate tools of research, such as computer and/or foreign language comp etency. After the student completes these specializatio n courses and tools of research, the Graduate Study Committee will administer an oral examin ation to test the student's knowledge in the area of research. The student must pass this oral examin ation in no more than two attempts. Then, with direction from t he major advisor, the student should focus on formulating and writing a formal research proposal that must be presented and defended before the Graduate Study Commi ttee; this should lead to a recommendation from the committee for admission to cand i- dacy. Di ssertation research culminates in the successful oral defense of the dissert ation. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Yogesh K.

Admission Requirements Applications to the program will be judged by the gradu- ate committee of the Department of Physiology and Biophy s- ics, in consultation with other appropriate fa culty. Acceptance recommendat ions will be based on Graduate School admission criteria and, when possible, a personal interview with me m- bers of the graduate commi ttee. Selection of Faculty Advisor and Area of R esearch Upon admission to the graduate program, each student will be assign ed a temporary graduate committee until a field of research is selected. During the first year, students will pe r- form at least three (3) laboratory rotations. Each rotation must be approved by the graduate program director. Students are encouraged to perfo rm laboratory rotations with primary and secondary faculty members in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. In the event that a student identifies a faculty member outside of the Department of Physiology and Bi o-physics with whom he/she would like to rotate, the student must bring this matter to the attention of the graduate pr ogram director. The student must state clearly to the Director why he/she has made such a choice. The Director will then present the matter to the Physiology and Biophysics Grad uate Co m- mittee for review and approval. The length of each of these rotations can vary, but they must last at least eight weeks. By the end of the first year, the student is expected to have s e- lected an area of research and a permanent advisor from the Physiology and Biophysics faculty roster. It is hoped that I n- ternational students select a per manent mentor when applying for admission. During the second year, the student should a s- semble his/her thesis commi ttee. The committee will consist of a minimum of five faculty members to include three phys i- ology faculty and two external faculty (at least one external member should be neither a primary nor secondary Physio logy & Biophysics faculty appointment); the departmental chair and graduate program director are ex-officio me mbers of all graduate thesis committees. The student's committee is r e- quired to meet formally with the student every 9 -12 months, and submit a written report summarizing the deliberations of that meeting to the Director of Graduate Students wi th a copy to the student. After 4 years in the program, the Committee will meet every 6 months until the Ph.D. disse rtation work is completed. Financial Assistance Doctoral students will receive financial aid in the form of a fellowship. Current stipends are $18,156 per year plus tu i- tion, fees and insurance. Ph.D. Program Requirements Courses All students are required to take IBS 700, 701, 702, PHY 750 (Molecular Physiology and Medicine), and PHY 704 (Biometry). Each student is also required to take three reading courses (PHY 790, 791, 792) and PHY 796 (Seminars in Phy-siology). PHY 796 must be taken by all students throug hout their graduate studies. All 1st year students must sfully complete GRD substitutions must be approved by the pr ogram d i- rector and/or department chair. The graduate school reg ularly offers one -day workshops and short courses in scientific wri t- ing, communication skills, and sc ientific ethics that our grad u- ate students are en couraged to attend. Full -time students are required to regi ster for 15 hours per semester for fall and spring; 10 hours for summer semester. Grades At the completion of a course, students are normally a s- signed a Letter Grade. Students must maintain a \"B\" average. If a student receives one \"C\" grade or lower, the student will be placed on academic probation. In general, it takes two semesters to clear probation. If a student receives two \"C\" grades or lower in r equired courses, the student is subject to dism issal from the program pending an appeal to the Physiol- ogy and Biophysics Graduate Committee. Departmental Seminars As required for PHY 796, all graduate students must a t- tend and participate in the department seminar series every seme ster that they are enr olled. Following each seminar, the graduate students meet with the seminar speaker over lunch. Attendance is mandatory. As the seminar program is pu blished well in advance, students should ensure that they are available -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 178 for this 2 -hour period. The faculty consider the seminar series as one of the more important and essential enrichment activ i- ties for the grad uate students. Teaching Requirements An important aim of the physiology and biophysics gra d- uate program is to provide students with teaching exper ience. All students in Physiology and Biophysics are expected to participate in the reading courses (PHY 790 -792) and teac hing programs of the Department of Physiol ogy and Biophysics Grievances Although rare, disagreements can arise that may affect a student's progress toward the completion of the degree. The parties involved in such a dispute should make a good faith effort to discuss and resolve the disagreement. Guidelines r e- garding the handling of grievances as well as arbitration for the graduate program in physiology and biophysics are avai la- ble on our web site at grad -program.physiology.uab.edu . If, for any reason, you have concerns or a grievance about the program, please contact D. Lisa Schwiebert or Dale Benos directly. Admission to Candidacy Following completion of required courses, each student must take a qualifying exam subject to review by the student's thesis committee. This qualifying exam should be completed during the student's third ye ar. Specifically, this exam will entail a written thesis proposal and an oral defense of this pr o- posal. Throughout the organiz ation of the thesis proposal - qualifying exam, the amount of dire ction the student receives is at the discretion of the mentor and the thesis committee members. The thesis pr oposal should be 10- pages in length and written in an NRSA -style format (i.e. Abstract, Specific Aims, Background and Si gnificance, Preliminary Data, and Research D esign). A draft of the proposal should then be handed out to each committee member, the student may then schedule the oral defense of the proposal before the depar t- ment; it is anticipated that approval of the written proposal by the committee members will occur within a month of having received the propo sal. Follo wing the oral defense of the thesis proposal, the committee may recommend corrections to the written proposal within a month of the defense. Upon succes s- ful completion of both the written pr oposal and oral defense, the student may apply for candi dacy. It is reco mmended that no more than 2 months lapse between initial submission of the written proposal to the committee and application for cand ida- cy; if more than two months elapses, the student may have to re-defend the proposal. Upon entering candi dacy, each student must enroll in PHY 799 (Doctoral Level Dissertation Research). Compl etion of 30 credit hours (i.e., 2 semesters @ 15 hours each) of PHY 799 is required prior to the thesis defense. Ph.D. Program Completion Once the mentor, student, and t hesis committee agree that the student has completed his/her th esis work, the student may begin to prepare for the thesis defense. In prep aration for and completion of the defense, the following steps must be taken: The student must 'apply for the degree'. This entails completing the necessary paperwork (See Ms. Charlae Starr, MCLM 966, 934- 3969), which requires signatures from the student's mentor and the graduate program d i- rector. After the student has applied for the degree, he/she will receive the follo wing items from the UAB Graduate School: thesis formatting instructions, typed signature forms (see Julie Bryant -HUC 511), microfiche form, and graduate student survey. For any questions regarding fo r- matting, the student should contact Mr. Lee Griner at th e Graduate School (HUC 511, 975- 6511). Upon receipt of the typed signature forms, the student should bring these forms to the graduate program director's office for saf e- keeping until the defense. The student should complete the microfiche form and survey a t his/her conve nience. Once the thesis is complete, copies of the thesis must be distributed to each thesis committee member as well as to Dr. Benos and the graduate program director. All copies must be distributed AT LEAST TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE ORAL DE FENSE. To schedule the oral defense of the thesis, the student must contact Ms. Starr (934 -3969). She will need the title of the thesis, the date and time agreed upon by the mentor and thesis committee, and the location of the defense. It is the responsibility of the student to reserve a site for the defense and a location to meet with the committee after the defense. Upon successful defense of the thesis, the student must turn in a final, corrected draft to the UAB Graduate School with 10 business days follo wing the oral d efense. Since the Graduate School may require formatting changes to the thesis after the final draft has been submi t- ted, it is strongly suggested that the student remain at UAB at least two add itional weeks to complete these changes. Before the student leaves the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, the student must leave a forwarding a d- dress with the graduate program director's office Additional Information For detailed information contact Dr. Lisa Schwiebert, Grad uate Program Director, UAB Department of Physiology and Bi ophysics, McCallum Building, Room 966, 1530 3rd Ave South, 0005.

A terminal master's degree is not o f- fered. The Medical/Clinical Psychology Specialization is ap-proved by the American Psychological Associ ation. Behavioral Neuroscience Study in the Behavioral Neuroscience specialization is designed to prepare students for independent research and teaching in the neurobiology of behavior. Research training is provided by faculty in the Department of Psychology and in the UAB Schools of Medicine and Optometry, who share an interest in the biological basis of b ehavior. The cou rse of study includes a core curriculum in neuroscience and recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Students o btain strong backgrounds in b ehavioral science and in neuroscience and UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 181 gain expertise in the content and techniques of selected areas of ne uroscience as they apply to the study of behavior. Faculty laboratories are equipped for research in behavior, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, neur o- chemistry, and molecular biology. The r esearch interests of the faculty include ne uroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system; psychophysics; intera ctions between the central nervous system and the periphery in the control of feeding and energy balance; neurophysiology of motor systems and movement disorders; chemical senses; ne urochemical and immunological approaches to the study of acetylcholine recep- tors in brain and muscle; models of memory d e- velopment precursors of nerve -target interactions; neur o- phys iology of pain. Cognitive Science Study in the Cognitive Science program at UAB is d e- signed to prepare students for independent research and teach- ing in the interdisciplinary domain of cognitive science. While the program is administered in the Depar tment of Psychology it draws on faculty from Biomedical Engineering, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology as well as on departments in the University Medical Center such as Neurobiology, Physiolog i- cal Optics, and Radio logy. The diversity of research programs represented by par tic- ipating faculty greatly enhances the training in cognitive science at UAB. From philosophers to neurobi ologists, all participating faculty are at the frontiers of their respective fields. Empirical scientists use state -of-the-art meth odologies in modern laboratory facilities. Especially strong areas of r e- search at UAB include, but are not limited to, neurobiology, vision science, functional brain imaging, language, aging, and philosophy of mind. Developmental Psychology The Development al Psychology doctoral program trains scientists to conduct research to discover and apply basic pri n- ciples of developmental psychology in an i nterdisciplinary context and to apply those principles to a variety of problems. Graduates are capable of taking positions in inst itutions of higher learning, medical schools, research institutions. Go v- ernment agencies, and other research and teaching positions. Research training is provided by the faculty of the Department of Ps ychology and my occur in collaboration with faculty at the Civitan International Research Center, Center for the ad- vancement of Youth Health, the Center for Aging, the Center for Applied Gerontology, the Comprehensive Youth Violence Center, the Department of Pediatrics, the school of Public Health, and other centers and d epartments. The research programs of faculty with interests in lifespan developmental psychology include a wide variety of to pics from infancy to the elderly. Much of this r esearch is funded by federal research grants. Research sub-areas include: mental retardation and developmental disabilities (with special inte r- ests in prenatal development and exposures, early intervention, improving special education, adolescent psychosocial deve l- opment and mental health, and how family me mbers adapt to the problems of a handicapped child); adolescence (with sp e- cial interest in longitudinal studies, interactions between health and development, alcohol and drug use, predictors of depression and suicide, family and peer relations, those with special health care or education needs); aging (with special interest in visual -perceptual problems of older adults with slow vision, memory skills training with elderly populations, the psychological aspects of chronic il lness in the elderly, chronically il l individuals, care giving in families of elderly persons, human factor issues in vision and aging); pediatric psychology (with special interest in influ ences on injury risk, how handicapped children adapt and develop socially, parental cognition and affec tive reactions as mediators of behavioral responses toward their young children, and evaluation of b e- havioral health care interventions); and language and comm u- nication disorders (with special interest in the development of speech percep tion and word segme ntation in young children, how word segmentation may relate to beginning reading, and developmental changes in abilities to use computer -assisted communic ation systems). Medical/Clinical Psychology The Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization pr ovides scientist -practitioner training in clinical psychology with an emphasis on investigation and service delivery in a medical setting, oriented toward the prevention and treatment of med i- cal disorders and the enhancement of health. This pr ogram of study is cosp onsored by the UAB School of Medicine. Coursework, research, and clinical clerkship training are pr o- vided by faculty psychologists in the Departments of Psycho l- ogy, Rehabilitation Medicine, Psychiatry, Neurology, Pedia-trics, Surgery (Divisions of Neurosurgery and Cardiovascular Surgery), and Medicine (including the Divisions of General and Preventive Medicine, Rheumatology, Arthritis, and Gas- troenterology), the Center for Aging, the Sparks Center for Developmental and Learning Disorders, the Civitan Intern a- tional Research Center; the VA Medical Center, and the UAB School of Public Health. In addition, psychologists in se veral health psychology- behavioral medicine and mental health ce n- ters in the community play an active teaching, research, and clinical super visory role in this pr ogram. Current research programs in which faculty and students are involved include AIDS treatment -efficacy and co m- pliance; HIV/AIDS -risk pediatri -congenital infections and mental development; ga s- troenterology -irritable bowel syndrome and rumination; head injury center \u2014rehabilitation, neurovascular surgery research; cocaine and other drug d e- pendence- treatment, dev elopment and evaluation; very low birth -weight project; pain clinic intervention program; mental retardation -Down's syndrome parent coping project, Al zhei- disease diagnosis and caregiver projects; and neur opsy- chological evaluations of epilepsy surgery ; brain injury studies of behavioral and medical interventions and of ima ging corr e- lates of psychological processes; improving health status and utilization; cardiovascular risk assessment and r eduction in minority populations; access to ca ncer screening a nd care in underserved populations; Women's tive Multi- Center Project; as sessing and modifying women's and other health risks; and smoking cessation interve ntions. This is a representative but not exhaustive list. Most Medical Ps y- chology faculty research is extramurally funded by pr ivate foundations and other federal support, especially through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and from var ious institutes of The National Inst itutes of Health (NIH). It is possible to enroll in the Mas ter of Public Health d e- gree program concurrently with enrollment in the Medical -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 182 Psychology Program; this requires the approval of both the Medical Psychology specialization director and the UAB School of Pu blic Health. Application The deadline for receipt of a complete application for a d- mission is January 15 (December 15 for Medical/Clinical Psychology Program) preceding the beginning of the pr o- gram in September. Applications are solicited both from st u- dents with bachelor's degrees and from those who may ha ve already completed some graduate study. The GRE General Test is required. The GRE Subject Test in psychology is rec- ommended. Admission Admission to the program is highly selective. Successful applicants usually present scores of at least 600 on both the verbal and quantitative po rtions of the GRE General Test and a minimum 1,200 overall score (verbal plus quantitative). Minimum GPAs of 3.2 (A = 4.0) overall, over the last two years and in psychology courses, are typical for those admi t- ted. Behavioral Neu roscience. Because of the interdiscipl inary nature of the Behavioral Neuroscience specialization, students with diverse backgrounds in psychology, biology, and phys i- cal science are encouraged to apply. All students are expected to have undergraduate traini ng in psychology, biology, phy s- ics, chemistry, and mathematics. Students not trained in one or more of these areas may be required to make up deficits after enrol lment. Cognitive Science. For admission to the Cognitive Science special ization, the minimal c riteria are those of the Graduate School. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the graduate pr o- gram in Cognitive Science, students having undergraduate degrees in a wide variety of disciplines are encouraged to ap- ply. Previous work in psychology, philosophy, biology, li n- guistics, or computer science is especially appropriate. Bac k- ground interest, research experience, letters of recommend a- tion, Undergraduate GPA, and GRE scores represent impo r- tant aspects of the admission criteria. Developmental Psychology. Admission to the Developmental Psychology specialization requires undergrad uate work in psychology, biology, and mathematics. Students without u n- dergraduate coursework in these areas may be required to take additional coursework after e nrollment. Medical/ Clinical Psychology. The criteria for admission to the Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization include a min i- mum of 18 semester hours in psychology courses (specific courses recommended are Introduction to Psychology, Ps y- chological Statistics, Physiolog ical Psychology, Psycho logy of Learning, and Abnormal Psychology or Psychology of Pe rso- nality) and a minimum of 18 semester hours in life sc ience courses (courses in chemistry and biology/physiology). Courses in mathematics through calculus and in computer programming are recommended. Students with deficits in any of these areas may be r equired to take suitable additional coursework before and/or after enrollment. Relevant research or clinical service experiences are considered important ind i- cations of the applicant's motivation and commitment to ps y- chology. The relevance of the student's goals and interests to the research -health psychology orientation of the specialty is also an admission consider ation. Advisement Behavioral Neuroscience students are advis ed by the B e- havioral Neuroscience specialization director in consu ltation with a graduate program steering committee and by their r e- search preceptors until the dissertation committee is ap- pointed, us ually early in the third year of study. Cognitive Science students are advised by the Co - Directors of the program in consultation with the Cogn itive Science Steering Committee. After the first year a major po r- tion of the advisement is taken over by the mentor chosen by the student. Students accepted in the Devel opmental Psycho l- ogy specialization will be assigned an advisor by the Dev e- lopmental Psychology specialization director. The advisor may be changed upon request of the st udent and agreement of the Developmental Psychology Sp ecialization director. Before arr iving on campus, Medical (Clinical) Psycho lo- gy students are assigned an advanced student mentor and a faculty advisor who chairs a Graduate Study Committee. Men- tors, advisors, and graduate study committees assigned by the specialization director and Medical Psychology C oordination Committee may be changed upon the request of the student and the agreement of the Med ical Psychology Specialization director. Curriculum The curriculum in Behavioral Neuroscience provides a student with advanced training that is b roadly based in neur os- cience. All students have a plan of coursework that includes Overview of Behavioral Neuroscience (PY Learning (PY 745). Students must also enroll in a statistics sequence (PY 716 -717) and an ongo ing seminar in current research (PY 756). A basic science elective and two psychology electives complete the academic portion of a st udent's training. Each student must enroll in a res earch practicum directed by a member of the graduate faculty during each term in residence. The student initially rotates among faculty and laboratories during the first year to obtain breadth in points of view and experimental techniques. Students then ch oose a mentor with whom they normally complete the remainder of their research trai ning. Before admission to candidacy, each student must fulfill the predissertation research requirement and pass the qualifying examination. Following acceptance of a propos al for dissert a- tion research, the student is admitted to candidacy. The Ph.D. degree is awarded upon successful defense of the di ssertation The course of study in Cognitive Science includes some required courses: Overview of Cognitive Science (PY 736), Cognition (PY 707), Cognitive Neuroscience (PY 793), a losophy of Mind course (PHL 792 or NEUR 752), a two - course sequence in Statistics (PY 716 & PY 717) and an ong o- ing Research Seminar in Cognitive Science (PY 730). The student chooses additional courses from a broad menu of courses in various departments to match their areas of interest. For example, one of the additional courses must be a metho- dology course which can be fulfilled by taking a course in functional brain imaging, computational neuroscience , mult i- variate statistics, computer modeling, or neurobiological tec h- niques. Students do either two or three research rotations in their first year for exposure to different approaches and exp e- rimental techniques before settling with a mentor in their ch o- sen field of interest. Students are encouraged to develop a sy s-UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 183 tematic line of research that complements that of his or her advisor. Students normally complete the remainder of their research training with this mentor but may opt to change. B e- fore a dmission to candidacy, each st udent must fulfill the pre - dissertation research requirement and pass the qualifying ex-amination. Following acceptance of a proposal for dissertation research, the student is admitted to candidacy. The Ph.D. d e- gree is awarded upon suc cessful defense of the dissertation. Each student in the Developmental Psychology special i- zation is encouraged to develop a systematic line of r esearch that complements that of his or her advisor. With intense e x- posure to an important aspect of development al research, the student acquires skills that can be generalized to a var iety of problems. Students are required to complete a lifespan dev e- lopmental psychology sequence, including an overview course (PY 708), an adolescent d evelopmental course (PY 729), a nd an aging course (PY 785). An additional 12 hours in general developmental psychology is required from a range of course options psychology st udents are also required to complete two terms of teachi ng practicum (PY 796), and four -courses in statistics and research design (including PY 716, 717, 719). Additional requirements include at least 9 credit hours of ele c- tives in courses such as social psychology, theories of em o- tion, psychological tests and measur ement, introduction to neurobiology, geriatric and gerontology interdisciplinary core curriculum, and reading (theoretical found ations). Developmental Psychology students must complete a master's thesis. Admission to candidacy for the doctoral d e- gree is based on satisfactory completion of cours ework and completion of an area review in the form of a Psychological Bulletin or Psychological Review article. In some special cas- es, a coursework option may be subst ituted for the area review with approval by the student's advisor and the Deve lopmental Psychology specialization director. The do ctoral degree is awarded upon successful defense of the di ssertation. The Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization places strong emphasis on integration of biological a nd beha vioral sciences. Research and clinical training require an under gra- duate background in both psychology and life science. The program requires continued pursuit of a pplied biological and psychological skills and knowledge b asic to health psychology research and practice. The cu rriculum includes three broad areas: 1. Basic biological and psychological knowledge, inclu d- ing cognitive biological and social- emotional basis of beha- vior, individual differences, statistics and research methodo lo- gy, pr ofession al issues, and ethics; 2. Professional skill and knowledge, including asses s- ment, intervention, evaluation, and consu ltation; and 3. Medical psychology. Students pursue research and a clinical focus on one or more of the several available health psycholog y areas through advanced scientific and applied coursework, clinical clerkship, and d irected research activities that typically culminate in the doctoral dissertation. Course requirements for the Medical (Clinical) Psycho lo- gy specialization include but are not limited to 1. Statistics and Research Design -a four -course s equence; 2. Clinical Psychological Assessment- a one -year mod ular course sequence; 3. Psychological Intervention -a four -course s equence; 4. General Psychology -History and Systems and three of the following courses: Learning Processes, Cognition, Motiva-tion and Emotion, Developmental Psycho logy, Sensory and Perceptual Processes, and Social Psycho logy; 5. Health Psychology -a five -course series, three of which involve choices from alternatives suc h as neurops ychology, psychopharmacology, psychophysiology, ne ural and humoral bases of behavior, and health psychology, plus elective sem i- nars in fields such as rehabilitation, a ging, neuropsychology; cardiology, and 6. Psychopathology, Theories of Person ality, and Profe s- sional Issues and Ethics (all required courses). Additional courses and/or seminars may be taken as elec- tives. The student's advisor may also require add itional coursework for a chosen area of emphasis. Courses in many departments of the u niversity are available on an elective b a- sis. Students are required to complete a minimum of 18 sem e- ster hours of research and 18 semester hours of clinical cler k- ship. A master's project is co mpleted in the second year. Students in Medical (Clinical) Psych ology are also r e- quired to serve a 12- month internship in clinical psycho logy in a medical facility. The internship must be in a program, ou t- side of UAB, accredited by the American Psychological Ass o- ciation or be approved by the Medical Psychology Coordina t- ing Committee. Financial Aid All students admitted to the Behavioral Neuroscience, Cogn i- tive Science, Developmental Psychology, and Med i- cal/Clinical Psychology specializations may expect to receive financial aid. Sources of support include fellowships and re- search and teaching assistantships.

Pro gram Mission As an essential component of an urban research unive rsi- ty, the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) pr ogram at the University of Alabama at Birmingham provides a depar t- ment -based multi -disciplinary faculty dedicated to the ad- vancement of t he public service through teaching, r esearch, and service. Program Objective The Master of Public Administration program prepares individuals for positions of leadership in the public and no n- profit sectors of the eco nomy. It is a professional graduate degree for both pre -career students and in -service administr a- tors. The program is designed to de velop the insights and skills needed to plan and formulate policy, and to organize, manage, and implement programs and operations. Graduates tend to cluster in thre e general areas managers, analysts, and policy specia lists. The M.P.A. curriculum is designed to ensure that st u- dents: (1) understand the political, economic, social and legal context of the public service; (2) understand and appreciate the transcending va lues of ethics/morality and diversity in the public service; (3) achieve substantial competence in (i) po li- cy-making processes; (ii) administr ative theory and behavior, (iii) human resource management; (iv) budgeting; (v) urban development and planning; (v i) research design and (vii) st a- tistical analysis. To a ccomplish these objectives, students complete an eight -course core curriculum that provides a foundation for more specia lized coursework as well as long - term development and advancement in public servi ce ma n- agement and leadership positions. The M.P.A. program is a c- credited by the National Association of Schools of Public A f- fairs and Administration (NA SPAA). Degree Requirements Students in the M.P.A. program must complete a total of 51 semester hours or the equivalent, with an overall grade average of at least B. Six of those hours are earned in an i n- ternship placement, although that requirement may be waived for students who have full -time paid work exper ience in public or nonprofit agencies. Previous gr aduate work at UAB or another institution may be credited toward the degree if it is directly applicable. Students may select the thesis option or the nonthesis option. For students who are interested in both public administration and the delivery of public health servi c- es, a coordinated M.P.A. -M.P.H. pr ogram is offered; for st u- dents who are interested in both public administration and the law, a coordinated M.P.A. -J.D program is o ffered. UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 187 Admission Requirements Because of its multi -disciplinary nature, per sons from all undergraduate majors are considered for admission to the pr o- gram.

Program The M.P.A./M.P.H. is designed to train individuals for administrative positions in public health and related health organiza tions. The Master of Public Administration degree prepares students for careers as administrators in public and nonprofit agencies, and the Ma s- ter of Public Health pr ovides a background in public health principles and programs. Students must apply to, and enroll in, both programs, meeting each program's entry requir ements. Program Req uirements Students are required to complete a total of 60 semester hours for the coordinated de gree. A mi n- imum of 24 hours must be completed from each program; the remaining 12 hours may come from either program.

The M.P.A. program at UAB and the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University offer a coordinated M.P.A. -J.D. program. The o ffering of this dual degree reflects recognition of the co mplex interrelatio n- ship between the legal system, public policy analysis, and pu b- lic management. It will be particularly applicable to those pu r- suing careers in government and/or pub lic interest law. Students must apply and be admitted to the M.P.A. and JD programs separately. The requirements for each degree must be met. Close communication with both programs is r e- quired. Depending on prior experience, a field placement may be required. A thesis is optional. Comprehensive Examination During the last semes ter of study, students must successfully complete a compr ehensive examination. Such an exam will require the student to synth es- ize material learned over the course of the program. Should the student need to rewrite any part of the exam, he/she may be requi red to enroll in the subs equent term for MPA 692 in order to rewrite the questions missed. M.P.A. Alumni Association An active alumni association welcomes graduates of the program into membership. The association makes both adv i- sory and financial contribu tions to the program and seeks to elevate the level of professionalism in public administr ation through a variety of projects and services.

Applicants lac king 18 semester hours in social science courses will be evaluated individually for academic deficiencies. Supplemental cours e- work may be recommended by the graduate faculty. Students admitted to the Sociology graduate program choose one of three areas of specialization: urban inequality, health and aging, or social ps ycholo gy. The program provides both Plan I (thesis) and Plan II (nonthesis) options. The M.A. degree is conferred upon the fulfillment of the requir ements outlined below. All students must fulfill the first two requirements. The third requirement differs for Pla n I and Plan II students. 1. All four of the following core courses are r equired for all students: SOC 701 Data Management and Analysis SOC 703 Advanced Statistics SOC 705 Methodology of Social Research SOC 707 Macrosociological Theory 2. Students must complete at least two courses from one of the four following areas of special ization: Urban Inequality SOC 716 Social Stratification SOC 740 Deviant Behavior SOC 755 Race and Ethnic Relations SOC 756 Gender Inequality SOC 757 International Ine quality SOC 774 The Sociology of Policy Analysis SOC 775 Urban Ecology SOC 778 Demography SOC 779 Experiencing Urban Life Health and Aging SOC 721 Social Psychology of Health & Illness SOC/GER 759 Social Gerontology SOC/GER 769 Sociology of t he Life Cycle SOC/GER 777 Demography of Health and Aging SOC 780 Medical Sociology SOC 787 Sociology of Mental Health SOC 781 Sociology of Health SOC 788 Social Medicine SOC/GER 796 Research Seminar in Health and Aging Social Psychology SOC 7 11 Qualitative Methods SOC 720 Microsociological Theory SOC 721 Social Psychology of Health & Illness SOC/GER 769 Sociology of the Life Cycle SOC 779 Experiencing Urban Life Under special circumstances, with written approval from the student's ad visor and the sociology graduate program di- rector, an independent study course may be substituted for specialty courses. 3. Students must complete the following additional r e- quirements, depending on whether they are pursuing Plan I or Plan II: UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 191 Plan I (The sis) Option At least two additional substantive courses (these may be in areas outside of sociology, subject to approval by the Sociol o- gy graduate program director); 6 semester hours of thesis research (SOC 699); an acceptable research -based thesis; and a final oral examination based on the thesis. Plan II (Nonthesis) Option At least five additional substantive courses (two of these courses may be in an area outside of sociology, subject to the approval of the Sociology graduate program dire ctor); a compr ehensive written examination in the student's area of specialization. Medical Sociology Ph.D. Program This program is designed to provide students with the coursework and research experiences to become leading r e- searchers and practitioners in medical socio logy. Doctoral training in medical sociology exposes students to the central issues of the field through a variety of methodological tec h- niques encompassing both qualitative and quantitative a p- proaches. Graduate students study the social and cultural bases of health beliefs and behaviors, organizational stru ctures of health care delivery, and patient -practitioner relationships, to name just a few examples. Students acquire expertise in theory formulation and data analysis. There are abundant research opport unities for graduate students to work with faculty on projects in medical se ttings across the campus. The department pursues o pportunities for graduate student exchange arrangements with medical socio l- ogy programs in European and Japanese univers ities. Adm ission Admission to the Ph.D. program in medical sociology r e- quires a minimum overall score of 1150 on the GRE (verbal and quantitative); minimum GPAs of 3.0 (A = 4.0), or a 3.2 GPA for the last 60 semester hours in a B.A. or B.S. program and 3.5 GPA in al l previous graduate cours ework. Students should have co mpleted at least 18 hours in social science courses, including social theory, statistics, and research m e- thods. Students entering the program with a ma ster's degree will be granted waivers for a maximu m of 24 s emester hours of substantive graduate work, with the permi ssion of the gra d- uate program director and the professors who teach parallel courses. Exceptional students who fail to meet any of the above requir ements will be evaluated on a case -by-case basis. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Medical S o- ciology Ph.D. program, students with diverse backgrounds in social science and health -related fields are encouraged to ap- ply. Students lacking adequate backgrounds in theory, r e- search methods , or statistics may be required to make up def i- cits after enrollment. Students pursuing the doctoral degree must follow Plan I (thesis plan) of the existing master's degree program by pr o- ducing a research -based thesis, but two types of documents will be ac ceptable. The first alternative is a longer, traditional thesis organized in the form of a short book mon ograph. This option is especially appropriate for qualitatively based r e- search. The second alternative is a manuscript in the standard form of a journa l article with appended mater ials. Advising The Graduate Director will provide continuous advis e- ment on academic progress during the student's graduate study, including course selection and research/clinical exp e- riences consi stent with the student's develo ping interests and abilities. Research supervision is provided by faculty whom st u- dents select to chair the master's thesis and Ph.D. dissert ation commi ttees. Typically, the student will select persons with whom a close, supportive relationship develops. The placement of Ph.D. students in research sites is an important part of the Medical Sociology Program. Such sites may i nvolve assisting faculty on research grants or working in a clinical setting under the supervision of a faculty member. Such experience s will provide students with invaluable real- life exposure to medical socio logy \"in action.\" As such, they are important accompaniments to the in -class course work of the Ph.D. program. Curriculum The components of the Ph.D. program are as follows: Medical Sociology Core (9 hr: SOC 780 and two of the following: 721, 735, 781, 787, 788); Sociological Theory Core (6 hr: SOC 707, and either 720 or 722); Research Methods and Statistics Core (12 hr: SOC 701, 703, 705, and 711); Profes thesis credit hours (6 hr); Ph.D. Dissertation Credit Hours (24 hr). Financial Aid All students admitted to the Ph.D. program will be considered for financial aid. Sources include graduate fello wships and assistantships.

The primary objective of the graduate program in vision science is to train individuals who will develop innov a- tive approaches to teaching and research in vis ion science. To meet this objective, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees require a cu r--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 196 riculum covering major topics in vision science along with an original research pr oject. In addition to the course offerings in vision science, the program offers considerable flexibility in meeting the individ-ual student's needs and career goals. The pr ogram encourages students to participate in the wide range of graduate courses offered by other departments of the university. I ndeed, the program is interdepartmental in scope, wit h mentors in eleven different departments ranging from Cell Biology to Psychol o- gy. The graduate program in vision science also offers a 7 - year, O.D. -Ph.D. degree program, which combines training in clinical optometry with research in vision sc ience. This is a unique opportunity for students to be trained as clinician - scientists whose knowledge of the eye and cen tral visual pathways will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and pr e- vention of blindness and visual impai rment. Although laboratory and researc h training are emphasized in both the Ph.D. and O.D. -Ph.D. programs, st udents also have opportunities to gain teaching experience. An appropriate background for study in vision science includes study at the baccalaureate or master's level in a biological, neurological, physical, or health -related sci ence. The program has an excellent record of preparing students for rewarding careers in teaching, r esearch, or health care. Admission and Financial Aid Applications for admission to the graduate program in v i- sion science are reviewed by the Graduate Admissions Co m- mittee. The committee looks at the applicants' scores in the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). A combined score of at least 1000 in the verbal and quantitative se ctions of the GRE exam is required for the M.S. degree, and at least 1200 for the Ph.D. degree. Students currently enrolled in the Ph.D. program have an average GRE score of 1300. Admission also requires undergrad uate grades of at least a B average over the previous 60 semester hours of credit , and three letters of recommend a- tion. Applicants should have a strong background in the bi o- logical, physical, or health sciences. Students with suitable foreign qualifications are welcome to apply, but must demon- strate a command of written and spoken En glish, in addition to a score of at least 570 on the TOEFL examination. Over the past fi fteen years, 40% of the graduates of the program have been women. We continue to encourage qualified women and underrepresented minorities to a pply. M.S. Degree Some stud ents may wish to pursue graduate training at the master's level. Two calendar years are needed to complete the M.S. degree in vision science. Each cand idate must complete a minimum of 30 hours of credit: 24 credit hours in vision science and 6 credit hours in related graduate courses. In addition, the candidate must successfully complete a research thesis by the conclusion of the final year. Selected students in the UAB optometry professional pr o- gram are encouraged to combine the O.D. degree with the M.S. degree in Vision Science. Financial assistance is avai la- ble for qualified students. Potential candidates should have completed undergraduate degree in a biological, physical, or health sc ience field. Ph.D. Degree The Ph.D. degree is based upon completion o f graduate course work, a qualifying examination, research, and a disse r- tation and defense. There is considerable flex ibility in the cours ework for the Ph.D. in vision science. Each student is required to take the first- year core curric u- lum (VIS 743 thru 748). Students then take three add itional courses, selected by the student in consultation with the me n- tor, and a course in statistics. The program is flexible so that, for example, students who have interests in visual neuro s- cience may take courses in the neuroscience sequence: VIS 729, Introduction to Neurobiology; Cellular obiology; Integrative Neuroscience; and Developmental Neur oscience. Similarly, students interested in the cellular and molecular biology of the visual system may take the Cellular and Molecu lar Biology (CMB) Program core sequence, or they may select from the upper -level v ision courses. Other courses at a similar level can be substituted so that students can take maximum advantage of offerings in other programs. Individ uals with clinical backgrounds will have an opportunity for clinical development. Students are also offered an opportunity to gain teaching exper ience. The O.D. -Ph.D. program prepares students for careers that combine clinical optometry and clinical and/or basic r e- search in vision science. This program involves a combin ation of basic science, research, and clinical training. The program is geared toward students who have outstanding scholastic qualifications and are highly mot ivated to pursue careers as clinician-scientists. Because students in this program will receive substa ntial benefits, admission is highly competitive. Information about admission requirements and application proc edures can be obtained by writing to the graduate program dire ctor.

These include policies concerning health care for intern ational students and visiting international scholars, AIDS and AIDS -related cond i- tions, a drug -free workplace, al coholic beverage use, smoking, sexual harassment, elec tronic data processing security, and computer software use. Copies of these policies are avai lable in the Graduate School Office. Appendix II: UAB Student Records Policy The General Education Provisions Act, Section 438, as amended, and the regulations promulgated for the e nforcement of the act, found at 45 Federal Register 30911, as amended at 45 Federal Register 86296, provide that all students enrolled or previously enrolled at the University of Alabama at Bi r- mingham have the following rights in relation to their educ a- tional records: I. General Policy No information from records, files, or othe r data directly related to a student, other than public information defined be-low, shall be disclosed to individuals or age ncies outside the university without the written consent of the st udent, except those disclosures set forth in paragraph IX. II. Def inition of Educational Record Student educational records are defined as those records, files, documents, and other material which contain information directly related to students and which are maintained by UAB or a party acting for UAB. Records of instru ctional, superv i- sory, and administrative personnel which are in the sole po s- session of the maker and a ccessible only to the maker or a substitute are specifically excluded from this definition of educational record. Educational records of st udents are not available to UAB Police personnel, and records of the Unive r- sity Police, which, at UAB, are maintained separately from educational records, are maintained solely for purpose of law enforcement, and are not disclosed to individuals other than law enforcemen t personnel of the same jurisdiction, are not part of the educational record. Records which are made or maintained by physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or ot h- er professionals or paraprofessionals and which are mai ntained in connection with treatmen t and are not available to anyone else are also excluded from a student's educational record, but such records are available to another physician or appropriate profe ssional of the student's choice if requested. Records which only contain information relat ing to a person after that person is no longer a student are not considered part of the student's educ ational record. III. Definition of Student For the purpose of this policy a student is defined as any individual currently or previously enrolled in any academic offering of UAB. It does not include prospe ctive students. IV. Public Information The following is a list of public information which may be made available by the university without prior consent of the st udent and which is considered part of the public record of the student's attendance: Name, address (local and perm a- nent), tel ephone number, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, dates of attendance, degrees and awards r eceived , schedule of classes, and institution most recently previously attended. The information will not be made available if a st u- dent directs a written instruction to the appropriate records official prior to the end of the registration p eriod for any given term. V. Types and Location of Records Each school maintains a file on each student enrolled, containing applications, grade reports or other perfor mance evaluations, and correspondence. Some departments or pr o- grams maintain similar files. The counseling se rvice, plac e- ment service, and financial aid office maintain a file on st u- dents who use those services. The uni versity has designated the following officials as responsible for student records with-in their respective areas: University Registrar, Aca demic A f- fairs, Room 207, Hill Un iversity Center; Dean, Graduate School, Room 511, Hill University Center; Director of Student Affairs, School of Dentistry, Room 207, School of De ntistry Building; Office of the Assistant Dean for Academic and St u- dent Affairs, 604 W ebb Building; Associate Director for Records, School of Medicine, Room P100, Volker Hall; D i- rector of Student Services, School of Nursing, Room 105B, School of Nursing Building; Assistant Dean for Student A f- fairs, School of Optometry, Room 104, School of O ptometry Building; Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, School of Public Health, Room 308, Tidwell Hall. The above shall h e- reinafter be referred to as \"records off icials.\" Each of these records officials is responsible for maintaining a listing of student records within such records official's area of respons i- bility, i ndicating the location and general content of the records. Any student request concerning records or files, i n- cluding requests that public information not be disclosed, r e- quests for discl osure to third parties, and requests for access by the student should be directed to this official. Forms for all such requests may be o btained from these officials. These per- sons will also act as hearing officers when the content of a record is chal lenged as p rovided below. VI. Disclosure of Student Records to the Student The student is accorded the right to inspect, in the pres- ence of a university staff member, records, files, and data pr i- marily and directly related to the student. To in spect a file a student should go to the office of the appropriate records off i- cial and initiate a request in writing. If a student desires to obtain copies of the items in the ed ucational record rather than personally reviewing the record, the written request to the records off icial for copies must be signed and notarized to prevent disclosure to pe rsons other than the student. A time for inspection shall be granted within forty -five days of the date of the request, and copies will be mailed within the same time period. Copies s hall be made and provided to the student at a cost to the student equal to actual cost of reprodu ction and payable in advance. The right of inspection does not include financial stat e- ments of parents, confidential recommenda tions placed in the file prior to January 1, 1975, provided that such recommenda- tions were solicited with a written assurance of confidentiality or sent or retained with a documented understanding of conf i- dentiality and used only for the purpose solicited, and other UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 199 confidential recommen dations, access to which has been waived by the student in acco rdance with paragraph VIII. VII. Challenging the Contents of the R ecord UAB will respond to any reasonable request for an expl a- nation or interpretation of any item in a student's file. R e- quest s for such explanation or interpretation should be a d- dressed in writing to the appropriate r ecords official. If, after inspecting a record, a student believes that info r- mation contained in the educational record is inaccu rate or misleading or violates his or her privacy, the student may r e- quest that the record be amended by presenting such request in writing to the appropriate records official. A request that the record be amended shall be an swered by the records official within fifteen days of its receipt with information that the record has been amended as requested or that the record has not been amended and that the student has a right to a hearing on the matter. A written request for a hearing should be ad- dressed to the appropriate records off icial as l isted in V, who will set a date and time for hearing with reasonable notice of same to the student within forty -five days of receiving the request. The request for hearing should identify the item or items in the file to be challenged and state the ground s for the chal- lenge, e.g., inaccuracy, misleading nature, ina ppropriateness. The records official shall examine the co ntested item, shall hear the person responsible for placing the item in the file if appropriate, and shall examine any documents or hear any testimony the student wishes to present. A student may be assisted or represented by ind ividuals of his or her choice, including an attorney, at his or her own expense. The records official may decide that the item should be retained or that it should be deleted or al tered. The records official shall issue a written dec ision, based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing, within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing. If the decision is adverse to the st udent, the notice of decision shall include a statement that the student has the right to place a statement in the record commenting on the info rmation and/or setting forth reasons for disagreeing with the dec ision. VIII. Waiver of Access UAB may request that a student waive the student's right to inspect confidential recommendations respecting that st u- dent's application for admission, provided that the student be notified, upon request, of the names of all those providing the recommendations, the recommendations are used only for the purpose solicited, and the waiver is not a condition of admi s- sion or any other benefit. Confidential recommendations r es- pecting applic ation for employment or the receipt of an honor or other re cognition may also be waived. A waiver may be revoked with respect to actions occu r- ring after revocation by so notifying the records official in writing. IX. Providing Records to Third Parties The general policy of UAB is to refuse access to or di s- closure of information from student records to third pa rties without the writte n consent of the student. Should a student wish to have such records released, a signed and dated written request must be directed to the proper records official, specif y- ing the r ecords to be released, the reason for release, the party or class of parties to whom records are to be released, and a request for copies to the student, if desired. UAB will then transfer or grant access to the information. The transferred information shall contain a statement that the information may be used by the r eceiving part y or, if an organization, by its officers, agents, and employees for the purpose requested, but that the party shall not transfer the information to any other party except with the written co nsent of the student. A charge not to exceed the actual cost of r eproduction will be assessed against the student when co pies are made for the party or the student. Student records are available to the following persons with the accompanying conditions without written consent of the st udent: 1. Instructional or adminis trative personnel whose duties include responsibilities to students which in the institution reasonably require access to student r ecords. 2. Officials of other schools in which a student seeks to enroll. UAB will make a reasonable attempt to notify the stu- dent of the transfer, as well as the student's right to a copy, upon request, and the right to a hearing to challenge the co n- tents if d esired. 3. Certain representatives of federal departments or agen- cies or state educational authorities as provided by th e law. In absence of consent or specific authorization by federal law of the collection of personally identifiable data, data collected by excepted officials shall be protected in a manner which will not permit personal identific ation of students and paren ts by other than those officials, and personally identif iable data shall be destroyed when no longer needed. 4. Financial aid officers or their assistants in connection with the application for or receipt of financial aid, provided that personally identifiable information may only be disclosed for the purpose of determining eligibility, amount, and condi- tions and to enforce terms and cond itions. 5. Organizations conducting studies for administrative evaluation, tests, etc., provided that studies are not co nducted in a manner which will permit personal identification of st u- dents or their parents by other than representatives of the o r- ganization and that the information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes co llected. 6. Accrediting organiza tions. 7. Other appropriate persons in an emergency to protect health or safety of students or others. In determining appr o- priateness of disclosure, consideration will be given to the seriousness of the threat to health or safety of the student and others, the need for information to meet the emergency, whether the parties requesting inform ation are in a position to deal with the eme rgency, and the extent to which time is of the essence. 8. In response to lawful subpoena or court order. UAB will keep a record, indicating the name and legit i- mate interest, of all discl osures except those made to a student, those made pursuant to written consent, those designated as public information, and those made to persons at UAB with a legiti mate educational interest. Th is record of disclosure will become a part of the educational record, subject to inspec tion and review. X. The UAB Student Records Policy shall be published in the catalog of each school, and a copy shall be displayed prom inently on a bulletin board in ea ch school. In order to comply with the requirement that UAB give annual notice of this policy to enrolled students, a short notice of the po licy shall be included in the Class Schedule for each term. XI.

Washington, D.C. 20202 Appendix III: Non -Resident Tuition Policy February 9, 1990 The following policy was approve d by the Board of Tru s- tees of the University of Alabama as Board Rule 202 on D e- cember 5, 1997. For information regarding the implementation of this policy at UAB, see the UAB Non -resident Tuition Po li- cy Stat ement. I. Non -resident Tuition Fee A. All student s registering at the University of Alabama, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, or the University of Al abama in Huntsville who do not establish that they are \"resident students\" shall pay a \"non- resident student\" tuition which shall be at least twice that of \"resident student\" tu ition. B. Classification of students as \"non -resident students\" or \"resident students\" shall be made at the time of their in itial registration and shall continue unchanged through all subs e- quent registrations at that institutio n until satisfactory evidence to the contrary is submitted at the time of any subsequent re g- istration. C. A \"resident student\" is one who, at the time of registr a- tion: D. Is not a \"minor\" and is a resident of the state of Ala- bama and has been a resident of the state for at least one year immed iately preceding the date of registration; or E. Is a \"minor\" and whose \"supporting person(s)\" is a re s- ident of the state of Alabama and has been a resident of the state for at least one year immediately preceding the date of registr ation. II. Definitions A. Minor An individual who, because of age, lacks the capacity to contract under Alabama law. Under current law, this means a single individual under nineteen (19) and a married individual under eighteen (18), but excl udes an individual whose disabil i- ties of non -age have been removed by a court of comp etent jurisdiction for a reason other than establishing a legal res i- dence in Al abama. B. Supporting person Either or both of the parents of the student (if they are li v- ing together) or if they are divorced or living separate, then either the parent having legal custody or, if different, the pa r- ent providing the greater amount of financial support of the two. If both parents are deceased or if neither had legal cu sto- dy, then supporting person, shall mean, in the following o rder; legal custodian of the student, and, if none, the guardian, and, if none, the co nservator. C. Resident One whose residence is in the state of Alabama. Res i- dence means the single location at which a person resides with the intent of remaining there indefinitely as evi denced by more substantial connections with that place than with any other place. Individuals carrying resident status under this policy shall certify under penalty for per jury that a speci fic address or location within the state of Alabama is their residence, that they intend to remain there indefinitely, and that they have more substantial co nnections with the state of Alabama than with any other state. Though certification of an address and an intent to remain in the state indefinitely are prerequ isites to establishing status as a resident, ultimate determin ation of that status shall be made by the institution by its evaluation of the presence or absence of connections with the state of Al abama including the fo llowing: 1. Payment of Alabama state income taxes as a res ident 2. Ownership of a residence or other real property in the state and payment of state ad valorem taxes thereon 3. Full -time employment (not temporary) in the state 4. Resi dence in the state of a spouse, parents, or chi ldren 5. Previous periods of residency in the state co ntinuing for one year or more 6. Voter registration and voting in the state; more signif i- cantly, continuing voter registration in the state that in itially occurred at least one year prior to the initial reg istration of the student in Alabama at a public institution of higher educ ation 7. Possession of state or local licenses to do business or practice a profession in the state 8. Ownership of personal proper ty in the state and pa y- ment of state taxes thereon (e.g. automobile, boat, etc.) and possession of state license plates 9. Continuous physical presence in the state for a purpose other than attending school and except for temporary absences for travel, military service, temporary emplo yment, etc. 10. Membership in religious, professional, bus iness, civic, or social organizations in the state 11. Maintenance in the state of checking and saving ac- counts, safe deposit boxes, or inves tment accounts 12. In -state address shown on selective service registr a- tion, driver's license, automobile title registration, hun ting and fishing license, insurance policies, stock and bond registr a- tions, last will and testament, annuities, or retir ement plans 13. Location within th e state of the high school from which the individual graduated. III. Authority to Expand the Definition of \"Resident St u- dent\" The President of each campus may recommend to the Chancellor for consideration by the Board of Tru stees that the term \"resident st udent\" may include any one or more of the following categories, at that ca mpus: A. One who, at the time of registration, is not a \"minor\" and: 1. Is a full -time employee (not temporary) of the instit u- tion at which the student is registering or is the spous e of such an employee; 2. Is able to verify full -time permanent employment wit h- in the state of Alabama and shall commence said e mployment not more than ninety (90) days after registr ation with the insti- tution, or is the spouse of such an employee; 3. Is a member or the spouse of a member of the United States military on full -time active duty stationed in Ala bama under orders for duties other than attending school; 4. Is employed as a graduate assistant or fellow by the i n- stitution at which the student is re giste ring; or 5. Is a resident of any county within fifty (50) miles of the campus of the institution at which the student is registe ring, UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 201 and had been a resident of that county for at least one year immediately preceding the date of regi stration. \"Residen t\" shall have the same meaning, as to the relevant county, which it has as to the state of Alabama in the def initions section of this policy statement. B. One who, at the time of registration, is a \"minor\" and whose supporting person(s)\": 1. Is a full -time employee (not temporary) of the instit u- tion at which the student is registering; 2. Is able to verify full -time permanent employment wit h- in the state of Alabama and shall commence said e mployment not more than ninety (90) days after registr ation with the inst i- tution; 3. Is a member of the United States military on full- time active duty stationed in Alabama under o rders for duties other than attending school; or 4. Is a resident of any county within fifty (50) miles of the campus of the institution at which the student is registe ring, and has been a resident of that county for at least one year immediately preceding the date of regi stration. \"Resident\" shall have the same meaning, as to the relevant county, which it has as to the state of Alabama in the def initions section of this policy statement. IV. Authority to Implement Policy The Presidents are authorized (and authorized to delegate to admissions officers and others) and directed to impl ement this policy by appropriate written policies, guidelines, and procedures. B. Such policy shall provide that classification as a \"res i- dent student\" shall be based upon the required certificate and other written evidence to be filed in the admi ssions office and that any decision by an admissions officer may be appealed by the student to a review committee which shall be constituted, appointed, and ope rated as provided in such policy. C. The decision of the review committee may be ap pealed to the President, whose action thereon shall be final. UAB Non -resident Tuition Po licy Statement UAB students are governed by the Board of Trustees' Non-resident Tuition Policy, above, which applies to stu dents enrolled in each of the campuses of the Univer sity of Alabama System. The policy is implemented at UAB in acco rdance with the f ollowing guidelines. The Board of Trustees has established a \"Non -resident Tuition Policy\" which addresses non -resident tuition, certific a- tion of residency status by campus officials, and establishment of campus policies to administer an appeals process. T his UAB policy implements certain provisions of that Board po li- cy. The Division of Student Affairs, the Graduate School, and the admissions/registration offices of the Health A ffairs schools, as appropriate, are designated as the offices emp o- wered at UAB t o determined and certify \"resident\" or \"non - resident\" student status. These offices are respons ible for do- cumenting each residency status evaluation and for mai ntain- ing the r ecords used to substantiate that evaluation. As the provisions of section II. of t he Board policy ind i- cate, \"though certification of an address and an intent to r e- main in the state indefinitely are prerequisites to establishing status as a resident, ultimate determ ination of that status shall be made by the institution by its evaluation of the presence or absence of connections with the state of Alabama...\" Ho wev- er, meeting the specific crit eria included in section II. of the Board policy may not in all circumstances result in certific a- tion as a \"resident student.\" Also, according to the p rovisions of the Board policy, UAB has been given the authority to e x- pand, and has by separate Board resolution expanded, the d e- finition of \"resident student\" to enco mpass all the categories in sections III.A. and III.B. of the Board policy. [In general, i n- ternational students who have not been issued a U.S. res ident alien card may not be consi dered for residency status for tu i- tion purposes unless they hold a graduate assistantship or fe l- lowship and meet certain criteria. International students who have bee n issued a U.S. resident alien card will be co nsidered for residency status for tuition purposes in the same manner as are U.S. cit izens.] The decision by an admissions or registration officer co n- cerning certification of residency status may be ap pealed in writing by the student to the Vice President for Student Affairs who may overrule the decision or may, at his or her discretion, convene a review committee composed of a represent ative from the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, a represent a- tive from the Office of the Vice President for Academic A f- fairs, and a representative from the Office of the Vice Pres i- dent for Health Affairs [or appropriate current UAB officials]. If the decision of the review committee is appealed by the student, the Vice Presid ent for Student Affairs may add a rec- ommend ation of concurrence or non- concurrence with the review committee and forward the findings to the President for determination. The decision of the Pres ident is final. Appendix IV: Equal Opportunity Policy August 2, 1993 (Edited January 31, 1996, for change of Faculty Affirm a- tive Action Officer and November 17, 1999, for change of Director of EEO Programs and Compl iance) Replaces the following UAB policies: \"Equal Opportunity Policy\" dated February 12, 1993, and all previous versions \"Nondiscrimination Policy\" (Long Form) dated January 31, 1990 \"Nondiscrimination Policy\" (Short Form) dated January 31, 1990 See also the UAB \"Sexual Harassment\" po licy. Policy Statement The University of Alabama at Birmingham hereby rea f- firms its policy of equal opportunity in education and e m- ployment. Equal Employment Opportunity The University of Alabama at Birmingham is expressly committed to maintaining and promoting nondiscrimin ation in all aspects of recruitment and employment of i ndividuals at all levels throughout the University. Specifically, it is the intent of the University to recruit, hire, and promote all fac ulty and staff without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national or i- gin, disability unrelated to job performance, disabled veteran status, or Vietnam era ve teran status. The University will not tolerate any conduct by an administrator, supervisor, faculty, or staff member which constitutes sexual harassment or any form of prohibited discrimination. The University has an af- firmative action program for ensuring equal employment o p- portunity for women, members of racial minority groups, i n- dividuals with disabili ties, disabled veterans, and Vietnam era veterans. The University complies with all applicable laws and -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 202 regulati ons related to nondiscrimination in employment and educ ational opportunity. All personnel actions, programs, and facilities will be a d- ministered in accordance with equal opportunity and affirm a- tive a ction policies. Implementation In working toward the imp lementation of this policy, the University will state its position as an equal opportu ni- ty/affirmative action employer in all solicitations and adve r- tisements for employment vacancies placed by, or on behalf of, the University. The University will broadly pu blish and circulate its policy of equal employment opportunity by i n- cluding a statement in all correspondence, media communic a- tion, and printed matter for employment pu rposes. Further, the University will consider, through appropriate and designated procedures, complaints or grievances of any individual who has reason to believe that he or she has been affected by pr o- hibited dis crimination. Equal Education Opportunity As an institution of higher education and in the spirit of its policies of equal employm ent opportunity, the Un iversity hereby declares its policy of equal educational opportunity. All applicants for admission will be considered without regard to an applicant's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, dis- ability unrelated to program pe rformance, disabled veteran status, or Vietnam era veteran status. This policy is noted in all student handbooks. Co mplaints or grievances of any student who has reason to think he or she has been affected by di s- crimination will be considered through establis hed proc edures. Inquiries and Complaints Any inquiries or complaints concerning the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); T itle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Executive Order 11246, as amended; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; or other legislation and its imple-menting regulations as they relate to the University of Ala-bama at Birmingham should be directed to any one of the fo l- lowing persons, as appropriate: Dr. Pamela Burks Director, EEO Programs and Compliance Staff Affirmative Action Officer 419 Medical Towers Building 205-934-8988 Dr. Virginia D.

Appendix V: Policy Concerning the Maintenance of High Ethical Standards in Research and Other Scholarly Activities January 27, 1997 (Replaces policy dated April 22, 1996.) See also the following UAB do cuments: Institutional Review Board Guidebook Institutional Review Board Assurance of Co mpliance Animal Resources Program Information Man ual. NOTE: This policy has been adapted from a statement on \"The Maintenance of High Ethical Standards in the Co nduct of Research\" published by the Executive Council of the Ass o- ciation of American Medical Colleges and has been revised to be in compliance with the Public Health Service final rule entitled \"Responsibilities of Awardee and Applicant Institu- tions for Dealing W ith and Reporting Possible Misconduct in Science.\" It incorporates recommendations of the UAB Fac ul- ty Policies and Procedures Committee and the UAB Faculty Senate. Introduction The principles that govern scientific research and scholar- ship have long been e stablished and have been applied by f a- culties and administrators for the discovery of new knowledge needed by mankind. The maintenance of high ethical sta n- dards in research based on these princi ples is a central and critical responsibility of faculties and administrators of ac a- demic institutions. Validity and accuracy in the collecting and reporting of data are intrinsically essential to the scientific process; di shonesty in these endeavors runs counter to the very nature of r esearch, that is, the pursuit o f truth. The responsibility of the academic community to the pu b- lic is acknowledged. The maintenance of public trust in this pursuit is vital. In short, it is in the best interest of the public and of academic institutions to prevent misconduct in research and to deal effectively and responsibly with instances in which misconduct is sus pected. Policy Statement 1. UAB shall accept as faculty members only those ind i- viduals whose career activities clearly demonstrate the hig hest ethical standards. To this end , the credentials of all potential faculty are to be thoroughly examined by the appropriate d e- partment/unit heads or their represent atives in order to verify the claimed accomplishments of the candidate. The appropr i- ate department/unit heads or their representatives shall seek further confirmation of the candidate's accomplishments du r- ing the normal procedures of personal interviews and letters from references. Proof of faculty credentials shall be mai n- tained by the appropriate dean or depar tment head. 2. Faculty members who are in supervisory positions with regard to colleagues, fellows, technicians, and students are expected to work closely with those individuals to provide them with appropriate guidance and counsel to the end that those individuals contin ue to maintain the highest professional and ethical sta ndards. 3. The faculty is encouraged to increase student and staff awareness of the importance of maintaining high ethical stan- dards in research and to discuss issues related to research et h- ics in form al courses, in seminars, and by other informal means. UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 203 4. Research results should be supported by verifiable ev i- dence. Faculty and staff should maintain sufficient wri tten records or other documentation of their studies. It is the r e- sponsibility of departme nt/unit heads, division directors, and experienced investigators to develop among junior col leagues and students the necessary respect for careful recording and preservation of pr imary data. 5. The faculty is encouraged to engage in free discussion of res ults, to share data and techniques, and to avoid s ecrecy in the conduct of original investigations. It should be reme m- bered that independent confirmation of results is important in direct proportion to the potential significance of the r esults in question and may be crucial to the establishment of new co n- cepts. 6. Faculty members are responsible for the quality of all reports based on their own efforts or on the collaborative work of students, technicians, or colleagues, esp ecially those which bear the facu lty member's name. The term \"reports\" as used here includes, but is not limited to, man uscripts submitted for publication and abstracts submitted for presentation at mee t- ings. The same standards of scientific integrity apply to a b- stracts as to full- length publications. Abstracts or other reports of preliminary findings should indicate clearly that the fin d- ings are preliminary. No fac ulty member shall allow his/her name to be used on any report containing results for which that faculty member cannot assume f ull professional and eth i- cal responsibi lity. 7. Any UAB employee (including, but not limited to, re g- ular and adjunct faculty, fellows, technicians, and student e m- ployees) or any UAB student who has reason to suspect any other employee or student of miscond uct with regard to the conducting or reporting of research has the responsibi lity of following up these suspicions in accordance with the proc e- dures outlined below. For purposes of this policy, \"misco n- duct\" means fabr ication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices which seriously deviate from those that are co mmon- ly accepted within the scientific community for propo sing, conducting, or reporting research. It does not include ho nest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. Intentionally withholding information relevant to the investiga tion of an alleged case of misconduct, intentionally pressuring others to do so, or bringing malicious charges against another individual shall itself be considered misco n- duct. Also, any act of interference, retaliation, or coer cion by a UAB employee against a student or employee for using this policy is prohibited and is itself a violation of this po licy. Procedures To Be Followed The \"Scientific Misconduct Allegation Review Checklist\" attached to this policy is to be used in conjunction with the procedures in this section. It is the responsibility of student employees, trainees, fe l- lows, faculty members, staff members, or other emplo yees who become aware of misconduct in research and other sch o- larly activities to report such misconduct to one of the follo w- ing: (a) their department/unit head, (b) the dean of the school in which their department/unit is located, or (c) the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. In the case of graduate students or of trainees at any level, such evidence also may be reported to the Dean of the Grad uate School. The individual receiving such evidence of misconduct must immediately report such evidence and the allegation of misconduct to the UAB Scientific Integrity Office r, the d e-partment/unit head and the dean of the unit in which the a l- leged misconduct occurred, and the Provost. If the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer determines that the allegation wa r- rants initiation of the inquiry process, the inquiry shall be i n- itiate d immed iately, and the Office of Counsel shall be i n- formed. Allegations of this nature are very serious matters, and all parties involved should take measures to assure that the pos i- tions and reputations of all individuals named in such alleg a- tions and all individuals who in good faith report apparent misconduct are protected. Details of the charge, the name of the accused, the identity of the ind ividual bringing suspected fraud, and all other information about the case shall be kept confidential as far as possible, com patible with investigating the case. Revealing confidential information to those not i n- volved in the investigation shall itself be considered misco n- duct. Because UAB is interested in protecting the health and safety of research subjects, stud ents, staff, and fa culty and because UAB is responsible for protecting spon sored research funds and for ensuring that those funds are spent for the pur- poses for which they were given, if the situation wa rrants it, interim administrative action may be used prior to conclusion of either the inquiry or the investigation to provide for the protection of individuals and funds in accordance with exis t- ing UAB policy. Such action includes, but is not limited to, administrative suspension; re -assignment of student(s ); in- volvement of the Instit utional Review Board, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the Office of Internal Audit -UAB; or notification of external sponsors when r e- quired by federal regul ations. Initial Inquiry. For purposes of this polic y, \"inquiry\" means information gathering and initial fact finding to dete r- mine whether an allegation or apparent instance of scientific misconduct warrants an invest igation. 1. The department/unit head or dean shall investigate i m- mediately the charges thro ugh an inquiry process, i ncluding an interview with the suspected individual. The person conduc t- ing the inquiry shall ensure that individuals with the necessary and appropriate expertise are consulted concerning technical aspects of the activities in question. At least one of those ind i- viduals must be from outside the suspected individual's de-partment. The record of the inquiry shall document the review of relevant ev idence. The department/unit head or dean conducting the inquiry shall keep the UAB Scienti fic Integrity Officer i nformed and may request assistance from the UAB Scientific Integrity O f- ficer. The UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall keep the O f- fice of Counsel informed during the i nquiry process, and the Office of Counsel shall provide advice concerning procedural matters. In order to ensure that a real or apparent conflict of interest does not exist, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall review the selection of persons to be involved in the i n- quiry. If it is determined that a conflict of i nterest exists, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer is responsible for desi gnating who will be involved in the i nquiry. If UAB plans to terminate an inquiry for any reason prior to completion of the normal progression of such an i nquiry, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall notify the federal Office of Research Integrity and shall include in that notific a- tion a description of the reasons for termination of the i nquiry. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 204 UAB will make every effort to complete the inquiry wit h- in 60 days of its initiation. If the inquiry extends beyond 60 days, the reasons for the extension will be documented by the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer and will be retained with the record of the inquiry. The written report of the inquiry shall state what evidence was review ed, shall indicate the relevant expertise of the per- sons reviewing the evidence, shall summarize the relevant interviews, and shall include the conclusions of the inquiry. The ind ividual(s) against whom the allegation was made shall be given a copy of the inquiry report and shall have an oppor- tunity to make written comment regarding the report. This report, including a conclusion as to whether there is reaso na- ble cause to believe that misconduct has occurred, shall be forwarded to the Provost (with a copy t o the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer) through the appropr iate dean who should make whatever comment or recommendation is deemed war-ranted. 2. The Provost, with the advice and counsel of the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer and others as appropr iate, shal l decide whether to close the matter or to appoint an Investiga t- ing Committee. If findings from the inquiry provide sufficient basis for conducting an investigation, the investigation must be started within 30 days of compl etion of the inquiry. The written report of the inquiry will be made available to the I n- vestiga ting Committee. 3. If the Provost determines that it is not necessary to u n- dertake an investigation, the Provost will report to the Pres i- dent the reasons for this decision and the findings of the i n- quiry. The report will be maintained in a secure manner for at least three years by the Office of the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. Investigation. For purposes of this policy, \"investig ation\" means the formal examination and evaluation by a committee of all relevant facts to determine if scientific mis conduct has occurred. 1. The Investigating Committee is appointed by the Pr ov- ost and will elect its own chairperson. Members of the Co m- mittee shall consist of at least three tenured fa culty members who have the expertise to deal with technical aspects of the activ ities in question. At least two of these faculty members must be from outside the suspected individual's department. The Provost shall take precautions not to appoint any commi t- tee member who h as a real or apparent conflict of interest with the outcome of the inve stigation. The chairperson shall conduct meetings of the Investiga t- ing Committee as frequently as required in order to determine whether or not the activities in question do in deed cons titute misconduct. All such meetings and the deliber ations thereof shall be held in confidence to protect the affected individual or individuals. Those accused of misconduct shall be given a written summary of the charges and supporting evidence and shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Commi t- tee to comment on allegations. The accused may be represented by counsel. The Office of Counsel shall be kept informed of the investigation process and shall advise the I n- vestigating Committee concernin g proc edural matters. The Committee should take no more than 60 days to complete its review and to prepare its report for submi ssion to the President. UAB will make every effort to complete all investigative matters within 120 days from initiation of the investigation. This includes the work of the committee, pr e-paring the report, submitting the report to the President, ma k- ing the report available for comment by the subject(s) of the investigation, and submitting the final report to the federal Office of Re search I ntegrity. If the investigation cannot be completed within 120 days, the UAB Scientific Integrity O f- ficer shall request an extension from the federal Office of R e- search Integrity. The extension request will include an expl a- nation for the delay, an i nterim report on progress to date, an outline of what remains to be done, and an estimated date of completion. If UAB plans to terminate an investigation for any reason prior to completion of the normal progression of such an i n- vestiga tion, the UAB Scienti fic Integrity Officer shall notify the federal Office of Research Integrity of UAB's plan to ter- minate the investigation and shall include a description of the reasons for such te rmination. 2. The President, based on the Investigating Committee's findings and responses to those findings, shall dete rmine what actions are appropriate. Appropriate actions may include di s- charge from employment at UAB or expulsion from UAB in the case of a student. Such actions shall be consistently a p- plied throughout UAB. The P resident will notify the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer who in turn will work with the O f- fice of Grants and Contracts Administr ation to notify any agencies or foundations supporting the research in question and any journals or other publications which ma y have been affected by the publ ication of results of that research. 3. The UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall submit the report of the investigation to the federal Office of R esearch Integrity and shall include in that report the policies and pr o- cedur es under which the investigation was conducted, how and from whom information was obtained relevant to the i n- vestigation, the findings of the invest igation, and the basis of the findings. Also included will be a description of any san c- tions taken by UAB and the actual text of, or an accu rate summary of, the views of any individual(s) found to have e n- gaged in scientific misco nduct. Additional Notifications 1. If the Provost initiates a formal investigation, any agency or foundation supporting the research in question shall be notified by the Director of the Office of Grants and Co n- tracts Administration upon receipt of information from the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. Any such agency or found a- tion shall be notified imm ediately if it is ascertained at any time during the initial inquiry or subsequent investigation that there is an immediate health haz ard involved; an immediate need to protect federal funds or equipment; an immediate need to protect the interests of the persons making the alleg ations, the individuals who are the subject of the allegations, or any co-investigators and associates, if any; a probability that the alleged incident is going to be publicly reported; or a possibi li- ty that criminal violation has occurred. The agen cies also will be given interim reports of any investigation should the ci r- cumstances warrant. 2. If the initial inquiry or the subsequent investigation i n- dicates that the allegations are unsubstanti ated, UAB will make diligent efforts to restore the reputation of those accuse d at UAB, with any involved funding agencies and els ewhere. 3. Any involved funding agencies shall be notified of the final outcome of any investiga tion. Addition to UAB Catalog: Undergraduate Pr ograms UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 205 Until the next printing of the UAB Catalog: Undergr a- duate Programs, the following two sentences are added as the second and third sentences in the second par agraph of the \"Academic Conduct\" section on page 22 of the 1996- 1997 edition of that catalog: \"A student may be expelled on the first offense. Students s hould con sult the policies of the school in which they are enrolled to determine the circumstances under which expulsion can occur with a first o ffense.\" Attachment The form entitled \"Scientific Misconduct Allegation R e- view Checklist\" as attached to this p olicy is to be used as a guideline and summary of documentation related to reviews of allegations of violations of this policy. The form may be r e- vised from time to time without affecting the policy itself. The SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT ALLEGATION REVIEW CHECK LIST can be found online at www.iss.uab.edu/Pol/HiEthicsMtab.pdf or may be ob tained from the Graduate School or the UAB Scientific Integrity O f- ficer. Appendix VI: Graduate School Policy Concernin g Student Participation in Proprietary Research August 8, 2000 Faculty, staff, and students of a university create, di sse- minate, and apply knowledge for the benefit of society. When faculty of the university are involved in r esearch, some of which may be o f a proprietary nature, particular care must be taken to ensure that the need for graduate students to pub licly present and publicly defend the results of their th esis or disse r- tation research is not co mpromised. Grad uate st udent advisors, graduate program directors, and graduate students the mselves, therefore, share in the r espons ibility to ensure that graduate students do not become involved in thesis or di ssertation r e- search that is, or has the p otential to become, propri etary if partic ipation in that r esearch will etion of their degree r equirements or nega tively effect their pro ductivity of future employabi lity. The po licy of the Graduate School and university is that a faculty member or a graduate student cannot enter an agree- ment that preve nts or significantly d elays the presentation or publication of research r esults. Journal publication delays not exceeding three months are acceptable, but publication of Ph.D. di ssertation materials through University Microfilms is a requirement of the Graduate School and, thus, cannot be delayed. In instances where, despite good faith efforts on the part of the graduate student advisor, the graduate program director, and the graduate student, the gra duate student's thesis or di s- sertation research is later found to be of a proprietary nature, the Graduate Dean will be notified immediately. The Graduate School Dean, in turn, will immediately convene a meeting of the graduate student, the graduate advisor, the involved grad u- ate program d irector, an$ members o f the student's thesis or dissertation committee. This group, in consultation with the Vice President for Research and/or the Executive Director of the R esearch Fou ndation, will resolve the problem. If the situation cannot be resolved through the efforts of this group, a ruling will be made by the appropriate Vice Pre s- ident for Health or Ac ademic Affairs. Appendix VII: Drug -Free Campus Policy For St udents www.iss.uab.edu/Pol/DrugcampDtab.pdf Dece mber 14, 1991 (Replaces policy dated September 26, 1990.) NOTE: See also the following related policies: Drug -free Workplace Policy; Drug Screening Policy for Student At h- letes; School of Medicine \"Policy on Impairment and Chem i- cal Substance Abuse\"; School of Dentistry \"Policy on I m- pairment and Chemical Substance Abuse\"; School of Nursing \"Policy on Impairment and Chemical Su bstance Abuse.\" Policy Statement This policy is applicable to all students enrolled in credit course(s) or degree -granting programs a t the Un iversity of Alabama at Birmingham and to all students receiving ac adem- ic credit at UAB (other than for contin uing education units) for study in a program in a foreign coun try conducted by UAB alone or in conjunction with a fo reign university. Unla wful possession, use, manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of illicit drugs, controlled substances, or alcoholic beverages by any UAB student on UAB pro perty or as part of any UAB -sponsored or UAB -sanctioned activity is prohibited. The legal possession , use, or distribution of alcoholic beve rag- es on UAB property or at UAB -sponsored or UAB -sanctioned activities is governed by the UAB General Policy Regarding the Use and Co nsumption of Alcoholic Beverages and appl i- cable local, state, and fed eral laws. In certain situations, the University is required to report the activities prohibited by this policy to appropriate law e n- forcement authorities. In all cases, the University may report activities prohibited by this policy to appropriate law e n- forcement autho rities if it appears that the activity is a viola- tion of law. Disciplinary Actions. Violations of this policy constitute nonacademic misconduct and will be subject to estab lished disciplinary action for nonacademic misconduct in accordance with stipulatio ns in the Direction Student Handbook or other applicable procedures. Violations of this policy by students should be reported to the appropr iate student affairs office or other office handling student nonacademic misconduct in the same manner in which othe r instances of nonacademic mi s- conduct are r eported. In some cases of violation of this policy for unlawful use, a student may be given, at the discretion of the Uni versity, the option to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug or a l- cohol abuse assi stance or rehabilitation program in lieu of dismissal. Participation in such an assistance or rehabilitation program is at the expense of the student. Drug -free Awareness Program. At least annually, UAB shall inform students of the dangers of drug and a lcohol abuse on campus, of the existence of this policy statement and its penalties for violations, and of available drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation, and assistance through the follo w- ing activi ties: -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 206 1. Publication, at least annually, of this policy in appr o- priate student publications and distribution to st udents in UAB's foreign programs and to students in programs con- ducted in conjunction with foreign univers ities; 2. Inclusion of this policy in future editions of st udent class sch edules and/or registr ation mate rials, stu dent han d- books, and student cat alogs; 3. Dissem ination of this policy and of inform ation at stu- dent orientation and assis tance pr ograms regarding the dangers of drug and a lcohol use and abuse and available rehabilitation programs ; and 4. Continuation, and expansion, of the UAB drug and a l- cohol awareness program which includes spo nsorship of the \"Alcohol/Drug Awareness Week\" and publication of pa mph- lets and other materials. Applicability to Other Policies. Other drug -free policies created to cover specific areas of the Univer sity may be more restrictive than this policy but may not be less r estrictive. At a minimum, other such policies must include, or reference, the provisions of this policy. V iolators will be subject to the pr o- visions of the more stringent po licy but will not be punished under more than one policy for the same o ffense. This policy does not revoke or otherwise interfere with policies in the health professional schools d esigned to dete r- mine whether health care professionals are i mpaired and to offer r ehabilitation, subject to the above provisions. The wording in the \"Non -academic Conduct\" sec tion of the Direction student handbook which relates to causes of dismissal due to the use, possession, etc. of illicit drugs, co n- trolled substances, or alcoholic beverages references only cer-tain provisions of this more exte nsive policy. The e ntire policy is applicable in all cases even if the policy it self is not printed in full. Attachments. The \"Applicable Legal Sanctions,\" \" Drug and Alcohol Use Health Risks,\" and \"Drug and Alcohol Cou n- seling, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Pr ograms\" attached to this policy are a part of the policy but may be revised from time to time without affecting the po licy itself. Effective Date and Imp lementation. This policy is effe c- tive immediately upon its being signed by the Pres ident. The offices of the appropriate Vice Presidents are respo n- sible for the development and maintenance of proc edures to implement this policy within their areas of respo nsibi lity. In addition to being distributed to students on the UAB campus, this policy will be distributed to students in UAB's foreign programs and to students in programs conducted in conjunction with foreign universities. The Vice President for Student Affairs is responsible for all distributions to students covered by this pol icy. Attachment A \"Applicable Legal Sanctions\" December 14, 1991.

A d- ditional State penalties and sanctions may apply. Attachment A, Continued Summary of State Penalties and Sanctions Under Alabama law, the pos session, purchase, or co n- sumption of alcoholic beverages by a person un der 21 years of age is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and by up to three months in jail. Also under Alabama law, for a first offense, unlawful possession of a controlled substance ( that is, illegal drugs) may be punished by impriso nment up to ten years and a $5,000 fine and unlawful distribution of controlled substances may be punished by imprisonment up to 20 years and a $10,000 fine. Subs equent offenses may carry more stringent sentences. Drug -Free Schools and Co mmunities Act Illegal drug and alcohol use, consumption, distribution, etc. on college and university campuses also are covered by the prov isions of the United States Drug -Free Schools and Commun ities Act Amendment of 1989 ( Public Law 101- 226). Legal Sanctions in Foreign Countries -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 208 Students in a program in a fo reign country conducted by UAB alone or in conjunction with a foreign uni versity also may be subject to sanctions under foreign law or under the Uniform Code of Militar y Justice. Although the legal san c- tions d escribed in this policy under United States law may not apply to students in a foreign country, UAB will ne vertheless hold such students to the same standards as students within the United States and will take the d isciplinary a ctions described in this policy for violations of these sta ndards. Attachment B \"Drug and Alcohol Use Health Risks\" December 14, 1991 General Although there has been recent change in American health habits and societal attitudes toward recreational drug and alcohol use, problems continue to exist and experiment a- tion is starting at an earlier age. An important piece of info r- mation to surface in recent years is that even moderate, no n- prescribed use of alcohol and nonpr escribed use of drugs can have an adverse effect on overall health and well -being. Co n- sider the follo wing facts: Drinking more than one or two alcoholic beverages a week promotes more visible signs of a ging; Consuming one and one -half or more alcoholic beverages per day increases th e risk of breast can cer; Drinking alcoholic beverages poisons the heart muscle, counteracts the benefits of exercise, increases male impotence, and depresses the body's immune sy stem; Tobacco use is a contributing factor in the development of chronic bron chitis, emphysema, circulatory problems, and coronary disease, as well as b eing the leading cause of lung cancer; Cocaine use is responsible for kidney damage, stroke, lung and heart diseases, seizures, and intense psychological problems. Many forms of nar cotics are highly addictive to u sers. Marijuana use creates certain dysfunctions related to thinking, learning, and recall; aggravates asthma, bro nchitis, and emphysema; contributes to fertility problems; and co ntri- butes to the development of lung ca ncer; The nonprescribed use of tranquilizers, barbiturates, and amphetamines is dangerous and may cause major health pro b- lems, i ncluding death; Extended drug and/or alcohol use may result in substance dependency and loss of control of an individual's life.

Attachment B.1 Alcohol -Effects (55 Federal Reg ister 33591) Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coo rdination r equired to drive a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be in volved in an accident. Low UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 209 to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental func tions, severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other de- pressants of the central nervous sy stem, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just d escribed. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, ha llucinations, and con vulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life -threatening. Long- term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, partic u- larly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver. Mothers who drin k alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol sy ndrome. These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retard a- tion. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than oth er youngsters of becoming alcoho lics. Uses and Effects of Controlled Substances See Attachment B.2 for additional information concer ning health risks involved in drug use. Attachment C \"Drug and Alcohol Counseling, Treatment, and Rehabil i- tation Programs\" December 14, 1991 [This page revised August 5, 1998] Student Services The Campus Assistance Program is designed to address the following issues: continued longitudinal needs asses s- ments, ca mpus community awareness, enlistment of support from all campus segm ents, identification of high -risk students, early intervention, development of peer counseling and sup- port groups, and referral to on/off ca mpus resources and treatment facilities when indicated. The following are on - campus programs available to st udents: Campus Assistance Program Wellness Center Hill University Center -Suite 460 934-5816 UAB Mental Health Services Center for Psychiatric Medicine 1713 Sixth Avenue, South Birmingham, Alabama 35294- 0018 ACCESS line 934 -7008 UAB Substance Abuse Program 401 Beac on Parkway West Birmingham, Alabama 35209 917-3733 Other non -UAB, off -campus services are available in the Birmingham area and in many of the foreign countries in which UAB conducts programs of study.

Appendix VIII: Immunization Policy www.iss.uab.edu/Pol/ImmunizItab.pdf March 20, 2002 Introduction The American College Health Association recommends that students be immunized against certain diseases. Ther e- fore, UAB hereb y establishes this policy on imm unization. For purposes of this policy, immunization against Rube o- la (Red Measles) includes an initial vaccine plus a sec ond dose of vaccine (see below). First-time Entering UAB Students All first -time entering students born on or after January 1, 1957, who enroll in credit courses on UAB's main campus must show proof of immunization against Rubeola (Red Measles). (Two doses are required for proof of previous i m- munization: dose 1 must have been given at 12 months after birth or later, and Dose 2 must have been given after 1980.) Enrol ling students must show proof of these immunizations with either an official certificate of immunization, a photocopy of an immunization certificate, or written documentation from their physician. If the person has never been immunized, two injections of the vaccine at least one month apart are required. International Students and International Scholars Because of the disparity of immunization requirements among many foreign countries, all UAB inte rnational students and international scholars are required to be immunized against Tetanus, diptheria, Mumps, Rubeola (Red Measles), and Rubella (German Measles). In lieu of being re- immunized, such individuals may present proof of having had such immuniza tions. If they do not have such proof or have not been immunized, they must be immunized against these diseases prior to attending, enrolling, or participating in UAB academic, research, observing, or clinical programs and activ i- ties. Furthermore, all inte rnational students and international scholars must show proof of a non- reactive Tuberculin skin test (or appropriate treatment if positive) within three months prior to enrollment or visiting. Individuals who have a history of reactive Tuberculin skin test ing must provide a current chest X -ray (taken since their last reactive skin test but within three months prior to enrollment or visitng) indicating that the person currently is clear of Tuberculosis. Students Enrolled in Health -related Schools Because of the nature of their work, students engaged in health professional training programs could have a higher risk of contracting Rubeola, Mumps, Tetanus, Di ptheria, Varicella (Chickenpox), Tuberculosis, and Hepatitis B. Therefore, all UAB students in the Joint Health Sciences programs and in the Schools of Medicine, Den tistry, Optometry, Public Health, Nursing, and Health Related Professions are required to be immunized against Tetanus, Diptheria, Varicella erman Measles), and Hepatitis B. In lieu of being re- immunized, such individuals may present proof of having had such immuniz a- tions. Proof must be either official medical documentation or certificates of immunization or positive titer. If students do not have such proof or have not been immunized, they must begin the immunization process against these diseases prior to being admitted, attending, enrolling, or participating in UAB ac a- demic, research, or clinical pr ograms and activities. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 210 Students completing their Hepatitis B series of vaccines must obtain Hepatitis B titer 1 to 2 months after their third vaccine to see if additional boosters are necessary. If the titer is negative, students will be given the option either to repeat the entire Hepatitis B serie s or to take 1 to 2 Hepatitis B \"booster\" shots to try to attain a positive titer. Students who have completed their Hepatitis B vaccine series prior to m atri- culation are required to take a Hepatitis B titer prior to pa rtici- pating in a clinical environment to see if additional boos ters or labs are required. All students enrolled in health -related schools must have had a Tuberculin skin test with negative results (or appropriate treatment if positive) within three months prior to matricul a- tion. Students part icipating in clinical environments with p a- tients will be required to obtain a two -step Tuberculin skin test before starting clinical rota tions and are mandated to renew their Tuberculin one -step skin test once per year. General The UAB Student Health Servi ce will provide such i m- munizations and titer testing on a fee -for-service basis for any student who needs to meet his or her UAB i mmunization or titer requirements. Students may choose to fulfill these r e- quirements at the Jefferson County Health Department or with a private physician. Individual UAB schools may impose additional immuni- zation requirements as needed for their students. Exceptions Exceptions to this policy will be made only for those st u- dents who can document medical or religious contraindic a- tions to the vaccine. Such documentation must be submitted to the appropriate admissions or registration office as indicated in the procedures to implement this policy. Implementation The Provost (in conjunction with the Vice Pres i- dent/Dean, School of Medicine and the Assistant Vice Pres i- dent for Enrollment Services and University Registrar) is r e- sponsible for procedures to implement this policy for students in the Joint Health Sciences programs and in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Optometry, Public He alth, Nursing, and Health Related Professions. The Vice President for Student Affairs (in conjunction with the Assistant Vice President for Enrollment Services and University Registrar and the Associate Vice President for Enrollment Management) is responsi ble for procedures to i m- plement this policy for all other UAB students. Appendix IX: Computer Software Copying And Use Policy July 13, 1999 (Replaces policy entitled \"Computer Software Copying Po li- cy\" dated June 1, 1994.) See also the following related po licies: \"Computer Software Policy\" [Software Policy\" in the You and UAB Handbook for A d- ministrative, Professional, and Support Personnel Introduction Respect for the intellectu al work of others is a tradition at UAB. UAB values the free exchange of ideas but not plagi ar-ism or the unauthorized copying of computer software, i nclud- ing programs, applications, and data. Under the federal cop y- right law, it is illegal to make a copy of computer sof tware except for archival or back -up purposes without the pe rmis- sion of the copyright holder. Therefore, unauthorized cop ying of computer software or its documentation is illegal, and, if discovered, ind ividuals and institutions who break this law can be liable for substantial damages. The person respo nsible may be held l iable. All state and federal laws and UAB policies must be a d- hered to in the use of UAB's computer equipment and sys- tems. Any use of UAB equipment that violates cop yright law or licensure contracts, that compromises or attempts to co m- promise the integrity of UAB -based or any other computers or computer systems, or that involves gambling or other illegal activity also is forbidden and may subject the computer user to criminal, ci vil, and/or UAB sanctions. Any use of UAB's software, including shareware, must comply with all copyright laws and with the terms of the license granted by the software owner, includ ing any prohibitions against simultaneous use on multiple computers. Unauthorized use or copying of any sof t- ware (whether or not owned by UAB) is not permitted on any UAB equipment. This policy covers computer software which has been purchased by, acquired by, donated to, and/or licensed to, UAB and includes software that is bun dled with, or preloaded on, computer systems purchased by UAB. It also includes software downloaded from networks (including the Internet), and in those instances it is important for UAB users and d e- partments/units to ensure that any such commercial softwa re or shareware may legally be downloaded, that the software is freeware, or that the software is in the public domain. UAB and individuals must comply with all terms and conditions of software downloaded from networks, including the Inte rnet. If computer software carries a UAB copyright, it may be used and distributed by UAB as long as such distribution is in keeping with the desires of the originating d epartment/unit and is not in violation of the \"Computer Software Policy.\" If a UAB determination of inte rest in li censing the software is pending, the software would be considered non -UAB software for the purposes of this policy until such time that UAB d e- termines its interest in licensing the software. This policy does not alter the cat egories of software a nd the rights pertaining thereto as indicated in the UAB \"Computer Sof tware Policy.\" Definitions For purposes of this policy, the following definitions a p- ply: \"Computer software\" includes, but is not limited to, pu r- chased or commercial software, sound, graphics, i mages, or datasets; shareware; freeware; and electronically stored doc u- mentation and the media that hold it. Not included in the def i- nition as used in this policy are noncop yrighted computer data files that have no significance beyond the individua l or d e- partment/unit. \"UAB software\" is defined as computer software pu r- chased or acquired by a UAB department or unit or by a UAB employee as part of his or her role at UAB. It includes sof t- ware donated to UAB or software purchased by related fou n- dations and donated for use by UAB. It includes computer programs written by UAB employees or students if creating such software is a UAB -associated ef fort. UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 211 \"Non -UAB software\" is defined as computer software purchased, acquired, or created by an individual(s) and not officially acquired by a UAB depar tment or unit. \"UAB -associated efforts\" (related to computer software development) is defined relative to the UAB \"Computer Sof t- ware Policy\" UAB -assigned e f- forts. Policy Statement It is the policy of the University of Alabama at Birmin g- ham to comply with copyright law and license agreements entered into with vendors or authors of computer software. No illegally obtained or illegally copied (often referred to as \"p i- rated\") computer software i s allowed at UAB. UAB does not, and will not, condone illegal cop ying of computer software or the use of illegally copied or obtained computer software. A n- yone connected with UAB who causes unauthorized co mputer software to be installed or loaded in connec tion with his or her role at UAB or who acquires unauthorized computer software in connection with his or her role at UAB is in viola tion of this policy. Whenever a staff member, faculty member, contractor of services to UAB, student, or visitor to the cam pus, in conne c- tion with his or her role at UAB, receives a copy of computer software from UAB, requests software to be loaded or i n- stalled on a UAB computer, or loads or installs co mputer software on a UAB computer, he or she must abide by the stipulations included in the license agreements associated with that computer software. It is the responsibility of anyone r e- questing installation of, or installing or loading, computer software onto a UAB co mputer to be familiar with the license agreements for that c omputer software, as documented by the vendor. Individual employees are accountable for software they load or install on UAB computers or which they supply for loading or installing on the department's or unit's com put- ers or networks. They also are account able for any existing software on UAB computers over which they have co ntrol. The installation or use of non -UAB software on UAB computers is prohibited unless approved in writing by the de- partment/unit head. The department/unit head may choose to give bla nket permission to an individual on a per -machine basis. The non- UAB software should be free of viruses or ot h- er destructive mechanisms to the great est extent possible and must be used for legitimate UAB purposes directly related to UAB's instruction, rese arch, and service activ ities. Taking UAB -owned computer software home or els e- where off campus to use on a non- UAB computer, even if the purpose is to perform UAB -related work, also is prohibited unless such use is authorized in writing and is permitted in the license agreement associated with the computer software. This const itutes theft of UAB property unless the software license specifically allows concurrent use and such use has been a p- proved in writing by one's supervisor or depar tment/unit head. If the software license does not allow such use and a depar t- ment/unit requests an employee to perform such work, the department/unit should purchase a separate copy of the sof t- ware for installation on the employee's co mputer. A computer lab or a department/unit with publicly acce ss- ible computers which allows non -UAB software to be i n- stalled temporarily on the network or computers for purposes such as completing class assignments, printing doc uments, converting document formats, etc., must have documented procedu res in place for removing any non- UAB software i n-stalled on the computers. This practice is not considered a violation of this policy as long as use of the non- UAB sof t- ware on such UAB computers is directly related to UAB's instruction, research, and servi ce activ ities. Proof of Ownership of Software Computer software purchased by, and/or licensed to, UAB is an institutional resource and, therefore, should be s a- feguarded and accounted for in the same manner as other UAB resources. All commercial computer so ftware license agreements, r ecords of purchase, and original and back -up disks (or other software distribution media) must be kept by the department/unit in a safe place and must be made avai lable for review or inspection. All license or use agreements for shareware or freeware computer software also must be avai la- ble for inspection. Likewise, any written authorizations for the use of UAB -owned software on non -UAB computers must be available for inspection. The following are examples of documents which can be used to show ownership or right to use software: The dated purchase order, invoice, or sales receipt for purchased software or proof of a site -license agreement cover- ing all copies in use or accessible by users in the depar tment. The original software d istribution media. The original documentation. For software that is bundled with, or preloaded on, co m- puter systems purchased by UAB, an itemized listing of the software on the dated purchase order, i nvoice, or sales receipt for the computer. For software downloaded from external networks or a c- quired from noncommercial sources, a statement ind icating the nature of the software (for example, downloadable co m- mercial software, shareware, freeware, or public domain), the use and registration requirements for t he software, and proof of regi stration of the software, when applicable. Acquisition of software universally known to be available free to educational institutions and/or to the general public does not have to be documented. (Note: Examples of statements t o document l e- gality of downloaded software include, but are not limited to, receipts for payment of shareware registration, printed co pies of e-mail messages if the user is required to e- mail the author, screen prints of the status of freeware or public do main sof t- ware, etc.) It is recognized that the extent of docu mentation needed for freeware or public domain software will not be as extensive as for other types of sof tware. These proofs of purchase/ownership must cover all copies in use or accessible by users in the depar tment. Software License Registration Registration with the author(s) or vendor(s) of computer software purchased by, or received from, UAB for install ation on a UAB computer in connection with one's role at UAB must include UAB or one's department/unit as the li censee. Applicability This policy applies to all staff, faculty, students, contra c- tors of services to UAB, and visitors. Disciplinary Action A violation of this policy by employees, including faculty, shall result in disciplinary ac tion according to established UAB disciplinary procedures up to, and inclu ding, discharge for nonfaculty employees and termination for cause for faculty employees. A violation of this policy by a student consti tutes nonacademic misconduct, and the student will be subject to established disciplinary action. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 212 Implementation The Vice President for Planning and Information Ma n- agement is responsible for overall procedures to i mplement this policy. The Executive Director of the UAB University Hospital is responsib le for specific procedures to cover i m- plementation in Hospital depar tments/units. Appendix X: Graduate Council August 8, 2000 The Graduate Council of UAB shall be constituted as fo l- lows: (a) the director, or designated represen tative, of each program in th e Graduate School91, (b) for grad uate students entirely under UAB jurisdiction, elected by the graduate st u- dents at large10; and (c) the Graduate School dean. The Grad u- ate School dean shall serve as the chair of the Graduate Cou n- cil. In the absence of the G raduate dean, the dean may desi g- nate a temporary chair. The Graduate Council shall meet as required, but at least once each regular term. Additional meet ings may be called by the Graduate dean. A minimum of fourteen (14) calendar days notice to all members is required for each meeting. Twenty - five percent of the Graduate Council members shall constitute a quorum. A member of the staff of the Graduate School shall be appointed by the Graduate School dean to record minutes of each meeting and be responsible f or distributing these m i- nutes to all members of the Graduate Council and others as deemed appropriate. The rules contained in Robert's Rules of Order (R evised) shall govern the Council in all cases which they are appl icable. Appendix XI: Ownership of Intel lectual Property Rights May 18, 2000 UAB recognizes that research and scholarship should be encouraged and carried out without regard to f inancial gain from licensing fees, royalties, or other such i ncome. However, UAB also recognizes that patentable inve ntions, discoveries, software programs, and other intelle ctual property often arise from UAB -related staff or faculty e fforts. The policies governing the administration of inventions are included in the Board of Trustees Rule 509. Other instit u- tional policies govern other forms of intellectual property i n- cluding computer software. Those policies also provide reco g- nition and incentive to inventors and at the same time ensure that UAB shares in the rights pe rtaining to inventions in which it has an investmen t. Any income accruing to UAB is used in the furtherance of its aca demic mission. Disclosure of discoveries and inventions which appear to have commercial value and/or utility should be made to the UAB Research Foundation. Any such invention or discovery (1) which is the result of research carried on by, or under the 9 The term \"program\" used above is to signify each approved graduate degree offering (as listed in the i nside front cover), without regard to the UAB unit responsible for its impleme n- tation. (Where there is more than one director for a pr ogram, there shall only be one vote.) 10 The elected student members ar e to be in good standing, enrolled and registered, each in a different pr ogram. direction of, any employee of the University and/or having the costs thereof paid from Unive rsity funds or from funds under the control of, or administered by, the Univer sity, or (2) which is made by an employee of the University and which relates to the inventor's field of work at the University, or (3) which has been developed in whole or in part by the utilization of r e- sources or facilities belonging to the University shall be a s- signed to th e Unive rsity. Therefore, employees or students may not themselves assign or grant any option to any such intellectual property developed during the course of their e m- ployment wit hout a release from UAB. Questions concerning intellectual property rights should be directed to the UAB Research Found ation. Appendix XII: Sexual Harassment Policy January 27, 1999 (Replaces policy dated April 17, 1996) Introduction The University of Alabama at Birmingham is firmly committed to providing an environment that is fr ee of di scrim- ination, including sexual harassment. Sexual ha rassment i n- cludes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual f avors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual n ature when (1) submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's emplo yment or academic evaluation, (2) submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for e m- ployment or academic deci sions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or of crea t- ing an intimidating or hostile working or educational env i- ronment. Such be havior may violate federal law and/or give rise to personal liability for the r esults of such behavior. Co n- sequently, UAB prohibits all forms of sexual harassment and will investigate complaints thoroughly and with the utmost seriousness. A violation of this policy may result in the taking of di s- ciplinary action up to, and including, discharge. Sexual Harassment in the Workplace It is a violation of UAB policy for any employee, inclu d- ing faculty, to engage in sexual harassment in the workplace or in work- related situations. Employees who believe that they have been sexually harassed b y a supervisor, co -worker, or other employee of UAB should report the incident promptly to the Human Resource Man agement Relations Office. Only Human Resource Management has the responsibility for coor- dinating and conducting an investigation of sexual ha rassment claims in the workplace and also for reco mmending corrective action to the UAB administration. Sexual Harassment in the Instructional Se tting UAB prohibits sexual harassment of students by the teaching staff or other employees of UAB. For pu rposes o f this policy, the term \"teaching staff\" means all those who teach at UAB and includes, but is not limited to, full -time f a- culty, part -time faculty, students functioning in teaching roles (such as graduate assistants), and academic admini strators. A studen t who believes that he or she has been sexually harassed should report the incident promptly to the Vice Pre s- ident for Student Affairs. Sexual harassment by a student is considered nonacademic misconduct, and the alleged st udent UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 213 offender will be subject to the disciplinary process co ntained in the Direction: Student Han dbook. Sexual Harassment -General Full and prompt reporting is necessary for effective i m- plementation of this policy, and UAB encourages such repor t- ing. However, UAB's duty to protect employee s and students exists when UAB's supervisory personnel know, or have re a- son to know, of unreported sexual harassment. Supervisors therefore are directed to take all ap propriate steps to prevent sexual harassment in their areas of responsibility and to take corrective action, including disci plinary action, in response to inappropriate behavior which may constitute sexual haras s- ment even in the a bsence of a complaint. This policy seeks to encourage students, staff, and faculty to express freely and responsib ly, through established proc e- dure, complaints of sexual harassment. All such complaints shall be treated as confidential information and shall be dis- closed only to those with a need to know as part of the invest i- gatory and resolution process. Any act of in terference, retali a- tion, or coercion by a UAB employee against a student or e m- ployee for using this policy interferes with such free expre s- sion and is itself a viola tion of this policy. Implementation This policy will be published regularly in the UAB R e- porter and in the Class Schedule. The policy will be i ncluded in revisions of handbooks relating to staff, faculty, and st u- dents. The Vice President for Financial Affairs and Admin is- tration is responsible for implementation of this policy as it relates to se xual harassment in the workplace. The Vice Pres i- dent for Student Affairs is responsible for implementation of this policy as it relates to sexual harassment in the instru ction- al setting. Appendix XIII: Policy Concerning Employee Falsification Of UAB R ecord s And Documents April 20, 1998 (Replaces \"Policy Concerning Falsification of UAB R ecords and Documents\" dated June 27, 1996.) See also the following related items: \"Policy Concerning the Maintenance of High Ethical Standards in Research and Other Scholarly Activities\" Regulations and proc edures governing faculty credentials Board of Trustees Board Rule 105 Owne r- ship and Preservation of Records and Files. NOTE: Falsification of documents and records by a st u- dent who is not functioning in a UAB employee capacity is considered nonacademic misconduct and is handled in acco r- dance with regulations covering nonacademic misconduct. See Direction Student Han dbook. Introduction As a health -care, research, and educational institution, the University of Alabama at B irmingham is acutely interested in issues relating to the integrity of its emplo yees. For purposes of this policy, falsification of records exists when a UAB employee is discovered to have provided false information on the employment application; to have f ailed to disclose requested information; knowingly to have falsified information; or knowingly to have recorded false information on any UAB document or record, regardless of format and including electronic communications. The following is a pa r- tial list o f infractions which are specifically prohibited: falsif y- ing information on an application for initial employment or for transfer; falsifying employee recruitment/credential records; falsifying employee expense account records or other rei m- bursement records ; falsifying personnel/payroll documents (including, but not limited to, pay records, time sheets, or ot h- er types of time records); clocking the time card/time r ecord of another employee or completing and submitting for approval the time sheet/time record of another employee; fal sifying health records or vacation/sick leave records; falsifying r e- search records, medical records, or departmental administr a- tive records; and falsifying student records (i ncluding, but not limited to, admissions a pplication mater ials, transcripts, grade sheets, registration documents, and student identification do c- uments). Policy Statement Falsification of UAB records or documents is prohibited. Any knowing or negligent misrepresentation of a m aterial fact or any failure to make a complete disclosure of any requested information are causes for immediate discharge without notice or pay in lieu of notice for nonfaculty employees or termin a- tion for cause for faculty e mployees. Any exception to the immediate and automatic discharge of nonfaculty employees for these reasons must be ap proved in writing by the Associate Vice President for Human Resource Management. Any excep-tion to the recommendation of termination for cause for fac ul- ty for these reasons must be approved in writing by the Pr ov- ost and by the Associate Vice President for Human Resource Management. Implementation The Office of the Vice President for Financial Affairs and Administration is responsible for procedures to i mplement this policy as it relates to employee or depar tmental administrative records. The Office of the Provost is responsible for proc e- dures to implement this policy as it relates to academic records, research records, or faculty recruitment/credential records. Appendix XIV: Health Care Policy For International Students And Scholars May 1, 2000 (Replaces policy dated February 12, 1997) See also UAB Immunization Policy. Introduction The purpose of this policy is to ensure that international students and scholars have appropriate health -care opportun i- ties and health insurance coverage while they are enrolled as UAB students or are participating in UAB activ ities. Students/Scholars Covered by this Policy 1. All UAB degree -seeking international students, regar d- less of courseload, school, or degree program, must part icipate in the UAB Student Health Service and must have ad equate health insurance coverage. 2. All transient and temporary international students must have a dequate health insurance co verage. Those students may use the services of the UAB Student Health S ervice on a fee- for-service basis. -UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 214 3. International scholars who participate in activities at UAB for longer than four weeks should be encouraged to pa r- ticipate in the UAB Student Health Service and must have adequate health insurance coverage. Internatio nal scholars here for four weeks or less who do not participate in the UAB Student Health Service may use the services of Student Health on a fee -for-service basis. The inviting UAB department will be offered the opportunity to accept responsibility for th e fee- for-service charges incurred. If the department does not wish to pay the fee -for-service bills, the intern ational scholar will be responsible for the bills. Definitions For purposes of this policy, the following definitions a p- ply: \"Transient internat ional students\" are defined as intern a- tional students who are in the United States under the author i- zation of another institution or organization but who are taking cours ework at UAB. \"Temporary international students\" are defined as intern a- tional students who are taking less than a full -time course of study at UAB and who are not pursuing an official UAB d e- gree or certif icate. \"Adequate health insurance\" is defined as fo llows: a. Insurance provided through the UAB Student Health Service, OR b. Equivalent personal health insurance, the evidence for which must be shown to, and verified by, the UAB St udent Health Service. Implementation The Vice President for Student Affairs is responsible for procedures to implement this policy. Appendix XV: Policy Concernin g AIDS and HIV Infe ction April 24, 1998 (Replaces \"Policy Concerning AIDS and AIDS -related Cond i- tions\" dated September 21, 1989) NOTE: See also UAB University Hospital policies concerning prevention of transmission of HIV infe ctions. Definitions The follo wing are definitions or explanations of terminol- ogy used in this policy: AIDS -Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome occurs in someone with HIV infection when one or more of certain di s- eases or infections occurs or when a CD4 (also known as T4 helper) ly mphocy te cell count is below 200. HIV- Human immunodeficiency virus (the virus which causes AIDS). HIV antibody -A protein in the body produced in r esponse to infection with HIV. (There are tests which look for HIV antibody in a person infected with HIV.) HIV infe ction -A condition involving asymptomatic (without symptoms) or symptomatic (with symptoms) stages of infe ction. Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus which causes the disease, AIDS. Infection with that virus damages the human body's immune (defense) system and allows life- threatening infections to develop. HIV has no known cure or vaccine for prevention. Available medical knowledge ind i- cates that transmission of HIV is primarily through sexual contact or sharing intravenous drug parap hernalia with som e- one who has an HIV infection. It also can be spread from an infected mother to her baby before, or during, delivery and through breast feeding. HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as sharing food or drink, touching sur fac- es, shaking hands, dry kissing, or working together. HIV ca n- not be transmitted by mo squitoes or other insects. Even if there are no symptoms, an HIV -infected person can transmit HIV to a sexual partner or to a needle- sharing partner. Because of the seriou sness of the HIV/AIDS issue, the University of Alabama at Birmingham has established this policy which focuses on prevention (through detailed educ a- tion of students, faculty, and staff) and on the compa ssionate care of people with infection or AIDS. A supe rvisor or anyone in the UAB community who be- comes aware of an HIV/AIDS -related situation involving an employee, student, or visitor shall follow the guidelines stated in this po licy. Policy Statement 1. Admissions or Employment The University of Alabama at Birmingham accepts ot h- erwise -qualified individuals presenting themselves for admi s- sion or employment, irr espective of their HIV status. 2. Handicapping Conditions Persons with AIDS (and, possibly, those with other m a- nifestations of HIV infection) will be considered as having handicapping conditions as defined in the Rehabil itation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In determin- ing policy and in making related decisions, UAB off icials shall properly attend to the legal rights of these indiv iduals and shall make reasonable accommodations as are appropriate for individuals with handicapping cond itions. Decisions regarding the continuation of employment of faculty and staff with HIV infection or AIDS will be made on the b asis of job -related cri teria. Within current UAB policies and procedures, individuals may be reassigned to accomm o- date a disabling condition. Termin ation will be pursued only when the employee, even with re asonable reassignment of responsibilities, can no longer perform the duti es and respo n- sibilities of his or her pos ition. Any such termination action will be taken in accordance with established UAB proce dures. 3. Student Attendance UAB students who have HIV infections, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, will be allo wed regular clas s- room attendance as long as they are physically and mentally able to attend classes as determined by current UAB academic standards. HIV -infected students enrolled in UAB health pr o- fession schools may have their educational program modified by their school to limit the risk of disease transmission, in a c- cordance with the Alabama Infected Health -care Worker Manag ement Act. 4. Access to Facilities There will be no unreasonable restriction of access on the basis of HIV infection to student or e mployee facilities, the a- ters, restaurants, snack bars, gymnasiums, swimming pools, saunas, recreational facilities, or other common ar eas. 5. Student Housing Currently available medical information does not in dicate that there exists a risk of transmission of infection by casual UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 - 215 contact which would preclude sharing a residence with a per- son with AIDS or HIV infection. However, there may be re a- sonable concern for the health of students with immune def i- ciencies (of any origin) when those students might be exp osed to certain contagious diseases (for example, measles or chick- en pox) in a close living situation. For these reasons, decisions regarding housing and private rooms for students with HIV infections will be made on a case- by-case basis by UAB St u- dent Hou sing and Residential Life officials. It is the respo nsi- bility of the student to make his/her HIV status known to UAB in order for any accommodation request to be consi dered. It also is the responsibility of an HIV -infected student to take necessary precaut ions to avoid exposure of others to i nfection through known means of tran smission. 6. Self -disclosure In general, students, student applicants, employees, and applicants for employment at UAB will not be asked to r e- spond to questions concerning the existe nce of HIV infection. However, both students and employees with HIV infection are encouraged to inform campus health -care providers so that UAB may pr ovide information about proper medical care, medical care availability, support, counseling, and education . This, like any other medical information, will be handled in a strictly confidential ma nner in accordance with established UAB policy and Al abama law. 7. Immunizations Incoming students known to have HIV infection need not be exempted from UAB requiremen ts for nonlive virus vacc i- nations. However, because of potentially ser ious consequences for HIV -infected persons' receiving live virus vaccines, per- sons who are recommended to receive such imm unizations should consult the UAB Student Health Center or the J effer- son County Department of Health for current recommend a- tions. 8. Information, Testing, and Counseling A. Testing. Students or employees requesting HIV ant i- body testing will be referred to the Jefferson County Depar t- ment of Health. UAB University Hospital emplo yees also may receive such testing through the Employee Health Se rvices. B. Services. Counseling, information, and education are available through various UAB units including the St udent Health Service, the Division of Student Affairs, the Hospita l Employee Health Service, and the Office of Human Resource Management. These services cu rrently are made available to the students or employees at no cost and in a ccordance with the guidelines in each unit. 9. Confidentiality of Information. A. Standards No information concerning HIV infection or AIDS or their diagnoses will be provided to any third party other than an employee's immediate supervisor without the expressed written consent of the infected person. Medical information cannot be released to an y person, group, agency, insurer, e m- ployer, or institution without specific written consent of the patient or legal guardian, except as required by law. All dis- closures of diagnoses of HIV infection or AIDS to indi viduals functioning in supervisory roles m ust be treated as confide n- tial information. According to present law, UAB phys icians and other health -care providers are mandated to protect the confidentiality of medical information with exceptions being made only if the need arises to protect others in very specific, life-threatening circumstances. Also, di sclosure by persons other than health -care providers that an individual has HIV infection or AIDS may be considered an invasion of that indi- vidual's privacy. Situations in which disclosure will be made will be determined on a case- by-case basis in consultation with the chair of the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee and the O ffice of Counsel, if needed. B. Public Health Reporting Requirements UAB will observe the public health reporting requir e- ments of the Alabama State Department of Public Health. I n- dividuals known to have HIV infection will be r eported to the State Department of Public Health accor ding to prevailing statutes. C. \"Need to Know\" According to the American College Health Association, current medical information concerning HIV neither just ifies nor requires warning others of the presence of someone with HIV infection or AIDS. Given the absence of any ev idence of transmission of HIV by casual contact, there is no need or justification for warning individuals in the academic workplace, administrative officers, or instructors of the pre s- ence of such an ind ividual. Therefore, the number of people at UAB who will be aware of the existence and/or identity of students or e m- ployees who have HIV i nfection will be kept to an absolute minimum, both to protect the confidentiality and the privacy of the infected persons and to avoid the generation of unnece s- sary fear and anxiety among fac ulty, staff, and students. 10. Education Training requirements fo r employees deemed at -risk by the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee shall co nsist of sessions sufficient in number and depth to comply with pr e- vailing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reco m- mendations and \"Bloodborne Pathogens Sta ndards.\" In the absence of such guidelines, the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee shall determine educational standards. Records of AIDS education training for at -risk employees shall be main- tained in the appropriate UAB Human Resource Manag ement office. 11. Saf ety Precautions A. Personnel Since many people with HIV infection are not identified in advance, universal precautions as defined by the Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention and by the Occupational Saf e- ty and Health Administration will guide the proc edures for the handling of blood and body fluids con taining viable blood of any student, employee, or patient. Questions regar ding these safety guidelines should be directed to the Depar tment of O c- cupational Health and Safety, the Hospital E mployee Health Service, the Office of Human Resource Man agement, the Hospital Committee on Infections, or the UAB Biosafety Committee. Each unit has the responsibility for d eveloping department -specific directives and procedures. D epartments also have the responsibility for compliance monito ring and staff education to prevent the transmission of HIV infec tion. B. Equipment Manuals and procedures already in use at UAB cover the precautions which should be taken when handling infectious materials. Certain of those procedures are re- emphasized here especially as pertains to the transmission of HIV infection. UAB personnel will use disposable, si ngle-use needles and other equipment whenever such equipment will puncture the skin or mucous membranes of patients, employees, or st u--UAB Graduate School Catalog 2002- 2004 216 dents. Extreme caution should be exercised when handling sharp objects, particu larly in disposing of needles. All used needles should be placed in puncture -resistant containers des- ignated for this purpose. Needles should never be bent or r e- capped after us e. Any needles which are made to be re- used or other equipment that punctures skin or mucous membranes should be a ppropriately cleaned and sterilized before re- use. Blood- soaked articles should be placed in leak -proof bags with biohazard labels before bein g sent for reprocessing or disposal in accordance with established UAB infection co ntrol guidelines. C. Teaching Laboratories Laboratory courses requiring exposure to blood, such as biology courses in which blood is obtained by fi nger prick for typing or e xamination, should use disposable equipment, and no lancets or other blood- letting devices should be re -used or shared. No students, except those in health -care professions, should be r equired to obtain or process the blood of others. 12. Job Performance Faculty, staff, students, and all other persons affiliated with UAB shall perform the responsibilities of their positions irrespective of the HIV status of patients, st udents, or co- workers. Failure to comply with this policy will be considered a failure t o adequately perform the respons ibilities of one's position and may result in disciplinary action up to, and in-cluding, di scharge. 13. Behavior Risk UAB students, faculty, and staff with HIV infection or AIDS who are aware of the potential danger of their cond ition to others and who engage in behavior (while performing their employee -related or student -related activities) which threa tens the safety and welfare of others may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with established UAB disciplinary p ro- cedures and/or applicable law. Applicability to Other UAB AIDS Policies More specific, written guidelines and procedures are the responsibility of individual departments and may be deve l- oped, as needed, by department/unit heads. All unit policies must b e compatible with this UAB -wide policy and may not be in co nflict with it. Graduation Deadline Dates, 2002 -2004 These dates are subject to change.
