The ISDA Benchmarks Supplement was published in September 2018 and was primarily developed in response to requirements under the EU Benchmarks Regulation for certain contracts to reflect the actions parties will take if a referenced benchmark is materially changed or ceases to be provided. By incorporating the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement into the terms of relevant transactions, market participants will be able to ensure these events are taken into account in their contracts and specify the fallback arrangements that would apply. The ISDA Benchmarks Supplement covers a much broader range of benchmarks than ISDA's work to implement robust fallbacks to specific rates for certain interbank offered rates (IBORs), which is being undertaken at the request of the Financial Stability Board's Official Sector Steering Group. While two separate initiatives, the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement complements the IBOR fallback work, as it enables firms to agree interim fallback arrangements should an IBOR cease to exist before the IBOR fallbacks are implemented. The IBOR fallbacks will take precedence for relevant IBORs once implemented following an index cessation event. The ISDA Benchmarks Supplement also sets out triggers and fallbacks if a benchmark does not qualify for use in a relevant jurisdiction or qualification is subsequently suspended or withdrawn. The Protocol supports both a counterparty-by-counterparty and an all-counterparties approach, meaning parties are not obliged to incorporate the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement into transactions with all of their counterparties that adhere to the protocol unless they wish to do so. Entities that adhere to the protocol are also able to choose whether the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement should only apply to new transactions under existing Master Agreements or whether they also want it to apply to existing transactions. Until both parties elect for it to apply to their legacy transactions, the protocol will only apply to new transactions. Unlike some ISDA Protocols where amendments are effected solely by delivery of an adherence letter by each party, the 2018 Benchmarks Supplement Protocol requires that adherents must also exchange completed Questionnaires for amendments to be effective between them. Please refer to the two sets of \"Frequently Asked Questions\" and other educational materials (including links to webinars) set out on this page for more information on the background and substance of the Protocol and the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement. Adherence to the Protocol is open to ISDA members and non-members. Parties will pay a one-time fee of $500 to ISDA for each adherence to the Protocol. There will not be a cut-off date to the Protocol. ISDA does, however, reserve the right to designate a cut-off date by giving 30 days' notice on this webpage. ISDA will be holding a Symposium on the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement, including the ISDA 2018 Benchmarks Supplement Protocol on January 26 in Paris - [ [Agenda](https://www.isda.org/event/paris/isda-symposium-isda-2018-benchmarks-supplement-2019-01-23/#anchor-agenda)] | [ [Register](https://www.isda.org/event/paris/isda-symposium-isda-2018-benchmarks-supplement-2019-01-23/register/)] ISDA 2018 Benchmarks Supplement Protocol (Protocol) FAQs ISDA has prepared this list of frequently asked questions to assist in your consideration of the Protocol. Capitalized terms used in this FAQs have the meanings given to them in the Protocol or, absent any meaning given to them in the Protocol, have the meanings given to them herein. THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DO NOT PURPORT TO BE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A GUIDE TO OR AN EXPLANATION OF ALL RELEVANT ISSUES OR CONSIDERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOL. PARTIES SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR LEGAL ADVISERS AND ANY OTHER ADVISER THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE PRIOR TO USING OR ADHERING TO THE PROTOCOL. ISDA ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY USE TO WHICH ANY OF ITS DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION MAY BE PUT.

Further information on the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement can be found in the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement FAQs and webinars provided on the ISDA [website](https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2018-%20benchmarks-supplement-protocol/).
