Doctors allocated 300 patients with moderate to severe acute pain, to receive either acupuncture or intravenous morphine. Successful analgesia was defined as a drop in pain intensity of at least 50% from baseline. In the acupuncture group, a success rate of 92% was obtained, whereas the corresponding figure in the morphine group was 78%. Pain resolution time was 16 minutes in the acupuncture group, versus 28 minutes in the morphine group. Adverse effects were significantly fewer in the acupuncture group (4) compared with the morphine group (85). The authors conclude that acupuncture should be considered in today's increasingly complicated and polymedicated patients to avoid adverse drug reactions.

Clinicians in America have found acupuncture to be an acceptable and effective adjunctive technique for reducing pain and anxiety in the hospital accident and emergency department. In the pilot observational study, retrospective data for 14 months was used to identify 182 patients who had received acupuncture in addition to standard care in the emergency department of Abbott Northwestern Hospital, Minneapolis. Of these, 52% did not receive painkillers before or during their acupuncture treatment; their average reported decrease in pain was 2.4 points. This compared well with the average 2.8 point pain decrease in those patients who had received painkillers. Additionally though, there was a significant decrease in anxiety scores among the patients who had received acupuncture. ( [Acceptability, Adaptation, and Clinical Outcomes of Acupuncture Provided in the Emergency Department: A Retrospective Pilot Study.](http://painmedicine.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/02/24/pm.pnv114) Pain Medicine, online 25 February 2016.) Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, have shed some light on possible mechanisms behind acupuncture's ability to alleviate chronic pain. They believe it might re-normalise connectivity between key brain regions involved in pain perception. The team randomly allocated 44 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, into one of three groups: high dose acupuncture; low dose acupuncture (fewer needles); sham acupuncture. Each patient received six sessions over a one month period, and to monitor brain activity, three of these sessions were conducted with the patient lying in an fMRI scanner. The scans showed repeated acupuncture sessions changed the connectivity between key brain regions associated with pain learning, memory and chronification, resulting ultimately in the reinstatement of healthy communication between body and brain. Sham acupuncture failed to achieve this effect. The researchers conclude that these results have implications for the assessment of the efficacy of acupuncture treatment with regard to reversal of chronic pain disorders. ( [Repeated verum but not placebo acupuncture normalizes connectivity in brain regions dysregulated in chronic pain](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158215001722). NeuroImage: Clinical, September 2015.) A study undertaken at two emergency dental clinics in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil has shown acupuncture to be a useful method of pain control for patients with acute dental pain. A sample of 120 patients, aged between 18 and 90, awaiting emergency treatment, received one acupuncture session. Pain was reduced in all patients, going down from a mean 6.56 to 0.96 on a visual analogue scale.

A feasibility study undertaken at the Northern Hospital Emergency Department, Melbourne, Australia, shows that acupuncture can provide patients with effective relief from pain and nausea. The study drew on data from 400 people visiting the department with these symptoms. The acupuncture group comprised 200 patients who received usual care plus acupuncture. For comparison, retrospective data was gathered on 200 closely matched patients who had received usual care alone. A satisfaction score of 10/10 was given by 57% of patients receiving acupuncture; 52% responded \"definitely yes\" for their willingness to use it again, and a further 32% said \"probably yes\". Adverse events were rare and mild. Pain scores reduced from a mean 7.0 before acupuncture, to 4.7 afterwards. Nausea scores dropped from 2.6 to 1.4. Musculoskeletal conditions were most commonly treated, followed by abdominal or flank pain. The researchers conclude acupuncture in the emergency department appears safe and acceptable for patients with pain and/or nausea and that combined care may provide effective pain and nausea relief. Further studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the add-on effect of acupuncture are recommended.
