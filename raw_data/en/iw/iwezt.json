An M.D.'s responsibilities include treatment and care of individuals with both acute and chronic diseases and conditions, using preventative approaches through patient education. A doctor practicing allopathic medicine diagnoses the patient, supervises his/her care, prescribes medication and treatment methods, and works to improve healthcare. A degree in allopathic medicine usually consists of four years of study, with two of these years dedicated to science and the other two to clinical rotations. Once graduated, students enter residency programs lasting three to eight years depending on the specialty being pursued. For instance, training in family practice, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics usually lasts two to three years, while training in surgery may last five to eight years. Some medical schools offer joint degree programs which include an MD degree with a dual degree in PhD, MPH, JD, or MBA.
