Reviews Meditation Did NOT smell AT ALL like a previous bottle I bought Horribly sweet & artificial smelling Beautiful I bought this recently from a run out store in Sydney, Australia. I absolutely love the fragrance of this blend and why I searched online for the brand so I can buy more when I need to. In my web search I noticed this companies oils are highly regarded, so good to know, as you don't know what you are getting from an unfamiliar product. Great to see you price and ship to Australia. Absolute bliss I've tried a variety of other oil blends but Woolzies has it. It's all natural, no bad or weird odors and safe. I fell in love with the Meditation blends. Meditate reminds me of an Aveda blend. It's intoxicating and really has a pleasant aroma. I've hate obnoxious perfumes that are pungent, as they give me headaches but this blend is one to enjoy. Mild, floral, earthy and pleasant. Obviously high quality oils I discovered this scent when it was used in a mist diffuser in a house I toured with my realtor. The scent is so natural and earthy, and reminds me of something from my childhood. I took a pic of the bottle and ordered three for myself. They were a little pricy, but I think they're well worth it. I have terrible allergies, and the meditate blend smells clean and fresh without irritating my nose or eyes like a lot of other oils that claim to be natural. I also added a few drops to my homemade body butter, and the fragrance is light and clean without bothering my skin. It lasts for a few hours, but not all day. All in all, I'm quite pleased, and I plan on adding some Woolzies oils to my homemade soaps that I will be preparing for Christmas. "}
