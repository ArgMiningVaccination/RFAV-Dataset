The doctor must determine if the benefits of the medication outweigh not breast-feeding the child or exposing the infant to the effects of the medication. Drugs that previously may have been safe during pregnancy might be harmful when exposed through breast milk. Many considerations and factors are involved in determining what medications, if any, are safe to consume while breast-feeding. How Does Medication Enter Breast Milk? The entry of medication into human milk is a function of the mother's plasma level. Basically, as the drug interaction rises, so does the amount of the drug in the milk. Other variables include the drug's molecular size, solubility and half life. Medications can also enter breast milk by diffusion and secretion. Medication must move across the alveolar cells found in the mammary tissue to enter the milk. Also, more medications can enter the milk during the first week or two of milk production than when more mature milk is produced later.
