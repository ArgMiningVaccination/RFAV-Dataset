Women who deliver via cesareanhave 5- to 20-fold increased risk for postpartum infectioncompared with those delivered vaginally. 2Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of postcesareanfever and infections by over 50% in both nonelective andelective (scheduled) procedures. 2,3Given these clear benets, administration of prophylactic antibiotics be- came the standard of care in modern obstetric practice. Our case describes a patient who developed intraoperativeanaphylaxis to prophylactic antibiotics during cesareandelivery. Her postoperative course was intravascular coagulation(DIC), and reversible ischemic neurological decit. Re-view of the literature revealed few cases of anaphylaxisduring cesarean section. To our knowledge, this is the rst case of anaphylaxis during cesarean section followed by this set of complications. Herein, we will describe thecase and review relevant literature. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old woman (gravida 9, para 7) at 39 2/7weeks' gestation presented for scheduled repeat cesarean deliv- ery and bilateral tubal ligation. Her past medical history was signicant for prior allergic reaction to iodine andintravenous (IV) contrast media (anaphylaxis). Her an-tenatal care was signicant for iron-deciency anemia.On presentation, her vital signs were blood pressure (BP)133/83 mm Hg; heart rate (HR) 82/min; temperature36.6 8C, and respiratory rate 20/min. Physical examina- tion revealed mild pallor and term gestation. Laboratory evaluation showed hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, hematocrit 25.9%, and platelet count 232,000/mL. Given her mod-erate anemia, 2 U packed red blood cells were cross-matched prior to surgery. In the operating room, spinal anesthesia was administered without difculty, and cefazolin 1 g wasgiven intravenously after umbilical cord clamping. Fol-lowing administration of antibiotic, the patient's BP dropped to 90/50 mm Hg, but her HR remained stable at 70/min and O 2saturation at 100%. The initial impression was spinal hypotension, and IV fluids andvasopressors (ephedrine sulfate 40 mg intramuscularly,phenylephrine 1 mg, followed by 2 mg IV) were ad-ministered. Five minutes later, BP dropped further to55/25 mm Hg, but HR and O 2saturation remained stable at 75/min and 100%, respectively. The patient remained fully conscious and complained of generalized itching. Anaphylaxis was suspected, and an epinephrinedrip was initiated at 0.03 mg/kg/min and then titrated to effective dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min until BP was restored to120/70 mm Hg. Hydrocortisone 100 mg, diphenhydr- amine 50 mg, and famotidine 20 mg were also admin-istered intravenously. Surgery, including closure ofhysterotomy and bilateral tubal ligation, was completed, and hemostasis was secured. Generalized peau d'orange rash was noted upon closure if the skin. After surgery,the patient was taken to the postanesthetic care unit(PACU) for close observation. In the PACU, the patient was hemodynamically stable on continuous epinephrine 0.1 mg/kg/min infu- sion. However, after 150 minutes, her BP dropped againto 70/45 mm Hg, and HR increased to 140/min. No vaginal bleeding was noted, but her abdomen was notably distended. Bedside ultrasonography showed free intra-abdominal fluid. Laboratory evaluation revealed DIC;drop of 30.9 interna-tional normalized ratio of 3, and activated partial throm-boplastin time (aPTT) 57 seconds; low brinogen 62 mg/dL; and elevated brin degradation products to >20mg/ mL. Packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were transfused in addition to crystalloid and colloid fluids.Due the continued hemodynamic instability, the patientwas taken back to the operating room for an exploratorylaparotomy. Massive hemoperitoneum with /C244Lo f blood was noted. Hysterotomy was inspected. No activebleeders were evident, but generalized oozing was noted.Further exploration revealed intact liver, kidneys, bowel, and omentum. Both uterine arteries and infundibulopel- vic ligaments were ligated, and cryoprecipitate andthrombin were applied locally to control areas of oozing.After securing hemostasis, fascia was closed, subcutane-ous space was packed, and skin incision was left open fordelayed primary closure. The postoperative course after laparotomy was uneventful, and the patient was maintained on steroids, H1- and H2-blockers, and close observation. The clin- ical picture of DIC resolved within the rst 24 hours.She remained intubated in the surgical intensive careunit for a total of 48 hours before transfer to the generalfloor. On the fth postoperative day, the patient com-plained of blurry vision in her left eye as well as decreasedsensation and weakness of her right arm. Brain magneticresonance imaging with contrast revealed no abnormal- ities, and within 4 days, these neurological manifesta- tions completely resolved. Given the completelyreversible nature of these abnormalities and negativebrain imaging, the impression was reversible ischemicneurological decit. The patient continued to showsatisfactory improvement and was discharged home onthe tenth postoperative day in good condition. DISCUSSION Anaphylaxis, as recently dened by the National Insti-tute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy16 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY REPORTS/VOLUME 1, NUMBER 1 2011 and Anaphylaxis Network symposium, is ''a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may causedeath.'' 4The lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis from all triggers is estimated to be 0.05 to 2%. The most frequently identied triggers for anaphylaxis include foods (especially peanuts and tree nuts), drugs (anti-biotics, vaccines, medications, and anesthetics), insectvenoms, latex, and allergen are also a signicant number of which there is no cause identied (idio-pathic anaphylaxis). 5 Although anaphylaxis is a rare event during preg- nancy, it has the potential to lead to serious maternal and/ or fetal morbidity. In labor and delivery units, anaphylaxisis mainly caused by b-lactam antibiotics given for group B streptococcal prophylaxis. 6Mulla et al7studied the prevalence of anaphylaxis in obstetric patients using astatewide hospital discharge database of the state of Texasduring 2 years (2004 and 2005). Of 705,183 deliveries,they found 19 cases, with a prevalence of 2.7 cases per 100,000 deliveries. b-Lactam antibiotics (specically, a penicillin or a cephalosporin) were the anaphylactictrigger in 11 patients. Because antibiotics are frequentlyused in obstetrics patients, obstetricians are prone toencounter such anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, theyshould be familiar with criteria for diagnosis of anaphy-laxis and its management. These criteria (Table 1) wereproposed to facilitate the immediate recognition of ana- phylaxis and to standardize its diagnosis as well as providing a description for epidemiologic and researchpurposes. These criteria are likely to capture anaphylacticreactions in more than 95% of cases. Of note, the rstcriterion alone (that includes skin and/or mucous mem-brane involvement) captures 80% of cases, whereas /C2420% of cases lack such involvement. 4Sudden intrapartum cardi opulmonary distress is an acute emergency, and rapid assessment and inter-vention is crucial. In our case, the main differentialdiagnoses include anaphylaxis and amniotic fluid em- bolism. Because both cond itions present with very similar manifestations, in many cases it is difcult todifferentiate intrapartum anaphylaxis from amniotic fluid embolism. Data amniotic fluidembolus registry suggest th at amniotic fluid embolism is more similar to anaphylaxis than to an embolismper se, 8and the term anaphylactoid syndrome of preg- nancy has been suggested. The striking similarities between clinical and hemodynamic ndings in amniotic fluid embolism and anaphylaxis suggest a commonpathophysiological mechanis m for all these conditions. Moreover, similarities of both conditions include labo-ratory ndings. Serum tryptase level, usually used as amarker for anaphylaxis, was noted similarly elevated ina case of amniotic fluid embolism. 9The immediate differentiation of both conditions comes second after prompt management including hemodynamic support and aggressive resuscitation. In our case, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis was supported by the presence of cutaneous involvementwith generalized itching and urticarial rash and theabsence of hypoxemia. The potential trigger factors ofanaphylaxis include administration of antibiotics, anes-thetic agents, or contact with latex. However, there was a direct temporal relation of anaphylaxis upon the admin- istration of cefazolin antibiotic after delivering the infantand clamping the umbilical cord. This chronologicrelation makes latex allergy unlikely as anaphylaxis tolatex usually occurs at the beginning of surgery uponpatient's contact with latex products such as surgicalgloves. Table 1 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fullled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips, tongue, or uvula) and at least one of the following a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)b. Reduced BP end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips, tongue, uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, [collapse], syncope, incontinence)d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age-specic*) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BPb. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's baseline *Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg \u00fe[2/C23 age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

Although the relation between anaphylaxis andDIC has been described in animal trials, there is a scarcity of published cases in humans. Review of the literature revealed only two such cases. Inal et al 10 described a 16-year-old girl who underwent burn scardeformity reconstruction with insertion of latex tissueexpanders. This was followed by late-onset hypotension,thrombocytopenia, DIC, and pulmonary edema. Lom-bardini et al 11reported a 19-year-old woman who sustained anaphylactic shock due to a wasp sting. She subsequently had prolonged prothrombin time, pro- longed aPTT, and a low brinogen level, but a normalplatelet count. She had no bleeding, and these laboratoryabnormalities normalized in 24 hours. Choi et al 12used a mouse model to investigate the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as the potentiallink between anaphylaxis and DIC at the molecular level.Induction of active systemic anaphylaxis resulted in the development of DIC manifestations, which were pre- vented by pretreatment with platelet-activating factorantagonist (BN 50739). Moreover, the by a bolus injection of PAF. Thesendings strongly suggest that DIC can occur in anaphy-laxis, and PAF plays a pivotal role in the development ofDIC in anaphylaxis. As with the treatment of any critically ill patient, the treatment of anaphylaxis begins with a rapid assess- ment and maintenance of airway, breathing, and circu-lation. When a patient fullls any of the three criteria ofanaphylaxis as mentioned in Table 1, the patient shouldreceive epinephrine imme diately as the treatment of choice. Subsequent interventions are determined on thebasis of the clinical course and response to epinephrine.Aqueous epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg (maximum dose, 0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 5 to 15 minutes as necessary, is the recommended dosage for controllingsymptoms and maintaining blood pressure. The5-minute interval between in jections can be liberalized to permit more frequent injections if deemed necessary.Intravenous epinephrine is an option for patients with severe hypotension or cardiac arrest unresponsive tointramuscular doses of epin ephrine and fluid resuscita- tion. Although there is no pr ecisely established dosage or regimen for intravenous e pinephrine in anaphylaxis, 5- to 10- mg intravenous bolus (0.2 mg/kg) doses for h y p o t e n s i o na n d0 . 1t o0 . 5m gI Vi nt r e s e n c eo fcardiovascular collapse have been suggested. 4It is important to recognize the potential for lethal arrhyth-mias when administering intravenous epinephrine;therefore, continuous cardiac monitoring is recom- mended. Continuous low-dose epinephrine infusion might represent the safest and most effective form ofintravenous administration since the dose can be ti-trated to the desired effect. Low-dose intravenousepinephrine infusion has been successfully used in ana- phylaxis during labor and delivery without untoward fetaleffects. 7It is of paramount importance to note that intravenous injection of epinephrine should only be done using dilute 0.1 mg/mL (1:10,000) solution, whereas intramuscular injection is done using the ratherconcentrated 1 mg/mL (1:1000) solution. Mistakes inthis regard can have catastrophic consequences. 13 Patients who remain hypotensive despite epi- nephrine should have aggressive fluid resuscitation.Large volumes of crystalloid might be needed in therst 5 to 10 minutes; in severe reactions with hypo- tension, up to 35% of the blood volume might extrav- asate in the rst 10 minutes, and vasodilatation canc a u s ep o o l i n g ,w i t he v e nm o r er e d u c t i o ni nt h ee f f e c t i v eblood volume and, thus, distributive shock. Potentvasopressors, such as noradrenaline, vasopressin, ormetaraminol, might be required to overcome vasodila-tation if epinephrine and fluid resuscitation have failedto maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Antihistamines (H1- and H2-antagonists) are slower in onset of action than epinephrine, havelittle effect on blood pressure, and should be considereda second-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The effective-ness of corticosteroids has never beendetermined in placebo-controlled trials. However, theirusefulness in other allergic diseases has led to theirincorporation into anaphylaxis management. Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful in the acute management stage. It has been suggested thattheir use might prevent a protracted or biphasic reac-t i o n .I fg i v e n ,t h ed o s i n go fi n travenous corticosteroids should be equivalent to 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg per dose ofmethylprednisolone every 6 hours. 4 Reversible ischemic neurological decit has been dened as a sudden, focal neurological decit of a presumed vascular origin lasting 24 hours to 7 days. Recently, there has been a shift toward tissue diagnosisrather than time diagnosis with high-resolution com-puted tomography and diffusion-weighted magneticresonance imaging studies used to detect even very smallinfarctions. 14In our case, neurological decit is thought to have been secondary to the combination of hypoten-sion and DIC. These neurological decits completely resolved after resuscitation and expectant management. Because these ischemic changes can progress and becomeirreversible, obstetricians should be aware and promptlyidentify and treat such serious conditions. In summary, this case highlights the impor- tance of prompt recognition and management ofanaphylaxis by obstetricians. Aggressive treatment ofanaphylactic reactions can prevent other serious com- plications, including DIC and neurological vascular sequelae. Finally, a multidi sciplinary approach with appropriate consu ltation is important in the manage- ment of these cases.18 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY REPORTS/VOLUME 1, NUMBER 1 2011 REFERENCES 1.
