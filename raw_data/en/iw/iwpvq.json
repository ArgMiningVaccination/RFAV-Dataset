Generally speaking, meditation induces a sense of relaxation leading one to become receptive to enlightenment. Whereas prayer is the state of speaking to God or the Divine, either out loud or silently, meditation is the state of silently and calmly listening to hear insight, enlightenment and empowerment from our Divine creator. Meditation allows us to relax our minds, focus upon a particular point of reference and take a mini-vacation from the stresses of the day. Wikipedia's entry on [Meditation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) offers some good introductory information on the meditative practices of different religious and spiritual groups. For a good introduction to meditation, pick up a copy of [8 Minute Meditation](../books/8-minute-meditation-davich.php) by Victor Davich. Proper use of essential oils during meditation can enhance the experience by grounding you and promoting a sense of calm.
