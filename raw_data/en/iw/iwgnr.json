Introduction A. Overview The Missouri Department of Social Services (DSS) seeks Practice Site s comprised of licensed physicians (internal medicine, general medicine, pediatric, and family practice specialists) , collaborating with other licensed health care professionals including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, to serve as Health Homes for MO HealthNet participants . The Health Home is an alternative approach to the delivery of primary care services that promises better patient experience and b etter results than traditional care. The Health Home has many characteristics of the Patient -Centered Medical Home (PCMH) 1, but is customized to meet the specific needs of low -income patients with chronic medical conditions. The recognized primary care Practice Site s (\"Practices\") will work individually to continually evolve as a Health Home. Some of the recognized sites may also work with one another collectively to transform their Practices over at least a two -year period by participating in a learnin g collaborative2. DSS will require that all recognized Health Homes participate in Health Home transformation training . DSS will select some Practices to participat e in the learning collaborative . Those Practices that DSS does not select for learning collaborative participation and that are part of a multi -site practice organization will be required to participat e in practice organization -run training utilizing DSS-prescribed learning collaborative content which th e practice organization may choose to supplement . A Practice Site or Practice is defined as the single physical location at which a practice provides Health Home services . Organizations that wish to have mu ltiple Practice Sites recognized as Health Homes may submit one application , but with separate detailed responses for each Practice Site . DSS will consider e ach Practice Site individually. If a Practice includes both pediatric and adult specialties (i.e., family, internal, or general medicine), the P ractice will be required to operate the entire Practice as a Health Home and must submit one application that covers all primary care specialties at the Practice. Practices will also be required to obtain National Committee of Quality Assurance (NCQA) Pa tient Centered Medical Home recognition (see Section 2.E ). Practices will be paid for performing certain start -up activities, will be paid per -member - per-month (PMPM) payments for performing various Health Home activities, and may receive incentive paymen ts relating to performance, as more fully described in Section 3 . B. Health Home Qualifications In order to be recognized as a Health Home , primary care practice candidates must, at a minimum, as of the date of application submission : 1 For more information on the PCMH, see www.pcpcc.net/files/PCMH_Vision_to_Reality.pdf . 2 A learning collaborative is a p rocess pioneered by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement whereby clinical teams join clinical teams from other organizations to learn in order to generate performance improvement. Practice teams meet a few times face -to-face over the course of at leas t 12 months and learn from faculty and from one another. 3 have a substantial percentage (not less than twenty -five percent) of the patient panel enrolled in MO HealthNet or uninsured provide a Health Home that is capable of overall cost effectiveness; have strong, engaged leadership personally committed to and capable of leading t he practice through the transformation process and sustaining transformed practice processes as demonstrated by through the application process and agreement to participate in the learning collaborative, including in -person sessions and regularly scheduled telephone calls ; have patient panels assigned to each primary care clinician; actively utilize MO HealthNets comprehensive electronic health record for care coordination and prescription monitoring for MO HealthNet participants ; utilize an interoperable patient registry to input annual metabolic screening results, track and measure care of individuals, automate care reminders, and produce exception reports for care planning ; meet the minimum access requirements of third -next-available appo intment within 30 days and same -day urgent care, and have completed EMR implementation and been using the EMR as its primary medical record solution, to e -prescribe, and to generate, or support the generation of through a third party such as a data reposit ory, clinical quality measures relevant to improving chronic illness care and prevention for at least six months prior to the beginning of health home services . C. General Application Requirements Applicants must confirm that a substantial proportion of th eir popu lation served includes MO HealthNet -eligible and/or uninsured patients with chronic conditions . Applicants must comply with established timeframes . D. Application Timetable Unless otherwise specified, the time of day for the following events shall be between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Central Time (CT). DSS may adjust this schedule as it deems necessary. Notification of any adjustment to the Application Timetable shall be posted at http://dsspubt/mhd/cs/health -homes/ . 1. Application Issued June 13, 2011 2. Deadline for Written Inquiries July 8, 2011 3. Practices' Responses Due July 11, 2011 4. Anticipated Practice Notification Date September 30, 2011 4 E. Prospective Applicant Inquiries Prospective a pplicants may make written inquiries concerning this application until no later than July 8, 2011 at the address listed in Section 4. A, or by e -mail to Clinical.Services@dss.mo.gov . Inquiries received after the deadline may be disregarded. DSS will review inquiries received before the deadline and at its discretion prepare written responses to questions which it determines to be of general interest and that help to clarify the RF A (Request for Application ). Any written response will be posted at http://dsspubt/mhd/cs/health - homes/ . Only written responses will be binding on DSS. Section 2: Health Home Service Requirements Practices will work individually, and in some cases with one another collectively, to continually evolve as Health Homes by fulfilling the responsibilities delineated in Section 2. Failure to meet these responsibilities will be cause for suspension of Pra ctice Health Home payments and/or loss of Health Home provider status. This section describes substantially the activities Practices will be required to engage in and the responsibilities they will fulfill if recognized as a Health Home provider. Health Ho me status is also subject to change should the CMS or DSS determine that it is necessary to change the requirements of Health Homes or should CMS or DSS action cause for the elimination of the Health Home provider type. A. Health Home Tran sformation Training 1. Learning Collaborative DSS shall select and require some of Health Home -recognized Practices to participate in a Health Home learning collaborative in the following fashion. The Practice shall: designate three representatives of each Pract ices Core Practice Team to participate in a lea rning collaborative. Learning c ollaborative participation shall entail attendance at nine days of learning collaborative meetings, including seven days in the 12 months beginning with the first learning ses sion, and two days in the next twelve months . A senior clinician within the Practice, another clinician, and a non -clinician member (e.g., practice manager or practice administrator) of each Practices primary care Core Practice Team shall attend the learning collaborative meetings; participate w ith one or more members of each Core Practice Team in monthly one-hour learning collaborative conference calls or webinars; submit the data reports specified in Section 2. H, below; and participate in ad hoc, time -limited topical work groups (e.g., primary care and behavioral health integration) as requested by DSS. 5 2. Health Home Training DSS shall require a Practice organization that h as more than one of its Practice Sites recognized as Health Homes, but not all of its sites selected by DSS for learning collaborative participation , to designate a trainer to participate in a \"train -the-trainer program .\" The trainer shall attend the learning collaborative as a member of a Practices Core Practice Team and then train all the organizations other Health Home practices that DSS did not select for learning collaborative participation . DSS, or i ts designee, shall identify content that the Practice organization trainer will teach to the Health Home Practice Sites that do not participate in the learning collabora tive. B. Internal Practice Team Meetings Practices shall convene regular internal Practice Team meetings to plan and take steps to support continual Health Home evolution. C. Patient Registries Practices shall create and maintain patient registries, using electronic health record (EHR) software , a stand -alone registry or a third -party data repository and measures reporting system . A patient registry is a system for tracking information that DSS deems critical to the management of the health of a primary ca re practices patient population, including dates of delivered and needed services, laboratory values needed to track a chronic condition, and other measures of health status. The Practices registry shall be used for: patient tracking; patient risk stratification; analysis of patient population health status and individu al patient needs, and reporting, as specified in Section 2. H, below. 6 D. Mastery of the Required Health Home Core Competencies3 Practices shall transform how they operate in order to be come a Health Home. Transformation entails mastery of 13 Health Home core competencies, to be taught through the learning collaborative, and defined as follows: 1. Patient/family/peer/advocate/caregiver -centeredness4: This means that there is a whole patient orientation to care. Longitudinal care is delivered with transparency, individualization, recognition, respect, and an understanding of and respect for cultural and linguistic preferences .5 Such care also provides patients/families/caregivers with choic e in all matters and possesses an ongoing focus on consumer service, with bi -directional feedback. A practice demonstrates a defined structure at the practice level for gaining patient, family, or caretaker advisory input into overall patient satisfaction as well as feedback/suggestions/recommendations specific to operations of the health home. 2. Multi -disciplinary team -based approach to care : A collaborative multi -disciplinary care team in which team members practice to the full extent of their license, educ ation and training with bidirectional, effective team communication, collaboration and clear role definition. 3. Personal patient -primary care clinician relationships : Each patient has a primary care clinician relationship, even if cared for by a care team wi thin the Practice. 4. Planned visits and follow -up care : In contrast to episodic, reactive care, this manner of primary care delivery tracks patients on an ongoing basis so that the practice is informed and ready to address the patients needs holistically w henever the patient makes contact, and follows up with patients after encounters, as necessary. 5. Population -based tracking and analysis with patient -specific reminders : To support planned visits and follow -up care, a practice needs information tracking capa city in the form of a freestanding or EHR -based patient registry with reporting functionality to proactively identify patient and population gaps in care against evidence -based benchmarks . 6. Care coordination6 across settings, including referral and transition management : Practices assume responsibility for tracking and assisting patients as they move across care settings, and for coordinating services with other service providers including behavioral health, s ocial service, and long -term support providers. 3Some core competencies lend themselves to condition -specific changes (e.g., self -management support), while others require practice -wide change (e.g., patient -centeredness). For those core competen cies requiring condition -specific changes, DSS has adopted the idea that initial learning collaborative sessions would focus on a limited number of common conditions for the practices, with t he pediatric practices focus ing on different conditions than prim ary care practices treating an adult pop ulation. 4 \"Patient/family/caregiver\" recognizes that in pediatric care and in care for some adults, family members and caregivers play a primary role in identifying and communicating the health needs of a patient and in self - management activities. 5 Berwick DM. \"What Patient -centered Should Mean: Confessions of An Extremist\". Health Affairs 28, no. 4, w555 -565, published online May 19, 2009. 6 See Appendix A for definitions of \"care coordination\" and \"Clinical C are Management Services.\" 7 7. Integrated Clinical Care Management7 services focused on high -risk patients : For the most clinically at -risk patients in a practice, a care manager is either a) based in the practice or b) residing outside of the practice but otherwise tightly integrated with the Practice Team . 8. Patient and family education : The Practice Team educates patients and family members both on primary preventive care, and on self -management of chronic illness (i.e., secondary preventi ve care). 9. Self-management support by members of the Practice Team : Extending beyond education, self -management support assists the patient and/or family/ peer/advocate/ caregiver with the challenges of ongoing self -management, directly and/or through referra l. 10. Involvement of the patient in goal setting, action planning, problem solving and follow -up: Patient -centered primary care requires care planning and related activities focused on a patients specific circumstances, wishes and needs involving two -way communications and active patient involvement. 11. Evidence -based care delivery, including stepped care protocols : Care should be evidence -based wherever evidence exists, and follow stepped protocols for treatment of illness. 12. Integration of quality improvement strategies and techniques : Practices should utilize the improvement model emphasized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to measure performance, identify opportunities for improvement including those identified during and after the Health Home appl ication process, test interventions, and reassess performance. 13. Enhanced access : Another hallmark of patient -centered primary care is the availability of easy and flexible access to the Practice Team, including alternatives to face-to-face visits, such as e -mail and telephone8 and 24 hours per day/seven days per week practice coverage. E. National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Recognition By the eighteenth month following the receipt of the first Health Home payment, Practices shall submit to DSS evidence that the Practice has submitted an application to NCQA and obtained NCQA PCMH recognition at \"Level 1 Plus.\" Level 1 Plus recognition is defined for these purposes as meeting 2011 NCQA Level 1 standards, plus recognition for achieving the following 2011 NCQA PCMH standard at the specified level of performance: Standard 3C at 100% or 75% with an acceptable plan of correction . F. Clinical Care Management Services Practices shall provide Clinical Care Management Services, as further defined in Appendix A. Clinical Care Management entails the identification of highest -risk 7 See Appendix A for definitions of \"care coordination\" and \"Clinical Care Management Services.\" 8 Other use of technology, such as to improve medication compliance and provide remote behavior coaching, represents additional means for enhancing access. 8 patients, and intensive monitoring, follow -up, and clinical management of such patients. These activities generally include frequent patient contact, clinical assessment, medication re view and reconciliation, communication with treating clinicians, and medication adjustment by protocol. Practice shall employ or contract with licensed nurse(s) as the Practices Clinical Care Manager(s), responsible for providing Clinical Care Managemen t Services. The Clinical Care Manager shall function as a member of each Practice Team whenever patients of that Practice Team are receiving Clinical Care Management Services. Practices shall ensure and document that Clinical Care Management Services fund ing is used exclusively to provide Clinical Care Management Services . Recognized Health Home Practices may collaborate in provision of Clinical Care Management Services. G. Hospital Memorandum of Understanding By the third month , Practices shall develop a contract or memorandum of understanding (MOU ) with regional hospital(s) or system(s) to ensure a formalized structure for transitional care planning, to include communication of inpatient admissions of the Practices patients , as well as maintain a mutua l awareness and collaboration to identify individuals seeking emergency department services that might benefit from connection with the Practice , and in addition motivate hospital staff to notify the Pr actices designated staff of such opportunities . H. Data Reporting Practices shall submit to DSS or its designee the following reports, as further specified by DSS or it designee, within the time frames specified below: monthly narrative practice reports that describe the Practices efforts and progress to implement Health Home practices; monthly clinical quality indicator reports utilizing clinical data contained within the Practices patient registry or a third -party data repository; periodic submission of Health Home Implementation Quotient (MHIQ) surve y9 scores, as specified by DSS, and other reports, as specified by DSS. I. Demonstrated Evidence of Health Home Transformation Practices are required to demonstrate evidence of Health Home Transformation on an ongoing basis using measures and standards estab lished by DSS and communicated to the Practices. As of the publication date of this application, DSS defines evidence of Health Home transformation as follows: demonstrate d development of fundamental health home functionality at 6 months and 12 months based on an assessment pr ocess to be applied by DSS or its designee, and 9 The MHIQ 2.0 evaluation tool is accessible at: www.transformed.com/MHIQ/welcome.cfm . 9 demonstrate d significant improvement on clinical indicators specified by and reported to DSS or its designee. J. Notification of Primary Care Practice Changes Practices are required to no tify DSS within five working days of the following changes: the employment or contract of a Clinical Care Manager terminates subsequent to the initiation of Clinical Care Management payments; any substantive changes in Practice ownership or composition, i ncluding: o the Practice is acquired by another practice; o the Practice merges with another practice, and o the Practice acquires another practice. K. Participation in Evaluation Practices shall participate in an evaluation, to be performed by a DSS -designated evaluator . Participation may entail submission of monthly clinical indicator reports, submission of monthly narrative reports describing the Practice s transformation process, responding to surveys and requests for interviews of Practice staff and patient s. Practices shall provide all requested information to the evaluator in a timely fashion. Section 3. Payment Subject to all required federal approvals, DSS has developed the following payment structure for recognized Health Home Practices. All payments are contingent on the Practice meeting the requirements set forth in this application, as determined by DSS. Failure to meet such requirements is grounds for revocation of Health Home status and termination of payments specified within this ap plication. The anticipated payment methodology for Practices is in addition to existing fee -for-service payments and is described as follows: A. Quarterly start -up, training, and infrastructure cost reimbursement . Using a methodology developed by DSS, DSS wi ll reimburse Practice S ites for start -up costs and lost productivity due to collaboration demands on staff not covered by other streams of payment. B. Clinical Care Management per member per month (PMPM) payment . Using a methodology developed by DSS , DSS will make payment for reimbursement of the cost of staff primarily responsible for delivery of services not covered by other reimbursement (Primary Care Nurses, Behavioral H ealth Consultants ) whose duties are not reimbursable otherwise by MO HealthNet . C. Performance incentive payment . DSS will make payment to Practices for 50% of the value of the reduction in total health care PMPM cost, including payments A and B above, for the Practice Si tes attributed MO HealthNet fee-for-service patients, relative to prior year experience . Savings will be distributed on a sliding scale up to 50% of net 10 savings based on pe rformance relative to a set of Practice S ite-specific clinical preventive and chronic care measures generated and reported by the practice and subject to DSS audit . Payments described in Sections 3.B and 3.C will be based on DSS count of MO HealthNet participants assigned to or attributed to the Practice on a date certain each month. During Year 1, payments shall be made for only those participants over five years of age with two or more of the following characteristics: Serious Mental Health Conditions ; Substance Abuse Disorders ; Asthma ; Diabetes ; Cardiovascular Disease, including Hypertension ; Overweight (BMI> 25) ; Developmental Disabilities ; or, one of the previous chronic conditions and either tobacco use or diabetes as \"at risk of\" triggers . Participants not enrolled in a MO HealthNet Medicaid managed care plan will be attributed to the practice using a standard patient attribution algorithm adopted by DSS. Participants will, however, be granted the option to change their Health Home should they so desir e. Participants enrolled in a MO HealthNet Medicaid managed care plan will be attributed to the practice which the participant has selected or to wh ich the participant has been assigned by the plan. Should experience reveal to DSS that elements of the pay ment methodology will not function, or are not functioning, as DSS intended, DSS reserves the right to make changes to the payment methodology after consultation with recognized Health Homes and receipt of any and all required federal approvals. DSS is currently in the process of reviewing its propose d State Plan Amendment with CMS . CMS is generally supportive regarding the proposed rate st ructure and payment methodology . DSS understand s the challenge providers face in submitting applications not knowing the final, agreed upon payment rate and will share fin al details as soon as possible . Should a practice site find the final rate unac ceptable and determine that it no longer wish es to apply, it may withdraw its application with written notice to DSS witho ut penalty . 11 Section 4. Application Response Requirements A. General Submission Instructions Applications must be submitted by e-mail to Clinical.Services@dss.mo.gov by the date and time listed in the Procurement Timetable, Section 1. D.

For those responses that comply with the response submission instructions, including meeting the pre -qualification requirements defined in Section 1. B and the submission of a complete response to the application contained in Appendix B , an Evaluation Co mmittee designated by DSS will review the applications. 2. Applicant Interview At its discretion, DSS may elect to interview some or all applicants to assess their qualifications to serve as a Health Home. 3. Evaluation Criteria for Health Homes a. The following i dentifies the criteria by which DSS will evaluate written responses and interview findings, if any, from each applicant practice: the Practice demonstrates that it meets the practice pre -qualifications identified in Section 1. B; the quality of the response s to the questions in Appendix B in accordance with the following criteria: comprehensiveness, feasibility, appropriateness, 12 clarity, effectiveness, innovation, and responsiveness to the needs the core competency requirements of a Health Home, and the exte nt to which the practice demonstrates leadership commitment and basic capabilities that will allow it to effectively operate as a Health Home and continually evolve as such through practice transformation activity; Finally, DSS may consider any relevant in formation about the practice known to DSS. 4. Qualifying Applications DSS reserves the right to reject a practices application at any time during the evaluation proces s if the a pplicant: fails to demonstrate to DSS satisfaction that it meets all application requirements, or fails to submit all required information or otherwise satisfy all application requirements in Section 4 . DSS may determine non -compliance with an application requirement is insubstantial. 13 Appendix A General Functional Definitions of Care Coordination and Clinical Care Management Services (adapted from definitions developed by Ed Wagner, MD10) Care Coordination A core function of primary care and Health Homes is the delivery of a set of care coordination activities, assuring that patients receive timely, high quality and efficient health care and support services within and outside of the health home through the development and implementation of a care plan and development of patient self -management skills. Services may be identified either by the practice by referral or by the patient or other providers to maintain or improve the well being of the patient and includes clinical services , clinical and non-clinical support services available within the community , and fa cility -based services . To coordinate care effectively, this role involves activities to: identify available community resources ; assure that referrals made by the practice for external services result in timely appointments, timely two -way transmission of useful patient information, and address patient and practice concerns without duplication of services or provision of inappropriate services ; obtain reliable and timely information about external services not initiated by the practice such as emergency, patient -initiated, or other provider -initiated care, as well as case management in order to provide and receive patient information, and to assure safe and effective transitions ; interface with case management or disease management staff functioning on behalf of insurers, disease management companies, publicly funded programs, state agencies, including schools, etc. to assure that servi ces are consistent with the Health Home s care plan , and provide patient education and self -management support. Clinical Care Management The Clinical Care Manager has several unique functions, some of which can only be performed by a licensed n urse. The unique activities of the clinical care management role are the identification of high -risk patients, and their more intens ive monitoring, follow -up, and clinical management. These activities generally inclu de: frequent patient contact; clinical assessment; medication review and reconciliation ; communication with treating clinicians , and medication adjustment by protocol . 10 Judith Schaefer, MacColl Institute 14 Self-management support is also a critical element in this role. While Clinical C are Managers often take on some of the activities described in the care coordination role, especially related to transitions, their role is primarily clinica l rather than adm inistrative. The Clinical Care Manager can reside within the practice setting or be contracted through a community -based agency. In either situation, the Clinical Care Manager must be closely integrated within the practice primary care team. Note : The terms \"Case Management\" and \"Disease Management\" were consciously not used, because both terms are so closely linked to payer -based functions and as such differ from the practice -based functions described here. In addition, Case Management is a term that has specific meanings within several publicly funded health and human service programs. If successfully implemented and operated within the practice setting, Care Coordination and Care Management have the potential for eliminating the need for at least some public and private payer -based Case Management and Disease Management functions once practices are capable of assuming some or all of these responsibilities. Patients Who May Be in Need of Care Coordination and Clinical Care Management Patients Who May Be in Need of Care Coordination Patients Who May Be in Need of Clinical Care Management Description Patient or family with low to moderate level of self -actualization who has a current medical condition and/or risk factors needing services or is healthy, but in need of services to prevent diminution of health status. Patient with complex condition or multiple co -morbidities that places him or her at high risk for a future inpatient medical or behavioral health admission. Duration of Services Temporary, intermittent, or on -going, depending on nature of need On-going until sufficient reduction in risk Examples 8-year old recently diagnosed with autism who needs educational, social, behavioral health and family support Patient with uncontrolled diabetes Provider Type May be provided by trained layperson (parent, family advocate, community health worker), or a health care provider Must be provided by a licensed nurse Goal of Services Goal: to take action to assist the patient to remain as healthy as possible by accessing culturally appropriate and necessary care and community -based services and by using services appropriately. Goal: to take action to keep the person safely cared for wit hin the patient - centered health home or across a system of care within the community, preventing ER visits , hospitalization , reduce unnecessary facility admissions, and minimize nursing facility lengths of stay. 15 Patients Who May Be in Need of Care Coordination Patients Who May Be in Need of Clinical Care Management Focus of Services Broadly focusing on medical, psychosocial, educational needs and providing linkage to community services Primarily a medical focus Relationship to Health home Physically or virtually located within the practice.
