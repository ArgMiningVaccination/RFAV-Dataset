We'll help you heal what holds you back. We all carry an electromagnetic field of energy that surrounds our physical bodies. It's called the Human Energy Field \u2014 an important contributor to health and well-being. Over time, the Human Energy Field collects imprints from our memories and experiences, even the difficult ones. Especially the difficult ones. Sometimes those imprints prevent our energy from flowing freely. And while we can't name it, we can feel it. Energy Healing of Atlanta helps our clients identify and clear blocked energy, restore balance, and experience a happier and healthier existence. One that finally feels whole. Client Testimonials \"I came to work on some past trauma that we thankfully were able to figure out manifested itself as extremely severe menstrual pain and neck/shoulder pain. Suzanne was really patient with me and made sure that all my questions were answered. I went through three sessions with her and am considering going back at some point to do some additional work. Suzanne cleared out much of the negative energy that existed in my body, and we made some pretty great discoveries along the way. Very grateful for this experience, I highly recommend it to everyone!\" \u2014 Sahar K. \"It is difficult to explain the importance and impact Suzanne has made in my life and my spirit. Peeling back the layers of emotions and fatigue was so desperately needed, but I just couldn't get there on my own. Her compassionate, intuitive work has uplifted and unburdened me to the point that I now feel like I've begun again but with knowledge and faith that will sustain me in all my life challenges. I want every loved one in my life to have the same opportunity. If you're uncertain about this type of healing, I would encourage you to meet Suzanne and ask all your questions, then just do it. You won't regret it.\" \u2014 Katie G. \"How do you say Thank You to someone who has helped you heal and change your life in the most profound way? When I first met Suzanne, I could feel her warm and compassionate energy. She is as invested in your healing as you are. I didn't know much about energy work, and I could not have understood how important it is without this experience. Suzanne always knew what direction to go and what I needed. Each session was as amazing as the next. I was able to relax and be open because of her support. The detailed follow up notes from each session that she emails are invaluable. I will be forever grateful.\" \u2014 Kristie W. \"Life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you're not free.\" \u2014 Peter Crone Book A Consultation Consultations are free of charge.
