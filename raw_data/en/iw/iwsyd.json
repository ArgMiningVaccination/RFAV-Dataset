Our IRB-approved protocol involves the intravenous (IV) infusion of 300 million culturally expanded human umbilical cord tissue-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our Medical Director, Louis A. Cona, MD, is a pioneer in regenerative cell therapy, studying stem cells in the Cayman Islands for more than a decade. He continues to research alternative therapies for various medical conditions, and with IRB-approved clinical trials. Louis A. Cona, MD is certied by the World Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (WAAAM). He is an associate professor at St. Matthews School of Medicine, Deputy Chair of the Health Practice Commission Cayman Islands Government, past chairman of Medical & Dental Council of the Cayman Islands, Medical Director of the Strand Medical Centre, past president of Cayman Islands Medical & Dental Society. He is also a recognized member of the British Medical Association, the General Medical Council (UK), the Caribbean College of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Our IRB-approved protocol consists of a two-day period including the intravenous (IV) infusion of 300 million umbilical cord tissue-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). Our protocol is minimally invasive to the patient and has minimal downtime. There is typically a 1-2 hour rest and recuperation period immediately following the infusion. Our medical team administers the MSCs via intravenous injection. An IV line is inserted into the forearm and the cells are administered by hand into the line over the course of a few hours. Our manual administration protocol helps to reduce temporary side effects and promote higher cell viability numbers, leading to greater treatment efficacy. The procedure is non-invasive and there is no pain associated with the injection of cells. The patient is directly supervised by our medical team throughout the entire procedure to ensure safety and comfort. We are an outpatient facility, this means that patients will only be in the clinic for the duration of the treatments during the day. Patients are responsible for booking their own travel & accommodation - we require all patients to stay in Grand Cayman for a minimum of 5 days. Day 1: Arrival in Grand Cayman Day 2: Complimentary therapies (half day) Day 3: Mesenchymal stem cell infusion (full day) Day 4: Follow-up physical (1-2 hours) Day 5: Departure The procedure is minimally invasive (single IV transfusion) and has very little downtime. The therapeutic uses of stem cells as a potential for systemic inflammation has been immensely explored, the number of clinical trials conducted with Mesenchymal Stem Cells has increased exponentially over the past few years. The stated primary goal of our protocol is the marked reduction in the levels of systemic inflammation for an extended period of time. Stem cells have a unique, intrinsic property that attracts them to inflammation in the body. Studies have shown that stem cells can regenerate damaged or diseased tissues, reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system promoting better health and quality of life. Depending on the primary ailment or initial condition of the patient, the effects of stem cells may lead to a reduction in harmful symptoms, stabalization of condition and a significant quality of life improvement. vaccines Our protocol calls for the manual systemic (IV) administration of 300 million mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). monitor_heart To ensure the body is hydrated and fully prepared for treatment. emoji_food_beverage We will guide you through the pre-treatment detox regime in order to prepare your body for optimal stem cell activation. spa Complimentary therapies aimed at preparing the body for an influx of mesenchymal stem cells. no_food An anti-inflammatory diet can enhance cellular resistance to toxins and stress. support_agent We have a professional team dedicated to ensuring the onboarding process is as smooth as possible. accessibility_new There is no extraction process involved & the cells are infused via a single IV line. Recovery time is roughly 1-2 hours. accessible_forward Our facility, airport and partner resorts are fully handicap accessible. Additionally, our team can assist when needed if the patient is non-ambulatory. eco MSCs have potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties without the negative side effects of traditional medications. Adherence to the cGMP regulations assures the identity, strength, quality, and purity of our mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) product by requiring that our partner lab adequately controls manufacturing operations. Our protocol involves the systemic administration of 300 million culturally expanded Mesenchymal Stem Cells derived from American Association of Tissue Bank (AATB) certified suppliers of full term (>36 weeks), ethically donated human umbilical cords in the United States. Umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) have the ability to become different cell types and have the greatest proliferation rate of other types of stem cells (adipose, bone marrow, etc). UC-MSCs are known to secrete growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, improving different cell repair mechanisms. These functions all assist the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Non-invasive cell product The harvesting procedure of UC-MSCs is non-invasive as it does not require extraction from the patient. The MSCs are taken directly from the Wharton's Jelly an area of an ethically donated human umbilical cord. UC-MSCs also have a high proliferative potential than other sources of stem cells meaning they expand in vitro more effectively allowing for greater efficiency when obtaining higher cell numbers. DVC Stem (Da Vinci Wellness Centre) is partnered with an award-winning medical laboratory located in the United States, which is fully FDA registered, cGMP compliant, ISO 9001, and ISO 13485 certified. All of our cells are expanded using safe and standard protocols and are then flown overnight in sub-zero (-190\u00b0 celsius) dewar containers directly to our clinic for treatment. To ensure maximum treatment effectiveness, all of our cells are tested for viability (% of live cells) prior to use. Our partner lab in the United States only uses American Association of Tissue Bank (AATB) certified suppliers of full-term (>36 weeks), donated human umbilical cords. The selection of these donated tissues is extremely regulated and strict. The cords are tested for STDs, Hep A/B/C/D, TB, Zika virus, no history of cancer or chronic illness, no history of autoimmune diseases, no tattoos or piercings, no travel abroad with one year, no history of CJD, negative for HIV, negative for HTLV 1 AND 2, negative for SARS-COV2 and no history of drug or alcohol abuse. After the tissue is vigorously screened and accepted, our lab uses a clinical-grade and award-winning proprietary culture medium to expand the stem cells out to roughly 300 million cells per treatment. Full international and domestic compliance & regulations are followed. We use a COVID-19 free MSC product. We only use umbilical cord tissue sourced from unvaccinated donors. vaccines Adherence to the cGMP regulations assures the identity, strength, quality, and purity of our mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) product by requiring that our partner lab adequately controls manufacturing operations. science DVC Stem is partnered with an award-winning medical laboratory located in the United States, which is fully FDA registered, cGMP compliant, ISO 9001, and ISO 13485 certified. biotech Cell viability assays are used to measure the physical and physiological health of cells in response to extracellular stimuli and ensure every patient receives the same dosage (300m MSCs). approval A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a document that communicates the results of scientific tests done on the cells prior to infusion.

Patient response is dependent on a large variety of biological factors, however is also subject to the behavior and lifestyle of the patient. Patients who adhere to an active lifestyle, anti-inflammatory diet, and restrict the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine can seen sustained results for 2+ years, depending on condition. On average, patients have reported little signs of regression up to 24 months following the infusion and patients rarely return to their pre-infusion state. As required by our IRB, our patient management team will follow-up with patients every 3 months for 12 months post-treatment in order to collect post-treatment efficacy data. We are currently still collecting long-term data and do not have any published results to share specifically related to our IRB-approved clinical trials. (Trial HPC/CTR/003). However, preliminary data that has been collected over the past 4 years has been exciting. Patient reported results have since shown that ~87.5% of our total patient population have noted a sustained improvement in their condition within 3 months of treatment. More specifically, the current average improvements for our patients 3 months after treatment are as follows: 75% increase in Stamina 53.75% increase in Libido 51.40% increase in Energy Levels 43.97% increase in Balance 28% increase in Coordination 23.19% increase in Strength 21% increase in Vision Average improvements concerning cognitive function 12 months after treatment are as follows: 19.84% improvement in Memory 44% improvement in Ability to Concentrate 31.94% improvement in Decision Making 12.5% increase in Quality of Sleep Study participants may produce measurable results within 3-6 months following their infusion. This is indicated by a marked reduction in levels of systemic inflammation and changes in general vitality as measure by our follow-up questionnaire. However, it is common for patients to report improvements in their quality of life and a lessening of their symptoms within the first few weeks following their infusion. However, every patient is unique and may respond to treatment differently. Hundreds of studies have shown the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for various degenerative diseases.
