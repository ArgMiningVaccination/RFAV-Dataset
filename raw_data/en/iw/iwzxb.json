Get vaccinated Getting vaccinated protects you against COVID -19, helps reduce the risk of severe illness and the spread of COVID -19 to others. A fourth COVID -19 dose is recommended 3 months after your third dose for: adults aged over 50 years people aged over 12 years who are severely immunocompromised, have a disability with complex health needs or have severe or multiple health conditions that increase the risk of COVID -19. Those aged between 30 and 49 years have the option to receive a fourth COVID -19 vaccine dose. Children aged between 6 months and under 5 years who are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID -19 are recommended a paediatric formulation of the Modernavaccine . Booking s can be made via the vaccine clinicfinder for participating GPs state -wide or via the Coronavirus Hotline 1800 675 398 for specialist vaccination clinics in metropolitan Melbourne . If you have had a confirmed COVID -19 infection, it is recommended that you wait 3 months to get a COVID -19 vaccination, but your individual circumstances should be discussed with your GP. Get tested Everyone's first option should be a rapid antigen test. Free rapid antigen test kits are available from your local ACCHO and COVID -19 testing centres for you and ea ch family member listed on your Medicare card if you have symptoms or are a household contact. Remaining up to date with your vaccination prevents waning immunity (loss of protection) and provides an extra layer of protection against new variants. Current vaccination eligibility There are recent updates to vaccination advice that you or your family members may be eligible for based on your age and health needs. OFFICIAL PCR tests are available only in limited circumstances and are based on your clini cal need. Priority will be given to people who are at higher risk of severe illness: Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander 65 years or older children under 2 (even without symptoms) diagnosed with other health conditions have moderate to severe COVID -19 symptoms pregnant or gave birth up to two weeks ago not vaccinated or not up to date with their vaccination. Stay home if unwell Report your positive result If you have any COVID -19 symptoms, it is important you stay home and take a rapid antigen test. If you tested positive for COVID -19, it is important to report your positive rapid antigen test result to get access to treatment, including COVID -19 medicines in the first 5 days of COVID -19 symptoms. You can report your positive result online , or by calling the Aboriginal COVID -19 Infoline (1800 312 911) or the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 as soon as possible. There is no need to report a positive PCR test result. Be COVIDSafe Isolate (in a separate area of your home to others that are not positive) at home for at least 5 days or up to 7 days, depending upon your symptoms. It is essential that you tel l your household and social contacts, including education or workplace. If you have symptoms or are unwell, please contact your GP or ACCHO and ask for a telehealth appointment. If you need emergency relief while self -isolating, please call the Aboriginal COVID -19 Infoline on 1800 312 911 , or the Coronavirus (COVID -19) hotline on 1800 675 398 to request an emergency relief package. If you are not isolating and require emergency relief, you can contact your local Aboriginal Community Controlled Organi sation for support. COVID Positive pathways COVID Positive Pathways provides care and support at home for Victorians with COVID -19 and is delivered by Victorian hospitals, community health services (including collaboration with Aboriginal health services ), GPs and other providers, and coordinated by the Victorian Department of Health. In order to access the care you need, you must: complete a short survey when you report your positive rapid antigen test result, or respond to an SMS with a link to a short survey if you took a PCR test. Based on your survey responses, you will receive a text message from the Department of Health. This message OFFICIAL will let you know whether you have been allocated to the COVID Positive Pathway program or if you can safely manage your COVID symptoms at home without extra support COVID -19 medicines/antivirals Early treatment medicines are available for eligible people with COVID -19 to prevent severe illness and needing hospital care. For COVID -19 medicines to work at their best, most must be started early - within the first 5 days of COVID -19 symptoms. This is why it is important to get tested for COVID -19 as soon as you notice any symptoms, particularly if you are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are eligible to receive COVID -19 medicines if they: have multiple complex health conditions, and are aged 30 and above. To view the eligibility criteria, visit Antivirals and other medicines . Speak to a GP or your local Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisation for more information, including having an eligibility discussion and to have a plan in place if you are at risk of severe symptoms. Wear a face mask Wearing a well-fitted mask , especially high -quality masks like N95 and P2, can help protect you and those around you who may be at greater risk of severe illness from COVID -19 or flu. The more people who wear masks, the less virus transmission happens, and the fewer people will get s ick with COVID -19. Masks are still required to be worn in some settings. We recommend you wear a mask if you are in an indoor public place, can't physically distance in a crowded outdoor space, or are close to a person at higher risk of severe COVID -19. If you wear a N95/KN95 mask you reduce your risk of infection by over 83% and a surgical mask by two -thirds (66%). Wearing a cloth mask more than halves your risk of COVID infection. Let fresh air in COVID -19 is airborne and spreads when a person breathes out tiny droplets or aerosols that contain the virus. These aerosols can float in the air for a long time, and others can breathe them in. Ventilation adds fresh air and lowers the number of aerosols in a room, reducing the risk of transmission from one person to another. OFFICIAL You can use these 5 steps to improve ventilation at home: 1. Natural ventilation : Natural ventilation uses natural airflow to bring fresh air into a space. Where possible, open doors, windows, and vents to let fresh air into rooms and corridors. 2. Heating and cooling systems : Use existing heating or cooling systems to let outdoor air in. If you have a split system, keep it on, but you should also use natural ventilation or portable air filters to dilute or remove aerosols. 3. Filter air with portable air cleaners : Portable air cleaners (filtration units, scrubbers or purifiers) use filters to remove aerosol particles and other contaminants and release clean air. Put air cleaners in places with the least ventilation - away from windows, vents, fans, and grilles. 4. Use ceiling and pedestal fans : Fans circulate air in a room but do not provide fresh air. Use them in addition to other methods and open w indows and doors to dilute or remove aerosols. Place pedestal fans near a n open window if possible and point them away from people, so they do not blow air onto someone. 5. Limit the number of people in a space : Consider reducing the number of people in the room. If you have visitors to your home or workplace, provide good ventila tion.
