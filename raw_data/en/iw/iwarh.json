Loved ones have expressed concern, and you feel bad about the pain you're causing. You feel like you're caught in a trap. Recovery isn't easy, but you can do it. Start with admitting that you need help. If you're not sure what the detox meaning is and how you'll go about recovery, the right information can put your mind at ease. What Is Detox? Detox, or detoxification, is simply the process where addictive toxins leave your body. It doesn't happen overnight. The entire process can take up to one or two weeks. You might feel effects for many weeks afterward. It's not a pleasant process because you'll have withdrawal symptoms that range from mildly uncomfortable to very painful. However, the worst symptoms will occur the first one to three days. After that, they'll gradually diminish. Once your body is clear of all drugs and alcohol, then you begin the next phase of rehab and recovery. Detox Meaning: More Than One Type The detox meaning, while simple, doesn't include various detox methods. The end result is the same, but you may get there in different ways. - Medical detox: A [medical detox](/programs/primary/medical-detox/)may or may not involve medication. Some facilities just use the term \"medical\" to refer to your stay in a clinical setting. For centers that do administer medication, this is usually done to ease withdrawal symptoms. - Inpatient detox: You'll stay in a facility, where you'll have constant supervision. This is the safest way to go through detox. You may or may not have medical options. Your facility will choose the best course of treatment, depending on the severity of your addiction. - Outpatient detox: While some facilities do offer outpatient detox as an option, the risk of relapse is higher since clients don't live in the facility. Therefore, it's wise to avoid rehab centers that offer this as a primary option. What about the at-home detox meaning? This is usually not recommended. Individuals could have severe withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or hallucinations. They may harm themselves or others as a result. Plus, the risk of relapse is higher. People often turn back to using because withdrawal is so uncomfortable. Checking into a detox facility is the best, safest way to go through the process.
