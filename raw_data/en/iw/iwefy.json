Use fingers or tweezers to remove, rub crystals in palms, soy wax is also an all natural moisturizer. Or wash with soap and water to remove any excess wax. 2. Burn times vary with each candle depending on the container and size. For small and medium sizes allow them to burn for a minimum of 2 hours and maximum of 4 hours. For larger sizes they can burn from 3-6 hours. Pottery pieces hold better heat then tea cups. When burning a candle allow the wax to liquify on all edges of the container before extinguishing. 3. Light the wood wicks as close to the base as possible, tilt candle on its side to light if necessary and tilt back and forth to fully allow wood wick to light. Relight if needed, think of it as a very small fire sometimes they need a little patience. 4. Keep candles away from any flammable materials when lit. Do not leave under an air vent or near any breeze. Please watch small children and keep away from pets. Some oils can be harmful to animals, cats can be very sensitive compared to dogs. Always do your own research. 5. Soy Candles can be put in the fridge in between burns when fully extinguished to allow soy wax to harden faster and cool container down to make them last longer. Excess wax can be used as an all natural moisturizer. 6. Once candle is completely burned down to the bottom there are many different possibilities to re-use the container.
