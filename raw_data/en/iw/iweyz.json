Objective. To investigate the effects of Jianpi Bushen (JPBS), a traditional Chinese medicine that is used to invigorate the spleen and tonify the kidney, combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer. Methods. Literature retrieval was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CNKI, Wanfang Data Information Site, and VIP from inception to October 2017 . Randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of JPBS combined with chemotherapy were identified. The primary reported outcomes were KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status), clinical curative efficiency, immune function, blood system, andnonhematologic system. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) was used for data analysis, and the quality of the studies was alsoappraised. Results. A total of 26 studies were included with 3098 individuals. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that treatment of gastric cancer with the combination of JPBS and chemotherapy resulted in better outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone.Conclusion. Evidence from the meta-analysis suggested that JPBS comb ined with chemotherapy has a positive effect on gastric cancer treatment. However, additional rigorously designed and l arge sample randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment. 1. Introduction Gastric cancer is a significant contributor to the worldwide incidence of cancer and cancer-related deaths. The highincidence and mortality of gastric cancer make it one of themost deadly of cancers. The primary clinical treatment issurgery, which increases the survival rate of patients withinfive years after treatment [1]. S o m er e p o r t sh a v es h o w nt h a tg a s t r i cc a n c e rp a t i e n t s that underwent resection or radical surgery subsequentlysuffered from residual tumor metastasis, malnutrition, andother complications, due to the effects of surgical trauma onthe immune function, making surgery a less preferred optionfor patients with compromised immunity [1]. Another studyreported that disease progression of tumor cells can be sloweddown by the release of an immunosuppressive agent inducedby postoperative tissue damage. Infection may interferewith the immune suppression function, not only affectingthe patient's recovery, but also allowing residual cancercells to proliferate, increasing the postoperative recurrencerate [2]. One study suggested that gastric cancer patientsshould be given early postoperative gastrointestinal nutritionintervention to improve gastrointestinal metabolism andautoimmune function, but further studies are required [3]. In China, the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is about 60% [4]. Patients with early diagnosiswho have undergone surgical treatment, preoperative orpostoperative chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy canobtain good therapeutic effect. However, about 60% ofpatients are diagnosed with gastric cancer after the age of Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2018, Article ID 4924279, 14 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/49242792 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 65, and there is a significant risk of performing a surgery on these patients. Therefore, chemotherapy is widely usedas a part of treatment of almost all patients with gastriccancer [5]. However, chemotherapy often causes adversereactions in patients, including fatigue, anemia, vomiting,decreased neutrophils, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and nausea. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reported that these chemotherapy regimens may produce severe to life-threatening effects (grade 3-4 adverse reactions according tothe NCI's Common Toxicity Criteria) [5]. Additionally, drugresistance seriously limits the curative effect of chemotherapy. In China, many clinical randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that Chinese herbal compounds canb eb e n e fi c i a la sap a r to fa d j u v a n tc h e m o t h e r a p ya n dc a nimprove immunity, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce thepossibility of cancer recurrence and metastasis [6, 7]. Chinesemedicine (TCM) has now expanded outside of China ande v e nA s i ai nt h ep a s t1 5y e a r sa n di sn o ww e l lr e c e i v e di nAustralia, Europe, and the United States. In the UK, about2,000 shops and clinics provide Chinese medicine, includ-ing Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture treatment. However, Chinese medicine treatment still lacks effective international evaluation [8]. Jianpi Bushen (JPBS) is a Chinese medicine mixture of several compounds designed to invigorate the spleen and kid-ney (this is the meaning of Jianpi Bushen). JPBS is widely usedin combination with chemotherapy in China for the clinicaltreatment of gastric cancer. In this study, a meta-analysis isperformed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of JPBSused together with chemotherapy for gastric cancer treatmentto determine whether it can improve the clinical efficacyof treatment of gastric cancer, enhance immune function,r e v e r s ed r u gr e s i s t a n c e ,a n dr e d u c ea d v e r s er e a c t i o n s . 2. Methods 2.1. Eligibility Criteria Types of Studies. Our study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the efficacy of JPBS combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer and other indicators, regardless of the length of treatment. T y p e so fP a r t i c i p a n t s . Participants of any age and gender with a diagnosis of gastric cancer based on the \"Guidelines for Standardized Diagnosis and Treatment of Gastric Cancer\"(2013 edition) [34] were included. No subjects with signifi-cantly damaged liver and kidney function were included inthe study. Types of Interventions. Interventions were JPBS combined with chemotherapy for treatment of gastric cancer. Treat- ments that included other anticancer herbs were notincluded. T y p e so fO u t c o m eM e a s u r e s . The main outcome measures were Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), clinical effi- cacy, blood system measurements (white cells, platelets,and and immune parameters (CD3 +,C D 4+,CD8+, CD4/CD8+,N K+,E - r o s e t t e ,a n dm a c r o p h a g e s ) .Th e secondary indicators were other adverse reactions includinggastrointestinal reactions, neurotoxicity adverse reactions,hand-foot syndrome, and bone marrow suppression. Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the WHO eval- uation criteria for the recent treatment of solid tumors [35]. Outcomes were complete remission (CR): all lesions disappeared and were maintained for four weeks; partialresponse (PR): the lesions were reduced by at least 30% andwere maintained for 4 weeks; stable disease (SD): non-PR;and disease progression (PD): a 20% increase in the lesionor an increase of 5 mm in absolute value. CR and PR wereconsidered effective treatments. 2.2. Literature Search. We performed literature retrieval elec- tronically in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Chinese National KnowledgeInfrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Information Site, andChinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP).All of the searches were conducted in October 2017 andincluded all articles in those databases prior to that time.The search terms used are c a n c e ro ft h es t o m a c h \"O R\" g a s t r i cc a r c i n o m a \" ) .Th e s eterms were translated into Chinese when searching the Chi-nese databases. In the process of screening the literature, we identified two articles describing studies with compound E Jiao Jiang (compound donkey-hide gelatin slurry, abbreviatedas FEJ) combined with chemotherapy for gastric cancer.Because FEJ contains JPBS, these studies were also includedin the meta-analysis. 2.3. Study Selection and Data Extraction. Two researchers (Xiaoqian Hao and Naijun Yuan) independently identified the relevant studies by reading the titles and abstracts andexcluded documents that did not meet the inclusion criteria.The full text of the remaining studies was then read, and stud-ies were assessed for inclusion in the meta-analysis based onthe inclusion and exclusion criteria. To ensure accuracy andreliability, all the data and other clinical findings about thepatients' characteristics, treatment details, and other clinicaloutcomes were extracted independently using standardizeddata collection tables from two investigators (Fengjie Bie andYurong Wang). To avoid subjective bias, the author's name,t h ey e a ra n dc o u n t r yo ft h ep a p e rp u b l i s h e di nt h ej o u r n a l ,and the titles were omitted in the data extraction. Twocollaborators (Guijuan Zhang and Min Ma) jointly resolveddisagreements about research content or data extraction. The other researchers (Xuefeng Jiang and Xiaoping Chen) independently extracted the data as follows: (1) the studydesign summary, including demographic characteristics, ran-domized methods, and implementation of blind methods,and (2) the sample size, short-term clinical effects, KPSscores, adverse reactions, and immunological expression inthe treatment group and control group. 2.4. Risk of Bias in Individual Studies. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies according to the CochraneEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Records identied through database searchingCNKI (n = 42)VIP (n = 34)Wanfang Database (n = 27)Additional records identied through other sourcesPubMed (n = 1)EMBASE ( n = 1) Cochrane Library ( n = 4) MEDLINE (n = 1) Records a/f_ter duplicates were removed (n = 98) Records screened (n = 98)Records excludedReview article ( n = 4) Animal experiment (n = 4)/T_heory research (n = 3)Nongastric cancer or Jianpi Bushen (n = 23) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 64) Full-text articles excluded ( n = 38) Not RCTs (n = 11) Unreasonable drugs ( n = 19) Complete data were not available or converted (n = 8) Studies included in quantitative synthesis(meta-analysis) (n = 26) Figure 1: Study selection flow diagram. Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 8.5; Higgins, 2011). This assessment included seven aspects:random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blind-ing of participants and investigators, blindness of outcomeassessments, incomplete outcome data, selective outcomereporting, and other biases. We judged each aspect as havinglow, unclear, or high bias based on the Cochrane criteria. 2.5. Data Synthesis and Analysis. We used Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) for data analysis. We analyzed the statistics by means of the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidenceinterval (CI). The heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed byand 2test statistics. For statistics, a value of < 0.05 was considered to have significant difference. We tested random effects models for meta-analysis when significant heterogeneity existed ( < 0.05 and2>5 0 %) among the included studies. Otherwise, fixed-effects models were applied. Funnel plots were used to evaluate publicationbias when more than ten studies were identified. 3. Result 3.1. Description of Studies. We identified 178 potentially rele- vant articles. After screening titles and abstracts, 80 articleswere excluded as nonclinical studies, expert experience,or case reports. We reviewed the remaining 64 studies indepth, and 38 studies were excluded because they did notmeet our inclusion criteria, 11 of which were not RCTs,19 articles reported treatment performed in combinationwith other traditional Chinese medicine therapies, and 4were excluded because the outcome index did not meetthe demand. Therefore, a total of 26 articles [9-33, 36]involving 3098 participants met our inclusion criteria. Thescreening process is summarized in a PRISMA flow diagram and presented in Figure 1. The 26 studies included 3098 participants: 1726 in the experimental group and 1372 int h ec o n t r o lg r o u p .A l ls t u d i e sw e r ec o n d u c t e di nC h i n a .A l lstudies included were two-group parallel designed studies.The detailed characteristics of the included studies are listedin Table 1. 3.2.

Immune Function (Figure 4). The expression level of CD3 +, a marker of immune function, was measured and reported in 6 of the 26 included trials [10, 12, 15, 21, 23, 24], containing 435 patients. The result of the heterogeneity test (Chi2=6 7 . 0 2 , < 0.00001, 2=9 3 %) indicated statistically significant heterogeneity between studies. Results show mean difference (MD) = 8.13, 95% CI: 4.57 to 11.69, < 0.00001, indicating a statistically significant differencebetween JPBS combined with chemotherapy group andchemotherapy group. These results show that JPBS combinedwith chemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer canincrease CD3 +expression.

This result shows that JPBS combined withchemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer can signifi-cantly improve the CD4 +expression level. Six trials [10, 12, 15, 21, 23, 24] with 435 cases reported CD8+expression level.

The MD and 95% CI were 0.33 (0.23, 0.43), < 0.00001, indicating a statistically significant differencebetween the two groups. This shows that JPBS combined withchemotherapy can significantly improve the expression levelof CD4 +/CD8+for the treatment of gastric cancer. NK+levels were reported in six trials [10, 12, 21, 23, 27, 36] with 356 patients. The MD and 95% CI were 2.41 (1.43, 3.39),<0.00001, indicating that JPBS combined with chemother-apy for treatment of gastric cancer can significantly improvethe NK +expression level. Three studies [27, 29, 36] with 442 patients applied E- rosette as an outcome measure. The heterogeneity test showed Chi2=257 .77, < 0.00001,a n d 2=9 9 %, indicating large statistical heterogeneity between studies. The MD and 95% CI were 2.10 ( 1.85, 6.04), = 0.30, indicating that JPBS combined with chemotherapy did not affect E-rosetteexpression. Finally, data were extracted from two studies [29, 36] including 326 patients to assess macrophage expression levels. The heterogeneity test showed Chi 2=20.25,<0.00001,a n d 2=9 5 %, indicating large statistical heterogeneity between studies. The MD and 95% CI were 2.53 (0.02,5.08), = 0.05. This indicates that JPBS combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer significantly increased themacrophage expression level. 3.3. Safety Evaluation 3.3.1.

The change of gastrointestinal reaction was reported by twelve t r i a l s[ 1 2 ,1 5 ,1 7 ,1 9 ,2 0 ,2 2 ,2 4 ,2 5 ,2 7 - 2 9 ,3 6 ]w i t h1 9 1 9p a t i e n t s .Th eO Ra n d9 5 %C Iw e r e0 . 3 1(0.24,0.40) ,<0.00001, indicating a statistical difference between the twotreatment groups and suggesting that JPBS combined withchemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer can reducethe incidence of gastrointestinal reaction when comparedwith chemotherapy alone. Five trials [12, 15, 21, 22, 26] that included 356 cases reported the incidence of neurotoxicity adverse reaction. TheOR and 95% CI were 0.33 (0.20,0.55),<0.0001, indicating a statistical difference between the two treatment groups andsuggesting that JPBS combined with chemotherapy for thetreatment of gastric cancer can greatly reduce neurotoxicityadverse reactions when compared with chemotherapy alone. Five trials [15, 17, 21, 22, 24] including 495 cases reported changes in hand-foot syndrome. The OR and 95% CI were0.31(0.21,0.45), < 0.00001, indicating a statistical dif- ference between the two treatment groups and suggestingthat JPBS combined with chemotherapy for the treatmentof gastric cancer can greatly reduce the damaging incidenceof hand-foot syndrome when compared with chemotherapyalone. The incidence of myelosuppression was reported by three s t u d i e s[ 1 4 ,2 1 ,2 2 ]i n c l u d i n g1 9 6c a s e s .I nt h em e t a - a n a l y s i s ,t h eO Ra n d9 5 %C Iw e r e0 3 1( , 0 . 5 6 ) , =0.0001,i n d i c a t - ing a statistical difference between the two treatment groups.This result indicates that JPBS combined with chemotherapycan greatly reduce the incidence of myelosuppression, com-pared with chemotherapy alone, when used in the treatmentof gastric cancer. 3.4. Risk of Bias. We utilized the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 8.5; Higgins, 2011) to evaluate the risk of bias for each includedarticle. The included studies all claimed randomization, butthe methods used for random sequence generation werereported by only 13 of the 26 trials [9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23-25, 28, 30, 32]. None of the studies mentioned allocationconcealment or described the process of blinding of partic-ipants and personnel and blinded outcome assessment, 26of which were reported to have unclear risk of bias. Sevenstudies [9, 17, 19, 23, 28, 29, 32] did not provide all requiredi n f o r m a t i o na n dt h ed e t a i l so ft h ed a t a .S i n c es t u d yp r o t o c o l swere not available, selective reporting was identified as anunclear risk in all included studies (see Figures 7 and 8). 3.5. Publication Bias Analysis. Figures 9-12 present the fun- nel plots generated for studies with data on KPS score, immune function, safety evaluation of the blood system, andnonhematologic safety evaluation. The results showed that all points in the funnel plots were asymmetrical, indicating that there may have been publication bias in our study that mightinfluence the results of our analysis. 3.6.

Thus, the main principle of the Chinesemedicine treatment for gastric cancer is to invigorate thespleen and kidney (this is the meaning of Jianpi Bushen)[33]. We performed a meta-analysis of data that support theefficacy of this treatment strategy. As an auxiliary therapy forgastric cancer, JPBS combined with chemotherapy improvedt h ee ffi c i e n c yo fc l i n i c a lc u r a t i v ee ff e c t ,i n c r e a s e dK P Ss c o r e ,increased the levels of CD3 +,C D 4+,C D 4+/CD8+,N K+,a n d macrophages, and reduced the level of CD8+and the rates of decline of WBC, PLT, and Hb. Additionally, patients whoreceived JPBS combined with chemotherapy showed reducedincidence of gastrointestinal reaction, reduced neurotoxicityadverse reaction, reduced hand-foot syndrome, and reducedincidence of myelosuppression.4 . 2 .A n a l y s i so fJ P B SF o r m u l a t i o n . Many studies have shown that the drugs contained in JPBS show antitumor properties and can improve immune function [37]. Astragalus contains polysaccharides that can stimulate the production of TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor) by macrophages, alter levels of NO, increase expression of cytokines, and promote the proliferation of T-cells [38]. Another study showed that the active ingredients of Astragalus (huangqi) mucosal immune function can improve and enhance the killing ability ofNK cells [39]. Angelica (danggui) affects the immune func- cell killing activity, increase T-cell level, and promote immune function via the unique biological activity of the Codonopsis polysaccharide [41].

This meta-analysis suggested that JPBS intervention indeed improves the clinical effect and the quality of survival(KPS) and strengthens the immune function (CD3+, CD4 +, CD8+,C D 4+/CD8+,N K+, and macrophages). Additionally, JPBS reduced the adverse effects of chemotherapy suchas blood toxicity (WBC, PLT, and 0 10 20 MD108642SE(MD)0 Figure 10: Funnel plot of immune function. syndrome, and bone marrow suppression.

There are some limitations of this study that preclude us from reaching definite conclu- sions. First, according to the statement published by themembers of the International Committee of Medical JournalEditors in September 2004, all clinical trials are required to beregistered in a clinical trial registry before enrolling subjectsin the study [43]. This registration should be describedin the publication. However, none of the included studieswas registered. Second, the methodological quality of theincluded RCTs was generally low. Most of them do notdescribe allocation concealment and blinding, which limitthe credibility of the results. Publication bias may be present.Third, high clinical heterogeneity could lower the reliabilityand validity of the research results. Fourth, most of theseincluded studies were published in Chinese journals, limitingthe potential extrapolation of the results. Finally, the searchstrategy may not identify all relevant studies. Given these lim-itations, additional well-controlled large studies are requiredto confirm these findings. 5.
