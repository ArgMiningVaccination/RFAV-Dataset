Mindfulness is a type of present moment awareness \u2014 it's a state of focused, open attention. When you're mindful you observe your thoughts and feelings objectively, without judging them as good or bad. Mindfulness is awareness in action, awakening to your here-and-now experience. Mindfulness practice is a very useful tool in understanding and managing emotional and psychological difficulties. Mind-body integrative practice \u2014 sometimes known as mind-body-spirit or holistic experience \u2014 is also very useful in finding peace and serenity in a stressful life. Mindfulness and mind-body practices are especially useful for: - Reducing anxiety and the harmful effects of stress - Overcoming phobias, OCD, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders \u00b7 Reducing or eliminating the symptoms of depression - Improving focus and concentration (including ADD) - Chronic pain and other physical problems - Addictions and chemical dependency \u00b7 Managing relationship distress \u00b7 Performance enhancement (sports, test taking, etc.) There are lifelong benefits from regular mindfulness and mind-body practice. The results from medical research have been significant. What practicing Buddhists have known for centuries has been tested repeatedly in recent years and the findings are strikingly positive. People who meditate or practice other integrative mind-body methods on a regular basis live longer, are far less anxious and depressed and have fewer medical problems.
