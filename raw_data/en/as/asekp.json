This study provides a mnpaehensive look at the heroin and the alcohol overdose in British Columbia by matyziq reports completed by the coroner and the toxicolc@st. In total. 1029 drug toxicology reports (representing approximatety 95% of ail cverdose deaths that mumd between 1984 to f993), and 30 coronefs files (randomly selected from the last three pars of the study) were analyzed- The t~xiootugy reports provide a comprehensive portrait of the kinds of dfitgs in decedents at the time of their death, and their concentrations; acmrdingiy, a pharmamtogicai understanding of these deaths is provided. An anafysis of the coroner\" files increases our understanding of these death further, by drawing attention to the context of drug oonsumption, including the individual, social, economic, and medical factors associated with it. Similar findings have been report& by several rsearcfiefs, both in North America arid in ttwe @iq+ of crirni~dkzatb:: has 6:arnaticatly increased the dangers of heroin, including the risk of overdose- DEDICATION.

These deaths occurred in B.C. between 1984 and 1993. Legal drug overdoses refer to deaths officially attributed to alcohol, our favarite intoxicant in North America; itfegaf drug overdoses refer to deaths officially attributed to heroin, the most feared of all illegal drugs. Alcohol overdoses remained relativeiy stable in the province between 1984 and 1993 (hovering between 32 and 47 deaths annually), while heroin overdoses have climbed dramaticafly. In 1984, 13 deaths were attributed to heroin; by 1993, more than 300 were (see figure I). This represents an increase of more than twenty three-fcM Nonetheless, an analysis of reports completed by coroners and toxicologists indicates that alcohol can be as dangerous (and frequently more dangerous) than heroin. This is because the dangers asmiat& with these drugs - including the risk of overdose - are not intrinsic to them. Rather, they are a consequence of the context of consumption: most alcohol and heroin overdose subjects were poor, had an extensive history of drug abuse, and were suffering from several medical conditions -- all factors that increase the odds of fatal intoxication. My findings also suggest that a policy of criminalization, rather than decrease the danglers a-ated with heroin, have increased them -- significantly- Heroin Overdoses: 1 984-1 993 3 50 Figure 1 2 The use of opium, from which both morphine and heroin are derived, dates back at least as far as 7,000 B.C. to the ancient Sumerians, who described it in very positive terms. An andent Sumerian ideogram of the opium poppy has been translated to mean \"joy\" or \"rejoicingn (Lindsrnith, 1965: 207). Opium was also highly regarded by the ancient Assyrians, Egyptians, arid Greeks -- Mth as a social lubricant and as treatment for a variety of ills, including pain, asthma, coughs, jaundice, and menstrual cramps (Conrad & Schneider, 1980). in fact, opium was so highly regarded in the ancient world that the 2nd century physician Galen, known as \"the fast great Greek physiciann, argued that the drug was a medical panacea (Conrad & Schneider, 1980: 7 1 1). The Romans adopted the use of opium into their diets after conquering the Greeks, using it in much ilae same way as they did, for recreation and as a medicine. By the fa!! of the Roman Empire (circa 6th czi;ttiry A.D.j, opium use was widespread at1 across Europe, a testament to the enormous cultural iMuewe of the Romans. Paracelstis, the famous 7 6th century Swiss physician, also regarded opium as a panacea for a host of human ailments, Wing it tk 'stone of irnmortaliry\" (Conrad & Schneider, 1980: 1 12). Coleridge acknowledged that his famous poem, \"Kubla Khan\", originated from a dream under its influence- Other English literary figures, including John Keats, Elizabeth Barret Brcwniq, and Charles Dickens, as we!l as their French counterparts, Baudelaire, de Nervaf. and Victor Hugo, were also opium users (Lee & S hlain, 1992)- Whib qim had heen in widespread use tbrougbut Europe since the time of ftre Romans. & did mE #xmme popular in Nom America until the j!X@ century. This is when it became available over the counter in drug and grocery stores, and by maif order, contained in various tonics and elixirs (Brecher, 1972; M&o, 1973)- Marketed under names such Cherry Pectural, Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, and Godfrey's Cordial, these concoctions were acketised as pain killers, cough mixtures, and even as \"soothing syrups\" for imirrg infants {Brecher, 1972)- it is not at all surprising that they became very popular in the New World: physicians began portraying them -- just as their medical counterparts did centuries earlier - as if they were \"God's Own Medicinen (McWSttiams, 1993). Opium could also be smoked; this form of use was confined rnw to the Chinese. Modern Refinements: Inttducing morphine and heroin. fi was after 3% iisirdiion of ckfiv'aii-ie~ cif opium - mopnliirie and heroin -- that probiems associated with the use of opiates emerged. Wore this there does not seem t~ be any evidence of widespread addiction or problems associated with use (Comad & Schneider, 1980; Duger, 1970). One of the reams is likeiy pkmaoldogical: morphine is about 10 times as potent as opium, white heroin is at least three times as potent as morphine. While considerably more potent than morphine, heroin quickly breaks down (metablines) into maphim after injection more dangerous- Administered intravenously, it is delivered into the blood stream far more quickty than by tonics or elixirs. As a result, the drug's effects are consiuerabiy more pronounr=ed. The world\" first morphine addict was the wife of the man who invented the hypodermic syringe (Weil & Rosen, 1983: 82). tntrtvenous injection also increased the medical uses of morphine, and soon \"frnfedicaf journals of the day were replete with glowing descriptions of the effectiveness of the drug\" for many of the health complaints treated by physicians in the ancient world (Cloyd, 1982: 21). Anecdotes gleaned from the notebooks of 19th century physicians suggest that the majority of users of this period were 'iiteraity recruited into addiction, albeit unintentionally, through the liberal and careless use of opiates in medical treatment\" (Conrad & Schneider, 1980: 1 14). With few other drugs available, physicians tended to rely on the opiates. A report to the Iowa State Board of Hestttt-t in 1885 made the point that: The habit in a vast majority of cases is first formed by the unpardombfe cardessness of physicians, who are often fond of using the tittie syringe, or relieving every ache and pain by the administriisrr sf an opiate ji-iuil, 1885it974, cited by Conrad & Schneider, 1980: I 14). Morphine and heroin were even toutsd as cures for atcohot addiction. As Weif & Rosen (3983: 84) report, \"the physical consequences of long-term narcotics use are minor compared to those of aicoholn. A 19th century physician put it this way: f decided these symptoms [acute gastritis, jaundice, liver trouble, and possibly heart disease] were due to overuse of atcoholic drinks. and that an alcohofic cirrhosis was developing. The subject wotifd not drink whiskey when he had morphine, and as he already had a Wit for morphine i decided that by prescribing morphine for him he would get along better (Cited by Brecher, l97Z:f 0)- These eomrnetnts ars as We *Loday as ifiey were then. Provided heroin has not n a by 6 a*, am that the Ussf maintains habits of hygiene and nubeion, addidon to the drug is typically not associated with serious social and medical problems common to the *junkien of the 20th century. Brecher (1 972) reports that substituting morphine (and later heroin) for alcohol seems to have helped many aicoholics switch from a drug that is physically toxic when used habikiatly to one that is not. it seems it is not heroh per se that to probhs for users, it is heroin under 20th century conditions of illegafity Rosen, 1983). While opium smoking was the first form of an opiate to be criminalized, its dangers are less than those associated with either morphine or heroin. Smoked opium is typically fess potent than either i.v. morphine or heroin consumption; users can titrate (or regulate) the dose being consumed. Despite widespread avaiiabiiity, it is estimated that only about 1% of the population became sericrusfy addicted to any of the opiates in the ?9th century (Alexander, 1990). This fact seems to have ken missed by most advocates of criminal prohibition- -ke contemporary distinction m~de bebeen legal drugs such as atcohol, and illegal ones, such as heroin, is not ba-sed upon pharmacology Fie to do 'dYith ffie actual hams associated with the use of these drugs (Boyd, 1993; Mitchell, 1991 ; Szasz, 1975; Trebach, 1993: 24). Nmethdess, most peapte believe heroin to be the prototypical dangerous drug. This is due, in large part, to the continued propagation of a mythology about heroin use, as well as a misteading stereotype of the typical heroin user. The Emergence of Criminal Sanctions Against Opiate Use. Laws proscribing opiate use were based upon a mythology about the drug, and its users. Both structural factors and individual agency help explain how this rnythoiogy arose- Structural factors include a major economic downturn, widespread racial hostility, and the influence of a major Moral Reform Movement. Individual factors include moral entrepreneurs, such as Maekenzie King and Ernify Murphy. A stereotype that Mined opiate (and later heroin) use as sociaNy, morally, and physically reprehensible, and thus in \"nee of criminal prohibition, emerged in the context of these conditions. 13th century Canada was evolving from a largely rural, lightly populated, mmerciat society, into an urban, more populated, industrial society. Men me to the frontier for the opportunity to participate in the Gold Rush, as well as to engage in logging, mining, and railroad construction. The enormous number of men who journeyed to the frontier for employment produced a highly unbalanced sex ratio, which encouraged \"an episodic Mestyle in which hard labour under primitive living conditiocs alternated with periods of Monistic enjoyme& -- incttiding the habitual use of almhol and the opiates (GiEen el ai., 19% : 48) The \"work hard - piay harg attitude seems to have ken popular. Soon, however, increasing numbers of \"respectable\" elites @.g. businessman, and religious leaders) began settling in these areas promoting an ethos of hard work, virtue, and civic responsibility. The %donism\" of ti-e first seMers was soan seen as a vice, inirniml to Ike Saisii&y of the settlements, and most importantly for these reformers, Christian morality. Reform Movements Thus, the first factor imporlzlnt to understanding the emergence of antharmtic fegisfation in Canada is the success of a major Moral Reform Movement. The Movement emerged in the 19th century led predominately by fundamentalist and evangelical Protestant clergymen, most of whom were middle class, and white (Giffen et al., 1991; Kinney & Leaton, 1991). These \"moral entrepreneurs\" (Becker, 1963) envisioned a harmonious world plagued by sickness, crime, violence, alcohol, and drug abuse -- and sought to eliminate these problems through law and sociaf reform. Economics The second factor important to understanding the emergence of this legislation is the economic backdrop. The 19th century gave birth to inddstrialism, and job became very plentiful; in fact, for many years there were more jobs availabie than there were employees to fill them. As a result, when \"Canadian :-A= =&..K rt EUUDLE:CZ&S me looking for ckqj l-ui to biiiid the inidustries & western Canada, thy cam China, Merhg faburers about ten times the amcant they mM earn for comparable work at home\" (Floyd, 1993: 6). Some brought the practice of smoking opium to westem Canada, a pastime initially regarded as nothing more than an unpleasant -- yet certainly tolerable -- habit. \"fTloferance for the habit of smoking opium lasted only as long as British Coimbia's tolerance fur the Chinese\" however (Boyd, 1993: 27). When the Chinese first began to settie in frontier towns in numbers (during the middle of the 19th century) neither their habit of smoking opium, nor their cutture were seen as a prublem. As the number of Chinese increased, bowever, and competitbn f-3: jobs escalated, fears of an \"alien invasionn became common (Comack, 1991). The economic boom that characterized the mid-1800's soon waned, and by the late 1890's, the Chinese - initially seen as a labour asset to the burgeoning economy -- were resented. This resentment eventually prompted the Vancouver Trades and Labor Council to form the Asiatic Exclusion League (A.E.L.), whose goal was to reduce the patitical and economic power of the Asian minority (Comack, 1991 ; Giffen et ai-, 1991). The group successfully lobbied for \"head taxes\" (lump sum payments Asian immigrants had to pay in order to gain access to Canada) and were also influential in having the Franchise Act amended to bar \"any person of Mongoiian or Chinese Raen from voting in a federal election. (Cited by GHen et a!. , I991 : 54)- Anti-Asiatic sentiment in the US., and attention to the Chinese habit of smoking opium, increased when the economic situation worsened there as we8 (Cbyd, 1983). Whife initially the Chinese and their habit of smoking opium attracted little public attention, by the early 1900's the media began portraying them as an alien group, with an'evil\" addiction to smoking opium. Opium smoking was seen as an intolerable habit, threatening the cultural and moral \"superiority\" of the dominant white-european way of life. Judge Emily Murphy wrote a series of articles for Macleans Magazine, later collated and published as The Black Candie. Whife Murphy approached the phenomenon of drug use with genuine concern, marshaling \"significant social: medical, statistical and pharmacolugical data ... her style tended more to sensationalist rhetoric than impartial repoftagen (Green, 1986: 31). It was also racist. Murphy argued tbat \"there is a well-defined propaganda among the aliens of color to bring about the degeneration of the white ram*' through spreading the \"evil\" habit of smoking opium (Cited by Green, 1986: 32). A \"moral panic\" (Cohen, 1980) emerged. Murphy's book, and several magazine articles written for Macleans Magmhe, played upon the latent fears of the Chinese, and other racial minorities- She seems to have been especially concerned about the fate of white women, arguing that in the Chinese opium dens \"the seduction of women addicts becomes easy ... Under the influence of the drug, the women loses controi of herseif; her moral senses are blunted, and she 'becomes a 'vidm' in more senses than one\" (Cited by GRen et at., 199 : i52j. The Back Candie shows a picture sf a biack man lying on a bed next to a white women with an opium pipe between them. The caption beneath the picture reads: \"When she acquires the habit, she does not know what lies More her, later she dues not care\". Murphy, who seems to have represented the views of many in authority at the time, proselytized that opium use inevitably led to \"moral degeneration, crime, physical and mental deterioration and disease, inteflect~al and spiritual wastage, and material loss through drug-induced negligence\" (Green, 1986: 31). This set of beliefs -- known as the \"dope fiend mentality\" -- became rooted in the popufar imagination, despite lack of sound medical or scientific support. Even Sir Matthew Begley, the Chief Justice of B.C., was ignored when he f altogether disbelieve in any widespread mischief here from opium ... ff arty Chinese here abused the drug by over- indulgence, they must hide themselves, or at all events they have entirely escaped my observation ... Opium, as generally used here is probably as harmless as tobacco, which is also exte~sively used in British Columbia ... Neither opium nor tobacco extend in their evil evil effects beyond the individual. They are not so dangerous to ik public peace as whiskey ... All the evils arising from opium in British Coiumbia in a year do not, probabty, equal the damage, trouble, and expense occasioned to individuals and to the state by whiskey in a single month, or perhaps in some single nig~ (Cied by Giffen et a]., 1991 : 58). The Existential Reality of the Dope Fiend Stereotype. Many Asians, being poor, settled alongside other economicatiy marginalized groups in the low rent districts of the province. in some places the areas resembled ghettos, the same piaces immigrant Asians settled in the US. (Cloyd, 1983). Pubtic heat& is typically very poor in these areas (Jones et al., 1988)- The character of many opium den patrons helps explain the (m'is)aWbution of several social problems to opium -- and the subsequent mergence of the dope fiend mentality. Many opium den habitues suffered from pr health; however, beyond the dangers associated with ingesting smoke, none of these health consequences result from the opium. Phzrrnacotqicaliy the opiate family of drugs is remarkably safe. Opium use does not lead to any permanent physiological or mental deterioration (Aiexander, 1990; Krivanek, 198%). The dens were often in the back rooms of Chinese shops in the inner cities, hiding them from the police and the population at large, making tkm \"a kind of vagabonds' inn, a friendfy and safe refuge for itinerant safesman and actors, as well as for underworld e\";raractersn (Biadweii, 1988: 232). ft seems the chara&e- of fk opium den patron - not the opium - was the real target of concern. The dope fiend mytfiotogy , as Alfred tindsmith noted more than half a century ago, is \"a body of superstition, btf-truths and misinformation wbich bolsters up an indefensible repressive law. the victims which are in no position to protesf' (Cited by Giffen et al- , 199 1 : 149). The dope fiend mmlogy became pupular because it played upon anti-Asian sentiments, and was based upsn a very small kernel of truth: police proclamations about gambling and other criminal activity associated with the opium dens were true. Police -- who provided the information Emily Murphy used to write her articles -- were also frustrated by their iMit&y to penetrate the tight knit Asian comrnun-Q. Cultural and hnguage barriers made gathering information on these activities difficult @Hen et a!., 19% ). The historical record suggests that opiate users became a scapegoat for a number of social, economic, racial, and criminal problems. Some physicians, ackm~ing the gambling, and other activity associated with opium, attempted to put these activities into perspective, to offer a more Nwathekss, the media and the argued that opium was the 'Chinese evir\", ?kt it cawed aime and other serious socia! and medical problems. And, with very few exceptions these claims me? with littie resistance. The social and ec~mic situation of many opium den patrons meant they were unlikely to be effective at cxwrrincEng iMluentiai mod entrepreneurs about the Bue ph;vrna@ob$cai cbr2cXeri~ of opium. TRe few prominent citizens that $id speak out seem tu have been ignored. Because many opium den habitues were socially and economically marginalized, it became easy tcr argue that the opium saused these &md%or?s. it was aka convenient. The fate 19th century was characterizes by irrcreasirrg emnomic irrsewrity and racial tension, conditions that helped the white, Euro-Canadian majority Iatch onto the dope believe -bfaekeac#inefienclf\"- The US., like was in an eammic dawnturn during the latter part of the f 9th m%u=ry, sad- as In Canada, this insecurity helped to stir racial by tfe rising bda& mnacrrsness- responded with Mchings and other forms of \"frontier justice\" (Weisbrot; f 9%). These tensions also helped lead an bia&s, just ;is sirnifa tensions crauW Canadian tawmakers to enact laws to mine fiw -- a btack man elm to do unspeakable things while under the argued that coGairre &sve bla& men \"witd\", made them prone to crime, 39.73)- One US. Congressman argued that \"the use of cocairte by the negrues of the South is one of the most e!usive and tmub!esome questions which confront the enforcement of the law in most of the Southern states\" (Cited by Cloyd, 1982: 53). The fear that black men under the influence of cocaine were more likely to rape white women also became part of the emerging dope fiend mythofogy; it was suggested that the uncontrofiable desire for cocaine among blacks helped to unleash their allegedly inherent bestial forces of lust and rage (Cfoyd, 1982: 31). These beliefs, while erroneous, were even propagated by the American Pharmaceutical Association 2 Both the myth of the \"Btack cocaine fiend\", and the myth of the \"Chinese dope fiend\", were rooted in racial tension: Biacks in late 19th century America (like the Chinese) were becoming increasingly vocal about their second-class citizenship, chalienging years of social oppression. The lived experience of ---.a -A. r r rat ty puiie Mcers urtdoubleeify involved confiic'rs with blacks, heiping to +he white- major-f. Bia&s were cMienging the status quo, and alongside it, the belief that they were inferior to whites. A scapegoat, such as the black cocaine fiend, helped to divert attention from the tensions this evolution in consciolrsness precipitated. Propagating the dope fiend mythology helped to generate support for policies designed to curtail the social and political power of Blacks, just as the same mythology shored up support for antiAsian 2 Throughout the 199h \"ahnost tfre whole of scientific thought in both America and Empe . med race inferkrity\" (Men, 1971, Cited by DWi, 1 992: 1 1 83). In 1902 the Psmerka~~~ - - reported that *the use of ... by negroes in certain parts of \u20achis awntry, is simply appalling ..- The police officers of these questionable districts teli wW~]~areW#riMWoocainem(~edbyGtoyd, 198236). 15 iegisiation in Canada, such as head faxes, and voting disqualifications. A Riot Erupts in Chinatown The Asiatic Exclusion League (A.E.L.), an organization constructed to eliminate the \"yellow periln through lobbying for more restrictive immigration policies (Giffen et al., 1 Wl), organized a demonstration in Chinatown in 1907 to ptibficize their views. It quickly turned into a confrontation between the Asian opium merchants and the demonstrators. What had started out as a peacefu! demonstration quickly turned into a melee, and apparently a riot. Several people were injured, and substantial property damage was incurred by Chinese and Japanese business owners, who submitted claims for damages the government (Comack, 1991 ). The federal government sent Mackenzie King (then deputy minister of Labour) to look into the situation, and report back to the federal government. According to a Vancouver Provrince story, when Mackenzie King arrived in Vancouver he was surprised to \"receive claims for $600 each from two Chinese opium merchants for six days loss of business as a result of the rioting\" (Comack, 1991 : 48). Prior to arriving in the city King was apparently unaware of the opium dens that been opened by the Chinese. \"I will look into this drug business\", King reported. 'It is very important that if Chinese merchants are going to cany on such a business, they should do so in a strim tegal way\" (Cited by Boyd, 1993: 28). Initially, at least, King seems :9 have had tittie interest in prohibiting the sale of opium. Several days later, \"after receiving a deputation of Chinese Christian clergymen and merchants interested in anti-opium legislation\", he seems to have changed his mind (Boyd, f 993: 28) 'We35 gef some gotrd out of this riot yet\" he would later vow (Comack, 1991 : 48). King submitted his report about the riot to the federal government, as weti as the claims for economic compensation he received from the opium den merchants. Comack (1991) concludes that Mackenzie King suggested that the riot in Vancouver was precipitated by a \"moral\" or \"normative\" problem involving the Chinese Wit of smoking opium. King, it seems, accepted the interpretations of the police ai r clergymen that opium was an extremely dangerous drug, capable of causing several social, medical, economic, and criminal problems, rather than defining the problem in terms of a shrinking labour market, and the economic insecurities and racial animosities that it hetped to generate. King returned to Ottawa, argued that a ban on opium was urgently needed, and in less than three weeks Rodolphe Lemieux (the minister of labour) successfuily introduced legislation in the House of Commons. The Opium Act of 1908 , Canada's first anti-narcotic law, was enacted vvithout debate (Comack, 1991 ). If Mackenzie King trufy believed the rhetoric about opium beiq the morally corrupting drug responsiMe for the problems in Vancouver in 1908, within a year he had good restson to reconsider them. In his diary for 1909 King notes m: Sowe prsiii13 were af the opinion that opium was used by many of the Sikhs in the me way that Lord Morley was using the cigar which he smoked; that it did rtot appear to harm them in that dimate when used in moderation; that if taken from them it might lead to other drugs king used- Lord Morley would give me the names of one or two gentlemen to wbom I could speak freely as I7 ta conditions in India. They would give me a true statement of conditions, not to be given, for example, to the people in North *viiaIterbo [King's mWoencyj, but whicn i might fburier] (Ciied by Boyd, 1993: 30). Unfortunateiy, this kind of information about opium was never discussed publicly by the government. The image most commonly presented in the media (by police, and otfxws, like Emily Murphy) emphasized the dope fiend mentality. While erroneous, it had become salient in the popular imagination, ensuring continued public support for criminalization. Perhaps the most significant consequence of prohibition occurred almost immediately following c;r!mim!ization: mnsurnpthr! of morphine and heroin -- both considerably stronger than opium -- increased (Boyd, 1993). Criminalization, rather than reduce drug use, simpfy forced users to switch to the remaining legal opiates. Subsequent Legislation In 191 I the federal government enacted The Opium and Drug Act, which banned morphine and heroin, except for \"medical or scientific purposes\". This had the effect of pushing alf opiate manufacture and distribution underground. And while it seems \"quiet arrangements could be made for 'respectable' addicts to receive drugs\" from physicians (Giffen et a]., 1991 ; 36), the poor were immdiatdy forced to rely upon criminal sources. Physicians regarded middle and upper ckss opiate users as \"good citizens who have become addicted to the we of the drug inmcenlly, and who are in every sense of the word WShns' (Cited try Duster, 1976: 11). The less afffuent, often suffering from social, medical, and legat problems linked with their economic position and other drug taking behavior 0.e. alcohol and tobacco), were defined as 'dope fiends\". One docror explained that these opiate users include \"all of the .... In these cases, morphine addiction is a vice ...\" (Cited by Duster, 1970: 11). Several other legislative changes -- concerned mostly with increasing penalties for drug users and expanding poke powers -- occurred subsequent to the 191 1 Act (see Giffen et ai., IWI). Most were collated into the Narcotic Control Act (1 9611, our current drug law. The Media and the Propagation of Drug Stereotypes. Today the media and the police continue to propagate the myth of the \"dope fiend*. As the Chief Coroner of B.C., Vince Caine, notes: \"the media portrays the most visibfe, most overtly controversial, most socially, and economically depressed p-fe as addicts\" and tends to ignore drug users who have remained \"invisible\" to official scrutiny (British Columbia, 1994: 1). Since most people obtain information about illicit drugs from television (Ericson et al., f987), it is not surprising that many believe that use of heroin at!tomatically leads to several social and medical problems for users. The dope fiend mentality lives on. Our tendency to rely uncritically on the media, and drug stereotypes, helps us avoid realities that are more complex -- and less understoaf - than we are cornfortabhe acknowledging. As Powers (1990: 8) argues, \"it3 a sxpxpat be found, jet a culprit be punished and the public :&axes, confiderit if& the cfisis has ken sormoumeC. The War on Drugs has made heroin a scapegoat for a slew of social problems, and has diverted our aSenlbn from the Wt range of cases of these problems. Criminal justice system officiafs have also propagated these beliefs. One U.S. To be a anfirm& ... [heroin] addict is to be one of the walking dead .... The teeth have rotted out, the appetite is lost, and the stomach and the intestines don't function properiy.The gall bladder becomes inflamed; eye and skin turn a bilious yellow; in some cases membranes of the nose turn a flaming red; the partition separating the nostrils is eaten away -- breathing is difficutt. Oxygen in the blood decreases; bronchitis and tubercutusis develop. Good traits of character disappear and bad ones emerge. Sex organs become affected. Veins collapse and livid purplish scars remain. Boils and abscesses plaque the skin; gnawing pain racks the body. Nerves snap; vicious twitching develops. Imaginary and fantastic fears blight the mind and sometimes complete insanity results. Often times, too, death comes -- much too eary in iife .... Such is the torment of being a drug addict; such is the plague of being one of the walking dead (Cited by Breckr, 1 972: 21 ). Like all drugs, there are side-effects associated with the use of heroin. The above description, however, totally misrepresents them. First, despite the stereotype (and as notsot earlier), heroin does not produce any permanent physioIogicaf damage (Alexander, 1990; Trebach, 1993; Weil & Rosen, 1983). This medical fact \"is virtually unchallenged among medical researchers. It is based on decades of careful research on thousands of long- time opiate users\" (AfexaWr, 1990: 150). However, chronic heroin use can lead to constipation, a reduced sexual libido, and cessation of menstruation in fernates. Ail of these effects are transient, however, and disappear when use is discontinued (Aiexarzder, 1990). Compared to chronic use of alcohol (which can lead to cirrhcisis of the liver, hormonal imbalances, and severe physilogicai damage to virtually every major organ in the body) chronic use 3 The comments are taken frrwn tfte US. case, Robinson v- California, 370. US. EX)., (I W), cited by Brecher f 1973). 20 of unadulterated heroin is, medically speaking, safer Most of the effects erroneously attributed to heroin are caused by other drug taking behavior, conditions created by the War on Drugs, or failure to maintain a healthy diet (Alexander, 1990; Krivanek, 1988; Trebach, 1993; Weit & Rosen, 1983). For example, liver pathologies -- common to the 20th century heroin user -- are typicaiiy caused by chronic alcohol abuse, while lung and heart problems are often caused either by the adulterants that are combined with the drug when it is sold iifegafly, or by tobacco abuse. Most of the remaining disease states resuR when virus-contaminated needles are shared, or when a user is unable to maintain a healthy diet. This study, using autopsy and drug toxicology data from the B.C. Coroner's Service, makes these issues explicit. The Stucfy. This study provides a comprehensive look at heroin drug overdose in B.C. i mmpare these findings to the alcohol overdose. The findings suggest that the popular perception that heroin is inherently dangerous is erroneous: autopsy reports indicate that aimhot is far more toxic when used chronically than heroin. As a result, the study challenges the contemporary distinction made between these two drugs ti-e. legal versus illegal) and the decision to employ the cdrninal Eaw to reduce tfie abuse ut these substances. This distinction, and the criminaiizanon of opiate drug users, is based upon a mythoiogy about heroin and a stereotM>e af users moreso than concerns for public health. In tfre Memalogy Chapter that follows, the personnel involved in the drug overdose investigation are introduced, the process of gaining access to the data 55 diswsd, and fke research modalities used to collect the data are explained. CHAPTER TWO: METHODOLOGY, hiroduction This is an exploratory study, aimed at providing a comprehensive portrait of the nature and causes of deaths officially attributed to heroin. It accomplishes this, in part, by comparing these deaths to a sample of alcohol overdose deaths that occurred during the same time period. This chapter introduces the major actors invohed in these overdose investigations, including the police, the forensic pathologist, the toxicologist, and the coroner. The chapter also describes methods wed i~ ammpt'rsh the goats of the research, as well as the process of gaining access to drug overdose data in B.C. l also describe some of the procedures used by the Coroner's Service to conduct their own study into heroin overdoses in the province (British Columbia, 1994), in order to highlight the pervasiveness of the cultural bias in favour of legal drugs. Finally, the chapter concludes by summarizing the limitations of the study. Major Actors Involved In the Overdose Investigation. The police are often the first investigators to attend the scene of a suspected overdose. They will look for evidence at the scene that might suggest the nature and cause of death, including a search for drugs (e-g. heroin, atcobl). In cases where iliicit drugs, such as heroin, are involved police will also look for drug parapknaiia (e-g. syringes) that may suggest the mode of adminisffation. Where alcohol is thought to be involved poke will note whether evidence of alcohol use was present at the scene (e-g. liquor bottles). In addition, poke interviews with witnesses (if available) often help to determine the evenfs prior to the overdose, and their history of alcohol andfof iflicit drug use. This information, helpful in providing context to these deaths, is summarized in a \"Sudden Death Report\" which is submitted to the coroner. The Forensic Pathokgiist Where a death has occurred suddenly, or unexpectedly, a forensic pathologist will conduct a postmortem (autopsy) examination on the decedent in an attempt to establish the mechanisms involved in the death. This generally includes a microscopic analysis of body tissues, and a macroscopic analysis of the major organs (e-g. liver, lungs, heart). In deaths thought to be eamed by drugs the pathologist will also extract bodily fluids and submit them for analysis to the Provincial Toxicology Centre, where toxicologists will perform assays to determine the kinds of drugs in the body, and their postmorfem levels in most cases blood is extracted since it is the best indicator of current drug use; however, in cases where major decomposition makes the blood untenable, the pathologist will extract urine, vitreous fluid, bile, or sections of the liver in an attempt to ascertain if drugs were involved in the death. A copy of the report completed by the pathologist conducting the autopsy examination is then submopsy~ed to the coroner. A toxicotogist (after receiving a sample of blood drawn from the decedent) will determine whether drugs are present, and if so, what their mncentrations are. the Provincial Toxicology Centre relies upon established lethal guidelines when determining if a particular drug concentration was kety the cause of a decedent's death. These guidelines are based upon \"cumulative case reports and experience from worid wide literature generated by laboratories associated with coroners or medical examiners offices\" (Carlyle, 1993:2). International forensic experience with deaths associated with drugs -- whether legal or iflegal -- indicates that a wide range of drug concentrations characterize these deaths. These include coroner's cases where overdose deaths have been attributed to drugs at below established lethal levels and where quantities of drugs have been detected far in excess of them. In cases where lower than fethaf drug levels have been found existing medical conditions, the presence of other drugs, as well as recent loss of drug tolerance, are often factors in these deaths. The Coroner Coroners are lay persons appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council upon the recommendation of the provincial Attorney General. They are responsible for establishing the identity of the decedents, when and where tf-tey died, and the caw3 of death. These include deaths that have occurred in a va~ety of contexts, induding: disaster situations, motor vehicle accidents, aM unexpected deaths - whether from disease, sickness, drug overdose, or unknown causes. Coroners obtain the authority to conduct these investigations from the Coroners Act (R.S. Chapter 68). Section 16 of the Coronets Act states: A coroner or a medical practitioner or a peace officer authorized by a coroner to exercise all or any of his powers under this subsection, may (a) view or take possession of any dead body, or both; and (b) enter and inspect any place where a dead body is and any piace from which the coroner has reasonable grounds for believing the body was removed. The hroners Act also autbofizes coroners to review the findings of the police, the pathologist, and the toxicologist. Section 16(2) of the Coroners Act states that a coroner may: (b) inspect information in any records relating to tbe deceased or his circumstances; (c) seize anything that the coroner has reasonable grounds to believe is material to the investigation. Thtls, the m;oner7s ihai determiriatior; r>f the cause oi death in cases involving drugs is anchored in evidence provided by the police, the pathologist, and the toxicologist. The coroner reviews the findings of these professionals and summarizes them in a report called \"The Final Judgment of Inquiry\" which fonns tfte qualitative component of this study. The quantitative component relies upon the toxicologist's report. Getting In: Gaining Access to the Data. fn aWin to the data mttected, tfie process of gaining access to data sources is wathy of anajysis (Harvey, 1990; Kirby & McKenna, 1989). To obtain data m these overdoses f had to make a written apptication to the B.C. Coroner's Sewice, requesting access, and stating my research focus. I indicated that my Reraftire revfew on dntg tmdmiclrgtr suggested that attributing the cause of death to a dnrg is an extremely compficated process, and that it seemed the exact dnrg kvet required to produce an overdose situation was somewhat i thought this meeting was simply a formati?)! -- a rite of passage, easily wgotiated am! me =f txhe steps that kid t~ 52 taken iG mnduct research in the field. It seems it was more then &is, however. Members of the Curofter's staff suggested to me that my comment, made in my intrsdtidory letter, that \"the exact toxicology required to produce an overdose was somewhat equivocal\" indicated that f bid not fully appreciate the complexities of postmortem toxicology, and that perhaps I did not have the expertis to conduct an analysis of drug toxicotoggr levels. f was told that there were differences between \"clinical\" and \"postmortem\" toxicology, and \"chrunic and \"acute\" s-~erbose deaths. Much of the discussion involved jargon I was unfamiliar with, and seemed designed to obfuscate the fact that, despite all of our ~~7 po~o~ dig levels are men an inexact gauge of tk quantity of drugs in the system at the tSme of death. Nonetheless, being a student 1 left the f;o-i-mi's Mice that day wmde7ing if these prdessimak were right. Who wras 1 to attempt a study when I, based upon their logic, aprentty did not - - have the mxesay samWk mqountf? After all, t was a graduate student Qf: afmier mt meddm m &ximbgy. C discussed this meeting with a number of my peers in the School of Criminobgy at S-F.U_, as well as my academic committee. Some VVirife coroners re@ upan esWSisfoed lethal levels, there is a great deal of controversy within tfre scientific: and medical literature as to their utility in mmlrtg to tms w&h Wse deaths iniefem aiwxri: the rob a parijwiar drug may have playeci in a based upon postmortem drug teveis, are fraught Wh prabierns because a number of factors fe-g. presence of other drugs, disease states, few?! of tolerance) can alter the disposition, concentrations, Pm af drugs in mys mm, postmortem lev&, pet sen are not always helpfui. Other factors must also be considered in the etiokgy of these deaths, including the abuse of other drugs (legal and illegal), and the medicai health of the decedent prior to death. Working at the Chief Coroner's Office gave me an opportunity to talk with members of the Task Force regarding my findings, which proved to be very helpful to me. Some of the Coroner's staff also soticited my input. Consequently, I took this opportunity to suggest that I believed the common view of heroin was, in part, erroneous. 1 also indicated that my review of the toxicology reports from the heroin overdose suggested that aicohol and other drugs were almost always involved in these deaths, something I felt was being downplayed by coroners, perhaps inadvertently. While these deaths are classified as heroin overdoses, only a small minority of decedents had only heroin in their blood at death, suggesting that other drugs may also have been factors in their deaths. After hearing these comments one staff member indicated to me that it appeared that i was trylng to under-estimate the role of hemin in these deaths, and over- emphasize the rok of kit drugs such as aimhol. It was also suggested that the large ntmber of cases involving atcoho! may be a consequence of postmortem decomposition, which can also praduce alcohol. f tk these mmments serioustyI and attempted to ascertain what role, if any, post rnortern decomposition was piayiq in creating alcohol. f contacted Dr. Uu~ef Gray, wb dues the lion's share of heroin overdose autopsies in Vmmwe~.. Dr. Gray agreed t~ meet with me to discuss the matter. Since i itad taken extensive nates on every autopsy case from IWl Dr. Gray was able to cktermSne the liketihad tftitt decomposition was producing alcohol in these cases. After reviewing these files Dr. Gray concluded that decomposition may have been a factor in 4 of these cases, or about 2% of the sample. Thus, it seems that the alcohol detected in the vast majority of cases resulted from atcoho! consumption, not decomposition. The Rep& of the Task Force Into Illicit Narcotic Overdose Deaths. Coincidentally, while i was collecting data for my thesis the Coroner's Service was involved in a study of their own on the epidemiology of illicit drug overdoses. Their study, commissioned by the provincial government ir.. June 1993, led to the publication of the Report of The Task Force Into Iliic~t Narcotic Overdose Deaths in British Columbia. While overall 1 think the report successfully portrays the heroin overdose, the toxicology findings are somewhat misleading. 1 noticed that their toxicology conciusions (British Columbia, 1994: Chapter 2) did not match mine, even though we were looking at the same data The Task Force developed a drug typology that, among other things, suggested about 18% of the heroin overdose deaths (in 1993) involved only heroin, while I had established that only 6% did. When I contacted the Coroner's Service and explained to them this, and other tmimfogical contradictions, f was toid that these discrepancies were likely a consequence of how these cases were \"interpreted by the Task Force\". While the Task force may have determined that there were indeed several drugs in the of a pariiatlar decedent: at death, they elected to present orsty those &ugs that were seen as txmWwtory to the death. Tisirs, bvv drug Ievefs were excfuded from their drug typotogy and their report. The Task Force's Wsions, however, were clearly culturally-biased: below established lethal levels of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and alcohol were not cited, while below established lethal levels of cocaine or morphine always were. Coroners also attributed deaths to heroin in cases where it was only detected in the urine, which was never done in cases where alcohol was only detected there, even though toxicologists agree it is a better indicator of past use than current use (Base&, f983). This highlighted for me the pervasiveness of our cuiturai bias in favour of legal drugs, and that \"our classifications are human impositions, or at teast culturally based decisions on what to stress among a plethora of viable alternativesn (Gould, 1990: 73). While I doubt the Task Force o: the coroners invotved in these cases purposely warned to misrepresent the toxicological reality of these deaths, their findings suggest that this cultural bias is deeply entrenched. The mechanism of death in suspected drug overdoses can be complex. Deaths may result from the toxicity of a single dose or the effects of cumulative doses; polysubstance abuse, existing medical conditions, and loss of tolerance, can further increase the odds an overdose will occur. Further still, because of the nature of drug after death, it is often difficult to rely upon postmortem drug tevets when coming to conclusions about the role a particular drug may have played in a death. Excluding some drugs (i-e. akohol, prescription, Etnd over-the-counter drugs) and not others (i-e. cocaine and heroin) based upon a preconceived notion of which drugs, in the iangiiage of our cutture, have a less favorable image, is not only precarious, but misleading- Research Goals. The first goal of this research project is to provide context to these deaths. This involved analyzing: a number of demographic characteristics; the events -(when known) preceding the overdose; the mode of drug administration (e-g. intravenous, intranasal); the decedent's history of alcohol and/or illicit drug use; and finally, their medical condition prior to death. These factors are significant in terms of understanding the cause of these deaths. Unfortunately, they are sometimes reduced to epiphenamenal status. When someone hears of an \"heroin overdose\" they -- not surprisingly -- infer that the heroin was the primary cause of death. In the context of the \"war on drugs\" the attention is on the drug, rather than the social or medical context of consumption, which, based upon the findings of this study, can be equally importan: etiological factors in these deaths. Ttre second goal is to provide a toxicoiogical analysis uf these deaths, based on both the kinds of drugs associated with these deaths, and their levels. Alcohol overdoses refer to deaths caused by alcohol; however in about one- third of these cases other drugs are also involved. It is likely that these other drugs were contributing factors in many of these cases. Similarly, while heroin overdoses officially refer to deaths mused by heroin, almost all involve more than one drug, suggesting that these other drugs may also have been factors in these deaths. Polysubstance abuse seems to be a significant factor in the doiogy sf these overdose d@aik!s- The third goal; is to discuss these findings in the context of our current @icy of prohibition, or War on Drugs- This policy, while well-intentioned, has created a division between \"acceptable\" drug use (i.e. alcohol) and unacceptable drug use (i-e. heroin). It also suggests that drugs can be inherentiy good or bad. This is a cultural bias inherent in North America that does not stand up to scientific scrutiny. Both drugs can be equally dangerous; however these dangers are more a function of the context of use, than of anything intrinsic to them. Unfortunately much of the wisdom surrounding iegaf and illegal drugs is erroneous and based upon moral, and cultural factors that have little to do with the actual harmfulness of these substances. By downplaying the role of alcohol (and other legal drugs) in some heroin overdose deaths, and over-emphasizing the role of heroin (and other illegal drugs), even when they have been detected at below lethal levels, the culturat bias against heroin (and in favour of alcohol and other legat drugs) is given official support. METHODS. fhe quantitative anatysis invobed collecting drug toxicology information from 395 deaths attributed to a!cotiol, and 654 deaths attributed to heroin. These cases represent app~oxirnateiy 95% of all the aiwhol overdose deaths and 97% of ail heroin overdose deaths reported by the B.C. Coroner's Service. These deaths occurred between 1984 and 1993. The remaining cases were unavailabie beeawe they were being used by employees of the Coroner's Sen/ice, or they were misfiled. Drug toxicology data used in this analysis includes the kinds of drugs detected in the blood of the decedent, as well as their concentrations. Postmortem biood levels were analyzed rather then drug concentrations found in other body parts (e-g. urine, bite, or fiver) because blood is considered the best indicator of current usage (Basett, 1983). The urine, bile and liver may all contain drugs several days after consumption, and are therefore less exact measures of current usage% Toxicology data were gleaned from the toxicoiogy report completed by toxicoiugists, and entered into the computer program, FifeMaker Pro, which was adapted to enter this data- The process gf delemining %hat caused someone to overdose is very complex. Drug overdoses \"are not always explained solely in terms of excessive intake of the drug. One person may die in a given set of circumstances, while another ;nay not\" (British Columbia, 1995:~). Others argue that it is irnpossibk \"to find a drug that will act with compkte uniformity on ail human beings. In order for this to be accomplished, variation, the cornerstone of evolution, and biochemicai individualiw would have to be abdishM (Eckert, 1 =:I 17). Thus, while drug toxicttlugy data piay a role in determining the cause of &?a% in suspected drug overdoses it is often not enough to determine why a person dect. A number of social and medical factors mediate the effect a drug has on the human body- As a result, drug medicat context of consumption. This study attempts to broaden our -randing oi4 akohd and heroin owrboses both through a toxicological understanding of the pharmacological role of certain drugs in a death, as explicated in the quantitative analysis, as well as through a biomedical and social mntext, as explored in the qualitative component of the research. Qualitative Analysis Those who employ qualitative research techniques typically \"reject the idea that a statistical criterion can define explanation or understanding\" (Paiys, 7992: 9). The ~uarttitive analysis provides such a criterion, by describing the average concentrations of the drugs detected in the blood of these decedents. However the wide range of postmortem drug levels found in these cases makes the average postmortem drug levet detected in decedents less then ideal for describing these deaths. in some cases extreme \"outlieT scores, that is, concentrations that are well outside the range of the majority of cases, distmt average drug levek A more complete undersanding of these deaths requires evaluating toxicofogicat findings against the individual context Win which mey exist. This is because sxistirg medical conditions, and the use of other drugs bath mediate the pharmacological effects of these drugs. Death bas not occur in a vaclrirm- The context of these deaths was examined by analyzing an adbitional thirty coroners fites selected from the last Wee years of the study (ie 1991, 7992, 1993). Tk Gorr;merss ffiie is helpful in providing context to these deaths because it stlmMzes the poi-ke report compieted by the police agency investigating the death, and ttre autopsy report oompleted by the forensic pathologist. Both ~~ socia: and medical context to these overdoses, and make the drug toximfogy data mare meaningful. Tbe police report summarized by the coroner provides social context to the overdose by delineating scene circumstances, inciuding information such as the mode of drug administration, some indication of the events prior to the overdosey as wet1 as the decedent's history of drug use. The autopsy report summarized by the coroner provides biomedical context to the overdose by establishing the decedent's medical condition prior to death. Autopsy information also provides a separate index, in the form of organ damage, of the decedent's history of drug use. Content Analysis and Sample Fifteen abhd md iien iiiidt dmg overdose cases5 were selected randomly from a printed fist of fiks covering the years 1991, 1992, and 1993 . The list was provided by the Coroner's Service. Each of these files was then content analyzed. The content analysis involved tallying: (1) a number of common demographic variables, (2) the events prior to the overdose, (3) the history of the decedent's use of alcohoi andlor illicit drugs, and (3) the decedent's medical condition prior to the overdose. Each coroner's file contains a Death Certificate that lists a number of the demographic characteristics of the decedents, including their age, sex, marital status, and occupation. These data were noted for both the alcohol and the illicit drug overdose subjects. The occupation of the decedent listed 5 This fist does not distinguish between kinds of illicit drug overdoses; consequently 3 of these owdo.ses me z&ib&d to cozakre, a nd me was attributed to methadone. When reference is made to this component of the research, the term 'illicit overdose\" is used. 36 on the Death Certificate however is an inexact indicator of the decedent's empfoyment history. This is because it is listed under a sectior! tit!ed, \"Employment Held For Most of Working Lifen. As a result, conclusions based upon tbis demographic characteristic should be made with care: it is possible that the decedent was employed in another occupation at the time of death, or was unemployed. Events Prior To the Overdose Using information typically supplied by the police, coroners attempt to reconstruct the activities that preceded the death as best as possible, and summarize them in the Final Judgment of Inquiry. In some cases this information is less then helpfut, however in others, it provides information that helps explain the death; for example, in several instances it seems the fatal overdose followed a period of abstinence (and therefore reduced tolerance) from dr~g use. I rely upon the cororer's summary of the activities of the decedents prior to death to establish the events prior to the overdose. Since in many cases this information is difficult to establish, the events are not known. This issue is explored further in the Findings Chapter (chapter 4). Medical Health of the Decedents The decedent's medical health was determined by examining the pathologist's autopsy repofl. Only preexisting medical conditions were quantified. Medical complications resulting from the overdose event itself were excluded from the analysis- These medical pathologies were then classified according to whether they were: (1) caused by alcohol abuse, (2) caused by itlicit drug abuse or (3) caused by some other conditions, such as a poor diet or chronic tobacco abuse. Chronic excessive consumption of alcohol, often over several years, results in tissue degeneration in several major organs of the body. Eventually the liver, spleen, and pancreas will enlarge, and may lead to cirrhosis and pancreatitis (Balch & Batch, 1990). As a result, the identification of these conditions at the autopsy examination provides prima facia evidence of medical pathologies caused by alcohol abuse. The following statements provide examples of the physioiogical damage caused by chronic alcohol abuse: \"There was a moderate degree of fatty degeneration in the liver, of a type most frequently associated with chronic alcohol abuse\". \"Fatty metamorphosis of liver consistent with [a] history of alcoh~lism'~. \"His liver was enlarged and showed an established cirrhosis. ..\" Unlike the chronic use of alcohol, the chronic use of unadulterated heroin is not associated with any physiological damage (Alexander, 1990; Krivanek, 1988). Medical problems associated with the chronic abuse of heroin typically result from the substances that it is combined with when it is obtained illegally. The accumulation of these agents in the major organs of the body eventually leads to severe scarring. When this scarring occurs on the lungs it is comrnoniy referred to as 'junkie iung\". These substances (e-g. vatium, lactose, lidocaine) are combined with illicit drugs to increase their volume and profitability. Thus, \"the deleterious effects of the impurities are not a 38 pharmacological effect of the opiates, but rather one of the societal effects that are imposed [upon heroin usersj by ma~ing the pure drug unobtainable\" (Alexander, 1990: f 50). As a result, the following statements, gleaned from the autopsy report, provide prima facia evidence of medical conditions created by our current sociefal response to heroin: \".. . severe Junkie's lung\". \"Sections of the lung showed ... foreign material deposition consistent with known history of intravenous drug abuse\". \"Foreign body granulomas in lungs, liver, and spleenn. Other Medical Conditions In addition to medical conditions associated with the abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs, pathologists identified a number of other medical pathologies at the autopsy examination. These include:H-LV., atheroscebrotic disease, hepatitis B, to name a few. These conditions were also tallied, both for the alcohol overdose subjects and the illicit drug overdose subjects. The Decedent's History of Drug Use lnterwiews made by police of friends, family, andfor treatment personnel help to suggest the decedent's history of alcohol or illicit drug use. In cases where a histwy d akohoI' me Pas &i estbbiisheb, coroners will note that The decedent was a chronic alcoholicn \"The deoedent: had a well documented histofy of abbi abusen Sirnilart y, where evidence f rum f fiends, family, or treatment personnel s'--ts that the decedent had a histay of il!jcit dnug use the momr wi!! typidiy note in !he fife, as in the following examples: \"Friends of the deceased admitted he was a km abuser of narcotics\". \". . . [the decedent was] recently released from a halfway house relative to extenshe heroin use\". Autopsy evidence of organ damage attributed to aicohol abuse (e-g. fatty degeneration of the liver) or the agents that iilicit drugs are commonly combined with (e-g. \"Junkie lung\") provided a separate index or measure of the decedent's history of drug use. In the majority of cases, the decedent's history of drug abuse was supported by both of these ind*mtors. Limitations and Caveats. The first limitation of my thesis is that it does not expiore the voices of living drug users; instead, it focuses upon the dead. While the body of the drug overdose victim can tell as much about the fife of the drug user, it is far from a complete picture. Moreover, a consideration of how drug users themselves interpret their drug use is also important. White no systematic contact was made with dnrg users, I did meet with several current or former heroin usrs. of these mntacts we m-a S~omra!!y t!f-I m!ipe~! wb n?eMmd that I was canduang research into alcohol and heroin overdoses to people who work with alcohol and heroin abusers.

This is because rnedicai problems caused by chronic alcohal abuse (e g. cirrhosis) that typicafty contribute to death in a less acute manner are not recorded as atcohof overdoses- These deaths are classified by the Coroner's Service as \"aicohol-related\" deaths6 . In 1990 2,959 deaths in Canada - while directly attributable to afmbf-r - were cfassified in this manner (Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 1994) These alcohol deaths are not reflected in the atmhof ove~bose statistics mikted by the coroners\" of any of the provinces. nay inadvertentiy help to propagate.

AS. ), estimates ttrere are probabty about 15,WU addicted heroin users in B-C- about 45,000 moderate users, a ratio of about 3:l {M-, 3994)- Dag researchers f stgp&d the num-ks of users sampared to users may be much Iarpr: Trebach (1986) the ratio sf moderate to arMiGted users is about 73, while Zinberg cities rmdr the ratio may be as high as 10:l. Since studies indicate that the ratio of moderate to compulsive alcohol users is about 9:l (Boyd, 1993; Kteiman, 1992) there may be a similar percentage of both users that develop compulsive retationships with these drugs. Much of the prevaiIing wisdom, both about alcohol and heroin, is inaccurate. f teamed this first hand when f explained to an undergraduate class at S.F.U. that whiie alcohol abuse can cause damage to a number of the major organs in the body, unadulterated heroin does not. My comment met with a number of k;witdered looks; the stefeotype of the \"heroin junkie*, and the dope fiend mentality promoted in the media, ciashed with what I was telling them. My ccmment, howwer, has a solid foundation in the medical literature. Unfofiunateiy, in the context of the War on drugs, this literature is often ignore@. Most of the claims about the dangers of heroin are \"exaggerated, unsubstantiated, or untruen (Alexander, 1990: 130). These beliefs perpetuate a mythofogy about heroin use, interfere with attempts to discuss these drugs objectively, and provide support for measures such as the War on Drugs. At the heart of my thesis is a desire to \"strip away some of tbe outworn clutter of fictions\" surrounding both alcohol and heroin, as well as to \"detve beneath ostensive and dominant conceptual frames\" (Harvey, 1993: 18, 4). In North America we face an entrenched double standard. We are bombarded with suphisticated advertisements that fink alcohol consumption with a glamorous and exciting i'cfestyle, while at the same time we face media announcements suggesting \u20achat iffieit drugs such as heroin are \"a repudiation of everything America is\" (Kappeier et a!. , 1993: 149). This study attempts to transcend this rhetoric, and the faise distinction made between legal and illegal drugs. Afcohol and heroin both can be extremely deadly; however the precise nature of their dangers are associated with several factors beyond their pharmacofogical properties. The following chapter presents findings that bear on these points, inciuding the social, medical, and legal context within which these drugs are used. CHAPTER THREE: FINDINGS Opening the Casket. Par\u20ac One: The Social and Medical Context This chapter describes fatal overdoses attributed to alcohol and heroin in terms of the drugs involved in these deaths, as well as the social and biomedical context of consumption. Both perspectives are necessary for a comprehensive undersfanding of the etiology of these deaths. The first part of the chapter, which employs qualitative research techniques, provides social and medical context to these deaths by reviewing: (1) major demographic characteristics of the decedents; (2) events proceeding the overdose; (3) mode of drug consumption; (4) medical condition of the decedent prior to the overdose; and (5) the decedent's history of drug use. Using quantitative research techniques, the second part of the chapter compares drug toxicology data from 375 alcohol overdoses and 654 heroic overdoses. In this section of &,'re st;@ I discuss the kinds of dmp detected in these decedents, as weil as their postmortem levels. Several factors mediate the disposition of drugs in the body after death, making postmortem drug concentrations inexact indicators of the amount of a drug consumed. These factors are also reviewed. While 1 have attempted to reduce the use of medical jargon as much as possible, in several places this has not been possible. Consequently, a gbcay of these terms is provided at the end of the thesis. Demographic Characteristics of the Decedentsi White aicohol and drug use (both ii& and illicit) cuts across socio-economic strata (Canzdian Centre for Substance Abuse, 1994; Le Dain, 1973; Smart, 19831, overdose deaths, whether attributed to aimhof or illicit drugs such as heroin, seem to be owf represented among those occt~pying the tower rungs of the socio-economic iadder. Sirnifar demographic findings have been reported by lngotd (1986) in a study of drug-related deaths in France, and Wong & Alexander (1991), in a st^! in Canada. The demographics of the overdose subjects sbdieci in mis report, including their occupation, age, and marital status, were gleaned from the Deatb Certificate contained in the Coroner's file. The occupation of the decdmt is listed on the Death Certificate under the t&!e, \"Occupation Hefd Fur Most of Working Lifen. As a resuft, it was not possible to confirm wbW the. decedent was employed in this occupation at the time of death. It does indicate, however, that most alcohol overdose subjects (67%, n = 110) and ifffcit drug overdose subjects (67% rt =10) were two cases coroners were u&e to establish what type of employment the cwefdme subject was listed as unemployed at the time of his death, and in mttters the coroner was We to estaMish the type of work the decedent Sex The mr rep^^^ af males - both in atwho! and iflicit drug deaths -- is afmost universal. In a study of aMd deaths in Scotiand, Clark (1 988: 1 88) FP~O~~S that \"just over we mafe and ow third were female\", while KrSngsMm (1988), irt a study of ifti& drug deaths in Denma~k, r.y;>rtt that W! were mate and W! female- Simifar findings ,have been reported by Parker et al., (1988; in England, Kringhsholm & Christoffersen (1 982) in Copenhagen, and Kub e? al. (1991) in Germany. In this study the sex ratio of' both kinds of dece&nt was identical: 73% (n = 1 1 ) were male and 27% (n = 4) were female. Om ot We majw demographic differences found in shrdies of akohol and illicit averdoses is age. AkoW overdose subjects are, on average, older then most ilkit drug averdose vktirns. Cia& (1988) reports that the typical alcohol overdose deaxkmt in his study was 56 years old, white Kringsitolrn (1988) repor& that the ilkit dq ovef- decedent in his study was 31 pars M. Simifiarty, the average age sf the atccd'toi overdose subject in this study W-s itficit drug overdose subjects (n = 7, 47%) were single at the time of their deaths. The remaining tfcoM overdose s w~e em- married (n = 2,1324 or (n = 4, 27%). Ttre remaining iDfSeiS dy overdose subjects were either married (n = 5, S%), separated (n = 1, Tk], or divorced (n = 2, 13%). Caroners are assisled in their investigation of these deaths by police officers through Mir investigatim of the scene of the death, and intentiews with frie- of the decedent- As criminal invesWto;is, t.rowevcx, poke officers are &en mre conoemed &eminling whether foul play or a crime was Lnmkd, than in providing a comprehensive social mait of the decedent.

In these cases, tRecOnfeXrafthe~isvirhraftyim~ibtetoestaMish- Police i~weSiga.tions eS&iisM that the iargest portion of alcohol overdose subjects (47?&, il = 7) were socializing or \"partying\" with others prior to their deafhs (see figure 21, suggesting that for many, alcohol was one of the ftabrkants used in conjermtkm with recreation. Of these, 4 were described as \"pa@ying quite hare or \"drinkhg heavilf prior to 'into tihe eariy burs= with friends at a hotel the evening of his death; another was sociafizing at work with co - workers (the coroner explains that he \"consumed an excessfive] amount of alcohol ... [after] a challenge by a co-worker\"); and in a third situation, the subject, along with a gray of friends, \"had been drinking abhul since the earty morning hours ... beside a shack\" in We undeveloped part of town. The mroner reports that ?his was ;a popular drinking tocatSon for the local indigents, as the open field and the gravel pit m&y were bw traffic areas, hem their gatherings were seidum interrupteda- One death, ironicaily, occurred the day prior to the decedent's scheduled defux. Tt-re coroner reports that he and his girlfriend \"deced tu have a celebratmy drink prior to his admission\", and \"drank most af a 26 ounce boW of rum lbetween ttsem\". Needless to say, their celebration culminated in an overdose She took three Ativans (Le- lorazepam), went to steep, and was discovered dead the next morning. Polydrug intoxications, especia!!y involving C.N.S. depressants, are a frequent characteristic of overdose deaths (British Coiumbia: 1994 Levine et a!.? 1991 et Puschel, 1992; Puschet et a!., 1 992). tn another situation the decedent had been visiting with a friend: during which time he \"consumed a not-known quantity of rum\". He was found unresponsive severai hours later at home. E.M.S.9 was called, we n-sder r=Myained eijn&ousrress. L Fiaure 2: Aztivities of the Alcohol Overdose Subjects Prior to Death. I Socializing Wich Others Events Unclear Drinking Binge In a significant number of alcohol overdose cases (40%, n = 6) the events prior to the overdose are unclear. In these cases it seems subjects either consumed their drugs alone (n = 31, or were found to be \"street people\" (n = 3). In both cases it is very difficult to ascertain a decedent's social history, including the events prior to death. Of those thought to have been consuming their drug alone at the time of their death, coroners report that one subject was discovered dead \"sitting on a toilet seat in a public washroom. His body was leaning against the cubicle wall, fully dressed 2. In another, the coroner reports that the decedent's roommate told police he found the decedent lying on the floor and assumed that the decedent \"had once again passed out white under the influence of aicohol\". The roommate did not become concerned until the next morning, when he found his friend on the floor in the same position. In the last case, the coroner reports that the decedent was discovered unconscious at home by her husband, who indicates that she was also drinking alone. Of those described as \"street peopten, coroners report that one subject was found by a passing citizen \"lying unresponsive in the lanen; one was discovered in a parking lot in East Vancouver; and one was found in Oppenheimer Park, with \"two empty bottles of Ginseng [brandy] . . . next to the subject's body\". Police investigation established that one decedent had been \"on a 30-day drinking binge\" by himself; afterwards he suffered a cardiac arrest. E.M.S. were contacted and he was transported to the intensive care unit (1.C-U.) of the bi hospitaf, where he remained unconscious for a week before dying. in another sItuaQon it seems likely that the overdose was connected to grief over the death af a sister- Critical Me events often promote a risky drug consumption pattern, and have been identified by drug researchers as a significant factor in many overdoses. Puschei et ai. ji993j found that ~h~eiy before death a critical life event (e-g. death of a relative, loss of a job) preceded two-thirds of the drug overdoses they studied. Depression also frequently pre-dates drug abuse and drug overdoses (Weis et al., 1992). In this case the coroner states that the day of the death the decedent: had been informed ... that his sister .. had been dead. [He] was next observed at approximately noon when he entered the hotel lobby. He appeared very impaired. He made his way to a bench, laid down and commenced to sleep. Within minutes he started to snore before falling off the bench to the floor. A short time later he was discovered not breathing and a phone call was made for assistance. The Iilicit Drug Overdose Subject As with the alcohof overdose subjects, a significant portion (33%, n = 5) of illicit drug overdose subjects were socializing with others prior to their deaths. in tkse cases it =rns t.he kroin (like a!cuhol) was a lubricent for recreation. Of these, coroners report that 4 appeared to be \"partying hard\". One \"had injected heroin at 2200 hours and continued to consume alcohol until at least 0500\"; another \"had been drinking and using cocaine [with friends] during the evening and [into the] early morning hours prior to her deathn; and another decedent reportedly consumed a large quantity of cocaine while partying with his roommates. He was found dead the next morning. The coroner reports one was partying with his wife at a friend's home prior to his death, where they eventtlaliy went to bed. Apparently, \"at approximately 0620 [the next morning] their friend attended to the master bedroom to find both [the decedent] and [his wife] in bed unresponsive*. In one overdose situation the decedent did not appear to be partying. Rather, he \"spent the evening visiting and watching T.V\" with his girlfriend the evening of his death. His girlfriend told poke that she went shopping during the evening, and upon returning, discovered \"the bathroom door was locked and ... was unable to get any response from her calls\". It may be that the subject was attempting to conceal his heroin use from his girlfriend; however, it is difficult to be sure. She called 91 1 emergency workers who \"forced the bathroom door open and found [the decedent] slumped against the sink. He was transported to hospital but never regained consciousness. - --- ~----~.- ~ ~.. -. Figure 3: The Activities of the illicit Drug Overdose Subject Prior to Death Socializing With Others Events Unclear a A Period of Abstinence From Drug Use lilicit drug overdose subjects were also similar to alcohol overdose subjects in that in a significant number of cases (33%, n = 5) the police investigation was unable to establish the aMes of the decedent prior to their death. Again, in these cases it seems overdose subjects were either alone ai the time of their death (n = 31, or were \"street people\" (n = 2). Of those who were probably alone while mnsuming, coroners report that one saject \"was found lifeless, in a chair, at the kitchen tabfe in her rented suite, by a son\"; one was discovered \"lying face down on the bed in the room\" of a hotel; and one apparently lived and consumed tkir drugs alone. The coroner explains that the subject did not have a tetephone, but \"had an arrangement with his empioyer to be contacted through a neighbor who had a telephone\". After receiving a calf fmm the erriplc)'yei, the neighbr wee to the demdmt's house and dimered him \"lying face up in bed ... axered with a quilt?. After taking a closer look he discovered that \"foamy like material was extruding from his [friend's] mouth and nostrils\", and that he was obviously dead. Of those described as \"street peopte\", coroners report that one was found acoltapsed forward over an old chair cushion\" near the Georgia Viaduct in Vancouver; the other was discovered in a public parking lot- The coroner notes that a passing citizen \"discovered the dead body of a femaie lying immediately in front of dhis vehicle, up against a aid wailn in a public parking lot. The similarities kWem the afmhof and the itlicit drug overdose subjects are striking- The death of five subjects (23%) ffdlowed a period of abstinence or withdrawal from drug use, a conditbn that has ken reported by a number of drug researchers as a major contributing factor in the etiology of the heroin overdose (Krivanek, 1988)- Three decedents had recently ken correctianal fadtity, me from a \"Wfway housen, and one was incarcerated when his overchse occ=un&- f hree of these decedents were also described by coroners as depressed at the time of their deaths -- again, a frequent symptom associated both with iificit drug and atcohot abuse. The development of toftxance (the physiological adaption of the body to the effects of a drug) occurs after repeated exposure. Experienced heroin users an toterate very high doses of heroin, \"far beyond the lethal threshold for nowopiate users\" [Alexander. 1990: 164). The same can be said about experienced afmW users. Tolerance, however, decreases signifiantiy during periods of abstinence or witmrawal from drug use. Ingold (I 986) reparts tisat recent withdrawal from drug use as a result of treatment, imprisonment, as weli as self-imposed abstinence, is among the risk situations that may have mntribiited to deattr in as many as NO/b of overdoses he studied. It seems a similar number of overdose cases in this study may asso be explained, at teast in part, by a ldss of tolerance. Police irivestigaijng the overdose scene and pathdogists conducting the atumpsy provide information to the coroner concerning the mode of drug mnsumption. While afmhol is consumed orally, illicit drugs may be msMned in a mmbe of ways. These indude: safest because it requires ttre drug (tmaJty in capsule form) to become soluble in the stomach The i.~v node ~L:~ssumg&n,n is by far the most dangerous mode of &in&sr!r?j 1, &sr; sew= 33s-n is bypassed d delivered djret!y in:^ ;& biozweifm their effects are virtually jmmne~us Y&C iqeftlon [ RiGere, t 994).

The mode &q wert-j~se ~~2:e.s !s 5-5.8;- - @+we 4. Several studies have found that i-v. injection is the most common method of consuming heroin. in a study of heroin overdoses in Washington D.C., RtRtenber & Luke (15384) report that \"autopsy results indicate that decedents administered heroin afrnost exctusivefy intravenously\", white Ingold (1 986), in a study of iflicit drug overdose deaths in Paris, determined that 80% involved the i-v. mode of administration. According to autopsy evidence reviewed in this study, i.v. ingestion is ah the most common mode of hsroin consumption in B.C. in 80% jn = 12) of the illicit drug overdoses pathologists suggest the decedent consumed their drug intravenousiy. In %It but one of tbese cases pathologists discovered recent venipuncture sites on the body. in these cases the pathologist typicaliy mtes that \"derrnatologic assessment showed several recent needle tracksn, cw \"there were venipuncture sites in the left antecubital fmA of another area of the body. tn one case the pathologist reports that there \"were recent venipuncture sites in the right arm and on the right side of the neck in tihe region of the jit-gukir vein\". IR me case the coroner suggested Bat the decedent probabfy consumed the drugs intiavenousIy since a build up of foreign material was found in the decedent\" lungs. This material is a byproduct of the substances that are eombked with drugs, such as kroin, when they are sold iilicitfy, and is nut caused by the ingestion of the drug per se. Once adbed, they increase the wltpme (and therefore prMtSty) of these drugs. The mruner reports that mart: We route of admfi%s&&ii is rmmrortin the iungs, case police found \"a mirror on a counter downstairs with some white pder on it and a ro!M up piece of paper next to It\", suggesting that the decedent probabiy ansumed the heroin intranasally since paper cylinders are often used to draw the drug into the nasal cavity. The pathologist was unable to find needle marks on the decedent's body to indicate a history of i.v. drug abuse. In two cases the absence of syringes at the scene of the death, and a body free from needle marks, suggests that the drugs were consumed intrat-iasaffy or by smoking. Biomedical Context of the Overdose. Very few overdose subjects are free of disease states or medical problems; in fact, 87% (n = 12) of the alcohol overdose subjects, and 80% of the illicit drug overdose subjects, suffered from some kind of medical pathology prior to death- In terms of the alcohol overdoses, chronic alcohol abuse was responsibie for the largest portion (55%) of meaicai conditions diagnosed. Other medical pathologies associated with the alcohol overdoses were caused by the adulterants that iiiicit drugs are combined with (I 5 A), poor diet aWor a sedentary fifestyle (15%), and tobacco abuse (5%). 10% of the disease states associated with the alcohol overdose subjects were caused by amtact with a person with H.1-V. fi-e. sharing a needfe, a blood transfusion, sexual COlStact). 1 Figure 5: Origin of Medical Pathologies - The Alcohol Overdoses. 1 A1 coho! Abuse Poor Diet/Lifesty le fl Adultrants Contact with A Person with H.I.V. a Tobacco Abuse f n contrast, none of the disease states associated with the illicit drug overdose subjects were mused by the use of illicit drug per se; the largest portion (30%) were caused by the aduftmnts that drugs are combined with when sold illicitfy. Other medicai pathologies associated with illicit drug overdoses were mused by chronic afcohol abuse (20%), contact with a person infected with H-I-V. (20%) or hepatitis 3 (lO\"A)x poor diet andfcr a sedentary lifestyle (15%), and tobacco abuse (5%). The origin of the disease states associated with these overdoses are shown in figures 5 and 6- Figure 5: Origin 5-f Medical Patbolugies - The Illicit Ontg Overdose Subject. Adultrants Abuse contact With A Person With H.I.V. Pwr Dietllifestyle Contact With A Person With Hepatitis B Tobacco Abuse fher pathdogies caused by a!mbi abuse are common, both among alcohol and illicit drug users, and alcohol and illicit drug overdose subjects. In a study of Liver sections obtained from 273 drug abusers Kringhsholrn & Chrristoffersen (I 982) repor! that 65% showed some kind of inflammatory liver disease- Keul et al- (1 9931, in a study of 53 cases of drug-related deaths, found that 75% of the decedents suffered from liver disease. These pattrotqies were attributed to either atcottot abuse, the adutterants combined with illicit di~gs, or a virus feg hepatitis B). In my study, liver d-%ease - the must common medicaf condition diagnosed in the aimhd werdose subjects - was found by pathologists in 73% (n = I I) of these cases. it is micutt to determine the length of alcohol abuse based sotely on autopsy findings since the progression of these conditions is mediafed in large pxt by diet, and other lifestyle cho-ices. An atcubt abuser able to maintain a heatthy diet and stay active is less likely to see these medical pathologies deveiop into major health problems than one who Is not (Batch & Bafch, 1990). PattrOtogistsjo suggest, howem, tirat 5 were suffering hum the symptoms long fern alcOtx>t abuse (i-e. likely 10 years or more), a~d term medical cornplicitticms caused by alcohoi abuse diagnosed at autopsy include: \"alcoholic fiver disease with atcob1 abuse was atso detected in a significant number of itlicit drug overdase subjects (2774, n = 41, suggesting that more tfiafr onequarter af these decedents had a history of afcohof abuse.

Irn this study these adultera* caused organ damage in 400% jn = 6) of the ifkit dnrg overdose subjects, making then the most common Wfi these decedents, As .-- eMdent within the lung tissuen. In this case the coroner notes that these findings suggest the dececient \"was not a chronic and heavy 'chronic obstructive lung disease\", whife one iiiicit drug overdose subject was diagnosed with the \"bilateral centriiobuiar emphyseman- Both are caused by chronic tobacco abuse. Other disease states 6'@msed in decedents incfude H.I.V., detected in 13% (n = 2) of the aim-no! overdose subjects, and 27% (n = 4j of the iflicit drug overdose subjects. i-iepatitis 8 was diagnosed in 13% (n = 2) of the illicit drug overdose subjects, but none of the alcohol overdose subjects. These ~~ may be acquired through sexual contact, blood transfusions, or the use of mntaminated needtes. Many i-v. drug users are especiaffy at risk for acquiring these disease states ttecaitse they share their needles with other i.v. drug users when they are unable to source their own. These patnoiogies are pa&kuIarly significant in terns of the owait health of akahd and illiit drug abusers because they tend to weaken the body's response ta other infectious diseases, placing them at further risk of acquiring more infectious, and poterrtiafBy )r dictiseases. That is why infectious diseases, next to the effects of intoxication, pky a central role in lifethreatening complications for drug ams\" (Barn+-* 1993: 6%). damage. Based upon this evidence coroners indicated that most alcohol and illicit drug overdose subjects had an extensive histay of alcohol or illicit drug abuse: 93% fn = 14) of the alcohuf overdose subjects had a history of alcohol abuse, and 87% (n = 13) of the illicit drug overdose subjects had a history of illicit drug abuse. In addition, WXi of the alcohol overdose subjects (n = 6), and 47% (n = 7) of the itticit drug overdose subjects had a history of both alcohol and Micif drug abuse, suggesting that ptysubstance abuse is a problem for a signif-mnt number. This inference is supported by toxicoiogical data, reviewed in the second part of the chapter. in most alcohol overdose cases (n = JO) interviews with those who knew the dececlent helped to estzlziish that the decedent had a history of afcohol abuse. In these cases the coroner will typically note their \"investigation revealed that tk decedent had a history of abbf abusen, the decedent \"suffered from chronic alcoholism\", or the decedent had \"a wdf documented history of alcow ;tbt&\"' In me case, the coroner indicates that the decedent \"was a d-mrric aitxthofic with many admissions to hospital for alcohol intoxication\", whik in another friends of the decedent \"all agreed that he had been a pa~%mf&y heavy &inge drhker\". tfrrfortunatefy it is difficult to determine how Isng the demht was abusing abh~i or the degree of abuse; terms such dFiMef, as welt as phrases such as =a history of akdwl abuseu, may conjure up different images to dierent one persun\" s\"aicd.rdid\" may a separate index uf the overdose subjects' history of alcohol abuse in most (n = 8) of these cases. In five cases, or 33% of the sample, autopsy findings indicate that the decedent likely had a lung term history of chronic alcohol abuse. Organ damage was severe. Three of these decedents were diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, a condition that typically takes several years to develop. In the other, the coroner states: This was not a healthy woman. Her liver was significantly enlarged for her stature, weighing approximately twice that expected due to massive accumulation of fat within the liver cells. Superimposed on this more chronic process was an acute alcoholic hepatitis. In 3 cases, or 20\"b of the sample, autopsy evidence suggests shoe term alcohol abuse. In one case the pathologist found a \"mild hepatomegaly associated with miid macro vesicular hepatocellular steatosisn- In another, the pathologist indicates that the decedent had \"afcoholic liver disease\", describing the decedent's liver as \"enlarged [with] fatty metamorphosis of a type most frequently aSSOCiatd with alcohol abusen- The pathologist notes that another ciecedeM had an \"enlarged fatty liver -.. supporting his prior history of ahhot abuse\". 8 Figure 7: Alcohol Overdose Subjects' History of Alcohol Use. 1 h History of Alcohol Abuse No History of Alcohol Abuse In four cases coroners were unable to establish that decedents had a history of alcohol abuse from those who knew them; however autopsy evidence indicates that the decedent must have. The coroner explains that the decedent's liver was: significantly enlarged and showed severe fatty degeneration of a type vifiuafiy diagnostic of chronic alcohol abuse. There was also scarring of the pancreas, a condition also associated with chronic alcoholism. En two cases the coroner expiains that \"examination reveafed fatty degeneratim of the giver. chronic abuse\". This sugcpts that the cfeederrt's history of aicdtoi abuse was likety shwter then in cases described above with mote extensive organ damage (i.e. panmatitis, cirrhosis) was diagnosed. In another case the coroner found \"a moderate degree of fatty degeneration in the fiver frequently associated with chronic alcohol abuses put] there was no stigmata of alcoholism in the other organs\". While interviews with those who knew the decedent and autopsy evidence did not indicate that the one remaining decedent had a history of alcohol abuse, autopsy evidence suggests that he had a history of illicit i-v. drug abuse. The pathologist reports that foreign material was found in the lungs (\"Junkie Lung\"), a common sign of illicit i.v. drug abuse. A number of syringes were also discovered at the scene of the death. ffticit Dmgs and the fIIicit Drug Overdose Subject Coroners were able to establish that 87% (n = 13) of the illicit drug overdose subjects had a history of \"drug abuse\". It is not always dear, however, which drugs the decedents were using. Coroners typically describe decedents as \"having a longstanding history of chronic drug ... abuse\" or \"known to abuse drugsu, without describing the types of drugs they are referring to. Autopsy evidence indicates however that most decedents were i-v. drug users (n = 1 U), suggesting that most likely had a history af heroin abuse- The most common autopsy evidence indicating that the decedent was an i.v. dnrgs user is 'Junkie Lung\". Pathologists found organ damage caused by the substmces heroin is cosnbined with in 7 cases. The foilowing descxiption is The route of admirtistration is uncertain, but the lungs, liver and spleen on microscopic examination aft showed foreign body crystalline materia! consistent with chronic intravenous drug abuse.

In one heroin overdose the coroner makes this clear by rem-rrg that while none of the dntgs in the decedent's body were detected in excess crf the estabtished tethal level (including the heroin), \"their combined effect, particularly with respect to C.N.S. depression of respiration may have contributed to death\"- The Rule of CNS, Depressants Avaiiabfe by Prescription According ts a number of studies, prescription drugs that depress C.N.S. activity have became an increasingly significant factor in the etiology of the illkit drug death. tn a study conducted in Germany, using toxicological data from three cities (Redin, &emen, Hamburg), Schmotdt et a!..

Figure 9 1 m Alcohol Only 65% illicitly, and are sometimes used to refieve the anxiety that often accompanies the heavy use sf ampktamines or cocaine . While these drgs rarely cause negative side effects or overdoses when consumed alone, chronic use of benzodiazepines in combination with other drugs <an produce severe problems, as well as fatal overdoses (Baselt, 1983; Chilnick, 1991). Combining valium and alcohol is especially dangerous because alcohol potentiates valium's depressant effects (Julien, 1 992)- Overall, Valium was detected in a signlficmt percentage of heroin overd~s (I@%, n = 1061, but very few alcohol overdoses (574, n = 20). Codeine The second most common prescription C.N.S. depressant invoived in the heroin overdose was axkine, detected in I1 % (n = 70 ) of these decedents. Other drugs invoked in the alcohol overdose were invotved in less then 5% of the cases, and are n=;t Mud4 in this iif7;it-ysis. The most common C.M.S. depressant involved in the heroin overdose was afcohuf, detected in 54% af tlciese r;sises. These toxicology findings are similar to ones reported by several drug imestigators, both in North America and Europe. Puschei (1993) reports that abut 40% of the heroin overdose decedents k positive for (1988: f47), in a shrdgr of drug overdoses that occurred in Denmark, -qmrts that \"akotrd was found in approximately 50% of the cases eacb year\"; and Year Figure f 1 Compared to ail the other drugs associated with the heroin overdose, a;[cobi's presence has aiso Imeased tk most Ween f 384 and 1993 (see The Heroin Overdose The average blood m orphine concentration (the me Ftabolite of heroin measured by toxidogisis) detected h tRe heroin overdose subjects was -35 mitfig~ams per litre zrf (range 0.0 to 3.70 rn-g.). This average is seven times the minimum established fethai level (.05 milligrams). Use of the average morphine comrrtratiott is deceiving, however, since a small number ot extreme so~res (n = 26, or about 4% of the sample) showed extremely high morphine conmntraiions, ranging from 1.00 to 9.12 ts-tood morphine curcentratson was -25 milligrams. experienced heroin users (which, according to the findings d this study, make up the bulk of heroin overdose subjects) can tolerate concentrations in excess of this Iwel. For example, Baseit et a. (I 975) found postmortem morphine concentrations as high as -30 milligrams in subjects dying from causes other ban an overdose. They suggest that this level is likely not lethal for heroin users who have developed tolerance as a result of repeated exposure to the drug. Since the majam (70\"?, n = 461) had a morphine concentralions less then or equal to -30 milligrams, it is likely that factors in addition to the drug, such as the interactson af other drugs and existing medical conditions, were afso cxlntribuking facWs in may d these 8att;s. ?Pis issues are ~~ploi~d further in the Conduding Chapter (Ghitpter four). The average Mood akohol concentration detected in the heroin overdose subjects was -14 milligrams per liter of blood (range -01 - .53%). These findings are significant in terms uf etiology muse alcohol levels of -10% or higher have been found to be major contributing factors in the heroin overdose (LeYine et al., 1995; Ruttenber & Luke, 1984; Ruttenter et al., 1991). Figure 13 s the percentage of heroin overdoses with -10% alcohol or higher in the at death. AJmhMs role in the heroin overdose is also explored further i-n the CondMing Chapts- The minimum letha! fewel for intravenously is t .O rnil.ligrcarns: consumed zraliy lgit is 1 f -90 milltgrms prrtbtem coroners ir: generdty assume that the cacaine was cortstrmed inQavenotssty in cases where scene circumstances s the decedent was an rntravenous heroh user. ft is nct a'ways possible however to rule out other forms of administration such as insufflation (snorting). For example, it is possible that the subject consumed the heroin intravewusiy, and the octcaine by snorting. The average cocaine mncentration detected in the blood of heroin overdose subjects was 2.66 rnitiigrams (range -03 - 67.84 rn-g.). These figures, however, include the concentration of benzoytecogonine, cocaine's rnetabf&e, since toxbiogists normally add these together to estimate the amount of cocaine mnsumed prior to death. Since ttenzuyieoogonine levels remain in the blood for longer periods than cocaine, it Is not atways possible & distinguish past m~ne we from current use (Woq & Alexander, I991 ). Mrtieover, since L>enzo$ecogonine is an inactive metabolite, it would not have contributed to death (Wong & Alexander, 1991 j.

Other drugs involved in the alcohol overdoses were detected in less than 6% of the cases. CHAPTER FOUR: CONCLUSIONS Recap The goal of this study was to present a comprehensive portrait of the nature and causes of overdoses attributed to both alcohol and heroin. My findings may surprise some. Contrary to public opinion, and based upon reports mmpteted by the coroner and the toxicdogist, alcohol can be just as toxic as heroin. And in situations where these drugs are being used euinputsivefy or in an abusive fiishii3n - as in the case sf the \"alcohoiic\" or ine \"heroin junkie\" -- heroin is considerably less toxic than alcuhol. Despite the rnyttmlogy that surrounds heroin and the stereotype of the \"heroin junkien, heroin does not cause permanent physiologhl damage to the body. Thus, as Boyd (1993: 21C) argues, \"[tlhere is ar: irony in our policies of control: we place costly criminal prohibitions on drugs that are less dangerous to us and we permit the promotion of drugs that are killing us\". As indicated in the Introductory chapter, support for the crininalization of heroin was gained after errorreous conclusions were reached about the pkmawfqicat quaiitities of ihe opiates at the beginning of the century. Prior, the opiates were regarded as medical panaceas, as 'Gods own medicine\". However, tn a period characterized by a major moral reform movement, efxzmmic insecurities, and racial tensim, a rnyth;>iogy about these drugs emerged. The \"dm fiend mentafit)f\", white based upon misinformation, . -me in a am and a psesuiar justification wafking into \"death on the inmilment plan? These mnciusions (like those reached at the turn of the century) were fwmed, Pmwr, thrqh a process of miattribution. Today many heroin users suffer from social, economic, medical, and legal problems; however none of these zwditions can be fairly described as resuiting from heroin &use ;ler se- Most people now acknowledge that anempts to repress the use of alcohol through cviminiiiizslIion faiid. Prohibition pushed ihe manufacture a~rd distribution of almbi undefgroiind: and criminal manufacturers combined \"moonshinen alcohol V&@I a stew of toxic substances (e-g. pyridine, hnzine, nicotine, mercury) in order to increase its volume and profitability (Mitchell, 1991). This made it an extremeiy dangerous drug, and as a result, thousands were blinded, paralyzed, and killed after consuming it (Nadelmann, 1993: 42). Prohibition made. alcohol extremely dangerous; the War on Drugs has done the same to heroin- Attempting to prohibit the use of heroin through criminal sanctions has kd several negative consequences. These include: (I) making heroin more toxic and less pure; (2) enmuraging more dangerous modes of drug administration; (3) increasing criminal activity; (4) fostering more dangerous potydnrg habits; and (5) making users feel deviant, sick, or just plain bad. Criminatiziltlg the drug also diverts attention from the full range of causes of these probiems. Tkse issues are explored in this chapter. The fanous Swiss physician Paracetsus argued that \"ail substances are pisons; there is none which is not a poison. The right dsse differentiates a pison from a remedy\" (Cired by Eckert, 1980: 79). In the 19th century heroin was a remedy; today it! is a poison. Prior to criminalizsttion heroin was used to treat people; today if kills them. The difference is prior to ctiminalization the purity of the drug was mnlrdfed by tegai businesses and physicians. Today the drug's purity is mmafteb by criminal syndicates, whose goal is profit, not the weft-being of users.. Users today have no reliable way of determining the OEise they are wmmirig. Cmsq;rently -- and not sarprisIng!y -- overdoses are mrnon. As Nadelmann (I 989: 942) diagnosing the problem is rektivefy straig htfoward: \"nothing resem bf ing an underground Food and Drug Administration has arisen to impose quality controf on the illegal drug market\". tn the context of the current War on Drugs a heroin user in Vancouver might '\"hoot upm with 9% heroin today, and 90% heroin tomorrow -- depending upon their source, and the vagaries of the illicit market. The consequences are frequently fatal. imagine not king ate to determine if the beer you were drinking mntained s0/6 or Wk atwhot; if the wine you enjoy with your dinner contained 7% or 7096 akmbf; or if the pain reliever you took for a headache mntained 9 or 900 grains of aspirin - and what the consequences migM be if you were using these drugs. Less than ten years ago heroin users in Vancouver were seldom able to Not onry do heroin users risk consuming a product of unknown purity, they hawe no way ot detmining what substances their drug has been mixed with to Increase its vulrrme and prditabilrty. In the 19th century opiates were combined w-&h benign ingredients, such as molasses artd sassafras. Today, however, a user might inject heroin combined with acetaminophen and caffeine one week, antipyrine and knocaine the next, and lactose and procajne tfie week after.. it is implant to realize that these adulterants - not heroin - were responsibie fur the mast common disease state associated with the heroin overdose subjectss \"Junkie Lung? A p9iq drug periobimlty unavaiiable or prohiwefy expensive, also seems to have entrenched the most dangerous mode of administering opiate drugs. When heroin is diflicuit to obtain, or expensk, users have been known to rely upon the most economical method oi consuming it: the use of the hypodermic syringe. fhe needle has become the most common method ai' consuming the drug. Alexander (1 990: 1 47) repats that after erRmcement efforts by the US. army reduced the supply of heroin in Vietnam, soldiers began turning to the needle. Refusi'ag to fund needle exchange programs has also increased the dangers associated with using heroin by encouraging users to share their needles with &hers.. This puts them at a substantial risk for acquiring several viruses, irrctudirrg Hepatitis B. and H- I-V-, the vim believed to cause A. 1. D.S. ti. I. V. was diagnosed in 27% af tire illicit drug overdose subjects. According to Dr. Mimet Rekart (BC-'s Directw of Sexually Transmitted Disease Control) H.I.V. infedions have increased in the protrim mostly because users are sharing contaminated needles (Wigwmb, 1995). Similar conclusions have been reached by Liz Whynot, medical health officer for the Downtown Eastside of Vmuver (Woad, f 9%). The percentage of seropositive tests in 8.C. from i-v. drug users inaeased from f percent in 1988, to approximate& 5% in 1994, and is stil rising (fWEinsot7 & Hawthome, 1996: 25). There is some good news, however- While the number of H.I.V. cases assodated with i.v. drug users is increasing in Vancouver, according to the FSeprf of &e Task Fmce Into IIkB Narcotic Deaths [British Columbia, 1994) needie exchange programs- such as the one operated by the Downtown EasBide Youth Activities Society (D.E.Y.A.S. ), have helped to keep Vartcouver's rate of H-P.V. infectton (among i.v. drug users) the lowest of any major city in Canada- Given that Vancouver has the largest concentration of I.v. heroin users in Ganadal7, this is remarkable. In a politicat environment wkre virtually ail spending has come under attpck, programs such as these contlnue to face operating chaiienges. This is unfortunate since the scientific evidence is very clear abut needle exchange programs: they reduce the spread of the H.I.V. virus, and often accelerate entry into drug treatment proyams (Heher, 19SSj. Moreover, ebticating i.v. drug users about safe needie practices, and dispensing clean needles has helped to reduce the spread of H.I.V. in several countries in Europe (Byers, repmls that the recruitment of i.v. drug users to help reach out to hard-to-get users has been very successful; and the needle exchange program in Merseyside, England, has been credited with helping to keep that crty's rate of HAV. the second lowest of all regions in England18 (Mattinson & Hitwlhorne, 1996).

The rmaications of the first &hiation are ~raighffoward: it irnpdnts a wider criminal Wn@y among those who -- were it not for their use of heroin - woufd have remained nm-airninals. The rarnifkations of #e second situation may be worse: it increases the likelihood that a user will participate in other airninal activity beyond the purchasing of iiiegai drugs. for, while siud:es indicate that many ,hxoin aMlcts were invoPb In criminai activity prior ts their heroin use, in most cases the criminal activity escalates once the user has been forced to regularly rely rtpn a criminal subculture to obtain tkir drugs (Beime & Messersct-imi&, 1991 ; Giffen et ai., 1991 ; McGiothlin et at., f 978). Vancouver police report that abut 60 percent of all non drug crimes (e.9. B & E's, car break-ins, armed robberies) are related to the purchase of illicit drugs (8ri-tish Columbia, 1994). The criminal nature of the drug underworld also puts drug users at a higher risk of being victimized than me average citizen (Faftah i mi 277 Despke these negative consequences, we rely upon tire criminal law to deai with heroin users. In 1994, while the overall crime rate was down, the number of drug incidents recorded by police increased (Canadian Crime Statistics, 1994). Pdice also report that investigations 05 heroin dealers have more than tripled in the fast severai years (R.C.MJ?, 19%). Law enforcement attempts to e!!mS.mte have !=lrgd)t unsuccessfu!: d,eIW.be Mike Carr, kart of the Vancower Police drug squad, reports that \"heroin is nearly out of control in this city\" (O'Brien, 1994: 38)- Tbe R.C.M.P. (I 993) report that ds#e intemtZonai interdiction attempts, worldwide opium After severat months of investigathg heroin overdose problem in BC., the Chief Coroner concluded that the \"so-called 'War on Drugs' ... can only be regarded as an expensive failure\" (Bri5si.l Columbia, 1994: vi). Police, while traditionally reluctant to question the status quo, have also began wondering \\~lbt-irer criminalizaBart is atPe most effective policy to deal with heroin. The Chief Coroner repats that potice told him they are \"wasting their time on this social issue\" (British Cotumbia, 1994: vi). Similar conclusions have been reached by senior poiice administrators in the US. as welt (International Antivohibitionist Leap, 1994). Today Vancower is Wieveb to be the largest supplier of itlegal heroin in Norfh America (OYBri-ien, 1994); and according to treatment professionals I spoke with, Pemh is easier to in Vamnder than msiiiuma 'J (Garrison, 1935). While tesearching a story on the \"war on drugs\" for The Georgia a writer Daniei &YOOif mtes that he learned ifom heroin users that heroin could be obtained \"faster than a Domino's pizza\" in the city (Wood, 1995: 13). The first time f realized how easy it was to obtain heroin in the city was, ironically, on the way to a hear Ethan Nadelrnann, a Princeton University professor, Wk about the failure of the American War on Drugs. Whik walking dm Msfjngs street on the way to the Harttour Centre campus of Simon Fraser University I was approached by an eager Wer and offered heroin. Other dqs seem just as easy to obtain: f also passed several young men whispering *upm and \"down\" -- street jargon for stimulants and Dangerous drug usi~ s2yies, including mixing heroin with cocaine into a \"qeedfeait\" comMnariion, using kmin in combination with alcohol (or any nmkr of otki dnxgs) may aiso be more likely in the context of the war on cri.mirraiization as it has become since. Previously, heroin users shunned alcohol and other drugs - most seemed to have been aware of the hazards from those who work with alcohol and illicit drug users in Vancouver (NloGuire, 1995; Townsby, 1995). This consumption pattern, however, started changing in the late 1%-Oss, when law enforcement measures designed to cBecrease the suppigr of heroin began escalating (Ruttenber et al., 1990). In the 1950's writer and koin user William Burroughs desxibed it this way: As t began using sluff everyday, or often several times a days I stupped drinking .._ When you use junk you don't drink. .. The liquor stays in the stomach, slowly building up nausea, dismrnfort, and dizziness and there is no k-kk. (Burroughs, 1953: 41). it seem that when f-terin is rr~ii~iiabie (or unaffordable) as a resuit of periodic enfccemes sum, however, seriously addicted users seek out drugs 81% are available (Ruttmkr et al., 1W]. Alcohol, prescription drugs, over- tbmmter drugs, ~f othx ill- drugs, are used to gain the effects desired. Red that 92% of the tieruin overdose subjects had mure than one drug in their blood at death; and that in total, 49 different dqs were detected in the &sect upon coroner's data revieweb in this study, it also seems that a signlficartt number af iflicit drug overdose subjects were former or current afcohof abusers. This conciusion was reached by the Chief Coroner in the Repon UP the Task Foi'a3 info ilkit Narcotic Qierdcise Death (British Cofumbia, 1994), and by researchers studying recent increases in itticit rrarook deaths in Gmmy (Shut&-Shaeffer, 1993). The irony is that chronic akohol abusers would be considerably better off consuming heroin then alcohol, had the drug been available to them in pure form and in knowable doses. Previously the opiates were used to treat alcohol addiction, apparently with some success (Rrecher, 1972)- Long term habitual use of heroin, as indicated, dcres not cause any physiological damage- Heroin or morphine may also be preferable bemuse, as a physician reported in an article entitled '\"Advantages of Substituting the Morphia Habit for the lncurabiy in in piace of exciting the baser passions, and hence is less productive of acts of violence and crime\" (Cited by Brecher, 1972: 8). Alcohol, a known precipitator of viokm (Fattah, 199f), is associated with about half of all homicides that cccur annualty in Canada (Boyd et al., 1991) and the US. f Mdefmann, 1989)- 0n.g 2;0x&1~ 63f3 analyzed in alcohol abusers are incr-irtak ex turnifla CI to heroin. perhaps because availability has helped to drive tite price dm- A .mint of heroin (about one-tenth of a gram) can be obtained for ZO ddiars in Vmcower, making it a relatively inexpensive habit. Yerain is atso easily obtained in Vancouver at most of the hotels in the Downtown Eastside of the city (Garrison, 1995). In 1984 less than a quarter of the heroin overdose subjects tested positive for alcohof; however by 1993 more than half did Postmortem blood alcohol concentrations in the decedents have also risen dramaticaliy. In 1984 8% of the heroin overdose subjects had blood alcabf concentrations of -10% or greater; by 1993 more than five times as many decedents (43%) had alcohol concentrations this high. Moreover, while none had alcohol concentrations of -25% or higher between 1984 and 1987 between 4 and 9 percent of the decedents had &coho! concentrations this high or higher after 1988. There are &her It.-i5efwms tit can be made from the inncreased presence of afcohof in the heroin ovefdme deaths. Ruttenber & Luke (1984: 17) argue that the rise in blood aimhol concentrations in heroin overdose subjects they studied in Washington D.C. were likely caused by \"an increase in ethanol msmption by heroin users, or an increase in heroin consumption by ethanol abusers, or by a mnbinatbn of these inffuent-esn. The rise of atcohol detected in heroin mwdaes subjects studied in Nwway fed Teige & Wethe (1 993: 952) to spwtate, the patternn occuned mq heroin users as wdi. These toxicobgy findings are also signsicant in term of explaining the etiology frrund to be major mntribksflng factors in several studies of illicit drug overdoses (Levine aE-@ 1995; Ruttenkr 8( Luke, a!. f 990). En some cases wruners have determined that this ievel was probably ~espof?sibfe for death sin= drug tevels decline after death19 (Garriott & Stuiner, 1973). One coroner explains that alcohol [found in the ptmwtem mp!e] wM ex&ap&d to a period of time prior to death would averdose subject hiad a Mmd alcohol concentration of -1 4%, it seems likely -- in- probable -- that in a substantial number of these overdoses the heroin may mt have been the primary cause of these deaths. When I contacted a couple of treatment centres in Vancouver and mentioned that the rote of alcohot in the kruin overdose bad risen dramatically since 1984, staff were not surprised. i was told that the habit of m-injesting heroin and almhof is imvitablie in ii-te Dowrtiom East Sick 13 'v'ancotriier. This area contains about 80 percent of all the licensed drinking seats in the city, or abux 7,300 Iicensed drinking seats (British Coiumbia, 1994: 4-61. Some hotels in the Downtown Eastside offer beer on \"Welfars Wednesday\" for andfound wnsider&Ce differencesences We comparisons were made between the same sites, cocaine lev& increased by as much as 1 TEF%l while leveis of benzoylecclgonine increased by as much as f 25%- 94 Drug foximw data afso indicate that increasing numbers of heroin overdose subjects were consuming cocaine prior to their beatha In 1984 about 8% of hemin ovwdose subjects tested podtke for cocaine, while by 1993 42% did, an increase of more than 500 percent In 1992 more Wan half of all heroin overdose subjects had mine in their blood at death. Availability may have erimu~qed heroin abusers to try cocaine. Anecdotal evidence reported by the Chief Coroner seems to support this conclusion- He reports evidence \"frequently suggests that .,. users may have been mine abusers who by acci;feP;P or iMmt purchased heroin and suSsquenliy succumbed to an inad-rertent heroin cw mixed drug uwerbose\" (British Cdurnbia, 1994: 2). Most of the problems associated witti cocaine -- like most drugs -- result from chronic and excessive exposure, when it has been combined with another drug, or when it is consumed intravenously (Chilnick, 1990; Erickson et al., 1994; Julien, 1992)- Ttze C.N.S. stimulation that cocaine causes can cause cardiac arrhythmias and seizures when consumed at high enough doses. This stimuiation is followed by C.MS depression. As a result, when cocaine is involved witfr a C.MS depressant (e.g. atcohot, heroin, valium, codeine) death may be rehted to the adwerse effects this stimulation causes to the heart muscle, as wefi as the combined effects of the respiratory depression that fdiows, or both (Baseit et ai., 1983; Escobedo et at., 1 992; Finkle & McCkxkey, 1977). VVhSife cocaine has been linked to fiver and lung disease states, many users abuse tobacco and alcohol (Alexander, 1990; Hartman, 1988), making it extreme& difficult to determine what role the Determining the precise rote cocaine played in these overdoses is also complicated by a routine procedure carried out by toxicotogists: adding together cocaine and -rts metabolite benzoytecogonine when estimating the on in in My a d Vdhiie this is a m~iim p:md~ie, it introduces a potentiaf error into the toxicotugicat analysis because benzoylecogonine remains in the blood for a longer period of time then coc&e. As a result, there is a chance that in some cases benzoyiecogonine cmcentmtions found in ifre bid at death represent an accumulated residual of many previous doses (Wong & Alexander, 1999: 11 1). Since berrzoyfqonine is an inactive compound these residual concentrations & mf have mwed t~ death. Researci'iers in 1981) the Wrt of combining iiixfriie drugs with iifegaf drugs is among the most significant fact- in the tS \u20ache overdose death. Most aiso lnd'rcate mat pryEm*m are imeasirrg. particularly for those believed to be suffering from some sort of inherent weakness or genetic (predisposing) pathology. Several years ago the LeDain Commission (I 973: 307) tried to debunk this myth, reporting that after extensive research on heroin it was determined that: The once popular notion that morphine-like effects are intrinsically so pleasurable that most users who experience them are prornptty addicted has not been scientifiealiy documented. The Adiptive Nlodef of Addidion (P,!exander, 1988; Alexander, 1990) seems to offer a more plausible explanation for drug addiction, accounting for the dynamic interaction of the role of the drug, the psychologica\\ stat2 of the user, and the social circumstances of use. The model suggests that most people become seriously addicted to drugs (whether legai or illegal) because their pharmacofogicai qualities are adaptive to a particular set of problematic individual and social circumstances, not because users have anything inherently \"wrongn with them. One former user highlights this, explaining that: \"'Wiiit heroin, your iik an be From this perspective most habitual heroin (or aicohoi or cocaine or prescription drug or over-the-counter) users are neither necessarily \"bad\", nor are they suffering from some kind of inherent psycf3ofqical problem- Rather, the decision to use a drug habitually seems to distract from a crippling preoccupation with a sense of fndividual failure, and often a dire social situation (AlemWr, 1990; Weis et ai., 1 992). While it is often difficult to determine the precise individual and social circumstances of ahhof and illicit drug overdose subjects based soley upon coroner's reports, it seems these individuals have a lot in common. Poverty, depression, toneliness, and homelessness, are among the most significant factors associated with both aicuhoi and illicit drug overdoses. Most lived in economic deprivation - in short, a ghetto; severaf were \"street peoplen -- and ccsmpteteiy hornetess. Unstable living conditions, and poverty, are very common findings among iliicit drug overdose subjects. So is a sense of worthlessness. The Chief Coroner, in the Report of the Task Force into lllicit Narcotic Overdose Deaths in Bn'tish Cohmbia explains that: AL - tire common ib~d Pat appeared to be present In each addict was his or her sense of worthlessness. Not one had any self esteem. Tky indicated they had been told consistently that they were \"low -lifey', for want of translation, tr thing more than a piece of \"feces\", and that they would never amount to anything in life. Psychologically they were nst o~fy damaged and defeated; they were destroyed. They felt subhuman, bereft of conscience and reason (British Columbia, 1994: 2). Based upon the findings of Report of the Task Force into lllicit Narcotic Overdose Deaths in Brifish Columbia, ttre number of overdoses in B.C. peak each month on the day foilowing \"Wetfare Wednesday\". This is the day income assistance cheques from the Ministry of Social Services are dis&ibied. This further highlights the inescapable: most overdose subjects are poor. it seems fairly clear that there are a number of individual, social, and ecomrnic challenges facing many users, and that the compulsive use of hemin for &cobf) provides relief from them, at least in the sitori term. One user highlights this, explaining that \"[ajfter shooting up, i muid live under the Hastings Strbt viaduct and actually believe 1 was living in a castle\" (Cited by British Columbia, 1994: 40). When a drug has been found to be \"adaptive, functional, or ego-syntorric\" to a user's current individual and social circumstances, it is much more likely to lead to compuisive use (Chein et al., 1934: 227; Parker et a!., 1988; Puschel et at., 1993). This suggests that under certain mndiions virtually anyone can develop a drug addiction. Physician and dmg ieseirckr Andrew Weil (1994) explains it this way: the essence of addiction is craving for an experience or object to make yourself feel all right. It's the craving for something ott.ter than self, even if that's wjibin the iedm ff the mind. i atso feet that addiction is something that's fuWrnentally human; it affects everybody (Weii, 1994: 34). Highlighting the drugs associated with these overdoses is one way of attempting to understand these deaths. It is also corxenient. It offers an easy scapegoat for a constellation of individual and social problems for which no uther single cause can be found. But it doesn't really help us understand these deaths in any meaningful way, since the majorrty of alcohol and heroin users do not face the indlviauai and social probieims people ovsrdosifig on these drugs do (Mitchell, 19% ; Trebach, 1993). Moderate heroin (and afmhol) use is typicafty associated with considerably less individual and social stress. Erickson (1 995) reports for example that cocaine use by \"well integrated individuafs ... is usually well controlled and poses few problems\". This means that, as Weil (1983) notes, \"Any drug can be used successfully, no matter bow bad its reputation, and any drug can be abused, no matter how in 'die$ram, for eirripie, many soldiers kame addicted to heroin; its' pain soldiers experiencing the stress, anxiety, and depression often associated with combat. ft is significant to note, however, that after returning to the US. most Vietnam veterans gave up their heroin habits, even though drug availability was not a prmlem (Zinberg, 1984). It seems that after returning to kiends and family, more s8qportive social circumstances, and a less stressful supported by animal researchm- Compulsive heroin use seems to arise in situations where users are suffering from both individual and social problems for which the drug provides some relief. Directing our attention at the psychofogical state of the use and the sociai circumstances of use, rather then simply the drug, seems to offer the most hope far understanding drug add'lctions. Chornsky (1 991 ) suggests, however, that: if ordinary pqle are free to reflect on the causes of human misery ... they may well draw all the wrong conclusions. Therefore they must be inJoctrinated or diverted, a task that requires unremitting efforts. The means are many; and engendering fear of a threatening enemy has always been a powerful toof in the kit (Chomqky, 1991 : 109). Chomsky's insights can be easity applied to the heroin problem we face today: since the opiate drugs were crirninalized we have been indoctrinated with the befief that heroin is the prototypical dangerous drug; it has become the 20 Alexander (3990) reportsthat rats housed in small barren cages &-administered sixteen f mes mo~e morptsine than #ase bused with &ers of both sexes in a \"roomy and comfartabfeP environment These findings further emphasize the crucial role the psychological SaEe af fk userz and tire sacid cinxrrnshms of tarsumption, play in compulsive drug use. I01 been fostered, in part, by semtionafist media depictions of heroin users. By hIghfQhtiw the most -sm&iiy and wrromi~ily depressed people as heroin users, the media inadvertently promote several erroneous beliefs about the pharmilcological qualities of heroin. Those with no experience with the drug are led to believe that heroin causes these problems- It does not; no drug is that powerful. Despite the stereotypes and the mythology surrounding heroin, there are many examples in the literatuie of heroin users, leading long, productive, and healthy lives in spite of their addiction. A study of 861 heroin addicts in Philadelphia -- some of whom had been addicted for as long as 20 years -- determined that \"addiction is not characterized by physical deterioration or impairment of physical fitness\". According to the physicians conducting the study, there was \"no evidence of changes in the circuiatoty, hepatic, renal, or endocrine functions\" (Cited by Brecher, 1972: 23). These heroin users were aware of the doses they were consirming, constimed tPem free from adufterants, and maintained a healthy diet. Heroin, consumed in these conditions, is a iernarkabiy safe drug. After years of research, many recognized experts have come to this condusion. Physician Raymond Ho~cle, of the Stuan-Kettering Cancer tenter, explains: \"if heroin were not banned I wuuM probably use it tooa (Cited by Tretrach, 1987: 295). Despite its illegality, recognized experts still, consider heroin to be \"the standard against which new amkpsks are rnmwr& {Jaffe & Martin, 1980: 4952- Criminalization Diverts Attention From the Full Range of Causes of Problems. The most visible heroin users suffer from a tremendous amount of social and medical pathdogy. Based upon the findings of this study, however, few of tkse problems can be fairly attributeci to heroin use per se. While autopsy data indicates existing disease states were diagnosed in 80% of the illicit drug overdose subjects, it seems these medical pathologies were caused by everything but heroin- They were caused by: (1) a poor diet and/or a sedentary lifestyle; (2) contact with a person infected with a virus; (3) other drug taking behavior; or (4) conditions created by the \"war on drugs\". Unfortunateiy a poticy of crirninalization, by suggesting that the drug is the problem, has hefped divert attention from the the actual causes of these medical pathologies. ft is significant to note that virtually all of the disease st2tef associated with the Ifficit drug overdm s::b@c& - none of which were caused by any of the itlicit drugs - can elevate the chances a fatal drug intoxication will occur. These disease states atso help to explain why most afoohol overdose subjects (87%) and heroin overdose subjects $7076) had postmortem drug concentrations that were either: (If blow the minimum established lethal tevet, or (2) were similar to concsentrations detected in subjects dying from causes other than an overdose. It seems that, as Starkenstein (1979) wS=s its qual-w or quantir)r, can be caiied a total poison, for its toxic action wiff always depend on the condiions irr&ic which it acts rrpan the organism\" (cited in Filov, 1979: 15). The condins under which heroin is being constimed in B.C. are explored in the following section. One in five illicit drug overdose subjects (20%) suffer from disease states mused by a poor diet or a sedentary Iifesfyie (i-e. atheroscterosis, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease). All of these medicat conditions can elevate the chances a user will suffer an overdose. Stanski et al., (1978) determined that subjects suffering from cardiovascular disease states (i.e. rate of metabulization the longer the drug remains phamacotogicaity active in the system, and, consequently, the greater the opportunity for a toxic reaction to occur. Cardiovascuiar pathologies can also increase the odds a toxic or fatal reaction will occur by straning respiratory activity (Berkowitz et al. 1975; Jaffe & Martin, 1985). In one overdose situation the coroner makes this clear, repoffing that \"the enlargement of the heart associated with [the decedent's] raised blood pressure would have contributed to ... death by putting an added strain on the heart\". Disease states caused by the \"war on drugs\" or (eg. itlicit drug overdose subjects, can also 23 d af- (1 97%) repoit that stbjects sufferfng frm cardiovascular disease states had an average motphine half-Me of 4.5 hours, white non - diseased subjects had an average half-rife of 295 hours- 104 Increase the odds that an overdose will occur by burdening respiratory functioning. in some cases lung pathologies are so extensive that they can muse death even in a Soby free from drugs. In a study of overdose victims in France, fngofd (1986: 88) reports that in many overdose situations \"it is likely that ... acute intoxication js nut the sole or principle cause of death ... since the impaired general condiiion and lesions (for example, those affeaing the liver and lungs) play such an important role that they alone may be the cause of death\". Contact Witf7 A Person Infected With A Comrnunicab~e Virus Disease states arising from contact with a person infected with a communicabIe virus (e-g- H.f.V., Hepatitis B), detected in 30% of the illicit drug overdose subjects, can play a major role in increasing the chances a fatal drug intoxication will occur. This is because these conditions tend to weaken the body's immune system, placing the user at risk for acquiring a host of medical problems that may interfere with circulation, respiration, or digestion. Since in many cases these disease states are acquired when needles are shared with an Infected person, they could also be attributed to the war on drugs; advocates of criminaiization have traditionally been against dispensing needles to heroin users. The fear has been that dispensing needles will enmurage intravenous drug use; however, \"there is no evidence in the literature, or from experience in the field, that the introduction of needle exchange programs has led to an increase in drug usen (British Columbia, 1994: 18). On the contrary, evidence from the field suggests that contact with reeedle exchange programs is often the first step a user will make towards getting treatment (Mattinson & Hawthorne, 1996). Disease states caused by chronic alcohol abuse (e-g. cirrhosis, pancreatitis, hemorrhagic gastritis, alcoholic hepatitis), diagnosed in almost a third (27%) of all iiiicit drug overdose subjects, can also profoundly alter the toxicity of a drug, and increase the odds that an overdose will occur (Clark, 1988). This is because these conditions tend to reduce the rate at which enzymes in the body convert drugs into their less dangerous metabulites. A heafthy liver plays a pivotal role in sheltering users from the most be!eterious effects of drugs (tieber, 1983). Moreover, extensive liver damage may cause death even in a body free from drugs. The Canadian Centre For Substance Abuse (1994) reports that cirrhosis (and other conditions caused by long term alcohol abuse) accounted for 2,155 deaths in Canada in 1990. This type of organ damage was diagnosed in about one-fiih of the illicit drug overdose subjects. Given that chronic tobarn abuse is often found among alcohol and illicit drug abusers, it is somewhat surprising that conditions that result from this consumption pattern (e-g. Ittng disease, emphysema) were detected in only 5% of the illicit drug overdose subjects. Nonetheless, these conditions can contribute to an overdose death in much the same way \"junkie lung\" can, by burdening respiration. Medical complications associated with illicit drug overdoses, coupled with plysubstance abuse, and the fact most decedents had drug levels lower then those found in subjects dying from causes other than an overdose, suggests that the drugs involved in these deaths were probably not sufficient atone to cause many =f these deaths. Since several other factors are akm invufved in these deaths, some have argued that applying the label \"overdose\" to deaths involving heroin is actually a convenience more than anything else (Brecher, 1972: 106). Similar concfusions have been reached by researchers studying other kinds af drug death, including those attributed to methadone and cocaine. tn a study of overdose deaths attributed to methadone, Alexander et al. (1988) determined that almost half of the decedents had postmortem methadone concentrations bebw the established lethal level. They report that their anafysis of the coroners reporis, coupled with inquiries made with those who knew the decedents, helped them determine that the actual cause of death in most cases was not methadone, but the \"prolonged general deteriorationn -- physicaHy and rnenWly -- of the users (Alexander et al., 1988: 161). It seems for many the methadone was the \"finai pharmacoiogicai insuit that pushed some of these deteriorated people over the brink\" (Alexander et ai., 1988: f 61). The methadone overdose subjects studied by Alexander et al., (1 988) -- like the illicit drug overdose subjects analyzed in this study - typically had an extensive history of altmhot abuse that mntributed to their deaths. Similar mndusiom were reached by Wong & Alexander (1991) in a study of ~veibse deaths amibtif,ed t! cocaine. They 5wdp39d fag-time intravenous m] more productively ... attributed to accumulated iil health, to the conditions &at instigated their deviance, or to the current drug laws (Wong & kfexander, 19% : 1 15). In his study of 99 drug overdoses in Paris, tngold (1986: 86) determined, sirnitarty, that it \"was though a lethal threshold had been crossed, with [the overdose] death coming as an end to a whole process of unfavourabte deveiopment? At! policies create beneficiaries and victims, as and uni@endd mrrscqueaces. Ow drq gdlcy ir! Canada resped to heroin - - crimimlization -- is supposed to benefit drug users, by reducing availability, and deterring use. The intended victims are supposed to be the traffickers, who are supposed to be deterred from distributing the drug through the threat of the criminal sanction. We seem to have accomplished the reverse: drug users suffer from the faflout uf a drug market regulated by criminal syndicates and the consequences of king labeled criminal, while the intended victims benefit from the illegal status conferred upon heroin, and reap the conseqwnces in terms uf enormous profits generated by the demand for these drugs. Thus, regardless of intentions, laws aimed at criminalizing heroin use do not eliminate (or, it seems reduce) the drug market -- they simpky alter the shape of its operation (Kleiman, 1992:105) in ways that may dramatically increased its potential to cause harm to users: including imsasii\"fli the risk Of owdose. The me occurred during Prohiisiiion, when attempts were made to curtail many d the problems associated witb aicoEloi by pcohimng it Prdrifsition was a faiitae; so is the War on drugs\". If the gad is to prevent heroin over@uses and improve the overail keaith of ~FFUCJ cakd, ad tk wbk idea of a war on drugs abandoned; Ss a very poor metaphor for sociat policy (Kteiman, 1992). This war divides us into allies and enemies (something characteristic af all wars) and prevents us from thinking rationally about drugs, drug users, and the social cirwmstances of drug use. On public health grounds, any drug can be dangerous, but them #angers, as the findings of this study show, are more a function of me in&uidiiaf ard social circumstances of use, than the pkrmacoiogicat quatities of the drug. Moreover, a policy of criminalization, rather than reduce the problems associated with drug abuse, have made them worse. Architects of social poiicy concerned mut the social problems associated with drug abuse would do well to consider these issues- Without such consideration, the goal of reducing the number of people suffering negative consequences (including overdoses) as a resuit of their drug use -- whether it invokes fegaf or iilegaf drugs -- will remain as lifeless as the bodies iying on the patticdogis's table.

Risk factors for atherosclerosis include: hypertension, obesity, cigarette smoking, inability to cope with stress, physical inactivity, and a diet nigh in fat. Autopsy - Systematic examination of the major organs of the body to determine the cause of death; also referred to as the postmortem examination. Bikhral Centriiobuiar Emphysema - A disease state characterized by disturbances in the tissues caused by gas or air in the interstices, or spaces between crgans. Cardiumegaly - An increase in tbe size of the heart. C!wlesterosis of the Gal! bladder - Excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the gaifbladder. Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease - A disease condition which decreases the ability of the lungs to perform their function; also called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Typically associated with chronic tobarn use. Cirrhosis - A chronic disease of the fiver characterized by degenerative changes in the tissues and cells of the organ, and fatty accumulation. Typicaiiy associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Also called alcoholic liver disease. Coronary Arfery Disease - A narrowing of the coronary arteries sufficient enough to prevent adequate blood flow to the heart. This narrowing is usually the result of att.lerosclertisis. Foreign Doubly Refracrile Material - What remains in the body from the adultrants that illicit drugs are combined with. May be found in virtually every organ inciubing: the liver, spieen, and lungs. Half -Life - The time it takes a drug to be reduced to half its original concentration- This measure is commonly used by toxicologists to compare the toxicity of different substances. Hemorrhagic Gastritis - A hemorrhage of the stomach. Believed to be mused by chronic alcohol abuse. Dietary insufficiencies may exacerbate.

HepafoceIIufar Steatasis - Degeneration of the cells of the liver. High Blood Pressure - A diagnostic judgment which must be considered in tandem with a person's age, body build, and previous Wood pressure. V. - Short for Human immunodeficiency Virus. The virus is associated with, and believed to cause, Acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome (A. I. D.S.). intravenous drug useis are at a high risk for acquiring the disease when hypodermic needles are shared with an infected person, as well as when the immune system is weakened.
