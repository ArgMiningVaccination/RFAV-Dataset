Autism Question Have you read any articles regarding Autism development? I'll be a new, first time mom this fall and I've very curious about my baby's health. It's on my mind a lot. I volunteer on weekends with special needs children and love them deeply. But came across some articles recently saying the mothers diet and emotions (chronic stress etc) can play a role in autism development..? Just curious what input y'all might have. TY! [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Autism+Question) A close friend of mine has an autistic child and her brother is autistic as well. I understand it can be environmental influences too but it's not the only time I've seen it run in families. Sure seems to be genetic in a lot of cases. thanks for that input. I agree with you. I'm a teacher and I've come to realise that autism is a spectrum. I find it's used at times as a diagnoses for a variety of different things. There are children who are high functioning and others that are low functioning which is quite different. I've seen children who unfortunately their mothers had difficult births so they were stressed when born and deprived of oxygen and at the time medical professionals assessed and thought they were fine yet later they showed developmental delays and were diagnosed with autism. I've seen children who are part of families who have multiple autism diagnoses so I can't help but think those cases must be due to genetics. I think autism isn't caused by just one factor as there is such a variety in symptoms and levels of functioning that it's almost an umbrella diagnostic term for a range of different things that causes someone to function outside of the 'normal' range. yes all so valid and true. I see the same with the children I volunteer with. Thanks for sharing your insight! I actually do diagnostics so am very well versed in autism. Genetics is the best guess at the moment. Def not Tylenol, vaccines, etc! thank you! what about prenatal stress? In first trimester specifically not at all! Doesn't increase chances of your child having a developmental delay at all I'm not an expert in like...anything. But in my opinion and my observation SO much of who a child is is baked into the cake of their DNA. As parents we want to prevent everything we can and when something inevitably does come up we want to blame ourselves. I don't believe anything in a babies neurological wiring would come down to outside factors like this. And frankly, unless substantiated proof can be established to the contrary, I doubt the speculation of such things is helpful as parents DO tend to saddled themselves with so much guilt unnecessarily. I had an atypical results on my nipt test. After further testing everything came back normal. They then offered a test to determine if the baby would develop anything as it grew up such as autism. I opted out of that as I didn't want to know, but also don't have it in mine or my husbands families. So that told me right there it's believed to be genetics. thank you for sharing! Good info. My oldest will be 4 next month and he finally got his Autism diagnosis this past February. I honestly don't know what to believe about what causes it. My 20 month old is vaccinated like his older brother, I ate a similar diet (if not a little worse) when pregnant with him, and they're full brothers. He's showing no symptoms of having Autism. I do believe it can be genetic though. My older brother didn't talk until he was 7 and was deemed having \"expressive language disorder\" but he shares a lot of similar characteristics to Autism. With my first I did have a vacuum delivery and I've read about possible links of Autism from that...but not sure if true. But Autism is just who he is. He's still a loving little boy who loves trash trucks, getting dirty, cars, trucks, Toy Story, etc. He is definitely super sensitive though, has some behavioral issues, and has a big speech delay. Having his younger brother has helped him more than I could've ever asked for though. I was also told that Autism can't get \"worse\" but only better. I'm very hopeful for his future. no words at all right now but he has his own language if that makes sense. He says di di , gi gi sometimes he'll say hug or it sounds like he's trying to mimic what we say to him. But mostly can't understand what he's trying to say. Everything else seems like normal toddler behavior lol. He hardly ever throws any tantrums. Mine has started to say a few more words! He turned 4 in June and me and my husband both think he will talk one day. he does have some regressions every once in awhile, but any improvement at all is a positive for us. He's so so smart even without many words. He definitely remembers a lot of things from when his little brother was born and I'm excited to see how to reacts to his new brother soon. I definitely recommend talking to your pediatrician and getting your son into speech if you haven't already. The showing of affection is so good. Also, any word approximations definitely count if he has any. I feel like this is what I'm going through right now. My oldest is 3 going on 4 and I have a 1 year old. 3 year old doesn't talk but babbles nonstop and does repetitive things like spinning in circles, shaking his head , turning his head side to side looking around. But it's like little phases everyday. Most of the day he's making eye contact, hugging and kissing on me, happy to play with his toys, loves the alphabet, listens very well. Puts on his shoes and clothes with me. Likes the car and swimming bath time etc. He just has his little moments where he does his ticks. I wonder to myself if there's any hope though for him to actually talk to me though. That's what makes me the most sad. thank you for sharing your personal experience. Your two boys both sound like angels! I don't doubt they are each perfect little boys My eldest son is autistic. He is 19. His uncle (dad's brother) is also autistic, requiring more support than my son. I was 22 when I got pregnant with him and I don't recall a ton of stress, really. We were stable and our relationship was good. I had great prenatal care, too. Who knows? He's a happy young man and today is his birthday. I am thankful he is who he is. He's a great big brother to my other two and he has a really good heart. he certainly sounds like a little Angel and you are a wonderful mommy to him too. Thanks for sharing! hello! I'm curious if he had any speech therapy or anything like that as a toddler? My son doesn't have an autism diagnosis but he has a major speech delay. He makes great eye contact, understands what is being said to him but doesn't say any words but speaks his own \"language\" He'll be 4 December. Just wondering if he's ever going to talk and can't find anyone with anything similar no he did not have speech therapy until he was about 14. He was not delayed but had typical autistic speech patterns (repetitive, echolalia, scripted speaking, and a stutter) He was diagnosed with Cluttering and Stuttering. He responded well to their techniques and still uses them. I know autism has a tendency to run in families, but other than that I believe there's not much known about what exactly causes it. But remember, it's a spectrum-I've worked with many autistic children with some intense challenges. At the same time, my oldest sister was diagnosed as an adult, and she's brilliant-she went to University and used to sing in the opera. I have at least two nephews with autism, we suspect that my dad had undiagnosed autism-he also graduated from a university and was a computer scientist back when it was a brand new field and it was unheard of to have a PC in your home. My husband is also on the spectrum, and we highly suspect that our first son, who has significant developmental delays, is as well, but he's too young for evaluation until September. Working with someone who's neurodivergent can certainly be a challenge, but, as I know from experience, also wonderful. I love this story! Thanks for sharing. I've never once viewed autism as bad or less than. Volunteering with autistic & physically disabled children has enriched my life greatly. It's so nice to hear your experiences too. Just gathering as much info as I can before my little guy arrives It seems to be genetic. I'm a little bit worried about mine because I have spectrumy tendencies but I also had a very rough childhood so it's impossible to tell if it's nature or nuture. My partner definitely has undiagnosed ADHD and a high IQ so it's gonnna be a wait and see. soo interesting and thanks for sharing all of the factors you're considering. Great points to ponder. My husband is highly ADHD but also the most gentle and intelligent man I know. I'll be happy if our boy is like him As a mother of an Autistic son, I can tell you I jumped through every hoop to get my son what he needed and in the end it came down to genetics. We went to Lebonheur and did genetic testing and the whole 9 yards. My brother has a disability and then my 1st born ended up with Autism. For my family, it is passed down from the mother. My son was severe and now at 14, he is no longer in special needs classes. He still has his quirks but flourishes more & more every day. My advice would be take everything with a grain of salt and do your research. That's amazing that you were able to get your son to the point where he didn't need those classes anymore! It definitely gives me hope with my little guy, whatever will happen. well your son & you both sound like amazing people! Thanks for sharing your beautiful journey Thank you so much!
