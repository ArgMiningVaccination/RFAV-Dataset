Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) An easy way to acquire a collection of stones for psychic power & Spiritual healing. Otherwise you have to search for each individual stone & purchase them individually. The only complaint I have is is the pouch is not quite big enough to hold all of the wonderful stones in this collection. Quality stones and service make a buying experience enjoyable.
