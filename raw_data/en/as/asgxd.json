But finding a qualified provider is essential to reap the benefits \u2014 here are a few tips to get started. If you're interested in using integrative medicine approaches to bolster your health, you're not alone. Research from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/5266) shows that more than one-third of U.S. adults use complementary and integrative medicine for their health needs. According to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to healthcare approaches that aren't typically part of conventional medical care but may be used in tandem with it. (Note that the term \"alternative medicine\" is less commonly used, so as not to suggest that these therapies and approaches should replace conventional medical care.) A few examples of complementary health approaches include [massage therapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/massage-therapy/guide/), chiropractic or osteopathic medicine, [acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/), and [mindfulness](https://www.everydayhealth.com/mindfulness/), per the NCCIH. People use complementary medicine for various reasons, from reducing pain and nausea to improving mood and fatigue, per the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16883-complementary-therapy). But when conventional and complementary approaches are combined in a coordinated way, as when patients with cancer use [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) to help lessen side effects of standard [cancer treatments](/cancer/guide/treatment/), this is known as integrative medicine, explains the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam). In other words, integrative medicine brings conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way and emphasizes whole-person health, per the NCCIH. Complementary and integrative medicine practitioners often provide services and therapies in conventional healthcare settings such as hospitals and clinics. Practitioners can also be found in private practice and at wellness centers. Unfortunately, finding a qualified complementary and integrative medicine practitioner to provide safe and effective care isn't always easy. But it's essential to choose carefully, as some complementary therapies may have adverse effects if performed incorrectly. To get started, keep these tips in mind when selecting a complementary provider so you can build a healthcare team that suits your needs and concerns. 1. Get Clarity on Your Health Condition or Goal Before you start looking for a specific practitioner, it's helpful to identify which CAM therapies or approaches could be appropriate for your health condition or goal. Determining the right CAM therapy starts with what question you want answered, says [Cassie Wilder, ND](https://mplsimc.com/dr-cassie-wilder/), the founder of Minneapolis Integrative Medicine Center in Minnesota. For example, do you have a [grouping of chronic symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/manage-stress-with-integrative-medicine/) but no diagnosis? If that's the case, you should look for a provider with medical credentials who may be able to help you diagnose your concern. \"That might be a functional medicine nurse practitioner or naturopathic doctor,\" Dr. Wilder says. Other options might include asking your primary care provider for integrative doctor recommendations within your hospital network or searching the [MedlinePlus directories](https://medlineplus.gov/directories/), per the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/how-to-find-a-complementary-health-practitioner). If you have a diagnosis, ask yourself: What do I need help with to feel most supported as I address my concerns? For example, consider what symptoms you'd like to soothe if you've been diagnosed with [hypothyroidism](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hypothyroidism/guide/). (This condition occurs when the [thyroid gland](/thyroid/guide/) doesn't make enough hormones, per [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/hypothyroidism.html).) Perhaps you're experiencing symptoms like fatigue, [constipation](/constipation/guide/), or joint and muscle pain, despite taking conventional medications. In that case, some complementary therapies, like acupuncture to alleviate fatigue, could help, Wilder says. If you're unsure which complementary therapies might suit your health condition or goal, you can consult a general integrative doctor or your primary care physician for guidance, Wilder says. 2. Evaluate the Integrative Practitioner's Credentials Once you decide which type of complementary practitioner best fits your health condition or complaint, check the practitioner's education, training, licensing, and certifications. Unlike in conventional healthcare, there is no standard national system for credentials for complementary health practitioners, per the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/tips/things-to-know-when-selecting-a-complementary-health-practitioner). In fact, credentialing requirements for complementary and integrative health practitioners vary widely from state to state and from discipline to discipline. Research the complementary medicine field you're interested in to see what credentials practitioners must have if any. Here's a breakdown of the requirements for a handful of integrative practitioners, approaches, and therapies: - Integrative Medicine Some medical doctors and doctors of osteopathic medicine with various backgrounds (like internal medicine, psychiatry, and pediatrics) have also trained in integrative medicine and may offer complementary therapies by themselves or with a team. To find databases for these practitioners, you can check the [Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine](https://aihm.org/), the [Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health](https://imconsortium.org/member-map/), the [University of Arizona Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/alumni.html), and the [American Board of Physician Specialities](https://www.abpsus.org/specializations/integrative-medicine/). - Naturopathic Medicine Seventeen states and the District of Columbia license naturopathic physicians. In general, naturopathic physicians must graduate from an accredited four-year naturopathic medicine school and pass a postdoctoral board exam. The [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education](https://cnme.org/)is one organization that provides accreditation for naturopathic medicine schools. - Chiropractic Medicine In all 50 states and the District of Columbia, chiropractors must be an accredited doctor of chiropractic and pass special state exams, exams administered by the [National Board of Chiropractic Examiners](https://www.nbce.org/), or both. - Massage Therapy Most states require massage therapists to have a license, certification, or registration and a minimum of 500 hours of training. The [National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork](https://www.ncbtmb.org/)is one organization that provides credentials and standards of excellence for massage therapists. - Acupuncture Therapy In most states, acupuncturists must be certified by the [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine](https://www.nccaom.org/)or pass that organization's licensure exams. If you can't readily find information about a practitioner's education and training, be sure to ask them about their background before you make an appointment, Wilder says. 3. Ensure That They Have Experience With Your Health Concern If you're exploring complementary or integrative medicine to help manage a health condition, choose a practitioner with ample experience working with people with your condition, suggests the NCCIH. Finding a practitioner who understands how to address your specific health needs is essential, even if your main goal is to improve general well-being. As the NCCIH notes, certain health conditions can affect the safety and effectiveness of complementary therapies, and may have harmful interactions that you should discuss with your provider before trying any new therapeutic approaches. For example, certain [yoga poses](/fitness-pictures/yoga-poses-for-beginners.aspx) may be harmful for people with an eye disease known as [glaucoma](/glaucoma/guide/), per the [American Academy of Ophthalmology](https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/glaucoma-and-exercise). 4. Ask if They're Willing to Work With Other Healthcare Providers It's important to keep other members of your healthcare team, such as specialists and primary care physicians, in the loop when using complementary therapies. Typically, medical doctors and doctors of osteopathic medicine trained in integrative medicine, as well as doctors of naturopathic medicine, will be in contact with your medical care team, especially if they are practicing within an academic healthcare setting. Likewise, let your complementary practitioner know of any changes to your health or care regimen. Depending on your situation, your complementary practitioner may even need to work with your other healthcare providers to build a safe, coordinated care plan specific to you, per the NCCIH. For example, some patients may work with an acupuncturist and registered dietitian in addition to their physicians to help manage the side effects of cancer treatments. \"Holistic care demands professionals who are willing to take a 360-degree view of the patient's situation,\" says [Maryanna Klatt, PhD](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/family-medicine/maryanna-klatt-phd), the director of the Center for Integrative Health at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. So if you're interested in using complementary medicine alongside conventional treatments for a health condition, ask your complementary or integrative practitioner if they're willing to work with other healthcare members on your team. 5. Consider Whether They Match Your Personality Finding a complementary healthcare provider who's a good fit isn't just about the practitioner's credentials. It's also important to choose a provider you get along with. \"It's like finding a dance partner. It's a match between human beings,\" says Dr. Klatt. The only way to know for certain is to meet with your potential provider, either virtually or in person to get a feel for whether you'll enjoy working together. Remember: Just as you select other members of your healthcare team, it's okay to be picky. Don't be afraid to keep looking until you find a complementary provider who's a good match. \"It's worth the effort,\" Klatt says. "}
