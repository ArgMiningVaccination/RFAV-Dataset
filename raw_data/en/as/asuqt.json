High \"index of awareness\" 2. Remember key risks 3. Multiple key clinical features 4. Early sophisticated imaging 5. Repetitive testing You don't have pancreatic cancer unless a biopsy proves you do 8/18/2014 8 8/18/2014 9 Pancreatic cancer: Standard evaluation History and Physical Examination CBC/diff/plt/chemistry panel CA19.9 Chest imaging CT scan of abdomen using special imaging techniques for pancreas detail 8/18/2014 10 Pancreatic cancer: Basic categories Pancreatic cancer Localized Metastatic Cure as many people as possible ! Turn into a chronic disease Is it RESECTABLE ???? 8/18/2014 11 Complete resection of pancreatic cancer is usually necessary, but usually not sufficient for a permanent cure Localized- initially resectable 15% Treatments Metastatic pancreatic cancer: Options for treatment 1. Supportive care ( especially if function limited ) 2. Chemotherapy - fluoropyrimidine-based (e.g. FOLFIRINOX) or gemcitabine- based (e.g. gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) 3. Clinical trial 8/18/2014 13 Pancreatic (Conroy et.al. NEJM patients, phase III Response rate nearly 3x higher than gemcitabine Time to progression 2x higher than gemcitabine ( p<.00001) Overall survival 50% longer than gemcitabine But........... Harder, more expensive to use, side effects greater 8/18/2014 15 Gem/nab-paclitaxel in metastatic pancreatic cancer (von Hoff. NEJM 2013) 861 patients, randomized phase III Response rate more than 3x higher than gemcitabine Time to progression ~50% longer than gemcitabine Overall survival ~ 1/3 longer than gemcitabine Easier to take than FOLFIRINOX for most patients MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER 8/18/2014 16 You need an experienced surgeon ! Pancreatic cancer: Surgical volume and outcome (Birkmeyer NEJM 2002) cures pancreatic cancer only 10% of the time! Therefore, even when pancreatic cancer is removed or localized, since it has usually already spread (about 90% ofthe time) (i.e. a systemic disease), systemic therapy ( i.e. drugs) should be given.... ...but how best ?? 8/18/2014 19 Pancreatic cancer: Treatment of resected disease Observation - probably not a good option for patients willing able to take therapy Chemotherapy only - gemcitabine or 5FU/LV for 6 months is the standard of care Chemotherapy / XRT - patients with high risk of local recurrence, good in experienced centers Clinical trial MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER 8/18/2014 20 Pancreatic cancer: Treatment of locally advanced disease Supportive care Chemotherapy only Chemotherapy / XRT Clinical trial but , different expectations than in resectable disease Pancreatic Cancer: Clinical Trials 8/18/2014 21 8/18/2014 22 HR 733 / S 362 8/18/2014 23 Pancreatic cancer: Types of clinical trials Phase I Safety Phase II Effect ( does it work ?)
