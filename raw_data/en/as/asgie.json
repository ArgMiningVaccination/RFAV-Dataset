P A G E 5 How To Wash Cloth Face Coverings Cloth face coverings should be washed after each use. It is important to always remove face coverings correctly and wash your hands after handling or touching a used face covering. You can include your face covering with your regular laundry. Use regular laundry detergent and the warmest appropriate water setting for the cloth used to make the face covering. Washing by hand: Prepare a bleach solu- tion by mixing 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) household bleach per gallon of room tem- perature water or 4 teaspoons household bleach per quart of room temperature wa- ter Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection. Some bleach products, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing, may not be suita- ble for disinfection. Ensure the bleach prod- uct is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Soak the face covering in the bleach solution for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cool or room temperature water. Make sure to completely dry cloth face cov- ering after washing. Dryer: Use the highest heat setting and leave in the dryer until completely dry. Air dry: Lay flat and allow to completely dry. If possible, place the cloth face covering in direct sunlight. Source: cdc.gov P A G E 6 June Wellness Themes Men 's Health Month June is Men 's Health Month. On average, men die five years younger than women, and die at higher rates from nine of the top 10 causes of death. Men are also less likely than women to be insured. All of this impacts their ability to be involved fathers, supportive partners, and engaged commu- nity members. There are quite a few things you can do to help men all year. Let's start with Dad: Encourage him to get a physical. Most of the factors that contribute to men 's short- er, less healthy lives are preventable. And that prevention starts with seeing a healthcare provider on a regular basis. Adult men in the United States visit prima- ry care providers at lower rates than adult women. Establishing baselines for factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, and PSA (a screening test for pros- tate cancer risk) \u2014and monitoring how they change over time \u2014will enable the provider to catch potentially dangerous conditions early, when they 're still treata- ble. Go to www.healthfinder.gov to down- load a helpful charts on the latest recom- mended screenings for men. Encourage males in your family to get physical. The benefits of physical activity on health outcomes are extensive, and many people find it difficult to get motivat- ed for physical activity on their own. Ra- ther than simply telling your dad to exer- cise and then hoping that he will, do it with him. Join a recreation league at your local community center, sign up for group personal training sessions to get fit togeth- er, or simply make a routine out of regular walks.

These are issues to be wary of year -round, but they 're particularly tricky in warmer weather. \"Staying hydrated in the heat can be more challenging than in cooler tem- peratures because we lose a significant amount of fluid through our skin in the form of sweat, \" Jonah Soolman, RD, a nutritionist and certified trainer at Sool- man Nutrition and Wellness in Welles- ley, Mass. tells Health . Since we need to replace the fluid lost in that sweat, Soolman explains that \"our hydration needs tend to be higher than when the temperature is more mild or cold.\" TIPS! Drink water \u2014and plenty of it Eat food with high water content like ; melons, tropical fruits, cucumbers, and grapes Know the signs of dehydration Check your urine Avoid alcohol, sugary drinks, and/or caffeine Cool down Eat foods with high water content Replenish when you sweat.

So meal planning is one of the major task that has a lasting impact on our physical and emotion health and wellbeing. Use this the 3 steps below to assist you with making conscious eating and planning decision to eliminate the stress of mealtime. Let's face it, life's hec- tic. How to Plan? Step 1: Make a Budget & Menu First, think about how much you are going to spend weekly for each meal and what type of menu you are planning \u2014 do you : Want to make a weekly or a monthly plan? Using Themes Like Taco Tues- day! This can help you save money. Prefer to prepare meals ahead of time, just before the meal or a combination of both? Want to pick a day to cook meals for the week or a month that you can store in the freezer? Need to consider any special nutrition needs for yourself or your family? Next, either on a sheet of paper, in your phone or on or the computer, create your menu: Take a minute to read about how to put together a healthy meal and make sure you are getting the right amount of each of the 5 food groups. Flip through cookbooks or online sites and find recipes that look good. Evaluate the level of cooking skills required to make the recipe. Do you have those skills? If not, are you up for the challenge? Also, make sure that you have the special cooking uten- sils or pans needed for the recipe. Check in with your family about their schedules and meal preferences. Weigh those factors as you put together your menu. Do you want to plan pasta dishes with salads, for the summer or Hearty soups and stews which are ideal for a cold winter 's night. A salad with lean protein can make a perfect entr\u00e9e on a hot summer day. If you are packing lunches, make sure any perishables can be stored in a refrigerator or in an insulated bag with an ice pack. Find out what ingredients you already have on hand. It is best to continually ro- tate foodstuffs rather than store them for long periods of time. So, try to use up the items that you have on hand. You 'll also save money! Check out the sales at your local supermar- kets. Sometimes a discounted price can allow you to treat yourself and your family to a special meal. Remember: produce that is in season tends to be less expen- sive. Aim for variety in meals; but, don 't feel like every day must be different. It's OK to have oatmeal or low -fat yogurt with ber- ries several times a week for breakfast. The same goes for lunch; pick a few op- tions and rotate them across a week. Jot down breakfast, lunch and dinner options. And, don 't forget about healthy snacks. Think about how to handle lefto- vers. Decide if you serve them again that week or freeze them for another week? Remember to consider food safety, as re- frigerated leftovers should be used up within three to four days or frozen for later use. Run the menu by others in your house- hold. Does it look good to them? Make any adjustments needed. During the week, keep notes about how well the menu worked. These notes can remind you of ways to save money, im- prove your recipes and menu. Importance of Meal Planning P A G E 13 Step 2: Stock Your Pantry and Freezer with the Five Food Groups To help get started with meal planning, take time to stock up on the basics. This includes healthy foods that you like to eat and pre- pare. The lists below provide pantry and freezer items to stock up on from the five food groups. Circle the items you want to stock in your pantry and freezer. Plus, add other items based on your personal health needs and food and family preferences. Five Food Groups Pantry List Vegetables: Keep a variety of canned toma- toes in stock (diced, crushed, whole, stewed). Use them in soups, stews, sauces, casseroles and more! Also, pick up a bottle of your favorite spaghetti sauce. Dried mushrooms are another great pantry item because they can add depth of flavor to your meals. Fruits: Raisins, dried cranberries, dried apri- cots and other dried fruits are loaded with dietary fiber. They add a punch of flavor to your morning breakfast, midday salad and dinner grains. Dairy Products : High in calcium, and pro- tein. Dried milk is a great back -up item to have on stock. You can use it in your coffee or tea. Boxed milk is also available in single - serving packages and is a great item for lunch boxes. Evaporated milk, available in cans in the baking aisle, can be substituted for liquid milk in most recipes. , try Non - dairy options like soy, rice or almond bever- ages. They are rich in calcium also. Protein Foods : Lean cuts of meat, fish, chicken, legumes - tock up on canned or dried lentils, black, pinto, cannellini, garban- zo and kidney beans. These legumes are a great source of protein. Toss cooked beans in salads, soups, stews and other dishes. Canned tuna, anchovies and sardines are a pantry must \u2014 they are a quick way to add protein, healthy fats and flavor to meals. Whole Grains : Keep a stash of oatmeal, buckwheat and other whole -grain cereals in the pantry. For an extra boost, add nuts and fresh berries to these hot cereals. Barley, farro, millet, brown rice, oats, quinoa and other grains provide staples for healthy meals. Also, keep a variety of rice on hand \u2014 long grain, short grain, basmati and brown rice. Spaghetti, ziti, penne and other pastas are great for an easy, quick and filling family meal. Give yourself an extra nutrition boost by buying whole -grain pasta or trying pasta made from legumes. Also, stock up on: Condiments: Ketchup, mustard and relish can be stored in the pantry until they are opened. Once you open them, keep them in the fridge. Oil and vinegar : Extra -virgin olive oil is a versatile, heart -healthy option. Other oils, such as peanut, walnut and sesame add a burst of flavor to meals. Pick up different types of vinegar, such as cider, white and balsamic. Each imparts a unique flavor to your recipes. Stock : Vegetable, chicken and beef stock are the basics of many recipes. Opt for those are low -sodium or contain no added salt. Herbs and spices : Pick up small containers of ground herbs and spices. That way they are as fresh as possible when you use them. Rich in Omega 3 -Flax and other seeds: Flax and chia seeds deliver of protein, fiber and omega -3 fatty acids. Add them to cereal, salads, sauces and home -baked goods. If you buy whole flaxseed, make sure you grind it up before eating so your body can absorb the nutrients Five Food Groups Freezer List To help make sure you don 't store food be- yond freshness, put dates on the packages before storing in the freezer. And, use the oldest first. Importance of Meal Planning Follow these three steps and you'll be planning nutritious meals that fit your preferences and lifestyle. P A G E 14 Importance of Meal Planning Vegetables: Pick up some of your favorite frozen veggies. These are a great source of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients be- cause the flash -freezing process locks in the nutrition. Look for packages without sodi- um. And, while you are in the produce aisle, grab some fresh herbs. When you get home, fill ice cube trays with chopped herbs, top off the herbs with boiling water, and care- fully place in the freezer. Add these herbs cubes for a punch of freshness to your meals. Fruits: Stash frozen berries and other fruits in the freezer. They are a great way to add nutrition to a morning smoothie. Milk and Dairy Products: Freeze Parmesan and other pre -shredded cheeses \u2014 toss them into soups, stews and pasta dishes. Low fat, frozen yogurt can be a quick des- sert for a special occasion. Protein Foods: Stock up on salmon and oth- er fatty fishes to ensure you have ready ac- cess to healthy fats. Frozen lean meats and poultry also store well in the freezer. One tip: make sure you move it to the refrigera- tor one day before cooking to give adequate time for defrosting. Keep a variety of nuts in the freezer. This helps prevent them from spoiling. Add them to cold cereal, salads, hot grains and other dishes. Grains: Whole -grain corn tortillas freeze well and can be used for quick breakfasts, lunches or dinners. Can 't eat that loaf of bread fast enough while it is fresh? Make it a habit to freeze part of the loaf and defrost slices as you need them. Step 3: Keep a Running Grocery List In a convenient place keep a pad and pen and, as you use up grocery items, write them down on the list. This way you do not have to worry about forgetting anything when you hit the supermarket. Or, use an app for that. There are many grocery shopping apps available for both iOS and Android platforms. Some apps even include infor- mation on where to get the best deals on food prices. For example, after you enter your list, the app might suggest which local supermarket has the best prices for those items. Others allow you to sort your list into categories for ease of shopping. And, meal planning options also are special features of some apps. Don't forget to follow your Budget On your list \u2014 .Think about how often you are able and want to shop. Plus, think about your plan for meals and check to see what ingredients you already have and what items you need. Remember to check the cabinets, pantry, fridge and freezer. Ideally, you want to continually use what you have on hand so that your meals are made with fresh ingredients and this will also help re- duce food waste.

As we age, getting a baseline eye exam can detect early signs of disease or damage to your eyes. Ophthalmologists recommend peri- odic eye exams every 2 -4 years from the ages of 40 to 65, and every 1 -2 years after the age of 65. While most symptoms are often disregarded, getting a simple check- up and following a doctor 's orders can greatly lower risks of more severe and future damage, and you can continue to enjoy healthy vision. 1. It's estimated that around 12.2 million Americans need vision correction. 2. Somewhere around half of all children under the age of 12 have never had their eyes checked. 3. Good vision improves work performance. It 's tough to focus at work if you 're having vision problems, which may contribute to reading and concentration issues. 4. Eye exams can reveal much more than simply the health of your eyes \u2014such as issues with diabetes, glaucoma, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. 5. Many diseases that affect the eye often do not have warning symptoms, but can have severe effects on vision and eye health later on. Eye conditions can often be easily managed when caught early.

Research has shown that being breastfed can lead to a healthier life for babies. The many health benefits include: Protection against many common in- fections Nutritionally balanced meals Better survival for the first year of life While the benefits toward babies are nu-merous, the health benefits of breast feed- ing extend to mothers as well. Breastfeed- ing has been found to help a mother 's heal- ing after the trauma of childbirth, and has also shown to lower the risk of diseases including: Certain Types of Breast Cancer Ovarian Cancer Type 2 Diabetes While formula is an acknowledged alterna- tive, keep in mind the benefits shared by mothers and children by breastfeeding!

Now, there is a concern for how do we care for our children while working and schooling at home, and not panic during this unprece- dented outbreak? How do to support families if by chance there is a need to continue with working from home and online schooling. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggest these tips to help families cope with this \"new normal\" until the virus is under control. The main thing is to talk to your children about the guidelines for staying a home for possibly another school year. Keep the routine. Give regular breaks, and opportunities to exercise. Slow the Spread \u2014It may be tempting to get kids together for play dates or sleepovers, but this should be avoided. Social distancing only works if we all participate. And slowing down or preventing the spread of the virus will save lives. Protect grandparents and Older Adults \u2014This is also not the time to visit grandparents or ask them to help out with child care duties. People who are over age 60 are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID -19 and should not increase that risk by being around chil- dren who may be ill with mild symptoms. Keep a daily Routine \u2014Here are some ideas to help you create a daily schedule: Wake up, get dressed and have breakfast at the normal time. Decide where everyone can do their work most effectively and without distractions. For younger children, 20 minutes of class assignments followed by 10 minutes of physical activity might work well. Older children and teens may be able to focus on assignments for longer stretches, taking breaks between subjects. Include your hours as well, so your children know when the work day is done. Schedule time for nutritious lunches and snacks . Many schools are providing take -home school meal packages for students who need them. Have dinner together as a family and discuss the day. Have Prayer, or Relaxation Time together Enjoy more family time in the evenings, playing, reading, watching a movie or exercising together. Stick to normal bedtime routines as much as possible to reduce irritation and anxiety. Source: https://www.healthychildren.org/ Working and Learning From Home Tips .

Sadly, suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is on the rise in nearly every state in the country. Please Seek Help ! Prostate Cancer Awareness Month National Prostate Health Month (NPHM), also known as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, is observed every Sep- tember in North America. Here 's a look at the top five foods to eat for a healthy prostate: Fish: Cold -water fish like salmon, sardines, , tuna, and trout) provide \"good fats \" that help prevent inflammation in the body. Over the past few years, scientists have begun to see inflammation within the prostate as a dangerous condition that can make it easier for cancer to take hold. Omega 3 fatty acids (you may have heard about them as EPA and DHA), are essential fats that our bodies can 't make, so we need to get them from food sources. If you aren 't wild about fish, you can find Berries \u2014Berries are great source, particu- larly strawberries, blackberries, blueber- ries, and raspberries (the brighter the better). These fruits offer up powerful antioxidants known as anthocyanin's. Cooked tomatoes \u2014Lycopene is another powerful antioxidant and is found in the cell walls of tomatoes. The cooking pro- cess loosens the bond, making it easier for our bodies to access the antioxidant and send it to the prostate. Tomato sauce, paste, juice, and sundried tomatoes help our bodies make the most of this nutri- tional superstar. Even better: tomatoes cooked in olive oil. Broccoli \u2014Broccoli contains the phyto- chemical (phytol means \"plant \") sul- foraphane, which is suspected to target and kill cancer cells while leaving healthy prostate cells to fight another day. Studies suggest that eating cruciferous vegetables can lower your risk of getting prostate cancer. Don 't like brocco- li? There are other vegetables in the same family that have similar beneficial effects, including cabbage, boy choy, kale, cauli- flower and Brussels sprouts. Another great source of antioxidants, this versatile leaf contains multiple antioxidant compounds called catechins (most im- portant for epigallo- catechin -3-gallate, and epicatechin), which are believed to be anti -carcinogenic and anti-mutagenic (preventing healthy cells from mutating). A review of multiple stud- ies found that men who drank five cups of green tea per day had a decreased risk of prostate cancer. Green Tea By increasing your intake of healthy fats, antioxidants, and anti -inflammatory foods, you can help keep your prostate healthy.

Did you know that im- proving your food choices can alter your mood and make your feel better. This is important because our bodies normally make molecules called free radicals, that can lead to cell damage, aging, and other problems. Eating foods like fresh fruits and vegetables are rich in Antioxidants which prevents Cell Damage. Studies show that your brain is particularly at risk. Although there's no way to stop free radicals completely, you can lessen their destructive effect by eating foods rich in antioxidants, including: Beta -carotene Rich : apricots, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, peaches, pumpkin, spinach, sweet potatoes. Vitamin C: blueberries, broccoli, grapefruit, kiwi, oranges, peppers, potatoes, strawber- ries, tomatoes. Vitamin E: margarine, nuts and seeds, vegetable oils, wheat germ Choose your Carbs Wisely - Eating complex or smart carb can have a calming effect on emotional health \u2014Carbohydrates are linked to the mood -boosting brain chemical, sero- tonin. Experts aren't sure, but carb cravings sometimes may be related to low serotonin activity . Limit sugary foods and opt for smart or \"complex \" carbs (such as whole grains) rather than simple carbs (such as cakes and cookies). Fruits, vegetables, and legumes also have healthy carbs and fiber. Eating Clean Protein -Rich Foods Can Boost Alertness, Foods like turkey, tuna, and chick- en have an amino acid called tryptophan, which may help you make serotonin. Try to eat something with protein several times a day, especially when you need to clear your mind and boost your energy. Good sources of healthy proteins include beans and peas, lean beef, low -fat cheese, fish, milk, poultry, soy products, and yogurt. Choice a Better Eating Plan or Diet \u2014 Try the Mediterranean Diet to boost B Vitamins A Spanish study found that rates of depression tended to rise in men -- especially smokers -- as they got less folate. The same thing happened for women -- especially those who smoked or didn't exercise -- but when they got less vitamin B12. This wasn't the first study to find a link between these vitamins and depression. Researchers aren't sure which way the influence goes: do poor nutrient levels lead to depression, or does depression lead people to eat poorly? In either case, you can get both of these B vitamins from foods in a Mediterranean diet . Legumes, nuts, many fruits, and dark green vegetables have folate. Vitamin B12 can be found in all lean and low -fat animal products, such as fish and low-fat dairy products. Source: https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/diet -recovery#1 Foods to Improve The Mood !
