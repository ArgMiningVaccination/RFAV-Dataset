In Eastern philosophy, when your energy or Qi has been altered, you have pain, illness, and disease. Using a needle and specic points along meridians, this returns the Qi back to its original flow promoting healing, pain relief, and restoration of the body's resting state. One of the oldest forms of medicine, it has been practiced for over 3,000 years. Eastern medicine acupuncture is based on the philosophy that our energy or qi, is not moving correctly and this lack of energy flow leads to pain, illness, and disease. Correcting this flow of energy will promote health and wellness. According to this paradigm, energy moves through the body along 14 main pathways, called meridians, and when the flow along one or several of the meridians is obstructed, the result may be disease or injury. By stimulating key points in the body \u2014 most commonly with needles - an acupuncturist seeks to restore balance to the normal energy flow and, consequently, to relieve pain or treat disease. During an acupuncture treatment, tiny one- or two-inch needles are inserted at selected acupuncture points. Acupuncturists recognize nearly 400 of these special locations on each side of the body, and another 250 to 300 \"extra-meridian\" points outside the meridian lines. Manual or electrical manipulation of the needle or the application of heat or cold to the handle will change the polarity and direction of the current. Needles properly placed at selected points allow the current to circulate between the needle tips. Patients generally complain of little or no discomfort from the needles. A common introduction is a feeling of heaviness or numbness at the insertion sites. Common conditions that are treated by acupuncture: - Anxiety I Depression - Stress - Chronic pain - Fertility - Menopause related symptoms - Weight-loss - Smoking cessation - TMJ - Tinnitus - Nausea - Fibromyalgia "}
