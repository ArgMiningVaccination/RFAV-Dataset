Her book does not take an academic or theological path but one that is personal and full of warmth and genuine interest in discovery that goes toward living reality, well beyond mere names and xed ideas. As Schaefer says, she decided to \"forego the idea of a straightforward narrative and instead interweave musings, poems, saved quotations, and other assorted notes from my many years of living with questions about and to her.\" The author tells us, Questions of inner growth, of spiritual striving, of how to bear the suffering in the world without going under, and perhaps most of all, of how to love, often present themselves surrounded by veils. In acknowledging a question, the veil may begin to shift. Our questions matter; bringing them to consciousness, exploring them with others, waiting with an open heart for the spirit to speak\u2014this is the ongoing work of unveiling. Sophia is rightly seen as the living, moving being of universal wisdom and the archetypal feminine, but Schaefer helps us to see her as more\u2014as an expression of what humanity must rightfully become. Signe Schaefer has been a long-time adult educator and was for many years the Director of Foundation Studies at Sunbridge College. She was the founding Director of a professional development training in Biography and Social Art. Since retiring she has published three books: Why on Earth? Biography and the Practice of Human Becoming; I Give You My Word: Women's Letters as Life Support; and most recently, She Was Always There - Sophia as a Story for our Time. She also co-authored Ariadne's Awakening: Taking up the Threads of Consciousness and co-edited More Lifeways. A mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she now lives in Great Barrington, MA with her husband Christopher. With Rev. Rafal Nowak of the Christian Community, Los Angeles Saturday, June 24, 2023 11:00 AM/ Potluck Lunch to follow The Waldorf School of San Diego High School 4135 54th Pl, San Diego, CA ...\"The festival of St. John reminds us that the greatest Individuality who participated in the evolution of humanity was preceded by a 'Forerunner', and we here touch upon an important point which must precede our further considerations, also as a kind of 'forerunner'. In the course of the development of humanity there occur, ever and again, events of surpassing importance shedding a stronger light than others. We can observe these essential occurrences in epoch after epoch of history, and ever and again we are told of men who, in a measure, know of them in advance and can foretell their coming. These are no arbitrary events; indeed, whoever has insight into the whole meaning and spirit of human history is aware that such events must come and knows how he himself must work in preparation for them to take place.\" We invite all to join us in welcoming Rev. Nowak from Los Angeles. Rafal grew up in Krakow, Poland and has lived in the U.S. since 2000. Since his ordination in the Christian Community he has served in Darmstadt, Germany and Sacramento before arriving in Los Angeles. He is also the Director of Camp Tamarack, a summer camp program for youth in the California Sierras. Steiner, Rudolf, Gospel of St. John, GA112, Lecture 1.

From 10AM until 3PM (with one hour lunch break at 12PM) (*lunch not provided) The Waldorf School of San Diego, Colina Campus 4135 54th Place, San Diego, CA 92105 A conscious explorative experience of the art of speaking through The Foundation Stone Meditation. In our offering we will work with this homeopathic verse & Rudolf Steiner's practical speech exercises with a view to the possibilities we have daily to heal the word in our private and community life. Your body is an instrument that can be tuned, allowing the word to sing forth, creatively, consciously creating your reality and through that, a deep healing can begin. To one who understands the sense of speech The world unveils its image form. To one who listens to the soul of speech The world unfolds its true being. To one who lives in the spirit depths of speech The world gives freely Wisdom's strength. To one who lovingly dwells on speech Speech will accord its inner might. So I will turn my heart and mind Toward the soul and spirit of words. In love for them I will feel myself complete and whole. \u2014Rudolf Steiner Christine Burke, Creative Speech Artist and professor of communication, works in the public sector teaching Communication Studies, in Waldorf Teacher Trainings and Schools and in workshops around the world teaching Rudolf Steiner's Formative Speech. As an active collegium member of the Social Sciences Section in North America, Christine endeavors to foster community and artistic connections in a variety of ways both within the context of anthroposophical encounters and in the world at large.
