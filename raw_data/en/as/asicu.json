The first consists of linkages (RegFlu) between various registries that cover the whole population of Norway of almost 5 million people. The second is the administration of a questionnaire (MoBaFlu) to about 90,000 women participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The third is a pregnancy cohort that is planned to include rough ly 4,000 women expected to give birth in four central hospitals in the period March-Augus t 2010. This last project is called the Norwegian Influenza Cohort Study (NorFlu). NorFlu includes pregnant women recruited late in the second trimester of pregnancy who will be followed with their children for many years. Data is collected by questionnaires and regi stries, and biological specimens are taken after birth from the women and from the umbilical c ord. The aims are to estimate associations between infection, vaccination and med ication as exposures and various diseases and traits as outcomes. In this protocol w e will only briefly mention RegFlu and MoBaFlu, but will give a detailed description of No rFlu. Background The new influenza A (H1N1) pandemic represents a po tential risk to pregnant women and the fetus. Infection during pregnancy with this new vir us has been associated with severe symptoms and hospitalization (1). During seasonal influenza outbreaks and previous pandemics, pregnant women have had increased morbidity and mortality (2 , 3). A study of Australian and New Zealand intensive care units reported that 9 % of a dmissions due to Influenza A (H1N1) were otherwise healthy, pregnant women (4). Some influen za viruses have been found to cross the placental barrier (5). It has been speculated that influenza during pregnancy has adverse affects on the fetus and later health in children (6,7). Ho wever, results are conflicting (8), and it is reasonable to believe that genes as well as environ mental factors might modify effects of infection. Carefully conducted cohort studies that can resolve these issues are lacking (9). An international expert meeting recently convened by t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded there is an urgent need for im proved information on the effects of influenza on the fetus and on the effectiveness, ph armacokinetics and safety of anti-influenza drugs during pregnancy (10). More research and bett er surveillance of the pregnant woman and her child is needed to develop better strategies fo r protection in later influenza epidemics. We need to know whether fetal health may be influenced by transmission of the influenza virus, by maternal immunological reactions during the infecti on, or by the maternal illness itself (prolonged fever, respiratory difficulties). Also, more knowledge on the effects of antiviral medication is needed. Vaccinations in pregnancy may also have beneficial effects on child morbidity in the first three years of life, reducin g the occurrence of respiratory tract infections. Although influenza vaccines are regarded as safe, m any pregnant women are cautious about the possible hazards of immunization, and improved surv eillance of pregnant women may be of benefit for reducing unwarranted anxiety. Due to di fferences between women who are vaccinated and those who refuse vaccination, it is difficult to study the effects of influenza vaccines without detailed information about charact eristics and other illnesses in the pregnant women (11). The proportion of tested persons with confirmed new influenza A (H1N1) in Norway increased steadily in the autumn of 2009. By October 27th 2009, 2584 cases of influenza A (H1N1) had 4 been confirmed in Norway ( www.msis.no ), while an estimated 175 000 persons were likely to have or have had the disease. By week 42, 142 pati ents had been submitted to hospital care, 27 of these (19%) in intensive care units. As of Octob er 28 th , 13 persons had died from influenza A (H1N1). Vaccination started at approximately the sa me time (week 43). The disease severity spanned from very little symptoms to a life threate ning condition. The proportion of infected persons that develop severe disease is not known. Among the confirmed cases in Norway by October 27 th , 1284 were women. As illustrated in figure 1, 470 of these (36%) were women between 20 and 40 years. The proportion of pregnant women among these is not known. One woman developed severe disease in pregnancy and died shortly after delivery. Figure 1. Number of women with confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) in Norway, May 1st- October 27th, 2009. From www.msis.no 14 152 393 306 164 146 82 22 3 2 0100 200 300 400 <1yr 1-9 yrs 10-19 50-59 yrs 60-69 yrs 70-79 yrs 80 + yrs Age group Number of infected women The swine flu epidemic in Norway had its peak in we eks 45-46 (November 2009). Perhaps 20-30 % of pregnant women were infected at this time, and it can be estimated that at least 50 % of women were vaccinated during the last three months of 2009. Vaccination was only recommended in the last two trimesters of pregnancy , however. In many countries it is difficult to collect popula tion based data for pregnant women and their children. Norway has an established system for regi stration of births and birth outcomes through the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). In add ition, Norway has several other national registries, such as the surveillance system for inf ectious diseases (MSIS), the vaccination registry, now including vaccination against the H1N 1 pandemic variant (PANVAK/ SYSVAK), the Norwegian Prescription Database (NORPD), the Ca use of Death Registry and the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR). Infection, use of antiviral medication and vaccinat ion during pregnancy are not random processes. Therefore, associations between these ev ents and adverse outcomes in childhood are likely to be confounded by other conditions, lifest yles, other exposures and socioeconomic factors. Linkage of these registries alone (RegFlu) is important to detect some types of side effects of vaccination and long term effects of inf ection. However, the validity of the registry 5 information can be questioned, and the registries d o not contain sufficient amount of information on confounders. In addition, a number of outcomes such as language delay and cognitive abilities are non-existent in registries. By including a questionnaire (MoBaFlu) in a large o ngoing cohort study (The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study - MoBa), consisting o f 90,000 women, 70,000 men and their 107,000 children aged 1 to 10 years, a large amount of background information is available, and a long-term follow-up will be possible including th e outcomes mentioned above. MoBa will contain sufficient confounder information, but will be hampered by imprecise information on actual exposure to the infection. Faced with these shortcomings, a pregnancy cohort p roject (NorFlu), based on informed consent, where exposure can be more precisely defined throug h analysis of biological material and questionnaire responses, and where children can be followed with precise research questions, is needed. The knowledge gained may be of substantial value for an international audience. Information from RegFlu, MoBaFlu and NorFlu will su pplement each other. Of specific interest in this situation is the exist ing infrastructure for MoBa that is available at th e Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) (www.fh i.no/morogbarn). We propose to use this infrastructure for NorFlu. We set forth the follow ing research questions related to the current influenza pandemic: Specific research questions Influenza A (H1N1) infection To estimate the risks of pregnancy complications su ch as premature birth and perinatal morbidity in infected as compared to non-infected w omen, To study long-term health effects in infants and ch ildren exposed to maternal influenza in fetal life To study differences in severity of influenza disea se in mothers and infants according to host factors (genes) and cofactors (other infection s, nutritional factors) Antiviral medication To study the effects of antiviral medication on pre valence and severity of maternal influenza, and respiratory disease in infants and c hildren To estimate the risks of pregnancy complications an d adverse birth outcomes after maternal use of antiviral medication To study long-term health effects in children after exposure to antiviral medication in utero Vaccine against Influenza A (H1N1) To estimate the proportion of pregnant women receiv ing vaccination against Influenza A (H1N1) in pregnancy To estimate the occurrence of Influenza A (N1H1) in pregnancy in vaccinated and non- vaccinated women 6 To estimate the risks of pregnancy complications an d adverse birth outcomes in vaccinated as compared to non-vaccinated women To estimate the occurrence of Influenza A (N1H1) in infants born to vaccinated and non- vaccinated women To study long-term health effects in infants and ch ildren after maternal vaccination against Influenza A (H1N1) in pregnancy To study long- term health effects in infants and c hildren after vaccination in childhood against Influenza A (H1N1) Design NorFlu is a pregnancy cohort study. Participation w ill be based on informed consent. The aim is to compare the incidence of disease/adverse outcome in a group of exposed women/children with a group that has not been exposed, while controllin g for other factors which can confound the associations. Many of the subprojects will be base d on the cohort design of the main project. When additional exposure data are required, or bloo d samples are being analyzed, the relevant design will be a nested case-control study. This in volves identifying a sample of subjects that have developed the disease, and selecting controls that have not developed the disease, and measuring exposures in already collected blood samp les for both groups. In addition, sub-cohorts with particular exposures can be followed in more d etail, for instance with respect to clinical testing for neuro-psychological abilities. Sample The period of invitation to the study will be March 1 st 2010 through August 2010. During this period, approximately 9000 pregnant women in Bergen and the Oslo area will be eligible for invitation to the study. If we assume a 50 % respon se rate, approximately 4500 women will participate. Appendix 1 shows the timelines of infl uenza exposure in pregnancy and expected time of birth. A sample of this size is sufficient for detecting a doubling of risk of reasonably common outcomes (that occur in at least 1 % of subj ects) since the exposures (infection, vaccination and medication) are relatively frequent (Appendix 2). Recruitment Pregnant women will be recruited to the study in pr egnancy week 27-35. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics ha s allowed the project access to names and addresses of pregnant women attending antenatal car e (the routine ultrasound examination) at Birth Clinics. Electronic or manual lists of pregna nt women will be transferred to the Data Collection Unit at the NIPH in Bergen. Eligible wom en will receive an invitation letter (Appendix 3) to the study prior to birth, starting March 1st 2010. Participation is based on informed consent. The wom en and their partners will be informed in writing of the voluntary nature of the project prio r to birth (information brochure including the statement of consent in Appendix 4), and of their r ight to withdraw from the project at any given time. They will also be informed that the main purp ose of the project is to study causes of disease, and for this cohort in particular to study the effects of exposure to influenza A (H1N1), vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) (in Norway Pandemrix , Glaxo- Smith-Kline) and use of antiviral drugs on pregnancy outcome, maternal and child health and mortality. By reading the 7 information and signing the consent form, participa nts also agree to linkage of collected data to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) and oth er health and exposure registries (see below), and allow access to other blood samples and microbiologic samples taken in pregnancy or after birth from the mother or the child (includ ing the routine screening blood samples for pregnant women, and the screening sample for phenyl ketonuria in the child (PKU)). For linkage to non-medical registries or to hospital records, s pecific allowances from the Regional Committee of Medical and Health Research Ethics mus t be applied for. They are also informed that a new informed consent must be collected from them if subprojects that include clinical examinations or blood samples are introduced. Assuming that the follow up period becomes extended, an informed consent must b e collected from the children when they are 16 years old. Data collection The data collection to this study will be almost id entical to that of the MoBa study (see www.fhi.no/morogbarn). Questionnaires The women will complete 2 questionnaires during pre gnancy and at intervals after birth (6, 18, 36 months, 5 and 7 years). The 2 questionnaires (ap pendix 5) are sent together with the letter of invitation, the information brochure and the statem ent of consent. In addition to background information on participating women, one of the preg nancy questionnaires will include information on health status and other exposures in pregnancy which may possibly alter the risk or severity of disease after exposure to the influe nza virus, the vaccine or the antiviral medication. The other questionnaire will directly concern exposure to Influenza A (H1N1) virus and vaccine (Pandemrix) and antiviral medication. Linkage to registries The data set will routinely be linked to the Medica l Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) for information on pregnancy outcome and neonatal condi tions. Also, linkage to the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR), which is administered by th e Norwegian Directorate of Health, will be performed on a regular basis. The NPR covers in-pat ient and out-patient hospital care. The registry covers mental health and somatic care, and includes activity and waiting lists. Data on the patient's age, sex and residence, hospital and department, diagnoses, medical and surgical procedures, dates of admission and discharge as wel l as date of procedure are included in the registry. Registry data will also provide informati on on exposures, for instance vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) (SYSVAK) or specific med ications (NORPD) that may influence the outcome of interest. Hospital records may also be requested for additional information and verification of diagnoses and treatment. Blood samples Blood samples will be collected from the mother aft er birth as well as from the umbilical cord. The blood sample from the mother consists of 35 ml in 6 vials. Three of these are dedicated to the isolation of cells, one is a Tempus tube for co llection of RNA, one is an EDTA tube for plasma and DNA extraction, while the last tube is f or collection of serum. From the umbilical cord, one Tempus tube and an EDTA tube is collected . The processing of these samples is explained in Appendix 6. 8 Linkage to MoBa data For women who already participate in MoBa, data fro m NorFlu and MoBa can be analyzed together. This will provide a unique opportunity to compare pregnancies exposed to influenza or vaccine with unexposed pregnancies. Other blood samples We will ask the participants' permission to (if nee ded) make use of blood samples that have been taken from mothers during pregnancy. Samples may ha ve been collected for routine screening purposes or for diagnostic purposes. These samples may then be used for specific purposes in the study, for instance virus detection or antibody mea surements in women who report having had influenza-symptoms in early pregnancy (prior to rec ruitment), or from the child in case of disease after birth. Data storage Person identifiable data (tracking system) Women who agree to participate are registered in a data base containing name, personal identification number, a code number which correspo nds to other files, information relating to when questionnaires or blood samples are sent and r eceived, and whether reminders have been sent. No other information is stored in this databa se. All information about the father and child will be linked to the woman, who is the index perso n in the project (see Appendix 6). Questionnaires Data files that contain information from the questi onnaires have code numbers. The code number, which is the same as the one in the person database, will only be used together with the national identification number in the event that li nks are to be made to other health registries or data is to be extracted for case-control studies. T he questionnaire databases will be stored and checked at NIPH in Bergen (see www.fhi.no/morogbarn for details on questionnaires, and Appendix 6). Research biobank All blood samples in the NorFlu data collection wil l be sent to the central facility in Oslo and processed there. The aliquoted plasma samples will be frozen at -85C and stored in freezers at the biobank (which also houses the MoBa blood sampl es) at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Extracted DNA will be stored at -25C. A sp ecially constructed data application will be used to locate the blood samples in the biobank (se e Appendix 7). Variables Health Variables A health variable is defined as one that describes or defines a health condition, either from the questionnaire, registry or blood sample. Normally t hese variables become effect variables in a cause-effect model, but they can also be exposure v ariables for other health variables. Many health variables will be collected from links to ot her health registries or as part of subprojects. We will in general collect the same variables that have been collected in MoBa, see www.fhi.no/morogbarn . For the extended purpose of NorFlu, the following variables have been added: 9 Exposure variables 1. Reported exposure (questionnaire) a. Influenza A (H1N1) b. Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine c. Antiviral medication 2. Biological exposure a. Influenza A (H1N1) confirmed by virus detection me thods (MSIS) b. Antibodies against Influenza A (H1N1) in non-vacci nated persons (serology) (MSIS) c. Genotypes associated with severe disease outcomes o r varying effects of vaccines or medications 3. Registerbased exposures a. Vaccination against Influenza A (H1N1) as reported to SYSVAK i. Immunological response b. Antiviral medication as recorded in NORPD Outcome variables The main endpoints to be studied are 1. Influenza A (H1N1) infection (MSIS) 2. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (MBRN) 3. Maternal health outcomes (questionnaires, NPR, MBRN , Cause of Death Registry) 4. Health outcomes in newborn, infants and children (MBRN, NPR, Cause of Death Registry) such as a. Congenital malformations b. Chronic diseases c. Developmental disorders d. Susceptibility to infections or autoimmune diseases in childhood However, a large number of other specific research questions may also be addressed. Confounders and effect-modifiers A number of potential confounders and effect-modifi ers may be collected from the questionnaires and from links to other health regis tries, such as 1. Preexisting diseases 2. Factors related to the pregnancy 3. Factors related to the perinatal period 4. Socioeconomic factors 5. Lifestyle factors 6. Genetic factors Other variables The questionnaires also include a number of other v ariables that are not exposure or health variables. Some of these will be used to correct fo r potential confounding, while others may be modifiers of effects. Project organization This project is a collaboration between NIPH (speci fically the Division of Epidemiology, the Division of Mental Health and the Division of Infec tious Disease Control), The South-Eastern 10 Regional Health Authority and The Western Regional Health Authority. The collaboration is regulated by a contract. A steering group with memb ers from all three parties is being set up. A management group at the NIPH runs the data-collecti on procedures. The project leader is Per Magnus, who is head of the Division of Epidemiology . A group of researchers is being set up with members from NIPH and the Health Authorities t o stimulate research. Subprojects must be specified with precise research questions using the same principles as for MoBa (see guidelines for access to data in www.fhi.no/morogbarn ). Researchers at the Health Authorities or NIPH wi ll not have to pay for data deliveries. International collaboration There is an already established network of internat ional researchers and collaborating groups at NIPH, and this study is of interest for several ins titutions in the USA. Collaborators will come from several institutions. So far, there is an inte rest from Rachel Miller at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York who is submit ting a pilot proposal to the NIH entitled: \"Prenatal influenza vaccination, fetal immunologica l and epigenetic responses, and clinical efficacy in children\" Also, Stephanie London at the Epidemiology branch of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences has exp ressed an interest in collaborating closely in this study. Collaborators within other European cou ntries, and in particular the Nordic countries is also warranted. This study may provide answers t o questions important to the world community, and we believe it will be of great inter est to international collaborators since most countries lack the infrastructure to set up similar studies. Funding Funding is being sought from the Ministry of Health , the Norwegian Research Council as well as from the funding agencies abroad. Ethical considerations The project involves collecting sensitive personal information. Much effort has already been, and will continue to be, expended on ensuring that thir d parties cannot link data from the project to a specific name. We require participants to state nam e, address and personal identification number for two reasons. Firstly, so we can communicate wit h participants during data collection and secondly, so we can link data to external data sour ces, such as hospital records. Data from the questionnaires and blood samples will be stored wit h a linkable code number. The code number and personal identification number will only be lin ked when required in the course of data collection, and later when links to other databases are made. All the data made available to researchers (internal and external) will be persona l health data from which the name, personal identity number and other characteristics serving t o identify a person have been removed, so that the data can no longer be linked to a natural perso n. In other words, identification will be possible using the code number, but not directly to the person who has provided that information. As a general rule, the results from analyses of blo od samples will be transferred back to the central database so that others can utilize them, b ut this can be evaluated in each individual case. The consent form, the information letter and the in formation brochure will give details regarding the scope of the study and consequences of particip ation. Later, newsletters and dedicated web pages will keep participants informed. Children wil l be informed personally about the study when they are 15 years. They will be asked to give consent to continue in the study when they are 18. 11 While rights and obligations have not been negotiat ed, the consent form in many ways resembles a contract, whereby participants agree to donate bi ological material and information about themselves. In exchange a guarantee is given that t he researchers will use the material to study the causes of disease. This involves a fundamental trust on the part of the participants; it will be unethical on the part of the researchers not to uti lize the material in the manner intended, or to use it for other purposes. New subprojects, which r equire active participation (completion of new questionnaires, clinical investigations, evaluation of exposure or new biological samples) beyond what is explicitly stated in the signed consent for m, will require new consent. Participants on subprojects must also give permission that data wil l be channeled into the main project. Researcher's access to data Researchers can apply for access to data. Any deliv ery of data will be considered as a sub-project of NorFlu. For each sub-project, a contract will be written between the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the researcher. All sub-projects who use NorFlu data need a defined scientific manager or institution responsible for the legal ob ligations. All sub-projects must also have a principal investigator with scientific responsibili ty for the project. A contract gives the right to study one or more hypothesis for a defined limited period of time. Identifiable NorFlu data can only be submitted to institutes outside the EU/EEA after signing Safe Harbour agreement or other equivalent documents. Researchers of each sub -project are responsible for acquiring all necessary licenses, such as license from the Region al Committee for Medical Research Ethics (REK). Transfer of new data into the main database If a sub-project requires data not foreseen in the main protocol new informed consent should be obtained from the participants. The consent should also include access to transfer new data into the main database. Transferring of data form sub-projects to the main database will be done in agreement with the research institute and after the completion of the sub-project. Results from analyses of blood- and urine-samples f rom the sub-projects will also be transferred to the main database for other projects to utilize them. Project value The main purpose of the project is to investigate t he effects of influenza, vaccines and antiviral medication on pregnancy outcome and health for moth er and child by collecting a broad array of exposures and health outcomes. The present state of knowledge on the effects of the pandemic is limited and we believe that NorFlu will make an imp ortant international contribution. More knowledge may lead to effective interventions and p reventive measures, reveal mechanisms that influence disease processes and lead to new treatme nt forms. It is also important to disprove false theories regarding the cause and consequences of disease and investigate factors associated with good health and absence of disease- both in a short term and a long term perspective. Potential Harm No interventions will be undertaken in connection w ith the project, in the sense that conditions resulting in an exposure will not be wittingly modi fied in order to prevent disease. Participants will not receive the results of blood tests, or oth er information about themselves, that they are not already aware of. However, they can have full acces s to all information about themselves if 12 required. Should new therapeutic interventions beco me available that may help subjects who are in need of such treatment, special obligations may arise, that will be negotiated with the regional ethics committee before any decisions are made. Par ticipants can be recruited to new sub- projects on the basis of disease information or pre gnancy outcomes about which they are already informed (e.g. congenital abnormalities) or based o n geographical location, child's date of birth etc. Conflicts of interest between researchers The study is a national resource that will be avail able to all bona fide researchers with a legitimate request for data. If different research groups have similar study aims and wish to use the same data, then flexibility will be encouraged and collaboration sought. The leader group's decision will be final in such matters. Dissemination of results Publications will be made according to further guid elines. Norwegian public health risk evaluations and advice will be given according to t he existent guidelines. Approval by The Regional Committee for Medicine and Health Research Ethics (REK) In November 2009, approval was sought from REK, and was granted 22.12.2009 (Appendix 8).

Epub 2009 Jul 22 F\u00f8dsler fra 1 mars - 24 september (n=8400) Med 50% oppslutning - 4000 deltagere Sp\u00f8rreskjema ca uke 27 (hos mdnr etter dette tidsrom 15 Appendix 2 Power calculations Calculations are based on a sample size of 4000 inc luded women and their offspring. We assume that around 50% of pregnant women will be vaccinated against H1N1, and that around 10% of vaccinated women will have had H1N1, and around 30% of unvaccinated pregnant women will have had H1N1. These estimates result in around 20% of all participants to have had H1N1. Effects of H1N1 influenza on outcomes in women and children Outcomes could be either pregnancy or birth related or later health outcomes in children. Examples are outcomes with prevalence of 5% or 1%. Example 1: Effect of influenza exposure during pregnancy on A DHD in children. The prevalence of ADHD is around 5%. With 4 000 pa rticipants we will be able to find an association with a relative risk of RR 1.60, 95% CI (1.06 , 2.43) for ADHD if exposed to H1N1 in pregnancy. Example 2 : Effect of influenza exposure during pregnancy on risk of schizophrenia The prevalence of schizophrenia is about 1 %. With 4000 participants we will be able to detect an association with a RR of 2.77 or above (95 % CI: 1.02 -7.54). 16 Appendix 3 Letter of invitation Bergen, 20. oktober 2011 Foresp\u00f8rsel om deltakelse i Den norske du ikke lenger er gravid, er i lei for at du har f\u00e5tt denne henvendelsen og ber deg se jorid.eide@fhi.no Per Magnus Prosjektleder, professor dr.med. per.magnus@fhi.no 17 Appendix 4 Information Brochure 18 19 Appendix 5 Questionnaire 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Appendix 6 Tracking system The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study uses an advanced database (tracking system) to register and follow the progress of participants th rough the various phases of the study. Oracle 7.3 has been used to create and access the database , and the screen formats have been developed using Oracle Forms 5.0 and Oracle Reports 3.0. The computers, in which the tracking system is installed, are connected to the local network at th e Medical Birth Registry. To ensure the security of the database, MBRN's standard password system is used. The main menu of the tracking system shows the most important tasks in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The description in this app endix follows these tasks. All the tasks are important, but screen layouts are not shown. The unit that is followed by the tracking system is the pregnancy , not the woman. This is because a woman can participate in the project during sever al pregnancies. Registration of new ultrasound appointments A list of all women receiving ultrasound appointmen ts is compiled at each hospital. These lists are transferred to the person database at MBRN eith er manually or in encrypted electronic form. Electronic transfer is direct, while paper lists ar e keyed in manually. If a woman is already registered in the system, the information will be u pdated. Data relating to pregnancies being registered for the first time are entered. This inf ormation includes name, address, date, and where the ultrasound will be carried out. If a woman is a lready registered, either for this or a previous pregnancy, notification will automatically appear o n the screen and the date for the new ultrasound can be checked. A pregnancy being regist ered for the first time in the tracking system is given the status INNREG (Registered). The only information about the pregnancy at this s tage is the actual registration. Mailings, reminders and returned forms The return date for each kind of questionnaire is e ntered in the tracking system. Consent form reminders (last line, table 1) are only sent to wom en from whom samples, or one or more completed questionnaires, have been received. Questionnaires that have been returned are scanned and interpreted by a high capacity Fujitsu scanner and the program Eyes and Hands in Windows N T. This program reads marked and numbered fields and also allows the operator to man ually enter data that the program finds difficult to interpret. The questionnaires are scan ned and stored as optical images, which are then displayed on the screen as they are read by the pro gram. This allows the operator to add or modify codes when necessary. Each scanned questionn aire is allocated a code consisting of a pregnancy identification number and a number indica ting the type of questionnaire. These code numbers are transferred to the person database to k eep track of the questionnaires that have been scanned. Returned consent forms The consent form is an important item in the tracki ng system. When returned, the consent date is noted and the pregnancy is given the status DELTAKE R (participant). Only pregnancies that 35 have been allocated this status are considered to b e part of the study, and will be followed up with further questionnaire mailings. Change of status It is apparent from the description so far, that th e status of the pregnancy is decisive in allowing progress through the tracking system. As soon as a pregnancy is registered, it is given the status INNREG (registered). Thereafter, and for as long as it remains in the system, it will always have a status. The different types of status are shown i n table 2. When a woman, the Biobank or a hospital contacts the project indicating that the s tatus of a pregnancy should be changed, a special command is used. Appendix table 1 Overview of events which alter status in the track ing system Status Event resulting in change of status INNREG (rgistered) The pregnancy is registered in the tracking system. INVITERT (invited) First mailing to the expectant mother with status I NNREG is sent out. DELTAKER (participant) Consent form returned. ABORTERT (abortion) Notification of abortion either from the woman hers elf or the hospital. UTMELDT (withdrawn) Notification of withdrawal from the study. VIL SLETTES (wants to be deleted) Notification of withdrawal and that all data is to be deleted. D\u00d8DF\u00d8DSEL(s tillbirth) Notification that the baby died (after 16th week) f rom MBR or woman herself. Deleting a pregnancy A pregnancy can be deleted if a woman having first agreed to participate and later wishes to withdraw and have all the data concerning her pregn ancy deleted. The resulting status is VIL SLETTES (to be deleted), and the Biobank is request ed to delete blood-and urine samples. Data already registered from questionnaires can also be deleted from the main data files. However, data that have been made anonymous and already give n to researchers cannot be deleted. On receipt of an acknowledgement from the Biobank t hat blood- and urine samples have been deleted, the pregnancy is again called up and the d ate for deletion of the blood sample entered. The status of the pregnancy is then automatically r egistered as SLETTET (deleted). At this 36 stage, the only information remaining in the system is that an unidentified pregnancy has been registered. Data from the Biobank Once a week, a computer generated encrypted list of newly registered blood samples is sent to the project from the Biobank. Data from this list a re entered into the tracking system. This enables consent form reminders to be sent and compi lations of pregnancies with complete sets of blood-and urine samples to be made. Linking data from MBR and DSP Before questionnaires are sent out, data from the N IPH, MBR and National census data (DSP) are linked to the tracking system. This is to confi rm the date of birth and ensure that the questionnaires are only sent to women with live chi ldren. In addition, information about multiple births (twins, triplets) enables an appropriate num ber of questionnaires to be sent. 37 Appendix 7 Biobank description Established in 1999, the Biobank at the Norwegian I nstitute of Public Health has grown to become a state-of-the-art unit for long-term storag e and processing of valuable biological samples used in national and international research . The Biobank is responsible for all biological specimens collected through the Norwegian Mother an d Child Cohort Study (MoBa), and the same system will apply to NorFlu. The Biobank has three main focus areas in regard to the NorFlu study: 1. Sample handling, processing and long-term storing o f the collected biological specimens for current and future use. 2. Quality assurance and quality control of the banked biological samples by implement evaluative procedures for determination of sample q uality with respect to specific uses. 3. Retrieval of requested biological material to natio nal and international researchers for specific analyses. The collection of samples had been described in det ails in MoBa study protocol 1 (ref). In brief, EDTA whole blood samples were collected from both p arents during pregnancy, from the child's umbilical cord right after birth, and from the moth er post-partum. From all samples, DNA has been extracted and plasma separated. From the child , umbilical cord blood has been collected in TEMPUS blood tubes for RNA extraction and gene expr ession studies. The RNA collection were initiated in 2005, and are available for appro ximately 52 000 children included in the cohort. A urine sample is also collected from the m other during pregnancy (prenatal). DNA, RNA, whole blood, plasma and urine are aliquoted an d stored at -20\u00baC and -80 \u00baC, respectively. In addition, collection of milk teeth from all chil dren at 6 years of age is performed. The blood samples available in MoBa are thus suitable for gen etic analysis, transcript profiling, biomarker analyses and toxicology analyses. A milk tooth is c ollected from all the children at 6 years of age. Among present large established prospective birth c ohorts, the NorFlu like the MoBa study is unique in several aspects regarding research option s. The collection of data and biological specimens in NorFlu starts during pregnancy, and no t at birth, as for most other child cohort studies, which give excellent opportunities to stud y prenatal exposures. NorFlu and MoBa are also the only cohort studies collecting blood sampl es for RNA extraction and gene expression studies. Whole blood samples in TEMPUS blood RNA tu bes will be collected. In addition, whole blood samples, and thus extracted DNA, from t he fathers are also available, which gives the opportunity for genetic studies including mothe r, father and child (triade design). Link to central health registries in Norway is possible due to every citizen in Norway are given a unique identification number at birth. Registry data from The Medical Birth Registry in Norway (MBRN) is included in the MoBa study. Sample handling and storage of biological material in NorFlu and MoBa. The sample handling and processing of biological ma terial from the consented participants in the MoBa study are described in detail in the MoBa Stud y Protocol 1 (www.fhi.no/morogbarn) and 38 in R\u00f8nningen et al. (2006), an identical approach w ill be used in NorFlu. In brief, the collection of MoBa samples were performed at hospitals where s ubjects were recruited, and shipped to the MoBa biobank overnight in packing materials provide d to the hospitals by NIPH. Most samples were received the day after collection. However, bl ood samples collected before weekends, where store up to two days at + 4\u00b0C prior to transp ortation to the Biobank. The transport of blood samples from the hospitals to the repository was performed by regular mail at ambient temperature due to seasonal changes in Norway. The specimens may therefore been subject to elevated temperatures for variable intervals before banking in the repository. All biological specimens collected in the MoBa stud y were registered into a secure in-house data-management system, on arrival, and barcode lab elling used on all samples and storage equipment. The processing and storage of the specim ens took place upon arrival at the Biobank. Isolation and storage of DNA, however, were isolate d from whole blood samples within a maximum delay of up to 5 days. All aliquoted sample s were thus stored within specified time limits to ensure quality. In addition to standard o peration protocols in sample handling, barcode labelling ensures the security and traceability of all samples stored in the Biobank. Aliquoted samples are assigned to freezers with opt imal storage temperature for the kind of sample in question. Backup freezers are available i n case of freezer failure. Continuous temperature monitoring is in operation, and duplica tes of material from the same individual are stored in separate freezers for security purposes. The storage location of freezers is defined by location on plate, plate number, rack number, and f reezer number. This information is saved in the Biobanks tracking database. New data collection in regard to collection of addi tional biological material from the participants when the children grow up will be considered if sci entifically meaningful and due to financial issues. Rational for sample collection methods In brief, EDTA tubes are standard for DNA and plasm a collections. TEMPUS blood RNA tubes were chosen for RNA collection based on a pilot stu dy with 9 donors where TEMPUS and PAXGene systems where compared for RNA quantity and quality, and costs. Performance was similar for the two systems. RNA integrity was comp arables, as judge by 28S and 18S rRNA imaging and real-time PCR measurements of several h ousekeeping genes.RNA will be available to researchers in near future. Quality Assurance in the Biobank The Biobank has well-established routines and back- up facilities to ensure the safe storage and processing of biological samples and is aiming for ISO 9001 certification in 2010. All equipment is regularly maintained for optimal performance. The following measures have been implemented to red uce the risk of damage to the stored material: Sample processing and handling are expedited by usi ng computerised/robotic systems All laboratory procedures has been performed by sta ndard operational procedures (SOPs) Freezers has back-up generators and alarm systems f ro temperature monitoring 39 Samples from each individual are split and stored i n separate freezer units. QA/QC on the banked specimens To safeguard the biological material to be collecte d collected in the NorFlu study with high standards of quality is of outmost importance. Stor age of NorFlu biological specimens banked to be used for current and as yet undetermined hypothe sis raises issues concerning the samples integrity. The repository has a quality control pro gram, as well as ongoing QA/QC projects to document the quality of the biological specimens. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from both a dults (parents) and whole blood obtained from the umbilical cord using commercially available products. The extracted DNA was tested for quality control on a routine basis f or e.g. DNA concentration, purity, PCR success rate and fragmentation. DNA samples from each parti cipant was normalized to an approximately concentration of 100 ng/\u00b5l using automated processe s by robotics before it is stored in aliquots on 96 wells microtitre plates at -20\u00b0C. However, th e Biobank are currently working on making some of the available DNA from each individual at a concentration of 25 ng/\u00b5l. This will result in minimizing delivery of unnecessary DNA to resear chers, and thus maximizing the use of the material collected. Analysis of a selection of biomarkers after freeze- thaw cycles have been conducted at the MoBa Biobank. Results indicated that most of the tested biomarkers remain stable in plasma after 30 freeze-thaw cycles (Paltiel et al., 2008). Informat ion about the stability of analytes may inform choices of samples for specific analyses. To avoid unnecessary freeze thaw cycles, the regular MoBa plasma samples will be moved from 96 wells mic ro titer plates onto single tubes on Matrix plates, equal to the environmental plasma sa mples. Planning of this process is in progress. The process will involve thawing the samples before transfer to single tubes prior to freezing. This change will result in a marked improvement in quality of the banked plasma samples will be achieved. Umbilical cord blood from the child has been collec ted in TEMPUS blood RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems) for later RNA extraction and gene expre ssion studies. For quality control the biobank compare the quality and stability between l ong-term stored umbilical cord blood collected on RNA TEMPUS tubes and long-term stored extracted RNA. These studies are ongoing on a regular basis, and the result will be published in scientific journals. The RNA specimens will be available to research projects in near future. 40 Retrieval of requested biological specimens to researchers The interest to use the biological material for res earch purposes to test specific hypothesis is increasing. As opposed to data from questionnaires which can be reused, biological material is a limited resource. Retrieval of biological material to researchers that apply for access is ongoing, and is done both manual and automated by robotics. In 2009, the Biobank was equipped with two additional robots for withdrawal of biological specimens. Retrieval is accomplished using partially automated equipment for all samples store d in 96 well formats. Samples are transferred to a pipetting robot that automatically retrieves a nd transfers samples to a delivery plate. Other retrievals are made manually using computerized sup port. After the request is filled, remaining materials are returned to long-term storage. The en tire process is tracked in the tracking database, creating up-to date inventory. The Biobank was recently awarded governmental fundi ng for an automated -20\u00b0C storage freezer system for picking of requested samples. Th is automated storage and retrieval system will be in place when moving to the new facilities, estimated in 2010. This will increase the speed and capacity of retrieval of requested sample s to researcher, as well as quality assurance aspects. To avoid emptying the biobank of biological specime n from the participants due to future scientific needs, a minimum amount of plasma, DNA, and whole blood should be kept from each participant, both adults and children. In addition, some biological samples (urine and whole blood samples for environmental analyses, RNA) are collected through international cooperation, and therefore special access rules exi st. . A price strategy for access to biological material will be established. New locations for the Biobank and regional cooperat ion In 2010, the Biobank will be relocated to new purpo se-built premises due to expansion. Further, the Biobank will extend its services to also includ e processing and storage facilities to other institutes and companies who need these kinds of se rvices. In addition, the Biobank take part in a regional co-operation with similar actors in the Os lo area. A more detailed description of Biobank conducted by The Norwegian Institute of Pub lic Health is available at our website (www.fhi.no/artikler?id=75022 ).
