Driven by a spirit of innovation, we rose to meet the challenges and demands of our ever-evolving environment. Whether through adjustments of work processes, or by effecting major change in testingmethods from our scientific research, we were constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to runour business, advance our science-based agenda, and exceed the expectations of our stakeholders. HSA continually strives to safeguard public health and has implemented plans and strategies in support of this. We do this with a strong mission-oriented mindset, conscious of the critical role we play in strengthening Singapore's reputation as a leading medical hub and centre of biomedical excellence. We directed efforts towards strengthening ties and partnerships with parties and agencies in the public, private and people sectors, both locally and overseas. These collaborative alliances continue to provide uswith a greater capacity to develop more creative and practical solutions to deal with global and localmatters in the health sciences. Through fresh approaches in our business operations and new communication channels, we redoubled our efforts to engage our customers and improve the experience of individuals and organisations interactingwith HSA staff. There was a palpable sense of excitement as we grew in new ways. We had the privilege of sharing our expertise, experiences and successes with various audiences around the world and who were keen to learnabout our experiences. Such opportunities allow us to influence national and global public health and safety in a positive and sustainable manner.HSA Annual Report 2008-09 09Our distinctive blend of professional expertise and know-how presents unique possibilities to explore innovation in our regulatory and laboratory arenas. We continued to harness synergy within and acrossour organisation which helped us deliver on our key accountabilities more competently and efficiently. Our Applied Sciences Group expanded the accredited screening list for western drug adulterants in herbal medicines, as well as applied conventional and novel forensic techniques to enhance our Health ProductsRegulation Group's enforcement capabilities and advance our fight against illegal and counterfeit drugs.Drawing on this in-house expertise across a broad spectrum of scientific fields will not just strengthen theunified identity of HSA, but will empower us to forge fresh momentum to continually transform ourselvesand actively shape our future. As a science-based and science-led organisation, our decisions and actions are always guided by the highest standards of professional integrity and scientific rigour. This is strongly linked to our aim to inspire trust and confidence in meeting the needs of our stakeholders and finding solutions for critical issues that we deal with, regardless of how complex these may be. We have much going for us, in spite of being a relatively young organisation. We have many good reasons to be optimistic about our future, and these give us the added impetus to grow and advance. Bolsteredby the professionalism and passion of the HSA team, this outlook is founded on the underlying strengthsof the firm scientific foundations and legacy on which our organisation is built, the tremendous potentialof synergistic collaborations within the agency, the power of partnerships with our key counterparts locallyand globally, and the promise of new breakthroughs in our research and scientific and organisationalcollaborations. I would like to commend and thank the leadership and staff of HSA for another year of sterling work and dedication in enabling our agency to move decisively forward in serving the nation and the world. Professor Edison Liu Chairman HSA Annual Report 2008-09 XX CEO's Preface HSA Annual Report 2008-09 10HSA Annual Report 2008-09 11HSA Annual Report 2008-09 12 HSA continued to make good progress over the past year in a dynamic operating environment. Through the strong commitment of the HSA team, we became a SingaporeQuality Class organisation this year and were also re-certified for the People Developer and Singapore Innovation Class standards. This affirmed that our key organisational systems, processes and initiatives are robust and responsive for our journey ahead.We continued to strongly emphasize our Core Values and living these out to grow the responsible, innovative culture rightfully associated with a national scientific andregulatory authority. We completed a holistic review of our human capital framework that simplified and streamlined our schemes of service. From this, we rolled out a new performanceappraisal framework to enable clearer target setting, enhanced transparency in performance assessment, and more fruitful interactions between supervisors and staff. The establishment of a HSA Professional Board, the introduction of a clearprofessional staff track, and the ongoing review of our talent development framework will serve to empower and grow all members of the HSA family as they contributeand achieve their potential. We also refreshed the connections between our business decisions and various social and environmental concerns through a new corporate social responsibility framework. Our Corporate Headquarters was restructured to ensure better coordination in order to provide clear directions and support to better harness the synergies of our professional groups. Our strategic planning process and service quality initiatives continue to beenhanced, and we are looking into strengthening our risk management and process management systems. At our Health Products Regulation Group, we continued with the rollout of the Health Products Act, particularly the requirements in the medical devices and cosmetics regulatory frameworks. This was balanced by initiatives to minimise unnecessaryregulatory costs and administrative process. Listening to our stakeholders, responding to their concerns promptly, and refining our regulatory policies and frameworks accordingly were accorded high priority to strengthen our pro-enterprise orientation.We made several improvements to our work processes by introducing more efficient ways of working, while promoting integrity, responsibility and transparency in our public health protection mission.Our Blood Services Group spared no effort in making sure that a safe and stable supply of whole blood and blood products is available toevery patient in need. We achieved accreditation to the most stringent current international safety and quality standards for tissue typing and transplant support activities. We pressed on in developingprocedures and practices to promote blood conservation and ensure we remain a premier blood bank and critical national resource. Asan active member of the international community, we also made many useful contributions in blood banking and transfusion medicine through participation in global forums and providing consultancy advice to other standard-setting bodies. We also continued toadvance on the pioneering research and service front. With the success of our pilot Cell Processing Laboratory, we are now expanding our facilities to undertake more collaborative projects with clinicalcolleagues, applying cells such as natural killer cells and haematopoietic stem cells for therapeutic use. Stability, reliability, consistency and quality were what the laboratories at our Applied Sciences Group continued to offer to all our clients. This was made possible with a proven track record founded on sound scientificexpertise and strong synergy amongst the various scientific disciplines across our laboratories. With our strong orientation towards creating more value-add for our customers, we developed a host of innovativeproducts and testing methods in-house that will offer our customers faster turnaround times and renewed assurance in the quality of our services. We also look forward to the opening of our new ChemicalMetrology Laboratory, currently being purpose-built in a cleanroom environment, in August 2009. This will add another new capability and dimension to our growing pool of expertise in the applied sciences. A vibrant and productive research environment in our areas of scientific expertise will be a vital catalyst for the expansion of ourcurrent work scope and open up new areas of innovation and excellence. We are excited by new developments already shaping up in promising fields such as pharmacogenomics and cellular therapy,and seeing ideas and hypotheses being transformed into powerful, practical solutions to improve the quality of healthcare. This will enable an even stronger and more concrete expression of our missionimperatives.Our ongoing ability to form new alliances will significantly add breadth and scale to our capabilities. These partnerships, particularlythrough worksharing collaborations with our international counterparts, give us the opportunity to share our unique perspectives and develop thought leadership as a valued global partner in healthsciences. Having hosted the 3 rd Summit of Heads of Medicines Regulatory Agencies in December last year, we now look forward toco-hosting the 14 th International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities with the World Health Organisation, in September 2010. Much of what you will read in the following pages reflect the successful partnerships we have with our parent Ministry, our Board and our partners in Government, industry and overseas counterpart agencies. We thank them for their collaboration and counsel whichnot only have energised us but enabled us to function more effectively. The future is uncertain but also exciting and full of opportunity. We choose to set our sights on the limitless possibilities, building our stakeholders' trust and confidence in what HSA has already accomplished and the potential and promise it holds. This will galvanise our thinkingand actions throughout our organisation, and be the impetus for us to press on towards achieving our goals and mission in a transformational manner.

This move marks the completion of an organisational review initiated since 2007 to enhance greater synergies and collaboration of our professional groups and CorporateHQ, and across HSA as a whole. With the restructuring, the professional centres were removed and are now reorganised as functional divisions comprising branches/units/laboratories under the three consolidated professional groups: the Health Products Regulation Group, Blood Services Group(previously known as the Health Services Group and renamed to more accurately reflect its functions as the national blood service), and the Applied Sciences Group. The Corporate HQ structure was streamlined in January 2009 for tighter operational effectiveness to enhance its value in definingstrategic direction and providing corporate support for the organisation and its three professional groups. The Strategic Planning, Operations and Communications Division was formed to better rationalise the functions across the Operations and Strategy Department, and Planning and Development Department, and also to incorporate the organisation's Corporate Communicationscapabilities. The Human Capital and Legal Division was formed to reflect the emphasis in people development and capacity-building, as well as Organisational Development, to help drive HSA's strategic direction and objectives. A restructuring of the roles and functions of the Quality Management Office was effected. This enables a more holistic approach tomanaging customer feedback and interfaces feedback, and driving overall service outcomes to achieve organisational excellence. In order to enhance HSA's health and safe workplace initiatives, aWorkplace Health and Safety Department was also established. A Winning Workplace and Workforce Following an integrated assessment by SPRING Singapore in mid- March 2009, HSA was awarded the Singapore Quality Class (SQC). We also received renewals of the People Developer (PD) and SingaporeInnovation Class (I-Class) awards. The conferment of these awards is a major milestone for HSA. This validates our efforts in enhancing overall organisational excellence and promoting innovation as a key driver to improving work processes and customer responsiveness. Through the PD award, we are alsoheartened to receive recognition for putting a priority in creatingan environment for our staff to grow and make the most of their talents and careers. These awards will be invaluable as we gear up and benchmark ourselves for even better performance going forward. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 26Corporate Headquarters Our Corporate Headquarters (HQ) draws together the scientific perspectives and expertise from our three professional groups, and provides both leadership and administrative support to drive these in sync with the strategic directions charted for the organisation. It is the effective coordination and drawing together of the diverse skill sets and ideas across our organisation that will determine how successfully we can meet our national and global commitments today, and provide us the impetus to expand our public health responsibilities and provide thought leadership for tomorrow.Inspired by Innovation We continued to strengthen the innovation culture andencourage the contribution of innovative ideas to drive valuecreation within the organisation. This was especially evident through the ramping up of our research initiatives to advance innovation and thoughtleadership in diverse areas. Our aim is for our research tocontribute to best practices within the global forensic, scientificand biomedical communities, and also serve to advancescientific boundaries and human health. Key projects in the line-up will focus on developing innovative regulatory practices, building new scientific and forensic capabilities, and exploring new technologies in blood safety and quality. We signed aMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Healthcare Group's Domain Specific Review Board to provideus with additional insights as an independent ethics evaluatorfor our research projects. This MOU will help to facilitateHSA's efforts to continue conducting biomedical researchactivities in a transparent and stringent manner in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Several cross-functional project groups and taskforces were also created to generate high value ideas that are directlylinked to key corporate objectives. Mechanisms and recognitionsystems for staff members to contribute suggestions werealso reviewed. The improvements done were to make it easier for staff to encourage the generation of quality ideas. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 27Capabilities Augmented by Technology The year saw HSA further leveraging on and optimising our IT resourcesto accelerate our responses to new business opportunities and delivermore effectively on our core responsibilities. By integrating and expandingour applications and systems, we significantly improved our operatingefficiencies and attained better customer service delivery standards. Several key business-friendly improvements were made to our licensing system, PRISM, to provide us with even greater bandwidth to respond promptly to the regulatory and licensing needs of businesses. Theenhanced system now allows companies to transact with us electronically for online applications and amendments, automatic renewal of licences and progressive payments. We will continue to fine-tune PRISM so asto further rationalise our existing work processes and improve our customers' experience in this core area of our regulatory business. The FIONA (Forensic Integrated Operations Network Applications) system came into full swing at the Mortuary@HSA. With real-time data capturing at source now possible, work processes at the Mortuary@HSA havebeen further streamlined and expedited. At our Applied Sciences Laboratories, work efficiency and service levels to our clients moved up several notches with the implementation of the LISA (Laboratory Integrated Scientific Administration) system. With LISA, all laboratory processes are now fully automated end-to-end and clientscan also receive email or SMS notifications when their reports are ready for collection. We have also brought the benefits of the Internet to our blood donors in more ways through the DonorCare system - they now have a time- saving option to fill in their health questionnaires online before visitingthe Bloodbank@HSA for their donations. The HSA-wide KEN (Knowledge Enterprise Network) was officially launched during the year. Apart from being a rich repository of informationto promote good knowledge management and sharing practices, its newmedia tools such as forums and blogs create an interactive platform forstaff to share tips and information on work-related and recreational issues. This in turn helps to enhance the innovation climate for cross learning and sharing. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 28 We are also gearing up for the full rollout of CREST (Collaborating [for a] Reliable, Efficient, Shared System, Together) in the laterpart of 2009. Jointly developed by HSA with our four partneragencies, the Health Promotion Board, Media Development Authority,National Library Board and SPRING Singapore, CREST will enablegreater integration of information to facilitate faster and better-informed decision making to enhance our human resources, financeand administration functions. This effort to develop a sharedsystem will allow all CREST agencies to enjoy greater economiesof scale. Moving ahead, a key priority will be implementing several key initiatives under our new IT Master Plan that will significantlysharpen our capabilities in our regulatory mission. This includes the development of a new real-time system that monitors the blood inventories of hospitals and a Unique Health ProductsIdentifier (UHPI) system that aims to develop unique codes that will be used at the national level to identify specific drugs and medical devices in the healthcare cluster. Our overall IT infrastructurewill also be revamped to include new equipment and greener technology. Delighting our Customers Various structured platforms were introduced to better engage with our customers and industry partners. These include regularmeetings between clients and industry associations and the HSA management to gather inputs and to better understand their concerns. Through these interactions, we are better able to ensurethat our practices and polices are parallel to changing business needs and are also market sensitive. A Customer Satisfaction Survey was commissioned in mid 2008 to understand how we can better respond to our customers and also improve our service delivery standards. Further enhancementswere made on the curriculum of the service quality training for staff to equip them with the relevant skills required in managingcustomer interfaces and to deliver good customer service. Twoin-house awards were launched to recognise staff for their servicedelivery and to identify role models of excellent service to inspire others.Putting the Public at the Forefront We remained committed to providing clear, timely and authoritative information to the public on safety issues related to health products through media releases, alerts and advisories. By creating a heightenedpublic awareness and deeper appreciation of HSA's roles and responsibilities as a regulator in an increasingly complex environment, we continued to strengthen relationships with the media andcommunity by reinforcing the importance of the need for the public to be our co-partners in protecting public health. A new segment within our corporate website was developed specially with consumers in mind. This project is a significant step forward in our outreach efforts to empower consumers with information onthe responsible use of health products. It features write-ups on HSA's responsibilities such as our regulatory philosophy and what this means for consumers in layman language, and also contains usefulguides presenting consumer-friendly safety tips on reducing the risks associated with products ranging from cosmetics to prescription medicine. The segment also houses a microsite on informationrelated to illegal health products and advice on the steps the public can take to protect themselves and their loved ones. Apart from enjoying positive media coverage through various prominent feature stories profiling our key role as a champion forpublic health and safety in the major dailies, the intriguing workand outstanding capabilities of our forensic medicine and forensicscience teams were also featured in an exclusive episode of Unexpected Access, a highly popular prime time Mediacorp television series. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 29 HSA Annual Report 2008-09 30International Alliances that Work Recognising that the challenges and opportunities encountered bynational regulators of health products are similar across the globe,HSA continued to build on the firm partnerships with our overseascounterparts. Through these strong networks, we hope to generategreater efficiency and innovativeness in managing these challenges,as we share resources and leverage on systems to strengthencapabilities and synergies. HSA hosted the 3 rd Summit of Heads of Medicines Regulatory Agencies on 3 and 4 December 2008. This provided a platform for regulatoryagencies from some 20 countries to engage in dialogue on issues directlyrelated to their national responsibilities. These include immediatepriorities as well as future challenges. The forum also aimed to enable agency heads to interact in an informal setting to develop a deeper understanding of each other's work, stimulate new ideas generation,and explore new areas for collaboration. We put in significant effort to ensure that the programme was substantial and fruitful, and that delegates had a unique and enjoyable experience of Singapore, borneout by the positive feedback we received on the Summit event. We inked two more MOUs during the course of the year - one with Sweden's Medical Products Agency in November and another with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, United Kingdom in December. These collaborative arrangements - togetherwith those earlier established with our other MOU partners including the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch, Australia's Therapeutic GoodsAdministration, China's State Food and Drug Administration, and Swissmedic - will continue to pave the way to improve the safety, quality, and efficacy of health products marketed in each country. During the year, we also launched projects within our Regulatory Worksharing Grouping comprising the Therapeutic Goods Administration,Health Canada, Swissmedic and HSA. These included managing the quality and integrity of supply chain through joint inspections, building up post-approval pharmacovigilance efforts through adverse effectsmonitoring, and implementing a staff exchange programme.We are honoured to have been selected to co-host the 14 th International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) with the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Singapore from 6 to 11 September 2010. As one of the major conferences involvinghealth regulators around the globe, ICDRA has been held since 1980 with the aim of promoting exchange of information and collaborative approaches to health issues of common concerns. We are proud tobe involved in playing a major role in facilitating the discussions and decisions to be made at this platform, which is an important consultative forum for WHO and drug regulatory authorities in theirefforts to harmonise regulation and improve the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines. HSA's increasing involvement on the global stage reflects our role as a valued global partner on the international scene. The alliances with our global partners endorse our capabilities and expertise asa trusted regulatory body. Through the exchange of knowledge and best practices, we can better anticipate issues, and make swifter decisions to fulfill our core mission to protect and advance nationalhealth and safety effectively. We are now in the midst of exploring the establishment of a centralised academy set-up that will add significant value to the organisation by consolidating, supporting and developing our training, research and thought leadership capabilities, and enable us to make greatercontributions to the international community. Powered by People Building a workforce that is competent, resilient and engaged by attracting, developing, motivating and retaining core employeesremained at the centre of all our people policies during the year. This is because we recognise that our success as an organisation is a keyoutcome of the optimal match between each employee's professionalgrowth, personal goals and our business goals. We introduced new schemes of service to create a more holistic people management system that enhances career progression opportunities for staff. Our performance management system was also revamped to place a greater emphasis on the staff's individualperformance and competencies. This tied in with a new compensation framework which was finetuned for greater alignment with market practices. In line with our core value to Develop our Community, we remained committed to investing in our people through a comprehensive rangeof training programmes. The learning experience at HSA continued to be a systematic focused process that takes into account business goals and objectives and the skills needed by staff to meet the challengesof the changing environment around us. All officers were given many opportunities throughout the year to sharpen and enrich their skills, knowledge and competencies, to take them further in their currentroles or to take on new ones within the organisation. The HSA Professional Board was formed in January 2009 to advise and make recommendations to the CEO on issues relating to professional staff development and professional excellence. The Board is chaired by Dr Diana Teo, Group Director of the Blood Services Group, andcomprises advisors and members of staff from different scientific fields such as science, pharmacy, medicine and nursing. Its key priorities include further sharpening the strategic skills and competencies ofour staff with a longer-term aspiration to develop HSA into a renowned medical, scientific and regulatory education, training and research centre. Because we believe firmly that a supportive and welcoming work culture plays a big part in motivating staff to give of their best to theorganisation, the HSA Recreation Team worked hard to present anexciting menu of activities to all staff. From fitness walks and movie nights to anniversary parties, these successfully injected not only more fun, but created a stronger sense of unity and community within theHSA family. We continued to cultivate meaningful relationships amongst colleagues. Our staff members participated in regular dialogues and meet-upsessions with management. We are also working towards a CollectiveAgreement between the management and staff union to signify thecommitment from both sides in building a people-centred organisation. Our exemplary efforts in supporting staff development and well-being were recognised in more ways than one. Apart from being recertifiedas a People Developer organisation, we bagged the Singapore H.E.A.L.T.H.Gold Award for the third time in recognition of our policies in promotinghealthy workplace practices among our staff. We also received the Minister for Defence Award and the Home Team NS Award (Commendation) for the support given to our officers to be away fromwork because of National Service duties. Beyond our Mission Besides delivering on our core responsibilities, HSA is committed to making a positive difference to our community and environment as well. This promise was renewed during the year through a review ofthe framework and policies relating to our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework. The revised CARE Framework, as defined through its acronym for \"Community Action, Responsible for our Environment\",is aimed at developing a caring culture among all staff and encouraging them to contribute to various social causes in our community. Various programmes were organised during the year to encourage active volunteerism among staff. These included HSA's own blood donation drives and various fund raising projects for the CommunityChest as well as victims affected by the Sichuan earthquake in China and the cyclone in Myanmar. We also lent our support to programmes organised as part of the Yellow Ribbon Project, and conducted severalrecycling and energy conservation drives. Our CSR-oriented mindset, which is inherently embedded in our mission of protecting and promoting public health, will continue to be an integral part in thebusiness decisions we make. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 31 HSA Annual Report 2008-09 32On Track Towards a More Robust Regulatory System The past year saw new requirements under the Health Products Act coming into effect for medical devices andcosmetic products as part of the ongoing roll-out of their respective regulations. These were the first two groupsof products brought under the the new Act after it was passed by Parliament in February 2007. The Health Products Act serves to amalgamate the existing controls for regulating health products, which currently reside in various pieces of legislation, into one omnibus Act. When it comes into full effect, the Act will providemore flexibility for tailoring regulatory mechanisms for specific product groups, as well as strengthened powersfor post-market monitoring and enforcement. Moving forward, we plan to bring other groups such as complementary health products and therapeutic pharmaceutical products under the ambit of the Health Products Act. As part of the rollout, we will consult andcommunicate with our stakeholders, and also adopt a phased approach in the implementation for the smoothesttransition possible for businesses. In the past year, we were sensitive to the economic downturn and adjustedthe implementation measures or offered appropriate assistance to mitigate the impact on companies. These plansare all part of the ongoing efforts to develop a more robust regulatory system necessary to better protect, andensure safer, higher quality products for our people. Medical Devices Safety Enhanced The regulation of medical devices is being implemented in three phases. Phase 1, which started from 1 November2007, requires dealers to report all adverse events to HSA, notify us regarding voluntary product recalls and keepproduct movement records. We commenced Phase 2 in November 2008. We now accept applications for theproduct registration of medical devices, and the licensing of importers, wholesalers and manufacturers has takenplace. Industry briefings, workshops and several training sessions were conducted to familarise our industrypartners on our new regulatory guidances. We also worked with Singapore Accreditation Council to certify thirdparty certification bodies that can perform audit and certification of Good Distribution Practices for MedicalDevices (GDPMDS). The objective of GDPMDS standard is to provide a quality system for maintaining the qualityof medical devices throughout the distribution chain. Health Products Regulation Group The Health Products Regulation Group of HSA not only keeps in step with the wide spectrum of global trends in development and technological advancements in medical drugs and devices, but is also actively involved in defining new regulatory frameworks and pursuing new areas of research in regulatory science. This is what enables our regulatory group to ensure that health products in Singaporemeet internationally benchmarked standards of safety, efficacy and quality, but can also begin to pioneer innovative regulatory approaches that can serve as models for other smaller regulators who need to optimise the resources and expertise available to them. We recognise the challenges in this role, with changes around us taking place at an astounding pace. However, through our scientifically sound pre-and-post market regulatory processes and firm collaborations with other local and overseas agencies that share our mission, we have greater impetus to create the best outcomes for all - be they consumers or businesses whose products we regulate.A Closer Watch over Cosmetic Products The ASEAN Cosmetic Directive (ACD) has been implemented in all ASEANMember States except Myanmar and Indonesia. Under the ACD which setsthe regulatory requirements for cosmetic products sold in Singapore and otherASEAN member countries, dealers are required to notify HSA before importingany cosmetic product and making it available for sale. This facilitates thecreation of a full database of all cosmetic products in Singapore which inturn enables HSA to implement responsive post-market procedures to effectswift recall of unsafe products from the market. Companies benefit from the simple and fast notification process, and can launch products immediately after notification, so long as they ensure thatthe safety and quality of products conform to international standards. Ontheir part, consumers can enjoy quicker access to safe and quality cosmeticproducts and wider choices. At the same time, they are also better protectedthrough post-market surveillance initiatives under the ACD such as adverseevents reporting, targeted periodic sampling and testing, proper labelling,documentary evaluations and global alerts. Singapore hosted the 11 th ASEAN Cosmetic Committee (ACC) Meeting in November 2008. The session discussed updates on the implementation andenforcement of the ACD and the latest developments in ASEAN EconomicIntegration, and agreed on proposals from the ASEAN Cosmetic ScientificBody (ACSB). Singapore, as the lead country also updated the meeting on theASEAN Cosmetic Reference Laboratories (ACRL) Network and the ASEAN Post-marketing Alert System. Manufacturing Standards Across ASEAN Aligned We participated in the ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards & QualityPharmaceutical Product Working Group (ACCSQ PPWG) Meeting held in July2008 during which several key decisions were made. The meeting agreed onthe full implementation of the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier (ACTD) inJanuary 2009, marking a significant milestone in regional harmonisationefforts in the pharmaceutical sector. A common technical dossier format willnow be accepted by all member states for drug registration purposes. Anotherkey achievement was the finalisation and subsequent signing of the SectoralMutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing PracticeInspection. This is a key step towards ensuring internationally-recognisedmanufacturing standards of pharmaceuticals in ASEAN. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 33HSA Annual Report 2008-09 34With Business Needs in Mind Creating a positive experience for businesses transacting with usremains a prime consideration as we refine our policies and practices.We commenced a major Business Process Review (BPR) in January2009 to review and redesign key regulatory processes. This is withthe broader objective to enhance efficiency, clarity, consistency andcustomer-friendliness in our work procedures. Inputs from stakeholdersincluding the Ministry of Health, healthcare practitioners, industryand overseas health products regulators were taken into accountduring the review, which is expected to be completed by the thirdquarter of 2009. Several initiatives have been implemented resulting from the preliminary review. In February 2009, a new office to address theunique needs of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) was set-up.The SME Office seeks to be a one-stop centre offering SMEs assistanceon submission matters and provides these companies with additionalsupport in regulatory affairs. It is staffed by a pool of specially trainedClient Liaison Officers, most of whom have professional backgroundsin various scientific fields, and who also possess a sound understandingof all our regulatory requirements. Our officers personally attend toour SME clients' concerns on technical issues, advise them ondocumentation requirements and provide a single point of contactfor all matters pertaining to their respective submissions. We organised a series of regular meetings with industry partners at various levels - from line managers to CEOs - to explain our newregulatory policies and decisions, and also to seek feedback andresponses on upcoming plans. An industry newsletter HSA Connects has been introduced to keep industry stakeholders updated on ourvarious new initiatives and ongoing regulatory news. To complementthis, we conducted workshops to familarise businesses with theregulatory requirements needed when making submissions andupcoming policy changes. The sessions provided a useful forum forcompanies to discuss and clarify on our regulatory processes andtechnical issues, thus reducing uncertainty on steps needed forproduct submissions.Keeping in close touch with our stakeholders such as companies, industry associations and other service partners has enabled us todevelop processes that are more enterprise-centric, transparent andin tandem with the business climate. In view of the current downturn, we have put in place a Progressive Payment Scheme which lowers the upfront cost of product approvalfees for companies. Under this scheme, evaluation fees for medicalproducts are paid in four installments and each installment is paid onlywhen the product advances to the next stage of the evaluation process. We also implemented a new auto-renewal system for product licences during the year. Converting the system to an opt-out one means thatcompanies need only indicate which licences they do not wish to renew.This improvement resulted in considerable time savings and greaterconvenience for companies who have many product licences to maintainas they no longer need to submit annual renewals. In March 2009, HSA received a Commendation Award in the 2 nd Frontier Licence Review Award organised by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for the proposal to revamp its licence review frameworkto reduce costs and administrative effort on the part of companieswhose products we regulate. The merits of the proposal include therecommendation of converting the most number of licences tolifetime licensing (10 licences in total). As part of our commitment to constantly improve in our role as a national regulator, our priority will be on strengthening our capabilitiesin conducting risk assessments of new health products. This willallow even more timely evaluations and approvals of medicallyneeded health products. Strengthening Risk Management In spite of our best efforts to ensure that health products are as safe as possible before being placedon the market, we recognise that no product is 100 per cent safe. Our risk-based post-market systemto sample and test products from the shelves, complemented by our Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)Monitoring Programme enabled swift corrective responses when safety concerns came to light. The ADRMonitoring Programme, drawing on a network of local healthcare professionals to report productswhich caused unwanted and unexpected effects, was effective in tracking and identifying safety trends. The number of local spontaneous ADR reports reviewed by HSA increased from 1,740 in 2007 to 3,155 in 2008. Amongst the ADR reports received in 2008, about 55% were serious. 17 adulterated productswere detected via ADR reports in 2008. We moved up the World Health Organisation's (WHO) ranking of ADR reports per million from 14 th position in 2007 to 10 th position in 2008. This reflects that our ADR reporting system is robust and amongst the world's best, in which our healthcare professionals are proactively reporting ADRs theyobserve in their practice. This in turn helps us to pick up safety signals from the local use of marketedproducts more efficiently, and facilitates quick recalls if needed. We made information on emerging safety issues more readily available and easily accessible to healthcare professionals through our Adverse Drug Reaction News Bulletin to increase the awareness of ADRs and promote ADR reporting. This publication has been accredited by the Singapore Medical Council, theSingapore Dental Council and the Singapore Pharmacy Board, for Continuing Education points. Thisencouraging move reflects the healthcare professional fraternity's appreciation of the publication'squality. It is also testament of the fraternity's recognition that keeping abreast of drug safety issues isessential for professional knowledge and healthcare practice. We further enhanced our review of risk management plans (RMPs) submitted by product licence holders as part of the life cycle approach to minimise the risks associated with new products. From the periodJune 2008 to May 2009, we reviewed about 20 RMPs that were submitted either at pre-market evaluationor post-market stage, including Revlimid\u00ae, Yondelis\u00ae and Exjade\u00ae. Some of the regulatory actionsresulting from the review of the RMPs included safety updates to the product insert and the submissionof safety reports to address potential safety concerns not identified at the point of product registration. Last year, we initiated the recall of 22 health products from the market. These came from various product groups, including pharmaceutical products, Chinese Proprietary Medicines and health supplements. Fiveof these products were recalled as they were adulterated, while the remaining ones were found to beunsafe because they were out-of-specification. Going forward, we will continue to strengthen our risk management tools, to better manage risk of health products throughout their life cycles. Efforts in risk communication to healthcare professionalswill be stepped up, through early warnings of emerging or potential drug safety problems and promotingsafer use of drugs and health products. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 35HSA Annual Report 2008-09 36Our Unwavering Stance Our enforcement efforts against illegal health products were steppedup during the year through more intensive surveillance operationsand intelligence gathering. Through more than 2,500 investigationsconducted, about 10,600,000 units (comprising dosage forms oftablets, capsules, liquids and creams) of counterfeit and unregisteredhealth products were seized. Assuming an estimated street value of$2.50 per tablet, the seizures amounted to about $26,504,800. We took our fight against illegal health products to the global front as well. We participated in the 3 rd General Meeting of the World Health Organisation's International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT) in Tunisia in December 2008.Singapore, together with the rest of the members of the IMPACTPlanning Group, was re-nominated into office by the assembly foranother two years. WHO launched IMPACT in 2006 to combat theglobal problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Bringing togethernearly two hundred countries, as well as organisations with expertisein enforcement, manufacturing, and patient advocacy, IMPACT hascalled attention to the commercial and public health costs ofmedicines that are deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled andoffered a global forum for discussing solutions. This latest meetingagreed on a revised version of the term \"Counterfeit Medical Product\" .This new text will provide greater clarity and transparency in differentiatingand addressing various contentious issues raised by members. We hosted the 11 th Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC) Meeting from 2 to 5 June 2008. The closed-doorsession was attended by representatives from more than 14 membercountries and organisations from the USA, UK, Australia andSwitzerland. This included presentations, information exchanges anddiscussions on the latest trends in pharmaceutical crime activity andenforcement related issues on dealing with increasing sophisticationof such activities.In partnership with the PFIPC, we conducted a coordinated operation against illegal websites selling medicines over the Internet on12 November 2008, which was designated International InternetDay of Action. The main objective of this coordinated sweep was totake action to prevent and tackle deceptive marketing practicesthrough a global initiative. The global and borderless nature of theInternet and the ease with which illegal medicines can be boughtand sold in different countries around the world pose a threat topublic health. Such coordinated international efforts demonstratean international will to tackle the Internet problem, and are consideredmost strategically effective in addressing this public health challenge. In our efforts to curb the supply of tobacco products to underage smokers, we apprehended over 60 sellers who sold tobacco productsto underage youths. A total of 6,662 underage smokers were caughtduring the year. Together with the Health Promotion Board, weproduced a Tobacco Retailer Educational Toolkit to assist tobaccoretailers in Singapore to better comply with the law governingtobacco products and to adopt the \"best practices\" to avoid sale oftobacco products to underage customers. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 37 Sharpening Capabilities To deepen and broaden our pharmacogenetics knowledge, and in turn, boost our capacityfor advancements in drug regulation and safety, we commenced work on a project tocreate an innovative surveillance network to quickly capture serious ADRs that shouldbe investigated for possible pharmacogenetics linkage. The project, which will establish the necessary infrastructure and frameworks in pharmacogenetics, will bring about immediate benefits such as reducing the risk of ADRsthrough the identification and/or validation of genetic associations and in the longerterm, facilitate the development of an innovative post-marketing system. It will alsoenable the efficient management of pharmacogenetic data submissions for new drugapplication or product label updates. The groundwork for this project was established with the formation of an operational group within HSA working in collaboration with a network of research facilities andhospitals. This network will facilitate the collection of patients' samples and clinicalhistories arising from targeted ADRs. We built a network of collaborations and partnershipswith researchers and clinicians for the analysis and interpretation of pharmacogeneticassays, and convened a Pharmacogenetics Advisory Committee to advise HSA in theseefforts. We also participated in international activities that have similar goals to sharedata and to glean information about polymorphisms in Asian populations. Powerful Partnerships HSA strives to be synonymous with partnerships. We are keenly aware that the challenges facing regulatory agenciestoday cannot be addressed single-handedly by any one organisation, but through joint efforts. This is why we valueevery opportunity to learn from others, and in turn bring into these collaborative arrangements our cross-disciplinaryperspectives. Only through partnerships can we be strong today and even stronger tomorrow as we pursue our missionwith vigour. We were included as a member of the Global Co-operation Group (GCG) for the International Conference for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), and participatedin our first conference in June 2008. The focus of ICH has been on the technical requirements for medicinal productscontaining new drugs and comprises regulatory and industry members from Europe, Japan and the USA. The GCG isa sub-committee of the ICH Steering Committee and includes members from non-ICH regions. Our induction intothe Group is recognition of our role as an active contributor in drugs development and regulatory standards. We continued our efforts to broaden our global network and strengthen co-operation with regulators internationally through the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the Medical Products Agency (Sweden), and theMedicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (United Kingdom) during the year. The scope of the MOUsencompasses mutual exchanges and scientific collaborations spanning a range of work areas. These include therapeuticproducts evaluation, establishment inspection, adverse events investigation, worksharing on pharmacovigilanceactivities, expertise in IT information and management, and training and development. The MOUs formalise the strategicalliances and co-operation between HSA and our regulatory counterparts, and create opportunities for us to leverageon the abilities of collaborating authorities to make timely, effective and scientifically sound regulatory decisions. We also saw successes in our collaborative arrangements with our other MOU partners - including the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration,China's State Food and Drug Administration, and Switzerland's Swissmedic. These were through the areas of productevaluations, pharmacovigilance, Good Manufacturing Practice inspections and staff exchange programmes. Potential new partnerships were explored as well. We hosted a visit in March 2009 by Dr Tatsuo Kurokawa, a Professor for Pharmaceutical Development at Chiba University, Japan and previously the Japanese representative to the ICHSteering Committee. During his stay, Dr Kurokawa shared from his experience on pharmacovigilance activities andglobal drug development initiatives in Japan, and also heard from HSA and external stakeholders such as the NationalHealthcare Group and the Economic Development Board on Singapore's progress in these areas. Through this visit,bilateral relations between both countries were strengthened and new possibilities for future opportunities forcollaboration with Japan were created.

The number of blood donors comingforward continues to increase annually, with 60,654 donors making 92,454whole blood and 9,506 apheresis donations in 2008. Donor recruitmentprogrammes focused on the campaign theme of \"Are you my type?\" thattargeted young people between 16 to 25 years and aimed to entrenchblood donation as an iconic part of their youth culture. Every year, World Blood Donor Day is celebrated globally to honour voluntary altruistic blood donors who regularly donate the 'Gift of Life'to help those in need of blood transfusion. In 2008, World Blood DonorDay was celebrated in Singapore on 14 June with the theme of \"GivingBlood Regularly\" . Blood donors were invited to celebrate with theirfamilies and friends at the Singapore Zoo. 1,318 Champion Blood Donorswere honoured at ceremonies held in the picturesque settings overlookingthe lake. 37 bloodmobile organisers were also recognised for theirinvaluable contributions to the community during the ceremonies.Continuing with our drive over previous years to make blood donation more convenient, several new initiatives were introduced. To reducethe waiting time for donation, blood donors making blood donationappointments online have the option of completing their pre-donationhealth assessment questionnaires online before coming down to theBloodbank@HSA. The health and safety of our blood donors remains an important area of focus. To protect the iron levels of our blood donors, iron-rich desserts were added to the post-donation refreshments provided.We have also enhanced the care of regular donors with lowhaemoglobin levels, putting in place programmes to monitor theiriron levels and provide counselling on how to improve thehaemoglobin levels. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 44Blood Services Group As the national blood service, the Blood Services Group of HSA diligently keeps in focus its critical life saving and life giving mission in every aspect of its operations. Quality and safety are guaranteed through internationally accredited blood bank and transfusion medicine protocols, thus ensuring every patient access to the safest possible blood supply appropriate to clinical need. To lend further impetus to our commitment to deliver a world-class blood service, we continually strive to achieve the highest level of excellence. By judiciously adopting latest knowledge and innovatively adapting new technologies, we maintain our edge in the fields of transfusion medicine, immunohaematology and tissue typing so that we can continue to deliver blood products and services of the highest standards. At the same time, we are actively engaged in cutting edge areas of therapeutic research such as cell processing.HSA Annual Report 200 8-09 45Adopting New Technologies to Enhance Blood Supply Safety and QualityMaintaining stringent and strong quality systems in blood processing, testing,inventory management and distribution remains the top priority of our BloodSupply Management Laboratories. With rapid advances in blood banktechnology, new and improved systems for processing and testing the bloodsupply are continuously made available. By wisely adopting new technologiesthat are appropriate to our blood service and continuously adapting existingprocesses innovatively, we aim to ensure that our national blood supply isefficiently and effectively managed. New technologies were adopted to ensure that blood donations continue to be screened for blood types and transfusion-transmitted infectiousdiseases using state-of-the-art systems. New protocols to screen blooddonations for malaria were explored to improve the safety of blood collectedfrom donors who had returned from malaria endemic areas. New bloodbag systems incorporating sample diversion pouches were introduced, thusreducing the risk of bacterial infection as well as improving workplacesafety for our staff. We are also studying the new developments in pathogen reduction technology that will enable blood components such as platelets and plasmato be treated to inactivate low levels of viruses, bacteria and parasites thatmay be present. A two-year pilot study is ongoing to assess the clinicaluse of methylene-blue treated fresh frozen plasma. Research projects arealso in progress to study the effectiveness of two types of pathogeninactivation protocols (psoralen and riboflavin) available for platelets. In addition, much work is taking place to develop effective strategies to manage the blood supply in the face of emerging threats such as dengue,chikungunya and novel influenza strains. Research was also done to assessthe risk of non-infectious transfusion complications such as TransfusionAssociated Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) and to assess appropriate measures toreduce these risks. Successful strategies must always balance the need toensure patient safety without compromise to the availability of supply andtimely access to blood transfusions when required.Providing High Quality Immunohaematology and Tissue Typing SupportWith introduction of new medical procedures and treatments in ourhealthcare institutions, it is critical to put in place timely and relevantlaboratory and blood transfusion support to assure best possibleoutcomes for the patient. For example, with the introduction ofABO-incompatible kidney transplants in Singapore, ourImmunohaematology Laboratories provided critical laboratory testingto support the treatment. The Immunohaematology Laboratories also continued to upgrade and expand our capabilities to meet international standards as a redcell reference laboratory. Research projects in the area of molecular-based blood group typing contribute towards the development ofexpertise in this growing area of transfusion medicine. The Tissue Typing Laboratory continued to provide high quality support to the haematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantprogrammes in Singapore, as well as some other countries in ourRegion. To assure that transplant programmes are provided withthe best possible laboratory support, the laboratory introduced newtechniques of HLA antibody detection based on flow cytometry.Even newer technologies involving more sensitive and speedy methodsof antibody detection and identification are also being evaluated,as well as the study of possible genetic sequencing methods for HLAtyping in future.Collaborations with Clinical Colleagues As a reference centre for transfusion medicine, immunohaematologyand tissue typing, we maintain strong links with our hospitals withthe aim of providing patients the best possible care through ourclinical consultative services. To ensure that blood and blood components are appropriately transfused for the correct clinical indications, our doctors worked closely with theirhospital colleagues to develop robust protocols for handling complicatedmedical situations needing blood. Such protocols continue to improvethe speed and effectiveness of blood transfusion support, for example,during liver transplants and obstetric emergencies. The National Haemovigilance Programme, initiated in 2003 in collaboration with public and private Hospital Transfusion Committees,continued to function effectively to gather local data to assess thefrequency of blood transfusion complications and to enable continuedimprovement efforts to be taken to reduce such complications. Anew initiative has been the inclusion of donor haemovigilance tostudy the complications associated with blood donation. The Haemovigilance Programme in Singapore is part of wider groups such as the International Haemovigilance Network (IHN) and theInternational Society for Blood Transfusion Working Party onHaemovigilance. Through such collaborations, our Blood ServicesGroup is able to compare data and information, as well as toparticipate actively in the development of international standards,definitions and indicators. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 46Attaining International Benchmarks of Excellence We were proud to achieve accreditation in August 2008 by the American Society for Histocompatibilityand Immunogenetics (ASHI) for tissue typing and transplant support activities. The guiding principleof emphasising excellence in all areas of our work enabled our Tissue Typing Laboratory to attainthis distinction, which is awarded only upon demonstration of the highest standards of reliabilityand quality in Histocompatibility testing laboratories. HSA's Blood Services Group is one of onlytwo national blood services in Asia to have achieved this accreditation. The ASHI accreditation follows our international accreditation by AABB (formerly known as American Association of Blood Banks) for blood banking activities since 2006. The AABB accreditation for bloodbanking and transfusion activities demonstrates our commitment to advanced learning, continuousimprovement and innovation by striving to sustain the highest possible levels of patient and donor care.

As a valued partner of WHO in its work to promote andimprove standards of blood supply quality and safety globally, weparticipated in global and regional expert consultations, fora andworkshops to develop appropriate policies, recommendations andguidelines relevant to blood supply quality and safety. We alsoconducted training programmes covering the full spectrum of ourwork, sharing our experiences during study visits and attachmentprogrammes involving health officials, blood banks and hospital stafffrom other countries. A key initiative with WHO has been the Singapore-WHO Joint Training Workshop on Management of National Blood Programmes. Withthe support from the Singapore Government and WHO, the workshophas been held annually since 2007 and aims to provide directors andnational managers from blood services in the region with knowledgeof current concepts and practices in planning, managing andmonitoring national blood programmes. It has also served as anexcellent platform for close networking and cooperation amongstblood services in our region. The 2 nd workshop was held in July 2008, and focused on critical areas such as donor recruitmentprogrammes, human resource management, training and education,inventory and supply management, and clinical aspects. Through our many strategic partnerships and collaborations, we have been able to participate in valuable information sharing initiatives,significant research and developmental projects, and formulation ofwide-ranging international guidelines and policies. An importantregional initiative has been the Asia Pacific Blood Network (APBN)of which Singapore is a founding member, and which aims tostrengthen regional cooperation and networking, and promote bloodsafety and efficiency of blood service operations among members.Activities include information updates, comparison of practices, jointpurchasing initiatives, regional disaster management and emergencyframeworks, formulation of white papers and regional guidelines.Other major regional initiatives included two training programmes organised with our colleagues in the blood services of Malaysia andMyanmar. The first Malaysia-Singapore Joint Workshop on BloodDonor Management was held at the National Blood Centre in KualaLumpur in December 2008. During the two-and-a-half dayprogramme, participants were able to share ideas and information,exchange experiences, and discuss issues of common concern.Through the many lively group discussions, presentations, forumsand role-playing activities, the workshop was an invaluable opportunityto further cement the strong ties between the two blood services. The Blood Group Serology Project is a technical skills training programme jointly organised between HSA's Blood Services Group and the NationalBlood Centre in Yangon. Sponsored by the Singapore InternationalFoundation, the three-year programme seeks to enhance the bloodserology and clinical transfusion programmes in the blood services inMyanmar. Laboratory and medical staff from our Blood Services Groupand the Singapore General Hospital will provide hands-on laboratorytraining. Since the first training workshop in 2007, signficant benefitshave been realised and partnerships developed. Looking Forward to the Future Exciting developments have been taking place at our Cell ProcessingLaboratory. Medical advances have demonstrated that different humanimmune cells may play vital roles in the treatment of cancer and otherdiseases. The Cell Processing Laboratory enables the selection andexpansion of these cells outside the human body in a sterile and stringentmanner, so that they can be safely and effectively infused into thepatients for treatment. One particular focus is on a type of immune cell called the natural killer (NK) cells. Researchers in our laboratory continue to study molecularmechanisms underlying enhanced killing of defective cells using NKcytotoxicity, and through this knowledge, developing the means toimprove NK expansion procedures. An ongoing clinical study in collaboration with clinical colleagues from the Singapore General Hospital involved in stem cell transplantationinvolves the administration of another special type of immune cell calledthe cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells. CIK cells are cultured in ourlaboratory and infused into patients with various blood malignanciessuch as leukaemia. With the success of the pilot Cell Processing Laboratory and increasing demand for laboratory space, plans are underway to expand it to aninternationally accredited Cellular Therapy Facility. With an additionalfour processing rooms, the future facility will provide a cutting-edgetranslational platform for clinicians and scientists to scale up promisingresearch protocols in the transition from bench to bedside. Future research programmes will include developing novel cell therapy products arising from promising findings in genomics, immunology andproteonomics. Our new capacities and capabilities will continue tostrengthen our valued partnership with hospitals and biomedical researchinstitutions in clinical translational trials. It will also give additionaladvantage to the thrust towards becoming a regional and internationalreference centre for new advances in cellular therapy. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 49Poised for More Breakthroughs The work processes at the Mortuary@HSA continued to be transformedby technology following the full implementation of FIONA (ForensicIntegrated Operations Network Applications) during the year. Someof the system's key features include Radio-Frequency Identification(RFID) tracking of bodies and WiFi networks combined with tablet PCsto enable mortuary staff to capture essential data in real time and atsource within their respective environments. Such enhancements addto greater operational process efficiency and accountability. We successfully conducted an exercise to field test the operational readiness of our containerised mobile biosafety level 4 (BSL4) autopsyfacility. A patented invention by HSA and local firm ACRE EngineeringPte Ltd, the mobile facility provides a high level containment spaceand protection for our forensic pathologists to conduct autopsieson bodies which could be infected with highly infectious diseases.Apart from allowing maximum containment capability at the nationallevel during a disease outbreak situation, the facility also has thecapacity for investigations on homicidal deaths arising from acts ofbioterrorism to be conducted. Abuzz with In-house Innovations We collaborated with the Bomb and Explosives InvestigationDepartment of the Singapore Police Force to conceptualise and createa local Vehicle Paint Database for criminal and counter-terrorisminvestigations in Singapore. The database comprises vehicle informationand chemical information of vehicle paint collected from arepresentative population of local vehicles. The physical featuresand chemical compositions of unknown paint fragments recoveredfrom scenes can be searched through the database to obtain vitalinformation such as the vehicle make, model and even, colour of theunknown vehicle. Statistical and trend analyses also allow trackingof paint formulation changes in different vehicle makes and models over the years. Such details will facilitate investigations in hit-and-run traffic accidents, the search for crime vehicles and also possiblevehicles used as vehicle bombs in a terrorist attack. A total of 3,200 evidence collection kits and blood screening kits developed and produced in-house were supplied to the Police. Thesekits, which come in seven different types, were customised to locallaw enforcement needs, quality assured, and self-contained with thenecessary tools to preserve evidence collected at crime scenes. Theyhave been designed to enable evidence collection at crime scenesto proceed more efficiently and quickly while protecting evidenceintegrity, which is of utmost importance to withstand court scrutinyand ensure error-free results. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 50Applied Sciences Group Representing the national expertise in forensic medicine and science, analytical testing and metrology in chemistry, the Applied Sciences Group of HSA is in action around the clock. Rigorous and robust scientific principles are applied in our constant pursuit for breakthroughs in new frontiers achieved through innovative research in testing methodologies. Upgrading our capabilities and upscaling our capacities gives us fresh impetus to consistently provide the highest quality forensic response and scientific analysis to support other regulatory and compliance agencies clients in the administration of justice and the safeguarding of public health.Vibrancy and Verve at our Labs During the year, we saw several new work methods and processes being developed at ourstable of laboratories. We invested in advanced instruments to meet the increasingdemands of emerging techniques, which require an advanced level of precision andaccuracy. These efforts fortify our core capabilities to meet or exceed our customers'expectations through our authoritative, evidence-based, and value-added solutions. Towards Safer Pharmaceuticals Our Pharmaceutical Laboratory expanded its accredited screening list for westerndrug adulterants in herbal medicines by 33 new drugs to a total of 413 western drugs.In addition, the screening of two new alkaloids, berberine and tetrahydroplamatine,using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry was also successfullyaccredited according to ISO standards. The laboratory also successfully renewed itsISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation for three years. We made advancements in our fight against illegal products through the development of a methodology for quick and non-destructive screening of counterfeit drugs inSingapore. Conventional forensic techniques resulted in rapid and easy differentiationsbetween unknown and authentic samples. We are also currently developing newadvanced techniques in identifying common sources of origin of the counterfeit drugswith the acquisition of a highly sensitive instrument, the Isotope Ratio MassSpectrometer - the first-of-its-kind in Singapore. An Added Boost for Food Safety Our Food Safety Laboratory enjoyed a record achievement when it was reassessed andaccredited by SAC-SINGLAS for six new tests in November 2008, and 24 new tests inMarch 2009. With the successful accreditation of the various new testing methods forfood additives, food packaging contaminants, environmental contaminants and mycotoxins,we are now offering our clients a wider range of reliable services, while providing themrenewed confidence and assurance in the quality of our analytical services. One such example is a test method that incorporates the accelerated solvent extraction system to extract analytes more efficiently. As fewer solvents and reagents are used,this method is not only environmentally friendlier, but also significantly reduces theoperating costs and solvent disposal costs involved. This in turn offers our clients amore cost-effective and timely service. Going forward, we will be working on a project to develop a method for the extraction and analysis of Nitropropionic acid (NPA) and Nitropropanol (NPOH) from sugarcanejuices. As the mycotoxin 3-Nitropronionic acid has only been recently discovered,there has been no scientific data available for the analysis of both NPA and NPOHyet. Our completed method will serve as an additional service for our customers,such as the Agrifood and Veterinary Authority, and facilitate decisions on implementingsuitable regulations on food safety. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 51Beyond upscaling our scientific capabilities, we remained committed to providing a total package that enhances our clients' experiencewith us. This is especially so during critical periods when turnaroundtimes can have a pressing impact on business priorities and consumersafety. For instance, during the melamine crisis in October 2008,our Food Safety Laboratory provided a host of other value-addedservices to our customers apart from food testing. We created adatabase on the melamine content of all the milk products from allthe different international branches of a global customer, enablingit to keep track of the quality of its products internationally. Wealso exercised flexibility in customising the payment arrangementsfor each of the branches for their convenience. More Testing Services for Cosmetics To meet the increasing demands ofregulatory needs, our CosmeticLaboratory also introduced Tandem MassSpectrometry. The laboratory's SAC-SINGLAS accreditation was alsosuccessfully renewed during the year. A Significant Step Forward HSA was officially appointed by the National Metrology Centre atthe Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) as aDesignated Institute for Chemical Metrology in the medical andpharmaceutical fields, as well as in the areas of food, healthcareand forensics. The HSA Act was amended to empower HSA to takeon this additional responsibility.A new Chemical Metrology Division was also formed within HSA's Applied Sciences Group to establish the chemical metrologyinfrastructure and building up capabilities. It will support the workof the joint HSA-A*STAR Metrology in Chemistry Steering Committee,which will oversee the development of the chemical metrologyprogramme in Singapore. With this new capability being added to our growing pool of expertise in the applied sciences, we are now recognised by the BureauInternational des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), an international bodythat ensures worldwide uniformity of measurements and theirtraceability to the International System of Units, and have alsobecome a full member of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme.Through study visits and attachment programmes, we strengthenedties with overseas agencies such as the National MeasurementInstitute (Australia) and the National Institute of Metrology (China). Our Chemical Metrology Laboratory, currently being built in a clean- room environment, is slated to be operational by August 2009. Itwill house a special \"metal-free section\" for inorganic analysis andwill boast state-of-the-art instruments. Going forward, we willfocus on organising proficiency testing surveys in partnership withthe Singapore Accreditation Council to assess the quality dataproduced by local testing laboratories and promoting this new fieldto the industry. Tapping on our Built-in Edge The year saw us sharpening the synergiesacross the fields of expertise within theGroup and across the organisation in moreways. This multi-disciplinary approach inour planning and execution processes willcontinue to strengthen our ability to respondeffectively to our business environment, andalso demonstrate the value of our work toall we serve. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 52A Synthesis of Skill Sets The joint capabilities from our Forensic Chemistry and PhysicsLaboratory and Pharmaceutical Laboratory have contributed insignificant ways to the fight against counterfeit drugs. On its part,the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory thoroughly conductsmicroscopic examinations of packaging materials, tablets and capsulesand chemical profiling of counterfeit drugs through varioussophisticated techniques. It is the only laboratory in Singapore andone of the few worldwide able to trace the drugs to their source oforigin by characterising their stable isotope ratios through IsotopeRatio Mass Spectrometry. Complementing this, the PharmaceuticalLaboratory meticulously works towards confirming the identity ofthe active pharmaceutical ingredients found in the counterfeits,using various chromatographic techniques. Chemical assays of theactive pharmaceutical ingredients, which may be present only inminute amounts, are also conducted to quantify them. With the synergistic application of the capabilities from these two laboratories, HSA is able to provide a more complete and comprehensivecharacterisation and identification of counterfeit drugs.Our laboratories provided analyses for suspicious samples of health products seized locally by the Enforcement Branch in our HealthProducts Regulation Group, and also those through Operation Storm,an INTERPOL-WHO initiative against the transnational traffickingof counterfeit medicines in the Great Mekong Sub-region. Theexamination of samples received contributes to a database oncounterfeit drugs maintained by HSA. Last year, 252 counterfeitdrug samples were analysed. These included antibiotics, antimalarials,anti-platelet, antipsychotics and erectile dysfunction drugs. Ourinternational collaboration with INTERPOL-WHO has established usas a reputable reference centre for counterfeit drug analysis andinvestigation. We are proud to be able to play a part in tackling theglobal issue of counterfeit medicines on the global stage. Counterfeitmedicines not only impact the business bottomlines of responsibledrug companies, but many of them have been shown to causeextremely harmful and damaging health issues such as drug resistance,adverse reactions and even death. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 53Food Safety Division Analytical Tests for Laboratory samples 23,20623,206 Analytical Cases 4,5204,520 Analytical Tests for Laboratory Samples 23,95523,955 Analytical Cases 4,4754,475Pharmaceutical Division Forensic Cases 39,00039,000 Forensic Exhibits 75,00075,000Illicit Drugs & Toxicology Divison Forensic Cases 21,81521,815 Forensic Exhibits Pooled to Investigate Suspected Arsenic Poisoning Case We successfully assisted the Police in the analytical investigation ofa suspected arsenic poisoning case by pooling together a uniquecross-functioning team of highly specialised expertise in forensicand analytical sciences. The case had involved the testing for arsenicin food products, unknown substances and biological specimens(blood, urine, hair and nail clippings). While our Analytical Toxicology Laboratory provided expertise to analyse biological specimens, we were able to utilise the advancedinstrument, Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometery (ICP/MS)available at our Food Safety Laboratory, combined with the experiencesof our Food Safety and Pharmaceutical Laboratories in heavy metalsanalysis. With such synergies, we are also able to leverage on shared resources, technological capabilities and extensive state-of-the-art equipment thathave resulted in significant cost savings and faster turnaround time. Practices In Forensic Medicine Boost Safety Standards at Cigarette Testing LaboratoryDrawing from the experience of Forensic Medicine in good biosafetypractices and risk reduction, officers at our Cigarette Testing Laboratoryare also now using the Jupiter Suit as their personal protectiveequipment against the inhalation of smoke particulates generatedduring smoking experiments. This transfer of experience from biosafetypractices in our Forensic Medicine Division to a laboratory environmentoffers better protection to staff and has improved the safety standardsacross the organisation. Officials from the World Health Organisationobserved this practice in our laboratory during a visit and haverecommended that this be put in place across all laboratories inSingapore conducting similar activities.Synergistic Steps Towards Health Product Safety Our laboratories also supported the surveillance and enforcementoperations of our regulatory role by sourcing for portable instrumentsfor on-site screening of health products. Scientists will help tomaintain the equipment and ensure that the library of drugs isregularly updated. This in turn will bring about a radical change toand enhance our surveillance and enforcement capabilities. Following an alert on several brands of hot/cold compress packs being recalled in Australia, our laboratories conducted an urgentanalysis of the contents of samples found in Singapore. The testsconfirmed that the packs sold in Singapore also contained the highlytoxic antifreeze agent found in those overseas. This in turn led toour regulatory arm initiating a nationwide retail recall of the packsimmediately before they could cause any harm to consumers. More cross-functional projects are in the pipeline. Our laboratories are exploring a faster and more cost-effective technique to detectand quantify the amount of leaching of potentially hazardousplasticisers from medical devices made of PVC. This project willprovide scientific support to our regulatory operations to minimisethe risks associated with devices containing PVC. HSA Annual Report 2008-09 XXHSA Annual Report 2008-09 54Strengthening Ties at Home and Globally We continued to place high priority on deepening and broadeningour partnerships during the year. This is driven by a keen awarenessthat collaborative arrangements are the way to go in today's everchanging environment. An agreement between HSA and the National University of Singapore signed in November 2008 has made it possible for undergraduatesto immerse themselves in the intriguing field of forensic sciencesthrough a new minor programme. The Advanced Forensic Sciencemodule, the first and only in Singapore, will enable undergraduatesto hear HSA's practising forensic scientists share on topics such asscientific ethics, trace evidence, DNA profiling, drugs and toxicology.The module, which includes both theory and practical sessions, placesa great emphasis on the rigorous application of science, objectivereasoning and sound interpretation of physical evidence to serve theneeds of the justice system. A forensic group network meeting involving six ASEAN countries was held at HSA from 14 to 15 October 2008. The meeting, co-hosted byHSA, KIMIA Malaysia and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,concluded with the formation of the Asian Forensic Sciences Network.Dr Paul Chui, Group Director, Applied Sciences Group, HSA, was electedas the interim president of this forum. Our involvement in this forumpaves the way for us to contribute as a thought leader to the network'sgoals of promoting, advancing and enhancing the quality of professionalforensic scientific practice in Asia. We signed a Letter of Collaboration with the Shanghai Institute of Food and Drug Control to formalise a new framework of cooperationon issues related to Traditional Chinese Medicines and healthsupplements. This will be done through cross training of technicalstaff, information exchanges, provision of consultancy services andthe identification of more scientific activities for collaboration.In the year under review, our Pharmaceutical Laboratory was designated a WHO Prequalified Quality Control Laboratory inpharmaceuticals under the WHO Prequalification of MedicinesProgramme. As the only WHO-recognised pharmaceutical laboratoryin Singapore, HSA joins nine other laboratories worldwide to providethe United Nations agencies with the testing service for pharmaceuticalproducts the agencies intend to procure to benefit those in need. Our Cigarette Testing Laboratory celebrated the honour to be the first testing laboratory in the Western Pacific Region to be designated aWHO Collaborating Centre for Tobacco Testing and Research. Ourlaboratory was also appointed by the Ministry of Health, Brunei, as itsreference laboratory for tar and nicotine testing on regulatory compliance. Our Food Safety Laboratory was successfully re-designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Food Contamination Monitoring in September2008 for another four years. Our food database on the analyticalresults of food samples carried out over the years will continue toprovide useful information for WHO to identify trends to reinforcefood safety for consumers. In our capacity as a WHO Collaborating Centre and an EC-ASEAN Reference Laboratory for Mycotoxin Analysis, we also had the privilegeof sharing our expertise to help overseas agencies gain new knowledgeand skills to apply in their home countries.
