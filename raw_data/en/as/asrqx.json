It involves the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, and food therapy as the treatment of disease. Healthy animals are viewed as being in balance with the internal environment of the body and external environment; disease occurs when there is an imbalance due to infection, nutrition, heredity, climate, and other pathogenic factors. In Chinese medicine the body is seen as a whole and disease signals an imbalance within the patient and not one body system. A detailed history about environment and diet, as well as a comprehensive physical examination will aid a complete diagnosis. Treatment involves a combination of acupuncture, herbal medicine, and food therapy but varies depending on the diagnosis and patient, as sometimes all modalities are not plausible. TCVM is a softer method of treatment as it is typically safe with minimal side effects or adverse reactions. Its aim is to restore health rather than simply alleviate symptoms. It can be used for any health condition and has proved to work when other methods of treatment have been unsuccessful. TCVM can also be used as an adjunct to traditional Western medicine to provide the best and most comprehensive treatment possible.
