From molecular to genomic epidemiology: transforming surveillance and control of infectious diseases. Euro Surveill. 2013;18(4):pii=20386. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20386 Article published on 24 January 2013 The use of increasingly powerful genotyping tools for the characterisation of pathogens has become a standard component of infectious disease surveil - lance and outbreak investigations. This thematic issue of Eurosurveillance , published in two parts, provides a series of review and original research articles that gauge progress in molecular epidemiology strategies and tools, and illustrate their applications in pub - lic health. Molecular epidemiology of infectious dis - eases combines traditional epidemiological methods with analysis of genome polymorphisms of pathogens over time, place and person across human popula - tions and relevant reservoirs, to study host-pathogen interactions and infer hypotheses about host-to-host or source-to-host transmission [1-3]. Based on dis - criminant genotyping of human pathogens, clonally derived strains can be identified as likely links in a chain of transmission [1-3]. In this two-part issue of Eurosurveillance , Goering et al. explain that such bio - logical evidence of clonal linkage complements but does not replace epidemiological evidence of person-to-person contact or common exposure to a poten - tial source [3]. Muellner et al. provide clear examples how prediction about infectious disease outcome and transmission risks can be enhanced through integra - tion of pathogen genetic information and epidemiologi - cal modelling to inform public health decisions about food-borne disease prevention [4]. As reviewed by Sabat et al., epidemic source tracing requires timely deployment of high resolution typing methods that index variation of genomic elements with a fast molecular clock [1-5]. For outbreak stud - ies, comparative methods, as opposed to library typ - ing methods, are sufficient, and the higher the power to resolve micro-evolutionary distance, the greater the likelihood to decide between alternative transmission hypotheses generated by observational epidemiology [1-6]. Once standardised to enable a uniform genotype nomenclature across laboratories, thereby providing a library typing system, such discriminatory methods can be further applied to control-oriented surveillance [1-5]. Early outbreak detection is achieved by geno - typing prospectively as many consecutive cases in a population as possible to identify clusters of clonally linked isolates [5]. Examples include PulseNet, the nationwide food-borne disease surveillance system in the United States [7] as well as national molecular surveillance schemes developed to detect clusters of tuberculosis as described by Fitzgibbon et al. [8]. Library typing systems that use more stable genotypic markers such as bacterial multilocus sequence typing (MLST) are suitable for strategy-oriented molecular surveillance aimed at monitoring secular trends in the evolution of pathogen genotypes and in their distribu - tion over larger geographic and population scales [1-5]. Such molecular surveillance systems can call attention to the emergence of strains with enhanced virulence or drug resistance, help identify risk factors associated with transmission of specific strains, or predict the effectiveness of public health measures such as vac - cinations. This approach is well established for global virological surveillance of human and avian influenza. As illustrated by an experience from New-Zealand presented by Muellner et al., a nationwide molecular surveillance of campylobacteriosis using a sequential combination of typing systems can inform both disease control measures and prevention policies by detecting local outbreaks and modelling endemic disease attri - bution to specific food sources [4]. Structured sur - veys that combine spatiotemporal mapping of strain genotype and antimicrobial resistance phenotype is a powerful means to monitor the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant clones across a continent, as reported by Chisolm et al. for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Europe [9]. As summarised by Sabat et al., there have been con - tinuous technological improvements for microbial genomic characterisation in the past decade, mov - ing from fingerprinting methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial macrorestriction fragments to more robust, portable and biologically informative assays such as bacterial multilocus var - iable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and sequencing of single/multiple loci of both bacterial and viral human pathogens [3-5,9-11]. With the decreasing cost and continuing refinement of high-throughput 3 www.eurosurveillance.orggenome sequencing technologies, we are now wit - nessing a quantum leap from genotypic epidemiology to genomic epidemiology as whole viral or bacterial genomes become open to scrutiny at population level. As reviewed by Carrico et al., advances in laboratory typing tools have been enabled by parallel progress in the information technology needed to capture genetic data on pathogens, and in quality control, formatting, storage, management and, most importantly, bioinfor - matics analysis and real-time electronic data sharing databases [10]. Among the sequence-based genotyping assays, MLST is for epidemiological investigations of bacterial and fungal pathogens and is a primary typ - ing method for clonal delineation in pathogens such Neisseria advantages MLST are twofold: firstly, it generates reproducible and standardised data that are highly portable (i.e. easily transferrable between different systems) and comparable across laboratories in centralised data - bases accessible through the Internet. Secondly, the nucleotide substitutions that underlie MLST varia - tion can be interpreted directly in terms of population genetics and evolutionary processes. Because nucleo - tide polymorphisms evolve slowly in bacteria, MLST is very appropriate to describe the patterns of genetic variation within bacterial species at the global scale. Therefore, one of the major applications of MLST is to decipher bacterial population structure, including clonal diversity, to create a phylogenetic structure of different lineages and to assess the impact of homolo - gous recombination. Recently, this has led to a bold proposal to replace the 70 year-old serotyping nomen - clature system for Salmonella strains with MLST [13]. To reduce costs and increase speed, typing based on the sequencing of single highly variable genes was developed for a few pathogens. The most widely used systems are sequencing of the emm gene coding for the M antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes (which can be compared to the results from traditional M serotyp - ing) and the spa gene coding for surface protein A of Staphylococcus aureus [5]. However, single locus typing approaches are limited by events such as homoplasy (evolutionary reversion or convergence) and horizontal gene transfer, as discussed by Sabat et al. [5]. Lindstedt et al. show in this issue how interest in MLVA has grown from the limitations of MLST and other meth - ods to discriminate among isolates of epidemiologically important clones, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium [11]. MLVA retains the 'multilocus' concept of MLST but is based on rapidly evolving loci characterised by the presence of short, tandem repeated sequences. MLVA has proven very useful in surveillance and epidemiology, e.g. for moni - toring clonal trends, cluster detection and outbreak investigation [5,11,14]. The high discriminatory power of MLVA for many bacterial groups, combined with its simplicity, makes it an especially useful subtyping tool for so-called monomorphic pathogens [5,11]. In addi MLVA strong potential for inter-laboratory standardisation, and several web-accessible database systems have been developed [5,10-11]. One important drawback is that many MLVA schemes are highly spe - cific for given clones, thus limiting their applicability. Furthermore, for long-term epidemiology or population biology, MLVA markers can be affected by homoplasy, which renders MLVA data less robust than MLST as a library typing system and for phylogenetic purposes. It also remains unclear whether assembly of high throughput sequence data will be reliable enough to determine MLVA alleles, as the repeat arrays pose par - ticular technical challenges for current high throughput sequencing technologies. From a perspective of medical and public health micro - biology and epidemiology, whole genome sequencing (WGS) combines two decisive advantages compared to previous methods: it provides maximal strain dis - crimination on the one hand, and can be linked to clinically and epidemiologically relevant phenotypes on the other hand. The method is widely seen as the ultimate tool for epidemiological typing of bacteria and other pathogens. It has already proven highly informa - tive to resolve local S. aureus outbreaks [6] as well as elucidate the evolutionary events leading to the emer - gence and global dissemination of super-pathogen clones with enhanced virulence and multidrug resist - ance, such as Clostridium difficile ribotype 027 strains [14-15]. Moreover, WGS will provide full genomic char - acteristics of the infectious isolates, including the set of genes linked to antimicrobial resistance (the resistome) and those linked to virulence of the isolates (the virulome). As discussed by several authors in this issue [3,5,10,12,14], WGS still remains to be fully har - nessed conceptually and fine-tuned technologically. This promising technology currently faces three major challenges: speed, data analysis and interpretation, and cost. As opposed to previous sequence-based typing meth - ods, WGS will change the way we look at pathogen diversity in one fundamental way: without an a priori focus on a subset of loci. As all genetic information will be available, it will allow the discovery of novel, unexpected variation, including polymorphisms that evolve during outbreaks or changes that are selected in vivo during infection. Such pathoadaptive changes can result in increased virulence or novel pathophysi - ological processes. One example of such a micro-evo - lutionary change is the emergence during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic of a quasispecies variant with a haemagglutinin D222G mutation which is associated with modified tissue receptor tropism and severe influ - enza virus infections, as reported by Rykkvin et al. in this journal [16]. Due to the rapid rate of evolution of viruses and their small genomes, virologists have long been using genome-wide sequencing. The term 'phylo - dynamics' designates the study of the interplay of epi - demiological and evolutionary patterns, pioneered in 4 www.eurosurveillance.orgvirology [17]. Phylodynamics based on WGS of bacterial populations is emerging as a fertile field of investiga - tion for public health microbiology [5-6,14-15]. As discussed by Jolley and Maiden, WGS sequencing of bacterial pathogens and archiving of the collected data will raise the issue of genomic strain nomenclature [12]. One particularly interesting advantage of MLST in the era of high-throughput sequencing lies in its forward compatibility with future whole genome sequencing, or core genome allotyping, as underlined by Sabat et al. and Jolley and Maiden [5,12]. Several recent tools allow extracting MLST information from high-throughput data [12,18,19]. The BIGSDB bioinformatics application incorporates MLST databases and provides the possibility to extend the MLST approach to include the full core genome [12]. We anticipate that a WGS-based genotype nomenclature could be developed as a complement to the well-established MLST nomen - clature of bacterial clones. As core genome evolution within MLST clones is mainly mutational, the possibil - ity to reconstruct phylogeny based on WGS data should allow a hierarchical classification of WGS types, giving access to different levels of genetic distance resolu - tion depending on the epidemiological questions and length of the study period. This is just one example of the challenges that we face as we enter the exciting era of genomic epidemiology [5,10,12]. Beyond the hurdles in technology and bioinformatics that we still need to overcome, what are the needs for translating advances in genomic epidemiology into public health benefits? Laboratory-based surveillance is pivotal to monitoring infectious disease threats to human health. It relies on aggregating microbiological data that are produced at clinical care level and supple - mented by reference laboratory testing. As highlighted by Niesters et al., molecular methods supplant culture-based diagnostic methods, thereby making genomic information relevant to disease surveillance available at the level of the diagnostic laboratory. This techno - logical shift challenges the hierarchical architecture of surveillance networks that relies on samples and cul - ture specimens being referred from the clinics to the reference laboratories and public health institutes [20]. Niesters et al. describe the pilot experience with the TYPENED surveillance network as a molecular data-sharing platform pioneered in the Netherlands by a consortium of clinics, academic institutions and pub - lic health virology laboratories [20]. This collaborative approach led to a consensus on how to choose surveil - lance targets, harmonise sequence-based virological diagnostic assays and share sequence data through a common platform [20]. In addition to stimulating changes in public health sys - tems, the application of high-resolution typing tools such as WGS in outbreak management raises a number of ethical questions, as discussed by Rump et al. in this journal [21]: protection of personal data, informed con - sent with regard to the investigation of clinical samples, and moral responsibility and legal liability to act upon the evidence to prevent or mitigate disease transmis - sion. As real-time data sharing becomes technically feasible for surveillance and cross-border outbreak investigations, public health organisations will need to develop a policy for the use of these data that balances risks and benefits and defines adequate governance. As part of its mandate to foster collaboration between expert and reference laboratories supporting preven - tion and control of infectious diseases, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and assess - ing public health needs for the integration of microbial genotyping data into surveillance and epidemic prepar - edness at European level [22]. As announced recently, a European data exchange platform that combines typ - ing data with epidemiological data on a list of priority diseases is being piloted for molecular surveillance of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and food-borne pathogens [23]. As WGS gradually becomes part of epidemiological studies, ECDC is party to the international expert consultations aimed at build - ing interoperable databases of microbial genomes for future application in 5 www.eurosurveillance.orgReferences 1.

Traditional typing systems based on phenotypes, such as serotype, biotype, phage-type, or antibiogram, have been used for many years. However, more recent methods that examine the relatedness of isolates at a molecular level have revolutionised our ability to differentiate among bacterial types and subtypes. Importantly, the development of molecular methods has provided new tools for enhanced surveillance and outbreak detection. This has resulted in better imple - mentation of rational infection control programmes and efficient allocation of resources across Europe. The emergence of benchtop sequencers using next gen - eration sequencing technology makes bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) feasible even in small research and clinical laboratories. WGS has already been used for the characterisation of bacterial isolates in several large outbreaks in Europe and, in the near future, is likely to replace currently used typing meth - odologies due to its ultimate resolution. However, WGS is still too laborious and time-consuming to obtain useful data in routine surveillance. Also, a largely unresolved question is how genome sequences must be examined for epidemiological characterisation. In the coming years, the lessons learnt from currently used molecular methods will allow us to condense the WGS data into epidemiologically useful informa - tion. On this basis, we have reviewed current and new molecular typing methods for outbreak detection and epidemiological surveillance of bacterial pathogens in clinical practice, aiming to give an overview of their specific advantages and disadvantages. Introduction Identifying different types of organisms within a spe - cies is called typing. Traditional typing systems based on phenotype, such as serotype, biotype, phage-type or antibiogram, have been used for many years. However, the methods that examine the relatedness of isolates at a molecular level have revolutionised our ability to differentiate among bacterial types (or subtypes). The choice of an appropriate molecular typing method (or methods) depends significantly on the problem to solve and the epidemiological context in which the method is going to be used, as well as the time and geographi - cal scale of its use. Importantly, human pathogens of one species can comprise very diverse organisms. Therefore, typing techniques should have excellent typeability to be able to type all the isolates studied [1]. In outbreak investigations, a typing method must have the discriminatory power needed to distinguish all epidemiologically unrelated isolates. Ideally, such a method can discriminate very closely related isolates to reveal person-to-person strain transmission, which is important to develop strategies to prevent further spread. At the same time it must be rapid, inexpensive, highly reproducible, and easy to perform and interpret [1,2]. When typing is applied for continuous surveil - lance, the respective method must yield results with adequate stability over time to allow implementation of efficient infection control measures. Moreover, a typing method that is going to be used in international networks should produce data that are portable (i.e. easily transferrable between different systems) and that can be easily accessed via an open source web-based database, or a client-server database connected via the Internet. Additionally, a typing method used for surveillance should rely on an internationally stand - ardised nomenclature, and it should be applicable for a broad range of bacterial species. There should also 7 www.eurosurveillance.orgbe procedures in place to check and validate, by using quantifiable internal and external controls, that the typing data are of high quality. A clear advantage for a typing approach is the availability of software that: (i) enables automated quality control of raw typing data, (ii) allows pattern/type assignment, (iii) implements an algorithm for clustering of isolates based on the obtained data, (iv) provides assistance in the detection of outbreaks of infections, and (v) facilitates data man - agement and storage. To date, many different molecu - lar methods for epidemiological characterisation of bacterial isolates have been developed. However, none of them is optimal for all forms of investigation. Thus, a thorough understanding of the advantages and limi - tations of the available typing methods is of crucial importance for selecting the appropriate approaches to unambiguously define outbreak strains. Here, we present an overview of the typing methods that are currently used in bacterial disease outbreak investigations and active surveillance networks, and we specify their advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, we focus on those methods that have the strongest impact on public health, or for which there is a growing interest in relation to clinical use. PubMed database searches To investigate the impact of typing methods in public health, we first queried the PubMed database using a combination of specific keywords to retrieve the rel - evant articles without any constraints on the time of publication. Furthermore, in order to reveal a growing interest in particular typing methods, we subsequently restrictively searched PubMed for articles published between January 2010 and the present day (as of 1 December 2012). We considered a method as a method of growing interest when the number of articles pub - lished between January 2010 and the present day was higher than the number of articles published before 2010. Specifically, an electronic search was conducted using the following combinations [AND] typing. Also, to identify the impact of particular typing meth - ods on outbreak investigations currently conducted, we searched the PubMed database with a restriction to articles published between January 2011 and the pre - sent day, using the following combinations of [AND] outbreak. The results of these literature searches have been included in the following sections of this review that address the respective typing methods. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been con - sidered as the 'gold standard' among molecular typing methods for a variety of clinically important bacteria. When 'PFGE AND typing' were used as search terms, over 2,700 publications were retrieved in PubMed, which underscores the major influence and importance of this method in the field. For most bacterial species, the technique was adopted as an epidemiological tool in the 1990s [3-6]. Today, it is still the most frequently used approach to characterise bacterial isolates in outbreaks [7,8] as revealed by a PubMed database search with a restriction to articles published between January 2011 and the present day. In total, 183 hits were obtained for the terms 'PFGE AND outbreak', while searches for all other methods in combination with the term 'outbreak' invariably resulted in less than 100 hits. For many years, PFGE has been a primary typing tool to analyse centre-to-centre transmission events, and it has been used successfully in large-scale epi - demiological investigations [9]. The success of PFGE results from its excellent discriminatory power and high epidemiological concordance. Moreover, it is a relatively inexpensive approach with excellent type - ability and intra-laboratory reproducibility. In the past decade, protocols for PFGE have been standardised and inter-laboratory comparison has been undertaken through several initiatives, such as PulseNet [10] or Harmony [11]. It has also been possible to establish international fingerprinting databases, which allowed fast detection of emerging clones and monitoring of the spread of pathogenic bacterial strains through dif - ferent regions or countries. To perform PFGE, a highly purified genomic DNA sample is cleaved with a restric - tion endonuclease that recognises infrequently occur - ring restriction sites in the genome of the respective bacterial species. The resulting restriction fragments, which are mostly large, can be separated on an aga - rose gel by 'pulsed-field' electrophoresis in which the orientation of the electric field across the gel is changed periodically. The separated DNA fragments can be visualised on the gel as bands, which form a particular pattern on the gel, the PFGE pattern. For most bacteria PFGE can resolve DNA fragments with sizes ranging from about 30 kb to over 1 Mb [12]. Large restriction fragments are thus separated in a size-dependent manner and the method yields relatively few bands on the gel, which makes analysis of the results easier. A clear advantage of the PFGE method is that it addresses a large portion of an investigated genome (>90%). Accordingly, insertions or deletions of mobile genetic elements as well as large recombination events within genomic DNA will result in changes in the PFGE patterns. Usually, plasmid DNA does not interfere with the macrorestriction profiles of the chromosomal DNA, which is responsible for the particular PFGE pat - tern, as the fragments generated by restriction of plas - mid DNA are too small to affect the profile. However, 8 www.eurosurveillance.orgin some bacteria, differences in the carriage of large plasmids (over 50 kb) have been observed as single-band differences between the respective PFGE profiles [12]. Unfortunately, although widely used, PFGE suf - fers from several limitations. The method is technically demanding, labour-intensive and time-consuming, and it may lack the resolution power to distinguish bands of nearly identical size (i.e. fragments differing from each other in size by less than 5%). Moreover, the analysis of PFGE results is prone to some subjectivity and the continuous quality control and portability of data are limited compared to sequence-based methods. Amplified fragment length polymorphism In the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method, genomic DNA is cut with two restriction enzymes, and double-stranded adaptors are specifi - cally ligated to one of the sticky ends of the restriction fragments [13]. Subsequently, the restriction fragments ending with the adaptor are selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers comple - mentary to the adaptor sequence, the restriction site sequence and a number of additional nucleotides (usu - ally 1-3 nucleotides) from the end of the unknown DNA template. At the start of the amplification, highly strin - gent conditions are used to ensure efficient binding of primers to fully complementary nucleotide sequences of the template. AFLP allows the specific co-amplifica - tion of high numbers (typically between 50 and 100) of restriction fragments and is often carried out with fluo - rescent dye-labeled PCR primers. This allows to detect the fragments once they have been separated by size on an automated DNA sequencer. A subsequent com - puter-assisted comparison of high-resolution banding patterns generated during the AFLP analysis enables the determination of genetic relatedness among stud - ied bacterial isolates [14]. AFLP has been described as being at least as discriminatory as PFGE [15]. In addi - tion, AFLP is a reproducible approach and like other DNA banding pattern-based methods it can be auto - mated [16] and results are portable. The major limita - tions of AFLP include the fact that it is labour-intensive (a typical analysis takes about three days), and the kits for extraction of the total DNA, enzymes, fluorescence detection systems and adaptors are expensive. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is based on the parallel amplification of a set of frag - ments by using short arbitrary sequences as prim - ers (usually 10 bases) that target several unspecified genomic sequences. Amplification is conducted at a low, non-stringent annealing temperature, which allows the hybridisation of multiple mismatched sequences. When the distance between two primer binding sites on both DNA strands is within the range of 0.1-3 kb, an amplicon can be generated that covers the sequence between these two binding sites. Importantly, the number and the positions of primer binding sites are unique to a particular bacterial strain. RAPD amplicons can be analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis or DNA sequencing depending on the labeling of primers with appropriate fluorescent dyes. Although, less dis - criminatory than PFGE, RAPD has been widely used for the typing of bacterial isolates in cases of outbreaks [17,18], because it is simple, inexpensive, rapid and easy in use. The main drawback of the RAPD method is its low intra-laboratory reproducibility since very low annealing temperatures are used. Moreover, RAPD lacks inter-laboratory reproducibility since it is sensi - tive to subtle differences in reagents, protocols, and machines. Arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) is a variant of the orig - inal RAPD method, and it is therefore often referred to as RAPD [19]. The differences between the AP-PCR and RAPD protocols involve several technical details. In AP-PCR: (i) the amplification is conducted in three parts, each with its own stringency and concentra - tion of components, (ii) high primer concentrations are used in the first PCR cycles, and (iii) primers of vari - able length and often designed for other purposes are used. Consequently, the advantages and limitations of AP-PCR are identical to those of RAPD, as pointed out above. Repetitive-element polymerase chain reaction Repetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR) is based on genomic fingerprint patterns to classify bacterial isolates. The rep-PCR method uses primers that hybridise to non-coding intergenic repetitive sequences scattered across the genome. DNA between adjacent repetitive ele - ments is amplified using PCR and multiple amplicons can be produced, depending on the distribution of the repeat elements across the genome. The sizes of these amplicons are then electrophoretically characterised, and the banding patterns are compared to determine the genetic relatedness between the analysed bacte - rial isolates. Multiple families of repeat sequences have been used successfully for rep-PCR typing, such as the 'enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus' the 'BOX' sequences [20]. As this typing approach is based on PCR amplification and subsequent DNA electrophoresis, the results of rep-PCR can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. This is also the rea - son why this approach is very cheap. For many bacte - rial organisms rep-PCR can be highly discriminatory [21,22]. The main limitation of rep-PCR combined with electrophoresis using traditional agarose gels is that it lacks sufficient reproducibility, which may result from variability in reagents and gel electrophoresis systems. The DiversiLab system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) is a semiautomated method using the rep-PCR approach. We mention it here, because it is used in local infection control settings by a number of hospi - tals worldwide. In this case, commercial PCR kits have been developed for a series of clinically important 9 www.eurosurveillance.orgmicroorganisms [23]. After PCR, amplified genomic DNA regions between separated by the DiversiLab system to sub - stantially increase resolution and reproducibility of the rep-PCR approach in comparison to traditional gel electrophoresis. The resulting data are automatically collected, normalised and analysed by the DiversiLab software. A number of studies have evaluated the use - fulness of DiversiLab by comparing its performance with current standard typing methods using well-char - acterised collections of outbreak-related and epide - miologically unrelated bacterial isolates [24-26]. These studies have shown that the DiversiLab system is sim - ple, easy to perform, rapid, reproducible, endowed with full typeability and applicable to a wide range of microorganisms. The authors concluded that for most bacterial species, in case of a suspected outbreak in hospital settings, DiversiLab is useful especially in first-line outbreak detection. In particular, Fluit and col - leagues [25] have shown that DiversiLab is a useful tool for identification of hospital outbreaks Enterococcus faecium , and methicillin-resistant DiversiLab can be insuffi - ciently discriminative for typing some bacterial species, including MRSA, in outbreak settings was confirmed by Babouee et al. [27]. The results obtained by Overdevest and colleagues [26], who evaluated the performance of DiversiLab, were also in line with the findings reported by Fluit et al. [25], except for the conclusions regard - ing P. aeruginosa. Deplano and colleagues [24] have demonstrated excellent epidemiological concordance of the results produced by DiversiLab by correctly linking all outbreak-related However, they also recommended that for E. coli isolates with the same DiversiLab type, the results should be con - firmed by testing additional markers [24]. The total cost of all consumables and reagents for DiversiLab is comparable to that of PFGE, amounting in euros (EUR) to about EUR 20 per isolate. By checking the PubMed database using 'DiversiLab AND typing' as the search term, 63 publications were retrieved of which 48 were dated after the end of 2009. This indicates a grow - ing interest in the use of DiversiLab as a typing tool. However, as the inter-laboratory reproducibility of rep-PCR approaches is generally limited, large-scale intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility studies should be carefully performed to further evaluate the usefulness of the DiversiLab system for regional and eventually national surveillance of bacterial genotypes. Moreover, the DiversiLab database is housed on a manufacturer server, which prevents some potential users from using this typing system because of concerns with data security issues.Variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing Bacterial genomes possess many regions with nucleo - tide repeats in coding and non-coding DNA sequences. When these repeats are directly adjacent to each other and their number at the same locus varies between isolates, the respective genomic regions are called var - iable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci. The repeats at the same locus can be identical or their nucleotide sequences can differ slightly. Multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA) is a method which determines the number of tandem repeat sequences at different loci in a bacte - rial genome. VNTR loci are multiplex PCR and an analysis of the amplicons is conducted on standard agarose gels [28]. An advantage of this simple but also cheap, fast and easy to use assay is that the whole procedure can be performed in labo - ratories without sophisticated electrophoresis equip - ment. When MLVA does not enable a convenient and unambiguous calculation of the individual numbers of repeats per locus, some investigators call it multiple- locus VNTR fingerprinting (MLVF) [21,29]. A drawback of MLVF is that the resulting data cannot be compared directly between different laboratories. This is due to the fact that the generated amplicons are monitored as banding patterns by conventional electrophoresis on low-resolution agarose gels. Such analyses do not reveal the exact numbers of repeats in the obtained amplicons and it is also impossible to determine which band in a pattern corresponds to which PCR target. A better separation of the amplified DNA fragments by size during electrophoresis has been achieved by replacement of standard agarose gels with a microflu - idic chip-based analysis on a fully integrated miniatur - ised instrument. In 2005, Francois and colleagues [30] reported on the use of automated microfluidic electro - phoresis with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer 'lab-on-a-chip' for the VNTR typing of S. aureus isolates. Since then, there have been a growing number of studies that have shown the clear advantage of microfluidic chips over the standard agarose gels for the MLVA/MLVF typ - ing in terms of electrophoretic separation resolution, reproducibility, rapidity and automated data analysis [31,32]. For inter-laboratory comparison, the exact number of repeat units in each MLVA locus must be determined. From the size of a particular PCR product and the known length of a single repeat and the flanking consensus regions to which primers were designed, the number of repeated units at each locus can be calculated. The use of capillary electrophoresis on an automatic DNA sequencer and the labeling of primers with different fluorescently coloured dyes allows MLVA amplicons to be analysed in one run and still be typed individually [33,34]. The different fluorophore molecules incorpo - rated in the amplicons absorb the laser energy and release light of different wavelengths, which are then identified by the detector in the DNA sequencer. Using computer software, all loci are distinctly recognised 10 www.eurosurveillance.orgon electropherograms according to their colours, and based on their amplicon sizes, the repeat number per MLVA locus is calculated automatically. Moreover, the determination of amplicon sizes using a DNA sequencer is conducted much more precisely than when agarose gels or microfluidic chips are used. Once the number of repeats in a set of VNTR loci (alleles) for a bacterial isolate is assessed, an ordered string of allele numbers corresponding to the number of repeat units at each MLVA locus results in an allelic profile (e.g. 7-12-3-3-22-11-6-1), which can be easily compared to reference databases via the Internet. The intrinsic limitation of MLVA is that it is not a univer - sal method, meaning that primers need to be designed specifically for each pathogenic species targeted. This is the major reason why it cannot replace PFGE in epi - demiological investigations in general. Furthermore, MLVA is not 100% reproducible unless the allele ampli - cons are sequenced and the users have agreed on where the VNTR begins and ends for each locus. For improved reproducibility MLVA, single of VNTR loci instead of multiplex reactions can be conducted. However, this approach increases the assay time and its costs. Separation by size of ampli - cons is not reproducible when using different sequenc - ers, polymers, or fluorescent labels. The size difference in a VNTR locus may not always reflect the real number of tandem repeats, because insertions, deletions or duplications in the amplified region can also give rise to the same size difference. Therefore, sequencing of the amplicons is necessary in this case. Importantly, MLVA has not yet been fully developed and properly validated for use in surveillance networks dedicated to clinically relevant organisms as is underscored by the fact that multiple protocols have been published that still remain to be carefully validated. An alternative strategy for epidemiological typing is the measurement of variations in the VNTR regions by DNA sequencing. Methods relying on sequence varia - tions in multiple VNTR regions have been developed for the AND typing' were used as a search term in PubMed, about 1,000 publications were retrieved from PubMed, showing that VNTR-based typing approaches are of major importance in the field. Single locus sequence typing Single locus sequence typing (SLST) is used to deter - mine the relationships among bacterial isolates based on the comparison of sequence variations in a single target gene. The terminology SLST has been borrowed from the better known approach called multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (see below) in which several genes are characterised by DNA sequencing to deter - mine genetic relatedness among the isolates. Typing based on the M-protein found on the surface of group A Streptococcus (GAS) has been the most widely used method for distinguishing GAS isolates [38]. The M-protein, encoded by the emm gene, is the major virulence and immunological determinant of this human-specific pathogen. In recent years, the classic M-protein serological typing was largely replaced by sequencing of the hypervariable region located at the 5'end of the emm gene [39]. The emm -typing method has become the gold-standard of GAS molecular typ - ing for surveillance and epidemiological purposes, and more than 200 emm types have been described so far. Nevertheless, in order to fully discriminate GAS clones, emm -typing should be complemented with other typ like PFGE or MLST [40,41]. Nucleotide sequencing of the short the flagellin B gene ( flaB ) provides adequate information for the study of Campylobacter epidemiol - ogy. Although PFGE remains the most discriminatory typing method for Campylobacter , a study conducted by Mellmann and colleagues [42] showed that sequenc - ing of the SVR region of flaB is a rapid, reproducible, discriminatory and stable screening tool. It was also found that flaB sequence-typing is useful in combina - tion with other typing methods such as MLST to differ - entiate closely related or outbreak isolates [43]. When ' emm OR flab AND typing' were used as a search term in PubMed, 238 hits were retrieved, which shows the importance of this method for the typing of GAS and Campylobacter isolates. Staphylococcus aureus protein A gene-typing The most widely used method of the SLST group is called S. aureus protein A gene ( spa)-typing, because it involves the sequencing of the polymorphic X region of the protein A gene of S. aureus . Molecular typing of S. aureus isolates on the basis of the protein A gene polymorphism was the first bacterial typing method based on repeat sequence analysis [44]. The high degree of genetic diversity in the VNTR region of the spa gene results not only from a variable number of short repeats (24 bp), but also from various point mutations. In the spa sequence typing method, each identified repeat is associated to a code and a spa- type is deduced from the order of specific repeats. Although spa- typing has a lower discriminatory ability than PFGE [45,46], its cost-effectiveness, ease of use, speed, excellent reproducibility, appropriate in vivo and in vitro stability, standardised international nomenclature, high-throughput by using the StaphType software, and full portability of data via the Ridom database (http://spaserver.ridom.de) makes this method the currently most useful instrument for characterising S. aureus isolates at the local, national and international lev - els [47-52]. Importantly, this approach ensures strict criteria for internal and external quality assurance of data submitted to the database that is curated by SeqNet.org [50,53]. Furthermore, the implementation 11 www.eurosurveillance.orgof the based upon repeat patterns (BURP) algorithm to the StaphType software has greatly facilitated the assignment of spa- types into clonal complexes and singletons. Nevertheless, spa- typing has also certain disadvantages. The major drawback of this method based on single-locus typing is that it can misclassify particular types due to recombination and/or homo - plasy. When ' spa AND typing' were used as a search term in PubMed, 548 hits were retrieved, which high - lights the importance of this method for the typing of S. aureus isolates. Moreover, 341 of the respective publications were dated after the end of 2009, showing that spa- typing is gaining an increasing influence. Multilocus sequence typing In order to overcome the lack or poor portability of traditional and older molecular typing approaches, the MLST method has been invented. MLST is based on the principles of phenotypic multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) [54], which relies on the differ - ences in electrophoretic mobility of different enzymes present in a bacterium. The first MLST scheme was developed for Neisseria meningitidis in 1998 [55]. Shortly thereafter, the method was extended to other bacterial species and, over time, it has become a very popular tool for global epidemiological studies, and for studies on the molecular evolution of pathogens [56-66]. Accordingly, a PubMed search with the term 'MLST AND typing' yielded 1,485 hits. In MLST, internal sequences (of approximatively 450-500 bp) of mostly seven housekeeping genes are amplified by PCR and sequenced. For each locus, unique sequences (alleles) are assigned arbitrary numbers and, based on the combination of identified alleles (i.e. the 'allelic pro - file'), the sequence type (ST) is determined. The num - ber of nucleotide differences between alleles is not considered. The great advantage of MLST is that all data produced by this method are unambiguous due to an internationally standardised nomenclature, and highly reproducible. Moreover, the allele sequences and ST profiles are available in large central databases (http://pubmlst.org and www.mlst.net) that can be queried via the Internet. These databases also provide on-line software (eBURST) for determination of the genetic relatedness between bacterial strains within a species as well as MLST-maps to track the isolates of each ST that have been recovered from each coun - try plus the details of these isolates. The great disad - vantage of MLST is its high cost. The total costs of all consumables and reagents for MLST greatly depend on the number of loci investigated and the country in which this typing procedure is conducted. We estimate that in Member States of the European Union, the total costs of an MLST analysis based on seven loci amount to about EUR 50 per isolate. In contrast, the total costs of MLVF performed with an Agilent BioAnalyzer, MLVA with a DNA sequencer, or SLST merely amount to about EUR 2, EUR 8 and EUR 8 per isolate, respectively [32]. Moreover, MLST is labour-intensive, time-consuming and for some pathogens insufficiently discriminating for routine use in outbreak investigations and local surveillance. To increase the discriminatory power of the 'classical' MLST schemes based on seven house - keeping genes, the sequencing results for particular antigen-encoding genes can be included in the analysis. This is exemplified, by the two-locus sequence typing (Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing, NG-MAST) approach developed for N. gonorrhoeae , which includes two of the most variable gonococcal genes, namely por and tbpB [67]. Another example is the MLST approach developed for Salmonella enterica in which two housekeeping genes, gyrB and atpD , in combination with the flagellin genes fliC and fljB were applied [68]. Moreover, attempts have been under - taken to develop MLST schemes that are entirely based on virulence genes. Such approaches, termed multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST), have been applied for the monocytogenes enterica S. [69-72]. Altogether, the currently available data sug - gest that MVLST is endowed with a higher discrimina - tory power than that of the 'classical' MLST. However, for most of the MVLST approaches, additional research is needed. This should involve different and larger sets of isolates, and the results should also be correlated with conventional epidemiological data in order to validate the applicability of MVLST for epidemiological typing. Comparative genomic hybridisation A DNA microarray used for typing studies is a collection of DNA probes attached in an ordered fashion to a solid surface. These probes can be used to detect the pres - ence of complementary nucleotide sequences in par - ticular bacterial isolates. Thus, microarrays represent facile tools for detecting genes that serve as markers for specific bacterial strains, or to detect allelic variants of a gene that is present in all strains of a particular spe - cies. The probes on the array may be PCR amplicons (> 200 bp) or oligonucleotides (up to 70 mers). Depending on the number of probes placed on a solid surface, we can distinguish low-density (hundreds of probes) and high-density (hundreds of thousands of probes) DNA microarrays. In the usual approach, total DNA is extracted from a pathogen of interest. This target DNA is then labeled, either chemically or by an enzymatic reaction, and hybridised to a DNA microarray. Unbound target DNA is removed during subsequent washing steps of different stringency, and the signal from a suc - cessful hybridisation event between the labeled target DNA and an immobilised probe is measured automati - cally by a scanner. The data produced by a microarray assay are then analysed using dedicated software to assess the bacterial diversity. The results retrieved from array technology are variable and depend on the customised array. DNA microarrays appear to be very well suited for bacterial typing as is underscored by the 506 PubMed hits with the search terms 'microar - rays OR microarray AND typing'. Microarrays are cur - rently widely used to analyse genomic mutations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addi - tion, microarray technology is an efficient tool for the 12 www.eurosurveillance.orgdetection of extra-genomic elements [73,74]. Through microarray-based gene content analyses, pathogens can be simultaneously genotyped and profiled to determine their antimicrobial resistance and virulence potential. Importantly, such a high-density whole genome microarray approach comprises probes allow - ing for the detection of the open reading frame (ORF) content of one or many genomes. Comparative genom - ics by using whole genome microarrays has revealed that 10 major S. aureus lineages are responsible for the majority of infections in humans [75]. The application of very recently developed microarrays (Sam-62) based on 62 S. aureus whole genome sequencing (WGS) pro - jects and 153 plasmid sequences has shown that MRSA transmission events unrecognised by other approaches can be identified using microarray profiling, which is capable of distinguishing between extremely similar but non-identical sequences [73]. Also, a high-density Affymetrix DNA microarray platform based on all ORFs identified on 31 chromosomes and 46 plasmids from a diverse set of E. coli and Shigella isolates has been applied to quickly determine the presence or absence of genes in very recently emerged E. coli O104:H4 and related isolates [76]. This genome-scale genotyping has thus revealed a clear discrimination between clini - cally, temporally, and geographically distinct O104:H4 isolates. The authors have therefore concluded [76] that the whole genome microarray approach is a useful alternative for WGS to save time, effort and expenses, and it can be used in real-time outbreak investiga - tions. However, the application of high-density micro - arrays for bacterial typing in routine laboratories is currently hindered by the high costs of materials and the specialised equipment needed for the tests. Alere Technologies has therefore developed a rapid and economic microarray assay for diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigations. The assay was minia - turised to a microtitre strip format (ArrayStrips) allow - ing simultaneous testing of eight to up to 96 samples. The Alere StaphyType DNA microarray for S. aureus covers 334 target sequences, including approximately 170 distinct genes and their allelic variants [77]. Ninety six arrays are scanned on the reader and the affilia - tion of S. aureus isolates to particular genetic lineages is done automatically by software based on hybridi - sation profiles. With the ArrayStrips, the ArrayTube Platform as a single test format is also available for a number of bacterial species. Interestingly, the total cost of an Alere microarray test per bacterial isolate is comparable to that of PFGE (about EUR 20-30) and much lower than that of MLST (EUR 50). The whole typ - ing procedure for 96 isolates can be conducted within two working days. Recently, Alere Technologies has also developed genotyping DNA microarray kits for other bacterial species, such as E. coli, P. aeruginosa , L. pneumophila , and Chlamydia trachomatis . available data show that microarray-based tech - nologies are highly accurate. However, the reproduc - ibility of microarray data within and between different laboratories needs to be established prior to the broad application of this technology. In particular, if SNPs are the target for typing of highly clonal species, then DNA microarray analysis is probably not the best method to apply. Moreover, arrays have the major disadvantage that they do not allow the identification of sequences which are not included in the array. Classical serotyping involves a few days to achieve final conclusive results. It requires a major set of costly anti - sera, is expensive and tedious so that its use is usually restricted to only a few reference laboratories. These technical difficulties can be overcome with molecular serotyping methods. Accordingly, Alere Technologies has developed fast DNA Serotyping assays based on oligonucleotide microarrays for C. The microarray assay for C. trachomatis includes a set of oligonucleo - tide probes designed to exploit multiple discrimina - tory sites located in variable domains 1, 2 and 4 of the ompA gene encoding the major outer membrane pro - tein A. In case of E. coli and S. enterica , separate approaches have been developed, but in both these assays the genes encoding the O and H antigens have been selected as target sequences. After multiplex amplification of the selected DNA target sequences using biotinylated primers, the samples are hybridised to the microarray probes under highly stringent condi - tions. The resulting signals yield genotype (serovar)-specific hybridisation profiles. Optical mapping Optical maps from single genomic DNA molecules were first described for a pathogenic bacterium in the year 2001 [80]. They were constructed for E. coli O157:H7 to facilitate genome assembly by an accurate alignment of contigs generated from the large number of short sequencing reads and to validate the sequence data. Optical mapping, also called whole genome mapping, is now a proven approach to search for diversity among bacterial isolates. Moreover, optical mapping can be coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to effec - tively and accurately close the gaps between sequence scaffolds in de novo genome sequencing projects. The system creates ordered, genome-wide, high-resolution restriction maps using randomly selected individual DNA molecules [81]. High molecular weight DNA is obtained from gently lysed cells embedded in low-melt - ing-point agarose. The purified DNA is subsequently stretched on a microfluidic device. Following digestion with a selected restriction endonuclease, the result - ing molecule fragments remain attached to the surface of the microfluidic device in the same order as they appear in the genome. The genomic DNA is then stained with an intercalating fluorescent dye and visualised by fluorescence microscopy. The lengths of the restric - tion fragments are measured by fluorescence inten - sity. Finally, using specialised software, the consensus genomic optical map is assembled by overlapping mul - tiple single molecule maps. Whole chromosome opti - cal maps can be created for a few organisms within 13 www.eurosurveillance.orgtwo days. Due to a very high accuracy and resolution potential, optical mapping has been used successfully in retrospective outbreak investigations to examine the genetic relatedness among isolates of several bacterial species [82-84]. Mellmann and colleagues [85] created for the first time whole chromosome optical maps in real-time outbreak investigations for the E. coli isolates recovered from patients in hospitals located in four dif - ferent German cities during the 2011 outbreak of E. coli O104:H4. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that optical mapping is a very powerful tool to assess the genetic relationships among bacterial isolates. However, the use of this technique is currently limited by the high costs of the experiments and the special - ised equipment needed. Whole genome sequencing NGS has transformed genetic investigations by pro - viding a cost-effective way to discover genome-wide variations. These NGS technologies are also known as 'second generation sequencing', or 'high-throughput sequencing'. The terms next generation or second generation sequencing are used to distinguish these approaches from the first generation sequencing approaches based on the Sanger method. The clear advantage of NGS over traditional Sanger sequencing is the ability to generate millions of reads (approxi - mately 35-700 bp in length) in single runs at compara - tively low costs. To construct the complete nucleotide sequence of a genome, multiple short sequence reads must be assembled based on overlapping regions (de novo assembly), or comparisons with previously sequenced 'reference' genomes (resequencing). WGS is becoming a powerful and highly attractive tool for epidemiological investigations [85-88] and it is highly likely that in the near future WGS technology for rou - tine clinical use will permit accurate identification and characterisation of bacterial isolates. However, the key challenge will not be to produce the sequence data, but to rapidly compute and interpret the relevant information from large data sets. Ideally, this infor - mation should include and therefore enable a direct comparison to the results obtained by conventional typing methods (e.g. PFGE, MLST), and it should be stored in globally accessible databases. However, the reads produced by the NGS technologies are relatively short, which can make the de novo genome assembly a challenging enterprise. Accordingly, the term 'whole genome sequence' refers often to only approximately 90% of the entire genome. The gaps between assem - bled regions (contigs) are mainly caused by the pres - ence of dispersed or tandemly arrayed repeats. As current NGS sequencing platforms do not resolve such VNTRs very well, it is often difficult or even impossible to extract useful information on repeats in the MLVA loci from the available genome sequences. Also, for an in silico restriction digest to simulate PFGE, there is a need to close completely the gaps between the contigs to obtain one long, contiguous sequence. Therefore, PFGE profiles cannot be predicted without closing the genome sequences, and on top of this it is necessary to know how different restriction sites used for PFGE are methylated in an organism of interest. To improve de novo genome assembly, the introduc - tion of new platforms that generate much longer reads is needed. Recently, a 'third-generation sequencer' (PacBio) was launched by Pacific Biosciences, which generates very long reads with average lengths of 2-3 kb, and reads of more than 7 kb are not uncom - mon with this system. Furthermore, approximately 100 kb reads are generated by nanopore sequencing technologies as developed by Oxford Nanopore. The main limitations of these third-generation sequencing approaches are their very high costs and low accu - racy (approximately 15% error rate). However, further improvements are promised by Pacific Biosystems and Oxford Nanopore to generate long sequence reads with much higher accuracy [89]. The costs of bacterial WGS by NGS continue to decline. Currently, a price level has been reached that comes close to the price of an MLST analysis carried out by traditional Sanger sequencing reactions. Thus, the sequencing cost in United States (US) dollars (USD) of a bacterial genome using NGS can be as little as USD 100-150 per isolate (which amounts to EUR 75-110), including sample preparation, library quality control (quantification and size assessment), and sequencing [90,91]. Not surprisingly, there is an increasing inter - est in the replacement of PCR/Sanger sequencing with high-throughput deep sequencing technologies, such as 454-pyrosequencing, Illumina and the Ion Torrent system yielding large numbers of short and high-qual - ity reads. Desktop model sequencers are within the financial reach of many, if not all, reference laboratories. However, the procedure is still too slow, and the genome assembly too complicated for implementation in routine surveil - lance, as NGS requires heavy computer resources and the help of well-trained bioinformaticians. On the other hand, Windows-based software (e.g. Bionumerics and Lasergene) that does not require deep insights into bioinformatics for assembling the sequenced genomes and query them against reference genomes or other sequences is just around the corner. An important pre - requisite for the effective application of WGS technolo - gies in the typing of microorganisms is the availability of novel web-accessible bioinformatics platforms for rapid data processing and analysis. Moreover, these bioinformatics tools should be simple enough for use in clinical settings. This is highly feasible as exempli - fied by the convenient web-based method for MLST of 66 bacterial species that was developed by Larsen et al. [92]. This method utilises short sequence reads or reassembled genomes for identifying MLST sequence types, and it is publicly available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MLST. The great advantage of MLST based on seven house - keeping genes is that this method is fully standardised 14 www.eurosurveillance.orgfor numerous bacterial species. However, a very sig - nificant amount of genomic information, including DNA sequence and gene content diversity, exists outside of the genes targeted by traditional MLST. Therefore, to be more effective in the characterisation of outbreak isolates and to strengthen the surveillance systems for particular pathogens, higher resolution methods which utilise WGS are urgently needed. This view is critically underscored by the outbreak of a multidrug-resistant enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O104:H4 infection causing a number of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which occurred in Germany in the period between May and June 2011 [85,93]. This out - break resulted in the death of 46 people and more than 4,000 diseased patients [94]. Before the outbreak in 2011, only one case of HUS associated with E. coli O104:H4, which took place in 2001, had been reported in Germany [85,95]. The traditional MLST typing based on sequence determination of seven housekeeping genes revealed that both the historical isolate recov - ered in 2001 and an isolate originating from a HUS patient during the outbreak in 2011 had the same MLST type 678. This indicated that both isolates were closely related. However, in this case, MLST was not able to reveal major differences between the outbreak isolate and the earlier isolate as became clearly evident upon their characterisation by NGS. Strikingly, the WGS data revealed that the isolate originating from the 2011 outbreak differed substantially from the 2001 isolate in chromosomal and plasmid content [85]. An inde - pendent study by Hao and colleagues [96] confirmed these results as the analysis of E. coli O104:H4 ST678 isolates (one of them was epidemiologically linked to the 2011 outbreak) showed that traditional MLST can - not accurately resolve relationships among genetically related isolates that differ in their pathogenic poten - tials. Using the WGS data they found in 167 genes an evidence of homologous recombination between dis - tantly related E. coli isolates, including the 2011 out - break isolate [96]. We are convinced that in the near future WGS will become a highly powerful tool for outbreak investi - gations and surveillance schemes in routine clinical practice. However, this will require standard operating procedures for identifying variations by examining sim - ilarities and differences between bacterial genomes over time. A way forward seems to be the development of a genome-wide gene-by-gene analysis tool. To this end, two approaches can be used. The first approach would involve an extended MLST (eMLST). However, instead of the traditional MLST based on seven genes, the eMLST method would be based on the whole core genome including all genes present in all isolates of a species. An allelic profile produced by eMLST would then be composed of hundreds to thousands of dif - ferent alleles depending on the genome size of the investigated species. A second 'pan-genome approach' would use the full complement of genes in a species, including the core genome, the dispensable genome that represents a pool of genetic material that may be found in a variable number of isolates within this spe - cies, and the unique genes specific to single strains of the species. In this approach, the relatedness of iso - lates would be measured by the presence or absence of genes across all genomes within a species. Such core- and pan-genome approaches will be endowed with a much higher discriminatory power than that of the traditional MLST, allowing the discrimination of very closely related isolates. However, to use these approaches for bacterial typing, comparative genom - ics must first determine the core, dispensable and unique genes among bacterial genomes at the species level. This process can be greatly facilitated by the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) comparator, and the software implemented within the web accessible PubMLST database (http://pubmlst.org/software/database/bigsdb/), which was created to store and compare sequence data for bacterial isolates [97]. Any number of sequences, from a single sequence read to whole genome data generated from NGS tech - nologies, can be linked to an unlimited number of bac - terial sequences. Within BIGSdb, large numbers of loci can be defined and allelic profiles for each bacterial isolate can be determined with levels of discrimina - tion chosen on the basis of the question being asked. In this way, WGS can probably replace MLST and other typing methods currently in use. As soon as the cost of WGS comes further down and it becomes possible to perform the sequencing and analysis in <24 hours, the method will be highly useful for real-time outbreak surveillance and will likely take over as the first line surveillance typing method in any setting. Although most typing approaches were developed to detect the presence or absence of genetic polymor - phisms inside protein-encoding ORF sequences, impor - tant differences in nucleotide sequences between different bacterial strains of a species can also be observed in intergenic regions. In Europe, the predomi - nant method for Clostridium difficile typing is PCR-ribotyping, which requires the PCR amplification of the intergenic space region between the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes. This method yields an appropri - ate grouping of isolates with identical PFGE pulsotypes and has an excellent discriminatory power for isolates with different PFGE pulsotypes [98]. This supports the view that the analysis of DNA polymorphisms in inter - genic regions by WGS may provide truly valuable epi - demiological insights. The genetic relatedness among bacterial isolates can also be determined by examining the genome sequence as a whole. In contrast to conventional molecular typ - ing methods, WGS has the potential to compare dif - ferent genomes with a single-nucleotide resolution. This would allow an accurate characterisation of trans - mission events and outbreaks. However, translating this potential into routine practice will involve exten - sive investigations. Methods based on SNPs permit a detailed, targeted analysis of variations within related organisms. Very recently, K\u00f6ser and colleagues [91] 15 www.eurosurveillance.orgreported a clinically meaningful application of SNPs analysis involving the rapid high-throughput sequenc - ing of MRSA isolates recovered from a putative out - break in a neonatal intensive care unit. The whole genome SNPs analysis identified the isolates associ - ated with an outbreak, and clearly separated them from other non-outbreak isolates. However, one outbreak isolate showed a higher number of SNPs than the other outbreak isolates, which highlights the difficulty in applying a simple cut-off for differences in the identi - fied SNPs of isolates in an outbreak setting. Therefore, additional investigations and comparisons are needed to develop a strategy for automated data interpretation of an outbreak situation in clinical practice. Interestingly, the '100K Genome Project', which is an initiative of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Agilent, the University of California at Davis, and other federal and private partners, is aimed at the sequencing of 100,000 genomes of at least 100,000 food-borne pathogens over the next five years (http://100kgenome.vetmed.ucdavis.edu). The knowl - edge that is to be derived from this enormous effort will be extremely useful for epidemiological surveil - lance, not only due to the specific genomic information that will facilitate detailed comparisons between dif - ferent bacterial isolates, but also because the data will serve as a knowledge base for the development of new pathogen detection and typing assays for outbreak investigations. In addition to traditional epidemiological applications, WGS can also be effective for defining phenotypic char - acteristics, such as the virulence or antibiotic resist - ance of a particular pathogen [99]. First attempts to create an artificial 'resistome' of antibiotic resistance genes were already successful, as demonstrated by a comparison of genome-based predictions to the results of phenotypic susceptibility testing [91]. Similarly, based on the WGS data a potential 'toxome' was estab - lished, consisting of all toxin genes [91]. Accordingly, WGS can potentially be used to support or replace the classical determination of bacterial serotypes as it allows the detection of genes critical for the expression of particular serotype-specific antigens. However, a note of caution is in place, since the genome sequence does as yet neither allow an accurate prediction of the potentially conditional expression of particular genes, nor their expression level. This is critically under - scored by proteomics studies on the cell surface and exoproteomes of different isolates of S. aureus , which revealed high degrees of variation in the expression of particular proteins, including known virulence factors [100-102]. Lastly, genome sequences will be also used to search for genetic markers, such as the presence or absence of a gene or an amino acid substitution in a protein, which can then be linked with an exclusive or higher occurrence in a disease, or associated with dis - ease severity and virulence. Conclusions In recent years, we have witnessed substantial tech - nical improvements in existing approaches for the typing of bacterial isolates, and completely new tech - nologies have emerged that will substantially impact on the way pathogenic microorganisms can be defined and distinguished in the near future. This has involved major efforts towards the automation of these typ - ing methods, the improvement of their resolution and throughput, and the design of adequate bioinformat - ics tools. The steadily increasing number of genotyp - ing databases containing DNA sequences and DNA microarray profiles now allows easier and faster inter-laboratory comparisons, retrospective analyses and long-term epidemiological surveillance of bacterial infections. Unfortunately, there is currently no single ideal typing method available, and each genotyping approach has various advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, depending on the setting (local, national or international), one or more different typing methods need to be applied. If speed is important for contain - ing a local disease outbreak, a PCR-based method with high discriminatory power, such as MLVF and/or DiversiLab, may work well for characterisation of the isolates. However, if an outbreak of bacterial disease is disseminated among various geographical locations, a more robust typing approach, such as PFGE, will be needed to allow reliable comparison of the results obtained in different laboratories. Notably, some of the newer methods, such as MLVA, SLST, MLST, SNP or DNA microarray analysis, allow the typing of isolates equally well as the gold standard PFGE, and urgently needed results can be obtained in shorter periods of time. On the other hand, these newer methods also have certain drawbacks, including the need for highly trained staff and expensive equipment, such as auto - mated DNA sequencers or scanners. Therefore, it is much easier to replace traditional methods with newer ones at the local level than in large national or inter - national surveillance networks where all laboratories (with different staff and budgets) must implement the same new typing method and train all participants in its standardised application. It is important to realise that a newly introduced method must be very well vali - dated by different independent laboratories to deter - mine its typing potential, and this process takes years rather than months. A new method must also imple - ment a specific unambiguous nomenclature, which needs to be developed and improved during the vali - dation process. Accordingly, the replacement of an old well- and widely established method with a new one must be conducted gradually to avoid the loss of pre - cious historic information generated over many years. This is underscored by the continued use of PFGE which, for example, has remained the preferred typ - ing method in the PulseNet network for surveillance and investigation of food-borne outbreaks for over 15 years (www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/). Moreover, if a surveil - lance network addresses different bacterial species, it is also very convenient if the same standardised typ - ing platform can be used for all these species. This 16 www.eurosurveillance.orgis another reason why PFGE is likely to remain a pre - ferred method in PulseNet. Notably, because different typing methods are usually based on the detection of different genomic target sequences, strain variations detected with one method may remain undetected when applying another approach. Therefore, in certain situations, the combined use of several different typ - ing methods may lead to a more precise discrimination of bacterial isolates than the use of a single method. A completely unambiguous typing of different bacterial isolates can be achieved by WGS, as this technology has the potential to resolve single base differences between two genomes. WGS thus promises to deliver high-resolution genomic epidemiology as the ultimate method for bacterial typing. However, it is presently difficult to estimate when exactly this approach will become the norm in routine laboratories. In fact, we do not anticipate that WGS can completely replace other typing systems in the near future. Compared with many conventional methods, WGS is still not a rapid and cost-effective approach. Nevertheless, recent technical improvements as well as cost reductions suggest that, in industrialised countries, WGS will gradually become a primary typing tool in routine use. Especially, bio - informatic solutions will be necessary to extract rapidly information from WGS that is important for clin - ical microbiology, infection control and public health. Therefore, a common web-based database will be nec - essary in order to have on the one side quantifiable quality control of the enormous amount of sequencing data, and to have on the other side a growing worldwide WGS-reference database. In less-resourced countries, due to limited financial resources, the well-established conventional methods like PFGE or PCR-based typing systems will probably prevail in routine laboratories in the coming decade, although these countries may then rapidly adopt WGS once it is more affordable and prac - tical to use. In this respect, it is however important to bear in mind that all sequence-based typing methods will produce - already today - the data sets that will also be readable by the next generation, because they are based on the universal genetic code. Moreover, the challenge is to correlate continuously increasing genome sequence information with phenotypic char - acteristics of bacterial isolates and to make this data publically available via the Internet, thereby warrant - ing that these achievements will be further put to clini - cal use not only in industrialised countries but also in less-resourced countries. Finally, the data produced by WGS will be invaluable for the development of new typ - ing strategies and the optimisation of traditional typ - ing methods, such as the PCR- and microarray-based approaches presented in this review.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20382 Article submitted on 29 June 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Advances in typing methodologies have been the driv - ing force in the field of molecular epidemiology of pathogens. The development of molecular methodolo - gies, and more recently of DNA sequencing methods to complement and improve phenotypic identification methods, was accompanied by the generation of large amounts of data and the need to develop ways of stor - ing and analysing them. Simultaneously, advances in computing allowed the development of special - ised algorithms for image analysis, data sharing and integration, and for mining the ever larger amounts of accumulated data. In this review, we will discuss how bioinformatics accompanied the changes in bac - terial molecular epidemiology. We will discuss the benefits for public health of specialised online typing databases and algorithms allowing for real-time data analysis and visualisation. The impact of the new and disruptive next-generation sequencing methodologies will be evaluated, and we will look ahead into these novel challenges. Introduction In the past twenty years, the advances in several fields of biology, molecular biology in particular, led to an increased capacity to generate data. This resulted in the accumulation of large datasets and the need to store, manage and analyse them. This was the start - ing point for the development of the multidisciplinary field of bioinformatics. Hesper and Hogeweg origi - nally coined the term bioinformatics in 1970 [1]. It was broadly defined as \"the study of informatics processes in biotic systems\". But it was the convergence of math - ematicians, computer scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and health professionals for the analysis of the biological data generated in the genomic revolu - tion that resulted in the diverse disciplines comprised within bioinformatics. The field can also be subdivided into two large, interrelated subareas: data manage - ment, encompassing the creation and management of databases for biological data, and data analysis, ranging from the creation of mathematical and statis - tical models to computational tools and data mining techniques. In bacterial molecular epidemiology, bioinformatics drove the creation of online databases for microbial typing data (e.g. antibiotic resistance profiles, phage typing, serotyping or other phenotypic information), the analytic methodologies for gel-based molecular typing techniques and the study and analysis of phylo - genetic inference models. In this review we aim to provide a perspective on the bioinformatics tools that have been applied in the field of bacterial molecular epidemiology. We will explore their applications in public health, documenting how they have changed and discussing possible avenues for future research and development in the field. Online databases for bacterial typing Microbial typing methods allow the characterisation of bacteria to the strain level, providing researchers with important information for surveillance of infectious diseases, outbreak investigation and control. These methods offer insights into the pathogenesis and natu - ral history of an infection, and into bacterial population genetics [2,3], areas of research that have an important impact on human health issues such as the develop - ment of vaccines or novel antimicrobial drugs [4], with significant social and economical implications. Molecular typing methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), provided the intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility needed to create databases of isolates that could be used for longitudinal stud - ies [3]. This allowed for bacterial typing to extend beyond outbreak investigation. Results were originally stored in local databases, using specialised software 21 www.eurosurveillance.orgsuch as BioImage Whole Band Analyzer (Genomic Solutions, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI, currently discontinued) and GelCompar (currently GelComparII or Bionumerics from Applied Maths, Ghent, Belgium). These pieces of software, which integrated rudimentary database man - agement and gel image analysis, were in fact the first widely adopted bioinformatics tools used in the field. The ability to share information using the Internet led to the next step: the evolution of those software appli - cations to distributed systems in which nationwide or worldwide comparisons could be performed. PulseNet, the molecular subtyping network for foodborne bacte - rial disease [5] was the first network that created local and central databases where laboratories from across the United States (US), could securely query nation - wide data and compare their local samples. PulseNet is a governmental network initiated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and laboratories in several state health departments in the US, but has evolved to PulseNet International (www.pulsenetint - ernational.org/) [6]. PulseNet was created based on standardised PFGE protocols for the identification of pathogenic food-borne bacteria, relying on specifically trained technical personnel, but nowadays also inte - grates information obtained by other typing methods. The network derives its strength from a series of bioin - formatics techniques, implemented in the Bionumerics software, that range from optimised algorithms for gel image analysis and comparison to database manage - ment and secure sharing of data. The PulseNet online information system became the first distributed data - base for microbial typing with a direct application in public health and remains an example of the success - ful application of bioinformatics in typing and molecu - lar epidemiology. What the PulseNet distributed network achieved for PFGE, was much more simply achieved for multilo - cus sequence typing (MLST) [7], due to the inherent portability of sequence data (i.e. data easily transfer - rable between different systems). MLST is based on the analysis of allelic profiles generated by compar - ing sequences to an online repository. In contrast to PulseNet, MLST websites host publicly accessible data - bases where any laboratory can submit data, while PulseNet is only accessible by their member laborato - ries due to privacy and confidentiality issues (Table 1). The ability to easily share sequence data through the Internet [8,9] is one of the main characteristics that made MLST the method of choice for clonal identifica - tion and tracking for many bacterial species. Currently available MLST databases (Table 1) are more commonly used for nomenclature purposes and may not reflect clonal abundance. The portability that is characteris - tic of MLST allows disambiguation when analysing and comparing results. Another important feature that con - tributed to its success was the possibility to infer pat - terns of phylogenetic descent through comparison of the allelic profiles. Even though MLST became the gold standard for long-term epidemiological surveillance of several species, PFGE remains important for outbreak Table 1 Online molecular typing databases Method Database URL MLSTMLST.net http://www.mlst.net Pubmlst.org Legionella Infections Sequence-based typing databasehttp://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/legionella/legionella_sbt/php/sbt_homepage.php Environmental Research Institute, University College typing dru typing database http://www.dru-typing.org spa typing Ridom Spa Server http://spaserver.ridom.de/ analysis. 22 www.eurosurveillance.orgdetection because it often has higher discriminatory power. One example of an MLST online database, with proven use in public health, is the European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) database, currently part of the European Legionnaire's Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSnet). This typing scheme and database successfully identified sources of infection, by deter - mining clonal identity between environmental and patient isolates of Legionella pneumophila [10]. Several other sequence-based typing methodolo - gies with online databases have become available. In contrast to MLST, the majority of these methods are only available for certain species, since they focus on non-housekeeping genes, and most are single locus sequence typing (SLST) schemes. Taking Staphylococcus aureus as an example, several SLST were developed in the past decade. Two methods based on variable-number of tandem repeats (VNTR) were proposed, one relying on the direct repeat unit (dru) VNTR region adjacent to IS 431 in SCC mec [11], and the other based on the analysis of repeat patterns in the spa gene, the now widely used spa typing [12]. A major factor for the widespread use of spa typing was the implementation of a user-friendly software, Ridom StaphType. This tool allows the automatic assignment of a spa type from a DNA sequence in Fasta format or directly from chromatograms, through comparison with the centralised SpaServer [13]. Another SLST is ccrB typing [14], originally developed for meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), but extended and applicable to all staphylococci containing the mecA gene, the determi - nant of meticillin resistance. Also this method benefits from online databases and tools. A multilocus methodology that has recently shown promise for several bacterial species is multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Similarly to MLST it produces a numeric profile, in this case of the number of repeats at each locus that can unambiguously identify a given strain (MLVA type). Its appeal derives from providing a highly discriminatory method that shows high con - gruence with MLST results for several bacterial species [15], but is less expensive since sequencing of the loci is not necessary. Databases for a variety of schemes and bacterial species have been made available by several institutions (Table 1). Some of these online databases offer users the possibility to create their own private or public database like MLVAbank [16], MLVAplus or MLVA-NET [17]. A particular application of MLVA scheme is the MIRU-VNTRplus Internet appli - cation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [18,19]. Recently, a new sequence-based typing methodology was proposed using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), a specific family of DNA repeats, conferring resistance to foreign DNA such as plasmids and phages. A database and tools are also available online (Table 1). With next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies comes the ability to quickly obtain complete or nearly complete genome sequences of thousands of indi - vidual strains. In spite of the great promise of these approaches, it is still unclear how whole-genome data on bacterial pathogens will be shared and used for bacterial population surveillance and possible applica - tions in public health. BIGSdb, is a database system recently proposed to han - dle NGS data of microbial genomes and perform analy - ses focused on extended MLST typing approaches, which can comprise thousands of genes, and also on other population analysis methodologies [20]. One such scheme is ribosomal MLST [21] that, by focus - ing on the same ribosomal genes, allows a universal characterisation of bacteria, encompassing all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. In highly monomorphic and slowly evolving bacterial species such as M. tuberculosis or Bacillus anthra - cis, identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparison to a defined archetypal strain, could also be a basis for analysis, imposing different requirements on an online database. Tools for data analysis The cornerstone of molecular epidemiology is the abil - ity to compare the classification results obtained by a given typing method for two or more distinct isolates and to measure their relatedness. With that informa - tion, one can then support an epidemiological inves - tigation or raise a hypothesis about phylogenetic relationship. In this section we will describe several of the techniques developed in the last decades and used in the analysis of molecular typing data. The first methodologies used in analysis of the phe - notypic and genotypic data, were classical techniques used in numerical taxonomy [22], a field pioneered by P. Sneath and R. Sokal. The most popular are hierar - chical clustering methods, which result in a unique tree representing the relationships between isolates, commonly called dendrogram or phenogram. From that tree, groups of related isolates are defined by a simi - larity level cut-off. These are mathematical methods that were implemented in generic statistical software or custom-made computer programmes. However, for the analysis of gel-based typing data, an integrated solution of image analysis and normalisation was needed prior to data analysis. This led to the develop - ment of the first tools specific for the analysis of gel-based typing methods. They allowed the quantitative analysis of large numbers of isolates and their compar - ison with databases of already characterised strains for gel-based methodologies length polymorphism (RFLP) meth - odology. Presently, the most widely used and complete software solution for the analysis of gel-based typing methods is the commercially available Bionumerics, as it incorporates several hierarchical clustering algo - rithms for the analysis of typing data, as well as algo - rithms for the analysis of DNA sequences (Table 2). With the appearance of MLST, new analysis methodolo - gies were developed that tried to incorporate a model of bacterial evolution and spread. eBURST (based upon related sequence types) [25] implements a simple model for the emergence of clonal complexes [26,27]: a given genotype increases in frequency in the popula - tion and becomes a founder clone, and this increase is accompanied by a gradual diversification of that geno - type, by mutation or recombination, forming a cluster of phylogenetically related strains. Software that per - forms eBURST analysis is available as freeware (Table 2). The eBURST algorithm was further extended by goe - BURST [28], a global optimal implementation of the eBURST algorithm that guarantees a unique solution for the BURST rules, while simultaneously allowing an assessment of the validity of each drawn link. The goeBURST algorithm is not exclusive for the analysis of MLST sequence types (ST) and can also be used in the analysis of any other sequence-based typing method that produces an allelic profile, such as MLVA or even SNP data from NGS methods. goeBURST also clarified the relationship between BURST rules and the use of minimum spanning trees (MSTs), another commonly used method in the analysis of sequence-based typ - ing methods. It showed that the definition of clonal complexes by goeBURST is identical to pruning an MST at a chosen number of differences in the profiles that are being compared. That MSTs are easy to interpret has made them one of the preferred representation methods of the relationships inferred from SNP data in a variety of studies [29-31] Although eBURST or goeBURST have been used exten - sively and successfully for determining the genetic population structure of many bacterial species, they also have limitations. As with other methods of phylo - genetic reconstruction, the BURST rules do not specifi - cally take into account recombination. Recombination is increasingly recognised as a major force in bacte - rial evolution, and when it involves segments of DNA larger than the internal gene fragments analysed by MLST, this will lead to the presence of the same alleles in strains from different genetic lineages. Horizontal gene transfer can therefore result in STs that have sim - ilar allelic profiles due to recombination, rather than recent shared ancestry. This is particularly true for some bacterial species such as Enterococcus faecium and Burkholderia pseudomallei in which recombination occurs with very high rates [32]. In other instances, recombination was even shown to occur between dif - ferent species of the same genus [33]. To highlight recombination occurring within the analysed fragments different methods can be used, many are implemented in the software RDP3 [34], while traditional phyloge - netic methods are helpful in detecting recombination between different species. An important set of tools are implemented in the software MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) [35].Table 2 Currently available software for the analysis of typing results Application Software URL Availability Gel analysisGelCompare II http://www.applied-maths.com/gelcompar-ii CommercialPhoretix and analysis Mauve http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve24 www.eurosurveillance.orgFor the analysis of spa typing data, an algorithm was proposed to create clonal complexes from the sequence of repeats, based on an evolutionary model of repeated excision and duplication as well as sin - gle nucleotide substitutions and indels (insertions or deletions) (EDSI) [36]. This approach is available in the BURP (based upon repeat pattern) algorithm [37], implemented in the Ridom StaphType software, but could also be applied to other VNTR analysis. An important aspect in the analysis of typing data is the integration of the algorithm results with epidemio - logical data. This is usually done by annotation of the resulting trees or dendrograms. Bionumerics offers that possibility in its multiple analysis algorithms. The freely available PHYLOViZ software [38] offers a more dynamic interface for the integration of this informa - tion into a goeBURST analysis, in the expansion of the goeBURST rules to any number of loci and in MSTs. In epidemiological studies, the spatial component is of great importance. The ability to monitor the geo - graphic spread of clones at different levels (cities, countries, continents or worldwide) can provide a per - spective of the dissemination of successful clones. The website www.spatialepidemiology.net provides users with a map-based interface that allows the dis - play and analysis of epidemiological data for infectious diseases. It was used by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) [39] to pro - vide a genetic snapshot of the S. aureus population causing invasive disease in Europe, plotting spa typing data, antibiotic resistance and other epidemiologically relevant data [40]. The website can also be connected to the EpiCollect system [41], allowing the real-time collection and annotation of data using any browser or smartphone. The growing availability of sequence data also led to the increased popularity of model-based statisti - cal analysis approaches. These focus on the use of Bayesian theory to infer the most probable population structure. The software applications STRUCTURE [42], Clonalframe [43] and Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) [44,45] are freely available, but have high computational requirements for large datasets. STRUCTURE and BAPS were initially proposed for clas - sical population genetic analysis and try to infer pos - sible population structures by identifying admixture events in the population history. Clonalframe was proposed for the analysis of MLST sequence data or alignments of multiple bacterial genomes and takes into account the possibility of recombination between sequences. More recently, BAPS was also adapted to detect and represent recombination between differ - ent populations and subpopulations [46] using MLST sequences as input. These methodologies can provide a much finer picture of how the phenomena shaping population structure interact and how they influence the final population [47-49], but the computational needs and complex analysis of results still limit their application in the field of bacterial epidemiology. Not all bioinformatics tools in molecular epidemiology were initially designed for clonal inference from typ - ing data. Two freely available tools were developed with the goal of providing a quantitative comparison of typing methods. Ridom Epicompare is a stand-alone software that allows the calculation of Simpson's index of diversity [50] and 95% confidence intervals [51] for a typing method, and the concordance indexes of Rand [52], adjusted Rand [53] and Wallace [54] for the assessment of congruence between typing meth - ods [55]. The website www.comparingpartitions.info extends the features of Epicompare, by implementing confidence intervals for Wallace [56] and adjusted Rand [57] indices, as well as an adjusted Wallace coefficient and respective 95% confidence intervals [58]. These discriminatory and concordance indexes are now being used for evaluating the adequacy of a method for epi - demiological typing. More recently these indexes were used to evaluate cut-off criteria for defining groups. This was done for multilocus variable-number tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF) patterns for S. aureus typ - ing, including analyses of outbreaks and strain trans - mission events [59] as well as for PFGE [60], and also for defining clones in Staphylococcus epidermidis [61]. Bioinformatics for molecular epidemiology: the way forward The advances in the last two decades in DNA sequenc - ing capacity and bioinformatics led to an increase in the number of databases and software tools for microbial typing methods. The ability to freely share sequence data over the Internet, pioneered by MLST databases, was the turning point for the definition of a common language for the identification of bacterial clones. However, the currently available databases suffer from several drawbacks. In some cases, data submission and curation protocols still rely heavily on human input with the exchange of files by email or other non-auto - mated processes that are prone to human error and lead to extended response times by curators. Another missing feature is the absence of application program - ming interfaces for automatic querying and of stand - ardised data sharing formats. These limitations make data collation a difficult and laborious manual process that requires integrating data from different databases and preparing them for analysis by available software. Consequently, a wealth of data is left largely inacces - sible and unexplored. The first step in tackling these problems is the defini - tion of a common language to exchange data between databases and between databases and software. This is the starting point for the creation of database interoperability, i.e. the ability of tools in one data - base to query another, allowing for transparent data integration. 25 www.eurosurveillance.orgCurrent concepts and technologies for data integration are focused in the Semantic Web [62] and Linked Open Data concepts [63]. These concepts envision a data-centric approach with loosely standardised formats for information exchange, based on explicit data descrip - tions [64]. To achieve these goals, an ontology of terms in the field must be explicitly described. Ontologies provide a formal, standardised representation of the data and the relationships between the data entities [65]. Recently, the prototype of an ontology for micro - bial typing was proposed and made publicly available at www.phyloviz.net/typon/ [66]. The use of the ontol - ogy and the concepts of Linked Data for the construc - tion of webservices for data exchange and validation could prove fundamental for the integration of the pre - sent techniques with the new NGS methods. This would allow NGS databases and data analysis algorithms to be validated against the large body of data available in existing databases. The potential of NGS technology to become the ulti - mate methodology for bacterial identification and typ - ing has been recognised by the scientific community, and the first steps towards its application have been taken. NGS data result from a plethora of different technolo - gies, each with its own strengths and caveats [67]. Running a single NGS analysis of an isolate will gen - erate an amount of data that is orders of magnitude greater than that generated by other typing methods. As an example, the reads of a single bacterial genome with 100-fold coverage, will occupy around 200 MB of disk space. To handle this amount of data requires a complex IT infrastructure that was not necessary before. This also generates computational challenges that must be addressed by specialised software. Cloud computing and the use of high performance computing facilities will mitigate this problem, but are not a sub - stitute for optimised algorithms. Stimulating collabora - tions between computer scientists and mathematicians with interest in biological problems, and developing specific training programmes will be key to attaining this goal. Since the technology has been in constant evolution and the algorithms are evolving with it, there is cur - rently no stable pipeline for the analysis of NGS data [68]. Due to limited availability of expertise in this area, centralised hubs for NGS application in diagno - sis and public health have been proposed [69]. As the technology matures, the situation may change, allow - ing the deployment of NGS at hospital level. Recent releases of commercial Windows-based software with a menu-driven approach are a first step towards this goal (Table 2). However, it is important to note that at the current pace of innovation in NGS, these platforms frequently incorporate already superseded versions of algorithms that are under constant development in UNIX-based counterparts, less user-friendly, but freely available.There are already several successful applications of NGS to a variety of public health problems, ranging from outbreak or short-term epidemiology investiga - tions, to the discovery of unsuspected zoonosis cases and long-term epidemiology studies. An event that received considerable media coverage was the outbreak of Escherichia coli O:104 haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in Germany that started in May 2011. Due to the pioneering crowdsourcing efforts in anno - tating an early released genome of an outbreak isolate and subsequent follow-up analyses [70,71], it was pos - sible to promptly develop a diagnostic PCR to identify outbreak isolates. Subsequent studies were able to propose that the outbreak strain, E. coli O104:H4, had emerged due to horizontal gene exchange, shedding novel light on the emergence of new pathogens [72]. A recent pilot study focusing on the nosocomial pathogens MRSA and Clostridium difficile evaluated the feasibility of using benchtop sequencers for out - break detection and surveillance at hospital level [73]. The ability to further discriminate isolates grouped together by other typing methods allowed a better understanding of the chains of transmission and sup - ported infection control measures. Similar results were achieved when tracing an MRSA outbreak in a neonatal ward [74]. Long-term epidemiological studies have also benefited from NGS technology. The evolution of extremely suc - cessful and clones with worldwide dissemination has been followed for MRSA and Streptococcus pneumo - phylogenetic rela - tionships, these studies mapped the acquisition of mobile genetic elements and the fast-paced evolution of surface antigens that had frequently confounded previous analyses. Most intriguing was the use of NGS to identify a prob - able zoonotic origin for autochthonous leprosy cases in the southern United States [77]. The study identified a unique genotype in this geographic area that also occurred in the armadillo population, strongly sug - gesting a zoonotic origin and a potential avenue for the control of this infection. Two recent international meetings discussed and defined roadmaps in bacterial genomic identification and outbreak detection through the use of NGS. The National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark issued a consensus report from an expert meeting on the perspectives of a global, real-time microbiological genomic identification system [78]. In this report it is recognised that within 5 to 10 years, DNA sequencers will likely be a common tool in clini - cal microbiology laboratories, and that the limiting fac - tor will not be the cost of whole genome sequencing, but the creation of standardised pipelines to handle 26 www.eurosurveillance.orgthe large amounts of data generated. It was also high - lighted that a clear and widely accepted concept of the term 'clone' was needed, and that the comparison with data from existing databases (for example MLST) will play a crucial part in validating whole-genome approaches and providing the link with currently accepted and validated methodologies. It was further recognised that achieving this goal required \"a global system or at least inter-operable systems to aggregate, share, mine and translate the genomic data to direct part of the genomics efforts to address global public health and clinical challenges, a high impact area in need of focused effort\" [78]. A follow-up meeting was held in Washington, under the auspices of the United States Food and Drug Administration, also with the objective of establish - ing consensus guidelines in the field, focusing on NGS technology for outbreak detection. One of the most debated topics was the future development of databases for NGS data. The need for publicly avail - able data repositories with NGS data from all bacterial domains was reinforced as a prerequisite for the devel - opment of new analysis methods. These needs were also recently recognised in an expert consultation on molecular epidemiology hosted and organised by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [79]. As more data becomes available, it is clear that molec - ular epidemiology will also benefit from closer integra - tion with basic research in evolution and population biology. Changes in databases and analysis tools will be needed to bring about this integration in order to empower stakeholders in everyday public health decisions. Tools are being developed to integrate different sources of molecular epidemiology data as well as other meta - data (place, time, etc). However, these efforts are still in their infancy, and greater emphasis will need to be placed on the integration of different information sources in the analysis algorithms. Through the com - bined analysis of this information we can obtain knowl - edge of the epidemiology of infectious diseases. In particular, the broader use of geographic information in phylo-geographical approaches will allow a better understanding of the spread of particular clones [80]. Conclusions Epidemiology has come a long way since John Snow investigated the cholera epidemic in Soho, London, in 1854. From hand-plotting cases on a map, we have come to depend on computing power and complex bio - informatics algorithms to make sense of the wealth of available molecular epidemiology data. It is clear that bioinformatics tools have raised the public health impact of the widely used typing methods. Similarly, the NGS revolution will not be extensively available to health professionals until several bioinformatics challenges have been solved and the results can be reported in a way that can be acted upon in everyday practice. Integration of data of already established microbial typing methods, genomic and epidemiological data - bases and NGS data will be the next frontier in bacte - rial epidemiology. Once NGS becomes widely adopted, the development of software that analyses information from different data sources will be key to the synthesis of available knowledge. The public health community must also define standards for analysis and report - ing, in order to produce the desired reproducibility and common language needed for typing based on NGS to be useful in clinical settings. More than ever, the need for a convergence of specialists of numerous disci - plines in the field of bioinformatics will be fundamental to solve these challenges.27 www.eurosurveillance.orgReferences 1.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20379 Article submitted on 07 December 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Whole genome sequence (WGS) data are increasingly used to characterise bacterial pathogens. These data provide detailed information on the genotypes and likely phenotypes of aetiological agents, enabling the relationships of samples from potential disease outbreaks to be established precisely. However, the generation of increasing quantities of sequence data does not, in itself, resolve the problems that many microbiological typing methods have addressed over the last 100 years or so; indeed, providing large vol - umes of unstructured data can confuse rather than resolve these issues. Here we review the nascent field of storage of WGS data for clinical application and show how curated sequence-based typing schemes on websites have generated an infrastructure that can exploit WGS for bacterial typing efficiently. We review the tools that have been implemented within the PubMLST website to extract clinically useful, strain-characterisation information that can be provided to physicians and public health professionals in a timely, concise and understandable way. These data can be used to inform medical decisions such as how to treat a patient, whether to instigate public health action, and what action might be appropriate. The information is compatible both with previous sequence-based typ - ing data and also with data obtained in the absence of WGS, providing a flexible infrastructure for WGS-based clinical microbiology. Introduction The application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology to clinical microbiology has been described as revolutionary: the opportunities are certainly immense, but so too are the challenges of implement - ing this technology effectively [1]. Above all, clinical microbiology and epidemiology are pragmatic sciences, which require accurate and understandable informa - tion to be delivered to those who need to make medical judgements in real time. Often these judgements have to be made in the absence of complete information, and it is essential that widely understood, accepted and reproducible typing methods are employed to guide these decisions [2]. Just as the advent of molecular techniques challenged phenotypic methodologies over a decade ago - replacing imperfect but at least widely accepted techniques with a plethora of non-standard - ised alternatives [3] - the high volumes of sequence data have to be carefully managed if they are to pro - vide enlightenment rather than confusion. The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) paradigm was established in 1998 [4], a time when molecular tech - niques were beginning to be widely used in the clinical laboratory, but when there was no universally agreed way forward [5]. It was intended as a standardised, reproducible and portable approach that could replace and enhance previous methods, particularly multilo - cus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) [6]. sequence-based approach to the genome-wide characterisation of bacterial isolates to be widely adopted and automated methods for performing the reactions and extracting the sequence information have subsequently been developed [7-9]. At the time MLST was introduced, it was impractical to sequence whole genomes on very large numbers of isolates and early analyses showed that in many cases this was not required. The first MLST scheme, for example, was designed to identify major clones within populations of Neisseria meningitidis , the meningococcus, and was able to do this reliably and reproducibly with just seven gene fragments, totalling only 3,284 bp or about 0.15% of the whole genome [10,11]. Similar numbers and sizes of loci have been successful for MLST schemes cover - ing a wide range of organisms, which is an indication of the high degree of structuring present in many bacterial populations. For many bacteria, including the menin - gococcus, the extent of genetic diversity present even in this small number of genes under stabilising selec - tion is extensive [12]: as of November 2012, each of the gene fragments used as meningococcal MLST loci had between 424 to 675 distinct alleles the PubMLST Neisseria website [13], with 54-94% (mean: 71%) polymorphic. Furthermore, in the representative abcZ locus, all four bases were present at a given site over the known population in 54/433 (12%) of the nucleotide positions (Figure 1). Much of this variation is at low frequency and transitory, but 30 www.eurosurveillance.orgthe variants for which this is the case for cannot be known without exhaustive, or at least extensive, sam - pling over time. The MLST approach catalogues this extreme diver - sity, which is seen in many microbial populations and which remains only partially explored, by the mainte - nance of curated libraries of allele sequences for each MLST locus. Each unique sequence (allele) is assigned a unique arbitrary number, effectively compress - ing 400-600 bp of information into a single integer. Further organisation and compression of genetic vari - ation is attained by combining the data from all MLST loci into allelic profiles or sequence types (STs), which are also assigned arbitrary numeric designations, each of which defines a unique string of several thousand nucleotides [12]. This approach has proved to be both efficient and effective: as of November 2012, there were 9,927 STs in the Neisseria MLST database, for example, each precisely characterising a particular seven-locus Neisseria genotype. Similar levels of diver - sity have been observed in other bacteria hosted at PubMLST and on other MLST repositories [14]. The fact that nearly 10,000 distinct variants of only 3,284 bp of coding sequence under stabilising selection are known to exist in one human-associated bacterium with a genome of about 2.2 Mbp indicates the scale of the cataloguing problem facing us in the era of genomic microbiology. Nevertheless, there are instances when even the very high levels of diversity routinely seen in MLST data - sets do not provide sufficient information for clinical decision-making. This is because even populations of Figure 1 Schematic of one of the within the gene www.eurosurveillance.orgdiverse organisms, such as the meningococcus, are highly structured, with most isolates belonging to clonal complexes of related bacteria, many of which share identical STs [15]. This detection of popula - tion structuring is one of the strengths of the MLST approach, as these clusters are frequently associated with phenotypes of clinical interest such as virulence or expression of vaccine antigens [16]. This cluster - ing, however, can mean that isolates with the same ST may not have the same point source, so ST alone is insufficient to unambiguously identify strains belong - ing to an outbreak. For this reason, additional highly variable antigenic loci are included in the recom - mended typing scheme for meningococci [17] and for other organisms such as Campylobacter [18] that are regularly typed by MLST. For meningococci, there are also curated sequence-based schemes for genes that encode antimicrobial resistance that provide additional clinically valuable information [19,20]. Other schemes, such as variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR), also allow high discrimination of isolates in outbreak situ - ations [21,22]. Combining these high-resolution typing approaches with seven-locus MLST and spatial and temporal epidemiology techniques permits the proac - tive identification of outbreaks of infectious disease [23]. For a small number of bacteria, the so-called sin - gle clone pathogens, there is insufficient variation in seven-locus MLST to provide epidemiological resolu - tion, usually because these pathogens have evolved recently from single clones, undergo little recombina - tion and contain too little genetic variation [24]. These include organisms of great medical importance such Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25], Yersinia pestis [26], Bacillus anthracis [27] and Salmonella enterica var Typhi [28]. For these bacteria, data from the whole genome, often in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [29], but also including other types of variation such as VNTRs, is essential for epidemiological pur - poses. These data will also have to be stored and inter - preted in an accessible way that produces data usable by clinical decision-makers and which is both forwards and backwards compatible. One of the motivations that drove the development of MLST was future-proofing. Even at a time when the costs of sequencing were seen by some as prohibitive [30], nucleotide sequence data had major advantages: they might be added to, but they would never become obsolete - as they represented the fundamental level of genetic information - and they are readily understood, stored, compared and distributed [12]. Obtaining WGS data is now becoming so inexpensive that it is becom - ing the fastest and most economical way of obtaining information at multiple loci for determining MLST or other STs [31]. When used in this way, these data are directly comparable to the extensive sequence data - bases that have been established since the first use of MLST [32,33]. Here we describe how the suite of databases hosted at PubMLST [34] has been updated to accommodate WGS data and describe the tools that are available to rapidly extract typing information from such data. We also describe how these tools can be exploited further to achieve very high resolution from such data when required. Database structure As of November 2012, the majority of the typing data - bases hosted at PubMLST [34] were using the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) platform to archive isolate and sequence diversity data [35]. This software was developed to facilitate the flexible stor - age and exploitation of the whole range of sequence data that might be available from a clinical specimen, from single Sanger sequencing reads through to whole genomes, which may be either complete or consist - ing of multiple contiguous sequences ('contigs'), as assembled from data from the current generation of sequencing instruments. The BIGSdb platform consists of two kinds of database: (i) a definition database that contains the sequences of known alleles of loci under study, as well as allelic profiles (combinations of alleles at specific loci) for schemes such as MLST; and (ii) an isolate database that contains isolate provenance and other metadata along with nucleotide sequences associated with that isolate. An isolate database can interact with any number of definition databases and vice versa, allowing networks of authoritative nomen - clature servers and partitioning of isolate datasets and projects, with curator access controlled by specific per - missions set by an administrator. Reference databases The definition databases are central to genome anal - ysis using the gene-by-gene (MLST-like) analysis approach implemented in BIGSdb. By storing all known allelic diversity for any locus of interest, the definition databases provide a centralised queryable reposi - tory that provides a common language for expressing sequence differences, making it a trivial process to identify alleles that are different among isolates, and equally importantly, those that are identical. Because sequence differences are linked directly to a particu - lar locus (which can be any definable sequence string, nucleotide or peptide) and with appropriate grouping of loci into 'schemes' (groups of related loci), the con - text of this locus is immediately apparent: identifying it, for example, as a member of a conventional MLST scheme, as responsible for antimicrobial resistance, as a participant of a biochemical pathway and so on. As of November 2012, the Neisseria PubMLST definition database had allelic sequences defined for 114,469 unique alleles. typing information Web-based and stand-alone tools have been devel - oped that facilitate identification of STs directly from short-read data [36,37]. These methods are, of course, dependent on the sequence and profile definitions made available on PubMLST.org, which also has func - tionality to extract typing information directly from 32 www.eurosurveillance.orgsubmitted assembled genomes that are routinely scanned for known alleles. As the locations of these loci are 'tagged' in the sequence data for future reference within BIGSdb, this means that the genome sequences are automatically annotated for those loci for which definition databases exist. The definition database can also be queried using genome data not uploaded to the isolate database to identify a strain directly from sequence data. The BIGSdb platform also has func - tionality that enables an administrator to define scan - ning rules and report formatting. This uses a built-in script interpreter so that analysis paths can be taken by following a decision tree defined by the rules. This has been implemented within the PubMLST Neisseria sequence definition database to automatically extract the strain typing information for the meningococcus (ST, clonal complex and antigen sequence type com - prising PorA variable regions and FetA variable region) [17,33], along with antibiotic resistance information from sequence data that is pasted in to a web form (Figure 2, panel A). The script instructs the software to first scan the MLST alleles and, if these are all identi - fied, to identify the ST and clonal complex by querying the reference data tables. It then scans the typing anti - gens and formats the results of these with the MLST results in to a standardised strain designation [17]. Following this, the sequences of the penA and rpoB genes are extracted and then compared with isolates with matching sequences within the PubMLST isolate database to determine the most likely penicillin and rifampicin sensitivity. All of this is displayed in a plain language report (Figure 2, panel B). The whole analysis is extremely rapid, taking about 40 seconds within the web interface. Comparing genomes Because genomic diversity is recorded within BIGSdb as allele numbers, WGS analysis is possible using the highly scalable techniques developed for seven-locus MLST. Once loci have been defined and alleles identi - fied, they can be used essentially as a whole-genome MLST scheme, or any chosen subset of predefined loci combined to form a scheme. This is the principle behind the Genome Comparator analysis [38], which can use either the defined loci or extract coding sequences from an annotated reference genome to perform com - parisons against genomes within the database. Using a reference genome, or set of predefined reference loci, each of the coding sequences are compared against the test genomes using BLAST. Allele sequences that are the same as the reference are designated allele 1, while each unique allele different from the reference is assigned a sequential number. Once each locus has been tested, a distance matrix is then generated based on allelic identities between each pair of isolates. This can then be visualised using standard algorithms - the PubMLST website incorporates the Neighbor-net algo - rithm [39] implemented in SplitsTree4 [40]. Because analysis relies only on using BLAST to compare each locus within a genome in turn, either against the sin - gle annotated reference sequence or against all known alleles if using defined loci, the analysis is again very rapid, allowing multiple genomes to be compared within minutes, with the time taken to analyse only increasing linearly, not geometrically, with additional genomes. The Genome Comparator approach is generic and any number of loci in any groups can be used for this type of analysis. Many loci have been defined for the menin - gococcus, including the 53 ribosomal (r) genes that are used as a basis of rMLST [41-44]. The full complement of ribosomal genes has a number of advantages for indexing variation. These genes are universally pre - sent in members of the domain, are protein encoding and therefore generally assemble well from short-read sequences and are distributed throughout the genome. They encode proteins that form part of a coherent, macromolecular structure and contain variation that is informative at a wide range of levels of discrimination. These data can be used within and among members of the same genus, for both species and strain definition [42]. Analysis of whole genome sequence data for meningococci The Neisseria PubMLST database is continually expanding: as of November 2012, there were 221 iso - late records with deposited genome sequence data linked to published studies [11,45-51]. Of these 221 genomes, 170 were meningococci, with the remainder belonging to other species within the genus [42]. The data consisted of a mixture of finished genomes, multi - ple contigs generated from de novo assembly, contigs generated by mapping to a reference sequence and sets of predicted coding sequences. These are treated identically by BIGSdb to identify and tag sequences of known loci, and where these loci are members of existing typing schemes, such as MLST or antigen typ - ing, these genomes could be compared to legacy data (Table). Neighbor-net visualisation of distance matrices gen - erated with Genome Comparator from allelic rMLST data [44] provides a highly scalable, rapid and easily understood way of placing isolates within the known diversity of a bacterial species. For example, the inter - relationships of 139 N. meningitidis isolates present in the PubMLST Neisseria database [13] can be efficiently represented by this method. Since rMLST alleles are automatically tagged within the database, this analysis is rapid and the Neighbor-net trees can be generated in a few minutes. The rMLST analysis differentiates clonal complexes; however, in addition it provides much higher resolution than conventional seven-locus MLST [38], robustly indicating both relationships among and diversity within clonal complexes (Figure 3). The locations of isolates belonging to major clonal complexes identified by conventional MLST are indi - cated (cc1, etc.). The figure illustrates relationships not apparent from seven-locus MLST, including the 33 www.eurosurveillance.orgFigure 2 Extracting antigen and antibiotic resistance data from Neisseria meningitidis whole genome sequences A whole genome sequence, which may consist of multiple contigs, can be pasted in to the Neisseria PubMLST website (panel A) with typing and antibiotic resistance data for penicillin and rifampicin rapidly extracted (panel B) (e.g. cc1) and the interrelationships of others, e.g. cc8 and cc11 clonal complexes, and the relationships of the ET-15 and ET-37 variants within cc11. Conclusions and future prospects Nucleotide sequences are a universal language that can be interpreted in a number of ways. For clinical and epidemiological purposes, sequences from clini - cal specimens have to be rapidly and effectively trans - lated into a meaningful term or set of terms that define those properties of the aetiological agents of disease that direct medical and public health action. One of the factors behind the success of seven-locus MLST was the introduction of standard sets of nomencla - ture that reflected the structure of microbial popula - tions and their phenotypic properties. For organisms with well-established and accepted MLST and other typing schemes in place, the impact of the applica - tion of WGS data will be to rapidly identify properties such as strain type. In some cases, novel nomenclature may be required, but this is a process that has to be approached with care, if confusion in the wider clinical community is to be avoided. The suite of database subsites on PubMLST, which now includes a site that catalogues the ribosomal diversity across the whole domain for the purposes of rMLST typ - ing [44,52], provides an example of how WGS data can be used to efficiently designate specimens to current strain types. It can be also used to establish additional typing schemes which can coexist with each other side by side, as there is no limit to the number of loci and schemes that can be defined. As the database stores the sequence information that is available for an iso - late, be that a single read or a whole genome, it means that it is possible to seamlessly compare isolates for which different types of information are available, achieving backwards compatibility with previous typ - ing schemes, as well as compatibility with diagnostic tests that may target only one or a few loci. The extent to which isolates can be compared depends only on the quality of the sequence data available for the locus in question, but given that clinical specimens are often imperfect, it is important for clinical and epidemiologi - cal purposes that incomplete or partial information can be used. While many studies place short-read data in a sequence read archive, this is not easily accessible or readily analysed. PubMLST curators do proactively assemble short-read data and incorporate the result - ant contigs into the database where metadata are available. Links are made to the sequence read archive within PubMLST isolate records so that original data can be retrieved and analysed when required. While the Neisseria databases described are exemplars, databases for other species can be hosted on request and the open-source BIGSdb software is freely avail - able for local installation. The first analyses of WGS data on bacterial specimens relied on SNP analysis of closely related bacteria, with mapping of sequence reads to a predefined reference genome. These have required pre-analysis of the sam - ples by an approach such as MLST to limit the extent Table Meningococcal whole genome sequencing data linked to published studies, deposited in the PubMLST Neisseria database as of November 2012 Clonal of STs SerogroupsPorA variant 31 6 C (22), W (4), B(2), NG (1), NA (2) 8 8 cc41/44 20 12 B (14), NA (5), NG (1) 10 5 cc32 17 4 B (14), C (1), NG (1), NA (1) 10 5 cc5 16 5 A (16) 3 5 cc4 14 1 A (14) 4 1 cc1 13 3 A (13) 4 5 cc8 9 5 B (5), C (3), NA (1) 6 5 cc18 5 4 B (4), C (1) 5 4 cc23 5 2 Y (5) 3 2 cc22 4 1 W (4) 1 2 cc167 4 4 Y (4) 1 2 cc269 4 3 B (2), NA (2) 4 3 cc37 2 2 B (2) 1 2 NA: not available; NG: non-groupable; ST: sequence type.

The figure illustrates relationships not apparent from seven-locus MLST, including the diversity of some clonal complexes (e.g. cc1) and the interrelationships of others, e.g. cc8 and cc11 clonal complexes, and the relationships This approach is also appropriate and can be very effective for 'single clone' pathogens [25-28]; however, it is not feasible for the general analysis for diagnosis or surveillance of bacteria such as the meningococcus that exhibit more typical levels of sequence diversity. Indeed, the use of the term SNP when discussing bacterial genome variation outside the examples described above, is unfortunate and can be misleading. The concept of the 'SNP' has been taken from human medical genomics to microbial genomics: in humans, it is in some cases appropriate to discuss SNPs, when they are associated with a particular genetic disease, but genetic varia - tion in terms of sequence polymorphism is much more complex in bacteria. As seen here, the great majority of microbial populations contain tens of thousands of polymorphisms even within organisms that are closely related - not to mention large amounts of variation due to insertions, deletions and rearrangements, which cannot even remotely be described as 'SNPs'. The term sequence variation is more appropriate as individual polymorphisms, especially in bacteria, are invariably embedded with many other variants into alleles and it is these alleles - each often with many variable sites - that are associated with particular phenotypes. Although the typing of bacterial specimens with exist - ing schemes is a valuable contribution of WGS data to clinical microbiology and epidemiology, it is not, of course, the only use for these data. There are many other possible applications for both research and detailed investigation of outbreaks [38]; however, it is important that the analysis of these data is driven by the question that is being asked. If an outbreak can be resolved with a few loci, then there is no need to pursue the data further and certainly no need to report more detail than necessary to a hard-pressed front-line clinician or epidemiologist who, in general, will only require the information necessary to resolve the medical problem at hand. In other cases, resolution of a particular outbreak may require data from the whole genome [53]. For this reason, it will be increasingly nec - essary to store WGS data from clinical specimens in an understandable form, that is, as assembled sequences, within flexible structures, such as that offered by the PubMLST platform powered by BIGSdb, where WGS information can be hierarchically queried in real time by individuals with limited bioinformatics expertise to generate the data at the resolution required to address their problem. In this context these data will provide an exciting opportunity to extend our understanding of infectious disease caused by bacteria and will enhance our ability to combat it.References 1.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20385 Article submitted on 30 June 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Genotyping of important medical or veterinary prokar - yotes has become a very important tool during the last decades. Rapid development of fragment-separation and sequencing technologies has made many new genotyping strategies possible. Among these new methods is multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Here we present an update on the use of MLVA in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden). Researchers in Europe have been active in developing and implementing a large array of different assays. MLVA has been used as a typing tool in several contexts, from aiding in resolving outbreaks of food-borne bacteria to typing organisms that may pose a bioterrorist threat, as well as in scientific studies. Introduction Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) is a DNA-based molecular typing method fre - quently applied to the study of prokaryotes. It records size polymorphisms in several variable-number of tan - dem repeats (VNTR) loci amplified by stringent PCR protocols. MLVA will mainly impact the public health field by introducing newer, faster and safer (reduced handling of live bacteria) methodologies for typing microorganisms. Reduced typing time, with high reso - lution, is beneficial for resolving large and complex outbreak situations. The methodology is also suitable for large-scale automation: suitable instruments (e.g. automated sequencers, pipetting robots and analytical software) are already commercially available. There are several variations of MLVA assays depending on avail - able instrumentation. Earlier versions tended to meas - ure VNTR sizes by agarose gel electrophoresis, while newer assays often use capillary electrophoresis for size determination once the allele size range at each locus has been well characterised. As mentioned above, MLVA assays have clear advan - tages, offering fast typing, high resolution and reduced handling times of pathogenic organisms. Their draw - backs include high assay-specificity (e.g. each organ - ism usually needs a distinct MLVA assay) and the, as yet, lack of standardisation for the majority of published assays. In Europe, only the Salmonella enterica sub serovar Typhimurium ( S. - ardisation [1,2]. MLVA is gaining in popularity: in 2000, there was only one PubMed entry (when searching for 'MLVA') while in 2011, there were 96 entries for articles that year alone. There has been extensive research on MLVA and MLVA protocol development within Europe: an overview of organisms for which there are exist - ing MLVA assays in European countries, based on web searches for protocols is presented in Table 1. The web searches were performed on 23 April 2012 and repeated on 18 June in PubMed using the names such as 'Europe', 'European' or the countries within Europe.

In this Euroroundup, we present a more in-depth update on the use of MLVA in eight European countries. European researchers with publications describing the development or use of MLVA assays were contacted: those who chose to contribute to this Euroroundup were included. The authors were given a choice of writ - ing a general overview of MLVA assays used in their respective countries and/or giving examples where MLVA has been used to improve public health, e.g. by aiding in solving outbreaks. Denmark In Denmark, culture-confirmed cases of Salmonella and Listeria infection are notifiable by clinical labora - tories to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Furthermore, all isolates are routinely sent to SSI from the local clini - cal departments and are included in the national sur - veillance data. All Listeria isolates and the two main serotypes of Salmonella - S. Typhimurium (including the monophasic variant) and Salmonella Enteritidis) - are real-time typed using MLVA in order to investigate clusters and detect outbreaks. All incoming S. Typhimurium isolates have been typed by MLVA [1] at SSI since 2003 and all MLVA fragments are converted to true allele numbers using the refer - ence collection and standardised MLVA method [2]. As of April 2012, a total of 6,118 S. Typhimurium isolates had been MLVA typed for routine surveillance and sep - arated into 1,102 different MLVA types. Several clusters have been investigated in this period [3] and the imple - mentation of MLVA has helped to define and solve both national and international outbreaks [4]. MLVA has fur - thermore been used for typing of food, feed and animal isolates, enhancing our ability to identify the source of a food-borne outbreak. Three MLVA types (2-11-13-9-212, 2-15-7-10-212 and 3-20-7-6-212) accounted for more than 28% of all iso - lates in Denmark and were seen in an outbreak that lasted over two years (2008-2009) and included more than 1,700 patients [5]. The limited number of geno - types identified was not due to a lack of discrimination using MLVA or indeed pulsed-field gel electropho - resis (PFGE) or phage typing: all three methods were applied during this outbreak, which was unfortunately never solved. Several isolates from the entire period that this outbreak took place have undergone whole genome shotgun sequencing: very few single nucleo - tide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present in these three MLVA types. These data will be presented in a later manuscript. Another group, accounting for 13% of all S. Typhimurium isolates, is comprised of five closely related MLVA types that have been predominant from 2005 and still are (the five types are the constant loci STTR9 (3), STTR10 (NA) and STTR3 (211) and different of the variable loci and STTR6 (9,10), NA indicates negative PCR amplification, as previously described [2]. MLVA typing of S. Enteritidis has been carried out for routine surveillance since 2009 [6] and all MLVA frag - ments are converted to true allele numbers using the reference collection and five standardised loci [7]. By April 2012, a total of 1,371 S. Enteritidis isolates had been MLVA typed and divided into 131 different MLVA types. The Danish routine surveillance MLVA data have been used in defining clusters and linking patients with an S. Enteritidis infection to a common source or event. A high percentage of S. Enteritidis infections in Denmark are acquired abroad and MLVA typing of S. Enteritidis could be of added value when trying to define and solve international outbreaks in the future. Two groups of MLVA types account for more than half of all S. Enteritidis isolates. One group, seen in 33% of isolates, consists of three MLVA types with four loci in common - SE1 (3), SE2 (7), SE9 (2) and SE3 (4) - and one variable locus, SE5 (10, 12 or 13). Two MLVA types make up 25% and have four loci in common - SE1 (4), SE2 (5), SE9 (3) and SE3 (3) - and one variable locus, SE5 (9 or 10). For molecular surveillance of Listeria infections, SSI uses an in-house developed MLVA method that has shown promise in cluster detection and outbreak inves - tigations. The method is still being validated in our lab - oratory by comparing MLVA data with those from PFGE. France French researchers have been very active for more than 10 years in developing MLVA for the genotyping of pathogenic bacteria and fungi of global health inter - est (concerning humans, animals and plants) or which may pose a bioterrorist threat. These developments have included the setting up of new assays and of tools accessible on the Internet to facilitate the development of such assays [8]. Of particular interest are online databases presenting MLVA typing data, including the first one, made public in 2002 [8], the development and commercialisation of typing kits and the provision of typing services. MLVA is currently in the phase of entering routine practice in a number of reference labo - ratories and a market seems to be emerging in France. MLVA is primarily used in France for six bacterial species of high medical interest. The MLVA used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [9] is now well-known worldwide as mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units- variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR), owing to the efforts of a company (Genoscreen, Lille, France) in Institut Pasteur Lille and to the importance of this pathogen. This assay has also served as a pilot for the development of large-scale MLVA typing and associated databases. More recently, MLVA has been developed for Staphylococcus aureus , Legionella 42 www.eurosurveillance.orgpneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with the production of fully automated assays and of typing kits by the Centre Europ\u00e9en d'Expertise et de Recherche sur les Agents Microbiens (CEERAM) at La Chapelle sur Erdre. In the L. pneumophila assay, 12 loci are co- amplified in a single multiplex PCR [10]. Alternatively, the assays can be set up locally, with no need to buy kits, since all the necessary information is published [10-12]. MLVA is also in routine use for Streptococcus pneumoniae, with more than 1,000 genotypes publicly accessible from the the Robert Picqu\u00e9 Military Hospital in Bordeaux [13] and An MLVA assay for Streptococcus agalactiae been developed in France and additional MLVA assays are currently being developed by the Agence nation - ale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sanitaire de l'alimentation (ANSES) for zoonotic agents and by Centre de coop\u00e9ra - tion internationale en recherche for plant pathogens. MLVA assays, which are now used worldwide, have also been developed for major bioterrorist agents, includ - ing Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis [15], as well as minor agents, such as Brucella spp. [16], together with associated online databases. Four web-based MLVA databases have been developed in France. The first [17], hosted by Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud in Orsay, and used worldwide, started in 2002. The third version was released in 2007 and a fourth, which will be able to manage a variety of sequence-based assays in addition to MLVA, is currently under development. The second database [13], developed by the Robert Picqu\u00e9 Military Hospital, was released in 2007. Importantly these two websites allow external users to create their own database, with user-defined species, set of loci, etc., independently of the host - ing institution. The resulting databases can be shared within a community or even made publicly accessible. The other two MLVA databases were developed by the Institut Pasteur in Paris [18] and Guadeloupe [19]; the latter is dedicated to M. tuberculosis . A list of websites hosting MLVA genotyping databases for a number of pathogens is genomes and polymor - phisms website [8]. A number of French national or regional reference labo - ratories are now shifting to, or at least evaluating MLVA as a first-line typing tool: this is the case, for instance, for the A. baumanii , Burkholderia , L. pneumophila and S. aureus reference laboratories. The following section focuses on the use of MLVA for enteropathogenic bacteria genotyping in France. Use of MLV A for enteric pathogens In France, laboratory-based approaches are a key com - ponent of monitoring strategies for enteric pathogens, as a voluntary laboratory-based network of clinical and veterinary laboratories send bacterial isolates to the National Reference Centre (NRC), which performs serotyping analysis and runs weekly outbreak detec - tion algorithms [20]. The basic information currently provided by French laboratories to public health sur - veillance is the serotype of isolates; however, the discriminatory capacity is limited. Only a few sero - types are highly prevalent worldwide: Typhimurium and Enteritidis for enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Differentiation between isolates of the most common serotypes requires the use of subtyping methods: in France, this is carried out by the national reference centres or national veterinary laboratories. Standardised MLVA schemes for two Salmonella sero - types, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, have been used in France since 2005 and 2006, respectively [2,7]. For S. Typhimurium and its monophasic variant, the most common Salmonella serotypes identified in France from humans and non-humans, the reference laboratories use the widely accepted MLVA nomen - clature [2]. Due to a high number of Typhimurium and 4,[5],12:i:- strains collected from humans by the French National Reference Centre annually - around 4,000 and 1,000 respectively [21] - MLVA is exclusively used for outbreak investigations to complement primarily molecular subtyping, i.e. PFGE or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) analy - sis. MLVA is particularly performed to compare strains with those notified from an outbreak in other European countries or to discriminate among clonal isolates indistinguishable by PFGE or CRISPR analysis, such as those belonging to the multidrug-resistant DT104 sero - type Typhimurium population or to the egg-related PT4 Enteritidis. A total of 1,252 Salmonella clinical isolates were tested by MLVA in France from 2005 to 2011. Of 879 S. Typhimurium strains, there were 380 profiles; of 373 monophasic variant strains, there were 40 pro - files, suggesting that the 4,[5],12:i:-clone has emerged recently. Shigella sonnei is a monomorphic organism and therefore requires a highly discriminative sequence- based method for investigations. In France, S. sonnei outbreaks have been described and some have been investigated using an eight-loci MLVA scheme with a good Simpson diversity value, as previously described [22]. For E. coli O157, MLVA is not performed routinely, as PFGE is sufficient for tracking outbreaks, but it could be used for characterisation of an epidemic clone. Germany At the National Reference Laboratory for the Analysis and Testing of Zoonoses ( Salmonella ) in Berlin, MLVA is applied for outbreak studies involving S.Typhimurium, monophasic S.Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. For S. Typhimurium, the standardised protocol [1,2] is used and for S. Enteritidis, the method published by Malorny 43 www.eurosurveillance.orget al. [23] is used. The reference laboratory performs about 10 outbreak and tracing studies per year. S.Typhimurium surveillance in Germany relies initially on phage typing. At the National Reference Center for Salmonella and other Enterics in Wernigerode, each year, about 200 to 300 human clinical S. Typhimurium isolates from a large sentinel region (five federal states in the middle and west of Germany) are phage typed and kept in a strain collection. Over the past five years, 30% to 10% (decreasing annually) of these isolates were of phage type DT104. However, in March and April 2010, 38 (49%) of all 77 S. Typhimurium isolates obtained from this region were of phage type DT104. Strikingly, 34 of these DT104 isolates revealed resist - ance to nalidixic acid, in contrast to none of the six DT104 isolates from January and February that year. Moreover, all of the 74 S. Typhimurium isolates with nine different non-DT104 phage types obtained from the sentinel region between January and April 2010 were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The most obvious expla - nation for such a substantial increase in the number of S. Typhimurium isolates with the phenotypic-character combination of phage type DT104 and nalidixic acid resistance would be a local outbreak. Here we outline hitherto unpublished data on how MLVA was used to identify the outbreak clone. Searching for a potential source of the infec - tions, regional public health authorities isolated S. Typhimurium from several food samples from within the sentinel region; among these were DT104 isolates from pork carcasses and from raw sausages, made in a butcher's shop as a regional delicacy. The DT104 isolates from the carcasses were not resistant to nali - dixic acid, but those from the sausages were. We sub - jected all clinical and food DT104 isolates obtained from January to April 2010 from the sentinel region to MLVA analysis. In addition, we included several pheno - typically similar isolates from sporadic cases obtained during the same period from geographically distant regions of Germany. The MLVA results are summarised in Table 2. Identical MLVA patterns were observed among the majority of clinical S. Typhimurium DT104 isolates resistant to nalidixic acid and the raw-sausage isolates (Table 2, rows 1 and 4). It is interesting to note that in two phenotypically indistinguishable isolates there were single locus allelic variants (Table 2, rows 2 and Table 2 analysis of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica resistanceaAllele string of VNTR loci Isolates from the sentinel region 1 29 cases Mar-Apr A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14- 9-19-311 2 1 case Mar A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14-10-19-311 3 1 case Mar A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14- 9-20-311 4 1 isolate (raw sausage) Mar A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14- 9-19-311 5 1 isolate (pork) Mar A, C, T, S, Su 3-13-14-16-111 6 1 isolate (pork) Mar A, C, T, S, Su 3-14-14-16-111 7 1 case Feb A, C, T, S, Su 3-14- 3-20-311 8 1 case Jan A, C, T, S, Su 3-13- 5-12-311 9 2 cases Jan A, C, T, S, Su 3-17-12-16-111 Phenotypically similar isolates from geographically distant regions of Germany 10 1 case Jan A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-16- 3-23-311 11 1 case Jan A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-10-20-12-311 12 1 case Feb A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14-18-23-311 13 1 case Mar A, C, T, S, Su, Nal 3-14- 9-19-311 14 1 case Mar A, C, T, S, Su 3-13- 5-12-311 15 1 case Apr A, C, T, Nal 3-12-14-16-311 Based on antibiogram results. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method [24]. Breakpoints for interpretation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were derived from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) epidemiological STTR10, respectively. In each case, one locus differed by the presence of one additional repeat unit at the respective VNTR site, com - pared with the outbreak strain MLVA pattern (Table 2, row 1). Therefore, these loci might well be hypervari - able, i.e. drifting towards diversity even within a given outbreak. Attention must be paid to such possible hypervariability, particularly when attempting to use MLVA for long-term surveillance. The phenotypically indistinguishable but spatially and/or temporally inde - pendent S. Typhimurium isolates, however, (Table 2, rows 5 to 15) were clearly distinguishable by the MLVA approach used. Ireland MLVA is used in Ireland for Salmonella subtyping: at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Salmonella in County Kildare, its use is related to food, animal feed and animal health; MLVA subtyping for pub - lic health is carried out at the National Salmonella Reference Laboratory, Galway. All Salmonella strains isolated from official and food business operator con - trol programmes are submitted to the NRL for typing and this provides an accurate picture of the diversity of Salmonella strains circulating in Ireland. Although S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are virtually absent in poultry production due to a stamp out policy, S. Typhimurium, including the monophasic variant, is frequently isolated largely due to targeted sampling in the pig sector, where the serotype is prevalent. S. Typhimurium is also frequently isolated from samples of bovine or equine origin. More extensive information can be found in the 2011 annual report from the NRL for Salmonella in food, feed and animal health [26]. The NRL for Salmonella uses the standardised MLVA assay [1,2]. This method was initially set up in 2009 using the MegaBACE 1000 but since 2011, it has been based on the ABI 3500 platform. MLVA is applied to ascertain epidemiological linkages between isolates from different sources, e.g. to investigate transmission through the food chain or to prove cross-contamina - tion in specific settings. It has also been very useful to characterise strains related to outbreaks. One such outbreak began in the autumn of 2009 and continued into 2010: the outbreak strain was clearly identified by its distinctive phage type, DT8, and by being fully susceptible to antimicrobials [27]. The MLVA pattern was observed to be either 2-9-NA-12-0212 or 2-10-NA-12-0212. Reported consumption of or exposure to duck eggs explained 70% of cases. Trace-back investiga - tions identified S. Typhimurium with indistinguish - able MLVA types from several egg-laying duck flocks. Controls have been introduced in duck egg production units and testing has continued, which has demon - strated S. Typhimurium DT8 in over 30 sites (unpub - lished data). Another example of the use of MLVA is the retrospec - tive study that was conducted to characterise por - cine S. Typhimurium isolates recovered from different points in the food chain, from farms to meat process - ing establishments [28]. It compared the effectiveness of MLVA, phage typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in discriminating isolates for epidemiological purposes. From 301 isolates, 154 MLVA patterns were obtained, compared with 19 phage types and 38 anti - microbial resistance patterns. MLVA was particularly useful for discriminating between isolates of the same or similar phage type, e.g. DT104 and DT104b, or iso - lates that were untypable or in the category of 'reacts with phage but does not conform to a recognised phage type' (RDNC) by phage typing. Cluster analysis of MLVA profiles demonstrated two major clusters (I and II), which had a clear association with particular phage types: cluster I isolates were associated with phage types DT104, U302 and DT120; cluster II with DT193 and U288. The study showed that MLVA was highly discriminatory and permitted the identification of indistinguishable profiles among isolates obtained at different points of the pork food chain. Italy Brucellosis is an important zoonosis caused by mem - bers of the genus Brucella , which is endemic in the south of Italy, and in particular in Sicily. In addition, Brucella spp. represent potential biological warfare agents. Since 1995, the availability of whole genome sequences has enhanced the development of multi - locus VNTR-based typing approaches such as MLVA. In 2006, a scheme called MLVA-15 - based on a sub - set of 15 loci that comprises eight markers with good species-identification capability and seven with higher discriminatory power - was published [29], followed by MLVA-16, a slight modification of MLVA-15 [16]. The MLVA band profiles obtained can be resolved by techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis, microfluidics technology e Sicurezza Alimentare (Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety) of the national public health institute, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, performs MLVA-15 by direct sequencing of the PCR fragments [30]. The molecular biology Studi e Ricerche di Sanit\u00e0 e Veterinaria (CSRSV), of the Italian Army developed a high-throughput system of MLVA-15 and -16 typing for Brucella spp. using 'lab-on-a-chip' technology [31,32]. Furthermore, the CSRSV and the National Reference Center for Brucellosis in Italy, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e Brucella genotyping system based on capillary gel electrophoresis. Human anthrax is currently rare in Italy, the last case was reported in 2006 [33], while for fatal cases, only 27 were reported from 1969 to 1997 [34,35]. Animal cases are mainly located in central and southern Italy, where anthrax is still enzootic, as in other Mediterranean areas. The Centro Studi e Ricerche di Sanit\u00e0 e most for subtyping Bacillus 45 www.eurosurveillance.organthracis [15], worldwideadopted, based on the analy - sis of 25 VNTR markers on an automated platform. In 2006, 73 Italian B. anthracis samples were typed by this method, showing that most of the Italian strains were located in the A1.a group, but some strains iso - lated in northern Italy belonged to B or D groups. This result was an important novelty compared with previ - ous data published in 2005 [36], in which MLVA analy - sis of 64 Italian isolates revealed that the majority of strains (63/64) belonged to the genetic cluster A1.a, while one isolate was associated with the A3.b cluster. A more recent report (2011) confirmed that in northern Italy strains belonging to the B group could be isolated [37]. This B lineage is present in Italy, the French Alps, Germany and Croatia, so it could be assumed that B genotypes persist in livestock in the French and Italian Alps. Clostridium botulinum , the etiological agent of botu - lism, caused in Italy between 2006 and 2011 about 137 botulism cases, one of the highest prevalences in Europe [38]. The reference centre for botulism in Italy is the Centro Nazionale di Riferimento per il botu - lismo (CNRB), which is part of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0. CNRB maintains a collection of more than 400 Clostridium botulinum strains, characterised by pheno - typic as well as and genotypic approaches. At CSRSV, a MLVA-15 research project has been developed for C. botulinum in collaboration with laboratories of the other countries participating in the European Biodefence Laboratory Network (EBLN). Strains were provided mainly by the CNRB and also by other EBLN institutions. This MLVA scheme improved the dis - criminatory power compared with the previous MLVA-10 scheme for C. botulinum [39]. The analysis was extended to B and F toxin serotype strains, in addition to A serotype strains: five newly characterised MLVA loci were added to the previous 10-MLVA scheme and new groups were described. To date, MLVA data have been obtained for about 300 international C. botuli - num strains, whereas profiles from 79 strains across Europe have been published [40]. The Netherlands In the Netherlands, MLVA is used to characterise sev - eral pathogenic bacterial species, in research set - tings and for surveillance purposes. The molecular typing profiles are used to study transmission routes and assess sources of infection and also to assess the impact of human intervention, such as vaccination and use of antibiotics on the composition of bacterial populations. MLVA schemes have been developed and used by several groups outside the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) for the typing of several pathogens, e.g. and MLVA schemes have been devel - oped, which are currently used for surveillance of, for example, meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. pneumoniae . the national reference laboratory for tuber - culosis, located within RIVM, uses the MIRU (24-loci MLVA) for M. tuberculosis . The MLVA schemes developed at RIVM and a typing tool for these pathogens are maintained at RIVM [43]. The typing tool allows interrogation of a MLVA-type table: by typing in an MLVA allelic profile, it will report both the MLVA type and MLVA complex. The tool can be set to report the exact and closest matching profiles. MLVA of MRSA is by far the most intensely used MLVA scheme in RIVM. By May 2012, the MRSA MLVA data - base contained MLVA profiles of nearly 29,000 isolates and 3,351 different profiles and 28 MLVA complexes were recognised among these isolates. For MRSA, vir - tually all isolates are sent to RIVM for molecular typing as part of the national MRSA surveillance. The S. pneu - moniae database is the second largest MLVA database at RIVM. Although smaller, it still contains profiles of approximately 4,000 isolates. In all MLVA schemes used in RIVM, assessment of the number of repeats in each locus is performed by siz - ing of the fluorescently labelled PCR products on an automated DNA sequencer. Each unique MLVA profile is given a MLVA type designation, e.g. MT21, and pro - files are used for clustering and assignment of MLVA complexes. The use of fluorescent labels also allows for the simultaneous MLVA and detection of particular genes. This was used in the MRSA MLVA protocol, in which primer sets were included to detect the mecA and lukF genes. Although separation of the PCR products is performed on a DNA sequencer, standardisation may pose a prob - lem for MLVA. Differences may be caused by the use of different sequencers, buffers, etc. In order to com - pensate for these effects, RIVM supplies calibration sets (shipping costs only) that contain mixtures of PCR products of all known alleles for a particular scheme. Such a calibration set will reveal the positions to which the alleles will migrate on the user's sequencer and will help to define the correct bin positions. Norway In Norway, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) is the primary facility for nationwide surveil - lance of food-borne infections. MLVA is used exten - sively as the primary routine genotyping tool for a number of enteropathogenic bacteria with the excep - tion of Campylobacter spp. (for which other methods are applied), giving the NIPH an up-to-date overview of the spread and introduction of these pathogens in Norway. NIPH genotypes and maintains databases For typing E. coli , three different protocols are in use: two designed for E. coli O157:H7 and sorbitol-fermenting O157:H- strains (unpublished), as well as a generic MLVA assay able to genotype all serotypes of E. coli using 10 loci [44]. In 46 www.eurosurveillance.org2011, 509 E. coli isolates were routinely typed using the generic E. coli MLVA assay, giving rise to 348 distinct genotypes, with no major outbreaks detected. The MLVA assays have proven to be highly valuable in strain surveillance and outbreak detection in Norway. It is the speed and resolution of MLVA in particular that has made it the primary genotyping method at NIPH. MLVA data are further coupled with data from virulence-gene assays, phylogenetic-group typing, antibiotic resistance data (if available) or other typing methods such as binary-gene typing or single-nucleo - tide polymorphism (SNP)-typing to describe the patho - gens in detail. In case of a suspected outbreak, other complementary data (e.g. epidemiological) are added as well. A recent review of MLVA typing at NIPH was recently published [45]. Other institutions in Norway have also published MLVA assays: the University of Bergen has published the first MLVA method for typ - ing the fish pathogen Francisella noatunensis [46] and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) has developed and evaluated an MLVA assay for Vibrio cholerae , which proved to be both fast (within 3-5 hours) and highly discriminatory [47]. The Norwegian University of Science and Technology has developed and applied an MLVA assay for Streptococcus five-locus MLVA assay was considered to resolve a strain collection of 126 S. agalactiae strains considerably better than multi - locus sequence typing (MLST) and with less workload [48]. Sweden The ease of standardisation and portability of data makes MLVA particularly useful for molecular epi - demiology of zoonotic disease agents, where close collaboration between human and animal health agen - cies is necessary. For example, all primary isolates of S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium 4,[5],12:i:- found in animals and animal feed are routinely typed at the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA), using the protocol recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [1, 2]. The same method is used for all clinical isolates at the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) and data are exchanged con - tinuously to facilitate source attribution and outbreak investigation. The comparability of typing data is ensured by standardised nomenclature and analysis of an external panel of calibration strains [2] at both laboratories. A similar SMI/SVA collaboration is active for verotoxin- producing E. coli (VTEC) O157:H7, using a slightly modi - fied version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol developed by Hyyti\u00e4-Trees et al. [49]. At SVA, this method has recently been shown to offer comparable performance to PFGE typing for cattle isolates [50], while being substantially faster and less laborious. An ongoing research project is comparing clinical isolate profiles generated at SMI to those from isolates from periodical nationwide slaughterhouse prevalence studies on cattle and from sheep isolates. Again, analysis of a panel of isolates with sequenced loci was necessary to achieve harmonisation between laboratories: in this case, a certain amount of in-house optimisation was also necessary to avoid false nega - tives due to multiplex PCR competition. The MLVA for Coxiella burnetii at SVA is based on the method by Arricau-Bouvery et al. [51]. In recent years, C. burnetii has been found on several farms in Sweden and by using this method, strains that are prevalent in the country during normal conditions as well as dur - ing an outbreak can identified. An advantage of this method is that culturing is not required, which is time consuming and laborious for a biosaftey level (BSL) 3 agent. This method also makes it easier for interna - tional collaboration, since there is no need to send live bacteria between countries. For instance, C. bur - netii cattle isolate DNA sent to the SVA by a European partner for an epidemiological study is currently being analysed. In Sweden, there is an increasing trend of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in veterinary settings and food-producing animals. However, compared with the rest of Europe, the problem in Sweden is still very limited, with the exception of the high occurrence of pAmpC and ESBL producing E. coli in broilers [52]. SVA is therefore planning to use the extended Lindstedt et al. MLVA protocol [44] to study the genetic relatedness of ESBL- and pAmpC-producing E. coli among Swedish broilers, including imported breeding stocks, over time and through the production chain. Collaboration between SVA, SMI and the National Food Agency to compare ESBL-/pAmpC-producing E. coli of human, animal and food origin is also in the start-up phase. Furthermore, there are also plans to apply the protocol to study possible outbreaks of ESBL-/pAmpC-producing pathogens in veterinary settings. The same method will also be used in an upcoming SVA/SMI collabora - tive project for typing of non-O157 VTEC. Conclusion Europe has been very successful in developing and using the MLVA methodology: the amount of research and development into MLVA has been considerable for a large array of organisms (Table 1). The develop - ment of the methodology within Europe is dynamic and assay updates are frequently published. The first step towards uniform standardisation at the European Union (EU) level has been taken with the online posting of the standard operating procedure for S. Typhimurium MLVA by ECDC [53]. This Euroroundup further shows that MLVA has become an important tool for scientific studies and as an aid in outbreak detection and source tracing in European countries. 47 www.eurosurveillance.orgAs MLVA assays rely on the information gathered by genome sequencing, data available for use in method development, or improving exsisting protocols, is being published frequently. As of 17 December 2012, a total of 2,411 whole bacterial genomes were listed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [54], where all sequences may be downloaded and examined for VNTR content. Thus, MLVA assay development can be performed regardless of access to in-house sequencing (although this is an advantage). The nature of MLVA makes it a practical system for rapid sharing and digital storing of results, as can be seen by the online databases that are already opera - tional in Europe. This has been achieved in a relatively short time frame: a S. Typhimurium MLVA protocol was first published in 2004 [1] and by September 2011, standardised protocols were available in Europe [53]. In comparison, PFGE was first described in the early 80s and it was not until 2004 that PulseNet Europe was established, using protocols standardised in the United States [55]. The modern methodology asso - ciated with MLVA protocols makes MLVA a good can - didate for integrated surveillance systems, where numerous types of data relating to, for example, strain genotypes, antibiotic resistance, virulence profiles, geographical information and patient/disease infor - mation may be stored, combined and shared with the same ease. What is needed is centralised concerted action at the EU level and it is a positive develop - ment that ECDC is now integrating MLVA as part of the European Surveillance System (TESSy) [56]. This is an exciting development and it is hoped that more MLVA protocols will be integrated into TESSy in the future. Incorporation of MLVA will be beneficial in outbreak sit - uations where the speed of data retrieval is paramount for source tracing and actions across international bor - ders to end the outbreak.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20381 Article submitted on 25 July 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Molecular typing is an essential tool to monitor Clostridium difficile infections and outbreaks within healthcare facilities. Molecular typing also plays a key role in defining the regional and global changes in cir - culating C. difficile types. The patterns of C. difficile types circulating within Europe (and globally) remain poorly understood, although international efforts are under way to understand the spatial and tempo - ral patterns of C. difficile types. A complete picture is essential to properly investigate type-specific risk factors for C. difficile infections (CDI) and track long- range transmission. Currently, conventional agarose gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping is the most common typing method used in Europe to type C. difficile . Although this method has proved to be useful to study epidemiology on local, national and European level, efforts are made to replace it with cap - illary electrophoresis PCR ribotyping to increase pat - tern recognition, reproducibility and interpretation. However, this method lacks sufficient discriminatory power to study outbreaks and therefore multilocus var - iable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been developed to study transmission between humans, animals and food. Sequence-based methods are increasingly being used for C. difficile fingerprinting/ typing because of their ability to discriminate between highly related strains, the ease of data interpretation and transferability of data. The first studies using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism typing of healthcare-associated C. difficile within a clinically relevant timeframe are very promising and, although limited to select facilities because of complex data interpretation and high costs, these approaches will likely become commonly used over the coming years. Introduction Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive rod-shaped anaerobic bacterium that is capable of forming spores. Since its discovery as a cause of antibiotic-asso - ciated pseudomembranous colitis nearly 30 years ago [1], C. difficile has become the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Antibiotics change the protective normal gut flora, which enables C. difficile to colonise the colon. Clinical symptoms may range from simple diarrhoea to severe colitis which can result in death [2]. Symptoms are primarily mediated by two virulence factors, toxins A (tcdA) and B (tcdB), which are released in the gut upon colonisation by C. difficile [3-5]. In the past decade, the epidemiology of C. diffi - cile has changed and a new type emerged: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotype (RT) 027/North American pulsed (NAP)-field type 01. Besides the production of toxins A and B, the binary C. difficile transferase toxin A/B (cdtA and cdtB) has probably contributed to the increased virulence of this type in addition to still unknown factors [6]. Major outbreaks due to this strain were reported since 2004, first in Canada followed by North America and Europe [7-10]. In 2008, PCR RT078/NAP07-08 was reported as an emerging strain [11]. To study the epidemiology of C. difficile , several molec - ular typing methods have been introduced. Ideally, a typing method must have sufficient discriminatory power, typeability (the ability to type isolates unam - biguously), reproducibility and transportability (the ability to perform the method reproducibly in a fully compatible fashion in different laboratories at differ - ent times) and must be relatively easy to perform [12]. In this review, we describe the most commonly used typing methods to characterise C. difficile. In addition, we present the latest developments in typing of C. dif - ficile . Finally, we discuss the use of typing in surveil - lance studies, to trace outbreaks and to study strain transmission from the environment to patients. Historical perspective of Clostridium difficile typing Molecular typing methods can be categorised into two groups, phenotypic and genotypic methods. In the 1980s only phenotypic techniques were avail - able. Serotyping using slide agglutination was com - monly used in the mid-1980s. Initially, this assay was capable to differentiate six serogroups [13], later this 50 www.eurosurveillance.orgwas improved to 15 serogroups [14]. Other commonly used methods in this period were autoradiography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (radio PAGE) [15] and immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum prepared from rabbits immunised with four different C. difficile strains [16]. Phenotypic assays had low reproducibility, low typeability and insufficient discriminatory power to apply to epidemiological studies [12]. Genotypic techniques with better typeability and discriminatory power replaced phenotypic methods during the 1990s [12]. Genotypic methods are divided into band-based and sequence-based methods. The most commonly used band-based methods were restriction endonu - clease analysis variable-number analysis (MLVA), whereas the most frequently used sequence-based genotyping method was multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a promising sequence-based technique as it allows the detection of variations between C. difficile strains by, for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis. Here we present a brief summary of the current performance and costs of genotyping methods (Table 1 and 2), as a detailed description is beyond our scope and can be found in three other reviews on molecular typing [12,17,18]. Currently used typing methods for Clostridium difficile In Europe PCR ribotyping is presently the most fre - quently used typing method of C. difficile. This method was first applied by Gurtler et al. [21] and exploits the variability of the intergenic spacer region (ISR) between the 16S and 23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which is type-dependent. The variability, in combination with multiple copies of rDNA present in the genome, results in various amplicons after PCR amplification. These amplicons are separated by common agarose gel elec - trophoresis. The obtained banding patterns are referred to as PCR RTs. Two different sets of primers have been developed for typing of C. difficile [22,23]. The O'Neill primers described by Stubbs et al. [23] seem to have better discriminatory power than the Bidet primers [24]. The discriminatory power ( D) of a typing method is its ability to distinguish between unrelated strains, this D-value is based on Simpson's index of diversity [25]. PCR ribotyping is currently capable of identifying more than 400 distinct PCR RTs. In North-America, PFGE is commonly used. PFGE of C. difficile involves digestion of genomic DNA with an infrequent cutting restriction enzyme, for example Sma I [26]. PFGE allows separation of large DNA frag - ments which is not possible with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. The obtained DNA fragments are separated using agarose gel electrophoresis with an electric field orientation repeatedly switching in three different directions (pulsed-field); one direction is through the central axis of the gel, whereas the other two are at an angle of 60 degrees on either side. The pulse time of the direction is linearly increased dur - ing the run so that progressively larger fragments are able to migrate forward through the gel, resulting into separation based on fragment size. The obtained banding patterns are referred to as NAP-field types. Unfortunately, standardisation of protocols and valida - tion of PFGE for C. difficile have never progressed as they did for other food-borne pathogens on PulseNet at the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [27].Table 1 Performance characteristics of various genotyping methods Fair Fair Poor Moderate Poor PFGE Whole genome Moderate Fair Moderate Fair Moderate Moderate PCR ribotyping 16S-23S ISR Good PCR ribotyping 16S-23S ISR Excellent Moderate Good Good Moderate Good MLVAWhole genome, tandem repeatsExcellent Poor Moderate Good Moderate Moderate Sequence-based MLST 7HG 7 HG Good Moderate Moderate Excellent Moderate Excellent SNP typingWhole genome, SNPsExcellent Moderate Kuijper al. [17]. 51 www.eurosurveillance.orgIt has been reported that PFGE displays better dis - criminatory power than PCR ribotyping with D-values of 0.843 and 0.688, respectively [18]. In contrast, pre - liminary results of a study comparing different typing techniques on 39 of the most frequently found PCR RTs in Europe demonstrate that only 16 NAP-field types were obtained of 39 PCR RTs (personal communica - tions, M Mulvey and D McCannel, 2011). A common concern with all band-based typing methods is the difficult interpretation of DNA banding patterns, espe - cially when a DNA banding pattern differs marginally from the reference patterns. Consequently, appropriate definitions are required to identify new types with both PFGE and PCR ribotyping. In Europe, the Cardiff collec - tion of Jon Brazier and Val Hall serves as a reference collection and new PCR RTs are always validated using this database. Currently, a clinical collection of 20 dif - ferent C. difficile PCR RTs (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)-Brazier collection) iso - lated from various European countries is available to distribute among all reference laboratories in Europe who participate in the European C. difficile infection study network (ECDISnet) [28]. The usage of two dif - ferent standard typing methods in Europe and America has resulted into different nomenclatures, making interlaboratory exchange of data difficult. Already in 1994 Brazier et al. [29] emphasised the need for a uni - fied nomenclature. In 2004, MLST was introduced to study the popula - tion structure and global epidemiology of C. difficile [30]. This sequence-based typing method relies on sequencing of DNA fragments approximately ranging between 300 and 500 bp representing seven house - keeping genes (MLST 7HG). Sequence variants for each housekeeping gene are assigned with a distinct allele number and the combination of seven allele numbers (allelic profile) provides a sequence type (ST). MLST generates high-throughput sequence data that can be uploaded from laboratories worldwide to a common web database [31]. This facilitates ST calling as well as studying the population structure and global epi - demiology of C. difficile. Two different typing schemes have been proposed in literature to characterise C. dif - ficile isolates [30,32]. Both typing schemes consist of seven housekeeping genes of which three are shared (triosephosphate ). In contrast to the scheme published by Griffiths et al. [32], the MLST scheme described by Lemee et al. [30] was not widely adopted. This can be partially explained by the pres - ence of a null allele on the D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (ddl) locus of the Lemee scheme which failed to amplify in certain strains [32]. Recently, this locus in the Lemee scheme was replaced by the groEL gene [33]. It has been reported that the discriminatory power of MLST and PCR ribotyping is comparable [18,32]. For studying outbreaks at a local level, a typing method should have higher discriminatory power than PCR ribotyping and MLST. For instance an increase in inci - dence of a PCR RT or MLST ST in a hospital can provide us with a clue for an outbreak and is useful data for monitoring changes in type prevalence rates, but does not necessarily proves clonal spread of one strain.Table 2 Techniques, time and costs associated with various genotyping methods for Clostridium difficile Genotyping method Techniques Turnaround time (post-culture)Hands-on time (post-culture)Costs EquipmentaPer testb REA DI, ER, GE 2 days 2 hours Low Low PFGE DI, ER, GE 2-4 days 6 hours Moderate Low PCR ribotyping DI, PCR, GE 1-1.5 days Low Capillary ribotyping DI, PCR, CE 1 hours Moderate/ high Low MLVA DI, PCR, CE 2 days 8 hours Moderate/ high Low/ moderate MLST DI, PCR, PPP, SE 4 days 8 hours Moderate/ high Moderate SNP typing DI, LP, TA, SE Cost index for the equipment set-up: low < EUR 10,000 < moderate < EUR 100,000 < high. b Cost index per test for materials: low < EUR 10 < moderate < EUR 100 < high. c This estimated turnaround time is based on using Illumina Miseq benchtop sequencing [19]. d The hands-on time was determined by turnaround time substracted with the runtime of the Illumina Miseq benchtop sequencer [20].52 www.eurosurveillance.orgMLST is an appropriate tool for studying the phylog - eny of C. difficile. Compared to a band-based typing method, such as PCR ribotyping, MLST is less vul - nerable to recombination events. Recombination in a housekeeping gene would change the allelic profile on a single locus only. Even though the consequence would be a change of ST, this new ST would still be closely related to the original ST maintaining the phy - logenetic link. Recombination of repeats present in the ISR between the 16S and 23S rDNA [34] might lead to the formation of a novel PCR RT without a clear phylo - genetic link. However, the rate at which these recom - bination events occur and the predisposing factors are unknown. Phylogeny reconstruction with MLST revealed that C. difficile diversified into at least five well separated lineages during evolution [32,35,36] and possibly a sixth monophyletic lineage [37]. The majority of STs were assigned to lineage 1 with no major subdivisions (Figure 1), but this result could be due to an unfortunate choice of housekeeping genes. Changing the housekeeping genes or adding house - keeping genes to the current MLST scheme might pro - vide a better resolution of lineage 1. A major advantage of sequence-based typing methods like MLST is the ease of interpretation of the generated data. Sequence data are unambiguous and therefore objective, highly reproducible and easily exchangeable between laboratories. Moreover, many laboratories have submitted their sequences to a freely accessible C. difficile MLST database [31]. Currently (last updated: 21 Nov 2012), 176 different STs have been identified. A practical disadvantage of MLST remains the relatively high cost of sequencing multiple targets, which could partially explain why MLST has not replaced conven - tional PCR ribotyping in many European laboratories. MLVA is a highly discriminatory molecular typing method that has been introduced to study outbreaks and identify routes of transmission between patients and hospitals [11,38-42]. MLVA relies on the amplifi - cation of short tandem repeats that vary in size and are dispersed throughout the genome. The obtained amplicons are separated with capillary electrophoresis followed by automated fragment analysis. Initially, two different typing schemes were published which both contain seven loci of which four are identical [41,42]. Each of the seven loci is designated with a number that corresponds to the sum of repeats present on that locus. A minimum spanning tree (MST) can be con - structed, in which the summed tandem repeat differ - ence (STRD) is used as a measure of genetic difference (Figure 2). Clonal clusters are defined by an STRD of 2, and genetically related clusters are defined by an STRD of 10 [11,41]. Broukhanski et al. [43] indicating that and H9 did not contribute to the discrimina - tory power. In addition, Bakker et al. [44] reported that MLVA locus A6 is a null allele in PCR RT078 and that for several other loci the PCR settings had to be for individual PCR RTs. Currently, MLVA has been implemented as useful typing method to investigate C. difficile 027 outbreaks in the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom (UK) [38,45,46]. In England, C. difficile infection (CDI) cases that are potentially linked, i.e. caused by isolates that share the same PCR RT and which are related in time and place, are investigated using MLVA. Notably, almost half of such presumed clusters are shown actu - ally either to consist of unrelated isolates or a mixture of related and distinct strains [46]. Recent developments in typing of Clostridium difficile Variant multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis typing schemes Recently, a modified MLVA (mMLVA) was developed, combining MLVA with PCR detection of several toxin genes (tcdA and tcdB, cdtB; and deletions in the toxin C gene (tcdC)) [37]. In addition, the number of MLVA loci was to five excluding the invariable loci F3 and H9. Although the combination with toxin gene detection can be informative, it is not yet possible to correlate these data with specific C. difficile types, like PCR RT027/NAP01. This is partially because the presence of binary toxin genes combined with the 18 bp tcdC deletion is not restricted to PCR RT027 strains [37,47]. In a study by Manzoor et al. [48] the number of MLVA loci was increased to 15. This extended MLVA (eMLVA) scheme was able to discriminate clinically signifi - cant clusters while maintaining a good concordance with PCR ribotyping. Typing schemes containing only seven loci showed in contrast poor association with PCR ribotyping [41,42]. These seven loci schemes can only be used as a subtyping method together with PCR ribotyping, whereas the extended MLVA can potentially replace both. It should be noted, however, that increas - ing the number of loci makes the method more labori - ous and increases the difficulty of data interpretation. Wei et al. [49] screened 40 MLVA loci for developing an MLVA typing scheme that has a good concordance with PCR ribotyping and provides satisfactory data for studying outbreaks. From this study, it was concluded that typing schemes consisting of MLVA loci with low allelic diversity maintained a high correlation with PCR ribotyping, whereas typing schemes using MLVA loci with high allelic diversity were required to study outbreaks. To fulfil both purposes two different typing schemes were proposed comprising 10 loci with limited allelic diversity and four loci with highly variable allelic diversity. Capillary polymerase chain reaction ribotyping Although PCR ribotyping has become widely used in many European laboratories for C. difficile sur - veillance, issues with pattern interpretation and limited access to a well standardised database are 56 www.eurosurveillance.orgcommon C. difficile variants causing disease in human and animal populations [59] serve as references to map next generation sequence data in order to detect variation within the core genome (genes shared by all organisms) or the accessory genome (genes present in only some organisms) [60]. The first description of C. difficile PCR RT027 phylog eny using high-throughput WGS demonstrated that 25 PCR RT027 isolates from the US and Europe could be further discriminated into 25 distinct genotypes based on SNP analysis [54]. Furthermore, this study dem - onstrated that isolates from different regions of the US and Europe occupy distinct evolutionary lineages and harbour unique antibiotic resistance genes. More recently, it was demonstrated that PCR RT027 isolates emerged through two distinct epidemic lineages after acquiring the same antibiotic resistance mutation; moreover these two lineages displayed different pat - terns of global spread [61]. The routine use of WGS in diagnostics and epidemiology is nicely reflected by the study of Koser et al. [62]. In this study it was reported that whole-genome SNP typing can be mainly used for monitoring outbreaks and recognition of pathogen transmission pathways. Current methods for monitor - ing C. difficile hospital associated outbreaks, such as PCR ribotyping, have too limited discriminatory power to characterise potential outbreak strains as the same bacterial clone. Sequencing of whole genomes offers the optimal discriminatory power allowing laboratories to detect transmission pathways between hospitals, hospital wards and patients on the same ward. In addition, Eyre et al. [19] demonstrated that WGS can produce practical, clinically relevant data in a time frame that can influence patient management and infec - tion control practice during an outbreak. Moreover, this study demonstrated that a cluster of healthcare-asso - ciated C. difficile cases caused by the same ST was in fact a number of unrelated sub-lineages, therefore allowing to rule out in patient-to-patient transmission. Furthermore, WGS combined with comparative genom - ics is an effective approach to identify novel genetic markers that are potentially linked to virulence. This is an important advantage above conventional typing methods that use existing markers for characterisa - tion of isolates. Whole genome sequencing is not likely to replace routine diagnostic techniques in reference laboratories. For example, matrix-assisted laser des - orption/ionisation (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF), which is rapid and easy to perform, is currently used in the Dutch reference laboratory for primary detection of pathogens. In order to determine whether sequenced isolates are part of an outbreak, it must be defined how many SNP differences still represent 'related' isolates. For that reason, we should be informed on the rate of SNP accumulation in C. difficile lifecycle (molecular clock), although bacterial isolates with a hypermutator phe - notype could complicate the determination of such a threshold [56]. The molecular clock rate of C. difficile was reported at 2.3 SNPs/genome/year in the study done by Eyre et al. [19]. Further study is necessary to confirm this rate of C. difficile evolution. Application of typing methods to study the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections An obvious reason to type C. difficile isolates is to early detect and investigate outbreaks, which can be defined as 'a temporal increase in the incidence of a bacterial species caused by transmission of a certain strain' [63]. In addition, typing methods contribute to epidemiological surveillance on national, European or worldwide level and can be used to report the inci - dence of various C. difficile types and recognise newly emerging virulent types [63]. Typing might also estab - lish the local and global spread of bacteria and eluci - date routes of transmission. In the beginning of the 21st century, a worldwide increase in the incidence of CDI was seen. Soon there - after, it was recognised that a specific type of C. diffi - cile, PCR RT027, was linked to this increase of incidence [7,9]. PCR RT027 was associated with specific predis - posing factors, course and outcome of CDI. In a large Canadian outbreak, fluoroquinolones were associated with PCR RT027 and mortality rates among patients with this type increased to 23% within 30 days of diag - nosis [9,64]. In the Netherlands, molecular typing of C. difficile using PCR ribotyping contributed to recog - nition of an outbreak of two simultaneously occurring PCR RTs (027 and 017) [45]. Again, patients had PCR RT-specific risk factors and mortality rates. Numerous studies demonstrated the increased virulence of PCR RT027 [6-10] and found that other emerging types, such as PCR RT078, were also associated with specific risk factors or complicated clinical course [11]. Without results from typing methods, these associations would have stayed unrecognised. Molecular typing results can also be used to com - pare the distribution of various C. difficile types iso - lated from animals, humans and food, which can hint towards food-borne disease or zoonotic potential of specific PCR RTs. The emerging C. difficile PCR RT078 in humans is found in high numbers in animals, especially piglets and calves [11,65-67]. Koene et al. [68] investi - gated the presence and characteristics of C. difficile in seven different animal species. PCR RTs 012, 014 and 078 were most frequently isolated among these Dutch animals, similar types were found among hospitalised patients in the Netherlands in 2009/2010. Meat con - sumption has also been suspected to contribute to transmission of C. difficile. PCR RTs 001, 017, 012 and 087 have been isolated from meat in Europe, however, isolation rates are low and might not be high enough to exceed the infectious dose [65-69] . Although PCR RTs in animals, meat and humans overlap, PCR ribotyp - ing lacks discriminatory power to show clonal spread of C. difficile isolates from humans to animals. New 57 www.eurosurveillance.orgmolecular methods should be developed and applied. The optimised MLVA scheme developed by Bakker et al. [44] showed relatedness between human and por - cine PCR RT078 strains, although this could not always be confirmed with epidemiological data. Hopefully, highly discriminative typing methods such as whole-genome SNP typing can provide us with novel insights on zoonotic transmission. Importance of molecular typing for national surveillance by reference laboratories In Europe and North America, surveillance studies to monitor the incidence of CDI and the spread of hyper - virulent strains have been established at regional and national levels since 2007 although reporting of CDI is not mandatory in all European Union (EU) countries. To enhance surveillance for CDI, the ECDC and the US CDC advised to widely launch surveillance programmes for CDI [28]. Consequently, a European network to support capacity building for standardised surveillance of CDI was initiated by the ECDC [28]. When methods and data on existing national CDI sur - veillance systems in Europe were reviewed (personal communication, A Kola, 2012), surveillance of CDI was reported in 45% (14/31) of the European countries. Active surveillance of CDI is performed in Austria, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg and the UK [46,70-79]. Surveillance was mostly con - tinuous and prospective, but only four surveillance systems combined microbiological and epidemiologi - cal data (typing and susceptibility testing results) on a regular basis. A second recently completed survey in Europe (personal communication, D W Notermans, 2012) demonstrated that the majority of the laborato - ries were able to culture, but only half had access to typing. This limited typing capacity demonstrates the uncertainty of the true incidence levels of C. difficile types across Europe and hampers recognition of new emerging C. difficile types. The contribution of national reference laboratories to survey CDI on a national level is illustrated by examples from the Netherlands and the UK. In 2005, soon after the emergence of C. difficile PCR RT027, the Center for Infectious Disease Control (CIb) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands started a national Reference Laboratory for C. difficile. In 2009, this laboratory noticed an emer - gence of a new virulent PCR RT078, which was the third most frequently found type in the Netherlands among humans and was present in nearly all pig farms inves - tigated [11,67]. Subsequently, this type was also found emerging in other European countries [80]. Recently, the reference laboratory noticed a re-emergence of C. difficile PCR RT027 since 2010. In the period between May 2011 and May 2012, 289 samples from 26 health - care facilities and laboratories in the Netherlands were submitted because of severe CDI cases or outbreaks. PCR RTs 001 and 027 were the most commonly found (both 15.0%). Interestingly, in contrast to a previ - ous report of declining PCR RT027 in hospitals in the Netherlands [81], type 027 was frequently identified in long-term care facilities associated with exchange of patients to neighbouring hospitals. In the UK, the C. difficile Ribotyping Network (CDRN) was established in 2007, as part of improved CDI surveillance, to facilitate the detection and control of epidemic strains. Between 2007 and 2010, the CDRN received a large number of isolates (n=11,294) for PCR ribotyping. Typing results indicated that almost all of the 10 most common PCR RTs changed significantly during this time period [79]. As the proportion of CDI caused by PCR RT027 declined (from 55% to 21%), sig - nificant increases were observed in the prevalence of other C. difficile types, especially PCR RTs 014/020, 015, 002, 078, 005, 023, and 016. In addition, there was a 61% reduction in reports of C. difficile in England from 2008 to 2011, which occurred coincidently as the proportion of CDI caused by C. difficile PCR RT027 declined. Notably, the large reduction in incidence of C. difficile PCR RT027 cases has been paralleled by decreases in CDI related mortality [82]. The perceived success of the surveillance programme means that cur - rently approximately a third of all CDI cases in England are referred to CDRN. CDI control programs should ide - ally include prospective access to C. difficile typing and analysis of risk factors for CDI and outcomes. Future perspective In the last fifteen years molecular genotyping meth - ods have replaced some of the more traditional typ - ing methods. WGS will dominate the field of molecular typing in the next decade. However, before WGS can be used as a routine tool for molecular typing some requirements need to be fulfilled. First, WGS needs to be fast, preferentially within 48 hours. Furthermore, the technical workflow including data analysis needs to be simplified into an automatic pipeline. Finally, the costs for acquiring the technical and organisational platform needed to perform WGS must be reduced. Fulfilling, these requirements, which is in our opinion a matter of time, would greatly increase the use of WGS worldwide.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20369 Article submitted on 29 June 2012 / published on 17 January 2013 The association between a particular mutation in the HA1 subunit of the influenza virus haemagglutinin, D222G, and severe and fatal disease in cases of influ - enza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Norway during the 2009 pan - demic was investigated using pyrosequencing. The prevalence of the variant among fatal cases was 8/26 and among severe non-fatal cases 5/52. No D222G mutations were found among the 381 mild cases. This difference could not be attributed to sampling differ - ences, such as body location of sampling, or duration of illness. In cases with mutant virus where clinical specimens from different days of illness were avail - able, transition from wild-type to mutant virus was commonly observed (4/5), indicating that the mutant virus emerged sporadically in individual patients. In patients with paired samples from both the upper and lower respiratory tract (n=8), the same viral geno - types were detected in both locations. In most of the D222G cases (11/13), the mutant virus was found as a quasispecies. Introduction Infection with the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus that emerged in 2009 led to mild disease in the vast major - ity of cases; however, there was also an unusual occur - rence of viral pneumonia, severe disease and death in younger age groups than commonly observed for seasonal influenza [1]. In a large proportion of severe cases, conditions predisposing for severe disease have been identified [2] and host factors therefore appear to strongly influence the clinical outcome of infection. On the other hand, this novel virus of zoonotic origin dif - fered from the previous seasonal A(H1N1) virus in the resulting disease profile; thus, viral determinants of pathogenicity must also be involved - e.g. it has been shown to be more pneumotropic than seasonal A(H1N1) virus in a ferret model [3]. It is important to understand better what viral and host-related factors determine the observed dichotomous pathogenicity profile. The first cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infec - tion in Norway were recorded in early May 2009, shortly after emergence in Mexico, but cases were few and scattered across the country until mid-summer. A limited influenza epidemic took place in late July/early August, followed by a comparatively calm period lead - ing up to a major epidemic that surpassed all previous peaks recorded in the current surveillance system. The epidemic reached its highest point in early November and by the end of 2009, it had mostly subsided. As part of the intensified surveillance carried out dur - ing the 2009 influenza pandemic, the national refer - ence laboratory for human influenza at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health received a large number of respiratory specimens from confirmed and possible cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In late November 2009, we noticed that a particular amino acid sub - stitution - aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) in the haemagglutinin glycoprotein subunit HA1 at posi - tion 222 (D222G) - appeared in fatal cases, while we did not find it in the numerous mild cases analysed. Realising that a similar pattern seemed to be taking place in the Ukraine (R. Daniels, personal communica - tion, November 2009) and given that the mutation had been shown to influence viral receptor specificity in another influenza A(H1N1) virus [4], it was decided to notify international public health authorities and other national authorities about this possible pathogenicity determinant, to expedite assessment of it [5]. A prelim - inary review in January 2010 of D222G amino acid sub - stitution in the HA of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that mutations, including those leading to the D222G sub - stitution in the HA, had appeared sporadically since the first emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and that the substitutions in HA had been reported in viruses obtained from cases of mild to severe to fatal illnesses but that such viruses had neither formed dis - tinct phylogenetic clustering nor been associated with consistent changes in virus antigenicity [6]. Since the first account of our findings in Norway [7], investigations into the occurrence of this mutation resulted in an increasing number of reports [8-28]. While the prevalence of this mutation varied between 61 www.eurosurveillance.orgthe reporting countries, in most studies, the 222G mutation is primarily found in severe and fatal cases. One of the first larger studies came from a group in Hong Kong, who analysed this amino acid position in severe and non-severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [13]. Nine (4.1%) of 219 severe or fatal cases of pandemic influenza had the mutation, in contrast to none of 239 non-severe cases. Data from these reports indicated that the D222G mutation was absent or uncommon in viruses that were in sustained circulation. However, one case of trans - mission of a 222G virus was reported [9], but the trans - mitted virus in this case had acquired an additional mutation that may have influenced receptor binding characteristics. To further investigate the sporadic occurrence of the 222G mutant influenza virus, we performed a more in-depth analysis of an expanded data set. Our original data set [7] included 266 cases, while the expanded set comprised 462 cases. The present study included assessment of the majority of the fatal cases in Norway, as well as of a larger number of samples from severe non-fatal and mild cases collected throughout the pandemic. We studied the prevalence of HA1 222 mutations within different clinical outcome groups, in serially collected specimens, in upper versus lower respiratory tract and in early versus late specimens. We also analysed age and sex distribution and examined the characteristics of the fatal cases. We further compared the mutant viruses phylogeneti - cally, looked for the presence of mutant quasispecies and oseltamivir resistance. Methods Data and clinical materials As part of the intensified surveillance instigated in response to the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in April 2009, virus-containing specimens from all parts of the country were received in the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, which serves as the National Influenza Centre in Norway. A total of 15 medical micro - biology laboratories submitted specimens containing influenza virus (original specimens, nucleic acid prepa - rations from original specimens or virus isolates) to the National Influenza Centre for further characterisation. Most of these patient specimens originated from pri - mary care clinics; the remainder were from hospitals. Each laboratory sent a maximum of five specimens each week plus any specimens from patients with severe disease, suspicion of antiviral resistance or other special circumstances such as suspected vac - cine failure. In addition, intensive care and fatal cases remained notifiable to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health throughout the pandemic and we actively solicited materials from microbiology and pathol - ogy laboratories that were in possession of speci - mens from these cases. Together, these collection schemes enabled us to obtain specimens from nearly all the recorded fatal influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in Norway as well as a large number of severe and mild cases. Patient information relevant for this study was obtained primarily from the patient referral forms that came with the specimens, supplemented with informa - tion gathered in the notification of severe and fatal cases and, in a few cases, from direct contact with cli - nicians who cared for the patient. Cases were assigned to clinical outcome groups by a medical specialist, according to WHO guidance criteria [2]. Briefly, the cri - teria for complicated/severe influenza included: clini - cal and/or radiological signs of lower respiratory tract disease, central nervous system involvement, severe dehydration, secondary complications (renal failure, multiorgan failure, septic shock, rhabdomyolysis, myo - carditis), exacerbation of underlying chronic disease or signs and symptoms of progressive influenza disease. The criteria were modified as follows: hospital admis - sion in itself did not lead to classification as severe influenza, without additional evidence of complicated disease. This modification was necessary due to a low threshold for hospitalisation of patients during parts of the pandemic. Furthermore, sustained virus replica - tion in itself was not regarded as evidence of severe influenza. From the available specimens, we picked all the specimens from fatal and ICU cases as well as a large subset of specimens from the other cases, mak - ing sure that viruses from all parts of Norway and from the entire first period of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circula - tion in the country (May 2009-January 2010) were well represented. The selected specimens were sequenced with regard to the codon encoding amino acid 222 of the HA1 subunit. Only cases where the HA1 222 gen - otype could be ascertained in the original specimen were included in the study. Detection of HA1 222 mutations at nucleic acid level Initially, mutations were detected through conven - tional (Sanger) cycle sequencing of reverse transcrip - tion-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplicons obtained from viral RNA from virus isolates and pri - mary specimens. Viral RNA was extracted using a total nucleic acid extraction kit in the MagNA Pure LC System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). In general, a modification of the full genome sequencing proto - col provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [28] was used for virus isolates, whereas sequencing of the amplicon from a more sen - sitive RT-PCR [30] was used for many of the primary specimens. As soon as we became aware of the possible impor - tance of the mutation, a pyrosequencing assay was designed and used. Briefly, a 110-nucleotide amplicon 62 www.eurosurveillance.orgFigure 1 Phylogenetic reconstruction of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 gene (HA1), Norway 2009/10, showing the distribution of 222G viruses across the phylogeny Viruses harbouring 222G are marked with solid circles. The entire coding region of the HA1 subunit was analysed. The codon for amino acid 222 was excluded for this analysis, in order to investigate how 222G mutants were otherwise related.0.001 63 www.eurosurveillance.orgTable 1 Risk factors for severe illness in fatal cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with available haemagglutinin gene (HA1) 222 genotype, Norway, 2009/10 (n=26) Risk factors for severe disease Number of cases Presence of risk factors None 4 One or more 21 Data unavailable 1 Individual risk factorsa Chronic respiratory disease 4 Chronic heart disease 7 Chronic renal or hepatic disease 0 Diabetes 2 Pregnancy 1 Obesityb 3 Immunosuppression 3 Chronic neurological disease or injury 3 Other 7 a Each patient may have several risk factors. b Obesity: for one of these patients, a body mass index (BMI) of >40 was reported. The other two were reported as 'obese' or 'adipose', with no BMI given. encompassing the region of the HA gene which encodes amino acid 222 was generated from 5 \u00b5l specimen RNA combined with each of System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen) in a 25 \u00b5l reaction and subjected to the following cycling condi - tions: 30 min. at 50 \u00b0C, 2 min. at 94 \u00b0C; 45 cycles of 15 sec. denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 30 sec. annealing at 55 \u00b0C and 1 min. extension at 68 \u00b0C; finally, 5 min. at 68 \u00b0C for final extension. The pyrosequencing reactions were performed as previ - ously described [29] using a residue-specific sequenc - ing primer (5'-AGCAATAAGACCCAAAGTGAGG-3').The sequenced region begins at nucleotide 747 in the full-length sequence of the viral RNA segment 4, where nucleotides 747-749 encode HA1 amino acid 222. The most common wild-type codon in this position is GAT, which encodes aspartic acid (D). The GAA codon while GGT (or GGA) gives glycine (G). Mutation of G to A in the first position of the GAT codon gives asparagine (N). The viruses were also analysed for oseltamivir suscep - tibility by detecting the H274Y mutation by sequence analysis, through either a pyrosequencing assay targeting the relevant single-point mutation [31] or through full- or partial-length cycle sequencing of the coding region for the viral neuraminidase. Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis was performed on aligned sequences comprising the entire coding region of the HA1 subunit. Kimura 2-parameter corrected pairwise distances using the PHYLIP [32] program DNADIST, and the phylogenetic tree inferred using NEIGHBOR. The resulting tree was visualised using MEGA version 5.0 [33]. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was undertaken using PASW 17, version 17.02 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, United States). Descriptive statistics were calculated as medians with upper and lower range or as means with 95% confi - dence intervals. All hypothesis tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was assessed at the 0.05 level. Comparisons of categorical variables were per - formed using Fisher's exact test and comparisons of non-normal continuous distributions using the Mann- Whitney U test. Results In total, 462 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases where the HA1 222 genotype could be ascertained in the primary specimen were included in the study. A large propor - tion of the isolated viruses were sent to the WHO Collaborative Centre for Reference and Research on influenza in the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, United Kingdom, for further characterisation. No changes in virus antigenicity were found (data not shown). We did not find the H274Y mutation, commonly associated with oseltamivir resistance, in any of the viruses in this study. In phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 coding region of Norwegian viruses (Figure 1), the five 222G harbouring viruses for which we could ascer - tain the full HA1 coding sequence occurred on different branches of the tree, showing that they did not form a distinct genetic cluster. This is in good agreement with the fact that the cases with 222G viruses occurred spo - radically across Norway, at different times during the period of widespread virus circulation. Of the 462 cases included in the analysis, 381 had mild disease, 52 had severe disease but were non-fatal and 26 were fatal (clinical outcome was unknown for three cases). The median age of the cases with mild disease included was 20 years (range: 0-87), for the non-fatal cases with severe disease 27 years (range: 0-66 years) and for the fatal cases 38 years (range: 0-71). Among all 462 cases, 225 (49%) were men and 237 (51%) were women. The proportion of men versus women was similar for mild cases (48% vs 52%), severe non-fatal cases (52% vs 48%) and fatal cases (46% vs 54%). Of the 13 cases with 222G virus, eight were men and five were women: these proportions (62% vs 38%) were not 64 www.eurosurveillance.orgsignificantly different from those with non-222G viruses (48% vs 52%, n=449) (p=0.41, Fisher's exact test). In the total data set, 13 cases harboured 222G viruses, 222E occurred in 59 cases and 222N in four cases (one additional case contained both 222G and 222N qua - sispecies, and was classified as the former). In 386 cases we detected only wild-type 222D viruses (Table 2). The presence of mutants found in the pyrosequenc - ing assay was verified by conventional sequencing in all 10 cases where sequencing of primary samples was possible. In order to avoid bias stemming from preferential test - ing of severe cases in our samples, the prevalence of different genetic variants was recorded within each clinical outcome group, instead of the other way round. Among the 26 fatal cases, eight harboured the 222G virus at some time during the course of infection. The corresponding proportion for severe non-fatal cases was 5/52 (10 %) while none was found in 381 analysed cases with mild disease. The proportions in fatal as well as in severe non-fatal cases were higher than in mild cases (p<0.0005). Furthermore, the higher fre - quency in fatal cases compared with severe non-fatal cases was also statistically significant (p=0.026, Fisher's exact test). One specimen from a fatal case contained both 222G and 222N viruses in addition to wild-type 222D. Two of the 222G mutants had adenine in the third codon position and thus are likely to have arisen from 222E viruses. The prevalence of the 222E variant showed no significant difference between the various clinical out - come groups, and this variant represents a circulating clade with no apparent effect on virulence [9.10]. In the majority of 222G cases (11/13), the 222G mutants occurred as quasispecies, typically with wild type 222D sequence being more frequent (exemplified in Figure 2). The proportion of mutant virus in mixed populations as estimated by pyrosequencing tended to be less than 50% (range: 18-59). In all 10 cases analysed by both conventional sequencing and pyrosequencing, these mixtures were also evident as double peaks in conven - tional sequencing (see example in Figure 2). In eight cases, paired specimens from upper and lower respiratory tract were available for analysis. Six of these cases had a fatal outcome. These specimen pairs were collected on the same day from the same patients. Upper/lower respiratory tract specimens from the same case but collected on different days were not considered as pairs in this analysis. Both 222D and 222G viruses were found in the samples, but in all eight pairs, the HA1 222 genotype in the upper and lower respiratory tract samples matched (Table 3).Table 2 Prevalence of haemagglutinin gene (HA1) 222 genotypes by clinical outcome (mild, severe non-fatal, fatal disease), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases, Norway, 2009/10 (n=462) n (%)Fatal n (%)Severe including fatal n (%)Unknown n (%) 222D wild type 329 (86.4) 40 (76.9) 15 (57.7) 55 (70.5) 2 (66.7) 386 (83.5) 222G 0 (0) 5 (9.6) 8 (30.8) 13 (16.7) 0 (0) 13 (2.8) 222E 51 (13.4) 5 (9.6) 2 (7.7) 7 (9.0) 1 ( 33.3) 59 (12.8) 222N 1 (0.3) 2 (3.8) 1 (3.8)b3 (3.8)b0 (0) 4 (0.9)b Total 381 (100) 52 (100) 26 (100) 78 (100) 3 (100) 462 (100) a Severe non-fatal and fatal cases are shown separately and jointly. b Additionally, one fatal 222G case harboured 222N virus as a quasispecies.

In four of these patients (Cases 2, 5, 6 and 8 in Figure 3), we found only 222D wild type viruses in sam - ples preceding detection of 222G mutant virus. In one patient (Case 1 in Figure 3), both available samples contained 222G mutant virus, but the samples were taken only one day apart, thus reducing the chance of finding differing genotypes. We also had serial sam - ples for three additional non-222G patients (Cases 3, 4 and 7 in Figure 3) who exhibited the same genotype throughout the course of illness (either 222D or 222N). The date of symptom onset was given for 263 cases: 212 mild, 33 severe non-fatal and 18 fatal. Specimens from the mild cases tended to be collected earlier in the course of illness (mean: 4.3 days after symptom onset; 95% CI: 3.7-4.9) than specimens collected from all severe cases (mean: 6.5 days; 95% CI: 5.2-7.8) (p=0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). proportion of 222G mutant viruses was higher in speci - mens collected late (8 days after symptom onset) than in those collected early (<8 days after symptom onset) (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test). Among specimens col - lected on day 8 or later, more than half were from mild cases (20/39) and there was still a significantly higher proportion of mutant virus in the severe cases, includ - ing those that were fatal (6/19 vs 0/20) (p=0.008, Fisher's exact test) (Table 4). As noted earlier, the median age of the cases included was higher among all the severe cases, including those that were fatal, than the mild cases (p<0.0005, Mann-Whitney U test). The proportion of 222G mutant viruses was higher in specimens collected from patients aged 40 years or older than in younger patients (8.2% (7/85) vs 1.6% (6/371), p=0.004, Fisher's exact test). However, among specimens collected from patients aged 40 years or above, there was still a significantly higher pro - portion of mutant viruses in the severe cases, includ - ing those that were fatal (p<0.0005, Fisher's exact test, data not shown). Thus, the observed difference in 222G prevalence between the different clinical out - come groups is not due to age as a confounding factor. Discussion In the present study, we provide further epidemiologi - cal evidence of the association between the D222G mutation in HA1 of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and severe or fatal clinical course. Furthermore, we present evidence that the mutated viruses emerge in individual patients after the onset of illness and demonstrate the presence of mutant virus in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. We also address some potential biases that could conceivably confound the analysis. The Norwegian cases of infection with HA1 222G geno - type viruses have occurred sporadically and do not cluster epidemiologically or in phylogenetic analysis. As observed by others, the D222G substitution has been observed to occur sporadically in the labora - tory when specimens containing predominantly wild- type virus are subjected to virus isolation in eggs or mammalian cell lines [6,13,35].We therefore based our analysis on viral sequences obtained from the primary clinical specimens. The 222G viruses appear to be rare among circulat - ing strains, but are still quite frequent in patients with severe disease, who are not epidemiologically linked. A likely explanation is that the presence of mutant viruses in these particular individuals experiencing severe disease is due to selective upgrowth of mutant genomes during infection. In all four 222G cases where we could analyse both early and late specimens, we observed a transition from wild-type to mutant virus, which lends support to the hypothesis that the pres - ence of the mutant is due to sporadic emergence rather than widespread circulation. In our analysis, we could not distinguish between upgrowth from a rare quasispecies, which may be present at inapparent levels in many more cases, and Table 4 Prevalence of haemagglutinin gene (HA1) 222 genotypes in viruses from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases sampled late in illness (day 8 or later), by clinical outcome, Norway, 2009/10 (n=39) HA1 222genotypeSpecimens from cases taken on day 8 or later a Mild n (%)Severe n (%)Fatal n (%)Severe including fatal n (%)Total n (%) 222D 17 (85) 8 (73) 3 (38) 11 (58) 28 (72) 222G 0 (0) 3 (27) 3 (38) 6 (32) 6 (15) 222E 3 (15) 0 (0) 1 (13) 1 (5) 4 (10) 222N 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (13) 1 (5) 1 (3) Total 20 (100) 11 (100) 8 (100) 19 (100) 39 (100) a Severe non-fatal and fatal cases are shown separately and jointly.68 www.eurosurveillance.orgupgrowth from de novo mutation events. The 222G genotype appears to occur as sporadic mutations with no or little onward transmission, rather than through persistence as a circulating variant. If this is the case, the likelihood of finding mutant viruses is expected to increase during the course of infection. Conceivably, since the severe cases, including those that were fatal, tended to be sampled later in their course of illness than mild cases, the higher occurrence of mutations could alternatively be explained purely as a sam - pling artefact and not as a marker of virulence. But if the occurrence of the mutation was merely a func - tion of time since infection, there should be no differ - ence in the frequency of 222G mutant in specimens from mild versus severe cases, if taken equally late in infection. Our results show that the significant dif - ference remained even when all early specimens were excluded: thus the difference in sampling day can be ruled out as an alternative explanation for the pattern observed (Table 4). In several of the cases, simultaneous specimens were available from different body locations. In all of these pairs/sets, the same genotypes were observed, but with differences in the ratio of mutant versus wild type in patients harbouring quasispecies. Other studies have identified D222G cheal aspirate or broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) sam - ples and less frequently in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples [12,14,20]. This discrepancy could be due to the use of different analytical methods. Lower rates of mutant versus wild type in nasal swabs may not have been revealed by conventional sequencing. This was demonstrated by Baldanti et al. [14] in D222G/N cases with available paired nasal swabs and BAL samples, the authors found D222G/N in only one of four cases using direct sequencing, but this proportion increased to three of four cases using clonal analysis. From our study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the occur - rence of the mutation as a quasispecies, together with the wild-type, is due to a complementary function of the wild-type. This phenomenon might change if the mutant virus were to develop another fitness-compen - satory mutation that permits the mutant to replicate and spread in pure form. This possibility needs to be further studied. In addition to its possible biological importance the fact that the majority of the cases with 222G mutants carried a mixture of 222D- and 222G-encoding viral genomes, usually with predominance of the wild-type 222D, makes it likely that many influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases worldwide carrying D222G mutant viruses could have been missed in analyses that are not sensitive to minor nucleic acid species or where only the majority nucleotide is recorded in the pub - lished sequence. Selleri et al. analysed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viral Codon in patients by ultra-deep pyrosequencing and in only 7.1% by con - ventional sequencing. They found that the frequency of polymorphism was significantly higher in samples col - lected from patients with severe manifestations than in those patients with moderate-mild manifestations. The D222G/N/A mutations were detected as either minor or predominant variants only in severe cases, whereas D222E was equally represented in severe and moder - ate-mild infections. The question whether the presence of mutant viruses in lower airways is underestimated due to lack of sam - pling in the lower respiratory tract was investigated by Baldanti et al. [14 ] paired nasal swabs and BAL sam - ples from patients admitted to intensive care units for mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal mem - brane oxygenation were compared with samples from patients with pneumonia not requiring mechanical ven - tilation and from community patients. By combining data from nasal swabs and BAL samples, the frequency of D222G/N mutants in patients with severe infections increased to 43%, as compared with 7.8% and 0% in patients with moderate and mild infections, respec - tively [14]. Baldanti et al. also showed that the viral RNA levels were significantly higher in BAL samples than those in nasal swabs [14]. Piralla et al. described the same finding, suggesting higher virus replication in the lower respiratory tract [20]. Watanabe et al. have characterised two of the Norwegian virus isolates included in our study, namely A/Norway/3568/2009 (Norway3568) and A/Norway/3487-2/2009 (Norway3487) [34]. The viruses were isolates from a fatal case (Norway3487) and a mild case (Norway3568): the viruses differ by only 10 amino acids and none of the amino acid changes known to affect virulence were found in PB2, PB1-F2, HA, or NS1, except for an amino acid change to 222G in HA1, in Norway3487. More efficient viral replication in cultured cells and delayed virus clearance from fer - ret respiratory organs was observed for Norway3487 virus (isolated from a severe case), as compared with Norway3568 (isolated from a mild case). To some extent, Norway3487 virus caused more severe lung damage in non-human primates than did Norway3568 virus. Moreover, the authors found that PB2 derived from Norway3487 contributed to higher polymerase activity, possibly leading to more efficient viral replica - tion in vitro and in vivo, which in turn also could play a role in the increased lung damage. In our analysis, all cases with detectable 222G mutant viruses had severe illness and the prevalence of 222G increased with the degree of severe outcome. If the conditions for virus growth in lower airways are favour - able to 222G mutants and the likelihood of upgrowth of mutant virus increases with duration of infection, it fol - lows that individuals who fail to limit infection to upper airways and fail to eliminate the infection rapidly stand at greater risk of acquiring mutant viruses. Regardless 69 www.eurosurveillance.orgof virulence, such a mechanism may contribute to the observed pattern of mutants being found primarily in severe cases. However, if the mutant viruses are also more virulent, an increased probability of emergence in patients who already have a long-lasting infection involving the lower respiratory tract probably consti - tutes a vicious circle phenomenon, which underscores the importance of treatment that helps persons with elevated risk to clear the infection rapidly. The concept of D222G being a determinant of virulence is supported by a growing body of evidence from in vitro and animal studies including non-human primates [36-45]. Increased tropism of D222G mutant virus for type II pneumocytes [44] may result in more efficient infection, reducing the availability of progenitor cells for essential lung functions and regeneration and thus leading to severe pulmonary impairment. Increased viral titres in the lungs also trigger stronger inflamma - tory responses, augmenting tissue damage and delay - ing healing in the infected lungs [44]. While one instance of transmission of 222G mutant virus has been documented [9], the transmitted virus in this case had acquired an additional mutation, (G155E) that may have counteracted the putative 222G-induced receptor-binding changes [46] and there are no indica - tions that effective sustained transmission has taken place. In our data set, one of the patients with mutant viruses was the likely source of infection of a health - care worker. However, this occurred early in the course of illness: virus from an early specimen, as well as the virus collected from the healthcare worker, was wild type. In light of the fact that 222G mutant viruses are and remain substantially less transmissible than cor - responding wild-type viruses, their immediate pub - lic health impact is limited to the individual cases in whom such mutants occur and the fact that they may possibly contribute to the severity of illness. Similar to the apparent situation with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in humans, tropism of 222G mutant viruses for lung cells may contribute to both increased virulence and impaired transmissibility, which may thus be linked traits [47]. On the other hand, when the H275Y neuraminidase mutation conferring oseltami - vir resistance in seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses was first identified, this mutation also correlated with impaired viral fitness [48], a situation that was abruptly changed with the global emergence of high-fitness resistant viruses during the 2007/08 influenza season [49]. Similarly, further adaption of the newly emerged A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to humans as host spe - cies may conceivably lead to compensatory mutations that render the 222G mutants more transmissible, or lead to other changes that influence pathogenicity. The evolution of these viruses therefore needs to be closely monitored in a framework that ensures that virological and clinical data are taken into account.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20358 Article submited on 31 August 2012 / published on 17 January 2013 Treatment of gonorrhoea is threatened by antimi - crobial resistance, and decreased susceptibility and resistance to recommended therapies is emerging in Europe. Current associations between resistance and molecular type remain poorly understood. Gonococcal isolates (n=1,066) collected for the 2009 and 2010 European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme were typed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). A total of 406 sequence types (STs) were identified, 125 of which occurred in two isolates. Seven major genogroups of closely related STs (varying by 1% at just one of the two target loci) were defined. Genogroup 1407 (G1407), observed in 20/21 countries and predominant in 13/21 countries, accounted for 23% of all isolates and was associated with decreased susceptibility to cefixime and resistance to ciprofloxacin and raised minimum inhibitory concentrations for ceftriaxone and azithro mycin. Genogroup 225 (G225), associated with cipro - floxacin resistance, was observed in 10% of isolates from 19/21 countries. None of the other genogroups were associated with antimicrobial resistance. The predominance of a multidrug-resistant clone (G1407) in Europe is worrying given the recent reports of rec - ommended third generation cephalosporins failing to treat infections with this clone. Identifying associa - tions between ST and antimicrobial resistance aids the understanding of the dissemination of resistant clones within a population and could facilitate development of targeted intervention strategies. Introduction Gonorrhoea continues to present a public health prob - lem within the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). In 2010, a total of 32,028 cases of gon - orrhoea were reported by 28 European countries, giv - ing a rate of 10.4 per 100,000 population [1]. Given the serious implications of gonococcal infection, which include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, early abortion and a fivefold increase in risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmis - sion [2], the need for effective treatment and control of gonorrhoea is evident. A significant challenge to this is that during the antibiotic era, the aetiological agent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae , has consistently developed resistance to each antibiotic introduced for widespread empirical treatment [3]. Empirical treatment of gonorrhoea is based on national or regional guidelines, many of which currently rec - ommend third generation cephalosporins as first line therapy. Up until late in 2012, guidelines for Europe recommend 250 mg of ceftriaxone as a single intra - muscular dose or 400 mg of cefixime as a single oral dose [4]. These were recently revised to recommend 500mg ceftriaxone combined with 2g azithromycin [5] in response to growing evidence that cephalosporin therapy is becoming compromised by the emergence of isolates exhibiting decreased susceptibility and resist - ance to the third generation cephalosporins, which have now caused treatment failure in several EU/EEA countries [6-11]. In 2010, the European gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility programme (Euro-GASP) demonstrated that 9% of isolates from 21 European countries showed decreased susceptibility to cefix - ime as well as an increasing trend in minimum inhibi - tory concentrations (MICs) for ceftriaxone, and a high prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin (53%) and azithromycin (7%) [12]. In the absence of any alterna - tive antimicrobial treatments, there is clearly an urgent need to develop strategies to limit dissemination of resistant strains to maintain effective treatment. Molecular epidemiological surveillance has the capac - ity to provide novel information on the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant gonococcal 72 www.eurosurveillance.orgclones which might facilitate appropriate patient management and targeted intervention strategies. Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typ - ing (NG-MAST) is highly discriminatory, reproducible, objective and transferrable and is well suited to appli - cations aiming to answer short term epidemiological questions. Several studies have applied NG-MAST to characterise gonococci exhibiting decreased suscepti - bility and resistance to various antimicrobials including the third generation cephalosporins [13-21]. However molecular epidemiological surveillance of consecutive isolates of all antimicrobial phenotypes within a pop - ulation is necessary to explore associations between genotype and antimicrobial resistance profile and to fully understand how resistant strains emerge and dis - seminate. While several such surveys have been con - ducted within individual countries in the EU/EEA [22-25] and elsewhere [26-28], most examined gonococcal populations had been collected in 2008 or earlier and, accordingly, associations between sequence type (ST) and antimicrobial susceptibility may no longer be valid. Furthermore examples of decreased susceptibility to recommended third generation cephalosporins were in most cases not circulating in the gonococcal popula - tion examined at the time of sampling. The current study aimed to assess the public health benefit of NG-MAST molecular epidemiological typing of gonococcal isolates as part of Euro-GASP. Methods Isolate collection N. gonorrhoeae isolates were selected from the most recent sampling period (2010) within Euro-GASP. The sampling strategy for this multi-centre sentinel sur - veillance scheme has been described previously [12]. Briefly, countries are requested to submit 55 consecu - tive gonococcal isolates twice annually (in May/June and November/December) aiming as far as possible to provide isolates representative of the national distribu - tion of cases of gonorrhoea. Where available, countries submitted information on date specimen obtained, specimen site, sex of patient, age, sexual orientation, previously diagnosed with gonorrhoea, and concurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosed in this episode. A total of 1,066 isolates were selected for molecular epidemiological typing from 21 EU/EEA countries. The criteria for selection were that isolates were consecu - tive to ensure no bias in antimicrobial susceptibility, and that a full antimicrobial resistance profile had been determined as part of EUR0-GASP. Most (n=828; 78%) were solely from the first sampling period in May/June 2010 in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK). Isolates were selected from this sampling period for all other participating coun - tries but further isolates (n=139; 13%) were additionally selected from the second sampling period (November/December 2010) for countries submitting low numbers (<50 isolates in the first collection period): Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Romania and Slovakia. The remaining 100 isolates (9%) were additionally selected from 2009 for countries submitting very low numbers (<50 isolates from both sampling periods in 2010) (Latvia, Malta, Slovenia) or for countries where isolates from the second sampling period in 2010 were unavail - able and <50 isolates had been submitted in the first sampling period of 2010 (Portugal, Norway and Spain). As Cyprus, Hungary and Romania did not participate in EURO-GASP 2009, only very low numbers (17) were available from 2010 for inclusion in the current study. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing Gonococcal isolates from each country were submitted on Microbank beads (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Cheshire, UK) frozen on dry ice to one of three centres (the Health Protection Agency, UK, \u00d6rebro University Hospital, Sweden and the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) for centralised susceptibility testing. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and spectinomycin by a previously decribed breakpoint MICs were determined by agar dilution as described [12,29] and by cefix - ime and ceftriaxone (AB Biomerieux, Solna, Sweden). The MIC was confirmed by Etest for any isolates resist - ant to azithromycin by the breakpoint method or show - ing gentamicin MICs>8 mg/L. All isolates were also tested for the chromog - enic reagent of Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence types Permission to type isolates submitted for suscep - tibility testing was obtained from all participating laboratories. All typing was performed at either the Health Protection Agency, UK, or at \u00d6rebro University Hospital, Sweden. Isolates originally referred to the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark for susceptibility testing were sent frozen on Microbank beads to the Health Protection Agency, London, UK for typing. A total of 1,066 isolates were typed as described [30] by NG-MAST, which differentiates strains on the basis of sequence variation in fragments of two hypervariable genes, the porin PorB ( porB ) protein ( tbpB ) gene. Allele numbers and STs, including any new alleles or STs were assigned via the online NG-MAST database (www.ng-mast.net). The alleles defining the most frequently observed STs (represented by 10 isolates or more), were com - pared against all alleles in the dataset to determine if predominant STs were part of a wider collection of closely related types. Similarity of alleles was evalu - ated in BioNumerics v6.1 by neighbour joining multiple alignment, followed by individual pairwise alignment against the most frequent allele to determine number of base pair (bp) differences. For example, for ST1407 (porB 908, tbpB 110), all porB alleles from isolates 73 www.eurosurveillance.orgwith tbpB allele 110 were compared for similarity to porB allele 908, and all tbpB alleles from isolates containing porB allele 908 were compared for similar - ity to tbpB allele 110. Different STs were assigned to a 'genogroup', if one identical allele was shared and the other allele showed 99% similarity (5 bp difference for porB and 4 bp for tbpB ). Genogroups were named using the letter G followed by the number of the pre - dominant ST within each group. For example G1407 is the genogroup in which ST1407 is the predominant ST. Statistical analyses Potential associations between genogroups and (i) antimicrobial susceptibilities and (ii) patient character - istics (sex, age and sexual orientation) were explored firstly by univariate analysis and then where appropri - ate by multivariate analysis using STATA v11.2. For this analysis, patients were subdivided into age groups (0-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years or 45 years). Most of the patients in the 0-24 year age group were aged 15-24 years (99%; 360/363), while the remaining three patients were aged 0-7 years.For the univariate analysis, crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where datasets contained sufficient numbers. A Pearson chi-squared test was used to test if these ORs were significantly different from one (i.e. testing the null hypothesis that there was no difference in odds of resistance/decreased susceptibility between the group in question and the specified baseline group). For data - sets where a cell equalled zero, this analysis could not be performed. In these cases of small cell numbers, Fisher's exact test was performed. The multivariate analysis used logistic regression to model the odds of associations between genogroup and resistance controlling for other variables. The P value produced from the Wald test was used to test the null hypothesis that the odds ratios were not signifi - cantly different from one.Table 1 Most frequently observed Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence types in each country, and frequency of the three most common among all isolates (n=1,066), EU/EEA countries, 2009-2010 Country Most frequent ST STs n ST1407 n (%) ST2992 n (%) ST225 n (%) Isolates typed n Austria ST1407 20 16 (32) 2 (4) 0 (0) 50 Belgium ST1407 31 7 (14) 4 (8) 1 (2) 50 Cyprus ST3128 5 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 12 Denmark ST225/3158 36 3 (6) 1 (2) 6 (12) 50 France ST2/2992 27 4 (8) 7 (14) 2 (4) 50 Germany ST25 18 14 (28) 0 (0) 0 (0) 50 Greece ST5405a/5505a24 6 (12) 0 (0) 1 (2) 50 Hungary ST5332a10 2 (12) 0 (0) 0 (0) 17 Ireland ST2992 25 3 (6) 16 (32) 0 (0) 50 Italy ST1407 25 17 (34) 5 (10) 0 (0) 50 Latvia ST3227 14 0 (0) 0 (0) 2 (7) 29 Malta ST225 16 3 (6) 1 (2) 23 (46) 50 Netherlands ST1407 52 16 (16) 7 (7) 3 (3) 100 Norway ST2992 26 7 (14) 11 (22) 0 (0) 49 Portugal ST1407 28 7 (14) 4 (8) 0 (0) 50 Romania ST1407/4120 7 2 (22) 0 (0) 0 (0) 9 Slovakia ST437 19 2 (4) 0 (0) 0 (0) 50 Slovenia ST1407 19 14 (28) 2 (4) 8 (16) 50 Spain ST1407 43 28 (28) 9 (9) 0 (0) 100 Sweden ST225 31 1 (2) 3 (6) 4 (8) 50 United Kingdom ST1407 62 14 (14) 4 (4) 0 (0) 100 Total N (%) 166 (16) 76 (7) 50 (5) 1,066 (100) EEA: European Economic Area; EU: European Union; of Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence types Of the 1,066 isolates typed, 406 different STs were identified, representing 313 porB alleles and 113 tbpB alleles. One hundred and twenty five clusters (2 iso - lates with the same ST) and 281 STs represented by a single isolate were identified, and 216 new STs defined. The most frequently observed types (represented by 10 isolates) were STs 1407 (n=166), new STs. Of these, all had unique porB alleles but some STs shared the same tbpB allele (STs 1407 and 5595, STs 225 and 437, STs 2292 and 359 and STs 387 and 3227 shared, respectively, tbpB alleles 110, 4, 29 and 118). The prevalence of the three most common STs (1407, 2992 and 225) varied between countries (Table 1). ST1407 accounted for >10% of isolates in 13/21 coun - tries, whereas ST2992 and ST225 were observed in >10% of isolates in 3/21 countries in both cases (Table 1). ST1407 was the most frequent ST observed in Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the UK (Table 1). Definition and frequency of Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing genogroups Further analysis of the porB and tbpB alleles of the STs observed in 10 isolates showed that several other STs within the total collection were highly related to these, sharing one identical allele and differing by 1% at the other allele (in most cases, the 2), encompassing 557 (52%) of isolates. The remaining 509 isolates were represented by 313 STs, of which only STs 5405 (n=10), in 5 isolates. The largest and most diverse genogroups were G1407, comprising ST1407 and 25 STs differing by 5 bp in the porB allele and two STs by 1 bp in tbpB , and G225 comprising ST225 and 28 other STs differing by 5 bp at the porB locus (Table 2). Distribution of Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi- antigen sequence typing genogroups G1407 was observed in all countries examined, with the exception of Latvia, and was the most frequent type, observed in 15-50% of isolates from Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, England and Wales, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the Netherlands (Figure). In contrast G1407 was comparatively uncommon (8%) in France, Ireland, Malta and Sweden (Figure). G225 was observed in 19/21 countries and was the most frequently observed type in Malta and Sweden and was most common after Table 2 Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence types within the seven major genogroups defined based on sequence similarity at porB and EU/EEA 5423 (2), 2616 (2), 3150 (2), 5180 (2), 205 (1), 346 (1), 1342 (1), 1365 (1), 1399 (1), 2687 (7), 3003 (4), 356 (3), 4589 (2), 5384 (2), 273 (1), 881 (1), 5424 (1), 807 (1), 5341 (1), 4338 (1), (1), (1), (1) 1929 (2), 5485 (1), 1313 (1) binding protein subunit B. a The percentages are calculated from a total of 1,066 isolates. b STs that share an identical tbpB allele with the most frequent ST within the genogroup but vary at the porB allele. c STs that share an identical porB allele with the most frequent ST within the genogroup but vary at the tbpB allele.76 www.eurosurveillance.orgG1407 in Denmark, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, accounting for 14-30% of isolates (Figure). G2992 was observed in 14/21 countries and predominated in Ireland and Norway, while G25 predominated in Germany (Figure). Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing genogroups and epidemiological characteristics of linked patients The most frequently collected variables were age and sex, known for 1,030 and 1,050 patients, respectively. Sexual orientation was known for only 586 patients (478 males and 108 females) (Table 3). Statistical analysis showed there was no clear associa - tion with age category for most genogroups, with the exception of G1407 which was significantly less com - mon in patients aged <25 years (OR: 0.43; p<0.0001, chi-squared test), whereas G2 was in this younger group (OR: 15.63; p=0.0004, chi-squared test). The proportion of males significantly lower for G25 test). Where sex - ual orientation was known, statistical associations were observed between men who have sex with men (MSM) and infection with with G1407 were heterosexual (Table 3). MSM were less multi-antigen ing genogroups or sequence types and antimicrobial resistance The consensus antimicrobial susceptibility category or modal MIC was calculated for all genogroups/STs rep - resented by 10 isolates (Table 4). Most deviation from the consensus was observed for azithromycin, which supplementary testing by Etest showed was due to iso - lates exhibiting MICs close to the breakpoint for resist - ance (1.0 mg/L). The modal cefixime MIC was raised for G1407 compared with other genogroups (Table 4), with 77/248 isolates (31%) showing decreased susceptibility to cefixime while MICs The association between G1407 cefixime was highly significant (OR: 17.9; p<0.0001, chi-squared test) by univariate analysis and by multivariate analysis to control for patient age, sex and sexual orientation (OR: 31.2; p<0.0001, chi-squared test). There were no exam - ples of decreased ceftriaxone susceptibility (MIC >0.125 mg/L), but the modal MIC was raised for G1407 com - pared with other genogroups (Table 4). All isolates of G1407 were ciprofloxacin resistant (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). While the consensus azithromycin suscep - tibility for G1407 was sensitive, the proportion of iso - lates showing MICs just above the breakpoint and so in the resistant category was significant after control - ling for patients age, sex and sexual orientation (OR: 11.5; p<0.0001, chi-squared test). Decreased cefixime susceptibility was observed in a further nine STs rep - resenting 10 isolates in the total study population. Of these, seven isolates shared tbpB allele 110 but the six porB alleles differed from allele 908 by >5 bp. One iso - late possessed porB allele 908 but differed markedly at the tbpB allele from 110. The STs of the remaining two isolates (STs 3168 and 5606) appeared unrelated to ST1407. All isolates belonging to G225 were resistant to cipro - floxacin, indicating a statistically significant associa - tion by Fisher's exact test (p<0.0001). All ten isolates of ST5405 were resistant to ciprofloxacin also (Table 4), significant association by Fisher's exact test (p=0.0032). Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study to supplement a regional antimicrobial resistance surveillance pro - gramme with molecular typing to provide enhanced surveillance of gonorrhoea. This approach has not only provided novel information on NG-MAST STs circulat - ing in 21 of the 30 EU/EEA countries, but also provides insight into the dissemination of antimicrobial resist - ant gonococcal clones within the region. While considerable diversity of gonococcal STs exists both within and between countries, some STs pre - dominate, and this is even more apparent if STs are grouped into genogroups to facilitate robust statistical analyses. Most notably, G1407 accounted for 23% of isolates overall, and predominated in 13/21 countries. Relatedness of NG-MAST STs has been considered in comparatively few studies and multiple approaches are described [14,15,21,25,31,32]. Failure to consider relatedness of STs could lead to the prevalence of clonal groups being underestimated and reduces the power of any statistical analyses exploring associa - tions between organism and/or patient characteristics and STs. Our approach was to consider strains highly related if strains varied at just one allele by 1%. Use of such a high cut-off ensures only very closely related strains are clustered, but given the variation in approaches described thus far, there is a need to agree a standard approach in the near future to allow compa - rability between studies. Most molecular surveys of consecutive gonococcal iso - lates from earlier sampling periods ranging between 2003 to 2005 did not demonstrate predominance of ST1407 or related types in individual European coun - tries [24,25,33,34] or elsewhere [26,28]. In contrast ST1407 was documented in more recent surveys in Portugal [25] and Norway [23], and a centre that 77 www.eurosurveillance.orgperforms molecular typing of all cases of gonorrhoea in Scotland showed that ST1407 first emerged in 2007 and by 2009 accounted for 15.4% of cases [35]. The current study provides further evidence that the wide dissemination of ST1407 in the EU is likely to be a recent phenomenon. ST1407 and related STs are known to be distributed globally, documented in stud - ies specifically investigating decreased susceptibility and resistance to third generation cephalosporins, in Europe [6,9,13,14,19], the United States [20], Canada [21], Australia [18], Hong Kong [17] and Taiwan [36] and in a survey conducted in Japan [27]. ST1407 has also caused most of the treatment failures with third gen - eration cephalosporins in EU/EEA countries [6-11]. Our study demonstrates that there appear to be no isolates of G1407 that are highly sensitive to cefixime, with 96% of isolates showing MICs 0.06mg/L, and presents the first clear evidence that all G1407 iso - lates circulating currently in the general gonococcal population in the EU/EEA are ciprofloxacin resistant, strongly associated with decreased susceptibility/resistance to cefixime and show raised MICs for ceftri - axone and azithromycin. This highlights the potential of molecular epidemiological typing as a tool to predict antimicrobial resistance, as it is evident that ciproflox - acin and cefixime in particular would be inappropriate regimes to treat G1407 infection. Two isolates were identified that exhibited decreased susceptibility to cefixime but were considered unrelated to G1407. The low incidence of these types may suggest they repre - sent less biologically fit gonococcal clones and/or have recently been imported from regions such as the Far East, where greater diversity in STs showing cefixime decreased susceptibility is reported [15-17,36]. ST1407 is known to be part of a major globally predominant clone, multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST1901 which probably originated in Japan [11], and recent analy - sis of ten additional genomic markers has provided further evidence of the clonal nature of ST1407 and closely related NG-MAST STs [32]. MLST ST7363 is also reported as a major clone associated with decreased susceptibility and resistance to cephalosporins, which also has shown its ability to develop high-level resist - ance to cefixime and ceftriaxone [37]. MLST was not performed in the current study but is an excellent means of determining longer-term evolutionary rela - tionships between strains [38] and so could help to resolve the lineage of these non-G1407 isolates.

One ST1407 isolate with treatment failure using cefixime, has been described from France [11]. This strain demonstrates that the ST1407 clone can by a single additional muta - tion in its penicillin-binding protein 2 ( penA ) mosaic gene develop high-level resistance to both cefixime and ceftriaxone, which is the last remaining option for single antimicrobial empiric treatment of gonorrhoea [11]. The observed predominance of ST1407 and related STs in many EU/EEA countries is therefore worrying given their potential to be therapeutically challenging. While shown to be associated with MSM, it is evident that G1407 is circulating in the heterosexual popula - tion also and, accordingly, the risk of future treatment failure is not restricted to any one patient group. G1407 therefore represents a potential major public health problem if it continues to disseminate without any measures taken to restrict this. G225 was the most prevalent genogroup after G1407 in the current study. ST225 has been reported as a highly prevalent strain in EU/EEA countries [22,25,33,34], with a confirmed association with ciprofloxacin resistance [22,25,33]. Given that most studies began sampling as early as 2003 to 2005, the continued persistence of G225 by 2010 indicates that it is a highly successful, stable NG-MAST clone. Interestingly, a recent Canadian study of isolates showing decreased susceptibility to cefixime and/or ceftriaxone showed that 19% of iso - lates were ST225 [21]. All isolates of G225 in the current study were sensitive to cefixime and ceftriaxone, but the potential for this strain to show decreased suscep - tibility is of concern given its potential to predominate and persist. While strong associations between ST225 and MSM are reported [25,34], these were not con - firmed in all studies [39] including this one. This could indicate a shift in the distribution of G225 since the earlier typing studies, with possible bridging between homosexual and heterosexual networks. It is acknowl - edged however that the completeness of the sexual ori - entation variable in the current study was low, which may have introduced a bias into this analysis. None of the other major genogroups defined in the current study showed an association with resistance to the antimicrobials tested, but G2, G25, G359 and G387 would appear to be particularly persistent strains also, all having been reported in a molecular survey in 2004 [34]. Individual STs from these groups have been reported in other studies which confirmed that these were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested [22,25,33]. As observed previously [34], genogroups G2, G25 and G387 were associated with heterosex - ual patients, demonstrating their persistence within this patient population. In contrast other genogroups (G2992, G1407) were shown to be associated with MSM. While ST1407 has been reported in a high pro - portion of MSM previously [13], to our knowledge this is the first time ST2992 and related types has been reported as a potentially MSM associated type. None of the molecular epidemiological surveys conducted to date have reported ST2992 as a prevalent ST [24-26,28,33,34]. G2992 accounted for 8% of all isolates in our study and while widely distributed, it was particu - larly predominant in Ireland and Norway, which may indicate an outbreak within MSM, although further lon - gitudinal surveillance of a sufficiently representative sample would be required to verify this. In our study the selection criteria for isolates were based on accepting from each country consecutive isolates with a full antimicrobial profile. There were no exclusion criteria based on epidemiological char - acteristics and all patient ages were included. One of the age groups used for the analyses spanned 0 to 24 year-olds however only three of the 363 patients in this group were less than 15 years-old. The inclusion of isolates from the latter patients was valid for the anti - microbial resistance analyses. Only one of the three patients was related to a common genogroup (G225) therefore including these three patients should have had little effect on the overall statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study shows clear associations between antimicrobial resistance and molecular type. The use of molecular epidemiological typing to predict antimicrobial resistance and follow the spread of anti - microbial resistant gonococcal clones has added public health benefits as it can aid understanding of the dis - semination of resistance within a population and facili - tate development of targeted intervention strategies, for example by ensuring patients infected with strains likely to be therapeutically challenging are managed with aggressive therapy and test of cure. Additionally if the prediction of antimicrobial resistance was suffi - ciently reliable this approach could directly impact on appropriate management of patients for whom culture and associated antimicrobial susceptibility testing has not been performed. While it is acknowledged that sample representativeness is a limitation of the cur - rent study [12], additional molecular epidemiological typing has successfully demonstrated a 'proof of prin - ciple' that this approach could be valid and have real public health value. However for this to be effective, ongoing, frequent molecular typing surveillance will be essential, as there is continual potential for novel STs and novel antimicrobial susceptibility profiles to emerge. Future work should focus on longitudinal typ - ing of a representative sample to monitor stability of associations between ST and antimicrobial resistance and/or epidemiological characteristics, and to identify temporal changes and emergence of novel STs. 79 www.eurosurveillance.orgFunding This work was supported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (call for tender number OJ/2009/03/11-PROC/2009/006), which coordinates the European STI Expert Network, including the STI microbiol - ogy programme.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20367 Article submitted on 09 July 2012 / published on 17 January 2013 Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable- number tandem repeat typing alone was used to inves - tigate the genetic lineages among 361 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in Ireland over a two- year period, 2010 and 2011. The majority of isolates, 63% (229/361), belonged to lineage 4 (Euro-American), while lineages 1 (Indo-Oceanic), 2 (East-Asian) and 3 (East-African-Indian) represented 12% of isolates each (42/361, 45/361, and 45/361, respectively). Sub-lineages Beijing (lineage 2), East-African-Indian (lineage 1) and Delhi/central-Asian (lineage 3) pre - dominated among foreign-born cases, while a higher proportion of Euro-American lineages were identi - fied among cases born in Ireland. Eighteen molecu - lar clusters involving 63 tuberculosis (TB) cases were identified across four sub-lineages of lineage 4. While the mean cluster size was 3.5 TB cases, the largest cluster (involving 12 Irish-born cases) was identified in the Latin American-Mediterranean sub-lineage. Clustering of isolates was higher among Irish-born TB cases (47 of 63 clustered cases), whereas only one cluster (3/63) involved solely foreign-born individu - als. Four multidrug-resistant cases identified during this period represented lineages 2 and 4. This study provides the first insight into the structure of the M. tuberculosis population in Ireland. Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculo - sis remains a serious challenge to public health world - wide. Despite an overall decline in case notification rates for TB across Europe, rates vary significantly, with the highest rates reported from eastern Europe and the Baltic States [1]. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB contin - ues to be a major problem and an added burden in high-incidence countries such as Romania (108.2/100,000) and the Baltic states Lithuania (62.1/100,000), Latvia (43.2/100,000) and Estonia (30.7/100,000) [1]. Ireland has a low incidence, with notification rates that ranged between 9.7 and 11.3 per 100,000 population between 2001 and 2010 although to some extent this may have been influenced by migrants arriving from high-burden countries [1-2]. In Ireland, TB is a statutorily notifiable disease, and in a recent report on the epidemiology of TB in the country, the proportion of culture-confirmed TB cases was 71.2% in 2009 and 63.2% in 2010 (data from 2010 were not finalised at the time of submission) [3]. These proportions are similar to those reported for previous years [3]. Disruption of transmission chains is a key factor in controlling TB both at a national and international level [4]. In recent years, there have been significant advances in developing the molecular tools required for rapid diagnosis of TB [4]. Analysis of variable-num - ber tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences at mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) has emerged as a valuable marker for genotyping strains of the M. tuber - culosis complex [5]. In large population-based studies, MIRU-VNTR typing has been shown to have similar dis - criminatory power when compared to IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing [5-7]. An optimised set of 24 MIRU-VNTR markers has become the gold standard for genotyping M. tuberculosis complex strains worldwide [5,7]. MIRU-VNTR typing is a PCR-based method that yields rapid, reproducible results that are expressed as a 24-digit numerical code which allows for easy exchange of data [5-8]. This method can be applied to early mycobacterial cultures and more recently has been successfully applied directly to smear-positive specimens [5,9]. Previous studies have shown MIRU-VNTR typing to be useful in comparing strains (i) at national and international level, (ii) among household contacts, (iii) associated with drug resist - ance and (iv) to determine the evolutionary pathway of TB [5-6,10-16]. At European level, MIRU-VNTR typing has been adopted for the molecular surveillance of the international transmission of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB [7]. In November 2009, molecular genotyping in the form of 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing was introduced at the 82 www.eurosurveillance.orgIrish Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory (IMRL) which both cultures and receives isolates from microbiology laboratories around the country. To allow for rapid, high-throughput genotyping of M. tuberculosis , the commercial MIRU-VNTR typing kit (GenoScreen, Lille, France) was introduced in 2010 [5,7]. As 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing is considered the gold standard genotyp - ing method, all M. tuberculosis isolates identified at the IMRL are currently typed prospectively with this method, and it is envisaged that all M. tuberculosis isolates recovered since 2000 will be typed on a retro - spective basis. Here we report the first analysis of the structure of the M. tuberculosis population in Ireland for isolates recov - ered during 2010 and 2011 following the introduction of 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing to the diagnostic labo - ratory. It needs to be noted that at the time there was an under-representation of isolates from the southern region of Ireland. Methods MIRU-VNTR typing M. tuberculosis isolates (n=361) recovered in or referred to the IMRL over a two-year period (2010-11) were typed with the MIRU-VNTR typing kit (GenoScreen) [5]. Validation of the MIRU-VNTR performed using the MIRU-VNTR Calibration Kit (GenoScreen). PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis using a 3130 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems). Sizing of fragments and MIRU-VNTR assignation was performed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). Phylogenetic lineages were assigned to each isolate using the MIRU-VNTR plus online tool [17-18]. The 24-locus MIRU-VNTR panel comprised the follow - ing MIRU VNTR 42, VNTR 49, 31, VNTR 52, QUB 26, VNTR 53, and MIRU 39. The MIRU-VNTR profiles are reported as a series of 24 numbers that correspond to the number of alleles at each of the loci described above. Clusters of isolates were defined as two or more iso - lates with indistinguishable MIRU-VNTR patterns. The strain clustering rate was calculated as (n c-c)/n, where nc was the total number of strain-clustered cases, c was the number of clusters and n was the total number of isolates [5]. Epidemiological analysis Enhanced surveillance of TB was implemented in Ireland in 1998. Enhanced TB notification forms are completed by public health doctors, summarising all available clinical, microbiological, histological and epi - demiological information. These data are collated in the regional public health departments. Anonymised data are then submitted electronically to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) for the produc - tion of reports on a weekly, quarterly and annual basis. Since January 2011, cases of TB have been reported through the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting system (CIDR). CIDR is a web-based system developed to integrate case-based clinical and laboratory data in order to manage the surveillance and control of notifi - able infectious diseases in Ireland. Prior to using CIDR for TB surveillance, MIRU-VNTR typing results were not linked to case-based epidemiological data. In addition to recording sporadic case-based data, CIDR also facil - itates the reporting of clustered cases, according to Irish outbreak case definitions [2]. Clustered cases can be reported via a summary aggregate outbreak data module to which the relevant disaggregate case-based surveillance data can also be linked. Data analysis The TB enhanced surveillance data for 2011 (epidemio - logical and linked laboratory data) used in this publica - tion were extracted from CIDR on 17 April 2012 using Business Objects XI software and were analysed using Microsoft Excel. Data for 2011 were provisional at the time of extraction and subject to ongoing validation and revision. Results Results are presented in two separate sections. In the first part, genotyping results for isolates recovered in 2010-11 are presented. As epidemiological data link - ing was available from 2011 onwards, the second part of the results section (enhanced surveillance) refers to genotyping results linked to epidemiological data for 2011 isolates only. Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotyping, 2010-11 Some 361 M. tuberculosis isolates were recovered in or referred to the IMRL during 2010-11, represent - ing 63.6% of culture-positive cases identified through the national TB surveillance system in that period. Genotyping of M. tuberculosis isolates recovered dur - ing the study period yielded four global lineages (Table 1). The majority (63%) belonged to lineage 4 (Euro-American), while lineages 1 (Indo-Oceanic), 2 (East-Asian) and 3 (East-African-Indian) represented 12% each. Among (13%) were most prevalent (Table 1). Within lineage 4, 18 clusters were identified involving 63 TB cases (Table 2). The strain clustering rate varied between different sub-lineages, but was highest for the LAM sub-lineage (6.9%). While the mean cluster size was 3.5 TB cases, the largest cluster (involving 12 Irish-born cases, representing 19% of all clustered iso - lates) was identified within the LAM sub-lineage (Table 83 www.eurosurveillance.org2). Four other clusters within the LAM sub-lineage con - tained between 4.7% (3/63) and 12.7% (8/63) of clus the clustered cases of Haarlem, H37Rv and Haarlem/X, cluster sizes ranged from 3.2 to 9.5%, at 3.2% and from 3.2 to 4.7% of isolates, respectively. Only one cluster (3/63) contained exclusively foreign- born individuals, 12 clusters (47/63) involved Irish-born cases only, while five clusters (13/63) were mixed. In addition, one small cluster was observed among the isolates from lineage 2. The four MDR-TB cases identified during this period represented lineages 2 (Beijing) and 4 (Ural, H37Rv and LAM). None of the MDR-TB cases were clustered. Tuberculosis enhanced surveillance data for 2011 isolates (epidemiological and laboratory) In 2011, 432 TB cases were provisionally reported on CIDR, of which approximately 166 (38%) were typed. At the time of data extraction, 136 TB cases were updated to include MIRU typing results (representing 81.9% of 166 typed isolates). Of the 136 TB cases with a MIRU typing result, 34 were clustered in 11 clusters with dif - ferent MIRU types. Clusters ranged in size from eight to two TB cases. Of the 11 MIRU type clusters, five, com - prising 18 TB cases, were confirmed by public health departments as outbreaks meeting the Irish case definition. The Beijing sub-lineage was most prevalent (15.4%) and associated with a small cluster. Sub-lineages Haarlem, LAM, and H37Rv were most prevalent among lineage 4 strains, while lineage 1 and lineage 3 rep - resented 11.8% and 10.3% of typed isolates, respec - tively. Interestingly, isolates recovered from pulmonary specimens were mostly correlated with lineage 4 strains, while the majority of isolates recovered from extra-pulmonary specimens belonged to lineages 1 and 3 (Figure 1). In lineage 3, nine of 14 isolates were recov - ered from patients born in Pakistan, while the remain - ing five isolates were recovered from patients born in India (n=2), Kenya (n=1), Nepal (n=1) and Nigeria (n=1). Only one lineage 1 isolate was recovered from an Irish-born patient, while six were recovered from patients born in the Philippines. Other countries represented among lineage 1 isolates were Bangladesh, India, Mozambique, Pakistan, Somalia and Vietnam. The distribution of lineages among Irish-born and for - eign-born TB cases is shown in Figure 2. Of the 127 TB cases for whom MIRU-VNTR and country of birth were known, 51.5% were foreign-born and 41% were Irish-born. Lineages 1, 2 and 3 predominated among foreign-born TB cases, while a higher proportion of lineage 4 isolates were identified among Irish-born cases. Discussion This study has provided a snapshot of the genetic diver - sity of M. tuberculosis in Ireland. Due to the small num - bers of isolates in our study, statistical analysis would not be significant and was not performed. Although data on sub-lineages were analysed by age and sex, the resulting frequencies were too small to draw firm conclusions from. However, when age and sex analyses were further stratified by country of birth, these data were broadly similar to the age and sex profile of the Irish TB notification data. A large diverse group of isolates has been identified, suggesting a low degree of active transmission among TB patients. The distribution of genetic lineages is sim - ilar to other recent studies that used different typing techniques and in which lineage 4 (Euro-American) pre - dominated among circulating M. tuberculosis strains [12,19-21]. In previous work conducted in the south-west region of Ireland, lineage 4 predominated, and clustering of isolates was associated with Irish nation - als and lineage 4 isolates only [22]. In our study, the distribution of genetic lineages among extra-pulmo - nary specimens (where lineages 1 and 3 predominated) was similar to a recently published large-scale study conducted in the United States (US) investigating the relationship between genetic lineages and clinical sites of infection [23]. In the US study, the highest per - centage of isolates recovered from extra-pulmonary Table 1 Distribution of lineages among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, Ireland, 2010-11 (n=361) Global lineage Sub-lineageNo. of isolates% of isolates 1 Indo-Oceanic East-African-Indian 42 12 2 East-Asian Beijing 45 12 3 East-African-Indian Delhi/central-Asian 45 12 4 Euro-American Lineage 4 total 229 63 Latin American- Mediterranean52 Haarlem 47 H37Rv 44 Haarlem/X 29 Cameroon 13 S 6 TUR 8 X 5 Ghana 3 URAL 3 Uganda I & II 6 NEW-1 2 Othersa11 Total 361 100 a The category Others includes isolates for which the sub-lineages were not clearly defined84 www.eurosurveillance.orgspecimens was from lineages 1 (22.6%) and 3 (34.3%) [23]. However, due to the small numbers of exclusive extra-pulmonary specimens (n=30) and limited epide - miological data, statistical analysis of the relationship between lineage and clinical site of infection was not possible in our report. Molecular clustering of isolates in our study was more common among Irish-born individuals. These findings were similar to a previous Irish study conducted by Ojo et al. in the south-west region of Ireland, but unlike a recent study conducted in Switzerland [12,22]. We identified 18 clusters in lineage 4, and the mean clus - ter size was 3.5 TB cases. The largest cluster, involving 12 TB cases, belonged to the LAM lineage and spanned a period of 18 months. A second cluster identified in the LAM lineage differed by a single locus variant (SLV) at locus 2996. Similarly, in the Haarlem lineage, the two largest clusters differed by a SLV at locus 2996 also. MIRU 26 (or locus 2996) has yielded stable com - parable results in a large-scale study investigating 824 M. tuberculosis isolates conducted at the Institut Pasteur de Lille, France, in 2006 [5]. Molecular typing played a key role in identifying a dominant M. tubercu - losis strain (known as the Mercian strain) circulating in the West Midlands region in the United Kingdom (UK) over a five-year period, highlighting the importance of cluster analysis [14]. Prospective molecular typing can identify rapidly expanding clusters of M. tuberculosis before they spread further into the community. A sin - gle dominant MIRU-VNTR type was not observed in this study, however, this could be due to the study period being short. In contrast, prospective molecular typing of M. tuberculosis by RFLP, performed since 1993 in the Netherlands, has proven to be effective. DNA finger - printing data has been shown to be a powerful tool in defining epidemiological links and guiding TB control programmes in the Netherlands [24-25]. Another limitation of this study is that only one typing method was used to investigate the M. tuberculosis population structure in Ireland. Previous studies have shown that a combination of MIRU-VNTR typing and spoligotyping can differentiate more readily between M. tuberculosis strains [26-27]. However, in a previous Irish study using both spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing, MIRU-VNTR typing identified clusters among spoligotype groups, thus providing supporting evi - dence that MIRU-VNTR typing is a more discriminatory typing method [22]. The discriminatory power of the 24-locus MIRU-VNTR panel used in this study has shown to be similar to IS 6110 RFLP analysis [5]. However, the discriminatory power of 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing differs among genetic lineages, and the inclusion of Table 2 Clusters of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates within lineage 4 (Euro-American), Ireland, 2010-11 (n=172 isolates) Sub-lineageTotal no. of cases No. of clustered cases (%)No. of clustersStrain clustering rate (%)No. of isolates/ cluster (% cases)MIRU-VNTR Latin American-Mediterranean 52 30 (8.3) 5 6.93 (4.7) 124244332224126153332832 8 (12.7) 142244332224126153322622 12 (19) 142244332224126143322622 3 (4.7) 132244332224125153322222 4 (6.3) 132244332224126133322622 Haarlem 47 18 (5) 6 3.32 (3.2) 223225342334425143323332 6 (9.5) 223225342334425153323_32 2 (3.2) 123235332634425143423332 4 (6.3) 223225342334425143323_32 2 (3.2) 223235331532423153333632 2 (3.2) 223215332334425153323632 H37Rv 44 8 (2.2) 4 1.12 (3.2) 224243122234225153234422 2 (3.2) 224243122434225153335512 2 (3.2) 224213222534226153334522 2 (3.2) 224213322334226153335522 Haarlem/X 29 7 (1.9) 3 1.12 (3.2) 224234342334425154135832 3 (4.7) 243244332434425153343a32 2 (3.2) 243234332234425143331832 Total clustered lineage 4 cases 172 63 18 - - - a The numbers in this 24-digit profile correspond to the number of alleles at each of the following loci: MIRU VNTR VNTR 31, 53, MIRU 39. 86 www.eurosurveillance.orgadditional hypervariable loci may be required to dif - ferentiate among strains of lineages 2 (Beijing) and 3 (Delhi/central-Asian). For enhanced cluster or outbreak analysis, whole-genome sequencing has been shown to differentiate among strains with identical 24-locus MIRU-VNTR patterns [28-29]. The role of whole-genome sequencing in investigating community outbreaks in the UK was reported recently [29]. Walker et al. esti - mated that the rate of genetic changes was 0.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per genome per year. Furthermore, the maximum number of genetic changes over three years would be five SNPs and 10 SNPs over 10 years [29]. It has also been proposed that clustering of isolates increases over longer periods as transmis - sion chains are more efficiently analysed and reported [30]. But the M. tuberculosis genotype involved in the cluster must be considered as for example the Beijing lineage has increased ability to spread and cause dis - ease. While clustering was limited in our study, the study period was too short to draw clear conclusions. Although the reproducibility of MIRU-VNTR typing has been well documented, results from the first world - wide proficiency study on this method were surprising [7]. Intra- and inter- laboratory reproducibility varied depending on the typing methods employed in each laboratory. In our setting, when the commercial MIRU-VNTR typing kit was used to analyse the quality control panel, 100% concordance was achieved with the refer - ence data (30/30 tested strains) and 100% intra-labo - ratory reproducibility was achieved. These findings are important to consider when typing data is exchanged between laboratories. Although six of the 11 MIRU typing clusters identified during 2011 were not confirmed as outbreaks by pub - lic health departments, it is possible that the reason why four of these clusters did not meet the Irish TB out - break case definitions was the small number (n=2) of involved cases [2]. In summary, this study has provided the first insights into the structure of the M. tuberculosis population in Ireland. Although the incidence of TB has remained static in Ireland over the last decade, there has been mass immigration to this island nation. Not surpris - ingly, lineage 4 predominated among circulating strains of M. tuberculosis in the present study. But the degree of diversity among M. tuberculosis was unexpected. Future studies in the IMRL involving retrospective gen - otyping analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates collected since 2000 may provide an interesting epidemiologi - cal picture. Continued molecular surveillance is impor - tant as it has been suggested that the transmissibility profile of M. tuberculosis strains may be influenced by their genetic and evolutionary background. This under - standing of the dynamics of M. tuberculosis strains will provide novel insights into the M. tuberculosis popula - tion structure and how it relates to the epidemiology of TB in Europe and beyond.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20387 Article submitted 28 June 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Laboratory-based surveillance, one of the pillars of monitoring infectious disease trends, relies on data produced in clinical and/or public health laboratories. Currently, diagnostic laboratories worldwide submit strains or samples to a relatively small number of ref - erence laboratories for characterisation and typing. However, with the introduction of molecular diag - nostic methods and sequencing in most of the larger diagnostic and university hospital centres in high-income countries, the distinction between diagnostic and reference/public health laboratory functions has become less clear-cut. Given these developments, new ways of networking and data sharing are needed. Assuming that clinical and public health laboratories may be able to use the same data for their own pur - poses when sequence-based testing and typing are used, we explored ways to develop a collaborative approach and a jointly owned database (TYPENED) in the Netherlands. The rationale was that sequence data - whether produced to support clinical care or for surveillance -can be aggregated to meet both needs. Here we describe the development of the TYPENED approach and supporting infrastructure, and the implementation of a pilot laboratory network sharing enterovirus sequences and metadata. Introduction Laboratory-based surveillance is one of the pillars of monitoring infectious disease trends, which is based on data from clinical and/or public health laboratories. This type of surveillance is performed for a range of food- and waterborne, sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases, respiratory pathogens or zoonotic pathogens and provides important input for national and international disease surveillance, to evaluate the impact of control and prevention measures, and to detect clusters or relevant changes in pathogen pres - ence and/or behaviour [1-3]. One problem in the use of laboratory-based surveil - lance systems is that they require information that typically is collected at the clinical level and therefore is not focused on surveillance. For certain priority dis - eases, such as polio and measles, this issue has been solved by making the identification of a case notifi - able, in which case the laboratory or the clinician or both are required to provide structured information for surveillance to a national or international dedicated organisation. For non-notifiable diseases, however, the need for standardisation to ensure data compara - bility between laboratories may be at odds with the rapid developments in clinical microbiology labora - tories [4-6]. In the Netherlands, currently, diagnostic laboratories routinely submit strains or samples to reference laboratories for characterisation and typing. However, with the introduction of molecular diagnos - tic methods in most of the larger diagnostic centres, the distinction between diagnostic and reference labo - ratory functions has become less clear-cut. Multiplex real-time PCR and sequence-based detection and typ - ing techniques may be used for clinical diagnosis, to guide treatment (by, for example, resistance profiling, strain characterisation and typing), for hospital infec - tion control and quality management (for cluster detec - tion). The methods and analytical tools employed for these functions potentially overlap with what is needed for national and international or cross-border surveil - lance. The expected introduction of next generation 91 www.eurosurveillance.orgof a laboratory network, which also appoints a coor - dinator or curator. User types can be defined, coupled with tailored access rights. The two central entities are sample and sequence. A minimal dataset can be defined by the network, based on the questions addressed, coupled with a feasibility assessment. This dataset minimally comprises time and place, but can be complemented with additional epidemiological or clinical metadata specific to the targeted organism. Besides online data entry forms, the platform provides a bulk upload option using Microsoft Excel and FASTA formats. All sequences submitted to the database are auto - matically typed in a standardised way using a web- based typing tool [8]. Sequence data can be analysed by carrying out built-in similarity searches using the BLAST algorithm, and by generating pie charts, inci - dence plots, geographical maps and phylogenetic trees (neighbour-joining clustering method, with a two-parameter Kimura nucleotide-substitution model, with or without bootstrapping). The added value of a database like this - compared with the database of GenBank [9], in which laboratories all over the world share their sequences - is threefold. Firstly, the data are more comparable because of the agreed typing region and the standardised typing results and sec - ondly, the data are shared before laboratories have decided to make them publicly available, for example, through GenBank. The third important advantage is the linked, standardised set of epidemiological and clinical data with each sequence, which allows in-depth analy - sis. A description of the components and functions of the molecular platform is shown in Figure 2. Pilot study: enteroviruses On the basis of the inventory results, the seven labo - ratories agreed to start the pilot with enterovirus as a test pathogen. A minimum dataset was agreed, including age and sex of patient, type of sample from which the virus was detected, whether the patient was hospitalised, travel history (by country visited), clini - cal symptoms in broad categories (skin, neurological, respiratory, enteric). For each patient, at least one sequence of the major capsid protein VP1 gene has to be provided of the agreed genomic region (nucleotides 2,604-2,909 NC_001612, CVA16). In addition, samples that could not be typed as an enterovirus but were typed as poliovirus-like, were sent to the enterovirus section of the Center for Infectious Disease Control at RIVM, as part of the enterovirus surveillance pro - gramme in place, to document the absence of wild-type poliovirus circulation. Data sharing and confidentiality agreement Participants worked with a confidentiality agreement, consenting to the use of the data to provide surveil - lance overviews and alerts and to the right to publish the data, with proper acknowledgement, in case of public health emergencies. All participants can access and download the data, but they cannot be used with - out the consent of the data provider. Enterovirus diagnostics and sequencing Each laboratory used a laboratory-developed test, adapted from the protocol described by Nix et al. [10] (2006) for the detection of enteroviruses. One laboratory used an additional protocol described by McWilliam Leitch et al. [11] for cerebrospinal fluid sam - ples. All laboratories participated in an external profi - ciency testing programme organised through Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD), Glasgow, United Kingdom, an International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 17043-accredited organisation. Amplification of the 5' non-coding region of entero - virus was performed at the individual participating laboratory. Genotype assignment using a standardised sequence- based typing tool Upon entering of sequences into the database, an automated algorithm was run to assign the genotype. This tool has been validated against most currently known picornaviruses and has been shown to correlate highly with the serotype assignment [8]. Results Questionnaire information In addition to enterovirus, the seven participating labo - ratories indicated that they performed systematic gen - otyping for influenza virus (n=7), hepatitis B virus (n=6) and hepatitis C virus (n=5), primarily related to moni - toring of treatment. Some laboratories also typed pare - choviruses (n=5), rhinoviruses (n=3), hepatitis (HIV) (n=3), as well as hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus for specific research or clinical study-related questions. A need for a more structured collaboration between the laboratories, possibly including the operation of a joint reference database, was indicated by the majority of respondents regarding influenza virus, parechovirus, rhinovirus and hepatitis B virus. For the less commonly used typing approaches, a need for collaboration was expressed for hepatitis viruses A, C and E. Given the consensus that a type of collaborative network would meet a need, a pilot TYPENED database was set up for enteroviruses. Pilot enterovirus database As of 1 May 2012, a total of 651 human enterovirus (HEV) sequences were submitted to the TYPENED database, representing all enterovirus-positive clinical samples that were successfully sequenced at six of the collabo - rating laboratories from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011. Most of the sequences belonged to HEV-A (n=168; 25.8%) and B (n=466; only to HEV-C (n=6; 0.9%) and D (n=6; 0.9%). Following automatic typing of the sequences submitted 92 www.eurosurveillance.orgto the TYPENED database, it appeared that some of the viruses that were enterovirus positive in the molecular diagnostic assay appeared to be a rhinovirus A (n=5; 0.8%), most probably due to the cross-reactivity of the primers used for detection. In addition, three poliovi - rus sequences were identified within the HEV-C set: all three isolates were obtained from children from the for - mer Netherlands Antilles (Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten), where oral polio vaccines were used. The laboratories that submitted the sequences received samples from laboratories all over the Netherlands. Although the numbers per serotype were not always very large, some clusters of serotypes over time could be observed (detailed data not shown). For example, of the 48 CV-A9 sequences submitted, 43 were found in samples collected from May to August 2010 with a clear peak (n=38) in June and July. In addition, five of the six EV-D68 sequences were found in samples col - lected from August to November 2010; 46 of the 65 E-7 sequences were found in samples collected from May to August 2011 and 51 of the 69 E-25 sequences were found in samples collected from August to December 2011. Discussion We have described a data-sharing concept that com - bines the capacities of clinical and public health labo - ratories in the Netherlands in a database to which all laboratories have equal and full access. After initial discussions to align expectations and develop a code of conduct, all laboratories were able to share a first set of historical data within two months. One of the triggers for the development of this concept was the concern that current enterovirus surveillance which is based on cell culture isolation is no longer the pre - ferred method for enterovirus detection at hospital level and information obtained through other typing methods would not be captured centrally [12]. We managed to get consensus on the typing protocol and a data sharing agreement between the central public health laboratory (RIVM), large university labo - ratories and some large general hospitals that are geo - graphically dispersed, thus potentially enabling broad coverage of surveillance of viruses of common interest. Within the enterovirus pilot, all sequences generated in two years by six of the seven collaborating laborato - ries were shared. One pitfall of a consensus typing method may be that some viruses will be missed if they are not detected in the particular molecular test. This is of concern, given that the previously common practice of viral culture, which could serve as a safety net, is diminishing very rapidly. Most laboratories maintain these culture facili - ties only to grow control material for molecular assays. Since RNA viruses diverge rapidly, there is a need to get updated full-length sequences, not only for epide - miological reasons but also to keep diagnostic assays based on molecular testing up to date. At present, the availability of whole genome sequences is limited, but with next generation sequencing techniques rapidly coming within reach of academic and even clinical lab - oratories, this situation will change quickly. The same system is currently being set up for a num - ber of other viruses for which collaboration was valued according to the questionnaire - with parechovirus, norovirus and hepatitis E virus on the priority list [13-15]. Sequence-based characterisation is becoming more common within the larger diagnostic centres: the availability of sequence-based information will assist both the clinicians and diagnostic laboratories as well as the public health laboratories. The concept of TYPENED in the Netherlands has been shown to be an effective means of close collaboration and the participating laboratories are willing to extend this collaboration to other targets. Furthermore, by using sequencing technologies, a more in-depth analy - sis of circulating strains can be carried out, as individ - ual sequences can be analysed, instead of serotypes. Sequences have a much higher discriminatory power, as most sequences within one serotype will be differ - ent from each other, thus facilitating, for example, the tracing of transmission patterns. Sequence techniques are particularly valuable for viruses that are difficult to grow. In an economic climate with shrinking budgets, it may prove difficult for facilities to perform sequencing for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, although it is expected that large centres will continue to per - form routine sequencing. The TYPENED model seeks to maximise the use of data generated both in clinical and public health laboratories, for clinical care and for sur - veillance purposes. The harmonisation of typing proto - cols and sharing of data with a more extensive group of laboratories, or even cross-border centres, will be a next step.93 www.eurosurveillance.orgReferences 1.

Euro Surveill. 2013;18(3):pii=20355. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20355 Article submitted on 07 May 2012 / published on 17 January 2013 Following a first clinical case of infection by Diphyllobothrium dendriticum in Switzerland in 2006, we report a second case in the country. The species was identified by molecular methods. In the Swiss, French and Italian subalpine regions, human diphyllo - bothriasis has seen a comeback since the late 1980's, and Diphyllobothrium latum is usually considered the causative agent of the disease. In addition, several locally acquired and imported clinical infections due to allochthonous Diphyllobothrium species have been documented in the last years. Due to the colonisation potential of these parasites and their probably under - estimated presence in the human population, there is a need for discriminating them at the medical labo - ratory level. Because the morphological characters are very similar among the different taxa, a correct identification requires the use of molecular methods. Molecular identification would improve diagnosis and help monitor the distribution of Diphyllobothrium spe- cies in Europe. Introduction Diphyllobothriasis is due to tapeworms of the genus Diphyllobothrium and is acquired through the con - sumption of raw or poorly cooked freshwater fish. In distinct stages of their life cycle, Diphyllobothrium spp. occupy different host species. The eggs present in the water are ingested by small crustaceans, such as cope - pods, constituting the first intermediate hosts in which they develop to a larval stage. As crustaceans are pre - dated by fish, fish become the second intermediate hosts where Diphyllobothrium larvae further develop. The definite hosts are fish eating mammals (including humans) or birds, where Diphyllobothrium matures into an adult stage. Human diphyllobothriasis is often a mild illness: about half of the patients are asymptomatic, while the oth - ers mostly suffer from minor discomforts, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and digestive troubles. Rare cases of megaloblastic anaemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency have been reported in the litera - ture [1]. Globally, the incidence of human diphyllobothria - sis has decreased in the last 20 years, particularly in northern and eastern Europe [2]. Nevertheless, in some Swiss, French and Italian subalpine regions the disease has seen a comeback, as shown by the more than 530 cases reported since 1987 from around lakes Leman (Geneva), Morat, Bienne, Maggiore, Lario (Como), latum is considered the causative agent of diphyllobothriasis. However, infections due to allochthonous species ( D. nihonkaiense, D. den - driticum ) have been recently documented [3-7]. A first clinical case due to D. dendriticum was diagnosed in 2006 in Switzerland, raising the question of potential transmission to susceptible intermediate hosts present in the local environment [4]. In this report, we describe a second case of symptomatic infection by D. dendriti - cum in Switzerland. Confirmation of the species was done by molecular identification. A four year-old boy expelled tapeworm segments in stool, 12 days after returning from a 15-day holiday travel in Singapore and Bali in August 2010. He had been suffering from abdominal pains (cramps) and loose stools since his return to Switzerland. Standard laboratory procedures held in the clinical laboratory (Dianalabs) led to the identification of Diphyllobothrium spp., based upon the presence of typical operculated eggs in segments. However, because of the unusual shape of a tapeworm proglottid (longer than wide as if stretched, with an excentred uterus) and the possible Asian origin of infection, the specimen was preserved in 70\u00b0 ethanol and sent to the Institute of Parasitology in Bern and to the Cantonal Institute of Microbiology in Bellinzona, where it was identified as D. dendriticum by molecular methods.95 www.eurosurveillance.orgMebendazole was first administered to the patient, with no curative effect, as confirmed by the persist - ing presence of eggs in stool after three weeks. The patient was then re-medicated with praziquantel and recovered promptly. No parasites were found upon stool testing six weeks after praziquantel therapy. The patient's family did not present with symptoms and underwent no further investigation, except for the seven year-old patient's sister who was checked for intestinal parasites but found negative. Methods The faecal specimen was processed by standard sedi - mentation technique [8] to concentrate putatively pre - sent Diphyllobothrium eggs and subsequently assess these by light microscopy. A segment of proglottids of approximately 5 cm length was processed for staining with lacto-acetic carmine according to Rukhadze and Blajin [9]. Genomic DNA from about 50 mg of proglottid tissue was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was per - formed using the Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen) with primers targeting a region of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (5.8S rRNA) comprising internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 [10], the 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) [11] [3,12] sequences. The amplification of all targets was carried out under the following conditions: 5 min at 94 \u00b0C, 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 40 s at 45 \u00b0C, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. Amplicons were visualised by electropho - resis agarose gel ethidium bro - mide, and purified through Sephadex G-50 columns (GE Healthcare). DNA was quantified with a ND-100 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.). Sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the provider's recommenda - tions. Samples were purified by osmosis with 0.025 m nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) in tris ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (TE) buffer pH 8 for two hours. Eight l of purified solution were placed in 0.5 ml Genetic Analyzer Sample Tubes with 12 l Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems). Samples were then loaded in an automated sequencing system (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer; Perkin Elmer). Sequence electropherograms were corrected by using the software EditSeq (DNASTAR Inc.). Their identity was first checked by basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [13]. Sequence fragments of 657 and 375 nucleotides in length, derived from the PCRs targeting the ITS1-5.8SrRNA and cox1 genes were then respec - tively compared representative or cox1 multiple alignments using ClustalW [14] with the software Molecular Evolutionary Genetics [15]. Phylogenetic were subsequently inferred from the alignments. Results Microscopical analyses of the coprological sediment revealed the presence of oval-shape unembryonated eggs (mean x 62.5-70 \u00b5m), characterised by the presence of a hardly vis - ible operculum and a small knob at the abopercular end (Figure 1). Microscopical analyses of the stained proglottids revealed the presence of only one set of reproduc - tive organs per proglottid (Figure 2). The central uter - ine structure showed several rosette-shaped loops. Morphological criteria matched to those described Figure 1 Diphyllobothrium dendriticum eggs recovered from a patient stool, Switzerland, 2010 White arrow: operculum; grey arrow: knob.

The nucleotide sequences of the ITS1-5.8S rRNA, 18S rRNA and cox1 derived from the Diphyllobothrium affecting the patient were deposited in public data - bases and are available in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), GenBank and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDJB) accession num - bers HQ682065, HQ682066 and HQ682067. Due to technical problems, the sequence of ITS2 was not fully obtained and therefore not used in the analysis.The results of BLAST search showed that all the sequenced targets respectively reached 99% identity (highest scores) at the nucleotide level with D. den - driticum homologous reference sequences rRNA sequence also showed 99% identity the sample of ITS1-5.8S rRNA and cox1 regions in the phylogenetic trees confirmed Diphyllobothrium spp.affecting the patient as D. dendriticum (Nitsch, 1824) (Figures 3 and 4). The phy - logenetic tree built on the basis of 18S rRNA sequences is not shown, because this target is not useful for the discrimination of D. dendriticum from other species [2]. Discussion At the time of tapeworm evacuation, the patient was known to have had a meal in a Japanese restaurant in Singapore (on day 4 of his journey) where the family had consumed various dishes (fish, chicken). According to the recollection of the family members, the meal did not contain raw fish. Retrospective investigations revealed that the patient regularly consumed fish, e.g. smoked salmon with pasta at home. This salmon was always bought in the same department store in France and was of the same brand. According to the product information, it belonged to the species Salmo salar, was farmed in Norway, smoked in France and guaran - teed 'never frozen'. The homemade sauce was made by dropping slices of smoked salmon into boiling cream Figure 2 Diphyllobothrium dendriticum segment recovered from a patient stool, Switzerland, 2010 A.

According to his mother, the patient enjoyed picking pieces of uncooked fish during the preparation of the meal. Short before travelling to south-east Asia, the patient consumed poorly cooked perch fillets ( Perca fluviatilis ) fished in the Leman lake in a restaurant near home. He also ate sushi in Switzerland one week before tapeworm segments were noticed. Aquatic birds (especially Laridae) are usually the defin - itive hosts of D. dendriticum , while humans are only occasionally infected. According to literature, the incu - bation period of D. dendriticum in herring gulls ( Larus argentatus ) lasts from five to 20 days [17]. In humans, Diphyllobothrium plerocercoids generally develop into mature adults in two to six weeks [2]. Based on these observations, the source of the patient's infection might be either salmon from Norway, unknown fish from Asia or perch from Switzerland. However, because the presence of D. dendriticum in perch has not been documented so far, it is unlikely that the perch meal was the source of infection. The sushi meal in Switzerland can be excluded because the symptoms were already present at that time. In the last two decades, diphyllobothriasis has shown a recrudescence in a number of European countries, especially in the subalpine lakes region [2]. The use of molecular methods also showed the presence of allochthonous D. nihonkaiense and D. dendriticum in France, Switzerland, Finland and the Czech Republic (Table). Except for two cases of D. dendriticum diag - nosed in Switzerland [4] and the Czech Republic [18] that were probably acquired abroad (Norway, Alaska or Canada), most of the documented infections were locally acquired, attributed to imported salmons. Susceptible intermediate hosts for D. dendriticum such as copepods are known to be present in Switzerland. This would theoretically allow the introduction and the autoch - tonous transmission of the parasite. This colonisation potential emphasises the need for correct identifica - tion of Diphyllobothrium species involved in clinical cases of infection. Interestingly, in the two Swiss cases due to D. den - driticum , the molecular investigation was undertaken because of the unusual shape of some segments. The transmission of Diphyllobothrium plerocercoids may be prevented by freezing fish at -20 \u00b0C for one to seven days, depending on its thickness. The Swiss law [22] provides that it is forbidden to sell any kind of fresh fish products (both local and imported) intended to be consumed raw or semi-raw, unless they have been stored at a temperature not higher than -20 \u00b0C for a least 24 hours. However, it has been demonstrated that this rule is not always followed properly [23], and of course there is no control of food bought abroad by individuals for personal use. Therefore cooking at 55 \u00b0C or more, for at least 5 min, remains the most reli - able way to prevent transmission of parasitic worms possibly present in fresh fish [2]. Conclusion A correct diagnosis has become crucial to evaluate the distribution of human-infecting Diphyllobothrium species, as well as their fish hosts, and to prevent the spread of allochthonous parasites in aquatic envi - ronments. Due to the difficulties in discriminating the different Diphyllobothrium taxa by morphological char - acters, molecular analysis has proven to be fundamen - tal to identify these helminths at the species level. A cheap and rapid molecular test based on multiplex PCR with partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene, without the need of sequencing, was recently developed for the differential identification of the most common species infecting humans [24]. In case of atyp - ical specimens of proglottids and eggs and/or speci - mens derived from patients who have been abroad, this test could be used to verify the parasite's identity. Improving the diagnosis of Diphyllobothrium parasites would help to monitor the distribution of species in Europe and trace the source of infections, an important goal at a time when eating habits are changing, fish markets are globalising and climate is changing [25].Figure 4 Neighbour-joining tree based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 sequences, to determine the Diphyllobothrium species affecting a patient, Switzerland, 2010 The tree is based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) sequence fragments of 375 bp.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20383 Article submitted on 30 June 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 The persistence and transmission of infectious disease is one of the most enduring and daunting concerns in healthcare. Over the years, epidemiological analysis especially of bacterial etiological agents has under - gone a remarkable evolutionary metamorphosis. While initially relying on purely phenotypic characterisation, advances in molecular biology have found transla - tional application in a number of approaches to strain typing which commonly centre either on 'epityping' (molecular epidemiology) to characterise outbreaks, perform surveillance, and trace evolutionary path - ways, or 'pathotyping' to compare strains based on the presence or absence of specific virulence or resist - ance genes. A perspective overview of strain typing is presented here considering the issues surrounding analyses which are employed in the localised clinical setting as well as at a more regional/national public health level. The discussion especially considers the shortcomings inherent in epidemiological analysis: less than full isolate characterisation by the typing method and limitations imposed by the available data, context, and time constraints of the epidemiological investigation (i.e. the available epidemiological win - dow). However, the promises outweigh the pitfalls as one considers the potential for advances in genomic characterisation and information technology to pro - vide an unprecedented aggregate of epidemiological information and analysis. Introduction Since the time of Semmelweis and Koch's Postulates, medical science has recognised the cause-and-effect relationship between the transmission of etiological agents and the persistence and spread of infectious disease. In this context, routine clinical and infection control interests commonly centre on the detection of multifocal patient infection or dissemination within a defined patient population (e.g. outbreak identifica - tion, control, or other rather short-term epidemiological issues). Conversely, public health concerns include local, regional, national, and international emergence and spread of pathogens, global microbiological and molecular surveillance, as well as longer term evolu - tionary interrelationships. Classical epidemiology uses the three parameters (time, place, person) to find epi - demiological links. However, in both healthcare and community-associated infections today, those three parameters do not necessarily provide the desired resolution to identify an outbreak event or the causing pathogen. Clinical microbiology provides species-level isolate identification and molecular analysis provides the strain type or subtype fingerprint. Bringing these five parameters together provides the greatest hope of associating outbreaks of infectious disease with cer - tain types of the same bacterial species. This perspec - tive overview considers the epidemiological analysis of infectious diseases in both the clinical and public health setting, focusing on bacterial etiologies to illus - trate issues associated with moving molecular strain typing from theory to practical application. Regardless of the setting, the interrelationships that strain typing seeks to clarify are generally in the context of epityp - ing (i.e. transmission investigation (e.g. outbreak)) or pathotyping to compare strains based on the presence or absence of specific virulence genes. The former is emphasised here and discussed in the context of two principal challenges independent of the methods employed: isolate characterisation and the available data, context, and time constraints of the epidemio - logical investigation (i.e. the available epidemiological window). The challenge of isolate characterisation In both the clinical and public health setting, the assessment of potential interrelationships between isolates is based on a comparison of specific character - istics which ideally will identify (i.e. fingerprint) trans - mitted strains as the same type while not overlooking 101 www.eurosurveillance.orgepidemiologically relevant variants (subtypes) or mis - takenly including unrelated isolates (i.e. issues of sen - sitivity and specificity). Isolate characterisation has been historically based on phenotypic assessment which is most certainly still of value (e.g. antibiograms, serotyping). However, recognition of the bacterial chro - mosome as the fundamental molecule of cellular iden - tity has firmly established the importance of molecular (genomic) epidemiological evaluation. Thus, molecular approaches to isolate characterisation are considered here. In general, historical review reveals a consist - ent 'translational' trend of genotypic methods moving from the basic science laboratory to clinical applica - tion. These approaches to molecular epidemiology are reviewed more completely elsewhere [1,2] and are only summarised here to note the challenges faced in terms of providing definitive isolate characterisation for epi - demiological purposes. Simply stated, when it comes to epidemiological sen - sitivity and specificity the key methodological issues are: (i) the degree to which the targets/markers being analysed provide epidemiologically relevant infor - mation and (ii) the precision with which the queried characteristic(s) are identified and analysed. The for - mer relates to epidemiological validation which has been considered elsewhere [3] and is beyond the scope of this discussion. However, by way of summary it is important to note that, regardless of analytical pre - cision, other than whole genome sequencing (WGS) all methods strive to assess isolate interrelatedness based on a subset of targets that represent a genomi - cally incomplete, but epidemiologically relevant, dataset. Thus, for these approaches, additional data is more informative than less (e.g. see [4]). In terms of precise data output, while newer methods employ instrumentation (e.g. capillary electrophoresis using an automated DNA sequencer [5]), a significant number of currently used protocols rely on visual inspection of data output generated by agarose gel electropho - resis (Table). While such analysis can be accurate for protocols involving the presence or absence of end point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, vis - ual assessment of fragment-size comparisons (e.g. by agarose gel electrophoresis) can be problematic. For example, digestion of total cellular DNA by common restriction enzymes (restriction endonuclease analysis (REA)) can generate greater than 600 fragments from a typical 2 to 3 Mb bacterial chromosome. In addition, there is an element of imprecision in the visual compar - ison of DNA banding patterns in electrophoresis gels since DNA fragments differing by \u00b110% may be seen as identical [6]. This could amount to a 70 kb discrepancy, for example, in a pulsed-field gel with bands ca. 700 kb in size. As noted earlier, the chromosome is the most fun - damental molecule of identity in the cell. Thus, it is the sequence-based methods that ultimately hold the greatest promise for accurately assessing epide - miological interrelationships in problem pathogens. Reviewed elsewhere [2,7] these methods can be found in three general iterations: single locus sequence typ - ing (SLST), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and WGS (Table). Of these, the first two have found broad epidemiological application although, as noted above for other methods, both represent a genomically incomplete dataset, while WGS holds clear promise for providing total chromosomal analysis. While WGS was impossible with older dideoxy/chain termination sequencing technology [8], newer (i.e. next genera - tion sequencing, NGS) methods have made this goal a reality. The technology behind NGS is discussed in detail elsewhere [7,9], however, from a strain typing Table Characteristics of methods commonly used for molecular epidemiology Data generation Chromosomal target(s) Data output Method examples Restriction enzymes Common restriction sites DNA fragments visualised after agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) Restriction enzymes Common restriction sites Ordered sequence scaffolds identified via instrument softwareOptical mapping Restriction enzymes Rare restriction sites DNA fragments visualised after AGE Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Repetitive element or variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequencesAmplified DNA fragments either visualised PCR PCR ribotyping DNA probes Multiple Hybridisation signal either identified visually or via instrument softwareMicroarray DNA sequencing Single or multiple genes DNA sequence obtained via instrument software Staphylococcus aureus protein A gene (spa) typing; multilocus sequence typing (MLST) DNA sequencing Whole genome DNA sequence obtained via instrument software Whole genome sequencing (WGS); next generation sequencing (NGS) A full description of methods is reported elsewhere [1,2].103 www.eurosurveillance.orgThe 'typing Esperanto' It is of utmost importance, that typing methods pro - duce data that can be compared not only within the same laboratory or clinical setting, but also between different facilities. Therefore, the 'typing Esperanto' or language should produce data that are clear, repro - ducible, and include strain nomenclature which allows for the independent identification of specific types. However, it is important to note that the probability of an outbreak due to a certain strain type depends on its frequency in the associated environment (e.g. both within and outside of the healthcare setting, the com - munity). The less frequent a strain type is, the more probable it becomes that multiple isolates (a cluster) of a certain strain type represent a true outbreak. Thus, epidemiological analysis must recognise the nuances associated with disease transmission such as distin - guishing outbreaks from pseudo-outbreaks [14]. The latter occur frequently in environments associated with an endemic prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microor - ganisms. For example, in a clinical setting, patients on the same hospital ward may carry similar but distinct problem pathogens which could superficially mimic an outbreak. Useful typing should properly identify such a pseudo-outbreak thus helping to avoid inappropri - ate escalation of 'outbreak' management. This kind of 'de-compromising' and 'de-escalating'is one of the major reasons why local hospitals and their laborato - ries perform strain typing for outbreak analysis. Thus, whether in a clinical or public health setting, the dis - criminatory or resolving power of a given epidemio - logical analysis is not solely dependent on a method or a method-pathogen combination but may be also be influenced by the pathogens' diversity (i.e. the more or less frequent appearance/epidemicity or endemicity of a specific type). Choosing the 'best' method for typing Whether considering strain typing from the clinical or public health perspective, the logical question is: what is the best method procedurally to use? However, there are a number of reasons why a 'one size fits all' answer to this question is impractical. Considering first the clinical environment, as noted earlier, strain typing is commonly of value in assess - ing therapeutic concerns such as multisite infection or emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the indi - vidual patient, and transmission of problem pathogens within a limited patient population (e.g. a healthcare or family unit). In this context the key issues include: (i) having the required technical expertise, (ii) poten - tial for automation/routine applicability, (iii) cost, (iv) required time-to-answer, (v) equipment maintenance and footprint size, (vi) intuitive data output and objec - tive, standardisable, or automated interpretation, (vii) relevance of the typing result for further investigations (e.g. screening of staff) or for reporting to public health authorities. It is logical to aspire to the most recently published cutting-edge method. However, the newest iteration of the most sophisticated and advanced technology is of little value if one does not have physical room for it, cannot afford it, properly operate it, or readily achieve clinically or epidemiologically relevant outcomes from the data generated. While one would never recommend gravitating to the lowest technological denominator for strain typing, to a large extent the 'best' method in a given clinical environment depends on the avail - able resources addressing the issues noted above. In this context, as stated earlier, it is important to rec - ognise that, regardless of sophistication, molecular strain typing commonly operates from an incomplete data set since all relevant clinical isolates may not be available and all isolate characteristics may not have been analysed, although the latter issue will be less of a concern in the future as WGS becomes more refined and widespread. In addition, communication between appropriate clinical interests (e.g. physician, labora - tory, nursing, infection control) is vital to putting the 'incomplete'typing data into the fullest context for a meaningful outcome in terms of infection prevention and control. Taken together, in addition to routine and real time strain typing, key elements for successful strain typing in the clinical setting most certainly include [3,15]: (i) initiation of strain typing by the hospital epidemiolo - gist in consultation with infection control, infectious disease, and microbiology personnel, (ii) targeting of strain typing to investigate specific infectious dis - ease issues such as an unusual increase in the rate of isolation of a pathogen, a cluster of infections in a particular healthcare unit, and multiple isolates with unusual (e.g. antibiotic susceptibility) characteristics, (iii) understanding that strain typing in the absence of epidemiological context and follow-up is an ineffi - cient use of laboratory resources. Strain typing should supplement, not replace, careful epidemiological investigation. To a large extent, the issues affecting approaches to strain typing for public health purposes are similar to those previously noted for local clinical efforts. However, there are important differences. The con - cerns of public health, while clinical in nature, are much broader in scope especially focusing on the transmission of problem pathogens on a local, regional, national, and international scale. Therefore, while financial and technical resources are gener - ally more abundant at the regional/national level, the complexity of the necessary outcomes is greater as well. Effective communication to insure that the typing method's results are comparable between all labora - tories involved is at the heart of a proper large-scale understanding of infectious disease occurrence and transmission. Everything from choice of typing method to data output and interpretation revolves around this issue. Thus, from a methodological standpoint the strain typing approach should: (i) be as standardised 104 www.eurosurveillance.orgas possible to be performed with similar efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in different participating laboratories, (ii) generate output that can be efficiently databased and shared, with interpretative criteria as objective as possible and a common terminology for strain type and subtype designations. In this regard, sequence-based approaches hold the greatest promise. For example, SLST of the staphylococ - cal protein A gene (spa-typing) is effectively used in the epidemiological monitoring of specific Staphylococcus aureus strains (i.e. SeqNet; www.seqnet.org) with 540 laboratories from 51 countries submitting strains from 90 countries worldwide using the Ridom spa server as a common platform [16]. As noted earlier, approaches to WGS are rapidly being developed and refined with the potential to ultimately provide strain typing data rang - ing from key gene subsets [17] to total chromosomal comparison [18]. However, the success of the Pulse-Net System, designed by the United States Centers for Disease Control to investigate food-borne outbreaks [19], as well as refinements in VNTR-based analysis of pathogens such as meticillin-resistant S. aureus [5,20], illustrate that older molecular typing approaches also have potential for effective public health application. Clinical and public health strain typing in perspective Whether performed in a local clinical or more regional/ national public health setting, the effective use of strain typing requires an understanding of both the pitfalls and the promises of the process. While the pitfalls can certainly be methodological, perhaps the most fundamental caveat, as noted above, is that strain typing is not a standalone method. Therefore, more information and communication is better than less. The scenario is not unlike an unfolding mystery story where one needs as much evidence as possible to figure out who 'did it.' For both local and larger-scale regional settings, the promise is a better understand - ing of the dynamics of infectious disease transmission with the hope of effective intervention (prevention, infection control, and treatment). Remarkable pos - sibilities are on the horizon when one considers advances in genomic characterisation and the power of the Internet to facilitate the linking of strain typing analysis and databasing to other previously disparate data such as antimicrobial resistance (e.g. European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net); www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/activities/surveillance/EARS-Net/Pages/index.aspx) and geographic informa - tion systems (GIS) as elegantly shown by the European Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory (SRL) working group (www.spatialepidemiology.net/srl-maps)[21] EpiScanGIS (www.episcangis.org), Global Network for Geospatial Health (GnosisGIS) (www.gnosisgis.org), and the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Public Health Mapping GIS effort (www.who.int/health_map - ping/en). Most recently, during the Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany, open-source genomic analysis, available hardware/software resources and international expertise contributed tremendously to the rapid understanding of the pathogens' evolution, dissemination, and pathology [22]. Thus, for the future, the promises outweigh the pitfalls as molecular strain typing seeks to address enduring infectious disease issues with important morbidity, mortality, economic, and general quality of life implications.105 www.eurosurveillance.orgReferences 1.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20384 Article submitted on 20 June 2012 / published on 24 January 2013 Current thinking on the development of molecular microbial characterisation techniques in public health focuses mainly on operational issues that need to be resolved before incorporation into daily practice can take place. Notwithstanding the importance of these operational challenges, it is also essential to formulate conditions under which such microbial characterisa - tion methods can be used from an ethical perspective. The potential ability of molecular techniques to show relational patterns between individuals with more cer - tainty brings a new sense of urgency to already dif - ficult ethical issues associated with privacy, consent and a moral obligation to avoid spreading a disease. It is therefore important that professionals reflect on the ethical implications of using these techniques in outbreak management, in order to be able to formu - late the conditions under which they may be applied in public health practice. Introduction Recent advances in molecular microbial characterisa - tion open up new scientific opportunities for a better understanding of not only the pathogenicity, evolution and spread of human pathogens, but also the epidemi - ology of the diseases they cause. Such progress has promising prospects for infectious disease control, particularly for real-time source and contact tracing in outbreak management [1]. Current thinking on the development of molecular microbiology characterisa - tion techniques in public health focuses predominantly on the operational issues that need to be resolved [1]. The recommendations of the November 2011 expert consultation Breakthroughs in molecular epidemiology of human pathogens - how to translate breakthroughs into public health practice , organised by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), clearly outline the scientific hurdles that need to be overcome in order for public health to benefit from the recent scientific and technological advances in the rapidly evolving next generation sequencing tech - nologies [1]. Despite the importance of these opera - tional challenges, it is also essential to address the ethical difficulties associated with the use of microbial characterisation techniques in public health. The need for ethical guidance concerning the use of molecular typing methods is not new. Ethical challenges stem - ming from the introduction of molecular genomics have often been addressed in the context of population-level genomics and biobanking; such issues include those related to persons' autonomy and the patient-healthcare professional relationship. The use of these techniques in infectious disease control now raises similar ethical issues, in which individual interests and individual needs must be weighed against those of the public at large [2]. Due to recent scientific and techno - logical advances in molecular microbial characterisa - tion, the need for ethical guidance has now gained a new sense of urgency [3]. Although microbial characterisation techniques have primarily (and successfully) been used to benefit the general public's health, the results can also be used for other purposes, notably in support of legal or moral claims about responsibility and liability. For example, in 2007, in the Netherlands, genetic sequence analysis of HIV strains was used in a criminal case, in which the plaintiffs, who were recently infected with HIV, accused the defendants of deliberately administering them a subcutaneous injection of HIV-positive blood. The com - parison of the genetic sequence analysis of the HIV strains of both parties was used as legal evidence [4]. Another example is a listeriosis outbreak linked to a food facility near Toronto, Canada, in 2008 [2]. Public health officials initially responded to the outbreak using traditional contact tracing and outbreak inves - tigation. The food facility issued a voluntary recall of cold meat products before a confirmed linkage was available. Typing was used retrospectively to reduce uncertainty about the link between the 100 confirmed cases (23 deaths) and exposure to contaminated food from the facility. The resulting class-action law - suits filed in four Canadian provinces were settled in December 2008 for US$ 27 million. 107 www.eurosurveillance.orgIn these examples, the approach was successful from a medical perspective; however, from an ethical per - spective, information that was initially collected for the purpose of public health was then also used in a legal context. Thus the results of genetic sequencing of infectious agents for purposes that go beyond pro - tection of public health can yield important societal benefits, but can also facilitate legal claims (and hence economic risk) for individual persons or companies. And even in cases where individual persons or com - panies could do little to prevent an outbreak or avoid being a causal factor in transmitting disease, public perception of responsibility for infection may easily lead to stigmatisation and thus negatively affect the lives of the persons involved. In this context, we highlight the most dominant ethi - cal issues in regard to the use of molecular techniques. This is to facilitate further ethical reflection by pub - lic health professionals regarding the use of molecu - lar techniques. We use the term to refer to a range of molecular microbial characterisation techniques that enable the linking of pathogens and that are now becoming increasingly available for real-time source and contact tracing. Relational patterns between pathogens and people: a sense of urgency to the existing ethical debate The ethical challenges associated with molecular tech - niques are mostly linked to their ability to give more precise information on the relational patterns between different microbes found in an outbreak [5-7]. Although the results of such techniques must be understood in the context of traditional epidemiological information - and even then, the most probable transmission route is rarely the only one possible - molecular techniques can allow more certainty on the relational patterns between microbes found in an outbreak. This inference about the directionality of transmission, may however, also specify the relational patterns between the people hosting them. This may be perceived by the public as an answer to the 'who infected whom?' question in an outbreak. While the ethical issues related to this ques - tion are not new, molecular techniques may heighten the level of certainty regarding such patterns and in this way introduce a sense of urgency to the ethical debate [8,9]. Moral obligation to avoid spreading a disease That advanced sequencing technologies show poten - tial relational patterns between people may fuel pub - lic discussions about who is responsible for infection or outbreaks. This is a complex issue with no simple conclusions; however, it is tempting to jump from infor - mation about 'who infected whom' to judgments about responsibility for infection. Attribution of responsibil - ity to individuals for outbreaks of infectious diseases, however, is ethically problematic, even with the most sophisticated microbial molecular typing techniques. This is because although molecular microbial typing methods can help to elucidate potential transmission pathways, additional conditions are required before moral responsibility for the spread of infection can be attributed to individuals. More advanced molecular technology (in combination with epidemiological infor - mation) may be able to visualise certain transmission patterns in an outbreak, but this does not necessarily lead to factual conclusions on the cause of disease. Transmission of a microbe, for instance, may lead to col - onisation, but colonisation may not necessarily lead to infection or subsequent disease. But even if we assume that transmission leads to disease, this does not make the source or actor morally responsible. The conditions for attributing moral responsibility for spreading a dis - ease include numerous factors that need to be taken into account, for instance, knowledge of the risk, of the transmission pathways and ways to avoid infection, as well as competence to take adequate precautions [10]. Moreover, whether one can rightfully attribute moral responsibility will depend on whether it is reasonable to expect people to take precautions against infecting others and whether the infected persons could have easily protected themselves. Hence, judgments about moral responsibility are complex: even though molecu - lar typing technologies may show relatively clear trans - mission pathways, this should not be considered as a sufficient basis for judgments about responsibility for infection. This is not to say that the laws of some countries may address this moral obligation to avoid spreading a disease and have specified what action is legally prohibited, required or permissible, attaching legal consequences for those who fail to act in line with such dictates. Ownership of pathogens In addition to this concept of a moral responsibility for infection, molecular techniques also place the concept of privacy in a new perspective. The question of pri - vacy is associated in a way with the question of own - ership. In bioethics, there already is a debate on who owns a biological specimen isolated from an individual at a certain moment in time [11], regarding whether a biological specimen (such as tissue, blood or stool) and the pathogen found in this specimen, in some way 'belong' to the individual they came from. In outbreak management, this question is further complicated by the fact that a number of pathogens are transmissable from person to person, which means that they may be seen as 'owned' by various persons over time. Informed consent Irrespective of the outcome of this ownership debate, privacy from a perspective of ethical and legal issues surrounding informed consent also need to be addressed when molecular techniques are used in outbreak management. There are various ethical and legal theories or accounts given of what informed con - sent exactly means and how it should be conducted in practice. From an ethical perspective, informed con - sent is concerned with the consent being 'informed', 108 www.eurosurveillance.org'voluntary', and 'decisionally-capacitated', meaning that all information needs to be disclosed to a com - petent ('capacitated') patient, who understands all that has been disclosed, and that this patient volun - tarily consents to treatment (or to a research subject when it comes to participation in research) [12]. This raises important questions about how these informed consent requirements could be conceptualised when using molecular techniques in outbreak management. One such question pertains to formulating information disclosure requirements: what (type and how much) information ought to be disclosed and comprehended in order for someone to be able to legitimately consent to any type of intervention or procedure proposed by a public health official? Intertwined with this is the ques - tion of who consent must be obtained from. Due to the fact that many individuals may be involved in an out - break, and because sequence information about the pathogen in a particular infected individual may give rise to new information about, for example, relational patterns to other infected persons, the question of who exactly , of all the persons involved in an outbreak, should be consenting to the use of such technologies remains a pertinent one. Such information could be rel - evant to a number of parties involved in an outbreak for different reasons, and the interests of those par - ties in that information could, moreover, conflict with each other. Furthermore, informing all the parties may be seen as an unrealistic task, depending on the type and amount of information that needs to be disclosed and who must be informed. This is also relevant to the current management of outbreaks, but molecular techniques give more specificity about the direction - ality of transmission and can be used on a pathogen obtained from one person and interpreted along with information obtained from another person. This makes answering the question to whom disclosures should be made, who should agree to participate and whether full comprehension of the information in itself can be reached even more complex. Return of results Another issue that needs to be addressed when using molecular techniques in outbreak management is the concept of a 'return of results' duty. This concept per - tains to the problem of how and to what extent, or whether (research) information needs to be returned to certain parties, for instance, the individual and/or the public. This is an issue well addressed in biobank - ing, where the debate focuses on treatment options or financial gain [11]. When it comes to outbreak manage - ment, however, the issue is more complex: here it is not only about the (financial or medical) interests of specific individuals directly associated with the inter - vention but also about the many parties involved in an outbreak. The interests and needs of specific individu - als need to balanced with those of the general popula - tion. Furthermore, disclosure of information may be of immediate public health interest and, at the same time, be harmful to the people directly involved. Legal perspective A legal norm or duty and its justification are not the same as a moral norm or duty and its justification. Although the presence and adoption of legal duties are frequently justified (usually at least in part) by ethi - cal arguments, what ultimately validates a legal norm is its recognition by a political and/or legal institution or authority. That is, a legal norm is operationalised through institutional rules and governance structures (ranging from laws and regulations to policies and guidelines). The law attempts to find a coherent posi - tion in balancing population interests versus individual freedoms [13]. The introduction of novel technologies into health systems often brings forth new ethical argu - ments and this may change the perspective on these population interests or individual freedoms. However the present legal norm cannot easily be changed and cannot even always be directly met by new jurisdiction [13]. When it comes to the legal framework for controlling infectious diseases and the protection of public health; using molecular techniques may not even be a problem in many European countries [14]. Public health law in many countries already makes surveillance legally pos - sible without explicit patient consent [14]; however, to what extent this includes a legal possibility for micro - biological research and molecular typing in outbreak management is not well defined. Conclusion In light of the ability of molecular techniques to show potential relational patterns between people and that this may fuel public discussions about who is respon - sible for an infection or outbreaks, it is essential to not only address operational challenges related to use of such techniques in outbreak management, but also to shape the conditions under which they can be used in practice. Reflection on these conditions may not result in closure of the ethical debate on topics such as pri - vacy, consent and moral obligation to avoid infecting others, but it can offer guidance to public health pro - fessionals who use these techniques in source and contact tracing. Call for ethical reflection In this context, the Dutch Municipal Health Service GGD Midden-Nederland focuses on the ethical questions concerning the use of molecular typing techniques in the control of infectious diseases. Our current pro - ject, supported by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) through the regional support fund for reinforcement of infec - tious disease control, aims at combining public health ethics with practice. We warmly invite public health professionals, especially microbiologists, to put their reflections on the conditions under which molecular techniques should be used in source and contact trac - ing in writing (send them by email to ethiektraining@ggdmn.nl before 15 March 2013).109 www.eurosurveillance.orgAcknowledgments This work is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Health Welfare and Sport, RIVM, through the regional support fund for rein - forcement of infectious disease control.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20365 Article submitted on 27 June 2012 / published on 17 January 2013 Molecular-based surveillance of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand contributed to the implementation of interventions that led to a 50% reduction in notified and hospitalised cases of the country's most impor - tant zoonosis. From a pre-intervention high of 384 per 100,000 population in 2006, incidence dropped by 50% in 2008; a reduction that has been sustained since. This article illustrates many aspects of the suc - cessful use of molecular-based surveillance, including the distinction between control-focused and strategy-focused surveillance and advances in source attri - bution. We discuss how microbial genetic data can enhance the understanding of epidemiological explan - atory and response variables and thereby enrich the epidemiological analysis. Sequence data can be fitted to evolutionary and epidemiological models to gain new insights into pathogen evolution, the nature of associations between strains of pathogens and host species, and aspects of between-host transmission. With the advent of newer sequencing technologies and the availability of rapid, high-coverage genome sequence data, such techniques may be extended and refined within the emerging discipline of genomic epidemiology. The aim of this article is to summarise the experience gained in New Zealand with molecu - lar-based surveillance of campylobacteriosis and to discuss how this experience could be used to further advance the use of molecular tools in surveillance. Controlling campylobacteriosis - recent successes Molecular tools are being used increasingly to inform the control of enteric zoonosis worldwide [1] and to meet a wide range of public health aims and objec - tives [2-4]. In New Zealand, a country with a histori - cally high rate of campylobacteriosis notifications [5,6], results from molecular-based surveillance in a sentinel site founded in 2005 - where human cases and potential sources were sampled and typed by mul - tilocus sequence typing (MLST) simultaneously over consecutive years [7,8] - provided strong evidence that a large proportion of human cases were linked poul - try meat consumption. These findings contributed to a mounting body of evidence [5,9] and stimulated the implementation of regulatory and voluntary control strategies along the poultry supply chain. They were announced in 2007 and fully implemented in 2008 (when they became mandatory) [10], resulting in a 50% reduction in disease incidence of cases in 2008 com - pared with the previous high level during 2002 to 2006 [10,11]. Campylobacteriosis notifications in humans were markedly above the reference value until 2008, when the incidence dropped considerably (Figure 1); a likely effect of a reduction in poultry-associated cases due to the implementation of the control strategies in the poul - try supply chain [10,11]. No comparable changes in the annual incidence of other enteric notifiable diseases were observed over the same time period (2002-2011) (Figure 1). Sustained decline in campylobacteriosis case numbers has been shown to have additional health and economic benefits by, for example reducing the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoim - mune condition associated with prior Campylobacter spp. infection [12]. Furthermore, in the New Zealand sentinel surveillance site, a dominant poultry-associated MLST sequence type of C. jejuni (ST-474) was identified that, to date, has been reported rarely from other countries. Before the implementation of the poultry interventions, ST-474 accounted for 30% of human cases in the sen - tinel site [14,15], but in 2010-11, it was isolated from less than 5% of cases [16]. Figure 2 shows the dramatic reduction in two major poultry-associated genotypes, ST-474 and ST-48 (Figure 2, panel A), and provides a comparison with other STs over the same time period (Figure 2, panels B and C). 111 www.eurosurveillance.orgFocused molecular epidemiological studies have been contributing to our understanding of the epidemiol - ogy of this widespread disease both in New Zealand and elsewhere [7,14,15,17]. For example, the associa - tion between ruminant-associated genotypes and pre - school-age children (0-5 years of age) in rural areas has provided evidence for direct contact with faecal material being the foremost infection route in this high-incidence group [14]. This is of high relevance for the development and eval - uation of appropriate, country-specific control strate - gies to decrease the human disease burden. Since the number of human cases linked to poultry has fallen in New Zealand, there has been a relative increase in importance of ruminant strains of C. jejuni , and ongo - ing work is investigating the complex epidemiology of Campylobacter in ruminant [18] and wildlife sources [19]. While this article describes the MLST-supported Campylobacter surveillance conducted at the sentinel site, other typing approaches are used to increase reso - lution of the molecular analysis. For example, research is currently underway to further differentiate between exposure to ruminant-associated Campylobacter sub- types of food and non-food origin to refine attribution estimates using antigen gene sequence typing [20], ribosomal MLST [21] and targeted genes identified by whole genome analysis [22]. In this article, we summa - rise the experience gained in New Zealand and discuss how this experience could be used to further advance the use of molecular tools in surveillance. What have we learned? Experience from New Zealand and elsewhere has pro - vided insight into key aspects of molecular-based surveillance. These include the following: (i) its appli - cation to both control-focused and strategy-focussed surveillance; (ii) a change in our definition of epidemio - logical response variables; and (iii) the emergence of genomic epidemiology. Application of molecular tools to disease surveillance The framework developed by Baker et al. [23], which differentiates between control-focused and strategy-focused surveillance, provides a meaningful way to Figure 1 Relative ratesa of notification of campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis and yersiniosis, New Zealand, 2002-2011 compared with 1999-2001 a Rates were calculated using a negative binomial model, which was used to estimate the change in incidence between each year from 2002 to 2011 and the reference period of interest, 1999-2001, as previously described by Henao et al. [13]. Values above the reference line indicate increases in notification incidence and points below the line show decreases, relative to the 1999-2001 reference period. The pre- and post-intervention periods refer to the implementation of a number of control measures in the poultry supply chain by the regulatory authority. The annual incidence of other enteric notifiable diseases (cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis and yersiniosis) over the same time period is displayed to show that notification rates were stable for other comparable disease and that the drop in campylobacteriosis notifications was not a surveillance artefact.

Approaches that are suitable for control-focused surveillance, such as those used in an outbreak setting, are potentially of lesser value for strategy-focused sur - veillance, where the aim is often to monitor long-term changes in epidemiology [24,25], and vice versa. The purpose of control-focused surveillance is 'to iden - tify each occurrence of a particular disease, hazard, or other health-related event that requires a specific response, and to support the delivery of an effective intervention' [23]. Such surveillance requires methods that have a high degree of timeliness, sensitivity and security (i.e. that can be maintained on an ongoing basis) [23]. The molecular typing tools and associated modelling approaches required for this objective need to be capable of identifying genotypes that indicate a common source of disease or highlight a particular transmission pathway. Often, but not always, this is achieved through highly discriminatory typing tools. Using a recently developed model-based tool for iden - tifying clusters of campylobacteriosis cases related in space and time [26], eight cases in a small area of New Zealand's North Island were identified as having a high probability (>0.8) of being part of an anomalous cluster (i.e. they were more spatially and temporally localised than would be expected given the average temporal and spatial patterns). Inspection of the epidemiologi - cal information linked to each case revealed that they were reported within a single two-week period and typing data showed that they were all the same MLST sequence type (ST-520). When compared with a larger database of over 3,000 sequence types isolated from humans, animals and food in New Zealand it was shown that this type was associated with ruminants in New Zealand, but was a relatively uncommon cause of human infection. This finding triggered a more detailed investigation into the cases, requiring further contact with some affected individuals, which revealed that all cases had consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk - a relatively rare risk factor - and that 7/8 cases reported purchasing the milk from the same source farm. This combination of epidemiological information and typ - ing data lead to a local response and also informed the ongoing debate on the national policy concerning the sale of raw milk. The purpose of strategy-focused surveillance is 'to provide information to support prevention strategies to reduce population health risk, such as describing the epidemiology of the annual influenza season and the characteristics of the seasonal influenza viruses' [23]. Such surveillance requires methods that have a high degree of representativeness, completeness (refer - ring to the data recorded with each event) and validity [23]. Different molecular and modelling approaches are required in this instance, with the optimal tools pro - viding information on the long-term epidemiology of a pathogen rather than short-term changes. An example is the recent emergence of new approaches to source attribution using molecular subtyping, which has been used successfully in several countries to understand the relative contribution of different sources to the burden of human campylobacteriosis and salmonello - sis [27-30]. Source attribution models based on micro - bial subtyping were initially developed in Denmark as a tool for salmonellosis risk management [31]; they provide estimates of the number of human cases origi - nating from different sources or reservoirs based on a comparison of genotypes [31,32]. In New Zealand, attribution models were adapted to data from the MLST surveillance site. Two mod - els were used, a population genetics-based attribu - tion model [32] and the by Hald et al. [31], to quantify the contribution of selected sources to the human disease burden. These studies revealed that between 2005 and 2008, poultry was the leading source of human campylo - bacteriosis, causing an estimated 58-76%, of notified cases [8]. Contributions by individual poultry suppliers showed wide variation and supplier specific strains were detected [15]. The use of these models to monitor changes over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions is ongoing [10,11]. Re-defining response and explanatory variables using molecular tools - a new epidemiological approach to inform surveillance? A common starting point of epidemiology is seeking non-random associations between response variables and potential explanatory variables. Regression mod - elling, for example, may be used to identify statisti - cally significant predictors of increased risk of adverse health effects [33]. However, the use of such traditional methods for quantifying the contribution of different sources of campylobacteriosis to the disease burden in New Zealand (notably case-control studies [9,34], which identified poultry as the major source of human infection) had not provided sufficient compelling evi - dence for decision-makers to invest in controlling the poultry source. The epidemiology of campylobacteri - osis is challenging: as a multi-host pathogen, infection with C. jejuni is associated with a large number of risk factors [35] and human cases arising from exposure to different sources may have very different risk fac - tors, some of which may even be protective for some sources and increase the risk for others. Using molecular tools, pathogen genetics and evolu - tion can be incorporated into epidemiological model - ling to make inferences about disease or transmission risks rather than simply relying on the association of response and explanatory variables. Such tools can be used to refine outcome variables, for example by using case-case comparison of poultry- and ruminant-associated cases of campylobacteriosis to identify more subtle associations [14,17] or to investigate the cause of a disease outbreak [24]. However, greater epidemiological gains are likely to be made when mod - els combine pathogen evolution and transmission in 114 www.eurosurveillance.organ integrated way [36,37]. This may be best achieved by modelling a relatively low number of isolates with high-coverage sequence data, such as increasingly available full genome data [38] or a larger number of isolates with low coverage such as a 7-locus MLST scheme. The additional information provided even by routinely applied molecular tools such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) adds to our understanding of epidemiological variables. For example, the level of similarity and relatedness of restriction-enzyme pro - files in the analysis of a food-borne outbreak can be directly used to refine epidemiological investigations. It is the synergy between the epidemiological and typ - ing information that makes molecular tools so power - ful and novel modelling approaches are constantly being developed to advance research at this interface [39,40]. Into the future: genomic epidemiology New modelling approaches are being adopted to utilise the abundance of molecular data available [24,39,40]. Bell et al. [41] argue that the enormous volumes of data that can be provided by new technology provides many challenges for data management and analysis, and that we have entered a new area of data-intensive science that requires specialised skills and analytical tools. This argument holds true in the area of molec - ular epidemiology: next generation high throughput sequencing has vastly increased the availability of pathogen genome sequence data [38] and as the costs decrease, these tools will be more frequently incorpo - rated into epidemiological studies and surveillance. By fitting statistical genetics and epidemiological models to sequence data, and combining these within a single framework [42], new insights can be gained into path - ogen evolution, the nature of associations between strains of pathogens and host species, the timing of emergence, origin and geographical spread of patho - gens, and aspects of between-host transmission [43]. Furthermore, advances in statistical methods for mod - elling evolutionary ancestry are resulting in better reconstructions of pathogen genealogies and improved estimates of evolutionary parameters. Although com - plex in nature, these models can be extremely valuable - for example, they can be used to enable the contribu - tion of different sources and transmission pathways to the human disease burden to be determined [32]. In New Zealand, whole genome sequencing is being used to understand the evolution of epidemiologi - cally important strains of C. jejuni and identify poten - tial markers for host association [44]. This may help to improve the discrimination of sources of human infection, such as between cattle and sheep, and result in more precise source attribution estimates. Similarly, full genome sequence data from multiple Campylobacter isolates and Escherichia coli O157 are being combined with phenotypic microarray data to improve the understanding of the relationship between phenotype and genotype. The identification of genetic markers for stress resistance, such as pH, temperature, oxidative stress, and freeze-thaw [45], could help to determine which sources and transmission pathways strains isolated from humans have been acquired from, further refining attribution studies and strategy-focused surveillance. By furthering our understanding of host associations with particular strains of pathogens, and the relative rates of transmission between animals and humans, the melding of statistical genetics and epidemiology with partial and full genome sequence data will further inform and refine control strategies for enteric patho - gens in New Zealand and elsewhere. Conclusion New Zealand provides a distinctive island ecosystem in which to study infectious diseases [46]. The rela - tive isolation and management of farmed livestock has contributed to the epidemiology and population structure of microbial pathogens. For example, the country's poultry industry is structured in a way that is different to most countries, with no importation of untreated poultry products and freedom from several important poultry diseases such as Newcastle dis - ease and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis PT4. Furthermore, the production of poultry meat is highly integrated, with three companies supplying about 90% of all chicken meat [15]. In addition a risk management strategy developed by the regulator supports a strong collaboration with researchers and science-based deci - sion-making [47]. While the situation in other countries is likely to be more complex, for example through the presence of federal regulations or the risks associated with poultry importations, lessons learned from New Zealand can be applied elsewhere. The New Zealand approach, which includes the first large scale implementation of effective regulatory Campylobacter control measures in broilers, is of high relevance internationally, including Europe. Findings have been incorporated in scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority. In 2008, it was acknowledged that the MLST approach to source attri - bution developed in New Zealand may be the way for - ward [48] and the approach is being used in several European countries, including the Netherlands and Scotland [2,49]. The New Zealand experience was also included in an assessment of the extent to which meat derived from broilers contributes to human campylo - bacteriosis at the European Union level [50]. The molecular tools deployed in epidemiological and evolutionary analyses clearly need to be fit-for-purpose. Ideally, during their development phase, measures of their utility in specific settings, such as discriminatory power and the strength of association between genotype and host, should be considered and attempts made to optimise their performance for the outcome in mind. In the case of 7-locus MLST, for example, retrospective analyses have shown this to be a valuable approach for certain types of surveillance, 115 www.eurosurveillance.orgincluding reservoir attribution, but the method was not designed for this purpose and an alternative approach based on a different set of gene targets may perform better and be more cost-effective. Equally important are rigorous sampling size considerations and guid - ance on the number of samples from different sources to acquire a desired level of precision - for example, in source attribution estimates. Further work will be nec - essary to develop expert agreement and sound work - ing principles on these matters. The field of molecular epidemiology is continually evolving and its role in advancing our ability to under - stand and control infectious diseases will also keep increasing. Its interdisciplinary nature will provide key support to One Health approaches to disease control, by supplementing medical and veterinary expertise with an in-depth understanding of the molecular biol - ogy of pathogens. As genotyping approaches and ana - lytical models continue to evolve, an understanding of the complex interface of both disciplines becomes a crucial element of molecular-based disease surveil - lance. In New Zealand, we have learned that close col - laboration between laboratories and epidemiologists is extremely important for the success of molecular-based surveillance: in our example, this started when the sentinel surveillance site was first set up. In a small and geographically isolated country, such early collaboration is likely to be more easily achieved; nev - ertheless, the general principle still applies and could add value to molecular surveillance in other countries.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20374 Article published on 17 January 2013 While it is clear that surveillance and outbreak inves - tigations are increasingly supported by advanced molecular approaches, it is less clear how the future of such tools will evolve. Even if they will most probably not render traditional epidemiological methods super - fluous, they will certainly gain importance and a num - ber of questions concerning their use in public health remain to be answered. How will both approaches interact in the future? Will they work hand in hand? How will the current operational constraints be over - come, to allow these advanced techniques to be used in public health practice? In response to a call for papers [1], a special issue is being published. In the first part, we focus on exam - ples of the value and opportunities of molecular meth - ods in analysing a number of diseases. In the second part, we draw attention to issues related to their wider use in surveillance, prevention and control of infec - tious diseases. In so doing, we hope to stimulate dis - cussion and add to the debate on the role and potential of modern molecular microbiology to inform public health action. References 1.

Euro Surveill. 2013;18(3):pii=20357. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20357 Article published on 17 January 2013 The European Surveillance System (TESSy) molecu - lar surveillance service (MSS) was launched in late November 2012. This new service enables European Union and European Economic Area countries to upload detailed molecular typing data for Salmonella , Listeria , E. culosis (MDR-TB) to the MSS database, hosted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). So far, 13 countries are providing data for the three food and waterborne pathogens, and it is likely that more countries will join the system in 2013. For M. tuberculosis , 23 countries are currently providing molecular typing data. It is likely that in the future, more pathogens will be added to the MSS. The objective of the data is to (i) improve the speed of detection of dispersed international outbreaks, (ii) improve trace-back of the source of an outbreak and identify risk factors, and (iii) improve investigation of transmission chains across the EU and globally, and (iv) improve Member State response to outbreaks. Nominated users in countries can query ECDC data - bases to see if isolates that are genetically similar to isolates found in their country have been detected in other countries. A team of curators guarantees the quality of the data and also performs routine clus - ter detection. If a cluster is found, countries can then use this cluster information for possible public health action. In such cases, the ECDC Epidemic Intelligence Information System will be used as before to help coor - dinate action across countries for Salmonella , Listeria and E. coli whereas the European Reference Laboratory Network for TB would be used in the case of MDR-TB.
