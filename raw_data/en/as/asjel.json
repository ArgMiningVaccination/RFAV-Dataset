Annual Report 2008 3In fiscal 2007, the midway point of the second medium-term management plan, the measures we have introduced and implemented began to yield results, and we achieved recordprofits. With these and other accomplishments, we have estab-lished a solid foundation for further growth. In fiscal 2008,under a new management structure, the Shionogi Group willwork together toward further growth centered on the prescrip-tion drug business and accelerate the establishment of a foun-dation for global development as it moves to achieve the goalsof the second medium-term management plan. Performance in Fiscal 2007 Business cond itions in the pharmaceutical in dustry in Japan remained challeng ing in fiscal 2007, the year en ded March 31, 2008 . The g overnment further streng thened policies to contain the cost of pharmaceuticals, inclu ding promo- tion of g eneric d rug use and the Diag nosis Related Group/Prospective Payment System (DRG/PPS), in or der to restrain rising healthcare costs. At the same time, competition in sales an d marketing and R&D that includ es global corporations intensifie d further. Under these cond itions, the Shionog i Group continued to aggressively prepare for lon g-term g rowth centered on the prescription drug business in line with the secon d med ium-term manag ement plan (from April 2005 throu gh March 2010). As a result, consoli dated net sales increase d 7.3 percent compared with the previous year to \u00a5214.3 billion. Growth in sales of prescription drugs and higher royalty income from ind ustrial property rig hts contrib uted to an increase in gross profit, which ab sorb ed the increase in research and development expenses and selling expenses. Operatin g income thus increased 40.0 percent to \u00a540.4 b illion, a record high, and net income rose 34. 8 percent to \u00a525.1 billion. Shionog i's basic policy for profit distrib ution is to stead ily increase d ividends in line with performance while aggres- sively investing in its b usiness to enhance corporate value with a med ium-to-long -term perspective. Base d on this policy, Shionog i paid a year-end dividend of \u00a512 per share. Comb ined with the interim dividend, total d ividends for fiscal 2007 were \u00a522 per share, an increase of \u00a56 per share from the previous year, resultin g in a payout ratio of 29.6 percent. Toward Higher Corporate Value On April 1, 2008 , Isao Teshirog i was appointed presid ent of Shionog i. Estab lishing a global development and mar- keting structure while enhancing the d evelopment pipeline and streng thening the d omestic sales force will remain criti- cal to the Company' s growth. Und er the new manag ement structure centere d on Presid ent Teshirog i, Shionog i will concentrate on achievin g the g oals of the secon d med ium-term manag ement plan, and move even more aggressively to globalize its operations to ensure lon g-term g rowth. We look forward to the continuing support and guidance of our sharehold ers and all our stakehol ders. Current Progress, Our Stakeholders August Shiono Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. How would you assess Shionogi's performance in fiscal 2007, the first year of the revised manage-ment plan? We announced the revise d version of the med ium- term mana gement plan in April 2007. Chairman Shiono was presid ent in the first year of the revise d plan, and he was strong ly determined to d o whatever it takes to achieve our g oals. Und er his lead ership, we mad e smooth prog ress in b oth research and development and sales and marketing based on the b usiness infrastructure create d throug h our g rowth strate gy and the reforms we have implemente d. As a result, sales an d profits increased \u2014 in fact, profits reache d their hig hest level since the Company was pub licly listed . In research an d development, Shionog i focused invest- ment of resources on the three tar get areas of infectious diseases, pain an d metab olic syn drome, as well as frontier areas such as aller gy treatments. Our promisin g drug can- didates are ad vancing throug h sta ges on sched ule. Currently, S-2367 (anti-o besity ag ent) is in Phase IIb clinical trials, S-777469 (ag ent for atopic dermatitis) an d S-0218 12 (anti-influenza ag ent) are in Phase IIa, an d S-349572 (anti-HIV a gent) is in Phase I. In sales an d marketing , we expand ed sales b y concen- tratin g resources on Crestor\u00ae, a core prod uct. in Japan' s pharmaceutical mar- ket remain challeng ing due to factors includ ing the Diag nosis Related Group/Prospective Payment System (DRG/PPS) for med ical expenses, red uction of National Health Insurance (NHI) drug prices, an d promotion of the use of g eneric d rugs. In these cond itions, Crestor\u00ae achieved substantial sales g the sixth statin-b treatment on the market. Crestor\u00aehas g rown into a prod uct with annual sales of over \u00a510 b illion, which is hig hly sig nificant. As a result, in fiscal 2007, Shiono gi increased sales of prescription drugs in Japan for the first time in ei ght years. This g ives me confid ence that our strate gy of concentrating promotional efforts on fewer prod ucts will yiel d substantial b enefits. Moreover, I b elieve that this performance is also a result of our focus on sales an d marketing activities intend ed to restore Shionog i's trad itional stren gth in the hospital stea dily implemented various new ini- tiatives inclu ding the ad option of new med ical representa- tive (MR) performance evaluations centere d on Crestor\u00aeIsao Teshirogi, who was appointed president of Shionogi in April 2008, discusses the progress and results of the second medium-term management plan and Shionogi's businessstrategies for fiscal 2008 and beyond. 4Interview with President Isao Teshirogi Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. President and Representative Director SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 5and other new pro ducts, special trainin g prog rams for MRs responsib le for ad vanced treatment hospitals, an d lectures and forums for clinicians. On the other hand , several important tasks remain to be dealt with. Althoug h strateg ic prod ucts such as Crestor\u00ae, anal gesic OxyContin\u00aeand allerg are also strate gic products targeted for sales expansion, were lower than expecte d. In addition, manu- facturing cost red uctions fell short of our tar get, which is partly attrib utab le to the external factor of hi gher oil and raw material prices. These are major issues that we nee d to address. Chairman Shiono placed the highest priority on accelerating expansion of overseas business whenhe was president. What is your mission asShionogi's new president and what are your ideasfor Shionogi's continuing growth in the next fiveto ten years? When Chairman Shiono b ecame presid ent in 1999, he foresaw the future contraction of the domestic prescrip- tion drug market, an d set a future strateg y for overseas expansion focusin g on the prescription d rug business. In building the infrastructure to support its entry into over- seas markets, throu gh the first and second med ium-term plans, we stead ily restructured our b usiness operations toconcentrate on prescription drugs, and reformed our R&D structure so that we woul d always have at least six or seven orig inal compound s in our pipeline in clinical devel- opment. We now have a well-stocke d development pipeline and are positioned for full-scale overseas expan- sion. Therefore, I b elieve that the responsib ility inherite d from Chairman Shiono is to esta blish a strong overseas business platform. Specifically, Crestor\u00aeis now g enerating healthy royalty income, which contri butes d irectly to g rowth in operating income. We expect this royalty income to increase to \u00a560 billion in fiscal 2009. However, because the patents on Crestor\u00aewill expire from 2016 to 2017, we nee d to create a structure over the next ei ght years to support continu- ous g rowth to replace that \u00a560 billion. I consid er this my most important mission. To ensure Shionog i's continuous g rowth, it is vital that we launch at least two or three ori ginal world -class d rugs with strong growth potential over the next ei ght years, and estab lish infrastructure capa ble of expand ing their sales. If we expect to achieve a certain level of sales in2016 to 2017, then calculatin g backward , we need to file new d rug applications (NDAs) for those drugs five years before that time, an d obtain approval an d begin sales no later than three years before. Cand idate d rugs are those that will be in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials at the en d of fiscal 2009, the last year of the secon d med ium-term manag ement plan. The compoun ds currently in our pipeline that qualify, in a ddition to S-2367, S-777469 an d 0100250350 200300 (Billions of yen)Operating Income \u0010\u0001Net Income (FY)Operating income Net income medium-term management plan has two years remaining. What measures are you takingto achieve plan targets, and what is your policyfor fiscal 2008? Research and Development In fiscal 2008, we will have as many as five novel com- pounds in Phase II simultaneously: S-2367, for which over- seas Phase IIb trials are already under way, and S-777469,S-349572, S888711 and S-555739. This will require substan-tial development investment. Under the second medium-term management plan, we intend to expand researchand development investment to the \u00a550 billion level in fis-cal 2009, but we need to clarify development prioritiesand invest strategically. We are now conducting clearly prioritized research activities to achieve our goals of moving two or more can-didate compounds into clinical trials and creating four ormore development candidates each year. We are alsofocusing on measures to enhance new drug discovery. Aspart of that effort, we held FINDS (PHarma-INnovationDiscovery competition Shionogi), a drug discovery com-petition for the purpose of uncovering the seeds of origi-nal new drugs, for the second time in June 2008. The firstFINDS competition in fiscal 2007 attracted 242 entries,mainly from universities in Japan, and we selected 11 ofthem. Impact and response to the results has been con-siderable. Going forward, we plan to invite governmentinstitutions and private think tanks to participate, and willeven consider expanding the program overseas in themedium-to-long term, with the aim of converting dormantideas from around the world into Shionogi products.Through these and other measures, we will work toexpand and enhance new drug discovery and steadilymove the resulting compounds into our research program.S-349572, are S-888711, a thrombocytopenia treatment,and S-555739, a treatment for allergic diseases, which arecurrently in Phase I, as well as compounds for which clini-cal trials are set to begin during fiscal 2008. I believe thatlaunching two or three of these is absolutely necessary. If we can significantly expand sales centered on these new products in overseas markets by 2016 to 2017, andadd those to sales growth in the domestic market, Ibelieve we will be able to cover the decrease in operatingincome due to expiration of the patents on Crestor \u00ae. By doing so, we will contribute to society as a company thatis capable of sustained growth. How do you plan to upgrade Shionogi's organiza- tional framework to achieve this major expansionof overseas sales? In research and development, we plan to create infra- structure that enables us to develop multiple original products simultaneously in Japan, the United States andEurope. Currently, we are cultivating our own overseasdevelopment expertise through Shionogi USA, our devel-opment subsidiary in the United States, but we will alsoconsider co-development with other companies dependingon each product's growth potential. For example, S-2367is currently in Phase IIb, but from Phase III we would liketo select a co-development and co-marketing partner withstrong development and marketing capabilities in the U.S.primary care market. In Europe, we will need a developmentbase as early as fiscal 2009, and plan to begin concretestudies for it. In marketing, while our decisions will partly hinge on the development status of S-2367, which is currently theitem furthest along in clinical trials, we plan to choosemarketing partners according to the potential of eachproduct. This does not include anti-HIV agents such asS-349572, which is under development and will be market-ed by Shionogi-GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals. We willalso consider establishing our own marketing network inthe United States. The new research laboratory, slated for completion in 2010, will be our core research facility. SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 7Current Progress, Lon g-Term Poten tial How do you plan to reduce manufacturing and other costs, which is one of your stated manage-ment priorities? Cost of sales is currently at a bout 32 percent of net sales. This is hi gh relative to other companies in the in dus- try, so we have set challen ging targ ets and are moving to increase prod uctivity and improve procurement. We plan to red uce manufacturing costs b y expand ing prod uction of solid dosag e forms of Irb etan\u00ae, pirfenid one and other drugs at a new \u00a56 b illion facility at the Settsu Plant that is sched uled to b e completed in fall 2008 . In addition, we will move to build a systematic prod uction system in ord er to expand exports of carb apenem antib iotic Dori bax\u00ae (doripenem), for which Johnson & Johnson receive d approval in the Unite d States in Octo ber 2007. Our first manag ement task will be red ucing selling , general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Exclu ding research an d development expenses, SG&A expenses are equivalent to ab out 30 percent of net sales. We believe this level can b e red uced consid erab ly. In particular, we plan to integ rate the work of ind irect support d ivisions that function as cost centers into divisions directly involved in sales, which are profit centers. As a result, we will chan ge the mind set of support personnel to a per- spective of operatin g as part of a profit center, while also streamlining head office functions. In a ddition, we intend to strateg ically consid er how to make the b est use of external resources, includ ing subsidiaries. For a company of Shiono gi's size to g row consistently, it also must maintain pro ductivity per employee at a hi gh- er level than other companies. That places stron g demand s on our employees to increase their capa bilities. We therefore inten d to enhance training prog rams to help individual employees d o so, and raise their skill levelsWe are also expan ding collab orative research with uni- versities. In May 200 8, we opened the Shionog i Innovation Center for Dru g Discovery on the campus of Hokkai do University. In a ddition, to expan d our research capacity, we have d ecided to invest approximately \u00a514 billion to build a new research lab oratory that will become our core research facility. Construction is slate d for completion in 2010. In development, we have five can didate compound s in the d rug cand idate selection e: an analg agent, and a molecular tar geted anti-cancer d rug. Other compound s, such as S-2367, are moving stead ily throug h clinical d evelopment. Sales and Marketing Activities In sales and marketing activities, we plan to expan d sales b y continuing to concentrate resources on new prod ucts, with a focus on Crestor\u00ae. First, we will con duct extensive promotional activities for Crestor\u00aeand antihy- pertensive Ir betan\u00aeto area of metab olic synd rome. We will also focus on effi- ciently expand ing sales of strate gic prod ucts such as Finib ax\u00aeand Avelox\u00aein the area of infectious diseases and OxyContin\u00aein the area of pain throu gh lectures, ed uca- tional activities and other initiatives. Finally, we will work to ensure the successful launches of Differin\u00ae Gel, a topical treatment for acne vul garis, and pirfenid one, a treatment for id iopathic pulmonary fib rosis. Throug h these actions, we will stead ily achieve our sales tar gets. In efforts to stren gthen sales and marketing , our inter- views with med ical professionals an d others ind icate that Shionog i's messag e is g etting throug h. However, the results of our promotional activities have not been fully reflected in sales. From this perspective, we still have room to improve. The Strateg ic Sales Plannin g Department, estab lished in April 2008 , will strateg ically implement measures that support MR activities, such as determining allocation of resources for the pro ducts we want to focus on, d isting uishing between head office functions and work to b e done b y MRs in the fiel d, and effectively distrib uting sales and marketing costs. financial matters with the intro duction of the Financial Instruments an d Exchang e Act (the Japanese version of the Sarb anes-Oxley Act). While keeping a close eye on social trend s, we will continue to consi der ways to create a more efficient and flexib le framework for b usiness execu- tion. What is Shionogi's stance on shareholder returns, and do you have any closing message for share-holders? As stated in the second med ium-term manag ement plan, we are aimin g for a 35 percent consoli dated divi- dend payout ratio in fiscal 2009. We plan to continue increasin g sharehold er returns in fiscal 2010 an d beyond , but the Company is still at the stag e where we have to b alance shar eholder returns, primarily dividends, with the nee d to use retained earning s for invest- ment in future growth. Shionog i is proud to b e one of the few pharmaceuti-cal manufacturers in Japanthat is well positione d for hig hly profitab le growth. I am confid ent that Shionog i will transform into a stron g, hig hly prod uctive and highly profitab le company. Moreover, while aggressively improving our operations with a sense of urg ency that we will b e left b ehind if we d o not chang e, we welcome the frank opinions of our sharehol ders. I ask sharehold ers for their un derstand ing and support as we continue to put our fullest efforts into for ging a unique path for lon g-term g rowth. throug h reg ular personnel rotation. Moreover, we must chang e to an operating structure of hi gh profitab ility and high prod uctivity by improving our personnel policies to accommod ate d iverse lab or requirements, such as rehir- ing baby boomers, in addition to increasin g the capab ili- ties of each employee. What is Shionogi's thinking in regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate gover-nance? Shionog i's corporate philosophy is \"to strive constantly to provid e med icine of the b est possib le kind essential for protection of the health of the people.\" Implementin g this philosophy is at the heart of Shiono gi's CSR efforts as a pharmaceutical company. Part of our vision for the worl d in the second med ium-term manag ement plan is the estab lishment of a pain-free society, an d we are taking ongoing measures aimed at freeing all cancer patients from pain. For example, we ran a television commercial to educate people ab out cancer pain treatments, an d launched a web site entitled \"Don' t Tolerate Cancer Pain.\" We will continue to contrib ute to society throug h activ- ities such as our lon g-running support for music culture via music prog rams on television an d our research support prog ram that includ es donations to the Cell Science Research Found ation, which helps cultivate youn g researchers. These activities are not thin gs that can b e accomplished overnig ht, and we must b e committed to continuing them even if b usiness results are poor. Regarding environmental issues, while environmental measures often increase costs for companies, we believe that they shoul d absorb these costs an d work to achieve their corporate ob jectives. This commitment is part of Shionog i's DNA, and has b een hand ed down unchang ed from Chairman Shiono to myself, an d to all employees. In my view, it is part of what makes Shiono gi an appealin g company. In corporate governance, the ob jective an d outspoken advice we receive from outsi de corporate aud itors serves as a positive stimulus an d energ izes the Board of Directors. I feel we have ma de sig nificant prog ress in achieving manag ement ob I intend to strive for a mana gement structure of even hi gher quality.

Annual Report 2008 9Corporate Governance Management Structure The Board of Directors is composed of five d irectors and meets once a month in principle, to make decisions on matters affectin g manag ement, and supervises b usi- ness execution. The term of office of d irectors is one year in ord er to respond swiftly to chan ges in the operatin g environment and clarify d irectors' responsib ilities. Moreover, the Company has intro duced a corporate officer system to b uild a flexib le and agile business execu- tion structure that ena bles swift response to chan ges in the operatin g environment. The Corporate Executive Meeting , composed of the d irectors and corporate offi- cers, meets every week in principle to deliberate matters of business execution. Auditing Structure The Company has two stand ing corporate aud itors and two outsid e corporate aud itors. The corporate au ditors attend meeting s of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Executive Meetin g and other important meeting s, offering opinions when necessary. To ensure mana gement trans- parency, they also check and evaluate the le gality and propriety of d irectors' and corporate officers' activitiesthroug h work and accounting aud its in accord ance with corporate au diting stand ards. While cooperatin g with the ind epend ent aud itors and the Internal Control Unit, an internal au diting department, in aud iting and counseling , the corporate au ditors reg u- larly exchang e opinions with the representative d irectors in ord er to ensure the effectiveness of au dits. Strengthening the Internal Control System Pursuant to the Companies Act, in May 2006 the Boar d of Directors ad opted the Basic Policy for Buil ding an Internal Control System to create a system for ensurin g appropriate b usiness operations at Shiono gi. Since then, Shionog i has worke d to estab lish the system throu ghout the Group. In addition, the Company continues to streng then and enhance the system throu gh annual revi- sions of matters for resolution by the Board of Directors, based on the past year 's activities. Sincere efforts to ensure the relia bility of financial statements are necessary for maintainin g manag ement transparency and integ rity. To comply with the Internal Control Report System un der the Financial Instruments and Exchang e Act, Shionog i estab lished an internal pro- ject team to upg rade internal control over financial report- ing while optimizin g the Company' s IT environment. As part of these efforts, the presi dent of Shionog i sent a messag e to all Group employees in April 200 8, when the system went into effect, to promote their awareness an d adoption. His messa ge stressed the importance of relia ble financial reportin g. Action Guidelines Shionog i contrib utes to the maintenance of health an d ensuring comfortab le lives for people aroun d the world . As such, Shionog i's aim in all its d aily activities is to be of use to customers, patients, sharehol ders and society in general, an d the personal betterment of its employees.

We increased the transparency of drug discovery research strate gies throug h a prog ram lead er system, and flexib ly real- located resources throu gh quarterly milestone mana gement. We also clarifie d the role of committees an d increased decision-makin g speed . These proactive measures have facilitate d unpreced ented research prog ress, and we have succeed ed in consistently creating four new d rug development cand idates in each of the last three years. In particular, in fiscal 2006, the ri gorous selection criteria we set le d to d evelop- ment cand idates with excellent properties an d enab led us to d ramatically re duce the dropout rate after selection. The fact that all of the compoun ds except for one that is currently und ergoing GLP testin g advanced to Phase I d emonstrates the hi gh quality of our d evelopment cand idates. In fiscal 2007, we generated four new evelopment cand i- dates: an alleviator are cond ucting non-clinical trials of these com- pound s, and are aiming to move them quickly into clinical trials. New Research Facility to Be Built in Toyonaka Althoug h information technolo gy has improved tools for exchang ing information in real time, the importance of opportunities for research collea gues to have face-to-face dis- cussions is increasin g in drug discovery research, where diverse research fiel ds are inter- twined in complex ways. In January 200 8, Shionog i decided to construct a new pharmaceu- tical research center in the city of Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, that will not only incorpo- rate an ab undance of the world's most ad vanced new technolog ies, b ut will also provi de a unique space for communication amon g researchers. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers tend to set up numerous b uildings with d ifferent functions, but Shionog i has create d an innovative design that g athers all d rug discovery functions into one giant facility to further build on the internal colla boration cultivate d at the existing Shionog i Research Laboratories. Throug h this new concept, Shiono gi plans to achieve spee d and flexib ility that are unmatche d by the \"meg a-pharmas.\" The Concept behind Joint Development with Hokkaido University One of Shionog i's greatest stren gths is that all researchers en gaged in drug discovery research work in a sin gle location. However, to facilitate the development of new technolo- gies that will support future drug discovery, and enhance the b asic research that forms theThe Pharmaceutical Research Division has made steady progress in the creation of high-potential drug candidates as we move to reach our objective in the second medium-term management plan of having at least five new compounds at Phase II or more advanced stages by the end of fiscal2009. Past the midway point of the five-year plan, in fiscal 2008 we will promote global researchactivities through enhanced collaboration with universities and overseas pharmaceutical companieswhile focusing on heightening our technology, speed and flexibility. Through these efforts, we willbuild a research and development organization that allows us to \"dream big.\" We design candidate compounds for new breakthrough drugs, andsynthesize them chemically. Shionogi's Business Activities Pharmaceutical Research SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 13 foundation of drug discovery, we saw a need to provide an environment that was different from that of the Shionogi Research Laboratories, where researchers are under the pressureof strict timelines. To that end, Shionogi built the Shionogi Innovation Center for DrugDiscovery, the first private research laboratory in Japan on the campus of a public university.The Shionogi Innovation Center for Drug Discovery is a place where young researchers canfreely pursue their dreams through research projects conducted in an academic atmosphere,and it will expand collaboration with Hokkaido University, which has a wealth of researchers.Here, we can cultivate people with a broad outlook and a long-term view. At the sametime, we expect that this facility will foster the breakthrough technologies that will supportdrug discovery research 10 years from now, and give rise to the seeds of new drugs withthe potential to revolutionize healthcare in 20 years. FINDS (PHarma-INnovation Discovery competition Shionogi) In order for Japanese industry and academia to advance together and establish a major presence on the world stage, mutual understanding and collaboration are becoming increasingly important. The key to this is matching innovative ideas in academia with specif-ic industry needs . Accordingly, in fiscal 2007, Shionogi undertook a new initiative: We pre-sented to the public the specified needs of our research laboratories and invited people atdomestic research institutions to submit creative ideas to address those needs. Eventhough it was only the first year, we received 242 submissions, 11 of which led to jointresearch agreements, and research is already under way. We plan to continue this initiativein fiscal 2008, and hope to firmly establish it as a new form of open innovation. Creating a Steady Stream of Original, World-Class Drugs Until now, Shionogi has sought to create new breakthrough drugs by conducting joint development with many researchers around the world. Through this approach,Shionogi has come to realize that the most critical factor for success is the developmentof world-class researchers. In the Pharmaceutical Research Division, we have launched anew program called \"Global Research Leader Training\" that we had been planning overthe previous year, and are developing people who are capable of leading joint researchwith major U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies. We believe synergy with our vari-ous existing training programs will help us to become a world-class research organizationand develop the seeds of highly original new drugs. At the same time, we will strengthenjoint research with domestic and overseas universities, start-up companies and mega-pharmas. As a result, we expect to generate a steady stream of original, world-class drugs. Current Progress, Long-Term Potential Hirosato Kondo, Ph.D. Corporate Officer, Executive General Manager,Pharmaceutical Research Division Analyzing the chemical struc- ture of candidate compoundsusing cutting-edge equipment 14To achieve the objectives of the second medium-term management plan, Shionogi is quickly making go/no go decisions on development compounds and formulating product strategies that cut across the entire company in an effort to maximize the value of each compound. Eyeing growthduring the next medium-term management plan and beyond, we are also accelerating the estab-lishment of our own global development capabilities and focusing on creation of our third andfourth global products to follow Crestor \u00aeand Doribax\u00ae.Shionogi's Business Activities Pharmaceutical Development Progress of the Second Medium-Term Management Plan The Pharmaceutical Development Division is spee ding up the d evelopment process by concentrating resources on tar get areas and specific projects as well as actively utilizin g external resources. The Division also teams up with the Pharmaceutical Research Division and domestic and overseas acad emic institutions to apply the latest scientific technolo gies. Throug h these approaches, we are workin g to increase the pro bability of success in pro d- uct d evelopment. Among orig inal d evelopment compoun ds (includ ing compound s created throug h joint research), an anti-HIV d rug has entered Phase IIa trials in the targ et area of infectious d is- eases, and an ob esity treatment is now in Phase II b in the area of metab olic synd rome. In the frontier area, S-777469, a treatment for atopic dermatitis, is currently in Phase IIa an d S- 888711, a treatment for throm bocytopenia, has alread y been confirmed to increase platelet count in testin g on healthy ad ult volunteers. We also plan to con duct proof of mechanism (POM) trials d uring fiscal 2008 for S-555739, a treatment for allerg ic diseases. As a result, we are on track to achieve our goal of having at least five new chemical entities in Phase II or more ad vanced stag es by the end of the second med ium-term plan. As a rule, we inten d to d evelop these orig inal d rugs globally, b ut are neg otiating the best type of alliance for each one, depend ing on the scale of development and marketing . Our ob jective is to use strate gic alliances to further accelerate our esta blishment of d evel- opment an d marketing capab ilities in Europe an d North America. Since fiscal 2005, we have au gmented our d omestic pipeline by adding Differin\u00aeGel, a novel topical treatment for acne vul garis that receive d manufacturing and marketing approval in July 2008 , and peramivir, an anti-influenza drug in preparation for Phase III. In addition, throu gh cooperation with the Marketin g Department, the Human Health Care Division and other relevant d epartments, a cross- divisional framework that reflects market need s in d evelopment plans has b egun to take shape. By formulatin g concerted Company-wid e prod uct strateg ies, we are maximizin g the potential of each pro duct in ways such as adding new formulations (OxiNorm\u00aepowd er, Finib ax\u00ae0.25g IV Solution Kit, Claritin\u00aeDry Syrup e\u00aesustained expan ax\u00ae), and (Crestor\u00ae, Finib ax\u00aeand Imunace\u00ae).

Shionog i USA was formed in 2001 as a first step in building such capab ility in the United States. More recently, Shiono gi USA has evolved from a small team supportin g just one or two early stag e clinical prog rams, into a complex or ganization that supports multiple early an d late stag e efforts inclu ding three Phase II stag e development prog rams in o besity, atopic dermatitis and HIV, as well as a marketed antib iotic, Ce dax\u00ae. In the last year, Shiono gi USA reached several clinical milestones, includ ing the on-time completion of an interim analysis for the two on going 750-sub ject Phase IIb stud ies of S-2367 (velneperit) for o besity. This interim analysis resulte d in a decision to complete the full one-year duration for the two Phase IIb stud ies, which will be completed at the end of 2008 . Another si gnificant milestone was the initiation of a Phase IIa proof-of-concept stu dy of S-777469 for the treatment of atopic d ermatitis. The results of this stu dy are expected early in 2009. Finally, Shionog i's collab oration with GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, which Shiono gi USA supports, also reache d a milestone with the initiation of a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study of S-349572, an HIV integ rase inhib itor. Results of this important clinical stu dy are expected by the end of 2008 , with additional can didates to follow. In terms of Shiono gi's earlier stag e clinical development portfolio, Shiono gi USA has worked closely with the Clinical Research Department in Osaka to prepare for the U.S. devel- opment of several new drug cand idates includ ing for thromb ocytopenia. Tomeet the d emand s of the current portfolio, Shiono gi USA has expand ed its staff in areas such as clinical development, pro- ject manag ement, d rug safety, quality assurance, re gulatory affairs and human resources. In addition to Shiono gi USA' s expand ed clinical d evelop- ment efforts, the last year also inclu ded continued mar- for otitis med ia, pharyng itis, ton- sillitis, acute exacerb ations of chronic b ronchitis. Shionog i USA acquired the sales and distrib ution rig hts to Cedax\u00aein 2004 as an initial step in building the capab ility to support the future U.S. commercialization of the compoun ds in Shionog i's pipeline. Ced ax\u00aesales, marketin g and distrib u- tion are supporte d by a core team within Shiono gi USA along with several contract service provi ders. Shionog i USA will continue to a ggressively support Shionog i & Co., Ltd .'s global clinical and commercial efforts in the future.Over the past year, Shionogi USA reached a number of milestones as it expanded its role in building overseas expertise and infrastructure to support Shionogi's global development and commercialization efforts.

It also expanded the packag ing and storag e areas of one of the existing manufacturing facilities and constructed a new larg e-scale facility for sterile active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to support global sales of carb apenem antib iotic Finib ax\u00ae, shipments of which have begun to overseas markets. In addition, Shionog i expanded its manufacturing facility for cancer pain drugs and created an integ rated system from b ulk pharmaceutical production to formulation and packag ing. Expansion of the existing facility for OxiNorm\u00aepowder 0.5%, an immediate-release formulation of OxyContin\u00ae, is under way to improve productivity and support the steady increase in sales of the product. With these investments, the Kaneg asaki Plant is makin g significant prog ress as a base for supplying cancer pain drug s domestically and antib iotics g lobally. \u0081 Settsu Plant: Leverag ing its many years of expertise in pharmaceutical manufacturing and packag ing technolog y, Shionog i is constructing a new facility for solid dosag e forms that is scheduled for comple- tion in Novemb er 2008 . In addition to manufacturin g new products such as duloxetine hydrochloride, an antidepressant that is awaiting approval, this facility will enab le Shionog i to manufacture diverse new dru g candidate compounds from clinical supply to commercial production levels. By conductin g such a wide variety of manufacturin g in a sing le facility, Shionog i expects to improve the quality of development and accelerate the launch of new products. Shiono gi is also thinkin g of using this facility as a key base for expanding integ rated contract manufacturing services, and aims to use it as a place to most effectively leverag e its manufacturing technolog ies in the entire process from development to commercial production of pharmaceuticals, includin g products of other companies. The Settsu Plant has also b egun commercial production of anti-aller gic Claritin\u00aeDry Syrup and antihypertensive Irbetan\u00ae, and is preparing for the start of commercial production of pirfenidone, a treatment for idio- pathic pulmonary fib rosis awaiting approval, and other new products. \u0081 Kuise Site: As a b ase for chemistry, manufacturin g and controls (CMC) development, the Kuise Site currently conducts develops manufacturing processes and manufactures products for clinical trials. In response to the increase in candidate compounds, Shionog i constructed a new facility for manufac- turing APIs for clinical trials that has more than three times the capacity of the existing facility. With this and existin g facilities, which stren gthen the manufacturin g system for clinical products, Shionog i has enhanced its clinical supply capab ility. The Company also expects to further increase develop- ment speed and quality b y streng thening its synthesis process system. Based on the Company Policy of Shionogi, the Manufacturing Division has established SQDCE as its motto for daily activities. Under this motto, the division has three missions: to manufacture and provide a stable supply of quality drugs at reasonable prices; to contribute to the speedylaunch of new products by promoting R&D focused on the entire process from the initial stages ofdevelopment to commercial production; and to implement product life cycle management throughthe development and application of new formulations to add value to existing products. The Manufacturing Division Motto: SQDCE (Standards of Conduct) S (Safety): Secure the safety of people, materials and equipment, Q (Quality): Manufacture quality products with asophisticated q uality manag ement system, D (Delivery): Bring new products to market on theexpected launch date without delay,while maintaining a stable supply ofexistin g products, C (Cost): Cut costs throu gh reduction of raw material costs and process improve-ments, and E (Environment): Reduce waste pursuant to ISO 14001.

Annual Report 2008 19In the remaining two years of the second medium-term management plan, Shionogi will aggressively utilize the investments it has made to quickly achieve further quality improvements and cost reductions. Shionogi will also build facilities to accommodate new products andincreased overseas sales of Finibax \u00ae, and take other steps to upgrade its infrastructure in prepa- ration for its next leap forward. These changes and advances in the Manufacturing Division areclearly contributing to the Company's progress and, by extension, to global healthcare. Ongoing Development and Utilization of Manufacturing Technology Capabilities as a Core Competency Under the second medium-term management plan, Shionogi conducts contract man- ufacturing to attain a high level of quality and manufacturing technology capabilities; maintain and improve its manufacturing technologies; and establish a system that enablesplants to operate as self-sustaining enterprises. Shionogi works together with consolidatedsubsidiaries Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Nichia Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. andShionogi Analysis Center Co. Ltd., to provide integrated contract manufacturing services. For manufacturing of antibiotics, Shionogi offers expertise developed over many years, skilled technicians, and a manufacturing system that can handle requests on a globalbasis. These advantages have led to contract manufacturing orders from companies inJapan and overseas, which is contributing to achievement of the second medium-termmanagement plan. In addition, Shionogi also supports overall healthcare by actively providing its manu- facturing technologies. For example, Shionogi has developed a highly convenient orallydisintegrating tablet, a chewable soft-capsule that can be taken without water, and coat-ing technology that uses polyvinyl acetate copolymer to prevent oxygen permeation. Shionogi will expand its contract manufacturing business by proposing solutions that take advantage of its production technologies. By effectively utilizing, maintaining anddeveloping its production technology and facilities, Shionogi will build a strong groupwith even higher competitiveness in terms of quality, technology and cost. We are confi-dent that the measures we are taking, including strengthening product research anddevelopment and product life cycle management functions, will benefit our customersand all stakeholders, as well as Shionogi. A Manufacturing System that Support Overseas Business Finibax\u00aeis now available in overseas markets through licensee Johnson & Johnson, with the start of shipments to the United States in 2007. To support the increase in over-seas sales of Finibax \u00ae, the Manufacturing Division is upgrading its overseas product supply structure centered on the Kanegasaki Plant. Shionogi also plans to quickly strengthen itsglobal CMC development structure to accommodate future overseas sales of new drugs. Shionogi has already begun procurement of raw materials in China, India and other Asian countries to decrease cost of sales, and will take further steps to strengthen over-seas procurement of inexpensive, high-quality raw materials and intermediates to raise itsinternational cost competitiveness.Current Progress, Long-Term Potential New solid dosage facility at the Settsu Plant (scheduled for completion in November 2008) Facility for manufacturing APIs for clinical trials at the Kuise Site (in full operation since November 2007) Ryuichi Kume, Ph.D. Executive Officer, Executive General Manager, Manufacturing Division 20Toward Achievement of the Second Medium-Term Management Plan In sales and marketing , we have set the g oal of stren gthening the d omestic sales force based on a plan to launch 10 new pro ducts d uring the second med ium-term manag ement plan period .

Thus, in fiscal 2005 an d 2006, the d ecrease in sales of existin g prod ucts overshad owed the g rowth of new prod ucts. In view of this situation, at the en d of fiscal 2006 we und ertook a d rastic reassessment of our sales and marketing measures d uring the previous two years. In fiscal 2007, we moved to cond uct sales activities focuse d on new prod ucts throug h measures such as concentrating sales and marketing resources on strate gic prod ucts and introd ucing a new method for evaluatin g MRs. The result was g rowth in sales of new prescription drugs, par- ticularly Crestor\u00ae. In fiscal 2007, our domestic prescription d rug sales increased 2.1 percent year on year, reversin g an eig ht-year d ecline. In fiscal 2008 , in addition to new pro ducts alread y on a g rowth track, we plan to launch three more prod ucts: Ir betan\u00ae, fib rosis treatment pirfeni done.

Consequently, concern in Japan a bout lifestyle d iseases is expected to continue rising . In these cir- cumstances, Shiono gi will work to stead ily increase the presence of Crestor\u00aeas an effective, safe an d economical statin. Shionogi's sales in Japan increased year on year for the first time in eight years amid tough con- ditions in the domestic pharmaceutical market. This demonstrates that our measures to strengthen domestic sales and marketing, one of the objectives of the second medium-term managementplan, are steadily producing results. We will continue to strengthen our sales force by concentrat-ing resources on new products, and will focus on achieving sales and marketing plans.

Annual Report 2008 21Takuo Fukuda Executive Officer, Executive General Manager, Human Health Care Division Irbetan\u00ae(Antihypertensive) Launched July 2008 A long -acting angiotensin II receptor anta gonist, Irb etan\u00ae has a stab le hypotensive effect lastin g 24 hours on mild to severe hypertension. In lar ge-scale clinical trials overseas, the drug has proven to have a hig h renoprotective effect. It is alread y approve d in 109 countries an d marketed in 86 coun- tries. The Japanese market for an giotensin II receptor anta go- nists is approximately \u00a5500 billion (b ased on 2007 NHI d rug prices). By participatin g in this market, Shiono gi aims to estab - lish a presence in the car diovascular/lipid metab olism area. Differin\u00aeGel 0.1% (Topical treatment for acne vulgaris) Manufacturing and marketing approval received July 2008 Differin\u00aeGel 0.1% is a topical treatment for acne vul garis that contains the active in gredient Ad apalene, a naphthoic acid derivative that has retinoi d-like activity. It has a mecha- nism of action that re duces acne b y suppressing cornification. Differin\u00aeGel 0.1%, the first topical preparation for acne vul- garis approve d for manufacturin g and marketin g in Japan, is expecte d to contrib ute to treatment an d improve the quality of life for acne patients. Pirfenidone (Treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis affects an estimate d 3 to 5 of every 100,000 people in Japan, but patients have a poor pro g- nosis marke d primarily b y chronic an d prog ressive fib rosis of the lung s. There are currently no effective me dications. Shionog i is working to b ring this d rug to market as early as possib le to fulfill the expectations of the patients sufferin g from this d isease, their families an d healthcare provi ders. New Products Launched or Scheduled for Launch in Fiscal 2008 Finibax\u00ae(Carb apen em an tibiotic) Launched Septemb er Gram-neg ative aerob bacteria and anaero bic bacteria. Moreover, because it exhi bits is a hi ghly useful d rug for treating mod erate to serious infections. We believe the properties of Finib ax\u00aeare fully d emonstrated in treating serious infectious d iseases, and aim to increase its evaluation not only from the perspective of efficacy, but also b ased on its specific properties that prevent Pseud omonas aerug inosa from b ecoming resistant, which is a concern when treating serious infectious d iseases. In the United States, this d rug was launched by Johnson & Johnson in 2007, and has b een listed in the Sanford Guid e to Antimicrob ial Therapy b ased on various evi dence. Therefore, it is expecte d to gain increasing domestic and international reco gnition as the reference drug for injectab le car- bapenems. Avelox\u00ae(New qui nolone antibiotic) Launched Decemb er 2005 As a respiratory quinolone, Avelox\u00aeexhib its excellent antib acterial activity ag ainst all the major bacteria that cause respiratory tract infections, an d is particularly useful in treatin g lower respiratory tract infections. This drug also contrib utes to lowerin g healthcare costs by shortenin g the treatment period , and thus has very hi gh growth potential. Shiono gi aims to increase sales by solid ifying the position of Avelox\u00aeas a first-choice d rug for treating lower respiratory tract infections. Finibax\u00ae Avelox\u00ae 22Intellectual Property Life Cycle Management and Response to Patent Disputes Patents have a limite d duration, and generic prod- ucts are sold after the substance patent expires. However, Shiono gi extends the life cycle of drugs after they are launche d by actively acquiring patents for manu- facturing methods, intermediates, methods of use, for-mulations, crystalline forms an d other relate d items. In addition to strengthening protection of its original prod-ucts, Shionogi also takes advantage of the patent exten-sion systems in various countries to maximize patent pro-tection periods. In the United States, generic drug applications can be filed even during the effective patent perio d. Consequently, applications have been filed to manufac- ture generic versions of hyperlipidemia treatmentCrestor \u00ae. Shionogi and its licensee AstraZeneca plc have worked closely and filed patent infringement suitsagainst the generic drug companies, and will take allpossible measures to continue to protect revenues by leveraging the patents on Crestor \u00ae. New drug development requires a huge commit- ment of financial resources, but is characterize d by a very low success rate. This means that companies must relyon products on the market to recover their total R&Dinvestment and increase profits. Protection of patentstherefore is critical to maintain adequate incentives forresearch and development. Moreover, there are fewerpatents in the pharmaceutical in dustry than in other industries, so the value of a sin gle patent is extremely high. Consequently, intellectual property can determine a company's competitiveness. Shiono gi recognizes that an intellectual property strate gy linked to R&D strate gy is a source of corporate growth and income, and is con- ducting its intellectual property activities globally. Patent Filing Strategy Shionogi conducts its drug discovery activities after accurately confirmin g other companies ' patents related to promising drug discovery targets selected in theresearch process, an d employs a patent filing strategy that emphasizes efficient acquisition of broad and strong substance patents for the novel compoun ds it discovers. Focusing on the future, Shionogi also continues workingto reserve suitable patent rights for drug discovery tar-gets and basic search technolo gies relating to gene, pro- tein and screening methods. In fiscal 2007, Shiono gi filed approximately 100 patent applications, of which a bout 40 percent were file d overseas. Patent Portfolio Management and Royalty Income from Patent Licensing Shionogi periodically reviews its patent portfolio to determine whether or not unuse d patents shoul d be maintained, taking cost into account. As of March 31, 2008, Shionogi held approximately 230 patents in Japanand about 140 patent families (subject matter claimed,patents registered) overseas. Royalty income from patent licensin g in fiscal 2007 was approximately \u00a532.0 billion, a substantial increasefrom \u00a521.3 billion in fiscal 2006. 07 06 05 04 03 (FY)0102040 (Billions of yen) 30Royalty Income from Patent Licensing 9.821.332.0 6.1 1.2 Shionogi's CSR Activities Quality Assurance and High-Quality Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Responses to Inquiries at the Drug Information Center Initiatives to Spread Cancer Pain TreatmentRelations with Annual Report 2008 23 24Shionogi' s CSR Activities Mission (Purpose) Shionogi's mission and value to society Vision (Goals) What the Company must be and achieve in ord er to accomplish its mission Values (Standards of Conduct) How employees must cond uct themselves in ord er to realize the Company vision 5 Values Mi i Shionogi's Action Guidelines: An easy-to-understand framework for implementing the Company Policy of Shionogi through daily activities, comprising the Company's purpose (mission), goals (vision) and standards of conduct (values) Shionogi understands that the only way to gain the trust of society is to steadily provide original medicines in a proper manner to the maximum number of people.To do this, employees must build relationships of mutual trust both inside and outside the Company.\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001Shionogi understands that its laboratories, plants and the places where it sells are a focus of expertise and fact, and that the Company's activities at these sites reflect whether the Company's efforts are benefiting patients, their families and healthcare professionals.For these reasons, Shionogi places a priority on information from these sites, and uses such information as a basis for action. \u0001 \u0001Shionogi understands that respect for individuals and the recognition of diversity result in a higher level of creative value, and that this allows the Company to provide patients, their families and healthcare workers with greater value.For this reason, Shionogi's employees maintain maximum respect for each other and everyone they deal with. \u0001 \u0001Shionogi understands that maintaining the highest level of professionalism in attitude and conduct is crucial for ensuring that it provides the best medicines to patients and healthcare professionals.For this reason, Shionogi's employees work steadily, overcoming major challenges with a positive mindset and accomplishing the goals they have set in order to achieve the highest level of competence in every field. \u0001 \u0001Shionogi understands that the greatest joy comes from bringing joy to patients, their families and healthcare professionals by relieving their suffering and concerns.For this reason, the Company places the highest priority on relationships with these people, and takes meticulous care to meet their demands. ple. of 5 Value s 5 s Customer FocusTrust On-Site Orientation Respect for the IndividualProfessionalism The Company Policy of Shionogi (Corporate Philosophy): A statement of the Company's aims, and its enduring philosophy and valuesShionogi's Company Policy on CSR Activities Shionog i's purpose, as expresse d in the b eginning of the Company Policy, is \"to strive constantly to provi de med icine of the b est possib le kind essential for protection of the health of the people.\" This en during and unwavering corporate phi- losophy is a statement of our vision an d value to society.

As a compa- ny that hand les prod ucts related to people 's lives and health, we consid er it our corporate social responsi bility (CSR) to d eliv- er a sta ble supply of these pro ducts to healthcare provi ders and patients, an d to ensure that they use them properly with a sense of security backed by science. We ensure the relia bility of the pharmaceuticals we manu- facture and sell with a quality assurance structure based on the three manufacturin g and marketin g roles stipulated in the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law. In fiscal 2007, there were no pro duct recalls d ue to the development of serious health damag e, quality d efects or other such reasons as a result of Shiono gi's promotion of proper use of its prod ucts and strict quality assurance activities. Owin g to proper manufacturin g and sales mana gement, there were also no d eficiencies in stab le supply, no violations of the Pharmaceuticals Affairs Law or other re gulations, and no com- pliance violations. Due to proper quality assurance activities no situations arose that coul d disrupt Shiono gi's manufacturin g and marketing operations. These results demonstrate that Shionog i's quality assurance structure functione d smoothly. They were also ma de possib le because all Shionog i employees understood the Company' s basic policy of \"provid ing med icine of the b est possib le kind essential for protection of the health of the people,\" an d acted appropriately. With the globalization of the pharmaceutical in dustry, over- seas manufacturin g and sales are rapid ly expand ing. In tand em with this tren d, Shionog i is workin g to ensure that people around the world can use its pro ducts secure in the knowle dge that they are safe and effective. Approaches to High-Quality Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Throug hout its long history, Shionog i has strictly ad hered to its Company Policy an d continues to d iligently pursue quality improvements. In the sequence of pharmaceutical development, from d rug discovery to clinical trial d rug manufacturing to commercial pro duction, we use both tang ible and intang ible measures b acked by science to achieve consistent quality assurance. We also actively a dopt the latest technolo gies, such as a process analytical technolo gy (PAT) system for designing, analyzing and controlling manufacturin g processes, and have installed state-of-the-art inspection equipment. However, exhaustive operatin g proced ures and the latest equipment alone are not enou gh to create the hi ghest-quality pharmaceuticals. As manufacturers, we must have a deep understand ing of the properties of each drug and have the commitment to provi de med icines of the hig hest possib le quality to patients. As part of this commitment, Shiono gi is continuously raising its d evelopment, design and manufacturin g capab ilities to improve its quality assurance system in or der to g uarantee high quality. Technolo gy transfer is one of our means to improve quality. Shionog i thinks that technolog ies should not b e transferred as they are b etween ind ividuals. They should be continuously improve d and transferred after some improvement. For exam- ple, in the ed ucation and training of young er scientists b y senior experts, new technolo gies such as pow der vial inspection are used to enhance our quality assurance level. Thus Shiono gi is trying to improve its workin g environment an d organization to enab le the incorporation of new technolo gies in its prod ucts.

Accord ing to research pu blished in 2003 by the Ministry of Health, La bour and Welfare, only aroun d 40 percent of cancer patients were free of pain. As a result of these con ditions, the g overnment of Japan bolstered cancer treatment measures with the enforcement of the Basic Law Concernin g Cancer Countermeasures in April 2007. The g overnment increase d opportunities for spread ing cancer pain treatment by making the spread of palliative cancer care and pain treatment a priority of the law. Shionogi's Initiatives Shionog i launched MS Contin\u00aein 198 9, OxyContin\u00aeTablets in 2003 and OxiNorm\u00aepowd er in 2007. Throu gh the provision of information on these narcotic me dicines to healthcare pro- fessionals, the Company has actively disseminated information on WHO pain relief metho ds. Further, in conjunction with the enforcement of the Basic Law Concernin g Cancer Countermeasures, Shiono gi esta b- lished the Cancer Pain Mana gement Business Development Department to promote initiatives that increase acceptance ofcancer pain treatment by healthcare professionals an d the g en- eral pub lic. Specific ed ucational initiatives includ e television commer- cials an d pub lic lectures that wid ely convey the importance of cancer pain treatment.

We intend to contribute as much as possible to freeing patients from pain and impr oving their quality of life. 28Human Resource Development People are Shionog i's most important resource. The Company d oes its utmost to create an envi-ronment in which employ-ees can proactivelyimprove and exercise their skills. Fair and Equitable Personnel Evaluations Shionog i has strictly alig ned Company targ ets with ind i- vidual employee targ ets, and has b uilt a targ et manag ement system that emphasizes Plan, Do, Check, Act mana gement. We b elieve that by accurately evaluatin g the ab ilities employees display, the roles they play an d the results they achieve in their areas of responsi bility, we can assi gn them appropriately, placin g the rig ht people in the ri ght job s. This allows us to make the most of their am bitions and abilities. For this reason, Shiono gi is increasing the transparency of the evaluation framework throu gh the creation an d disclosure of evaluation stan dards to employees, as well as by maintaining evaluation manuals an d provid ing evaluation trainin g. In addition, the Company is workin g to increase employee con- fidence in the application of the evaluation framework by gathering feedback on the results. Labor-Management Relations Shionog i has conclud ed a lab or ag reement with the Shionog i Pharmaceuticals Lab or Union, of which its employ- ees are mem bers, in ord er to further improve their workin g cond itions and lifestyles. The Company an d the Union have created various venues for dialog ue in ord er to estab lish sound labor-manag ement relations b ased on mutual und er- stand ing and trust. The Company provi des detailed explana- tions re garding Shionog i's Company Policy an d business plans at the Mana gement Conference, an d hold s discussions on a variety of la bor-manag ement topics throu gh bodies includ ing the Working Hours Red uction Review Meetin g, the Welfare Pro gram Review Meetin g and the Gend er Cooperation Review Meetin g. We will continue to d eepen understand ing between lab or and manag ement while work- ing to improve the work environment an d implement various measures. Occupational Safety and Health In protecting people' s health, Shionog i recog nizes the primary importance of the safety an d health of its employees, which the Company ensures thou gh a variety of initiatives centered on the safety an d health committees of each work- place. To ensure safety, because many chemicals are use d at its research facilities an d factories, the Company strictly enforces appropriate han dling and storag e manag ement, and is streng thening the internal check system. In a ddition, to prevent occupational injury or illness, Shiono gi reg ularly con- ducts rig orous safety inspections, promptly a ddresses any prob lems id entified , and works to raise employee safety awareness.

Employment of Persons with Disabilities To promote normalization, Shiono gi has b een making ongoing efforts to hire persons with disabilities. In fiscal 2007, Shionog i's employment rate for persons with disabilities was 2.29 percent, far excee ding the leg ally mand ated employ- ment rate of 1.8 percent. In 2003, Shiono gi received recog ni- tion from the Osaka Employment Development Associationas a d isting uished employer. This association also presents a disabled Shionog i employee with a lon gtime service awar d every year, reflectin g the Company' s hig h retention rate for persons with disabilities. Rights Initiatives In the process of research an d development for new drugs, the most a dvanced new technolog ies, animal experi- ments an d other measures such as human g enome and applied genetic research are use d. Ultimately, clinical trials using patients are necessary to conclusively esta blish a d rug's efficacy and safety. Consid ering the rig hts of ind ividuals who sub mit g enetic information, blood and tissue for or participate in clinical trials, in 2001 Shiono gi estab lished the Ethics Committee for Human Tissue an d Genetic Research, inclu ding non- Company physicians and lawyers, and cond ucts d rug devel- opment with full ethical consi deration of matters inclu ding informed consent and privacy protection. Shiono gi has clearly set out its stance on employee ri ghts in the \"Con duct at Shiono gi\" the Shiono gi Charter of Cond uct, statin g that \"Shionog i respects the ri ghts and individuality of its employees an d works to ensure theircomfort and fulfillment.\" In line with this, Shiono gi has mented estab lished a consul- tation service to ensure that there is no discrimination either insid e or outsid e the Company on the g round s of race, nationality, ori gin, relig ion, creed , beliefs, g ender, ag e, ed u- cation, d isability, illness or other factors, nor any harassment, sexual or otherwise.

Other activi- ties include q ualification training of internal auditors to audit operation of the environmental mana gement system and education to raise their skill level. In addition, Shiono gi sets procedures and conducts annual drills for responding to events such as natural disasters, fires, chemical leaks and other emer gencies, and is revising procedures and emerg ency eq uipment and materials. In fiscal 2007, the Kane gasaki Plant invited a memb er of the Iwate Prefecture Committee to Promote Anti-Glob al Warming Activities to g ive a lecture on \"Glob al Warming and What We Should Do A bout It,\" and carried out comprehensive disaster drills to gether with firefig hters. The Fukuoka branch office creat- ed posters to call for full employee participation in initiatives includin g recycling copy paper and ending vehicle idling during long stops. Further, our internal auditor qualification trainin g resulted in 25 new auditors.Environmental Management System Shionogi promotes ongoing environmental activities, and has obtained ISO 14001 certification of the envi- ronmental management system in its manufacturing and R&D operations, which have a large environmental impact, and at domestic manufacturing subsidiaries. The Shionogi Group, including branch offices and over-seas subsidiaries, is taking action to achieve the targets of the Phase 3 Shionogi Group EnvironmentalProtection Plan, and making progress in monitoring and reducing the environmental load. Shionog i conducts environmental audits of b usiness sites and Group companies to verify that they are complyin g with envi- ronmental laws and reg ulations, properly manag ing environmental risks and making continual improvements to their mana ge- ment systems. In fiscal 2007, Shionog i conducted environmental audits of Nichia Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Corrective measures have been taken for inadeq uacies including revisions to the environmental aspect sig nificance assess- ment system and environmental documents at Nichia Pharmaceutical Industries and environmental aspects for operations that indirectly impact the environment and clarification of environmental reg ulation compliance items at Bushu Pharmaceuticals. Posters promotin g envi- ronmental initiatives (Fukuoka branch office) ISO 14001 Environmental Audits Environmental Education and Training Six Shionog i sites and two on-site sub sidiaries involved in R&D and manufacturing obtained ISO 14001 certification, an international environmental mana gement standard, to gether in March 2002. The Company's domestic manufacturin g subsidiaries also ob tained certification at ab out the same time. These sites are audited b y an external organization each year to verify the effectiveness of their mana gement systems. Internal Audits Under ISO 14001, Shiono gi performs internal aud its to ensure that the environmental mana gement system is operatin g sound ly and to improve the system. The internal aud it for fiscal 2007 pointe d out one serious d eficiency, as well as such minor d eficiencies as ina dequacy in environmental aspect evaluation and delay in Environmental Committee reporting. The serious deficiency was due to inadequacies in areas inclu ding communication and document management , and measures were taken to correct these ina dequacies. Serious deficiencies: Major nonconformance, unab le to recommend registration Medium deficiencies: Nonconformance of a medium degree, recommend regis- tration after correction is confirmed Minor deficiencies: Deficiencies of a minor degree, will confirm correction in next audit Comments: Items observed to be effective in improvement of environ- mental management systemExternal Audits In fiscal 2007, Japan Chemical Quality Assurance Lt d. (JCQA) conducted audits of Shionogi from January 1- February 7, 2008, Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd. from Septemb er 11-14, 2007, and Nichia Pharmaceutical In dustries Ltd . from Septemb er 27- 28 , 2007. The aud its were for the renewal of certification an d occur every three years, and all companies were recertified. Shionogi: The aud it found the med ium deficiency that poisonous waste was not indicated or locked away. It also pointed out ina dequacies in compliance eval- uation procedures and recordkeeping, providing information to waste management companies and other areas. Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd.: The audit pointed out that the updated envi- ronmental manual \"Response in Case of Fire\" was stored together with its oldversion, and that the two versions were not easily distinguishable. Nichia Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.: The audit pointed out that there were no revisions to the register of si gnificant environmental aspects following revisions to environmental aspect evaluation, an d that the measurement items of industrial wastewater did not meet voluntarily esta blished standards.

Shionogi maintains communication with local communities throu gh partici- pation in cleanup activities around each site and environment related associa- tions, as well as conducting factory tours and other activities. We explain upcomin g construction and demolition work to the heads of local residents' associations, school principals and other concerned parties in advance. In fiscal 2007, the Kanegasaki Plant co-sponsored Iwate Prefecture's CO 2 Diet Point program.Shionog i issued an environmental report on its initia- tives, both in printed form and on the We b, from 2000 to 2006 to meet its social responsi bility and to provide infor- mation to stakeholders. We have issued an En glish version since 2002, and have ob tained a third-party evaluation since 2003 to enhance the reliab ility and transparency of the environmental report. From 2007, we have pub lished the environmental report as a section of the Annual Report. Information Disclosure Interaction with Local Communities Green PurchasingEnvironment-related laws and re gulations cover a wide range of issues, including atmospheric pollution, water pollution and chemical substance controls. Shionogi has established procedures for complying with each regulation, and uses compli- ance evaluation sheets once a year to confirm that standards, notifications and controls are being operated properly accord- ing to the relevant regulations. In addition, Shionogi operates according to voluntarily established standards for wastewaterand other emissions that are stricter than the legal requirements. Shionog i promotes g reen purchasin g throug h measures such as purchasing raw materials that have a low environmental impact and doin g business with other com- panies that are making environmental preservation efforts. Specifically, Shiono gi uses a Product Evaluation List for purchases and an Environmental Manag ement Evaluation List to assess the environmental load of the products we purchase and the environmental preservation efforts of suppliers. In fiscal 2007, Shionog i conducted q uestionnaire surveys of its 108 main sup- plying manufacturers. $MFBOVQ\u0001BDUJWJUJFT\u0001 ,VJTF\u00014JUF \u0001 Environmental Reports (Fiscal 2000-2007) In complaints re garding the environment, in fiscal 2007, noise from demolition at the Settsu Plant generated one complaint.

Fiscal 2007 Results Fiscal 2008 Targets Evaluati on 38Results of Activities Prevention of Illegal Dumping To prevent illeg al dumping , when selectin g contractors for waste treatment and transport ,Shionogi uses an evaluation sheet to verify that they have a current b usiness license an d check the cond ition of their treatment facilities and operations, d ocument manag ement and other matters. We consid er the results in making the contracting decision. In addition to appropriately mana ging contracts, licenses, an d manifests, we do on-site verifications of waste treatment contractors at least once a year. Effective Use of Resources The Developmental Research Lab oratories has dramatically re duced new purchases of cool boxes used in storage and delivery of samples by promoting their reuse. The Aburahi Laboratories chippe d the cuttings and wood generated in greenery maintenance, and buried them in weed control areas, which si g- nificantly reduced weeding work. At distribution centers, Shionogi has been promoting reuse with mea- sures including using old newspapers as cushioning materials and repeat- edly reusing packaging boxes for product transport. The Kanegasaki Plant achieved cost reductions and higher productivity by improving processes based on knowledge of Material Flow Cost Accountin g. Recycling As much as possib le, Shionog i recovers, puri- fies and solvents d in manufac- turing , and contracts with outsi de companies that carry out heat recovery and recycling of waste sol- vents that cannot be reused. We also separate andcollect metals and paper for recycling . In fiscal 2007, we promoted recycling of inorganic sludge atthe Kanegasaki Plant. Zero Emissions We are working to red uce waste sent d irectly to land fills, total elimination of which we define as zero emissions. In fiscal 2007, we were unab le to achieve zero emissions because Nichia Pharmaceutical Ind ustries emitted 0.3 tons of materials includ ing activate d charcoal d ue to an error in waste disposal proced ures, and the Nag oya branch office emitted 1.1 tons of general waste due to chan ges in dispos- al method s with its relocation to a lease d building. However, we continue to promotezero emis-sions.Amount of Waste Generated The main wastes includ ed waste oil g enerated in the manufac- turing process, sludge generated in wastewater treatment an d plastics used in prod uct containers. Since fiscal 2005, the amount of waste g enerated has b een on an upward trend due to increased prod uction volume, an increase in research and devel- opment and other factors. Therefore, we have promoted recycling . In addition, at the Developmental Research La boratories an d Kuise Site staff cafeterias, we intro duced disposal equipment for left- overs and are composting waste.Limiting generation of waste and promotin g reuse and recycling are essential in forming an environment-oriented soci- ety. In Japan, the landfill crunch and the increase in ille gal dumping of waste have become issues of concern. The Shiono gi Group has also set waste reduction tar gets in the Phase 3 Shiono gi Group Environmental Protection Plan. Waste Generated (Tons) (FY)06,000 4,000 2,0008,00010,000 00 90 01 100 502002501,000 00 90 01 02 06 03 02 03 04 SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 39Cafeterias Shionog i and its domestic Group companies use musenmai , a type of rice that requires no washing , at all b usiness sites and dormitories with facilities for provi ding meals, so that we d o not release rice-rinsin g water, which is linke d to pollution of water environments. In a ddition, not washing rice red uces our water consumption by 1,700 cub ic meters per year. Note: The residue that is removed when rice is washed contains phosphorus and nitrog en, which cause red tide, water bloom and other pro blems. Low-Emission VehiclesGreen Purchasing In purchasing supplies, Shiono gi promotes the purchase and use of products with as little environmental impact as pos- sible. For office supplies, we make efforts to purchase environ-ment-friend ly prod ucts bearing the Eco Mark, Green Mark or similar labels. i has introd uced an intranet-b ased purchasing sys- tem that makes g reen purchasing easier b y displaying a mark that allows users to i dentify eco-friend ly prod ucts when ord ering . In fiscal 2007, the Shiono gi Group's green purchasing rate increased to 77 percent according to the purchase amount ofoffice supplies, partly because the numb er of prod ucts reg is- tered as environment-friendly increase d. Copy Paper and Printing Paper Reducing use of copy paper and printing paper is included as a targ et in the Phase 3 Shionog i Group Environmental Protection Plan to red uce the amount of paper use d. In April 2006, Shiono gi made simultaneous renewals of personal com- puters and printers throug hout the Company. As a result, we are red ucing the amount of copy paper an d printing paper used by initiatives includ ing printing double-sid ed or multiple pages per sheet, shifting to paperless faxing, increasing the use of LCD projectors by carrying personal computers to meetings,and recommend ing document manag ement in electronic media using scanners. In fiscal 2007, the amount of paper usedwas largely unchanged from fiscal 2006.

We will continue to promote the intro duction of low- emission vehicles an d vehicles with hi gh fuel efficiency. 40Environmental EfficiencyCogeneration Systems A cog eneration system is a system in which two or more types of energ y are ob tained simultaneously from a sing le fuel source. Such systems use eng ines or tur bines to g enerate electricity while recoverin g waste heat from the generation process for air cond ition- ing and water heatin g (comb ined heat and power supply), and are installed at the Settsu Plant and Kaneg asaki Plant. Cog eneration allows efficient use of input ener gy - as much as 65-8 0 percent - thus achieving significant energ y saving s.Glob al warming is an international environmental issue, and the Law Concernin g the Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global Warmin g, the Revised Law Concernin g the Rational Use of Ener gy and other re gulations concernin g greenhouse gases have been streng thened. Shionog i has b een aggressively working on energ y conservation since 1995 in the Manufacturin g Division, where a large amount of energy was used. We consider global warming to be an important issue for Group companies as well, and are working to curb greenhouse gas emissions through means including upgrading lighting e quipment, air conditioning systems and manufacturin g equipment so that they use less ener gy and changing their operating methods. In fiscal 2007, we continued to take systematic steps includin g renewing transformers, elevator hoists, air compressors, small- scale once-through boilers and other e quipment to make them more energy efficient, and installin g lights that automatically turn themselves off. However, the volume of g reenhouse gas emissions increased because of increased manufacturin g and research and development activities. We will continue to review e quipment operating methods and running times, and will work to curb output of g reenhouse gases and improve our environmentalefficiency by renewing equipment with high energy efficiency specifi-cations, such as electrical sub sta- tion eq uipment, refrig erators and electric motors for pumps.Prevention of Global Warming (Tons-CO 2) (FY)CO2 and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions 080,000100,000120,000Domestic subsidiariesOverseas subsidiary Shionogi Note: From fiscal 2005, figures for all greenhouse gas emissions are included on a Group-wide basis. From fiscal 2006, the Tokyo branch office expanded the scope of a way to comfortab ly limit g reenhouse gas emissions b y encourag ing employees to work with- out neckties and business jackets, allowing adjustment of office air cond itioning temperatures. Shionog i has carrie d out this prog ram since fiscal 2005, and extend ed its perio d of implementation in fiscal 2007 throug hout the Company d ue to hig h temperatures nationwid e. \"CO 2Reduction / Light Down Campaign\" The Ministry of the Environment a dvocates the \"CO 2Reduction/Light Down Campaign,\" which calls for lighting facilities and house- hold electricity to be turned off as a measure to prevent global warming. Shionogi has switched off advertising lights and other lights at the Settsu Plant, Kanegasaki Plant, Shiono gi Research Laboratories and Developmental Research Laboratories. After participatin g in this campaign in fiscal 2005, Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has continued to keep facility li ghts off at night. Environmental efficiency (net sales/ greenhouse gas emis- sions), which is based on greenhouse gas emissions and net sales, currently shows little chan ge, but Shionog i will work to improve environmental efficiency throu gh efficient business activities. Note: Environmental efficiency is calculated as net sales divided by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, higher numbers indicate more environment-friendly business activities. (FY)Environmental Efficiency Index (Index) Note: For fiscal years prior to fiscal 2005, only figures for the CO 2 emissions of Shionogi & Co.'s sites are used. From fiscal 2005, figures for all greenhouse gases are included on a Group-wide basis.Once-throug h boiler (Ab urahi Lab oratories) SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 41Environmental Emission Volume Substances Reported under the PRTR Law (kg, mg-TEQ for dioxins)Some chemical substances have an impact on human health, ecosystems and the global environment. Proper manage- ment of chemical su bstances is carried out internationally, and the pharmaceutical industry is also implementing voluntary measures such as surveying the amount of chemical substances used and reducing atmospheric emissions. The Shiono gi Group properly mana ges polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances, includin g con- trolling emissions of chemical substances into the atmosphere and water. In addition, we have a rea gent control system in place for appropriate inventory and access controls for chemicals used in research and development.Chemical Substance Control Control of Atmospheric EmissionsSince 1996, Shionogi has controlled its emissions of dichloromethane and chloroform as a measure to reduce hazardous air pollutants. At the Kanegasaki Plant, we installed two recovery units that substantially reduced atmos- pheric emissions of dichloromethane. We subsequently formed a project team to consider measures for continuin g reductions. Although we were unable to achieve our initial tar gets for fiscal 2007 due to increased manufacturing activity, we continue to work on controllin g atmospheric emissions. We have dramatically reduced emissions of chloroform since 2000 by discontinuing the manufacture of prod- ucts that use it. Shionogi files reports un der the PRTR (Pollutant Release and Transfer Register) Law, a re gulation that requires companies to measure, compile an d announce data on their sources of hazardous chemicals and how much of these chemicals were released into the environment. Althou gh the amount of chemical and hazardous su bstances we use has trended upward with increased manufacturing volumes, we are taking steps to properly manage the amount of such chemicals we purchase and curb their release into the environment.

These assessments are performed during the development of manufacturin g and testing methods for pharmaceuticals and products under development, and at the e quipment design stage. In addition, Shionogi selects efficient production processes to control the amount of waste generated, and holds in-house lectures on designing environment-friendly experimental methods to raiseawareness of Green Chemistry. Product Life Cycle Assessment Chemical Process Safety EvaluationShionogi also must consider the environmental load of the products it manufactures after they are sold. We are consider- ing the material quality and form of product containers and packa ging, and taking measures for improvement. Measures for Product Packaging Change of Material Quality From PVC to polypropylene (avoiding chlorinated materials that could generate dioxins when inadequately incinerated) From plastic trays to paper trays (resource conservation) Change of Form From polyethylene bottles to aluminum pouches (resource conservation) From boxes to bundling with bands (resource conservation)Recycling of Product Packaging In accordance with the Law for Promotion of Sorte d Collection and Recycling of Containers and Packaging, some of the containers and packaging used for theproducts that Shionogi sells are recycled. Planned Recycling Consignment Costs: \u00a522,165 thousandControl of Atmospheric, Wastewater and Soil PollutantsCFCs Specified chlorofluorocarb ons (CFCs) are restricted internationally as sub stances hazar dous to the ozone layer. Shionog i has a long -term renewal plan for specified CFC equipment, and is moving toward its targ et of completely eliminatin g equipment hold ing more than 20kg of specifie d CFCs by fiscal 2010. Shiono gi renewed one specified CFC equipment unit at the Settsu Plant in fiscal 2007 and plans to renew three units at the Kuise Site in fiscal 200 8. In addition, sub sidiary Shionog i Eng ineering Service Co., Ltd . is reg istered as a CFC recovery company, an d properly treats an d disposes of CFCs. Dioxins The Shionog i Group operates one waste incinerator. The incinerator is properly mana ged and the level of dioxins is period ically measure d and reported to the g overnment. All measured values are below the re gulation levels. PCBs PCB (polychlorinate d biphenyl) is easily concentrate d in org anisms in the food chain, and is a g lobal pollution threat because it d oes not read ily break down in the environment. In the past, PCB was used in items such as capacitors, transistors and fluorescent lig ht ballasts, and regulations have b een estab lished for proper storag e and treatment of these items when they are discarded. Shionog i assig ns ad ministrators to properly manag e the volume of PCB waste, keeps it in locked stora ge and perio dically reports to the government. In a ddition, Shiono gi checks for the presence of PCBs d uring equipment renewals and other times and properly manag es PCB waste when it is present.Shionog i is red ucing its emissions of exhaust gases containin g nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxid es (SOx), which cause photochemical smo g and acid rain. Measures includ e properly managing the daily operation of b oilers and diesel engines an d selecting sulfur-free fuels. Shionogi complies with relate d regulations and agreements for these sub stances. Shionog i has set voluntary benchmark levels for water pollutants that are stricter than the reg ulations and takes period ic measurements to prevent water pollutantsfrom flowing into the sewage system andrivers. At the Kaneg asaki Plant, A burahi Laboratories, Bushu and Nichia Pharmaceutical Ind ustries, waste- water is purifie d in treatment facilities before being discharg ed into natural water- ways. The Kaneg asaki Plant, which hand les large quantities of chemical sub stances, sets voluntary stand ards for soil, and cond ucts period ic measurements.

Annual Report 2008 434DPQF\u0001PG\u0001 $PNQJMBUJPOShionogi has been conducting environmental accounting since 2000 based on guidelines from the Ministry of the Environment. The purpose of environmental accounting is to quantitatively manage environmental activi- ties by recognizing their cost and the effect they achieve. The main environment-related capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 were energy-saving measures including renewal of lighting equipment, transformers, air compressors and other equipment. Environmental mainte-nance and management costs consisted primarily of preservation of greenery, wastewater management andproper waste disposal. Material economic benefits included revenue from the sale of waste fluid and metals atthe Kanegasaki Plant, and more efficient energy use at the Kuise Site and Settsu Plant through measures includ-ing equipment renewals that resulted in cost savings. In environmental preservation effects, the amount ofwaste and greenhouse gases emitted increased because of a new section of the Kuise Site starting operationand an increase in production volume at the Kanegasaki Plant. Compiled in compliance with Environmental Accountin g Guidelines (Fiscal 2005 Edition) issued by the Ministry of the Environment. Period covered: April 1, 2007 to March 31, 200 8 Scope of compilation: Shionogi and its domestic subsidiaries Environmental cost is determined by proportionally dividing the amount used for the purpose of environ- mental preservation. Environmental preservation benefits are shown as the difference compared with the previous fiscal year. Only results that are calculated based on verifia ble grounds (actual results) are presented as the economic benefits of environmental preservation measures.Environmental Accounting Environmental Preservation Costs Type of cost Investments Expenses (thousand yen) (thousand yen) (1) Cost within business area 68,176 833,941 Pollution prevention 9,478 480,116 Global environmental preservation 58,699 33,290 Resource recycling 0 320,535 (2) Upstream & downstream 0 22,165 (3) Management activities 0 559,229 (4) Research & development 0 0 (5) Social contribution activities 0 3,542 (6) Environmental damage0 6 8 Total 68,176 1,418,945Economic Benefits from Environmental Preservation Measures (Actual Effect) Description of economic benefit Amount (thousand yen) Revenue Business revenue from recycling waste 9,364 Expense reduction Reduction of energy and water costs, etc. 23,052 Total 32,415 Energy and Other Resource Input (Amount Used) Input type Unit FY 2006 FY 2007 16,200 15,006 -1,194 Propane tons 16 17 7,961 -707 1 Water intake Thousand m32,178 1,932 -246 Products for Sale (Amount Used) Material Unit FY 2006 FY 2007 YoY change Plastic containers and packa gingtons 987 950 37 Paper containers and packaging tons 621 621 0 Glass bottles tons \u20145 8 \u2014 Details Load from Emissions (Amount Generated) Output type Unit FY 2006 FY 2007 YoY change Greenhouse gas emissions tons -CO 2108,290 109,372 1,082 Environmental emissions of PRTR Class 1 chemical substances tons 111 105 -6 Waste generated tons 6,895 7,509 614 Waste sent directly to landfills tons 01 1 Public sewerage Thousand m3616 515 -102 Natural waterways Thousand m31,371 1,218 -153 NO X tons 185 164 -22 SOX tons 34 30 -4 BOD tons 12 12 0 COD tons 99 0 44Site Reports The Kuise Site is primarily a research base for new d rug research and manufacturin g of drugs for clinical trials.

Purpose of the Evaluation Report As a third party unrelated to Shionog i's business operations, we here by offer our evaluation of the environmental mana gement activ- ities describ ed in the Annual Report prepare d by Shionog i for the purpose of increasing the cred ibility of the part of its environmental reporting. 2. Procedures Followed We interviewe d manag ers at Shionog i's head office to estab lish how environmental performance data was planne d, executed and calculated at Shionog i, and how that d ata is evaluated and used internally, in ord er to perform our evaluation of the contents of the envi- ronmental section of this report. With regard to supporting materials for the disclosed figures, we performed sampling checks based on financial audit methods as necessary to determine whether or not the actual work was con ducted according to the prescribed system. We visited the hea d office and subsidiary Bushu Pharmaceuticals Lt d. 3. Evaluation Fiscal 2007 was a year of business expansion, an d the environmental loa d increased together with an increase in production compared with the precious fiscal year. Althou gh the Shionog i Group sets overall emission volume tar gets, prod uction expansion appears to have mad e attaining the targ ets difficult. However, it has ad opted some emission intensity targ ets and taken other measures for a flex- ible and effective response, and we b elieve the entire Group has a stron g commitment to red ucing environmental load . We hig hly eval- uate Shiono gi's stance in the prod uction and development of pharmaceuticals, inclu ding measures to ensure safe use of prod ucts while simultaneously red ucing waste, and its emb race of environmental safety that exten ds to chemical reactions d uring prod uction. We b elieve that Shionogi's ecological initiatives show one way that pharmaceutical manufacturers can deal with environmental concerns. We found no serious errors in the calculation of environmental performance data within the scope of our samplin g checks. Subsidiary Bushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd. This company conducts contract manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, which is an unusual form of business in Japan. Waste output hasincreased together with increase d order volume. Ener gy consumption and waste output are mana ged on a se gmented basis, and the company is analyzin g the causes of their generation are studying measures for reduction. Although this business model may produce larg e volumes of packag ing materials an d other waste d epend ing on the item ord ered, the company is workin g to re duce its environmental load while maintaining safety and quality through measures including reaching a greements with or dering parties. Going forward , we expect the company to emb race the concepts of material flow cost accounting and take more effective waste red uc- tion measures. This company manufactures an d sells pharmaceuticals for the domestic market in Taiwan. Concern a bout environmental issues is also increasing in Taiwan, and this company con ducts its activities with consid eration for the environment in areas such as waste disposal, wastewater and emissions, while raisin g the efficiency of production processes.Taiwan Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company has adopted a new accounting standard for the presentation of net asse ts in the balance sheet, which reclassifies former shareholders' equity, valuation and translation adjustments, and minority interests as total n et assets. Total net assets for prior years has been calculated in conformity with the Overview of Results During fiscal 2007 , the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 , the operating environment remained challenging for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry. Measures to restrain drug costs werefurther strengthened, including promotion of the use of genericproducts to help restrain rising medical costs and strengtheningof the Diagnosis Related Group/Prospective Payment System(DRG/PPS). In addition, competition in sales and marketing andR&D that includes global corporations intensified further. Under these conditions, the Shionogi Group focused on its core prescription drug business and each division from R&D andmanufacturing to sales and marketing actively worked to achievethe goals of the second medium-term management plancovering the period from April 2005 to March 2010 , which is positioned as the initial stage of the Group 's drive to make a significant leap forward over the long term. In R&D, Shionogireorganized its operations with the goal of continuously creatinginternally discovered drug candidates and developing themglobally. In addition, Shionogi worked to steadily move productsnow under development in the United States to the next stageof development. In manufacturing, Shionogi worked to create aquality and production system that can handle global expansion,and moved to further reduce costs by rethinking procurementand raising productivity. In domestic marketing, Shionogi con-centrated resources on new products, centered on the hyperlipi-demia treatment Crestor \u00ae. Shionogi also established the basis for significant future achievements by strengthening systematicsales activities to counter the trend toward lower prescriptiondrug sales. Net Sales Net sales increased 7.3percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a5214 ,268million. Factors supporting the increase included growth in sales of mainstay prescription drugs such asCrestor \u00aeand cancer pain drugs. In addition, royalty income from industrial property rights increased substantially becauseAstraZeneca plc expanded overseas sales of Crestor \u00ae, and sales increased in the contract manufacturing business, which includessubsidiaries.Gross Profit Cost of sales increased \u00a51,052million compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a568,594million but decreased to 32.0per- cent of net sales from 33.8percent because sales of prescription drugs and royalty income from industrial property rightsincreased. As a result, gross profit increased 10.2percent to \u00a5145 ,674million. Operating Expenses and Operating Income Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 1.9percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a5105 ,275million, but decreased to 49.1percent of net sales from 51.7percent for the previous fiscal year. A primary factor in the increase was higher R&D expenses, which are included in SG&Aexpenses. R&D expenses increased 7.6percent to \u00a540,290million. Operating income increased 40.0percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a540,399million. Increased sales of prescription drugs and royalty income from industrial propertyrights compensated for higher R&D expenses. Management's Discussion and Analysis SHIONOGI & CO., LTD. Annual Report 2008 49Net other expenses totaled \u00a5436 million, compared with net other income of \u00a52,860million for the previous fiscal year. Net inter- est and dividend income increased to \u00a52,309million from \u00a51,707 million for the previous fiscal year. However, gain on exchange of investments in securities decreased \u00a51,722million from the previ- ous fiscal year, and loss on disposal of inventories increased \u00a5608 million. Income before Income Taxes and Minority Interests and Net Income The increase in operating income more than offset net other expenses. Income before income taxes and minority interests there- fore increased 26.0percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a539,963million. Income taxes increased 13.6percent to \u00a514,873mil- lion, but the effective tax rate decreased to 37.2percent from 41.3 percent for the previous fiscal year. As a result, net income increased 34.8percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a525,064million, and increased to 11.7per- cent of net sales from 9.3percent for the previous fiscal year. Net income per share increased to \u00a574.21from \u00a554.61for the previous fiscal year. Costs, Expenses and Income as Percentages of Net Sales Years ended March 31 2008 2007 2006 Cost of and minority interests . . . . Pharmaceuticals Segment In prescription drug sales, Crestor\u00aemarket share expand- ed steadily and sales increased substantially. In addition,sales of Claritin \u00aeand cancer pain drugs increased. On the other hand, sales of existing products including Flomox\u00ae, Flumarin\u00aeand Vancomycin decreased due to factors includ- ing market contraction and expanded use of generic drugs.Overall sales of prescription drugs increased 2.7percent compared with the previous fiscal year as increased sales ofCrestor \u00aeand other new products compensated for lower sales of existing products. In addition, sales of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs decreased due to challenging marketconditions, while sales of diagnostics increased slightly. Salesof contract manufacturing services, centered on subsidiaryBushu Pharmaceuticals Ltd., increased due to an increase inorders from customers outside the Shionogi Group. Royaltyincome from industrial property rights increased substantiallybecause of growth in overseas sales of Crestor \u00ae. As a result, sales of the Pharmaceuticals segment increased 8.6percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a5208 ,431million. Segment operating income increased 42.9 percent to \u00a538,819million, with the substantial increase in royalty income from industrial property rights more than off-setting higher R&D expenses. Other Segment Sales of the Other segment decreased 25.6percent compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a55,837million, primarily because of a decrease in construction contracts atShionogi Engineering Service Co., Ltd. Segment operating income decreased 7.4percent to \u00a51,580million. Net Income and Net \u0011\u0018Net Income (Left scale) Net Income per Share (Right scale) SHIONOGI & CO., LTD.

Research and Development Expenses In Japan, Shionogi conducted joint development with Schering Plough Corporation to develop an additional pediatric indication for allergy treatment Claritin\u00ae, which was approved in October 2007. In addition, Shionogilaunched a dry syrup formulation in January 2008.Moreover, Shionogi received manufacturing and marketingapproval for hypertension treatment Irbetan \u00aein April 2008 and began sales in July 2008. In addition, inJanuary 2008 Shionogi submitted an application formanufacturing and marketing approval for antidepressantduloxetine hydrochloride. Thus, along with idiopathicpulmonary fibrosis treatment pirfenidone, Shionogicurrently has two new drug applications pendingapproval. Drugs under development include a treatmentfor obesity, antibiotics, an influenza drug and a treatmentfor atopic dermatitis. Of note, Shionogi is developingdrugs including treatments for obesity and atopic der-matitis globally through Shionogi USA, Inc. Shionogi hasalso licensed carbapenem antibiotic doripenem for mar-keting in Europe and the United States to Johnson &Johnson, which received approval in the United States inOctober 2007. Shionogi expects Johnson & Johnson toexpand sales of this drug, which will increase incomefrom product supply and royalty income. In January 2008, Shionogi moved to create a globally competitive research environment with its decision toconstruct a laboratory in Toyonaka City, OsakaPrefecture that will serve as the new central laboratory.Shionogi believes that concentrating currently dispersedresearch functions and constructing a cutting-edge facili-ty is essential to maintaining and enhancing the globalcompetitiveness of research operations, and that doingso will further enhance Shionogi 's ability to create world- class drugs. As a result of these activities, overall Group R&D expenses were \u00a540,290 million, and represented 18.8 percent of net sales. Research and Development Expenses \u0011\u0013\u0011 provided by operating activities increased \u00a51,503 million compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a515,619 million. Contributing factors in this change includ- ed increases in income before income taxes and minority interests and depreciation and amortization, and adecrease in income taxes paid. Net cash used in investing activities totaled \u00a55,336 mil- lion, mainly due to investment in manufacturing facilities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled \u00a517,124 million due to cash dividends paid and purchases of trea-sury stock. As a result, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year decreased \u00a56,937 million from a year earlier to \u00a567,609 million. Statements of Cash Flows Highlights (Millions of yen) Years ended March 31 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating Capital investments by the Shionogi Group during fis- cal 2007 totaled \u00a513,069 million. The Group invested aggressively, focusing on expansion of research facilitiesand expansion of manufacturing facilities to increase pro-duction of new products. Capital investments in the Pharmaceuticals segment totaled \u00a512,133 million for Shionogi & Co., Ltd., and cen- tered on manufacturing and research facilities. Capital investments for drug manufacturing facilities at Bushu Pharmaceuticals and other consolidated sub-sidiaries totaled \u00a5929 million. As a result, capital investments in the Pharmaceuticals segment increased \u00a51,959 million compared with the pre- vious fiscal year to \u00a513,063 million. Capital investments in the Other segment totaled \u00a56 million.Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets As of March 31, 2008, total assets were \u00a5413,704 million, a decrease of \u00a515,865 million from a year earlier. Key factors included a decrease of \u00a513,926 million in current assets due to the use of cash and cash equivalents torepurchase shares, and a decrease of \u00a54,502 million in investments and other assets due to factors such as adecrease in investments in securities reflecting lowerstock prices. Domestic certificates of deposit formerlyincluded in cash and cash equivalents are included inshort-term investments from March 31, 2008. Total liabilities decreased \u00a512,349 million from a year earlier to \u00a571,468 million due to factors including a decrease in deferred income taxes resulting from areduction in unrealized gain on securities. Total netassets decreased \u00a53,516 million from a year earlier to \u00a5342,236 million. While retained earnings increased, anincrease in treasury stock and a decrease in net unreal-ized holding gain on securities reduced net assets. As a result, the net worth ratio, defined as the ratio of total net assets to total assets, was 82.7 percent, com-pared to 80.4 percent a year earlier. Balance Sheet Highlights (Millions of yen) % change As of March 312008 20072008 /2007 Current assets \u00a5194 ,964 \u00a5208 ,890 (6.7) Property, plant and equipment 70,378 67,815 3 .8 Investments and other assets 148,362 152,864 (2.9) Current liabilities 42,444 47,535 Report 2008 53Dividends Shionogi aims to steadily increase dividends in line with performance while investing aggressively in its busi- nesses to increase corporate value with a medium-to-long-term perspective. Appropriation of internal capitalresources emphasizes the demand for capital for futurebusiness development including investment in R&D todevelop new drugs. Shionogi 's target for the consolidated dividend payout ratio for fiscal 2009 is 35 percent. Shionogi 's Articles of Incorporation stipulate the distri- bution of retained earnings twice each year as interim andyear-end dividends when possible. The General Meetingof Shareholders held after the close of each fiscal yeardetermines the year-end dividend, and the Board ofDirectors determines the interim dividend. The year-end dividend for fiscal 2007 was \u00a512.00 per share. The total of the interim dividend and the year-enddividend was \u00a522.00 per share, an increase of \u00a56.00 com- pared with total dividends for the previous fiscal year.Consequently, the consolidated dividend payout ratio forfiscal 2007 was 29.6 percent. Business and Other Risks Systemic and Administrative Risk In the Japanese pharmaceutical industry, revisions to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system are underreview, including the NHI drug price system. Thesetrends could affect the results of the Shionogi Group. Risk of Adverse Drug Reactions Pharmaceuticals entail the risk of unanticipated adverse drug reactions that could involve terminationof sales, product recalls and other outcomes thatcould affect the results of the Shionogi Group. Pharmaceutical R&D Risk Pharmaceutical R&D requires substantial commit- ment of resources and time. In addition, new drugsare subject to numerous uncertainties prior to thestart of actual sales. Intellectual Property Risk The Shionogi Group uses patents as intellectual property to protect the pharmaceuticals it discoversand generate income from them. However ,thevarious types of intellectual property may be unableto provide adequate protection, or may infringe onthe intellectual property of third parties. Intensifying Global Competition Global competition that includes non-Japanese com- panies is intensifying further in pharmaceutical indus-try R&D and sales. Plant Closure and Shutdown Risk The sudden occurrence of natural disasters or other unforeseen incidents could result in the closure orshutdown of plants, which could affect the results ofthe Shionogi Group. Capital Market and Foreign Exchange Risk Fluctuations in stock and foreign exchange markets that exceed the projected range could affect theresults and financial position of the Shionogi Group. Other Risks The Shionogi Group is subject to various regulatory and economic risks other than those listed above. 54Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars (Note 3) ASSETS 2008 2007 2008 Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents (Note 9)...................................................................

Annual Report 2008 591. BASIS OF PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (the \"Company\" )and consolidated subsidiaries are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application anddisclosure requirements of International Financial ReportingStandards, and are compiled from the consolidated financialstatements prepared by the Company as required by the FinancialInstruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In addition, the notes to the consolidated financial statements include certain information which is not required under accountingprinciples generally accepted in Japan but is presented herein asadditional information. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all significant companies controlleddirectly or indirectly by the Company. Companies over which theCompany exercises significant influence in terms of their operatingand financial policies have been included in the consolidated financialstatements on an equity basis. The Company has applied the equitymethod to its investment in an affiliate for the years ended March 31,2008 and 2007. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates not accounted for by the equity method are carried at cost. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The fiscal year-end date of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries is December 31, a year end which differs from that of the Company.As a result, adjustments have been made for any significantintercompany transactions which took place during the periodbetween the year end of these subsidiaries and that of the Company. (b) Foreign currency translation All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and the gain or loss on each translation iscredited or charged to income. Revenue and expense items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are generally translated intoJapanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the respectivetransaction dates. Gain or loss on foreign exchange is credited orcharged to income in the period in which such gain or loss isrecognized for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dateexcept that the components of net assets excluding minority interestsare translated at their historical exchange rates. Adjustmentsresulting from translating the foreign currency financial statements arenot included in the determination of net income and are reported as\"Translation adjustments\" and \"Minority interests\" in net assets in theconsolidated balance sheets.(c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or lesswhen purchased. (d) Short-term investments and investments in securities Securities are classified into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading securities, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fairvalue. Gain and loss, both realized and unrealized, are charged toincome. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost.Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fairvalue with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of theapplicable income taxes, reported as a separate component of netassets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities arecarried at cost determined by the moving average method. (e) Inventories Inventories are stated at cost determined principally by the period average method.(f) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of buildings (except for structures attached to the buildings) acquired on or subsequent to April 1, 1998 is calculated principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation of other property, plant andequipment is computed by the declining-balance method over theuseful lives of the respective assets. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are summarized as follows: Buildings and structures 2 to 60 years Machinery, equipment and vehicles 2 to 17 yearsSignificant renewals and additions are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Effective the year ended March 31, 2008, the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries have changed their method ofaccounting for depreciation of property, plant and equipmentacquired on or after April 1, 2007 based on an amendment to theCorporation Tax Law of Japan. The effect of this change was todecrease operating income and income before income taxes andminority interests by \u00a5498 million ($4,971 thousand) for the year endedMarch 31, 2008 from the corresponding amounts which would havebeen recorded under the previous method. In addition, effective the year ended March 31, 2008, the salvage value of property, plant and equipment acquired before April 1, 2007which have been fully depreciated to their respective depreciablelimits under the Corporation Tax Law is to be depreciated to nil over aperiod of five years. The effect of this change was to decreaseoperating income and income before income taxes and minorityinterests by \u00a5850 million ($8,484 thousand) for the year ended March31, 2008 from the corresponding amounts which would have beenrecorded under the previous method.Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31, 2008Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 60(g) Intangible assets Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method. (h) Leases Non-cancelable lease transactions are accounted for as operating leases (whether such leases are classified as operating or finance leases), except that lease agreements which stipulate the transfer of ownership of the leased assets to the lessee are accounted for asfinance leases. Certain overseas subsidiaries principally account forfinance lease agreements as puschase transactions. (i) Research and development expenses and computer software Research and development expenses are charged to income when incurred. Expenditures relating to computer software developed for internal use are charged to income as incurred unless these aredeemed to contribute to the generation of future income or costsavings. Such expenditures are capitalized as assets and amortized bythe straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives,generally a period of 5 years. (j) Income taxes Income taxes are calculated based on taxable income and charged to income on an accrual basis. Certain temporary differences exist between taxable income and income reported for financial statementpurposes which enter into the determination of taxable income in adifferent period. The Company has recognized the tax effect of suchtemporary differences in the accompanying consolidated financialstatements. (k) Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries provide an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount calculated based on their historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receivables plusan additional estimate of probable specific bad debts from customersexperiencing financial difficulties. (l) Allowance for employees' bonuses Allowance for employees' bonuses is provided at the estimated amount of bonuses to be paid to the employees in the following year. (m) Retirement benefits The Company has a defined benefit pension plan known as a \"cash balance plan,\" which allows pension benefits to fluctuate in accordance with market interest rates, and also has a lump-sumpayment plan and a defined contribution pension plan. Certaindomestic consolidated subsidiaries have lump-sum payment plansand defined contribution pension plans. In addition, certainconsolidated subsidiaries have defined contribution pension plans. Accrued retirement benefits are provided based on the amount of the projected benefit obligation reduced by the pension plan assetsat fair value at the year end. Prior service cost is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, which is within the estimated average remainingyears of service of the eligible employees. Actuarial gain or loss is amortized each year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized, principally by the straight-linemethod over a period of 10 years, which falls within the estimatedaverage remaining years of service of the eligible employees.In addition, directors and corporate auditors of the Company who held their positions as of June 29, 2004 are customarily entitled tolump-sum payments under an unfunded retirement benefit plan,because the retirement benefits system for directors and corporateauditors was abolished in June 2004. The provision for retirementallowances for these officers has been made at estimated amountsbased on the Company's internal rules and no new provision has beenmade for the year ended March 31, 2008. (n) Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are utilized by the Company principally to reduce the risk arising from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. The Company has established a control environmentwhich includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and for theapproval, reporting and monitoring of derivatives transactions. TheCompany does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments forspeculative trading purposes. The Company is exposed to certain market risk arising from its forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company is also exposed tothe risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by thecounterparties to the currency contracts; however, the Company doesnot anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties all ofwhom are financial institutions with high credit ratings. (o) Distribution of retained earnings Under the Companies Act of Japan, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by resolution of the shareholders at a general meeting held subsequent to theclose of the financial period. The accounts for that period do not,therefore, reflect such distributions (see Note 21 ). 3. U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS The translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at\u00a5100.19 = U.S.$1.00, the approximate rate of exchange in effect onMarch 31, 2008.

BUSINESS COMBINATION On April 1, 2006 , Ohmori Group Honsha Co., Ltd., (Ohmori) was merged into the Company as a result of restructuring of the ShionogiGroup, and Ohmori was liquidated. Prior to the merger, Ohmori was a holding company and had five subsidiaries engaged in the pharmaceutical wholesale business. During 2002 , these subsidiaries merged with other companies and the main business focus of Ohmori turned to managing assets such assecurities issued by the other companies as a result of these mergers. The Company accounted for this business combination as a merger under common control which has been eliminated as aninternal transaction. Consequently, there was no effect on theconsolidated financial statements. 20. LITIGATION In March 2007 , a lawsuit was filed against the Company with the Osaka District Court by a former employee who is one of theinventors of \"Crestor, \"one of the main products of the Company, for which the Company obtained a patent, requesting the Company topay approximately \u00a5870 million ($ 8,683thousand) as compensation pursuant to Article 35of the Patent Act with reference to approximately \u00a520,300million ($ 202,615thousand) of revenues which the Company received up to September 30, 2006 from AstraZeneca PLC, the Company 's licensee of \"Crestor. \"This lawsuit is currently pending in court. In December 2007, the Company filed a patent infringement action jointly with AstraZeneca PLC against seven generic drug companies,such as Cobalt Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Apotex, Inc. and so forth, whichfiled a New Drug Application for the generic drugs of \"Crestor.\" Thepurpose of the patent infringement action is to prevent the sevengeneric drug companies from selling any generic drugs under thepatent owned by the Company in the United States of America. Thediscovery procedure has been initiated and it is anticipated that it willtake a long time for the trial to begin and a judgment to be taken. 21.
