In addition to the normal childhood colds and coughs, naturopathic pediatric care includes treatment of rashes, allergies, asthma, ear infections, strep throat, urinary tract infections, constipation, diarrhea, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and many other childhood illnesses and infections. Holistic pediatric doctors can also treat acute injuries such as sprained wrists, bumped heads and minor lacerations, referring for x-rays or more extensive suturing as appropriate. The Wisdom of Your Child's Healthcare With ever-increasing academic pressures, environmental pollution, food additives, the fast pace of a quickly changing world, constant media exposure to suffering and violence and less opportunity to discharge tension through playing outside, children today are perhaps under more stress than ever before. Tension can build up inside the body, leading to a decrease in normal function, which in turn makes it more difficult to process toxins, leading to reduced immunity, further tensions, irritability, poor concentration and variety of physical symptoms. Conventional medicine focuses on treating symptoms and diseases with prescription drugs. While at times these are necessary, antibiotics and other drugs can lead to problems of their own, and rarely address the underlying problems. Alternative pediatric care and holistic healing can address problems when they are still minor and prevent the development of more serious and chronic problems. Children respond readily to natural treatments and holistic medicine. Chronic conditions, such as asthma and allergies, are often treated very effectively, reducing or eliminating the need for prescription medications. (Note: If your child is on medication for asthma or another potentially life-threatening illness, DO NOT discontinue his or her medication unless doing so under the supervision of a licensed health care provider who is qualified to diagnose and treat illness.) Pediatric & Child Care Testimonials and Reviews What to Expect From Holistic Pediatric Care In a first visit, your Hawaii holistic doctor will usually discuss your child's entire health history with you and consider what genetic, environmental and nutritional factors could be contributing to your child's illness. He or she will perform a physical examination of your child, and may order laboratory tests to arrive at a diagnosis. He or she can provide you with nutritional, botanical and homeopathic remedies tailored to your child's needs, and that will help your child's system to be more resilient and resistant to infection. Often, a home treatment is recommended that will ease your child's discomfort and accelerate recovery. Occasionally, a first visit with a sick child will be briefer, focused on getting your child (and you!) some immediate relief, and leaving longer-term treatment plans for a later visit. If you have questions about nutrition, your naturopathic doctor will answer them and make helpful suggestions about providing your child with the best possible nutritional foundation. Most [naturopathic and holistic health doctors](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/services/naturopathic-doctor-honolulu/) also carry high-quality multiple vitamin and mineral supplements formulated especially for children. These professional grade supplements are free of dyes, additives and allergy-promoting substances that can be detrimental to your child's health, and are compounded using the forms of nutrients that can be most easily absorbed. If your child is nursing, naturopathic care and holistic healing will include a discussion of any breastfeeding problems, suggestions for dealing with teething problems and the best ways to introduce solid foods to minimize the development of food sensitivities that can lead to health problems such as ear infections and asthma.

Naturopathic medicine and holistic healing focuses on preventing illness and achieving optimum health. Naturopathic physicians are also trained and skilled in diagnosing and treating disease. Naturopathic pediatric care includes helping parents give their children the healthiest possible start in life, providing complete well-baby and child care, and treating a myriad of childhood ailments and chronic conditions. Hawaii holistic doctors are licensed as primary care physicians, along with MDs and DOs. They perform physical exams, order or perform diagnostic tests, and diagnose and treat illness. They are licensed to prescribe certain drugs, such as antibiotics and hormones, when appropriate. Most naturopathic doctors have a healthy respect for conventional medicine and have regular referral relationships with MDs who are open to naturopathic treatment. How Naturopathic physicians Are Different From a 'regular' Doctor People often ask, \"How is a naturopathic physician different from a 'regular' doctor?\" and sometimes think, \"I wonder if there is a holistic pediatrician near me?\" Where naturopathic physicians shine is in their treatment of the whole person, not just the symptoms. For example, it is not uncommon to have a parent bring in a child with recurrent ear infections. The child usually has received antibiotics multiple times and may be a candidate for a tympanostomy (having tubes put into her eardrums). In some cases, the child already has tubes, but is continuing to get ear infections. While her medical doctor has been diligent in treating the child's infections, there may never have been a discussion with the parents about what might be causing the recurrent ear infections and what steps can be taken to correct those causes. Tolle causum is something naturopathic doctors are instructed in school\u2014this is Latin for \"find the cause.\" Identifying and treating the underlying causes of illness is one of the guiding principles of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic Treatments Naturopathic treatment frequently involves dietary changes, and making sure that your child is getting more (or less) of certain foods. This type of treatment can show dramatic results, but it generally doesn't happen overnight. What do you do in the interim to bring your child (and yourself) some relief? Before the advent of antibiotics and modern drugs, physicians relied upon medicines derived from plant and animal sources to help their patients regain their health. Poultices and steams using medicinal herbs were used to speed recovery from colds and flu. These treatments may not seem to be as sophisticated as modern medicines, but with the dangers surrounding antibiotic overuse and the side effects produced by many medications, these treatments are gaining new respect. Naturopathic physicians have large dispensaries of treatments that can help alleviate symptoms when antibiotics or other drugs are not really the answer. "}
