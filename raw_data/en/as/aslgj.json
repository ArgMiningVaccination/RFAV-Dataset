The cold chain begins when vaccine is manufactured, moves through to the state di stribution center and ends with the local immunization provider at the time of administration. Cold Chain Management Anyone handling vaccines is responsible for their potency, at each step in transport, storage and administration of vaccines. Vaccines a re delicate biological substances that can become less effective or destroyed if they are: Frozen Allowed to get too hot Exposed to direct sunlight or fluorescent light Vaccines should be maintained within the recommended temperature range of 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) to 45\u00b0F (8\u00b0C). The loss of vaccine effectiveness is cumulative and cannot be reversed. Equipment for Transporting and Storing Vaccines The essential cold chain equipment needed to transport and store vaccines within a consistent safe temperature range i nclude: A refrigerator for storing vaccines A digital, electronic or mercury/maximum thermometer and chart for recording daily temperature reading Cold boxes for transporting and storing vaccines Ice packs to keep vaccines cool Material to separate ice pa cks from the vaccines when using cold boxes (e.g. shredded paper, cardboard, bubble wrap or Styrofoam). Refrigerators and Freezers It is recommended that one refrigerator should be dedicated to store vaccines. Points to consider when purchasi ng a refrigerator. Estimate the amount of vaccines required for your clinic's supply period, and choose a refrigerator that can store this amount in the middle and upper shelves with out crowding. At least 50% of the space needs to be filled at all times to allow for adequate circulation of cold air, and to stabilize the refrigerator temperature. [Vaccines should be maintained with the recommended temperature range of 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) to 45\u00b0F (8\u00b0C)]. Safe vaccines storage is possible with refrigerators if the following procedures or modifications are carried out. Maintenance of the vaccine refrigerator Report breakdowns immediately so repairs can be made Regularly check refrigerator seals to ensure cold air cannot leak out. If they are brittle or torn arrang e for replacement Defrost refrigerators are required to prevent ice build up which reduces efficiency. Ensure the area around (including behind and under) the refrigerator is clean and dust free Arrange for regular maintenance inspections by the manufactur er or technician. Inspections may need to be more frequent as the refrigerator ages. Defrosting or Cleaning When defrosting or cleaning the refrigerator, move the vaccines to second refrigerator. This temporary storage refrigerator must also be monitor ed to ensure the correct temperature 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) to 45\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) is maintained. If you don't have a storage refrigerator, store the vaccines in a pre -cooler insulted container with icepacks. Continue to monitor the temperature inside the container until the normal vaccine refrigerator is ready for use again. Power Failures During a power failure of 4 hours or less, the refrigerator door should be kept closed. If the power failure continues for more than 4 hours, store vaccines in an insulted container wit h ice packs. If power failures are a common occurrence consider purchasing a portable power generator, or, vaccines could be transferred to another site with power. Maintaining and Monitoring Refrigerator Temperatures The thermometer needs to measu re the refrigerator temperature close to the vaccine vials. Choosing a thermometer to monitor the vaccine refrigerator. Digital -type thermometers or mercury minimum -maximum thermometers are the reliable and easiest to read. Ordering Vaccines Keep vacci ne stock to a minimum by regularly ordering only the quantity of vaccine required for the period until the next scheduled delivery. Should always have at least 14 -day supply of vaccine in the refrigerator when you are re - ordering. Storing excess vaccines supplies in the refrigerator can increase the risk of wastage from vaccines. Equipment for Transporting Vaccines A number of issues should be considered when choosing equipment to transport vaccines. They should include: Space required for the amount of vaccine transported Number of icepacks needed to keep the vaccines at less than 50\u00b0F The length of time in transit How the cold box will be handled Criteria for Selecting a Cold Box It needs to be large enough to store vaccines and icepacks during transport External surface material needs to be durable and robust Lid needs to be tight fitting Strong handles for carrying the cold box Icepacks, Freezer Blocks, Ice Blocks Icepacks are used to cool insulated containers or cold boxes. Icepacks are flat plastic containers that are filled with water and froze. Some commercial icepacks contain a chemical product that ensures the icepack remains colder than 23\u00b0F (0\u00b0) longer than water -filled icepacks. Unpacking Vaccines after Transport Unpack vaccin es from the transport container and store them in their packaging regardless of their bulkiness. Removing vaccines from the original packaging exposes vaccines to room temperature and light. Check the temperature to ensure the vaccines have not been expo sed to temperatures above 35\u00b0F or below 32\u00b0F. Placing Vaccines in Refrigerator Store IPV, MMR on the top shelf If diluent accompanies MMR, Hib vaccine within vial packaging, the diluent must be removed and stored on the middle or next lower shelf All fre ezer sensitive vaccines should be stored on the middle shelves Diluent and emergency drugs can be stored on the lower shelves Vaccines should remain in the refrigerator until immediately before they are administered. They should be returned to the refrig erator immediately after drawing up each recommended dose. Refer to the New Jersey Vaccine For Children Vaccine return procedure and call Automated Health at 1(800) -900-4832 for information and vouches for lost and expired vaccines. "}
