That way I could compile a list of non-toxic play doughs and share it with you. I don't really know the specifics of what traditional Play-Doh is made of, I believe it's a proprietary recipe but the day-glow colors make me wonder just what the heck my kid is playing with. Not to mention might possibly be eating. You know they all taste it once right? So I went on a hunt for all the retail versions of natural alternatives that disclose their ingredients and possibly use safer ones. And we have a home recipe too for those that want to save a few pennies. When possible I had my 3-year-old son play with each brand for a week or so to give each one a fair test. We rated them on things like pliability, texture, smell, color, price, and fun factor... so now on to the showdown: List of Non-Toxic Play Dough The Dough Project We tested The Dough Project first and had a good time with it. The Dough Project most closely resembles the texture and feel of traditional Play-Doh. The colors are bright and rich, yet not day glow. They have a wide variety of colors available in 1-ounce tubs. The dough is unscented but has a doughy salty smell that isn't overpowering or weird. This dough lasts a long time with proper storage and was durable with repeated playtime. The dough didn't dry out unless left out too long. The plastic tubs keep the dough sealed air tight to help keep them preserved. They have play sets that include a wooden rolling pin and small \"cookie cutters\" that made this a bit more fun.

They are all made in the USA, they don't use synthetic dyes, instead opting for the plant, vegetable and fruit extracts to color their products. They use essential oils to keep the dough soft and pliable (and smelling pleasant!). These doughs are fun to play with and kept my son busy. Proper storage is essential with natural dough or they dry out pretty quickly. They smell nice and although they can get a little sticky after a while, they get the job done because let's face it, how long can a kid play with dough before they get bored. I like this company and their products, in fact, I use their wonderful eco-egg coloring kits at Easter time and they come out beautiful!
