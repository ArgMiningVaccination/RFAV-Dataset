To help you more fully understand what Reiki gives you, here are some terms used to describe Reiki:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Gentle:</b> Reiki's touch is soft and light.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Harmless:</b> Reiki can have only positive results.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Natural:</b> You don't need any equipment or tools.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Healing:</b> The highest level of healing is the goal of Reiki.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Balancing:</b> Reiki will balance your energy levels.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Relaxing:</b> The top reason to try Reiki is to feel the bliss of deep relaxation.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Energizing:</b> If you're drained of energy, Reiki will revive you.</li></ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >What Reiki isn't</h2>\\n<p>Knowing what Reiki isn't is as important as knowing what it is:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Reiki is not</b> <b>religious.</b> Reiki is totally nondenominational. You can practice any religion (or none) and still use and benefit from Reiki. Reiki Founder Mikao Usui was influenced by the religions of his country, Shintoism and Buddhism. But Reiki isn't associated with any religion, and people of all faiths and beliefs are Reiki practitioners. Reiki isn't New Age either.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Reiki is not</b> <b>massage or reflexology.</b> Reiki is an energy-healing system and not a manipulative system (hands moving the body). Reiki is distinct from reflexology and massage. But Reiki is sometimes confused with other hands-on healing arts, especially reflexology. </li></ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >Making isn't a religion, but it <i>is </i>spiritual. The distinction between spirituality and religion has caused a lot of confusion with regard to Reiki. These concepts are overlapping but separate. <i>Spirituality</i> is the belief in your connection with the divine, no matter whether you call it a higher power, God, spirit, soul, or even the stars. The purpose of spiritual development is to improve this connection and see the divinity within yourself and all around you.</p>\\n<p><i>Religion</i> provides guidance on how to develop yourself spiritually. It tells you what the divine looks like and gives you frameworks of texts, places of worship, and guides to support you.</p>\\n<p>You can be part of a religion and not have a spiritual connection. You can have a spiritual connection and not belong to a religion.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"Remember\\\">Reiki provides a means for spiritual growth. No matter what your religious background, you'll find that the principles are relevant and don't conflict with your religious practice. In fact, Reiki should enhance your personal religious connection. The spiritual aspects of Reiki enable you to do the following:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Connect to a higher source:</b> You use prayer and meditation to connect to God or the higher power of your own beliefs. Spiritual connection provides the never-ending supply of Reiki energy.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Channel the higher energy:</b> Reiki healing energy is not from the practitioner but comes through the practitioner from God or another higher power.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Keep spiritually healthy:</b> Just as you maintain your physical health with nutritious food, fresh air, and exercise, you also need to maintain your spiritual health. Prayer, meditation, quiet times, and spiritual exercise (doing kind acts) can help in this regard. Reiki uses the following spiritual tools: Reiki principles, meditation, and symbols and chanting.</li></ul>\",\"description\":\"<p>Reiki is popping up all over the place, but lots of folks are still confused about what Reiki is exactly. In the context here, Reiki is both:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>A healing system that channels universal life-force energy: </b>This system was originally developed by Mikao Usui in the early 1900s in Japan. </li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>The name of the energy itself: </b><i>Rei</i> means spiritual wisdom, and <i>ki</i> means energy, so <i>Reiki</i> means spiritual energy.</li></ul>\\n<p class=\\\"TechnicalStuff\\\">Some people use the word Reiki as a verb, as in \\\"I will Reiki him.\\\" What they are saying is, \\\"I will give Reiki to him.\\\"</p>\\n<p class=\\\"Remember\\\">Reiki is available to everyone. Anyone of any age or illness level can receive Reiki. Even newborn babies or people at the end of life can benefit from the relaxation that Reiki provides. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab1\\\" >What Reiki is</h2>\\n<p>In short, Reiki gives you what you need, whether it's a release of tension or an energy boost, or both. To help you more fully understand what Reiki gives you, here are some terms used to describe Reiki:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Gentle:</b> Reiki's touch is soft and light.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Harmless:</b> Reiki can have only positive results.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Natural:</b> You don't need any equipment or tools.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Healing:</b> The highest level of healing is the goal of Reiki.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Balancing:</b> Reiki will balance your energy levels.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Relaxing:</b> The top reason to try Reiki is to feel the bliss of deep relaxation.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Energizing:</b> If you're drained of energy, Reiki will revive you.</li></ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab2\\\" >What Reiki isn't</h2>\\n<p>Knowing what Reiki isn't is as important as knowing what it is:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Reiki is not</b> <b>religious.</b> Reiki is totally nondenominational. You can practice any religion (or none) and still use and benefit from Reiki. Reiki Founder Mikao Usui was influenced by the religions of his country, Shintoism and Buddhism. But Reiki isn't associated with any religion, and people of all faiths and beliefs are Reiki practitioners. Reiki isn't New Age either.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Reiki is not</b> <b>massage or reflexology.</b> Reiki is an energy-healing system and not a manipulative system (hands moving the body). Reiki is distinct from reflexology and massage. But Reiki is sometimes confused with other hands-on healing arts, especially reflexology. </li></ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab3\\\" >Making isn't a religion, but it <i>is </i>spiritual.

Silver, gold, and iron are examples of elements that on their own make up crystals. The chemical symbols for these elements are Ag for silver, Au for gold, and Fe for iron.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Minerals:</b> Most minerals are made from combinations of elements. Two or more elements combine to form a mineral. Chalcedony, for example, is a type of mineral formed by the chemical elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O2) to form silicon dioxide (SiO2). Other elements may combine with the silicon dioxide to give other minerals different colors. Red chalcedony is formed from silicon dioxide plus iron.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Crystals:</b> The repeated arrangement of minerals into distinct geometric shapes is called a crystal. The geometric pattern or shape is unique to each type of crystal. Crystals are fascinating because of this beautifully ordered construction.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Rocks:</b> A rock or stone is a hard substance formed from minerals or petrified life forms. Crystals are frequently found within rocks.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Gems:</b> A gem is a crystal stone (or pearl) that is considered precious due to its ability to be cut, polished, and used in jewelry or other products. Diamonds, emeralds, and pearls are examples of gems.</li></ul>\\n<p>Some gems come from living things rather than minerals. This category includes pearls, coral, amber, and jet. Like their mineral counterparts, these remnants of life also emit a subtle energy, and though they are not really crystals, they are included in the practice of crystal healing.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"Remember\\\">Crystals are made of minerals, which are made of elements. Crystals are sometimes considered gems (which will make them more expensive to obtain), and crystals are found in rocks.</p>\\n<p>Many crystals used for healing purposes are reasonably priced, including the powerful clear quartz crystal that is used to amplify healing. Herkimer diamonds, for example (which aren't really diamonds but a type of quartz found exclusively in Herkimer County, New York) are clear stones.

Silver, gold, and iron are examples of elements that on their own make up crystals. The chemical symbols for these elements are Ag for silver, Au for gold, and Fe for iron.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Minerals:</b> Most minerals are made from combinations of elements. Two or more elements combine to form a mineral. Chalcedony, for example, is a type of mineral formed by the chemical elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O2) to form silicon dioxide (SiO2). Other elements may combine with the silicon dioxide to give other minerals different colors. Red chalcedony is formed from silicon dioxide plus iron.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Crystals:</b> The repeated arrangement of minerals into distinct geometric shapes is called a crystal. The geometric pattern or shape is unique to each type of crystal. Crystals are fascinating because of this beautifully ordered construction.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Rocks:</b> A rock or stone is a hard substance formed from minerals or petrified life forms. Crystals are frequently found within rocks.</li></ul>\\n<ul><li><b>Gems:</b> A gem is a crystal stone (or pearl) that is considered precious due to its ability to be cut, polished, and used in jewelry or other products. Diamonds, emeralds, and pearls are examples of gems.</li></ul>\\n<p>Some gems come from living things rather than minerals. This category includes pearls, coral, amber, and jet. Like their mineral counterparts, these remnants of life also emit a subtle energy, and though they are not really crystals, they are included in the practice of crystal healing.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"Remember\\\">Crystals are made of minerals, which are made of elements. Crystals are sometimes considered gems (which will make them more expensive to obtain), and crystals are found in rocks.</p>\\n<p>Many crystals used for healing purposes are reasonably priced, including the powerful clear quartz crystal that is used to amplify healing. Herkimer diamonds, for example (which aren't really diamonds but a type of quartz found exclusively in Herkimer County, New York) are clear stones. Colored types of quartz are also available, including smoky quartz and rose quartz.</p>\",\"blurb\":\"\",\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":10402,\"name\":\"Nina L.
