The approach is to treat the body, mind and spirit as a contiguous whole while seeking to support each person in engaging their optimal level of health. Integrative Medicine has been called the \"new medicine\" but in many ways, it is a return to the original practice and philosophy of medicine. It emphasizes the relationship between the doctor and patient, the innate healing ability of the body and the importance of addressing all aspects of an individual's life to attain optimal health and healing.
