She has been closely involved in taking Naturopathy in Western Australia from its infancy to today's effective, professional level of natural healthcare. Since 1984, Val has practiced from the present clinic and patients have watched the practice grow, especially since 1996 when the premises were extended and her integrated team of carefully selected natural and orthodox health professionals was brought together. Recognised as the 'grandmother' of the industry in Western Australia, Val has represented natural therapists at the National Council level of the Australian Natural Therapists Association of which she is a Fellow and Life Member. Val is often sought as a media spokesperson and is a regular presenter on topical issues connected with natural therapies. She was a senior lecturer at the Perth Academy of Natural Therapies. Having such a large patient following and with her special focus on complex cases and cancer patient care, Val has surrounded herself with excellent colleagues who are able to successfully treat the ever-increasing number of new patients which her well-respected clinic attracts. Val has published her practical healthcare guide and recipe book, Very Wellness, which proved to be a runaway success throughout Australia. Perth Natural Medical Clinic's integrative team of highly qualified professionals have been supporting the health, quality of life and longevity for Western Australian families since 1979.
