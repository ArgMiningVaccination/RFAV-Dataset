With astronauts expected tobeout exploring the moon, suits must bebuilt with joints that move easily enough topermit climbing around onrugged terrain. This requireskeeping the suit volume constant atalltimes, thereby ensuring that minimum work isdone ontheenclosed gas. The traditional approach isviathe so-called soft suit, which isconstructed mainly ofrubberized fabric. A variety ofbellows and inflatable bladder arrangements have been devised toprevent itfrom ballooning atthejoints. Problems still remain, and inanattempt toovercome them designers have turned tohard suits ofmetal (Massachusetts Instltute ofTechnology, ofElectronics, Cambridge; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Eaton-Peabody Laboratory, Boston, Mass. ).
