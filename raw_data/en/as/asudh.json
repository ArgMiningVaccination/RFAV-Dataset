Many patients and community members have reached out to purchase HydroMassage Session. This is a great way to support Elite Chiropractic as a small business, give back to the community we love and treat yourself as well! We know the stress of the current COVID-19 situation can cause tension on the body. During the month of April, Elite Chiropractic is donating 50% of all HydroMassage profits to the Baldwin City Emergency Fund. These are hands free massages that can be purchased now and used later or even given as a gift! 1 (15 minute) session is $20 or you can buy 6 (15 minute) sessions for $100. Together, we can make a positive impact during this trying time! Call 785-594-1191 to purchase and/or schedule. As mentioned before, they can also be used at a later date! We will continue to stay open and serve patients during this time. Chiropractic care is deemed essential and is important for us to stay open to help the medical community treat musculoskeletal complaints. Give us a call with any questions. "}
