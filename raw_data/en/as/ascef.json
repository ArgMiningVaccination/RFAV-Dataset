Pure fragrances are flower essences, or essential oils, that contain the [Prana](https://piorliving.com/ayurveda/prana-definition) of the plant. When we use essential oils in a diffuser or on our skin, our bodies absorb the essence of the plant and it gets distributed to all of our body channel systems or srotas and affects our minds and senses. This has a profound impact on our doshas. We can therefore harness the power of Ayurveda and aromatherapy to balance the doshas. Ayurveda Aromatherapy for Each Dosha Use the following guidelines to learn the types of essential oils, carrier oils (it is recommended to dilute most oils in a carrier oil) and location of application that are best for each [dosha constitution](https://piorliving.com/ayurveda/ayurvedic-constitution) as well as DIY blends. Vata Aromatherapy The Vata dosha benefits from hot and wet qualities to counterbalance its cold and dry nature. The best oils for Vata are: rose, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, vetiver, rosewood, sage, cinnamon, oregano and thyme. Vata also does well with orange and lavender as well. All carrier oils are good for Vata, especially sesame and hazelnut. These oils are heavy and will nourish Vata's deep tissues (Vata needs a lot of care in the bones and connective tissues) For Vata, apply the oil on the third eye.

As you come back to balance, practice essential oil massage once a week, then continue with daily self-massage as part of a daily regimen. As you practice self-massage, take note of the changes happening in your body, mind and emotions. Please share your experience with me! I hope you enjoy my blends!
