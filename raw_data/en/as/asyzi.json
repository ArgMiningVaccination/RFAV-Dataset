Symptoms arise because our body is out of balance energetically. Acupuncture treatment balances the body's excesses and deficiencies. - Chinese Medicine diagnosis is based on not just symptoms but taking into consideration the whole person. Most often, illness of a patient is the end results of his/her makeup of individual constitution, age, sex, personal relationships or lack thereof, job, and environmental influences. - Acupuncture treatment focuses on treating acute symptoms as well as the underlying chronic symptoms. Therefore it has long lasting effect of maintaining and balancing health. - Chinese Herbal Medication is based on classical herbal formulas that have been developed, modified and adjusted for more than a thousand years. They are natural plant, animal and mineral-based products processed under standard methods. - Scalp/Neuro acupuncture - Acupuncture - Chinese herb - Auricular therapy - Cupping - Gua Sha "}
