It represents the culmination of many years of work by practitioners, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (PFIH) and the Department of Health in conjunction with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The stimuli for this were the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology's report in 20001 and the Government response to it in 20012. The recommendations in this report have taken account of emerging health policy over the past decade relevant to protecting patients and new ways of working for healthcare professionals. Th ere has been positive discussion with statutory regulatory bodies, particularly with the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is the proposed new regulator for acupuncture, herbal/traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine as well as with professional bodies and pr actitioners. The report is therefore framed within the context of existing health policy. In addition, there has also been constructive discussion about regulation of this sector with the home countries of the UK. Given the complexities of parallel medicines legislation and the need to ensure that the public interest is protected through easy movement of health professionals across the UK, and public recognition of regulated professionals, it is to be hoped that the recommendations will lead to UK-wide regulation. The document consists of the main report that makes specific recommendations for regulation. It is followed by a series of Annexes that in turn explain the nature of herbal/t raditional medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine and provide further detailed information that will be useful to members of the public and other health professionals as well as to the Department of Health and the future statutory regulatory body. Other Annexes provide information on the development of a research and evidence base for these sectors, on existing training provision and accreditation arrangements as well as the criteria used by the Steering Group to assess the potential of professional practition er associations to qualify for direct transfer to the chosen regulatory body. It has been a privilege to chair the Steering Group on behalf of the Department of Health. The report has been informed by expert input from practitioners, orthodox health professionals, statutory regulators and, significantly, by independent lay me mbers of the Steering Group. Lay involvement has been particularly helpful both in ensuring that public safety issues have taken precedence and in reso lving contentious issues. It is of the greatest importance that the recommendations in this report are acted upon quickly in order to protect public health and to ensure it remains feasible 3 under medicines legislation for practitioners and their patients to have continuing access to a wide range of herbal medicines. I am extremely grateful to all members of the Steering Group for their hard work and commitment to producing this report. In particular I would like to thank the lay members and secretar ies to the Steering Group, Amrit Ahluwalia and Christine Black, for their tremendous support. This report is agreed by all members of the Steering Group. It is important, however, to record that on some matters there were different views and it was not always easy to achieve consensu s. Some of the different approaches were relatively minor such as contrasting views on how to describe types of acupuncture through to more serious considerations about the necessity to be able to communicate in English. Colleagues representing traditional Chinese medicine are deeply concerned about the emphasis we have placed upon the need to be able to communicate adequately in both spoken and written English but the overwhelming view of the Steering Group was that this should be a key recommendation. We do however encourage our Chinese-speaking colleagues to work to gether and enter into discussions with the future statutory regulatory body with regard to English-language comprehension. These discussions will be all the more effective and productive if traditional Chinese medici ne practitioners can be represented by a single-body spokesperson. Professor R.

Establishment of the Steering Group and Terms of Reference The Department of Health Steering Group for the Statutory Regulation of acupuncture, herbal medicine and trad itional Chinese medicine practitioners was established by Jane Kennedy, then Minister of State in the Department of Health, in June 2006 specifically to prepare the ground for the regulation of practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems practised in the UK. In addition to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) these traditional medicine systems include Ayurveda, Unani Tibb (a system of traditional medicine with roots in Greek, Middle-Eastern and Indian Medicine), Kampo (Japanese traditional medicine) and Tibetan Medicine, all of which are currently practised in the UK. The Steering Group was invited to prepare the way for formal regulation by identifying issues and proposing options in relation to education and training, registration, fitness to practise and other aspects of regulation. Although the Steering Group was formed by the Department of Health in England, from the outset the Steering Group has considered the needs of the home countries and its membership has been UK-wide. 2. Background to the Establishment of the Steering Group - The House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology's Report in 2000 and the Government Response The House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology's report in 2000 1 on complementary and alternative medicine represented a significant milestone in shaping Government policy with regard to complementary and alternative medicine . Inter alia it specifically recommended that practitioners of acupuncture and herbal medicine should be statutorily regulated under the Health Act of 19993. The House of Lords' report1 recommended statutory regulation for herbal medicine and acupuncture because they met key criteria that included risk to the public thro ugh poor practice, the existence of a voluntary regulation system and a credible, if incomplete, evidence base. It did not consider that Ayurvedic medi cine, Chinese herb al medicine or traditional Chinese medicine should be covered by statutory regulation. However, the Government response proposed that professions using either acupuncture or herbal medicine (ther eby also including Chinese herbal medicine, TCM, Ayurveda and other tr aditional medicine systems mentioned in Section 1) should, in the interests of public safety, be statutorily regulated and that \"it would be desirable to bring both acupuncture and herbal medicine within a statutory framework as soon as practicable\"2. 7 3. Previous Working Groups Support ing the Statutory Regulation of Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine and the Department of Health Consultation and Report In 2001 the Department of Health, in partnership with the Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health, established two Working Groups for the regulation of acupuncture and herbal medicine. The Acupuncture and the Herbal Medicine Regulatory Working Groups both reported in 20034,5 and, in March 2004, the Department of Health consulted on a set of proposals for the statutory regulation of he rbal medicine and acupuncture6. In February 2005, the Department of Health reported on the consultation indicating that it expected to publish a draft Section 60 Order for consultation later that year7. 4. Reviews of \"Medical and Non- Medical Regulation\", Subsequent Publication of a White Paper and the Consequences for the Steering Group The delay in establishing the current Steering Group was partly due to the need to await the outcome of two reviews of professional regulation which were not published until July 2006 following which there was a further period of consultation. The first of these reviews, Good Doctors, Safer Patients 8, was undertaken by the Chief Medical Officer for England and the second, The Regulation of the Non-Medical Healthcare Professions9, was led by the then Director of Workforce for the Department of Health in England. Following the consultation, a White Paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety - the Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century10, was published in February 2007. Publication of the White Paper several months after the Steering Group had been established had significant impact in informing our recommendations in regard to the future statutory regulatory arrangements for practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems practised in the UK. In particular, the White Paper 10 ruled out the possibility of the formation of new statutory councils to regulate professions aspiring to statutory regulation. It recommended instead that statutory regulation of emerging professions should take place through existing regulatory bodies (see Sections 10 and 11 below). 5. Emerging Health Policy and the Steering Group In addition to the policy documents referred to above, the Steering Group has also taken account of emerging he alth policy relating to workforce development. We have framed our recommendat ions taking cognisance of recent and emerging NHS policy that has impacted upon other health professions 11-15. Significant policy changes this century have included increased emphasis on inter-professional team working15, role-extension for existing health professionals including the ability of healthcare professionals to undertake roles customarily carried out by others (in some cases including 8 the work traditionally undertaken by doctors) and the need to modernise regulation11-15. 6. Statutory Regulation and the Public Interest The Steering Group is strongly of the view that the decision to statutorily regulate professions practising herbal medicine and acupuncture is in the public interest. Survey data demonstr ates high demand for complementary and alternative medicine16. 10.6% of the adult population of England had visited at least one therapist providin g any one of the six more established therapies (acupuncture, chiropractic, homoeopathy, hypnotherapy, medical herbalism, osteopathy) during 1998 with an estimated 22 million visits16. It is important that those with whom they consult are properly trained, understand the limits of their competence and know when and to whom to refer. There has also been widespread concern about the safety, in particular, of traditional Chinese medicines when inappropriately administered 17 (see Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's webpages for examples at www.mhra.gov.uk ). Statutory regulation differs from the voluntary registra tion currently in place fo r the professions covered by this report and for other compleme ntary and alternative (CAM) therapies including that being extended to other CAM therapies with the support of the Department of Health (DH) and The PFIH. Statutory regulation can more effectively assure the standards of th ose regulated, protecting the public from poor or bad practice, because legal sanctions exist to remove individuals from a register. Statutory regulatory bodies determine standards of practice and competence. Those who meet the criteria set for determining competence are eligible to be included on a register and to use a protected title. 7. Authorised Health-Professional Status via Statutory Regulation The Medicines and Healthcare produc ts Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has proposed in its consultation on the reform of Section 12(1) of the Medicines Act 1968 18,19 that statutorily regulated herbal practitioners could be regarded as authorised healthcare professionals for the purposes of Article 5.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC (the main European medicines legislation). This is the provision under which a Member State may permit the supply of manufactured unlicensed medicines, if ordered by, and made to the specification of, an authorised healthca re professional, to meet the special needs of an individual patient. Afte r April 2011, transitional protection afforded under the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive for certain existing unlicensed manufactured herbal products runs out. Subsequently such products would require either a marketing authorisation or a traditional herbal registration - which would not be a feasible process in most cases given the likely small scale of supply wh ere practitioners require a specific formulation for individual patients. The key point is that a scheme to allow the availability of such manufactured herbal products under the Article 5.1 derogation is not regarded by the MHRA as legally viable for herbal 9 practitioners unless statutor y regulation of the profes sion is in place. The consequence if such arrangements are not established is that after 2011 there is likely to be a significant reduction in the scope and range of herbal medicines that herbal practitioners could use and a resultant loss of consumer choice. 8. The Health Professions Council Although there are significant differences in the way that acupuncture and herbal medicine is practised, the Steer ing Group recognises that the creation of several statutory regulatory bodies to accommodate the wide range of professionals that exist is neither practical nor consistent with the recommendations within the White Paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety - the Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century 10 and Government policy to reduce the numbers of regulatory bodies. We are mindful that costs are reduced as a statutory regulatory body increases in size. In the case of the professions covered in this report th ese costs are, in effect, largely borne by the public who for the most part acce ss professionals privately rather than through the NHS. For this reason anything that can be done to reduce costs is in the public interest provided this does not compromise the process. The Steering Group takes the view that ef fective, safe and cost-effective statutory regulation has b een demonstrated by the multi-professional Health Professions Council (HPC) and is convinced that this could be extended to cover practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional-medicine systems practised within the UK. We recognise, however, that given that the HPC was established from professions largely familiar with statutory regulation under the auspices of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine, the workload associated with acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine might be greater than that pr eviously experienced in regulating well-established health professional sectors. 9. The Health Professions Council Criteria for Aspirant Professions The Steering Group was concerned that acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine do not meet all the criteria as currently stated for entry into the HPC 20. These specify that aspirant groups must: 1. Cover a discrete area of activity displaying some homogeneity 2. Apply a defined body of knowledge 3. Practise based on evidence of efficacy 4. Have at least one established professional body which accounts for a significant proportion of that occupational group 5. Operate a voluntary register 6. Have defined routes of entry to the profession 10 7. Have independently assessed entry qualifications 8. Have standards in relation to conduct, performance and ethics 9. Have Fitness to Practise procedures to enforce those standards 10 Be committed to continuing professional development. Specifically, currently none of the prof essions considered in this report has a single voluntary regula tory body representing all of the relevant practitioners. Perhaps more importantly, the evidence base for the effectiveness of acupunc ture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine is not as widely accepted as for many of the other professions regulated by the HPC. Whilst it can be argued that the evidence base should be established in advance of statutory re gulation, we are firmly of the view that, in the interest of public safety, statutory regulation should now proceed with all possible speed. We strongly recommend that the various disciplines seeking regulation should simultaneously be encouraged to establish a robust evidence base. The Steering Group recognises that there are significant challenges in developing a strong research and evidence base for much of complementary and alternative medicine (these issues are discussed in Annex 1). Notwithstanding this, the need to demonstrate benefit is essential if credibility with other health pr ofessionals is to be realised and NHS resources are to be made available to fund these therapies. We recommend that public funding from the NHS should be used to fund CAM therapies where there is evidence of effica cy, safety and quality assurance. 10. Other Regulatory Options Considered by the Steering Group As noted above (Section 8), the Steering Group was convinced of the need to achieve efficiencies of scale by bei ng regulated by a larger body. In determining the appropriate statutory regulatory body for acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese m edicine and other tr aditional medicine systems, Government policy has been influenced both by previous reviews 8,9 and the White Paper10 (see Section 4) which have, in turn, influenced our recommendations. Prior to the publication of the reviews of medical8 and non-medical regulation9 and then the White Paper10, the Steering Group did however investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different regulatory arrangements. One option explored was the concept of a Traditional Medicines Council or Complementary and Alternative Medicine Council. This could have been introduced whilst at the same time reducing the overall number of statutory regulatory bodies as well as distinguishing complementary and alternative medicine from the statutory regulatory arrangements for the orthodox healthcare professions. One possibility we considered in pursuit of this aim was that the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) and the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) might be amalgamated within this new body thus reducing the overall number of regulators. However, when consulted, 11 neither of these bodies were interested in creating a Traditional Medicines (or Complementary and Alternative Medicines) Council. In considering these options we noted that, in the case of the manipulative therapies, three different statutory regulatory bodies (the HPC, the GOsC and the GCC) are involved in regulating professions amongst which there is significant overlap of practice. Moreover, the smaller of the statutory regulatory Councils have significantly higher registration costs to individual practitioners which, as noted above, are passed on to patients. There was some concern that whilst Government policy supports the retention of existing relatively small r egulatory bodies - even where there is significant overlap of practice - it does not permit any new ones to be created. We felt there was a missed opportunity to bring about a measure of rationalisation, reducing the number of bodies whilst creating a new statutory regulatory body sympathetic to the na ture of complementary and alternative medicine and associated public safety issues. Having made these observations, we accept that the issue raised has now been superseded by the White Paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety - the Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century 10. The Steering Group has every confidence in the ability of the HPC to statutorily regulate practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese m edicine and other tr aditional medicine systems effectively and efficiently and thus to protect the public from poor practice. 11. Pharmacy and Herbal Medicine Practice It should be noted that there was some discussion as to whether practitioners preparing and supplying unlicensed herbal medicines to meet the needs of individual patients mi ght be statutorily regulated alongside pharmacists. Little enthusiasm for this option could be identified amongst both pharmacists and herbalists suggesting that such an arrangement could only be achieved by a level of coercion. As the White Paper determined that the HPC should be the preferred regulator 10, and in view of other doubts which some members of the Steering Group had about the appropriateness of this option, we did not pursue the idea further. 12. Implications for the Health Prof essions Council Arising from Dealing with a Variety of Tr aditional-Medicine Systems It is important to recognise that the fundamental approach and philosophy of complementary and alternative medici ne, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional-medicine systems (such as Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine) differ in many ways from the stance taken by orthodox healthcare professions. This has implications for developing a robust research base, underpinning evidence-based practice, and interfacing with other healthcare professionals. The HPC will need to take account of these differences, although they do not impact on its key role of effective protection of the public. 12 The HPC will also need to devise suitable structures and processes to take account of the different and many tr aditional-medicine systems that use acupuncture and herbal medicine. There are clearly too many of these to enable representation at all levels within the Council. However, the Steering Group is of the view that the HPC will be able to accommodate the diversity of traditions that exist and ensure that decisions relating to, for example traditional acupuncture, Ayurveda, Western herbal medicine, Tibetan medicine or traditional Chinese medici ne are informed by practitioners and experts in the relevant tradition. There will be an ongoing vital role for the professional associations and individual practitioners in providing profession- specific information and input (see al so discussion in Sections 22 and 23). 13. Resource Implications for the Health Professions Council There are likely to be significant resource and organisational issues for the HPC. There is a wide variety of tradit ions practising acupuncture and herbal medicine. Identifying lead bodies and representatives for complementary and alternative medicine has historically been a challenge and the professions will need to work constructively and effectivel y to support the HPC. It is likely that the HPC will need additional resources during the early stages of the statutory regulation of these professi ons to ensure there is effective and efficient implementation. In time, as these professions gain experience, the workload should diminish along with the need for additional pump-priming of financial and administrative support. 14. Use of Acupuncture, Herbal Me dicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine by Other Statutorily-Regulated Professions The Steering Group consulted other statutory regulatory bodies to confirm whether existing statutorily regulated he althcare professionals might wish to be called herbalists or acupuncturists. Whilst protection of title enables appropriately qualified healthcare prof essionals to extend their scope of practice, it does not allow them to assu me a different title, if that title is already protected by anothe r statutory regulator. There is significant use of acupuncture and herbal medicines by a range of health professionals including doctors, physiotherapists and nurses. However, the only existing statutorily regulated professionals that currently seek to be able to describe themselves as acupuncturists are the medical acupuncturi sts (although at some point physiotherapists and nurses might also wish to have this option open to them). Doctors using acupuncture have expressed concern that protection of the title 'acupuncturist' may mean that they are prosecuted for using it. Discussions with the HPC and the General Medical Council (GMC) have focused on the fact that, under the Health Professions Order 2001, an offence is committed if a title is misuse d with intent to deceive. It has been suggested therefore that an agreement could be reached by the HPC that other statutorily regulated professionals could use the title 'acupuncturist' 13 provided that they were clear in providing information to their patients that they were, for example, registered doct ors who provided acupuncture as part of their practice, and that their patients were not misled as to the nature of their qualifications or professional back ground. If there were any difficulties, these could be addressed by their own statutory regulatory body. In discussion, the GMC and the HPC have suggested that one solution would be agreement that doctors qualified in medical acupuncture should be free to describe themselves as acupuncturists without having to be dual registered with the HPC. If there were any difficulties, these could be addressed by their own statutory regulatory body, the GMC, in consultation with the HPC. Doctors wishing to practise traditional acupuncture would need to ensure that they had met the requirements of the HPC with regard to this speciality as the training is quite different from that required for medical acupuncture (see Section 15). Any advice given by the HPC, responsible for the statutory regulation of traditional acupuncture, would need to take account of the significant differences between this trad ition and medical acupuncture. This would also apply to advice given to ph ysiotherapists, or to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, or to other statutorily-regulated health professionals using acupuncture. 15. Traditional and Medical Acupuncture Traditional and medical acupuncture are quite different in terms of their underlying philosophy even though there can be significant overlap with regard to practice. The traditional acupuncturist will rely in part on an energetic diagnosis, whereas the medica l acupuncturist will investigate using techniques familiar to those trained in or thodox medicine. It is important that the future regulator identifies these significant differences and that the different approaches (even within traditional acupuncture itself) are recognised without one having precedence over the other. 16. Scope of Professional Practice We have reached agreement on the scope of professional practice for acupuncture, herbal medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. From this, standards of proficiency using the HPC template have also been determined and are submitted as Annexes to this report (Annexes 2-4). 17. Standards of Education and Training Standards of education and training have also been determined and are submitted as Annexes to this report (Annexes 2-4) along with known education and training provision (Annex 5). The criteria that have been agreed by the Steering Group for Accr editation Boards are listed (Annex 6) although at this time it could not be confirmed that all of the voluntary registers operate to this standard. The threshold entry route to the register will normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours which is comparable to the majority of other professions regulated by the HPC. Entry 14 to the register may also be possible through possession of an appropriate Masters degree; this is consistent with other professions including physiotherapy, radiography and occupation al therapy. Overseas qualifications will need to be considered separately. 18. Standards of Conduct, Performa nce and Ethics for Registrants Standards of conduct, performance and ethics for registrants have been agreed and are entirely consistent with those operated by the HPC. 19. Protection of Title The Steering Group recommends that, consistent with Government policy, for new professions, protection of title is achieved through statutory regulation rather than protection of function. Th e Steering Group recognises there is an inherent tension in the legal protection of titles. On the one hand, there is a need to minimise the number of titles th at are protected, in order to ensure that these titles can be clearly communicated to the public, and are readily understood and seen as credible. On the other hand, it is also important that existing, commonly used and recognised titles should be protected in order to ensure that individuals do not use these titles as a means of avoiding regulation. The group recognised that there is a wide range of titles in use by these practitioners, and that not all of these titles could be protected. The titles that should be protected have been the subject of some debate, notwithstanding that the Steering Group recognises that protecting particular titles would not bar registered practition ers from using a different title should they so wish. The Steering Group therefore recommends that the titles of 'acupuncturist' and 'herbalist' should be protected, since these are widely used, commonly recognised and simple titles that lend themselves easily to being protected. Registered individuals who wished to add to these titles to show a particular area of practice (for example, 'Medica l Herbalist') could do so, whereas those who were not registered could not us e these titles, nor any title which contained the words 'acupuncturist' or 'h erbalist'. In addition, the Steering Group recommends that the title 'traditional Chinese medicine practitioner' should be protected. Similarly, those who are not registered will not be allowed to use this title, nor any title which contains the words 'Chinese Medicine Practitioner'. The group recognises that there is a variety of other titles used by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, along with Ayurveda, Kampo, and Tibetan Medicine, but believes that protecting a large number of further titles would be count er-productive in terms of public protection. It is also unlikely that l egislation could protect every individual title that existing practitioners use in th is field. Hence the group believes it is more practical to protect a small number of titles, recognising at the same time that this must necessarily represent a compromise, and may not be the preference of all practitioners or all professional associations. 15 The Steering Group believes that, wi th the support of professional associations, statutorily regulated pr actitioners should be encouraged to advertise their services using their prefer red title, stating, in addition, that they are HPC registered. The HPC already offers an 'e-kit' for registrants with images that can be downloaded for use in advertising material encouraging users to reinforce their registration with a logo. It also offers other public- facing material for registered profession als to use, including leaflets, posters and window-stickers. This facility may be of particular interest to those practitioners primarily operating in the private sector. It may also help members of the public to identify a ppropriately qualifi ed practitioners. 20. Control of Function Although the HPC will be protecting title and not function, the changes to Section 12(1) of the Medicines Act 19 68 currently envisaged by the MHRA will regulate function so far as the practice of herbal medicine is concerned 18. We do not envisage any difficulties for other statutorily regulated healthcare professionals wishing to use acupuncture, herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine as part of their practi ce provided that they ensure they are appropriately qualified.(See Sections 14 and 27). It will be important for the HPC to provide guidance to other statut ory regulatory bodies with regard to minimum levels of educatio n and training required for other professionals to practise acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional-medicine systems. 21. Grandparenting Whenever a professional title is protect ed, there is opportunity for individuals who have been using that title safely and effectively to become registered. This process is known as 'grandparenting' . This is a 'one-off' window of time during which individuals can apply to be registered. After this period of time has elapsed, the only way for a UK-trai ned individual to become registered is to complete a UK regulator-approved course. With regard to grandparenting, there are several aspects to be consider ed. In addition to individuals making their applications for registration, and being assessed individually, there is also the possibility for bona-fide members of voluntary registers to be transferred directly onto the HPC Register without having to go through such individual registration. This has hap pened in the past with the Operating Department Practitioners, where memb ers of the voluntary register were automatically transferred, becoming registered on the day the Register opened. Subsequently these newly regist ered practitioners were required to pay their registration fees and renew their registration in order to remain registered. More information about the pr ocess of voluntary register transfer is available on the HPC website 21. There is therefore an option for the grandparenting of complete memberships of voluntary registers as well as of individuals. 16 With regard to grandparenting of vol untary registers, there are significant challenges. The Steering Group is supportive of grandparenting being inclusive, but without compromising pu blic safety. The Steering Group drew up criteria to judge whether voluntary registers were operating at a level similar to standards applied by the HPC in protecting the public (Annex 7). Based on external peer review and lay-member and stakeholder-chair opinion we are able formally to recommend to the HPC a number of voluntary registers where there is e vidence that they have been effectively and rigorously operated to high standards. In these cases, we recommend that registrants should, subject to confirmation by the HPC, automatically transfer to the appropriate HPC register when it is established. It should, however, be made clear that the Steering Group is in no sense mandating that the HPC takes this action but, on the evidence presented, we believe these organisations have operated approp riately under a voluntary code and, in our view, demonstrated over a period of time good practice with regard to protecting the public. The organisations that meet the criteria are The Acupuncture Association of Physiotherapists, The British Acupuncture Council, The British Dental Acupuncture Society, The British Medi cal Acupuncture Society, Ayurvedic Practitioners Association, Association of Master Herbalists, The College of Practitioners of Phytotherapy, The Nati onal Institute of Medical Herbalists, The Unified Register of Herbal Practi tioners and The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine. It is essential to note that in forming such judgements we have accepted at face value the information submitted to us in support of meeting our criteria and the Steering Group strongly recommends that this evidence undergoes a further in-depth audit by the HPC before the Regulator agrees any grandparenting exemptions for members of particular professional associations. There are also voluntary registers for which we have insufficient evidence to be able to recommend such a transfer at this time. Where possible we have indicated what additional steps the organisations hosting thes e registers should take to ensure they might qualify for the direct transfer of th eir members to the HPC and encouraged them to enter into discussion with the new statutory regulatory body as soon as practicable. There remains some concern about the way that some voluntary registers within the traditional Chinese medicine sector determine acceptable levels of English comprehension. It appears that these organisations may operate a somewhat over-lenient policy with regard to the level of English comprehension required to qualify for their membership. Having noted this, The Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and The Chinese Medicine Council met all other criteria. The British Association of Traditional Tibetan Medicine is a very small organisati on but met the criteria through its affiliation to the European Herbal an d Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association with its well-established federal arrangements for overseeing quality. 17 Organisations that have not succeeded in satisfying all the criteria have received confidential feedback from the Chair of the Steering Group and it is hoped they may all be able to satisfy the criteria by the time of the establishment of the statutory regulatory body. It will, of course, be possible for individuals who are not members of a voluntary organisation or who belong to one that does not meet the criteria to apply for registration with the HPC, potentially by the grandparenting route. The precise standards for such individual grandparenting are yet to be determined. 22. The Role of Professional Bodies Once a profession is subject to statutory regulation, its professional body or bodies continue to play an important role in promoting and developing the profession, representing their members, and offering services. The services professional bodies choose to offer may vary, depending on the organisation's priorities, or resource s, but these could include publishing journals or newsletters, running Cont inuing Professional Development (CPD) training programmes and special interest groups, providing support if a complaint is made, providing some form of trade union or industrial relations function, and others. In relation to regulation, professional bodies may develop their own curriculum framework documents, which education providers may use in order to design a programme of study that meets, and in many cases exceeds, the Standards of Proficiency for their profession. Professional bodies also have an important role in the development of standards for best practice, or the development of new areas of their profession. Most professions will have standards for best practice which are exemplary, but are not mandatory requ isites in order to be registered, because registration is based on minimum threshold standards necessary for public safety. It may be the case that over time, these standards for best practice become so embedded within education and practice that the case can then be made for these to become part of the threshold standards: at this stage what was once 'desirable' best practice becomes a 'required' threshold standard that individuals must prove they can meet in order to be registered. This organic process of a prof ession's evolution is often driven by the professional body. 23. Profession-Specific Input The Steering Group is of the view that the consultation processes used by the HPC to obtain profession-specific input is entirely appropriate for practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, tr aditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems. Currently, the HPC draws on profession-specific input in a variety of ways and the as sociations representing acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chines e medicine should be encouraged to engage with these processes as soon as possible. One example of professional input informing developments at the HPC is through regular formal and informal liaison with professional bodies, of which the foundation 18 is an annual meeting between the Chief Executive, President, and representatives of the professional body where information can be exchanged, and any pertinent issues raised and discussed. Professional bodies may also respond and contribute to HPC consultations, where appropriate. In addition to this, there are many projects on which collaboration with professional bodies is welcomed by HPC, or indeed is vital to ensuring success. Current work where professional bodies are being invited to participate at an early stage includes revalidation, the review of the Standards of Education and Training, and post-registration qualifications. Previously, professional bodies have ma de detailed submissions to the review of the Standards of Proficiency, to guidance for education providers, and to the guidance for registrants on Co ntinuing Professional Development standards. The HPC depends upon the professional knowledge and expertise from the professions it regulates to provide det ailed input, particularly into its standard-setting process. This would normally be done by a Professional Liaison Group which is a working gr oup formed from HPC Council members plus external stakeholders with particular knowledge and expertise to consider a defined project in detail. This provides a way for the HPC to draw on expertise from outside its Council, including membership from professional bodies, and it is anticipa ted that this mechanism would be used for establishing standards for practiti oners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other tr aditional medicine systems. It is important therefore that professional associations representing these modalities begin to prepare now to support their practitioners in the move towards statutory regulation and liaise effectively with the HPC. 24. Language Comprehension The Steering Group is of the view that English-language proficiency is essential for all healthcare professions. We do not believe that public safety is assured through the use of interpreters whether this be in communicating with patients or with other healthcare professionals. We are, however, aware that this could cause a significant difficulty particularly with regard to the traditional Chinese medicine sector and that some practitioners who are very experienced and proficient might no longer be able to practise. Furthermore, there are Chinese-speaking members of the community who might consequentially be denied access to traditional Chinese medicine because their Chinese-speaking practitioner was disbarred from practice due to poor English-language skills. Taking all this into account and after careful consideration, we believe that all th ose practising acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine or other traditional medicine m o d a l i t i e s s h o u l d b e a b l e t o a c h i eve an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of at least 6.5, or utilise other methods of testing to achieve an equivalent standa rd, by the time these professions are regulated. In the meantime, we urge organisations representing and working with Chinese-speaking practi tioners and other practitioners for 19 whom English is not their first language to work with the HPC to ensure that there is no discrimination against such practitioners whilst at the same time recognising that protection of the public health must be the paramount concern. This is facilitated through excellent communication with patients and other healthcare practitioners to whom referral might be made or who are also responsible for treating shared patients. 25. Statutory Regulation an d the Home Countries Although this report was undertaken on behalf of the Department of Health (England), we have been anxious to ensure wide engagement with the Home Countries. Informal discussion has taken place with representatives from the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Irish Assembly and the, then, Scottish Executive now known as the Scottish Government. In Scotland, the regulation of existing health professions is reserved to Westminster but the Scottish Government does have the power to regulate new health professions. However, the Steering Grou p is firmly of the opinion that there are many benefits to UK-wide regulation, and our recommendation is that statutory regulation should proceed on this basis, providing that the needs of the devolved administrations are taken account of. We believe that there are benefits for professionals in terms of common standards and education requirements, and benefits for the public in a single, accessible system with, for example, one set of protected titles , and one register to check online. The Steering Group is concerned that were different arrangements to be adopted for the statutory regulation of herbal and traditional medicine practitioners in Scotland and England, this would be likely to lead to considerable confusion when practitioners migrate from one jurisdiction to another. It could frustrate practitioners working in different parts of the UK amongst which there can be a sharing of good practice, and could limit access by the public to practitioners by restricting their mobility. Anything that made it more difficult for English, Welsh or Northern Irish practitioners to work in Scotland, for example, would not be in the interests of the Scottish people. Differing regulatory ar rangements are most unlikely to be in the public interest and the implications for medicines legislation would need careful consideration. Feedback from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been that public safety should be paramount particularly in relation to the establishment of statutory-regulato ry arrangements. Strong views were put forward with regard to the need for commonality in the robustness of grandparenting and English-language comprehension. 26. The Next Steps The Steering Group is of the view that there is an urgent need to proceed without delay with the statutory regulation of practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese m edicine and other tr aditional medicine systems. The Department of Health ha s been working with practitioners from these sectors, in some cases for over a decade, and a timeframe has been 20 published that has not been adhered to7. Given the size of the regulatory reform agenda set by the White Paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety - the Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century10, achieving statutory regulation in time to ensure that it is feasible for medicines legislation to permit registered practitioner s to have continuity of access to a wide range of manufactured herbal medicines to meet th e needs of individual patients will present a significant challenge. Failure to commit to an early timetable for the statutory regulation of these professions would hinder the achievement of effective regulation of herbal medicinal products prepared for practitioner use. It could adversely impact on consumer and practitioner choice and continue to frustrate the possibilities for referrals to practitioners from orthodox healthcare professionals. It could also frustrate UK-wide regulation. Above all, the public would not be protected from inappropriately qualified practitioners and poor professional practice. 27. Statutory Regulation and Reform of Section 12(1) of the Medicines Act of 1968 - Taking into Account other Complementary and Alternative (CAM) Practitioners who may Prepare and Supply Unlicensed Herbal Medicines to Meet Individual Needs The MHRA report that during their consultation 18,22 on reforms of Section 12(1) of the Medicines Act of 1968, a number of practitioners from various CAM traditions beyond herbal medicine /traditional Chinese medicine said they made use of Section 12(1): that is, they prepared unlicensed herbal medicines to meet the specific needs of individual patients identified in face- to-face consultation. Respondents in this position were concerned about their continuing ability to practise in their field if, as proposed, Section 12(1) were restricted to statutorily registered practitioners. Examples given in response to the most recent consultation include some homoeopaths prescribing herbal tinctures at material dosage, some naturopaths, aromatherapists, and certain shopkeepers23. Historically, the weak Section 12(1) regulatory arrangement has been allowed to operate in a largely uncontrolled way leading to a wide variety of practice. This makes any reform of the regime problematical. Nevertheless, we believe that the following considerations should guide action on this issue providing the basis for fair, consistent and safe reform of Section 12(1). Public health protection is best served if there is a consistent approach taken to the competencies, training and experience required to practise herbal medicine safely. Agreed standards of training and practice should be applied across the board to all those wishing to practise under Section (12)1. The most clear cut, reliable protection for the public is achieved if those who prepare unlicensed medicines to meet individual needs are subject to statutory regulation. If, to the contrary, practitioners who are not statutorily regulated are a llowed to continue to make up unlicensed medicines under Section 12(1) this could create an 21 incentive for some herbal/traditional medicine practitioners to opt out of statutory regulation while continui ng to practise herbal medicine. Such a scenario would undermine the purpose of statutory regulation and compromise public health protection. Any change to access to Section 12(1) has to take account of the fact that, as previously mentioned, over time a variety of practitioners and individuals from a range of CAM backgrounds have made use of this provision. On the other hand, it s eems unlikely that Government policy will extend statutory regulation to a widening range of CAM practitioners in the foreseeable future simply to reflect the fact that various therapies may include a certain number of practitioners who have been making use of Section 12(1). Transitional grandparenting arrangements should permit skills and experience in the practice of herbal medicine acquired through a variety of routes to be recognised. Thus practitioners who can demonstrate a history of safe use of unlicensed herbal medicines via Section 12(1) and who meet agreed standards of practice required of herbalists, e.g. in the knowledge of potential herb/drug interactions, could be accepted onto a section of the statutory register in a way that does not compromise the identity of herbal practice. Use of Section 12(1) is a profession al activity requiring professional skills and professional accountability. It should not be confused with retail supply of over-the-counter herbal medicinal products and regulatory arrangements should be kept correspondingly distinct. On the basis of these considerations we recommend that use of Section 12(1) of the Medicines Act of 1968 should be restricted to practitioners who are subject to appropriat e statutory regulation. We also recommend that further consultation should take place with those CAM professions that would be affected by the application of the approach we are recommending. 28. Method of working The Steering Group met on five occasions. The Steering Group and subsidiary Stakeholder Groups were extremely fortunate to be able to draw on the services of a number of highly experienced lay members who provided invaluable advice throughout the process of formulating this report. Three subsidiary Stakeholder Groups, led by Chairpersons from the main Steering Group, were established to work on matters pertaining to acupuncture, herbal/traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine respectively. These Stakeholder Groups met several times during the duration of the Steering Group. In addition, the three Stakeholder-Group Chairs met separately with the Chair of the Steering Group together with lay-member 22 attendees. The Stakeholder Chairs worked with their colleagues to provide material intended to help the HPC assume responsibility for the statutory regulation of practitioners of acup uncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems practised in the UK (Annexes 2-4).

Personal communication 24 ANNEX 1 Developing Research and Providing an Evidence Base for Acupuncture and Herbal/Traditional Medicine Treatment 1. Introduction This paper introduces the evidence base supporting herbal/traditional medicines and acupuncture and presents some of the challenges which need to be addressed in the development of a rigorous and appr opriate research programme for these therapies. Herbal/traditional medicine and acupuncture have for the most part been practised for hundreds, even thousands of years - a feature which needs to be considered when it comes to building an evidence base. This is recognised in the European Directive on Traditio nal Herbal Medicinal Products which notes that \"The long tradition of the medicinal product makes it possible to reduce the need for clinical trials in sofar as the efficacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience.\" (Directive 2004/24/EC). Nonetheless, whilst taking into account generations of clinical experience, ongoing experime ntal research is an essential process to establish further the safety and effectiveness of these forms of intervention. Acupuncture and herbal/traditional medi cine typically involve individualised treatments based on a complex clinical encounter. This suggests that to measure effectiveness in a meaningful way requires a specific programme of research to be developed for these therapies which combines pragmatism with scientific rigour. 2. Current Status 2.1 Western herbal medicine Western herbal medicine has its roots bo th in the indigenous practises of the British Isles (Bryce 1988) and in the European and Greco-Roman traditions, and can trace its lineage back to Dios corides, Hippocrates and Galen. There have been further influences from North America (Cook 1869) and more recently this traditional knowledge has been enriched by a stream of scientific insights and discoveries into the pharmacology of plants and their use as medicines. There have been numerous in vitro and in vivo trials on herbal medicine which explore the biological mechanisms at work which have established the benefits of single ingredients such as gingko ( Gingko biloba ) for mild to moderate depression (Linde 1996). However research has tended to concentrate on over-the-counter (OTC) products rather than investigating th e effectiveness and safety of herbal practice within a one-to-one consultation in which prescriptions typically comprise a complex mixture of herbal medicines and treatment is tailored to the individual needs of each patient. The effectiveness of individualised tr eatment was recently assessed in a systematic review of randomised herbal medicine in any indication (Guo 2007 et al). Somewhat surprisingly, the authors of this study found only three randomised clinical trials that met their criteria. They reported that individualised treatment was superior to placebo in four of the five outcome measures in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Bensoussan 1998), but was inferior to standardised herbal treatment in all outcomes. The authors (Guo et al,2007;634 ) noted that \"Patient BSS (Bowel Symptom Score) at a follow up 14 weeks afte r the end of the trial favoured the individualised over the standard but this was not statistically significant\". Guo et al concluded that there is \"a sparsity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of individualised herbal m edicine and no convincing evidence to support the use of individualised herbal medicine... (introductory abstract Conclusions p.633) and \"Because of the high potential for adverse effects and negative herb-herb and herb-drug interactions, this lack of evidence for effectiveness means that its use cannot be recommended\" ( Conclusion p.637). This bleak view may be seen as unduly harsh since it is based on only three trials deemed to meet the se lection criteria. Absence of evidence is, of course, not evidence of absence and the findings of this study may be perceived as a commentary on the general thrust of research that in the final analysis tends to seek out standardised products that can be patented and marketed - something not achievable with individualised treatments. This is undoubtedly a major reason for the paucity of research into individualised herbal/traditional medicine or acupuncture treatments that have their roots in millennia of human experience. In contrast, recent research has challenged the notion that the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of herbal medicine is generally inferi or to the evidence available for conventional medicine (Nartey 2007). 2.2 Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) CHM has an unbroken recorded history of use stretching back some 2000 years. Early texts such as Zhang Zhong-jing's Discussion of Cold Damage (Shan Han Lun ) or Shen Nong's Classic of the Materia Medica (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ), actually written by anonymous hands probably in 1 st Century BCE (Unschuld 1986), demonstrate a so phisticated understanding of herbal medicine which still has clinical relevance today. The written contributions of thousands of herbal doctors over the past two millennia means that there is a vast corpus of recorded information and empirical insights underpinning the contemporary practice of CHM. 26 In recent decades CHM has been increasingly subjected to investigation using modern methods of research. It has been estimated that over 10,000 randomised controlled trials were conducted in China before 1997 (Tang 1999) and in the past 10 years this process of research has accelerated. A recent ongoing systematic review of CHM for endometriosis (Flower 2007), which revealed 116 Randomised Contro lled Trials (RCTs) exploring the treatment of this condition, exemplifie s the wealth of clinical trial data available from Chinese journals. This is an important source of research data which was not referred to in previous re views of CHM (House of Lords 2000). Although there has been justifiable criticism of the methodological weakness of some of this Chinese research there is increasing emphasis in recent years on improving the rigour and transparenc y of reported clinical trials. There has been a number of Coch rane reviews of CHM wh ich have indicated the therapeutic potential of CHM for conditions such as dysmenorrhoea (Zhu 2007), hyperthyroidism (Zen 2007) and schizophrenia (Rathbone 2005) while stressing the need for better trial design. Some rigorous trials have been carried out in the West, and have demonstrated positive benefits from CHM intervention. These include randomised controlled trials of CHM in the treatment of IBS (Bensoussan 1998) and atopic eczema (Sheehan 1992, Sheehan & Rustin 1992). The challenge for research into CHM is to develop trial designs which combine methodological rigour with a pragmatic approach to the delivery of CHM as it is used in clinical practice . The use of individualised treatments, herbal decoctions, and the importance of the non-specific effects of CHM intervention, present difficulties for double blind RCTs which can only be overcome by careful thought and consideration, as well as appropriate training and funding. 2.3 Ayurvedic medicine Ayurveda (Sanskrit meaning 'the science of life') is a comprehensive system of health care that originated in Indi a. The earliest literary references to Ayurveda as a medical science are datable to around 500 BCE, probably evolving from older oral trad itions. The two most important classical Ayurvedic texts are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita , compiled between the second century BCE and second century CE. Today, traditional Ayurvedic medicine and its practice are subject to ongoing scientific assessment by international science establishments. The Indian Government Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Central Council for Research in Ayur veda & Siddha (CCRAS) have undertaken a range of clinical studies that have yielded encouraging results in reviewing the safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic re medies (Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha Website). 27 Internationally there have been many studies on the efficacy of different Ayurvedic preparations such as kalamegha (Andrographis paniculata ) for the 2006), sallai guggulu (Boswellia serrata ) for the treatment and osteoarthritis (Kimmatkar 2003), mandukaparni (Centella (Kawamori 1999) and also for its positive effects in the treatment of IBS (Bundy 2004). Although there is variance in the methodological rigour of some Indian studies, research on Ayurveda generally indicates positive outcomes that are a spur to further research of this sector. Scientific enquiry into the efficacy of Ayurvedic medicine has, for the most part, been confined to investigating single traditional medicines to treat spec ific diseases. As yet, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of Ayurvedic therapeutics that takes into account traditional methods of prescribing per sonalised treatments for individual patients based on their presenting symptoms and diagnosed humoural imbalances. Future research needs to focus much more on these holistic aspects of Ayurveda, since this will evaluate its essentially patient-centred approach and its value as a health-care system. 2.4 Kampo Kampo is an ancient system of formulae -based herbal medicine originating in Japan. The practice of Kampo ha s developed through three roots; commentaries on the Chinese Han Dynasty medical classics, modifications of classical formulae through centuries of Japanese experience, and a uniquely Japanese diagnostic system (Shirota 1996). Around 75% of Japanese conventional medical doctors prescribe Kampo ( Watanabe 2001). The costs of prescribed formulae are supplemented by national-health insurance. Consequently research on efficacy, including large scale RCTs, has not been required for the funding or general availability of Kampo medicines. Kampo research has focused on mechanisms of action and significant work has been done to establish this in vitro and in vivo (Miyate 2007, Oikawa 2005). Kampo herbal pr oducts conform to international standards of GMP and are accepted in the USA for clinical trials as \"lawfully marketed botanical products without safety concerns\" (Watanabe 2007). 2.5 Traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM) Traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM) has be en a distinct tradition for over 1200 years and has built up a theoretical approach which integrates Chinese, Ayurvedic, Bonpo (Tibet's oldest spiritual tradition) and Persian medical systems with Buddhist understanding of the mind. TTM does not share the Decartian mind/body dichotomy characteristic of the approach of much modern biomedical science. 28 The translation of medical knowledge across cultures is the domain of medical anthropologists like Adams who has reviewed the interface between TTM and western medical understanding (Adams 2001). Adams (Adams 2005) and Millard (Millard - awaiting publication) have both examined the process of the scientization of Tibetan medicine in Tibet and Europe (in other words, how it has been transformed and evaluated according to the principles of western science and biomedicine). In addition, the recently launched Journal of Traditional Tibetan Medicine ( http://www.iattm.net/uk/pub.htm ) provides information about TTM to a broader audience. A small number of clinical trials have been conducted into the efficacy of TTM testing out its remedies in the treatmen t of diseases, classified according to the biomedical model. Clinical trials using PADMA-28, a herbal formula combining 28 ingredients, have demonstrated an anti-atherosclerotic effect (Brunner-La Rocca 2005). In addition, in a randomised controlled trial PADMA-28 has been shown to be effective for treatment of intermittent claudication (Sallon 1998) and the mechanism by which this herbal mixture achieves this anti-atherosclerotic ef fect has also been explored (Winther 1994). Further research suggests that PADMA-28 may prove beneficial for the prevention of cell damage induced by pro-inflammatory agonists that initiate tissue destruction in inflammatory and infectious conditions (Ginsburg 1999). Preliminary work has also investigated the potential of TTM in the treatment of diabetes (Chotak 1993, Gompo 1993). In a controlled study, individualised treatment provided by a Tibetan practi tioner for type-two diabetes was used as adjunctive treatment alongside st andard western dietary and lifestyle management compared to standard west ern diet and exercise alone. The research team reported \"a significant improvement in glycaemic control with the use of Tibetan medicine in patients with a recent onset of type-two diabetes compared with patients treated only with diet and exercise. This improvement in glycaemi c control was observed at three and six months following commencement of treatment\" (Tenzin 2001). Further preliminary research has tested TTM in the treatment of arthritis. One study was undertaken in Tibetans in the refugee communities in Northern India. The Tibetan treatment was compared with western orthodox medical treatment in an open random ized controlled trial, and the authors concluded that \"the trial demonstrat ed that for these Tibetans, their indigenous treatment worked better than the western treatment for improved limb mobility\" (Tenzin 2001). TTM has also been evaluated alongside other traditional herbal treatments for the treatment of IBS and a systematic review in the Cochrane database indicates some benefit for the treatment of IBS using TTM remedies (Liu 2006). One of the studies reviewed another TTM formulation, PADMA LAX, 29 which was effective in treating constipation-dominated IBS when compared with standard western treatments (Sallon 2002). 2.6 Acupuncture Acupuncture has been used in the Orient to restore, promote and maintain good health for over 2,500 years. An early account of ac upuncture was given in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Intern al Medicine (Huang Di Nei Jing) which dates from around the second century BCE (Unschuld 1985). Traditional acupuncture is rooted in the Daoist philosophy of change, growth, balance and harmony, and The Yellow Emperor's Classic outlines the principles of natural law and the movements of Qi (vital energy), blood, yin and yang, the five elements, the organ system and the meridian network along which acupuncture points are located. The meridian system was mentioned in earlier texts (dating back to the 3rd or 4th century BCE) found during excavations of a Han Dynasty to mb in Hunan Province in 1973 (Qiu Mao-liang 1993). Acupuncture developed over centuries in China, its theory and practice refined by master-practitioners such as the Han dynasty 'surgeon', Hua Tuo (110-207 CE), the Tang dynasty phys ician, Sun Si Miao (581-682 CE) and the Ming dynasty herbalist Li Shi Zen (1518-1593 CE). The use of acupuncture and moxibustion (the burning of the dried leaves of Artemisia vulgaris to provide local heat over acupuncture points) spread across East- Asia particularly to Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Centuries of accumulated recorded experience from these sources provides the foundation for traditional acupunct ure practice today. In the last thirty years, medical acupuncture has developed in the UK and elsewhere in the West using neuro-physiological principles based on evidence that acupuncture needles stimulate ne rve endings and alter brain function, particularly the intrinsic pain inhibitory mechanisms (Han 1982). Acupuncture experienced a great resurgence of interest in China after the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949 and has been extensively researched in China since the 1960s, notably in respect of physiological mechanisms and the evaluation of new techniques. Most of this work is restricted to Chinese-language journals and is unknown in the West. This is also the case for the substantial output from countries that were part of the former Soviet Union, which have made important contributions in electro-acupuncture and the use of various related devices. Western medical databases now contain thousands of acupuncture research entries, including clinical trials, laboratory experiments, evidence reviews, surveys of use and attitudes, and qualitative studies. Acupuncture is a complex intervention and lack of a suitable placebo control has hindered efforts to evaluate efficacy. However, in recent years a number 30 of rigorous RCTs have established the benefits of acupuncture for knee arthrosis (Berman BM 2004, Vas 2004, Witt C 2005, Scharf 2006, Bjordal 2007, White A 2007), arthritis of the hip (Witt 2006) chronic low-back pain (Furlan 2005, Manheimer 2005, Witt 2006), neck pain (Vas 2006, Trinh 2006,Witt 2006) and migraine headaches (Melchart 2004). To this can be added evidence of efficacy in treating more acute conditions such as post- operative pain (Almi 2003) nausea an d vomiting (Dundee 1989, Gan 2004, Lee 1999), anxiety disorders (Pilki ngton 2007), dysmenorrhoea (Habek 2003, White 2003), and pain control afte r oral surgery (Lao 1999). Recent studies have also provided evidence of cost-effectiveness for treating conditions such as low-back pain (Thomas 2005, Thomas 2006, Ratcliffe 2006, Witt 2006), headache (Jena 2004, Vickers (two papers) 2004, Wonderling 2004, Herman 2005), knee pa in (Manheimer 2007), hip arthritis (Witt C 2005, Reinhold 2007), and neck pain (Willich 2006). The GERAC (German Acupuncture trial) trial on low-ba ck pain found acupuncture to be superior to guideline-based standard treatment, though not superior to minimal (superficial non- point) acupuncture. On the basis of this, the German health authorities decided that acupuncture will be included in routine reimbursement by social health insurance funds for the treatment of low-back pain (Molsberger 2006). Cl inical-audit data show significant reductions in referral rates (Myers 1991 , Lindall 1999, Ross 2001). Properly practised, acupuncture is a relatively safe form of therapy (MacPherson 2001). In the evaluation of acupuncture interventions, it should be borne in mind that different styles of acupuncture operate with different conceptual frameworks and modus operandi and such variables are likely to influence the assessment of outcomes. For this reason, differing styles of acupuncture need to be acknowledged and defined in any research program. In addition, research design needs to be patient-centred to ensure that benefits important to the patient are not overlooked, especially in evaluating the overall benefits of supportive care for some chronic diseases where conventional treatment has relatively little to offer. 3. Appropriate Research As mentioned above, it is important to acknowledge the long tradition of herbal/traditional medicines and acup uncture, the use of which stretches back hundreds and, in some cases, thou sands of years. These traditions have codified detailed accounts of the long -term efficacy and safety of their medicinal products and/or interventions which, as also mentioned above, obviate the need for extensive preclinical testing. Familiarity with this corpus of knowledge should be the starting point for any modern research programme. A systematic research strategy for assessing acupuncture and herbal/traditional medicine practice should involve a progressive gathering of 31 increasingly detailed data which grows into a convincing portfolio of evidence that balances rigour (internal validi ty) and relevance (external validity). Research into these therapies needs to be both appropriate and pragmatic. Whilst the pharmaceutical gold standa rds of RCTs and systematic reviews have a place in this research, other methods such as outcomes studies, case-controlled studies and qualitative research should play a significant role in validating treatment in the round. Table 1 (see page 9) adapts a model for a research strategy suggested by the Medical Research Council in ' A framework for development and evaluation of RCTs for complex interventions to improve health' (MRC April 2000). The various phases of rese arch require different methods of evaluation which, when combined, could provide a systematic research programme to explore these therapies. 4. Problems and Possibilities Problems that could obstruct research into acupuncture and herbal medicines include economic, methodological and ethical barriers. 4.1 Economic Research into bio-medical medicine is primarily funded by the pharmaceutical industry. As mentioned, individualis ed herbal/traditional medicine and acupuncture treatments do not usually utilise marketable medicinal products and consequently struggle to attract research funding because financial returns from the sale of herbal/traditional medicinal products marketed for the treatment of specific ailments are not forthcoming. In addition, there is little support for practitioner researchers in the form of research scholarships. In future, it is hoped that more Go vernment funding can be allocated to research into traditional/herbal medicines and acupuncture and that grants will become available to encourage practitioners to undertake postgraduate research work. In March 2007, the Chinese Government pledged to spend over $130 million over the next five years on research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (Qiu 2007). It is to b e h o p e d t h a t t h i s m o n e y w i l l b e targeted effectively to evaluate TCM. 4.2 Methodological There is a relative lack of research expertise within the CAM practitioner community and, judging from many research trials conducted so far, a failure by researchers to understand the heterogeneity inherent in providing individual treatment that is an essentia l feature of much herbal/traditional 32 Table 1: Developing a framework to evaluate acupuncture and herbal medicines .

This has led to poorly designed and inadequately deployed studies, the results of which have little or no meaning for any of the stakeholders involved. Appropriate methods of research need to be employed to measure the effectiveness of these interventions in settings that reflect real-world practice. The complex interaction of specific and non-specific effects from acupunct ure and herbal/traditional medicine interventions, together with the individualised treatments that often change 33 throughout the course of treatment, make considerable methodological demands when it comes to designing valid research programmes. The recent introduction of research methodologies as a component of acupuncture and herbal/traditional me dicine undergraduate training will undoubtedly improve this situation but there needs to be more collaboration between researchers from outside the se ctor and practitioners within it. In addition, when funding applications are peer reviewed, it would be helpful if the funding panel were experienced in the complexities involved in researching these interventions. It would benefit the public who wish to use these modalities if funding were to be made available to encourage and enable experienced practitioners to research their work. 4.3 Ethical Ethics committees are generally unaware of the specific nature of these interventions and sometimes have difficulty in granting permission to research this sector because, for example, of unfamiliarity with the individualised nature of much herbal/t raditional medicine or acupuncture treatment. 5. Conclusion The recorded history of traditional use over many years should be evaluated and incorporated into the evidence base supporting the effectiveness and safety of herbal/traditional medicines and acupuncture. In addition, stakeholder needs, including those of the patient, service providers, and the practitioners, require that this corpus of knowledge is subjected to a particular scientific scrutiny that needs to combine methodological rigour with an appreciation of the complex and in dividualised nature of these forms of medical intervention. The provision of adequate funding, training, institutional support, and collaboration between practitioners and researchers needs to be encouraged to enable this essential process to take place. 34 References Adams, V.

Introduction Acupuncture is one of three profession s, along with herbal medicine and Chinese medicine, which are jointly engaged in the process of working towards statutory regulation. The acupuncture profession is a complex mixture of full-time professional acupuncturists, statutorily regulated healthcare professionals who use acupuncture in their day-to-day practice, and a large number of users of clearly defined but limited techniques for specific therapeutic purposes. In the United Kingdom there is as yet no single body representing all acupuncturists, al though all of the main associations with histories of thirty or more year s representing the profession are now grouped under the aegis of the Acupuncture Stakeholders Group (ASG). This group, which operates by consensus decision, may well develop into a central reference point for the profession and the public after regulation. Acupuncture is a primary healthcare pr ofession, which emphasises, but is not limited to, the use of holistic traditional East-Asian medical theory, art and science to assess, diagnose and treat illness, injury, pain and other conditions. It makes use of safe and appropriate procedures taking into account individual variations in health status to promote, maintain or restore physical, psychological and social health and wellbeing. Acupuncturists work in a range of heal thcare settings, and operate both as independent practitioners and as members of integrated healthcare teams. The majority of full-time acupuncturist s work as self-employed individuals independently or in group practices. Statutory regulated healthcare professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and others) and substance-misuse workers, may use ac upuncture alongside or within their existing statutorily regulated activity in hospitals, community settings, GP practices or in the private sector. Acupuncturists often operate as independent healthcare professionals, fr om whom patients may seek direct care without referral from another healthcare professional, but will refer patients on where appropriate or liaise with other healthcare professionals where there is shared responsibility for patients. A distinctive feature of the practice of acupuncture is the ability of individual practitioners to use solid sterilised needles, which are inserted into specific tissues of the human body for disease prevention, therapy or maintenance of health. Various other techniques, both invasive and non-invasive, are often performed or prescribed with acupuncture. These allied techniques and modalities may include electrical and magnetic stimulation, moxibustion and other forms of heat therapy, sound, light and vibration therapy, cupping techniques, traditional East-Asian massage, lifestyle and dietary counselling, 43 exercise and breathing routines such as tai ji quan, qi gong, and acupressure. Acupuncture can be an effective treatment intervention as a sole treatment or as a supportive or adjunctive treatment to other medical treatments. Its practice is characterised by reflecti ve behaviour and systematic clinical reasoning, both contributing to, and underpinning, a problem-solving approach to patient-centred care. Acupuncture practice is supported and influenced by an increasing body of clinical research some of it of high-quality (see Appendix A). Whilst much of the research has been performed overseas, and may not always meet the rigorous standards of Western research, overall the body of evidence suggests widespread effectiveness of acupuncture in treating many disease states and conditions. Practice is informed by acupuncture-specific research as well as general scientific and medi cal literature (that includes traditional clinical experience extending back a millennium or more), and also by professional and clinical standards and clinical guidelines. In this way, the acupuncture profession engages in evidence-based practice. In the assessment, management, treatmen t and evaluation of an individual's needs, acupuncture practitioners will take into account the current physical, psychological, cultural and social factors and their influence on the individual's functional ability. Practice also takes into account, where appropriate, the needs and perspectives of other healthcare professionals in order to provide a coherent and ho listic approach that maximises independence and function. There are a number of accrediting bodi es within the United Kingdom. The range of courses which they accredit is broadly split into three groups: undergraduate degree-level, full-time acupuncture training; postgraduate training in Western medical acupuncture undertaken by regulated healthcare professionals; and short courses in defined uses of ear acupuncture and other micro-system treatment. Some acupuncture qualifying programmes are validated by independent accrediting bodies such as the British Acupuncture Accreditation Board, which was established in 1991 and singled out as an exemplar of best practice in the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology's Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (House of Lord's 2000). Many programmes are jointly validated by high er education institutions (HEIs) as BSc-degree and diploma programmes. Postgraduate and non-degree level training is also recognised by a variety of accrediting and validating bodies. The education of acupuncturists takes place within HEIs and in the private sector. HEI programmes are offered at honours-degree and postgraduate levels. Study may be full time or part time and programmes include a 44 practice component. Opportunities to study acupuncture are offered in at least 20 HEIs throughout the UK. 2. Nature and Extent of Acupuncture Acupuncture practitioners provide an important source of health and lifestyle advice to the public as well as many patient and client groups. They may also provide mentorship for students and colleagues and utilise a range of communication and teaching skills. Acupuncture is practised throughout the world and is recognised by the World Health Organization for its use in the treatment of a wide range of problems including muscular, neurological, digestive and respiratory disorders as well as urinary, menstrual, and reproductive problems (Xiaorui Zhang 2002). Acupuncture can be used to ease and resolve physical and psychological problems related to tension, stress and emotional conditions. The breadth and scope of acupuncture practice encompasses, but is not limited to, the following: The age span of human development from neonate to old age (acupressure is often employed in tr eating infants and young children). Individuals with complex and challenging problems resulting from multiple pathologies in chronic illness. Health promotion and injury prevention. The assessment, management and evaluation of treatment interventions. The therapeutic management and treatment of individuals with recovering conditions. The symptomatic treatment of individu als with deteriorating conditions s u c h a s i n t h e a r e a o f p a l l i a t i v e c a r e o r d e g e n e r a t i v e n e u r o l o g i c a l disorders to improve the quality of life. The supportive management of individuals with stable conditions such as medication-controlled illnesses. Working within a wide range of settings including private clinics, healthcare facilities, and peripatetic home visiting An understanding of the healthcare issu es associated with diverse cultures within society. Strengthening the body's resistance against disease - in traditional acupuncture this may be expressed in terms of nourishing and fortifying the individual's qi (vital energy), blood, yin and yang. Medical acupuncturists may express this proces s in terms of restoring homeostasis and improving the immune function. The acupuncture profession is a developi ng profession that operates within an ever changing and evolving healthcare and social environment. This growing profession continues to carry out pioneering work in formulating written practice standards and clinic al guidelines for a wide range of specialist areas. These standards make direct reference to evidence at 45 different levels and are embedded in practice and the curricula of undergraduate and postgraduate training programmes. Please note all but one of the organisations representing acupuncture endorsed this paper. There was one organisation that does not wish to be named, that had a contrary view abou t some of the aspects of the Annex. . 46 Position Summary on Acupuncture Education in the UK The seemingly simple task of delineating the current strands of UK acupuncture education is more complica ted than first appears to be the case. The situation is not much changed from the 2003 Acupuncture Regulatory Working Group Report (ARWG 2003); there is still a diversity of training and professional application of acupuncture skills in the UK. The current increased membership of the Acupuncture Stakeholders Group has only added to the mix. Outcome standards within this co ntext can only be judged as equivalent educational levels. Thus we have a spectrum ranging from a relatively simple certificate of competence to a Master s Degree. The key phrase in the ARWG executive summary was \" in the professional context within which they work\", indicating that the educational outcomes may not be the best way to understand differences in practice. There is a clear division between thos e who wish to become professional traditional acupuncturists and undertake a full UK-degree programme to accomplish this and those who, already trained in one of the regulated health professions within the NHS, wish to add a form of acupuncture as an intervention to be used within their profession's scope of practice. The acupuncture training for the second group will, of necessity, be of a postgraduate nature. The register will need to recognise these discrete groups. It would be possible to count the hours of training but wide variations in the quality, the proportions of taught to self-directed learning and, indeed, the precise aspects of the subjects encompassed makes this at best inaccurate and at worst misleading to members of the public. The following is a summary of the developing educational situation within the acupuncture profession and reflects th e diversity of styles and forms of delivery. It can be divided into three main categories; that of undergraduate provision leading to a recognised BSc in acupuncture offered by several universities in the UK ; that offered as a postgraduate Western Medical Acupuncture qualification, presently ranging from Certificate to MSc programmes, for statutory healthcare regulated professionals who hold recognised qualifications in medicine /dentistry/nursing/physiotherapy and other related medical disciplines within the National Health Service; and thirdly, training offered to non-medica lly qualified persons who have opted to undertake shorter, no n-academic courses. 1. BSc Acupuncture Qualification The undergraduate training validated and supervised by the British Acupuncture Accreditation Board (BAAB) is delivered through a number of UK universities and has thus been validated by both the UK advanced education system and the acupuncture professi onal body, the British Acupuncture Council (BAcC). 47 This, clearly, will form the qualification for a high proportion of acupuncture practitioners when the new register is opened and will fit easily with the basic standard required by the HPC. There is also a smaller group, represen ted by the Acupuncture Society, which currently runs a professional training course like the combined acupuncture and Chinese herbal course at the Coll ege of Chinese Medicine (CCM) which, although at degree level, is not yet linked to or validated by a university. 2. Additional Postgraduate Training This training is usually undertaken as a post registration qualification and may require different standards. Acupunc ture used by these professionals is premised on the scope of practice of the primary discipline and cannot be adequately offered without the basic professional qualification to support it. The appropriate acupuncture qualific ation, therefore, ranges from a certificate of competence to a university validated MSc. Most of this group are already working in the NHS and include doctors, physiotherapists, nurses and dentists. Since they are all, of necessity, already regulated by an existing body, the General Medical Council (GMC), the Health Professions Council (HPC), and the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) etc, the fundamental degree educational qualification is already subject to regulation. Another characteristic of the education for this group, particularly that of the doctors, nurse s and physiotherapists, is the emphasis on the research base, necessary to justify the use of acupuncture within the NHS. Recent work undertaken to formulate National Occupational Standards (NOS) has established professional acupuncture competences. Compliance with these is inherent in all the forms of training although it may be supported by different and profession-specific definitions of the knowledge and understanding of acupuncture required to practise. 3. Training Limited by Micro-System or Specific Application This category includes many of the ear-acupuncture practitioners, particularly those utilising the NADA (National Acup uncture Detoxification Association), five-point protocol for drug withdrawal, who have a limited focus and scope of treatment. The NOS competencies do not yet apply to these practices but there is no reason in principle why they should not eventually do so. Other practitioners, such as those in the Society of Auricular Acupuncture (SAA) or some in the Ear Acupuncture Register (EAR), also offer a more comprehensive system of ear acupuncture involving elements of diagnosis and therefore undergo a more extensive training approaching what might be described as a diploma level. 48 It has been suggested that the new register could perhaps look at extending the range of primary registrants to cover a category of diploma-level entrants for those whose work embraces elements of diagnosis, and also could establish a committee, or work with a profession-led committee, to accredit the training courses in defined-use acupuncture. The users of defined-use acupuncture could, in theory, operate as a voluntary self- regulating association, one proposal being that such an association might satisfy the criteria for the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health's (PFIH) proposed federal regulatory structure. ( http://www.fih.org.uk - Self- regulation for complementary therapies). An issue inextricably bound with educat ional standards is that of protected title. By and large those in the firs t group of professional acupuncturists require title, since this is their chosen profession, while those in the second group do not necessarily require the title itself but do need to be identified on the register of practitioners of acupuncture. Some may also choose to no longer remain registered with thei r statutory healthca re professional regulator, in which case they will certainly require title. A supplementary list for those practisi ng Western Medical Acupuncture could provide an answer, offering informatio n on the professional background of the practitioner and directing a complainant to the appropriate regulating body although this solution is not fa voured by either the British Academy of Western Medical Acupuncture (BAWMA) or the British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS). All practitioners consulted would like validation of their standards of practice by inclusion on a register. It has become apparent that the HPC favour a simple title, so \"acupuncturist\" may still be the best solution with some minimal information on the profession of the registrant included on the register. Regulation according to practice is equally complex and further complicated by the issue of dual regulation. The new term which has been coined for this is 'distributed regulation.' Current th inking seems to favour the primary regulator retaining jurisdiction over doctors, physiotherapists, nurses, dentists and other regulated healthcare professionals. In the case of physiotherapists, assuming, as seems likely, that the HPC will take on the role of regulatory body, no actual change may be necessary. In the longer term, this might well see the appearance of specialist lists on primary regulators for those meeting standards of acupuncture training and competence agreed between the primary regulator and a specialist committee within the acupuncture regulator. In the interim, however, if there is to be a register of practitioners using acupuncture, it would still be most logical, in the interests of patient pr otection, to have all those practising acupuncture, even if only as an adjunc tive technique, on the same list with the same title. Provision could be made on the acupuncture register site to 49 direct the enquiring patient to find appropriate regulatory details of an errant statutorily-regulated healthcare prof essional. NHS Trusts may ultimately request that all those providing acupunctu re seek registration for this skill. The third group of acupuncture users, the SAA, NADA, EAR and SMART may be encouraged to seek voluntary regulation after consultation with the PFIH as mentioned above. There is a strong desire within the Acupuncture Stakeholder Group that they remain at the 'table', however, in order that standards for the shorter courses are established, it is suggested that perhaps future qualifications could be \"kite marked\" in association with, or by, the acupuncture regulator. In conclusion, the following quotation from the ARWG Report, with one small addition, best sums up the current situation - ARWG Executive summary (ARWG 2003) ...[t]he Working group concluded that equivalence has to revolve around what a professional acupuncturist can be expected to do in the professional context within which they work. This would include the ability to synthesise information using a diagnostic framework and cover a wide scope of application. Comparisons will have to be made between differences in knowledge of areas such as Western medicine, acupuncture, patient management, practical skills and ethics , but always with reference to the independent practice of acupuncture...[and the safety of the patient]. 50 Standards of Proficiency for Acupuncture Practitioners 1a: Professional auton omy and accountability Registrant acupuncturists

While the TEAM practitioner representatives are aware that other standards of proficie ncy within HPC registered professions are perhaps more generic in style, they do nonetheless each specify what is specific to their particular therapy, and, consequently the level and scope of the acupuncture training required. Since the majority of registrants for the new acupuncture- and herbal-medicine regulator will probably, in the first instance, be TEAM practitioners, the current draft standards are written to provide a suitable benchmark for them which will not appear elsewher e in HPC documentation. The ASG is aware that the herbal-medicine practition ers have also produced standards of proficiency specific to herbal and traditional medicine. 57 References The Statutory Regulation of the Acupun cture Profession: The Report of the Acupuncture Regulatory Working Group , The Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health, London, 2003. http://www.fih.org.uk - Self-regulation for complementary therapies.

There are traditional medicine systems which also make use of non-plant ingredients alongside plant materials. The practice of herbal and traditional m edicine in the UK at the beginning of the 21 st century presents a varied landscape and includes the following categories (in alphabetical order): Ayurveda Chinese Medicine Kampo Traditional Tibetan Medicine Unani Tibb Western Herbal Medicine Within this variety there are some impo rtant shared characteristics and these are outlined in Part One. Part Two th en provides a brief account of those traditions which are currently represen ted in the UK. Each has a specific body of knowledge and skills, the ac quisition of which is essential for competent practice. It is also important to note that: Practitioners typically use other forms of treatment alongside herbal medicines. This is apparent in the Eastern traditions in which the use of medicinal substances appears as one modality amongst others. Here the use of the term traditional (as defined by the World Health Organisation 1) encompasses not only the use of non-plant ingredients but also a wide range of other treatment options. Likewise, in the field of Western herbal medicine, other forms of intervention such as dietary therapy and the use of essential oils internally and exte rnally are legitimate aspects of the work of the Western herbal practitioner. 1 WHO defines traditional medicine as follows: \"Traditional medicine is a comprehensive term used to refer both to TM systems such as traditional Chinese medicine, Indian ayur veda and Arabic unani medici ne, and to various forms of indigenous medicine. TM therapies include medication therapies \u2014 if they involve use of herbal medicines, animal parts and/or minerals \u2014 and nonmedication therapies \u2014 if they are carried out primarily without th e use of medication, as in the case of acupuncture, manual therapies and spiritual therapies\" Source WHO Traditional Med. Strategy 2002-2005 available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/ hq/2002/WHO_EDM_TRM_2002.1.pdf . 60 There is also an awareness of the importance of developing the evidence- base for herbal and traditional medicine. In one sense there is a wealth of evidence based on traditional use, including a rich literary and folk heritage. In the sense of an orthodox evidence-base, the bulk of research so far has been in the form of laboratory studies. However, there has been an increasing output of clinical research, including randomised controlled trials, and these have ge nerally been encouraging. It is recognised that much more needs to be done in this direction, while bearing in mind that the challenge is to establish research designs that are rigorous yet fait hfully reflect herbal and trad itional medicine as it is actually practis ed. See Annex 1 of the Steering Group report for further elucidation of this topic. Practitioners of herbal and traditio nal medicine work in a variety of settings; on their own or in larger group practices, in clinics attached to shops, and occasionally in orthodox settings such as specialist rehabilitation and HIV/AIDS centres. The great majority practise in the private sector, outside the NHS. Part One: Common Features Despite the great variety of traditions that have established a presence in the UK, there are a number of similar charac teristics. Beyond the obvious one of using plant substances as medicines, there are common themes in the understanding of the materia medica and in the approach to health and disease and to treatment. In this section the term ' materia medica ' is used generically, but it should be borne in mind that the materia medica of one tradition is to a very large extent distinct from that of others. Materia Medica The materia medica may be seen through the prism of traditional use, or through an understanding of the chemistry of the plant (or non-plant) ingredients and its impact on human physiology. According to the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products (Directive 2004/24/EC 2), the term 'traditional use' refers simply to usage over a certain time period (at least 30 years). Traditional use may apply to the use of herbal/traditional medicines in accordance with their intrinsically 'energetic' properties, for example, having warming, cooling or drying properties, or specific tastes such as sweet, sour, pungent, 2 Directive 2004/24/EC of 31 March 2004 (amending Directive 2001/83/EC), http://www.mhra.gov.uk/ home/idcplg?IdcService =SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=607 61 bitter, salty. They are assessed acco rding to their functional aspect - that is their ability to strengthen or support proper function, for example warding off infection, or correcting imbalances in digestion, respiration or urination, or to treat painful rheumatic conditions, or exercise a calming effect in anxiety disorders. Alongside the 'energetic' understanding of the materia medica a knowledge and understanding of the biochemistry of herbal and traditional medicines has developed, allo wing each tradition to draw on a substantial body of modern pharmacolo gical research to inform treatment decisions. Herbal and traditional medicines are complex in their chemical make-up by comparison with pharmaceutical drugs. This complexity may well confer advantages, because of the synergy that occurs between the plant constituents. It is also possible that components which are not active in themselves can function to improve the stability, solubility or bioavailability of others. The presence of multiple constituents can also create a buffering effect which contributes to safety. These sorts of advantage may be increased by the use of formulas containing multiple ingredients, which is the typical practice in every tradition. Many practitioners run their own pharmacies and this involves a further range of technical, safety and legal competencies. Some practitioners may also grow, harvest and prepare their own materials, though this is not required. Herbal and traditional medicines are ad ministered in a variety of forms, as teas (infusions or decoctions), tinc tures (alcohol extracts), powders, tablets or capsules, and in external applications including creams, ointments, plasters and compresses. Other forms of medicine that may be used include fermented substances (m edicinal wines) extract preparations such as juices and pastes, fatty preparations such as medicated ghees and oils, alkalis, ashes and syrups. Diagnosis and the Understanding of Disease Practitioners of herbal and traditional medicine carry out in-depth consultations, make independent diagnostic judgements and treat patients using prescriptions which are flexibly adjusted in the light of the patient's condition or following a change in diagnosis. Each tradition has, however, developed its own diagnostic framework which needs comprehensive separate stud y and clinical training. Practitioners take detailed case histories and use a variety of assessment methods. 62 Good health is viewed as a state in which energy is abundant and physiological functions are unimpeded. 'Energy' here appears in various guises as, for example, vital force , Qi or prana . 'Vitality ' is not tangible in the same way as physical or chemical energy, but there are agreed criteria for assessing it. The language of diagnosis, like the language that informs traditional use of the materia medica , is often couched in terms derived from the natural world. In energetic terms, pathogens (in the broad sense of disease-causing factors) include, for example, cold, heat, dampness and dryness. The humoural aspect, for example, the presence of excess mucus/catarrh or other forms of pathological dampness, appears as an important element in all traditions. Also, organ pathology tends to be viewed as a disruption of function (digestive, respiratory, urinary etc) rather than in terms of pathological changes in isolated body tissue. The focus of attention is less on disease as a specif ic entity, but more on the individual patterns of disharmony which can vary from person to person. These patterns are understood in a holistic way, resting on the assumption of a web of interconnectedness between physiological processes, and between mind and body. Treatment Treatment with herbal and traditional medicine is typically seen as a way of restoring balance and healthy function. Treatment may be aimed at assisting the expulsion of pathogens (understood broadly as disease-causin g factors) and/or addressing any underlying weakness whic h may have contributed to the condition. In some traditions there is a relatively strong emphasis on elimination as a means of restoring balance. In others this is given less prominence. However, all traditions use both eliminative (and 'clearing') and restorative (or 'tonifying') therapy, and attach importance to assessing the patient's constitution before deciding on the appropriate balance between the two. The skill of treatment with herbal and traditional medicine is to choose an ingredient, or more commonly a combination of ingredients, which matches the pattern of disharmony of the individual, and to modify this in order to accommodate changes in the course of treatment and, if necessary, make revisions to diagnosis. The range of conditions treatable with herbal and traditional medicine is very wide, and practitioners may be consulted about almost any condition that a conventional general practitioner might encounter. However, practitioners are trained to know the limits of their competence and to refer where necessary. 63 Part Two - Specific Features While there are important common features, each tradition embodies a large area of specific knowledge and skills, and proper acquaintance with these is essential for competent practice. 2.1 Ayurveda Ayurveda is a Traditional System of Medicine (TSM), recognised as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It originated in India and is today widely practised in India and Sri La nka as a government-recognised and statutorily regulated medical system. It is a comprehensive medical system based on a specific approach to anatomy, physiology, pathology and therapy, with classical specialist branches that include internal medici ne, ENT, ophthalmology, gynaecology, obstetrics, paediatrics, surgery, psyc hology and rejuvenation therapy. The term Ayurveda is derived from two Sanskrit words, ayus (meaning life) and vid (meaning knowledge). Ayurveda is thus also called the 'Science of Life', and it is as much concerned with preventing ill-health and enhancing quality of life, as it is with the actual treatment of disease. Ayurveda recognises the dynamic interplay of the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels in every individual and considers each manifestation of life to be inseparable from all other forms of life in the universe. Ayurveda is firmly embedded in Indian ph ilosophy and its theory of evolution, according to which the universe is composed of five basic elements. These are ether, air, fire, water and earth, which combine and manifest in living beings as so-called doshas . kapha , are the primary energetic forces of the human body. Each has its characteristic site and unique functions in the body. They are interrelated and, in their normal state, maintain the integrity of the living organism, conferring strength and assuring normal physiological functioning as well as longevity. Any imbalance of these forces results in ill-health. Ayurveda places particular emphasis on the individual constitution, prakriti , of every being, which is determine d by a unique combination of doshas , genetic factors as well as the health, nutrition and lifestyle of the parents prior to conception. Prakriti determines an individu al's susceptibility to different diseases and has an influence on the development and course of a disease as well as on the complications that could arise and the prognosis. An Ayurvedic practitioner takes a det ailed case history and arrives at a diagnosis through a variety of methods, including pulse or tongue reading 64 and other forms of body examination, an in-depth assessment of diet and lifestyle habits, and an analysis of mental and emotional states. The skill of the practitioner lies in assessing a patient's constitutional type, in diagnosing the root cause of imbalance that manifests as disease, and in selecting appropriate remedial interven tions from an array of therapeutic options. These include: nutrition and lifestyle therapy pharmacotherapy (use of drugs that are, traditionally, of plant, mineral and animal origin) panchakarma (detoxification therapy): a series of treatments that aim at deep body cleansing. They include elaborate preparatory procedures, emetic and purgative processes and also enema treatments. 3 rasayana (rejuvenation therapy): vari ous rejuvenating treatments that increase strength, immunity and overall vitality. manual therapy including massage and other forms of hands-on body work marma therapy (stimulation of energy points with pressure or solid needles) psychotherapy and counselling yoga and therapeutic exercise meditation and breathing techniques gem therapy and other forms of subtle energy work and healing. 2.2 Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine is one modality within the broad tradition of Chinese medicine, which also includ es acupuncture, massage ( tuina), breathing exercises ( qi gong ) and dietary therapy. In the great majority of cases practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine are also qualified in acupuncture-moxibustion and work with both modalities (as well as often with massage, dietary therapy or breathing exercises). Good health is seen as a state in which a person has optimum energy or vitality ( Qi) and in which the functions needed to maintain that vitality are unimpeded. Ill-health is due to a loss of vitality or to some form of impediment to those functions, or both. Good health furthermore requires a balance, represented by the core idea of Yin-Yang, a concept drawn from a school of thought which came to be central to the Chinese medical tradition. 3 Leeching, venesection and other forms of blood letting ( raktamokshan ) are also traditional practices of panchakarma and still performed today by suitably qualified practitioners 65 Diagnosis is the identification of a pa ttern of disharmony displayed by the individual patient, based on observation, listening, question ing and palpating. Particular attention is paid to the tongue and pulse in evaluating the patient's condition. A disharmony may be read as a deficiency or dysfunction in one or more of the Organs, in particular the Spleen, Liver, Heart, Lungs or Kidneys (these refer to spheres of function, and are not to be confused with the anatomical organs of modern medicine). Another perspective in diagnosis involves identifying patterns according to the presence of pathogenic factors. Such factors, which are not to be thought of as microbes, are described in terms derived from the natural world, namely heat, cold, dampness, wind, dryness, together with varieties of toxin and disease-causing products of the body described as blood stasis and phlegm. These patterns may have an external origin in climate or environment. For example, a damp house or damp working conditions may lead to a damp condition affecting the joints, a hot environment may aggravate a hot condition affecting the skin. Attention is also given to the origins of disease, broadly categorised as external, internal (relating mainly to the emotional sphere), neither external nor internal (including diet, imbalances of work and rest, and sexual factors) and a miscellany of others (including trauma, burns, bites and parasites). Inherited and congenital factors are also recognised. The Chinese materia medica contains several hundreds of plant species, together with some non-plant ingredients. These are classified according to their 'temperature', flavour, direction of movement, and properties that are related to their ability to supplement or clear impediments to function. The art of treatment with Chinese herbal medicine is to choose a formula (a combination of herbs) which matches the pattern of disharmony of the individual, and to modify the formula to accommodate changes in the course of treatment. 2.3 Traditional Tibetan Medicine Tibetan medicine is an ancient system of medicine with intricate theories of disease causation, diagnosis and therapeutics. The medical system itself is founded on the principle of mind, body and environmental factors interdependently creating the conditions for health or disease. Mind, body and external environment are all composed of the same basic five elements at greater or lesser degrees of subtlety. These five elemental principles are traditionally designated as earth, water, fire, air and space and may be interpreted as matter, bonding, energy, movement and space . This enables the components of the world at large to be used, by the physician, to restore the patient to heal th as both are of similar nature. The individual is a part of a greater whole. 66 One major factor believed to trigger di sease is the interaction between the person and the world in which (s)he lives - diet, human relationships and climate being typical areas of interaction. Tibetan medical practitioners are also trained to track the elemental characteristics of each moment and hour. The understanding of the timing of symptoms can give clues to the nature of the underlying disorder the person is ex periencing. Another factor is the influence of the individual's own mind , feelings and perso nal history. These factors affect the body and mind in multiple ways, grouped by Tibetan Medicine into three major areas of pathology, known as the nyes pa gsum. Each of these three areas includes functions of the body's major sub- systems, such as the cardiovascular system and digestive system. Each nyes pa is also related to the psychological makeup and welfare of the individual. The importance of compas sion in healing is stressed in Tibetan medicine. Diagnosis is principally based upon a complex analysis involving the following features: palpation of pulses to ascertain the state of the organs of the body, urine inspection, in-depth questioning to establish predisposing and precipitating causes of imbalance. Traditional Tibetan Medicine has develo ped an extensive range of clinical practice spanning psychiat ry, paediatrics, gynaecology, obstetrics, geriatrics and endocrinology as well as neurology. The system is complete in itself covering all aspects of health. Traditional Tibetan medicine makes use of the animal, vegetable and mineral components to restore health and balance and gives advice on how to heal the mind and improve the way in which one lives. Treatment is offered in the following areas: advice on certain behaviours to ad opt or avoid, since the way a person behaves can affect the subtle mind and more gross body elements and lead to health or disease dietary advice in order to help restore the elemental imbalance, as foods made up of the five elements can affect the body's balance of the elements the prescription of herbal and traditional medicines external treatments such as moxibustion 2.4 Western Herbal Medicine Western herbal medicine in the UK has a number of historical roots: The Graeco-Roman tradition The indigenous herbal culture of the British Isles North American herbal medicine Western medical science 67 The Graeco-Roman tradition is linked to the Hippocratic writings (4-5th century BC), to Dioscorides (1st century AD) and to Galen (2nd century AD), a tradition which laid the foundations for European (and Islamic) medicine until the modern era. The Hippocratic writings included herbal medicine, but they covered a much wider range of methods to encourage health, including diet and what would now be called lifestyle, environmental and psychotherapeutic measures. These writings contain some passages which sing the praises of physicians, but they emphasise the natural healing power of life ( vis medicatrix naturae ). This remains important in the practice of western herbal medicine, associated with an emphasis on gentle encouragement of physiological change as well as the treatment of symptoms. The influence of botanic medicine prac tised in North America on traditional herbal practice in the UK manifested particularly through the 19th century Eclectic and Physiomedical movements, which themselves incorporated much of the herbal knowledge and herbs of the Native Americans. As global communication and transportation expanded, plants from other parts of the world have been incorporated into the Western herbal framework. The American movements had reacted st rongly against the remedies of the 'regular physic' of the time (dominated by toxic minerals based on mercury, arsenic, antimony and sulphur), and emphasised the importance of physiological support or enhancement as well as physiological compensation. In enhancement, the goal is to create a state of active health, an optimum state of vitality. Like practitioners of other traditions, Western herbal practitioners assert the existence of a vital energy or vitality which integrates the normal functioning of the body and maintains homeostasis. This viewpoint gave rise to treatments aimed at increasing vitality by improving the function of individual systems/organs. However, where the pathological process has gone too far, or it is necessary to break a vicious circle of debilitating processes, compensation will be required, for example with the use of anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiseptic or anti-allergenic remedies. Western herbalists receive thorough tr aining in many aspects of modern medicine and integrate this knowledge wi th an understanding of the holistic, constitutional approach which is their heritage. Some herbalists grow and collect plant material to make their own medicines, and most prepare and dispense their own remedies. This involves running and maintaining dispensaries and thus skills in stock and quality control, health and safety and hygiene ar e essential, as of course are an in- depth knowledge of plant identification, and an understanding of cultivation methods, harvesting and conservation. 68 Standards of Proficiency for Herbal/Traditional Medicine Prac titioners Supplementary to HPC4 1.

We recommend that it is adopted, as published, for use by herbal/traditional me dicine practitioners . The emphasis on professional standards in advertising is relevant to herbal/tradit ional medicine. 1. General features to be taken into account: Investigating panels are made up of at least three people, including a chairperson, someone from the relevant profession and a lay person (someone who is not on the HPC register). It should be ensured that an appropriate herbal/traditional medicine practitioner should always be representative of the relevant tradition involved in the investigation. In regard to dealing with allegations against registrants, the HPC Standards of conduct, performance and ethics states \"We have set standards of conduct, performance and ethics, and also have standards of proficiency, and both of these can be relevant\" These interdependent documents are relevant to herbal/traditional medicine. Aspects of practice which are specifically referred to in the 75 current European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association's Code of Conduct e.g. dispensary management would be covered by the Standards of Proficiency . It should be noted that the generic Standards of Proficiency requirement for English and communication skills (1b3) says the following: o \"be able to demonstrate effective and appropriate skills in communicating information, advice, instruction and professional opinion to colleagues, service users patients, clients, users, their relatives and carers\". o \"be able to communicate in English to the standard equivalent to level 7 of the International English Language Testing System, with no element below 6.5\" (see Postscript 2 below). 2. Relevant matters from the HP C Standards of Proficiency: A. Generic standards are varied according to different professions The following two examples are taken from the consultation document on Standards of Proficiency . They show how the generic standards are applied to different professions. The prof ession-specific standa rd is in italics. Example 1: The skills required for the application of practice \"2b.4 be able to conduct appropriate diagnostic or monitoring procedures, treatment, therapy or other actions safely and skilfully Dramatherapist : - be able to use a range of dramatic concepts, techniques and procedures (including games, ac tivities, styles and structures) competently Paramedic: - ensure patients, clients and us ers service users are positioned (and if necessary immobilised) for safe and effective interventions\" Example 2: Knowledge, understanding and skills \"3a.1 know and understand the key co ncepts of the biological, physical, social, psychological and clinical sc iences bodies of knowledge which are relevant to their profession-specific practice Dramatherapist: - understand both the symbolic value and intent inherent in drama as an art form, and with more explicit forms of enactment and re-enactment of imagined or lived experience 3a.2 know how professional principles are expressed and translated into action through a number of different approaches to practice, and how to select or modify approaches to meet the needs of an individual, groups or communities 76 Paramedic: - be able to use the following airway management techniques, as well as knowledge of when and how each airway adjunct can be utilised to best effect: endotracheal tube placement, laryngeal mask airway, needle thoracocentesis, needle cricothyroidotomy\".

be able to work safely, including being able to select appropriate hazard control and risk management, reduction or elimination techniques in a safe manner in accordance with health and safety legislation - manage the dispensary with regard to the safety of staff and service users Discussion of some relevant poin ts pertaining to Standards of Professional Practice 1. Use of professional code to cover safe prescribing The 2004 MHRA consultation on Proposals for the reform of regulation of unlicensed herbal remedies in the United Kingdom made up to meet the needs of individual patients 1 asks: Do you agree on the central importance of requiring systematic professional accountability for those who wish to benefit from the exemption in s12(1)? Do you agree that best overall appr oach to improving s12(1) would be through a combination of updated medicines legislation and agreement with the profession on codes of practice? For the herbal/traditional medicine pr ofession, these proposals represent the best scenario as codes of practice would remain profession-led. Use of the professional code should promote safe practice and it should be possible for practitioners to be regularly updated, and advised to follow guidance promptly when new safety issues emerge. For this reason, a duty to have email access is added under 2b of the Standards of Proficiency (see above). Detailed guidance on safe practice via the HPC should be informed by professional associations in regular cons ultation with the HPC. For reference, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) has several guidance documents on safe practice published on its website ( http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/ ). For comparison, the RPSGB code gives more detail than the HPC Code: for example on Extemporaneous Preparation/Compounding (See Postscript 4 below for RPSGB Code on this matter The RPSGB guidance for prescribing ph armacists states that, as far as possible, the pharmacist should not both prescribe and dispense. However, it is common practice for herbal/traditional medicine practitioners both to prescribe and to dispense or to supervi se dispensing and this is unlikely to change. Therefore at 2b5 of the Standards of Proficiency we have added the phrase \"to implement procedures for record-keeping in the dispensary so 80 that a full audit trail of all herbal medicines is possible.\" The Foster Report states that single-handed or lone practitioners may present more risk in healthcare2. Single-handed practice emphasises the need for good record- keeping. 2. Face to face consultation under 12(1) The MHRA's discussion paper Reforms of s12(1) of the Medicines Act 1968: the requirement for a fa ce to face consultation (8 Jan 07) suggests retaining the requirement for a face-to-face consultation3. Such a consultation and any relevant examination should be conducted in private. The requirement for a consultation shou ld not include a conversation over- the-counter in shop with the possible exception of the arrangement for treatment of minor ailments via s pecialist outlets described below. Item 8 of the HPC code for Standards of Conduct, Performance and Ethics dealing with \"duties as a registrant\" calls on registrants to \"effectively supervise tasks you have asked others to carry out for you.\" It should also be noted that the current RPSGB code covers pharmacy technicians as well as pharmacists. In the light of these arrangements, it may perhaps be possible to develop codes for supervision by registered herbal/traditional medicine practitioners of staff in specialist outlets providing a service for treating minor, self-limiting ailments going beyond the sale of registered traditional medicinal products (license d traditional medicine products under the THMPD are designed to be sold directly to the public for the treatment of minor, self-limiting conditions without the need for intervention by a health professional). It should, however, be borne in mind that there are some complex issues to be resolved here including the blurring of boundaries between the professional and retail sectors, the possible undermining of retail outlets marketing traditionally re gistered or licensed medicinal products and of registered practitioners themselves, and the need to comply with the regulations applying to industrially made products under Directive 2001/83/EC. Lastly, prescribing arrangements by herbalists/traditional medicine practitioners would also evidently need to include guidance on repeat prescriptions. The MHRA consultation document refers to the General Medical Council guidance on remote prescribing 4. Another relevant document is the RPSGB Code of Prescribing Pharmacists: \"Guidance on remote prescribing via telephone, email, fax, video link or website\" (Postscript 4 below). 3. Conclusion Wording of profession-specific standards is a form of risk management. Risks must be identified, assessed for probab ility and monitored. Bearing in mind the requirements of the HPC Standards of Proficiency as laid down in 1a8 \"understand both the need to keep ski lls and knowledge up to date and the 81 importance of career-long learning\" the following aspects of herbal practice should be included in this process. Consultation, including clinical history, clinical examination and diagnosis (according to specific tradition). Appropriate advice and, where necess ary, referral to another health professional. Prescribing herbal medicines of assured quality, prepared in a clean, orderly dispensary, with accurate labelling. Herbal medicines should be prescribed in the light of current knowledge (both traditional and modern). Care of the patient to be maintained throughout the treatment period. Any change of clinical circumstance should be monitored by the responsible herbal/traditional m edicine practitioner leading to appropriate changes to prescr ibing/ advice or referral. Where required these aspects of practice can specifically be covered in the Standards of Proficiency ( e . g . P a r a m e d i c s h a v e a l o n g l i s t o f required skills). Particular emphasis is required on prescribing, responsibility for repeat prescribing, dispensary management and preparation of herbal medicines.

Postscript 2 Communication in English (e xcerpt from the generic HPC Standards of Proficiency ) 1b: Professional relationships Registrants must: 1b.4 be able to demonstrate effe ctive and appropriate skills in communicating information, advi ce, instruction and professional opinion to colleagues, service user s patients, clients, users, their relatives and carers - be able to communicate in English to the standard equivalent to level 7 of the International English Language Testing System, with no element below 6.5 - understand how communication skills affect the assessment of patients, clients and users, serv ice users and how the means of communication should be modified to address and take account of factors such as age, physic al and learning disability - be able to select, move between and use appropriate forms of verbal and nonverbal communication with patients, clients, service users and others - be aware of the characteristics and consequences of non-verbal communication and how this can be affected by culture, age, ethnicity, gender, religious belief s and socio-economic status - understand the need to provide patients, clients and service users (or people acting on their behalf) with the information necessary to enable them to make informed decisions Postscript 3 Outtake from RPSGB Professional Standards and Guidance for the Sale and Supply of Medicines (section 4) Extemporaneous Preparation or Compounding (Nov 07) This standard is not intended to cover the reconstitution of dry powders with water or other diluents. The public is entitled to expect that products extemporaneously prepared in a pharmacy are prepared accurately and are suitable for use. If you wish to be involved in extemporaneous prepa ration you must ensure that: 4.1 A product is extemporaneously prepared only when there is no product with a marketing authorisation ava ilable and where you are able to prepare the product in complian ce with accepted standards. 83 4.2 You and any other staff involved are competent to undertake the tasks to be performed. 4.3 The requisite facilities and equipment are available. Equipment must be maintained in good order to ensure that performanc e is unimpaired, and must be fit for the intended purpose. 4.4 You are satisfied as to the safety and appropriateness of the formula of the product. 4.5 Ingredients are sourced fr om recognised pharmaceutical manufacturers and are of a quality accepted for use in the preparation and manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Where appropriate, relevant legislation must be complied with. 4.6 Particular attention and care is paid to substances which may be hazardous and require special handling techniques. 4.7 The product is labelled with the necessary particulars, including any special requirements for the safe handling or storage of the product, and an expiry date and any special requirements for the safe handling or storage of the product. 4.8 If you are undertaking large-scale preparation of medicinal products, all relevant standards and guidance are adhered to. 4.9 Records are kept for a minimum of two years. The records must include: the formula, the ingredients, the quantities used, their source, the batch number, the expiry date where the preparation is dispensed in response to a prescription, the patient's and prescription details and the date of dispensing. the personnel involved, including the identity of the pharmacist taking overall responsibility. Postscript 4 Outtake from RPSGB Professional Standards and Guidance for Pharmacist Prescribers ( section 3.6) \"Guidance on remote prescribing via telephone, email, fa x, video-link or website (Nov 07) \"From time to time it may be appropriate to use a telephone or other non face-to-face medium to prescribe medicines and treatments for patients. Such situations may occur where: You have responsibility for the care of the patient You are providing out of hours or urgent care services You are working in remote and rural areas You have prior knowledge and understanding of the patient's condition and medical history You have authority to access th e patient's records and you are working as a supplementary prescr iber, but the doctor / dentist 84 required to authorise the clinic al management plan works at a distance You must carry out an adequate risk asse ssment for each individual case of remote prescribing. Records of remote prescribing including the reasons for prescribing in this manner should be made.\" August 2007 Note from the Herbal/Traditional Me dicine Stakeholder Group on the Relevance to herbal and traditiona l medicine practitioners of The Health Professions Council (HPC) do cument Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Definition The HPC defines CPD as: \"a range of learning activities through which health professionals maintain and develop throughout their career to ensure that they retain their capacity to practice safely, effectively and legally within their evolving scope of practice\" The Herbal/ Traditional Medicines Stakeh olders Group agrees that this seems to be a good definition that the herbal/traditional medicine can adopt. CPD and Compulsion CPD is a compulsory requirement for ongoing registration with the HPC: it seems clear that CPD must be compulsory for the Herbal/ Traditional Medicines sector too. Requirements of Practitioners According to the HPC practitioners must: - maintain a continuous, up-to-date and accurate record of their CPD activities; - demonstrate that their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activities relevant to current or future practice; - seek to ensure that their CPD has contributed to the quality of their practice and service delivery; - seek to ensure that their CPD benefits the service user; - present a written portfolio containing evidence of their CPD upon request. Regarding what constitutes \"evidence\" the HPC says: A range of evidence can be used, for ex ample, letters from users, personal development plans, course assignments, business plans, learning contacts or guidance material, peer assessment forms, learning packages, workshop attendance and reflections, learning and reflections on dissemination of research/publications. 85 Further advice from the HPC: You will be required to complete a portfolio which is a complete record of your CPD activities over a two year period and this should: Be updated regularly Focus on a two-year period Be accurate and reflect the activities undertaken. Should you be selected for audit, you will be required to submit a profile as a demonstration that your CPD activities have met the Standards. The profile will consist of: A summary of practice history for the last two years (maximum 500 words) A statement of how the CPD Standards have been met (maximum 1500 words) Evidence to support your statement. According to the HPC: Standard 2 - A registrant must demon strate that their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activiti es relevant to current or future practice. Your CPD should include 'a mixture of learning activities'. We do not need you to undertake a certain amount of CP D (for example, to do a number of hours or days). This is because we believe that different people will be able to dedicate different amounts of time to CPD, and also because the time spent on an activity does not necessarily reflect the learning gained from it. Under this standard, your CPD must include a mixture of learning activities - so you should include different types of learning activity in your CPD record. The full HPC standards for CPD are: Standard 1 - A registrant must maintain a continuous, up-to-date and accurate record of their CPD activities. Standard 2 - A registrant must demonstrate that their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activities relevant to current or future practice. Standard 3 - A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD has contributed to the quality of their practice and service delivery. Standard 4 - A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD benefits the service user. Standard 5 - A registrant must present a writte n profile containi ng evidence of their CPD upon request . How is CPD checked? According to the HPC: When you renew your registration , you declare that you have undertaken CPD, maintained a record of that CPD and have met the standards. You must 86 also sign the declaration that you continue to practise and include the relevant fee. If we find that you have not met the necessary standards, we will give you a further opportunity to meet them within a prescribed time limit so long as you have made a genui ne attempt to meet those standards. If you fail to meet those standards within the set time, we may remove you from the Register (although yo u have a right of appeal). The onus is on the practitioner to \"self-certify\". This is an adult approach that empowers the individu al. An individual practitioner's CPD profile can be checked at any time. The HPC randomly sample practitioners to audit CPD (i.e. to check if they have done it). The sample size is between 5 and 2.5% of the membership 5. Specific Details: The CPD Standards process The overall CPD Standards process will operate by: - each registrant making a self-declaration at each registration renewal that they continue to meet the Council's Standards for CPD; - sample audits of registrants taken at random from each section of the register; - submission of a profile of evidence by registrants selected for sample audit; - iv) assessment of profile against the Standards of CPD using appropriate and experienced partners. Number of Hours/Points Required The HPC does not have a set number of hours or points required for CPD. At first sight this seems odd but when one starts to question how exactly you might weight points or how many hours of self- study might be equivalent to a number of hours for attending a seminar (for example) one sees how it can be very hard to quantify. Essentially the HPC scheme trusts that practitioners are active, responsible and committed to thei r own professional progress. This is an adult and professional appro ach that places emphasis on the individual practitioner to take cha rge of his/her own development. Consequences of Failing to Meet CPD Requirements According to the HPC: The Education and Training Committee , which is a statutory committee of Council, has the responsibility for registration and re-registration, has the right to refuse to renew a registra nt's registration or may direct the 5 The first HPC CPD audit will no t take place until July 2008. 87 Registrar to remove the registrant's name from the Register. This is under article 10(2) (b) of the Health Professions Order, 2001. This seems appropriate and something we could accept. Clearly there must be consequences for failing to keep up CPD. What is Classed as CPD? The HPC favours an approach to CPD that is flexible and non-prescriptive. According to the HPC: The range of CPD learning activity is extensive and includes: - work-based learning. For exampl e, reflective practice, clinical audit, significant event analysis , user feedback, membership of a committee, journal club; - professional activity. For exampl e, member of specialist interest group, mentoring, teaching, expert witness, presentation at conferences; - formal/educational. For example, courses, undertaking research, distance learning, planni ng or running a course; - self-directed learning. For reading journals/articles, reviewing books/articles, updati ng knowledge via www/TV/press; - other activities. For ex ample, public service. Further guidance from the HPC as examples of CPD activity: Registrant working in a clinical role Attending a short course on new laws affecting your work Appraising an article with a group of colleagues Giving colleagues a presentation on a new technique Registrant working in education Being a member of a learni ng and teaching committee Doing a review for a professional journal Studying for a form al teaching award Registrant working in management Being a member of an occupational group for managers Studying management modules Supporting the development and introduction of a national or local policy Registrant involved in research Giving a presentation at a conference Being a member of a local ethics research committee Considering articles fo r scientific journals When setting our standards for CPD, we realise that health professionals are already undertaking a wide range of CPD activities as part of their professional life. Our standards are not designed to increase the workload of health professionals registered with us , but to recognise the activities they are already undertaking. 88 The Herbal/ Traditional Medicine Stakeholder Group appreciate such a broad approach. There is also scop e for an individual to include an activity that is not on this li st as CPD. This scheme enables practitioners to tailor an individu al CPD profile to meet their own learning and practice needs. How is CPD Measured? According to the HPC: In determining the Standards for CPD, the Council recognise that registrants are already engaged in a diverse range of CPD activities as an integral part of their professional life. Some CPD activities are opportunistic and are taken on as an evolving component of working life. Following the response to the 2002 Consultation, the Council decided that the proposed scheme for CPD should not be based simply on the number of hours undertaken each year. The scheme should be based upon on-going learning and development, with a focus on individuals' learning achievements and how these enhance service delivery, either directly or indirectly. The HPC provides details of how the CPD standards are assessed in their guidebook, Continuing Professional Development and your Registration. CPD assessors According to the HPC: CPD assessors play a vital role in making sure the audit process runs smoothly. They are one type of what we call 'partners'. Other types of partner that we currently use inclu de registration asse ssors, who make decisions about applications from people who trained outside the UK, and panel members who consider allegations and complaints about registrants. When recruiting our CP D assessors we will: - make sure we advertise openly for the roles; - produce a shortlist of those who have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience; and - interview all those shortlisted to make sure we have an appropriate number of CPD assessors drawn fr om a range of professional backgrounds. We will then train CPD assessors to make sure they carry out their jobs fairly (and we will put information about how to become a CPD assessor on our website when we begin recruiting). On ce CPD audits are underway, we will review the performance of CPD assessors to make sure decisions are being made consistently as far as possible. Who Delivers CPD? The HPC does not \"organise, certify or manage CPD activities\". Given the range of activities that can constitute CPD, the number of providers is very broad and includes th e practitioner themselves (e.g. they may prescribe a course of reading for themselves). 89 Clearly CPD providers will also include professional bodies, academic institutions and private CPD providers who might arrange activities such as professional seminars. Can One Take a Break from CPD? According to the HPC: We agreed... to take account of the fact that many registrants need to take a break in their practice in order to, for example, care for children or other relations. From 2008, we will be random ly auditing registrants to ensure that they meet our CPD standards and, if you are on a two year break from practice when you are audited, you can write to us and request that your audit be deferred, if you wish. Then, when you begin practising again, you can re-commence your CPD, and keep a record of it, ready for when you are audited the next time (which would happen automatically after a deferral). If you are out of practice for more than two years, then we recommend that you should come off the Register, and reapply for registration when you wish to practise again. While you are not registered, there are obviously no CPD requirements for you to fulfill. When you apply for re-registration, if you have been out of practice for more than two years, you will need to complete an updating period of 30 days before you apply. If you have been out of practice for more than five years, you will need to complete an updating period of 60 days before you apply. This updating period can be made up of any combination of supervised practice, formal study or private st udy, providing that private study comprises no more than half of the whole period. The H/TMSG agrees with this approach. In addition, the H/TMSG makes the following points: regarding CPD and Competence - CPD is not taken as a guarantee of competence. Other activities may need to be engaged in to prove this. regarding CPD and Revalidation The HPC says this: - The process whereby a registered pr ofessional is regularly assessed to make sure that they are fit to practise. (This is not the same as CPD, which is concerned with ongoing development and learning.) The H/TMSG comments: - The probable future requirem ents for regulated herbal practitioners to be revalidated are still unclear. No detail is 90 yet available. It seems certai n however that it will be a separate process to CPD. The Relationship of CPD to Fitness to Practice The HPC says: - Although within our legislation (Health Professions Order, 2001) there is no automatic link between CPD and fitness to practise (Part V of the Order), if your actions in relation to CPD amount to misconduct (for example making a false declaration or falsifying CPD records) this will lead to your fitness to practise being investigated. If, as a result, you are struck off the Register, you cannot apply to be registered again for at least five years. CPD and Professional Bodies The HPC has this to say (presented in a \"Frequently Asked Question\" style): - I do not wish to become a member of my professional body who I know offer their own CPD courses and programmes. What is the best way to meet the HPC requirements for CPD without becoming a member of my professional body? - You do not have to be a member of a professional body in order to meet the HPC's Standa rds for CPD. In terms of the types of CPD activities, we have produced a suggested list (which is not exhaustive) from which you may wish to select those which best meet your needs. You may also choose to be a member of your own profe ssional body and meet those requirements. This is at your own discretion and does not affect or influence your HPC registration. We have been told that one of the roles for professional bodies post- regulation will be the provision of CPD. There is no mandatory requirement, however, for practitione rs to take up professional body CPD . Clearly it will be down to pro fessional bodies to make their CPD so attractive that practitioners will wish to choose it. Comparisons The General Medical Council is mu ch more specific than the HPC as regards the content of CPD - specifyi ng, but not limiting, the kind of areas that CPD should cover. The HPC CPD scheme is broadly in accordance with the \"Ten Principles for Continuing Professi onal Development\" given by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (Postscript 1), though they do quantify the amount of CPD credits required (equivalent to 50 hours spent on CPD per year). 91 CPD and the White Paper: Trust, Assurance and Safety - The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century5. There is only one mention of CPD in the Paper: 23. The Government recognises the gains to be secured from single oversight of medical education, but believes that change should be introduced in such a way as to preserve the expertise and experience of the present organisations that undertake this role. The Government agrees with the proposal, set out in the GMC's response to consultation, for a three-board model covering undergraduate education, postgraduate education and continuing professional development. The Department will work with the GMC to establish an undergraduate board and a continuing professional development board in the GMC. The Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board will continue as a separate legal entity, fulfilling the role of the postgraduate board within this three-board. Conclusion and Recommendations from the H/TMSG The HPC CPD policy is clear and well supported by documents that effectively explain the process to practitioners. The scheme is innovative and flexible and should easily provide scope for herbal/ traditional medicine practitioners to build a mixed CPD portfolio as the HPC requires. Whilst some of the CPD options might be more readily available for practitioners working in employed NHS settings there remain a wide range of op tions suitable for self-employed independent practition ers to utilise. There is also scope for practitioners to provide a rational e for any extra CPD activities they can identify which are not already listed. CPD assessors will need to be sensitive to the work of herbal and traditional medicine practitioners but no significant problems are anticipated since the assessment process is essentially generic. Attainment of appropriate CPD status would not appear to be at all onerous. In fact some might critic ise the scheme for being a little too open and non-prescriptive. Certainl y there would seem to be nothing here about which the herbal/tradition al medicine sector should have concerns. CPD does not demonstrate competen ce and this is a major limitation of the concept. The nature and extent of CPD can vary greatly from one individual to another. The em erging emphasis on revalidation responds to the need to prove on going competence - something CPD cannot provide. The relationship between CPD and revalidation will be one to watch as time goes on. 92 The HPC CPD scheme should not pre sent a major extra workload for herbal/traditional medicine practitio ners- for the most part it should be simply a case of recording what is already being done. The H/TMSG recommends the acceptance of this scheme as it stands.

CPD www.gmc-uk.org Postscript 1 Academy of Medical Royal Colleges PRINCIPLES FOR COLLEGE/FACULTY CPD SCHEMES 1. An individual's CPD activities should reflect and be relevant to their profile of professional practice an d performance. This should include continuing professional development outside narrower specialty interests. 2. CPD should include activities both within and outside the employing institution (where there is one) and a balance of learning methods which include a component of active le arning. Participants will need to collect evidence to record this pr ocess, normally using a structured portfolio cataloguing the different activities. This portfolio will be available for appraisal and revalidation. 3. College/Faculty CPD schemes should be available to all members and fellows and, at reasonable cost , to non-members and fellows who practise in a relevant specialty. 4. Normally, credits given by Colleges /Faculties for CPD should be based on one credit equating to one hour of participation. The minimum required should be an average of 50 per year. Credits for un-timed activities such as writing, reading an d e-learning should be justified by the participant or should be agreed between College/Faculty directors of CPD. 5. Participation in College/Faculty based CPD schemes should be acknowledged by a regular statement issued to participants based on annually submitted returns. 6. In order to quality assure their CPD system, Colleges/Faculties should fully audit participants' activities on a random basis. Such peer-based audit should verify that claimed activities have been undertaken and are appropriate. Participants will need to collect evidence to enable this process. 7. The proportion of participants involved in random audit each year should be of a size to give confidence that it is representative and will vary according to the number of participants in a given scheme. 8. Self-accreditation of relevant activities and documented reflective learning should be allowed and encouraged. Formal approval of the quality of educational activities for CPD by Colleges/Faculties should be 93 achieved with the minimum bureaucr acy and with comp lete reciprocity between Colleges/Faculties for all approved events. 9. Self-accreditation of events will require evidence. This may be produced as a brief reflective no te. Formal CPD certificates of attendance at meetings will not be a requirement. Other evidence of attendance should be provided, as determined by each individual College or Faculty. Signed registers are only necessary where there is no other available evidence of attendance. 10. Failure when challenged to prod uce sufficient evidence to support claimed credits will result in an individual's annual statement being endorsed accordingly for the year involved and the individual subsequently being subject to audit annually for a defined period. Suspected falsification of evidence for claimed CPD activities may result in referral to the GMC/GDC. Suggestions for Protected titles: From Herbal/Traditional Medicine Stakeholders Group The H/TMSG is of the opinion that there are still many matters to be resolved over the question of titles and notes that the European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Association wishes to continue discussions on this subject with the DH and HPC post publication of th ese Steering Group and Stakeholder Groups' reports. Table 1 below indicates some possib le titles proposed by the H/TMSG for further discussion: GENERIC TRADITION TITLE Herbal/Traditional Ayurveda Ayurvedic Practitioner Medicine Practitioner Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Chinese Herbal Medi cine Practitioner Traditional Tibetan Medicine Traditional Tibetan Medicine Practitioner Unani Tibb Unani Tibb Practitioner Western Herbal Medicine Herbalist Western Herbal Medi cine Practitioner Medical Herbalist 94 National Professional Stan dards for Herbal Medicine The following are excerpts describi ng the training, knowledge and activity of professional herbalists/t raditional practitioners in the western, Chinese and Tibetan traditio ns originally published in July 2003.

Enquiri es should be addressed to the European Herbal & Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association Ltd. 122 Introduction This document contains the common-core curriculum of the European Herbal & Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association Education Committee. It is the result of wide consultation between the various herbal traditions to determine the shared components of herbal practice and the content necessary to provide education and training in those components. The core curriculum is applicable to all education/training programmes offering study of herbal medicine. In addition, there are separate modules which identify the requirements of each specific traditional form of practice, formally referred to as the 8 th Elements. The core curriculum is part of a wider process of accreditation and forms the skeleton around which the delivery of a programme leading to the practice of herbal medicine should take place. As such it delineates the minimum outcomes that should be achieved by students. In terms of content, institutions are encouraged to go beyond those specified here in the detailed delivery of the programmes they offer. It is recognized that each institution would wish to retain its own identity and unique emphasis. The common curriculum therefore aims at making the requirements specific, while retaining the flexibility for each institute to incorporate the contents into their own curriculum design. The Accreditation Board encourages institutions to develop their programmes within the framework of the core curriculum and to justify their approach against its requirements. Note however, that in all cases, the majority of programme content must reflect the specif ic tradition being accredited. The demanding of minimum programme-co ntent requirements is part of a process of accreditation by which the EHTPA can ensure competent, safe, effective practitioners aware of the breadth and limitations of herbal medicine practice. Contents The core curriculum consists of the following nine modules: Module 1. Human Sciences Module 2. Nutrition Module 3. Clinical Sciences Module 4. Plant Chemistry and Pharmacology Module 5. Pharmacognosy and Dispensing Module 6. Practitioner Development and Ethics Module 7. Practitioner Research Module 8. Tradition specific curriculum content * Module 9. Clinical Practice 123 * Module 8 identifies tradition specific content which must be included by any given institution into their chosen curriculum. Mandatory curriculum content for each tradition is produc ed by the appropriate professional body/ies. Study Time The following table gives the minimum number of hours to be incorporated into the programme to be accredited. MODULE HOURS Human Sciences 250 Nutrition 80 Clinical Sciences 350 Plant Chemistry and Pharmacology 80 Pharmacognosy and Dispensing 100 Practitioner Development and Ethics 150 Practitioner Research 150 Clinical Practice (under review) 500 The Specific Herbal Tradition 1,150 TOTAL 2,810 Within these minimum totals, the relationship between contact hours and home-study hours will depend on the design of the programme and the previous learning and experience of the st udents. It is for each Institution to justify in educational terms the hours allocated within modules and teaching/learning approaches used. In the case of the clinical-practice modu le, it is required that 50% or more of the module hours will be spent on clinical work in direct proximity to patients. Remaining clinical hours may consist of case discussions, elaborating diagnoses, researching treatments, writing up cases, and other clinically relevant activities. NB. All clinical practice hours must be undertaken in an approved clinical learning environment, under the direction of the Clinic Supervisor and directly relate to the achievement of the clinical module learning outcomes. 124 Levels Each module of the core curriculum is assigned a minimum level using a taxonomy of assessment domains. The use of minimum levels allows institutions some flexibility in curriculum design and in the educational nature of their programmes. The levels refer to the National Qualifications Framework of the Quality Assurance Agency. Assessment Each institution is required to present an assessment strategy for the programme as a whole, alongside a detailed account of the assessment process for each module. The EHTPA does not impose any particul ar assessment techniques but will seek evidence from the institution to ensure that: Module learning outcomes are assessed; Assessment techniques reflect the academic level of each module; A variety of strategies are used; Both formative and summative assessment is incorporated within modules; Practice is underpinned by relevant theory; Students failing to progress satisfactorily are identified and remedial help given; Only safe competent practitioners complete the programme; Clinical progression from novice to competent practitioner can be demonstrated; Assessment is carried out by suitably qualified and experienced assessors. Students are expected to develop the ability to deal confidently with the complexities and contradictions that aris e in clinical practice. Students must show awareness of the ethical dilemmas which may occur in their work, and must be able to formulate solutions to these. Documentation for the assessment of practice should clearly demonstrate that clinical skills are performed consistently and with confidence. Criteria for success and failure should be made explicit.

Stationery Office, London 146ANNEX 4 Standards of Proficiency for Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners The Chinese Medicine Working Group was set up by the Department of Health as an attempt to draw together the different arms from within the Chinese medical community and develop common standards. This group worked together for nearly three years and produced the following policies which all met with broad acceptance. (a) Code of professional conduct. (b) Code of practice. (c) Standards of conduct, performance and ethics. (d) Core curriculum for educational institutions. They also endeavored to find common ground for the membership of different organisations and worked together to develop some clear messages which could eventually be used to help Western medical professionals understand th e contribution that TCM could make to public health. The Chinese Medicine Working Group is still going through \"growing pains\" and it is anticipated that the direction and discipline of statutory regulation will help the members of the group appreciate the need and, more importantly, the value of collective responsibility. This will ensure that the major efforts all members have made will not be lost but rather will serve as a springboard for the acceptance of this traditional medicine. It is recognised that the issue of English language standards for practitioners is a major sticking point and the members of the group look forward to the opportunity of discussing with the appropriate regulatory body what options may be available to ensure that the experience of so many Chinese TCM practitioners is not lost. 1.

Acceptance of this assumption means that it is incumbent upon each Accreditation Board to provide evidence that it has robust and effective procedures in place before transfer of practitioners onto the Statutory Register can occur. Each Accreditation Board wishing to enable the transfer of herbal/traditional medicine or acupuncture practitioners onto the Statutory Register should provide do cumented evidence of Accreditation- Board systems and processes and their effectiveness to the Regulator for consideration and approval. Such documentation should: Include organisational structure and reporting mechanisms; constitution; membership and terms of reference; minutes of key meetings for the preceding three years; board annual report for the preceding three years; proof that the Accreditation Board has been operating professionally for three years Demonstrate how the independence of the Accreditation Board's decision making process is mainta ined and undue influence from educational and/or commercial institutions avoided Include names of Accreditation Bo ard staff and honorary officers (with procedure for appointment and removal) Provide details of all institutions currently accredited, with dates initial accreditation achieved Include accreditation criteria/educational standards and evidence of their transparency Include three complete documentary audit trails from accredited institutions, each to include the initial stages of scrutiny, eventual accreditation and subsequent annual review Include appeal procedures 157 158ANNEX 7 Grandparenting Criteria for recommending voluntar y registers for direct transfer to the Health Professions Council for acupuncture, herbal/traditional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine where there is evidence that the public safety would not be at risk. This is a copy of the document sent in the summer of 2007 by the Steering Group to Professional Associ ations representing practitioners using herbal medicines or acupuncture . The document sought information regarding criteria used for recommending voluntary registers to the Health Professionals Council (HPC) for direct transfer of their members to the HPC. Introduction The attached criteria have been agreed by the Department of Health (England) Working Group for the statutory regulation of acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine for the purposes of recommending that members of a voluntary regulatory body be automatically transferred to the statutor y register when it is established. The criteria have deliberately been se t to a high level and it is possible that professional associations that do not meet these may, nevertheless, be considered acceptable by the Health Professions Council which is most likely to be the future statutory regula tory body for these professions. Professional associations are invited to submit evidence to the Working Group that they meet the attached criteria. Information should be provided no later than 10 July 2007. 159 Criteria 1. The register should have been effectively operated for a minimum period of 5 years. Similarly the organisation hosting the register should also have been in existence for at least 5 years prior to the opening of the new statutory register. 2. The organisation hosting the register, whether a single register or a federated organisation should be established and a membership organisation able to speak with a unified voice. 3. The organisation hosting the regist er should have evidence of (a) a code of ethics informing a code of conduct, (b) clear definitions and expectations of educational standards and outcomes (c) demonstrably effective arrangements for the accreditation of educational programmes, (d) evidence of policies and procedures that would facilitate removal of individuals from a register, (e) evidence that the register recognises the importance of continuing professional development and encourages members to remain professionally up- to-date and (f) involvement of lay members on key committees or have lay input. 4. With regard to accrediting educational programmes, effective procedures should be in place to (a) approve programmes of study, (b) monitor over a period of time their effectiveness against the stated aims and objectives for the programmes taking account of the success of students in attaining these stated, intended learning outcomes and (c) reviewing over time the continuing validity of these aims and objectives. 5. There must be an absolute separation between the financial/business activity of the organisation and th ose responsible for the accreditation and monitoring of educational programmes. It is acceptable for individuals to act as an accreditor but they should not stand to gain from a successful outcome. 6. The organisational structure and constitution of the body, including the membership and terms of reference of all committees, should be available with evidence of active participation and operation over a minimum of a 5-year period. 7. The minimum size of a viable regist er will normally be 300 individuals, except where the traditions are extremely small. 8. It should be clear from the organisa tion that the criteria for inclusion on the professional register inclu de language proficiency, health and fitness to practice, integrity, honesty, comprehension of written and spoken English, conduct and the a ttainment of minimum educational standards. There needs to be effective disciplinary procedures covering complaints from the public with appropriate separation in determining whether a prima-facie case exists and appropriate procedures for an investigation where necessary. 1609. There should be procedures in pl ace covering re-registration of individuals who have been removed from any register for any reason. 10. There should be evidence that the body is aware of the importance of criminal record disclosure and the necessity for this in order to protect the public. 161ISBN: 978 1 901085 93 8Report to Ministers from The Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK May 2008 "}
