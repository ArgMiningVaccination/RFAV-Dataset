'I think that's something that needs to be examined. We're not certain about that right now,' said Albert Bourla, when asked by Dateline's Lester Holt about whether the shot would prevent transmission during the interview, which aired Thursday night. The interview was recorded shortly before Pfizer confirmed that it will only be able to ship 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of the year - half as many as the 100 million the pharmaceutical giant had promised - due to supply chain issues. \"\"\" \"\"\"Scientists involved in oversight of the Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine trials are tempering excitement about efficacy, noting that the studies haven't shown yet whether the products can prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\"\"\" ...from Medscape From Nature .... \"\"\"Do the vaccines prevent transmission of COVID-19? In addition to the Pfizer vaccine, regulators are poring over data from another similar vaccine made by Moderna of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a third vaccine produced by AstraZeneca of Cambridge, UK, and the University of Oxford, UK. All three of these vaccines have been tested in large clinical trials, and have shown promise in preventing disease symptoms. But none has demonstrated that it prevents infection altogether, or reduces the spread of disease in a population. This leaves open the chance that those who are vaccinated could remain susceptible to asymptomatic infection \u2014 and could transmit that infection to others who remain vulnerable. \"In the worst case scenario, you have people walking around feeling fine, but shedding virus everywhere,\" says virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds, UK.\"\"\" The whole of the Nature article is well worth a read .....
