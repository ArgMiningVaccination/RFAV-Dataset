Not to be confused with caustic soda, this simple, one ingredient product is an essential for cleaning and laundry. It's also eco-friendly, suitable for septic tanks and contains no petrochemicals, and it can help you tackle some of the toughest [cleaning jobs](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/cleaning/a26790088/house-cleaning-30-minutes-organised-mum-method/) around the home. Soda crystals should be dissolved in warm water. [Dri-Pak](https://www.dri-pak.co.uk/cleaning-products/soda-crystals/), the only manufacturer of soda crystals in the UK, have outlined the strength of the solution required, although please note this is dependent on the task. As a guide, they recommend the following: - Mild: One tablespoon (20g) to one pint (500ml) of water - Regular: Half a cup (100g) to one pint (500ml) of water - Strong: One cup (200g) to one pint (500ml) of water And remember: If you are immersing your hands in soda crystals for any length of time, it's advised that you wear rubber gloves. 1. BLOCKED PIPES Shift a build-up of trapped grease and debris from your [kitchen](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/kitchen/news/g423/best-kitchen-design-trends/) sink, bathroom basin, bath, or shower waste pipes by pouring a mug of crystals down the plughole. Flush through with hot water. 2. SMELLY WASHING MACHINE Low temperature washes using liquid detergent can allow bacteria and mould to grow, and give rise to unpleasant smells in your machine. To prevent this from happening, once a month run a hot wash with nothing but 500g - 750g of soda crystals added to the detergent dispenser. 3. HARD WATER If you live in a hard water area, as much as two-thirds of the laundry detergent you carefully measure out is simply softening the water rather than cleaning! Make it go further, and save money, by adding two tablespoons of soda crystals to your detergent dispenser. Then you can use the more economical 'soft water' dose of detergent. Where to buy Soda Crystals: 4. GREASY PANS Soak greasy pans or those encrusted with burnt-on food in a solution of soda crystals and hot water - the longer you can leave them to soak the better. And if your roasting tray is full of fat after [cooking a roast](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/news/a1552/ingredients-for-the-perfect-sunday/), sprinkle on dry crystals while the tray is still hot. Leave to stand for a few minutes so the crystals soak up the fat, then scrape the mixture into the bin. 5. SPATTERED HOB AND EXTRACTOR FAN Wipe clean hobs, extractors and other greasy kitchen surfaces with a strong solution of 200g soda crystals dissolved in 1 pint (500ml) of hot water. Leave stubborn marks to soak for a minute or two, then wipe down with a clean cloth. But don't use soda crystals on aluminium surfaces, it will discolour them! 6. TARNISHED SILVER Bring your silver pieces back to their gleaming best. Line a bowl with foil and pour in hot water. Add 200g soda crystals to 1 pint (500ml) of hot water and wait for them to dissolve. Immerse your silver pieces (but not precious stones) in the solution. You'll see a fizzing reaction as the tarnish dissolves. Rinse each piece and dry. 7. STRIPPING WALLPAPER Need to remove leftover wallpaper paste? Make up a regular solution of soda crystals and use it as a sugar soap after stripping wallpaper. It will help remove the leftover wallpaper paste and you can prepare the wall for its next covering. 8. WASTE BINS Clean out your waste and recycling bins at home with a regular soda crystals solution. Add a handful of [Bicarbonate of Soda](https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/cleaning/news/a7/8-unexpected-uses-for-bicarbonate-of-soda/) in the bottom of the bin to deodorise it. 9. REFRESH PAINTWORK Brighten up paintwork and uPVC window frames with a regular solution of soda crystals and warm water. You can even use this same solution to prepare bare wood to be painted. 10. SOILED BABY CLOTHES Babies and young children have delicate skin that may be irritated by the enzymes and fragrances in many laundry detergents. You can remove dirt and stains in a way that's gentle on sensitive skin by soaking clothes in a solution of 100g soda crystals to 1 pint (500ml) hot water. Leave to stand for at least an hour, but preferably overnight, then machine or hand wash using Liquid Soap Flakes (buy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004MY6VU8) or [Waitrose](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/dp-liquid-soapflakes/581461-82431-82432)). 11. MOSSY PATHS AND PATIOS Make easy work of removing unsightly moss and algae from paving by sprinkling soda crystals on the affected areas, then moistening with water using a watering can or hose. Leave the solution to soak in for 24 hours, by which time the moss will turn brown and be easy to remove. Like this article?
