The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the lead agency for the federal government's response to the COVID -19 pandemic. A key component of that response will be access to a COVID -19 vaccine across the United States. Pharmacists, in partnership with other healthcare providers, are well -positioned to increase access to vaccinations \u2014particularly in certain areas that have too few pediatricians and other primary -care providers, or that are otherwise m edically underserved. 1 As of 2018, nearly 90 percent of Americans lived within five miles of a community pharmacy.2 Pharmacies often offer extended hours and added convenience. What is more, pharmacists are trusted healthcare professionals with establis hed relationships with their patients. Pharmacists also have strong relationships with local medical providers and hospitals to refer patients as appropriate. For example, pharmacists already play a significant role in annual influenza vaccination. In t he early 2018 -19 season, they administered the influenza vaccine to nearly a third of all adults who received the vaccine. 3 Nearly every State permits pharmacists to order and administer vaccines to both adults and children under certain circumstances. Therefore, as an Authority Having Jurisdiction under the Secretary's March 10, 2020 declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) issues this guidance. Subject to satisfaction of the requirements listed 1 See, e.g. , Guidance for Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians in Community Pharmacies during the COVID -19 Response , CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/pharmacies.html (last updated June 28, 2020) (\"As a vital part of the healthcare system, pharmacies play an important role in providing medicines, therapeutics, vac cines, and critical health services to the public.\"); Kimberly McKeirnan & Gregory Sarchet, Implementing Immunizing Pharmacy Technicians in a Federal Healthcare Facility , 7 P HARMACY 1, 7 (2019), https://www.mdpi.com/2226- 4787/7/4/152/htm (last visited Aug. 5, 2020) (HHS Indian Health Service study demonstrating \"the effective implementation of immunization- trained pharmacy technicians and the positive impact utilization of pharmacy support personnel can create\" on childhood vaccination rates in medically un derserved populations). 2 Get to Know Your Pharmacist , CDC , https://www.cdc.gov/features/pharmacist -month/index.html (last visited July 14, 2020). 3Early -Season Flu Vaccination Coverage \u2014 United States, November 2018, CDC , https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxvie w/nifs -estimates -nov2018.htm (last visited July 14, 2020). ________________________________________________________________________________________ U.S. Public Health Service below, this guidance authorizes State -licensed pharmacists to order and administer, and State -licensed or registered pharmacy interns acting under the supervision of the qualified pharmacist to a dminister, to persons ages three or older COVID -19 vaccinations that have been authorized or licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
