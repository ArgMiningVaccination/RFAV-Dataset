Burning candles is a nearly effortless way to shift the mood and awaken the senses through scent and sight. Although they might help you stick to your rituals, the truth is that candles could be harming your health. Many conventional candles (much like conventional [beauty products](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/natural-foundations-best-options-for-every-skin-tone)) contain toxins. A [report from the Environmental Protection Agency](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1009BZL.txt) referenced research that measured traces of lead and [formaldehyde](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-best-nontoxic-polishes-and-why-clean-polish-is-important) above cancer-causing thresholds, among other chemicals that are harmful to health, particularly in people who have preexisting respiratory conditions like asthma. Advertisement That's the bad news. The good news is that there's plenty you can do to ensure that your indoor air pollution levels stay low. Here's a checklist of what to look for when shopping for new candles, plus a few recommendations of clean-burning candle brands. What to look for in a nontoxic candle There are three main indicators to keep an eye out for: Wicks Some wicks have a metal core, which may contain lead and other metals, even though [lead has been banned](https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-bans-candles-with-lead-cored-wicks) in candles since 2003. In some cases, you can see the metal, but in others it's woven in with other materials. Plus, it's important to consider the size of the wick. \"Too large a wick for the vessel will cause the container to get really hot and produce heavy amounts of soot and residue. Too small of a wick won't produce any fragrance, and it will create a well of leftover wax on the side of the candle container,\" said Hannah Hosemann, candlemaker and founder of [ELEMENT candles](https://www.othosbrand.com/collections/element/candles). So if you notice your candle is producing soot or leaking wax, it may be the size of your wick. Choose a 100% cotton wick or look for a wick made of wood, like cherrywood, which doesn't create ashy, sooty residue inside the container or surrounding walls. Advertisement Wax Paraffin- and petroleum-derived waxes release chemicals into the air when burned, even if they are \"premium grade.\" It's better to choose clean-burning soy wax or beeswax, but be sure to look for 100% on the labels, and, when possible, select wax that is naturally derived or sustainably sourced. Many candles are a blend of paraffin and another wax but will call it a \"beeswax\" candle, for instance, so read your labels or reach out to the brand if you're not sure. Fragrance Ah, fragrance. In the United States, cosmetics companies producing skin care, perfumes, and candles are legally permitted to list \"fragrance\" on the list of ingredients without explaining what that means because the [FDA protects it as \"trade secrets.\"](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm388821.htm) [1](#citations) Unfortunately, this lack of transparency could be masking whether the product contains allergens, toxic ingredients linked to illness, and known endocrine disrupters like [phthalates](http://www.ewg.org/research/dirty-dozen-list-endocrine-disruptors). Go for products that specify that they've used 100% naturally derived [essential oils](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/essential-oils-beginners-guide), are phthalate-free, or further explain the \"fragrance\" to be natural and nontoxic. mbg's top picks for the best non-toxic candles Ellis Brooklyn Pseudonym Handmade in New York City, Ellis Brooklyn has quickly become one of the most coveted nontoxic fragrance manufacturers.
