This looks OK on paper, but the end result in uninspiring.", "sitename": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "date": "2011-08-24", "cleaned_text": "This was published 12 years ago Eat Yourself Sexy Australia, Thursday, August 25 By Brad Newsome LifeStyle You, 8.30pm Ugh. This looks OK on paper: former MasterChef presenter Sarah Wilson (pictured) getting people to lose weight, get fit and hopefully rediscover their libidos. And tonight's episode has a perfect subject in new mum Amanda, who has put on 15 kilograms and is intelligent and articulate but unhappy. The first disappointment is with the program's supposed medical expert, a nutritionist and naturopath who practises such scientifically implausible things as homeopathy, iridology and ear candling. Thankfully, she's not doing any of that here tonight and some of the dietary advice she gives Amanda seems sensible enough. Not all of it, though. For one thing, she stops Amanda eating gluten, which is pointless in the absence of coeliac disease or other gluten sensitivity and which only makes Amanda's day-to-day life much more difficult. Amanda finds the going tough but after eight weeks of regular exercise and an improved diet, she has lost 7.5 kilograms. The naturopath declares that 4.5 kilograms of that was ''pure fat''. What was the other three kilos? Impure fat? Muscle, bone and eyeballs? We may never know. Another disappointment is that the program doesn't address the question of whether Amanda might have been depressed - I mean, she's a personal trainer herself, yet some days she can't even bring herself to walk to the front gate to check the letterbox. She might not have been depressed but since so many new mums do come down with depression, it might have been a good place to bring it up. Then again, that could have cut into the time needed for the few-minute fashion makeover at the end. Amanda might have got a good result but it's still an overwhelmingly disappointing episode that inspires little optimism for the rest of the series. "}
