We understand that this is a big transition, and it comes with a lot of intention. We deeply value our community and will remain committed to doing our best to help make acupuncture accessible.

At Maryville Acupuncture, we're proactively taking steps to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 coronavirus to our community of patients and staff, especially now with a confirmed case of coronavirus in Tennessee. We'd like to share with you a few preventative measures to ensure the health and well-being of our patients and staff, as well as some links to helpful public health information. Our aim is to make our clinic a healthy place for all. Many of our patients present with common non-contagious/non-serious upper respiratory symptoms such as allergies, asthma or a lingering cough following a cold, which we will continue to treat these conditions as they do not pose a risk to others. Please use hand sanitizer when you check in at the front desk, or wash your hands in the bathroom. We also have hand sanitizer in the treatment rooms. Feel free to help yourself. When washing your hands, please wash for at least 20 seconds. We change sheets, pillowcases and face cradle covers after each patient. We regularly sanitize surfaces that are frequently touched such as door knobs, doors and faucets. We clean our bathroom regularly. Cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than onto your hands. If you sneeze or cough on your hands or into tissues or a handkerchief, please wash your hands or use hand sanitizer afterwards. If you are coughing for any reason, please wear a mask. We understand it may be from allergies, asthma, or even heartburn, but it will help alleviate concerns from others sharing the space. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, eyes and face with unwashed/non-sanitized hands. Here are some more guidelines and links to inform you about how to take care of yourself and recommended practices regarding COVID-19: At least once a week in the clinic, I get the question \"Can acupuncture help with weight loss?\" My answer - \"yes... kind of\" - has a long caveat in front of it, so let's break it down. Here's a view of both sides Here's the bad news - acupuncture alone will (most likely) not cause you to lose weight. Let's be real, I wish I had the magic bullet for weight loss as much as anyone. But, it's more important to me to be honest; and my honest truth is that acupuncture and Chinese Medicine can help support you in your weight loss journey, not make the weight fall off for you. Unfortunately. The good news is, though, that even though there's no mystical, magical weight loss point, incorporating regular acupuncture into a weight loss regimen can make your journey easier, more comfortable and more enjoyable. Here's how: Keeping you comfortable during exercise Most weight loss programs incorporate exercise, and we all know that increasing exercise usually means some type of discomfort - like achy knees, backs, feet and shoulders. Acupuncture can help you recover quickly from any of these exercise related aches and pains so that you can get back to the trail, treadmill or pool. Optimizing your metabolism Healthy metabolism comes from healthy digestion. Acupuncture can help regulate your digestion so you're absorbing nutrients and eliminating wastes optimally, which will fuel your metabolism and support burning calories. Managing stress and maintaining motivation Weight loss can be stressful, with all the changes to your lifestyle, schedule and diet. Using acupuncture to manage stress can help decrease your cortisol, which can support weight loss. And decreased stress allows your motivation to stay present and focused on your weight loss goal. Keeping cravings at bay This is about as close to a magical weight loss point as it comes - there are protocols, specifically involving auricular (ear) acupuncture, that can help diminish cravings. To be clear, this won't keep you from eating unhealthy food, but it does give you a little extra emotional and energetic support when it comes to making the choice not to eat unhealthy food. There are times when surgery is necessary, and we often get questions from our patients regarding the use of acupuncture before and after surgery. In most cases, acupuncture is a great option to help ease symptoms before and after surgery, as well as to help you heal from your procedure. Break it down Here's a little break down of how we use acupuncture to foster the most comfortable and healthy surgical experience. Managing pain pre-procedure - The most common reason people receive surgery is because something hurts! And unless you're receiving an emergency procedure, you'll likely have to wait days or weeks from your time of diagnosis to your procedure. Although it won't be able to repair the damaged structures causing your issue, acupuncture can help decrease your body's pain signaling and tissue inflammation, which will do a lot to relieve your pain. Whether it's from a shoulder injury, a colon issue, a car accident, or anything in between, if you're in pain, acupuncture is a good option to help keep you comfortable until your procedure. Decreasing the side effects of anesthetics/analgesics and recovering quicker from them - Another reason we see our patients before and after surgery is to help the body process the drugs needed for anesthesia and analgesia. These drugs that \"put you to sleep\" during surgery can have quite a few side effects, such as nausea, constipation dizziness and confusion. Acupuncture supports your liver's ability to process these drugs and eliminate them from your body, so that you return to feeling \"normal\" quicker. It can also encourage bowels to move that have been slowed by analgesics, which naturally relieves constipation. Wound healing and procedure recovery - Acupuncture has been shown to decrease post-procedural wound healing time and increase range of motion. It decreases systemic inflammation and upregulates your immune response so that the efforts your body is making to repair itself become even more effective and quicker. This anti-inflammatory effect will also extend to any joints that have been operated on, allowing them to move more comfortably when they are ready. Managing stress - Regardless of the type of procedure you're preparing for, and how your body is feeling, anticipating surgery can cause its own anxieties - about the procedure itself, the recovery, taking time off work, taking care of your responsibilities while you recover, etc. Acupuncture is especially helpful to calm your mind and body in these moments so that you can approach your procedure and the decisions surrounding it from a healthy emotional state. Building your healthcare team Here at Maryville Acupuncture, we're committed to serving as part of your healthcare team. When you're anticipating a procedure, we always request that you inform your surgeon's team that you're receiving acupuncture. We're happy to answer any question you \u2014 or your surgeon \u2014 may have regarding the safety and efficacy of acupuncture in respect to your procedure.

Specifically, there are two formulas we use often in treatments to treat musculoskeletal pain: po sum on and white flower oil. Po Sum On is a proprietary blend of Chinese herbs and peppermint oil that we use to warm the muscles and joints, especially in the cases of chronic pain/injury. This oil is especially good for old back aches, neck aches, and sore arthritic fingers. White Flower Oil is a common analgesic liniment in China for aches and pains. In the clinic we use it when we want to cool the body - in cases of acute strain or flares of old injuries. It contains menthol, camphor, lavender, wintergreen and other oils that produce a cold sensation on the skin. Here at Maryville Acupuncture, our practitioners utilize their years of experience treating pain of all sorts. Each visit, your acupuncturist will assess the quality, intensity, duration and frequency of your pain, as well as your current treatment regimens with your PCP and/or other physicians. We strive to be another source of excellent care as part of your integrated healthcare team. "}
