They are put into groups based on how they work. The two main groups of targeted therapy drugs are monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. New drugs become available every year, so talk to your cancer specialist for the latest information. Learn more about: Monoclonal antibodies The body's immune system makes proteins called antibodies to help fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are manufactured (synthetic) versions of these natural antibodies. They lock onto a protein on the surface of cells or surrounding tissues to affect how cancer cells grow and survive. Monoclonal antibodies can be classified as targeted therapy or immunotherapy, depending on the type of monoclonal antibody. Types of targeted therapy monoclonal antibodies include: | | Type | | How they work | | Examples |angiogenesis | inhibitors |These drugs reduce the blood supply to a tumour to slow or stop it growing. They target various proteins linked with the growth of new blood vessels and stop them from working.|| | |HER2-targeted | agents | | High levels of the protein HER2 cause cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. Some targeted therapy drugs destroy the HER2 positive cancer cells, or reduce their ability to divide and grow. | | |anti-CD20 | monoclonal antibodies |These drugs target a protein called CD20 found on some B-cell leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.|| | Small molecule inhibitors These drugs are small enough to get inside cancer cells and block certain proteins that tell cancer cells to grow. Types of small molecule inhibitors include: | | Type | | How they work | | Examples |TKIs||Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block proteins called tyrosine kinases from sending signals that tell cancer cells to grow, multiply and spread. Without this signal, the cancer cells may die.|| | |mTOR inhibitors||These drugs block mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein that tells cancer cells to grow and spread.|| | |PARP inhibitors||These drugs block poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a protein that repairs damaged DNA in cancer cells.|| | |CDK inhibitors||These drugs block cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) from sending signals that tell cancer cells to grow, multiply and spread. Without this signal, the cancer cells may die.|| |[ ](/podcasts/episode-8-new-cancer-treatments-immunotherapy-targeted-therapy/) Podcast: Immunotherapy and Targeted Therapy Listen now Key resource Download a PDF booklet on this topic.
