A DO is a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, whereas an MD is a Doctor of Allopathic Medicine. There is no difference in what services either type of physician can provide. One is not better than the other and the vast majority of their training is nearly identical. While likely an oversimplification, the primary difference between DO and MD training is a matter of philosophy, where the DO perspective views all systems of the body as interconnected pieces of the larger system. In addition, DOs undergo a required 200 hours of training in hands-on diagnosis and treatment referred to as Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine. How Are DOs Different from Chiropractors? A DO is a fully licensed physician who is credentialed to do anything an MD can do. A chiropractor, however, is not a physician. They have a separate type of license which requires less education and training, limiting their scope of treatment. As a physician, a DO can prescribe any medication required for treatment, order any tests or advanced images required for diagnosis and refer to any specialty appropriate to treat a patient, in addition to providing hands-on treatment of musculoskeletal tissues. Chiropractic care often focuses on bone alignment and High-Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) techniques (Popping and cracking). This can provide immediate relief, but the root dysfunction often pulls bones back out of alignment requiring repeated treatments to maintain the desired result. Biweekly follow up treatments are typically required. While HVLA techniques can be a useful tool, OMT performed by a DOs typically start by addressing soft tissue-like muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. This allows the physician to address the root cause of the dysfunction, achieving similar pain relief, but with longer lasting results. There are certainly exceptions but follow up visits are seldom more frequent than two weeks apart. Differences in What to Expect A small fraction of DOs dedicate sufficient time to become experts in this hands-on skillset for diagnosis and treatment of tissue related injury and dysfunction. At Restoration Osteopathic Medicine, our physicians are among the best in the country at this very skillset. In fact, students travel from medical schools across the United States and in some cases, the world for an opportunity to train with Dr. Works. Our physicians will utilize their extraordinary skillsets and every appropriate diagnostic tool to define the root cause of your pain or dysfunction and create a treatment plan to improve your condition. These treatment plans very often involve stretching, massage or exercise techniques to alter physiology. Patient participation is critical to achieving a lasting resolution of any dysfunction.
