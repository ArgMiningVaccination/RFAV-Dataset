Detailed information about the room layout and even virtual tours can be found on the Housing Dining Hospitality (HDH) grad family website. A picture of the communities is shown below! For grad students, the cheapest rent you'll nd near campus is likely to be the on- campus graduate student housing. UCSD claims that monthly rent in grad housing costs 20% less than market value. Beginning October 1, 2021, an incoming resident will pay less than $1,000/mo for a single room (the actual rate depends on which building and unit you are renting), and double occupancy reduces your rent by half. Check out the UCSD Graduate Housing FAQs page for more information.Graduate Student HousingIf you're not eligible for on-campus student housing, or are otherwise electing to live off campus, the best rates are likely to be found in a Facebook group. UCSD has several active unofcial housing groups (e.g. UCSD Student Off-Campus Housing) that students (or anyone looking for housing) can join, and oftentimes by joining onto someone's earlier lease your rent can be signicantly less than if you were to rent a similar unit in the same complex. It is also a great platform to meet new potential roommates to go apartment searching together. On any social platform, beware of scammers! Use your best intuition and judgment to discern offers that seem too good to be true. While it may be tempting to narrow your search to the nearest ve minutes to campus, you can nd much better deals if you're willing to be a little further away. If you don't have a car, try looking at places near the Blue Line Trolley, and if you do have a car, consider looking at homes in Mira Mesa that you can rent with a group of friends. Hillcrest is another popular area for students to live, and although the Hillcrest shuttle has been discontinued, you'll be surrounded by other students from UCSD and SDSU. Clairemont/Convoy is also popular with students, and depending on the area there may be a convenient bus to get to your classes.7 Choosing a Location SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023Off-Campus HousingFive Below, named for its Dollar Tree-like variety of items $5 and under, has a great assortment of affordable room d\u00e9cor and other room utility essentials that would otherwise cost more from places like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. The quality tends to be much better than Dollar Tree. The nearest Five Below is in the same shopping center as the Mira Mesa Marshalls. Across the street from this shopping center is another Target, which has a better stock of Command strips than you'd otherwise see. Finally, to ll in the rest of your needs on your shopping list, check out IKEA, a 20-minute drive from campus. During back to school season, they have a curated list on their website of suitable dorm room items, which can help when deciding what you're looking for. IKEA tends to have better prices for larger organizers than Marshalls does, as well as a potentially better selection of lighting options. Make sure to check the website to see what's in stock before you make the trip given their current shipping delays.Marshalls (the closest is right off campus at La Jolla Village Square) is a great spot for room essentials like organizers, bedding, towels, and kitchen essentials at a reduced price. Pro tip: at the start of the school year, the La Jolla Village Square location tends to be busy with parents. The Mira Mesa location has a much better stock with shorter lines! This is especially useful in the bedding section (where they notably have a selection of twin size sheets). It also happens to be close to the next spot, Five Below.Shopping for Home Goods IKEAFive BelowMarshalls If you live on campus, be mindful of clothes storage. The closets are small and will not t much! Look up \"[your residential area] dorm tour ucsd\" on YouTube to know what to expect when it comes to room layout, furniture, and get a better feel of the room size. Sometimes they also will show the closest dining and laundry facilities, and other essentials around where you live. Choose an earlier move-in day to have a better selection! Bring something that reminds you of home, like photos or some sentimental memorabilia, to make the space feel like yours. Set up a video call with your best friend from home during your rst night in your dorm. Buy a mattress pad! Most of the dorm mattresses are very well-used. Consider living in your dorm for one night and taking note of things that would make your routines feel easier; that's your shopping list for the next day.General Tips SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 20238Both Dining Dollars and Triton Cash have a 1:1 equivalency with US Dollars (i.e. $1 USD = $1 in dining), but don't make the mistake when you come to campus thinking that they are the same thing. Dining Dollars are accepted at all dining halls and on-campus grocery markets, and only dining halls and on-campus grocery markets. Triton Cash can also be used in dining halls and markets, but also at any other place on campus, such as the food stalls at Price Center (including Sunshine Market and Tapioca Express) and the Old Student Center (like Blue Pepper). These places also take cash/card payments. Some places off campus accept Triton Cash as well; the complete list is on HDH's website, which notably includes the nearby Whole Foods. If you are an incoming student to UCSD, that is, you are a rst year or transfer student, you are offered two dining plan options: the 5623 plan and the 3749 plan. If you are a continuing student, you are offered the same two options as well as a third option: the 1874 plan. The 5623 plan comes with $5,623 in Dining Dollars, and a bonus $100 of Triton Cash. It is intended to cover 3 meals a day, 5 days a week. The 3749 plan comes with $3,749 in Dining Dollars, and a bonus $50 of Triton Cash. It is intended to cover 2 meals a day, 5 days a week. The 1874 plan comes with $1,874 in Dining Dollars, but does not have a bonus in Triton Cash. It is intended to cover 1 meal per day. Remember that you can always add money to your account, but excess dining dollar credits only roll over one quarter before they expire. (Triton Cash lasts through graduation.)9 The general concept behind Triton Cash is to alleviate the need to carry around cash or cards; you can get around campus with only your ID. However, if you plan on carrying your wallet around anyways, Triton Cash may sound redundant. The only case in which a student would need Triton Cash if they live on campus because laundry facilities do not accept quarters or other currency! Make sure to check your Transacts eAccount before running your rst load of laundry.What's The Point Of Triton Cash? What Does My Dining Plan Cover?What's The Difference Between Dining Dollars And Triton Cash? SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023Campus Currencies If you need to get to the opposite corner of campus, or even have a class at SIO (Scripps Institute of Oceanography), the best way is to take the campus shuttle. Check ucsdbus.com to check the best route, where stops are located, and see the live location of buses. Some routes, like IL/OL (Inner Loop/Outer Loop; same route but clockwise/counterclockwise) run every 10 minutes and connect all of campus. Route GC only runs once an hour on the weekends to bring students to the Convoy/Clairemont shopping and dining area. UCSD allows you to ride the MTA buses for free! Make sure you have Pronto downloaded on your phone and follow the instructions to receive your pass (see more information below on how to get your Triton U-Pass).10 The new blue line trolley cane take you directly to campus from many locations along the coast of San Diego. It connects to UTC on one end and Old Town on the other, as well as several other stops. This choice is great for those without cars because of the convenience of trolley stop locations. It is also a great choice for commuter students with a car since there is free parking in some stations. Best of all, both the Trolley and the bus are free with your Triton U-Pass! The 201 and 202 buses run clockwise/counterclockwise and connect UCSD with the La Jolla Village Square shops, UTC, Vons, and off-campus student neighborhoods. This service primarily has UCSD students on board and runs every 10 minutes during the week and every 15 minutes on the weekend. It only runs from the center of campus (UCSD Transit Center), so depending on where you live it might not be the most convenient. The 101 bus route runs from UTC all the way up to Oceanside, with parts right along the ocean. However, it only runs once every 30 minutes and can often have delays or inconsistencies with the schedule. Biking the 101 can be more pleasant for a leisure weekend activity, but without a car the bus is a viable option.MTS Trolley Best Bus RoutesCampus ShuttlesHow do we get around San Diego?

It is smaller than Geisel with only two floors, and make sure to check their open hours before you decide to stop by (they tend to have slightly shorter hours than Geisel). At any rate, if you need a change of environment, the Biomedical library denitely offers that.If you're willing to make the walk to the south end of Revelle, Galbraith Hall is one of the best-kept secret study spots at UCSD. It has a newly-renovated interior with two study rooms: one \"active study\" room where students can partake in group study, and one \"silent study\" that is supposed to mimic the upper floors of Geisel. Connected to the silent study room is also a group study room that students can reserve. The active study room tends to be less rowdy than the lower floors of Geisel, so it's the perfect environment if you work best with just a little noise, and the silent study room has a great non-intimidating layout and atmosphere to really buckle down and get to work.12 The second floor patio at the SME building is spacious with plenty of tables for students to study. The newly constructed amphitheater is right next to it and makes the 2nd floor patio of the SME building a little bit vibrant. Sometimes you can hear the sound from rehearsals or performance happening at the amphitheater. It might not be a perfect place if you are looking for somewhere quiet, but if you would like to have a coffee chat with classmates or you like snacking while studying (food generally isn't allowed in the libraries), the 2nd floor patio will be a great place for you.

Blue Pepper Blue Pepper has been a longtime favorite of UCSD students, located in the Old Student Center near Revelle College. They serve delicious Thai food with plenty of vegan and vegetarian options in very generous servings, and are open until 8pm on weekdays. If you haven't tried Blue Pepper, consider your rst meal there to be a rite of passage in TritonHood.

They are a small chain where you can totally customize your own acai bowl (but for your rst time, consider ordering the Lazy Blue to take the guesswork out of it!). Especially if you aren't from San Diego or southern California, use Blue Bowl as an entry into the local acai bowl subculture.13 Student Center A SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023Where To Eat Price Center East Santorini Discover the culinary delights of Greece without leaving the UCSD campus at Santorini Island Grill.

Notable dining halls include the hEAT stand at Pines in Muir College, which serves comforting Asian-inspired dishes (that are likely the most authentic you'll nd around campus); as well as Makai at Sixth College, which serves poke bowls with unlimited toppings, and several pre-designed bowls. Regardless of which dining hall you end up at, there will always be vegan and/or vegetarian options available.

They have a food court with great variety, and inside their food court is an ice rink open to the public. They have some coffee shops and a koi pond as well, so even just window shopping is an enjoyable experience in itself. Because UTC is accessible by so many buses (most frequently the 201, 202, and 101) and is at the end of the Trolley's Blue Line, this is denitely a hub for students on weekends.Where To Shop Go Thrifting! Buffalo Exchange and Flashbacks, Located in Hillcrest are great places for thrift shopping. Those stores are facing each other across Fifth Avenue. They both offer a nice selection of trendy clothing, shoes, and accessories for both men and women. Highly recommended to go there and finding nice cheap clothes to take home! What is more? You can also sell your stuff that you don't wear anymore!17Target: Not every college has a convenient on-campus location of Target; in fact, UCSD is the only UC to have one! The prices are not marked up any more than other off-campus locations, and they offer a great selection of body care products, household essentials, and snacks priced much lower than at the food markets like Roger's and Sixth Market. The selection of most other things (like clothes and furnishings) is much more limited than at a typical Target, but the weekend Grocery Shuttle stops by the Balboa Target. Trader Joes: For quick meals: Most college students rely on Trader Joe's because of its selection of its prepared frozen meals and entrees that make cooking so much faster and easier, but because of its convenience, going at the wrong time can cost a long time in the checkout line. It's accessible by the 101, 201, and 202 bus routes, as well as the Trolley. Try going in the mornings, or roughly within an hour before closing (they currently close every day at 9 pm) for the shortest lines. Ralphs: Ralphs is a good place for shopping for general grocery stuff. It is about 5~7 mins driving distance from campus. It is open until 1 AM so you can go there for some quick shopping after finishing study. Make sure you have Ralphs app downloaded so that you can enjoy the discount. Vons: Vons is also a great place to do grocery and they are open until 12 AM. It is a little far from campus compared to other grocery stores, but there is a very good bagel place near Vons called 'Daily Bagel'. There are more good restaurants too, so try some of them when you go to this shopping complex. Whole Foods Market: Whole Foods Market only keeps only very good quality and healthy foods and ingredients (they don't have Coke!), therefore it is more expensive than other grocery stores around campus. But it is a great place when you want the most fresh vegetables and fruits! Also, they have a buffet-like dining place where you can take all the food and pay based on weight.Where To Get Groceries The Grocery Shuttle (running hourly on weekends, see the GC schedule) connects the center of campus with Convoy, the part of San Diego known for its variety of Asian restaurants and grocery stores (H Mart and several locations of Ranch 99 are located here).

Good for them. It's still a great place to seek out, and every student should give the short walk a try at some point. On Google, it's called the hidden swing, and lots of reviews talk about the easiest ways to get there. The swing itself faces more of La Jolla Shores than westward towards the sunset, but if you sit nearby there's easily room to see the pretty colors.19 It's difcult to think of a more quintessentially UCSD experience than going to Gliderport to watch the sunset. Gliderport is a ten minute walk straight off of Seventh College, which can be accessed by the IL and OL campus buses if you don't live on that corner of campus. With tons of rocks to perch on and a great view of the cliffs down to La Jolla Shores, it's popular for friends and couples. Make sure to check the cloudiness before you make the walk over!

That way, you will have an idea of how each week of your quarter will look like and you can plan accordingly. Aromatherapy, plants, and music can help! Set study goals for each study session. You might aim to study for three hours, or review three chapters of a textbook. Just remember that it is important to be realistic about your goals to avoid any frustrations in case they are not met. Reward yourself. After a study session and after turning in an assignment or an exam, make sure you recognize your efforts and treat yourself with your favorite meal, spending some time with friends and family, or making time for your favorite activity. Organize a study group. The people in your group can help one another work through a difcult problem, provide encouragement, hold each other accountable, provide different perspectives, and make studying more enjoyable. Explaining difcult concepts to others is also another great way to help with comprehension and retention of the material. Take practice tests. This is a great way to discover gaps in your knowledge, and practice problems on a time limit. Making flashcards and having a friend quiz you are also great ways to practice! Ask for help! Professors, peers, TAs, tutors, advisors, graders, and readers are all people available to help you!

There you will nd information on Academic Advising, Academic Plans for Freshmen and Transfers, Focus Sequence, Technical Electives, General Education, Academic Enrichment Opportunities, Student Organizations and Project Teams, and much more!49 For Undergraduate StudentsThe M.S. program is considered a \"self-funded\" program, which means that the student is responsible for paying the tuition and that funding/fellowship opportunities are few and far between. M.S. Students are encouraged to apply for Instructional Assistant (IA) positions (Teaching Assistantship, Readership) but there is a rigorous selection process and PhD students are given priority. Since there may not be many IA positions within the Structural Engineering (SE) Department, many M.S. Students apply to IA opportunities within other departments (i.e. Mathematics, other STEM departments, and even Language Arts departments). There may also be some opportunities throughout the academic year where the Graduate Division announces fellowship opportunities that maybe open to M.S. students as well. For more information on these, please visit the Graduate Financial Support webpage. Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) positions may be available if you choose the M.S. degree with the Thesis track, though they are not guaranteed. You will need to seek out a SE Faculty member to conduct research with; please review contact information on our website (faculty listed under \"Leadership\" and \"Professors\") to contact them directly. GSR positions are typically reserved for Ph.D. students, although sometimes M.S. students are able to obtain one as well. Funding availability will depend on each Faculty Advisor and will need to be discussed with them directly. SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 202350 Additionally, you can nd your program planning forms to download on the SE Website. You'll see that there are 2 plans within the SE75 M.S. program. There is a COMPrehensive Plan Track and a THESIS Plan Track. The llable forms can be found on the yellow buttons:Funding Comprehensive vs. Thesis Track For M.S. StudentsSE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023or Important Enrollment dates can be found here. Class enrollment is done via WebReg but when you need preapproval for a course, you will need to use EASy. Once your EASy request has been approved, please give it one business day before enrolling in the course via WebReg.51 If you are curious what they mean by focus area, you will want to refer to the Focus Areas link. Please note that some classes are not offered every semester so you'll want to check what quarter they are typically scheduled as well. Additionally, if you want to lighten your workload for 1 or 2 quarters, please note that you're able to take up to 8 units of preapproved UG Courses that are listed here. If you want to take any courses that are not outlined on our website, please contact your advisor and let them know which course you would like to take and why. Your advisor will then discuss it with the Graduate Affairs Committee (GAC) and provide you with feedback. Students usually select/nalize their track once they meet and discuss their interest with their faculty advisors in the fall orientation. If you'd like to read more about the different tracks, please see page 7 through 9 on the SE Graduate Handbook. If you're interested in the PhD program after you begin the M.S. program, you will need to ll out this form. SE advisors HIGHLY recommend speaking with SE Faculty if you decide to pursue the PhD program since they are the ones who can decide to move your application forward. Enrolling in Classes and Transferring CreditsAll exams and necessary documents must be completed by 2pm of the last Friday of the quarter in order for it to be considered for that quarter's completion date. If any of the documentation is missing, your exam completion will be marked for the end of the following quarter. Additionally, all PhD exams that are passed during the summer will be processed by the end of fall quarter. All exam guides are posted on the SE PhD Website under the Doctoral Examination section. If you're taking one of these exams, you will need to follow the appropriate guides:PhD students' primary responsibility is to perform research under the guidance of their PI. Please ensure you read over the Student Employees section, as it contains important information regarding your employment with UCSD as a PhD student. *Departmental Qualifying Examination Guide *Ph.D. Advancement to Candidacy Senate Examination Guide *Dissertation Final Defense Guide (abstracts are due at least 1 to 2 weeks in advance so that announcements can go out to the SE Department)52 SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023For PhD Students PhD Exams If you have a general idea of when you'll be taking your exam (i.e. month or date), please let se-gradadm@ucsd.edu know asap. If you are only defending your thesis and not enrolling in the quarter, you will be responsible for paying a ling fee upon the successful completion of your defense. The ling fee is typically around $200.If you plan on taking the DQE exam this quarter and plan on obtaining an M.S. Degree through the Ph.D. program, please request to ll out the M.S. Application to Candidacy paperwork. This is only possible if you have no other M.S. degree due to UCSD's Duplication of Degree policy.1. 2. 3.Upon your earliest convenience, make an in person appointment with your P.I. (SE Faculty Advisor). We recommend discussing the following items during your rst few meetings: 1. How often does your P.I. want to meet with you? Will it be in person or over zoom? What is expected of you to present or do during the meetings? 2. When you are taking classes during the quarter, how many hours of research a week are you expected to complete? 3. If you have a difcult course, are you allowed to \"make up\" the research hours during winter/spring/summer break? 4. If given a task to do (i.e. \"Please x the computer tower\"), always ask when it is due so that there is a clear agreed upon goal in mind. If you're unsure what to do, ask questions to get clarication. If you need more time, please communicate it BEFORE the deadline so that the P.I. is aware of any delays in tasks being completed. 5. Before ending a meeting, we suggest asking, \"Is there anything else I can do or help with?\" If you're unable to take on any additional tasks at that given time, ensure that your P.I. is aware of your current workload. 6. When you are close to graduating, discuss if the faculty member would be available to hood you (if you'd like) at the graduation ceremony. Never assume that faculty members will attend the graduation ceremony. 7. Before the end of every quarter, ask your P.I. if you will need to apply to TAships. If they are not sure, apply anyway. It's better to have your application in early. If possible, try NOT to TA during your rst year at UCSD. Acclimating to the curriculum, school, and research environment can be a lot to take on all at once so you'll want to avoid the workload of having to TA on top of adjusting to school. If this is not possible, clearly communicate with both your PI & the professor regarding your workload.Although most of our PhD students receive stipends and employee payment over the summer, PhD students do not enroll in courses. If you do enroll in summer session courses, please note that you will need to cover the cost of the course.53 SE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 2023PhD Summer Schedules General Tips for SuccessSE Student Affairs // Chair's Student Council 202354 Thank you and Good Luck!
