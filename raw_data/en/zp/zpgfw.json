Therapists have, for many years, built on these passions to help autistic kids learn skills such as collaboration, communication, and symbolic thinking through play therapy. Researchers find that LEGO building toys are a particularly fruitful tool for autism therapy\u2014and a great way to help autistic kids build an interest they can share with their neurotypical peers. Kobyakov / Getty Images The Theory Behind Play Therapy Educator Maria Montessori said that \"play is the work of childhood,\" by which she meant that children learn through play. Neurotypical children use play to expand and better understand their world, through experimentation, symbolic (imaginative) play, physical activity, sports, social interaction, and observation. By pretending to be adults, television personalities, or superheroes, children practice using spoken language and behaving in expected ways. By playing organized games, children learn how to follow rules, collaborate with teammates, take turns, and work toward a shared goal. Autistic children play very differently from their typical peers. They: Tend to play alone or engage in parallel play (two children doing the same thing, but on their own) Memorize and recite lines or actions from movies or TV, but rarely expand on what they've heard with their own ideas about characters or storylines Play games, but struggle with collaboration, turn-taking, or working toward a shared goal Many autistic children have specific play patterns or routines that they repeat over and over again. They may sing the same song from the same TV show in the same way with the same hand motions. They build the same thing from blocks or create the same train track layout. When asked to try something new, they may become terribly upset because they find running the same toy car in the same way calming, while change can provoke anxiety. Play therapy seeks to help autistic children overcome their challenges. By building on existing interests, play therapy can expand communication, imagination, and social skills. Rather than forbidding children to continue with their repetitive activities, play therapists use a variety of techniques to enrich and enhance their activities. If a child repetitively runs a truck over the same part of the carpet, a play therapist might place an obstacle on the carpet\u2014thus requiring the child to negotiate the change and interact with the therapist. Through the process of play therapy, many therapists have seen significant improvement in language, communication, collaboration, and even physical skills. Why LEGO Therapy Was Created LEGO building toys are popular among autistic children. They offer a simple, predictable, repeatable activity that can be accomplished alone without outside help. They are also part of a system of toys that look and work in similar ways. LEGOs also offer added bonuses because they: Require strong fine motor skills and significant hand strengthRequire spatial, visual, and analytical skillsHave intrinsic value in the wider world (LEGO play is universal, and LEGO models and structures have become well-recognized, not only as toy models but also as art forms.) Upon noticing that many autistic children are already drawn to and love LEGOs, clinical neuropsychologist Dr. Daniel LeGoff started experimenting with LEGO therapy in 2003. The idea was to create an effective social skills program that could be used in multiple settings and be transferable to real-world peer interactions. A book published in 2014 shows the positive results from the program he created. Today, there are multiple practitioners and programs all focused on LEGO therapy. While there are a variety of behavioral and developmental approaches to the therapy, most use similar techniques for engaging children and requiring them to build skills in order to achieve their play-related goals. How LEGO Therapy Works The goal of LEGO therapy is to build the types of skills that can help children better engage with peers, share experiences, and collaborate. This means that the autistic children who are likely to benefit from LEGO therapy are already at least somewhat verbal and able to follow both visual and verbal instructions. In the most basic form of LEGO therapy, children work in a group, taking the following roles: The Engineer: Has a set of instructions for the model and has to request the bricks from the Supplier and direct the Builder to put the model togetherThe Supplier: Has the Lego bricks and supplies the Engineer with the required items upon requestThe Builder: Is given the bricks by the Supplier and has to follow the instructions given by the Engineer to make the model. An adult facilitator works with the group as needed to encourage problem-solving, communication, and engagement. In some cases, several therapists work together, using LEGOs to build motor skills, facilitate speech, and enhance social communication. Therapists involved with LEGO therapy may be occupational therapists, speech therapists, behavioral therapists, or even psychologists. LEGO therapy can also be expanded to encourage creative play and collaboration through storytelling, dramatic activities, and innovation. For example, one version of LEGO therapy has children work together to build versions of a pretend world described in a story, or work together to create a vehicle that has specific qualities or can navigate in a particular situation. Children can also work together to build more elaborate LEGO Mindstorms robots and program them. In these scenarios, children collaborate in complex world-building, storytelling, or design. Is LEGO Therapy Effective? LEGO therapy is built around existing, effective, risk-free therapies. That means it can't hurt and will likely help your child to build skills and possibly meaningful friendships built around common interests. There are a limited number of studies focused on LEGO therapy, and most of those were conducted in small groups by individuals with a vested interest in seeing the therapy succeed. No specific type of therapy is always successful for every autistic child, and much depends on the chemistry of a therapy group and its facilitator. In any therapeutic setting, some children will come away with improved skills, while others won't. While the only thing you risk with LEGO therapy is time and money, you're more likely to see positive outcomes if your child: Actively enjoys building models with LEGOIs more or less at the same level of support needs as the other children in the groupHas the ability to follow verbal instructionHas shown at least some success in interactive play in the pastIs able to change their set ideas without significant emotional upsetIs motivated to build social relationships with peers Before getting started with LEGO therapy, have a discussion with the therapist(s) to determine what their goals are, what the mix of children is like, and what their therapeutic approach includes. Have a therapist meet and evaluate your autistic child to determine whether they are ready for this relatively advanced form of LEGO play therapy. If you're not sure about it, you may want to ask that your child participates for a trial period. What If My Child Doesn't Like LEGOs? There is nothing magical about LEGOs. In fact, the same therapeutic approach can work around any collaborative project that involves working together on a shared project toward a common goal. Over the years, therapists have worked with autistic children using a wide range of activities, toys, and characters that tend to be interesting to autistic people. While they don't all share the same fascinations, some common interests include: Thomas the Tank Engine Fantasy games such as Dungeons and Dragons Online collaborative games such as Minecraft It's possible to build a therapy group around these or any other shared interest. However, it's important that the group be properly structured and facilitated. It's also important to conduct preliminary evaluations, set benchmarks, and continuously monitor the group to be sure that progress is being made. LEGO Therapy Resources LEGO therapy is not available everywhere, but most therapists who work with groups of autistic children are able to incorporate LEGO play into their programs. Parents can also learn to use LEGOs as a therapeutic tool in their own homes, working with siblings or other adults as a team. To learn more about LEGO therapy, you may want to speak with your school's occupational or behavioral therapist. You also can speak with members of your local autism support group, or read one of these books: How LEGO\u00ae-Based Therapy for Autism Works: Landing on My Planet by Daniel B.
