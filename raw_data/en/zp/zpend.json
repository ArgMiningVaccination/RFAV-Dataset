Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 5/21/2015 I went to Balance Acupuncture initially because I had headaches every day for 3 years. After my first session with Susan, my headache was gone and didn't return for 2 weeks. Something had been out of balance in my body and she was able to find and correct it! I am so grateful and now go monthly for my acupuncture \"tune-ups.\" These help to relieve stress and keep the headaches at bay. Over the past five years, I have continued to see Susan and Tony and find them both to be highly skilled and knowledgeable. The best part is that no matter which practitioner I make my appointment with, I consistently get positive results. They both know their stuff. I would highly recommend Balance Acupuncture to address a specific health concern and/or to create lasting good health and relieve stress in your life. - 1/15/2013 Great, great, great experience! The doctor new right where my pain was and after my first visit I'm already feeling a lot better. I plan to come back and to recommend Balance Acupuncture to my friends and family. - 6/18/2012First to Review Dr. Tony is a great acupuncturist! I have been suffered neck and back pain for more than a year. I tried chiropractic, yoga, and massage but nothing really worked. I started to see Tony for acupuncture treatment about a month. He is very knowledgeable and patient. Dr. Tony uses massage, acpuncture, and cupping to treat me. My back & neck pain have reduced tremendously in just a month. I couldn't be happier and really thankful that I went to Balance Acupuncture! - 11/30/2012 I have been curious about acupuncture for some time. I always recommended it to friends and birth doula clients, but hadn't ever had it myself. I bought a Groupon for another company for one visit, and while the treatment helped for a few hours, I wasn't impressed with the practitioner or the way I was treated. Then I bought a Groupon for Balance Acupuncture, which included 4 treatments. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and comfortable with Susan and felt we had an instant rapport. She took the time to ask about my history, and importantly for me, she explained what she was doing and why. I felt that in every session we worked together to address the issues within my body, which was very cool, and that it absolutely made a difference. My 4th treatment was right before Thanksgiving, and I was stressed with the planning for that. The second I walked into the treatment room I felt myself completely relax. I look forward to continuing to see Susan for additional treatments, and will go even if it's just for a way to completely relax! I would highly recommend Susan to anyone considering acupuncture.
