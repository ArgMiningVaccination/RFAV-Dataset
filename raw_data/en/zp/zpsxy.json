The five (5) sites I selected after considering the Steering Committee's recommendation are as follows and are in no particular order: Manhattan, Kansas (Kansas State University), Athens, GA (University of Georgia, S. Milledge Avenue), San Antonio, TX (TX Research Park), Granville County, NC (Umstead Research Farm), and Madison County, MS (Flora Industrial Park). I made my decision using the evaluation criteria published in the \"Public Notice Soliciting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for Potential Sites for the NBAF\" which appeared in the FederalRegister on January 19, 2006, the DHS preferences communicated to all second round potential NBAF sites by letter on December 8, 2006, information collected by the site visit teams during their visit to each second round potential NBAF site, and observations made by me on mypersonal visits to each second round potential NBAF site. My decision is the result of myintegrated assessment and evaluation of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks associated with each proposed site against DHS's evaluation criteria and preferences. This memorandum documentsthe basis for my decision. Background To comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-9 \"Defense of United States Agriculture and Food\", the DHS Science & Technology (S&T) Directorate engaged in the analysis of the capabilities of research facilities supporting homeland security. The developmentof an integrated, national bio and agro-defense strategy has revealed that the Nation's currentnational bio and agro-defense capabilities are inadequate to meet future research requirementssupporting both agricultural and public health national security. Foreign animal disease studies, public health threats from emerging, high-consequence zoonotic pathogens, and the need for development and licensure of medical countermeasures have generated additional demands for biocontainment laboratory space. Current laboratory space available in the United States is notsufficient to support the increasing levels of resear ch, development, and testing needed to meet the growing concerns about accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases intothis country. Additional capability and capacity are also needed for high-consequence zoonotic disease countermeasures research and development (R&D) and medical countermeasure testing and evaluation. DHS is evaluating potential sites for a proposed new national R&D asset, the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), which is in the planning phase. The proposed facility size will be approximately 500,000 ft 2 and its site will require a minimum of 30 acres. The Office of National Laboratories (ONL) within the S&T Directorate is the office responsible for project development and construction. 1Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF The Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for Potential Sites for the NBAF was published in the Federal Business Opportunities on January 17, 2006 and in the Federal Register (Vol. 71, No. 12, p. 3107-3109) on January 19, 2006. DHS requested EOI submissions from Federal agencies, State and Local governments, industry, academia, and interested parties and organizations forpotential locations that would accommodate the construction and operation of the NBAF. Interested parties that wished to submit an EOI were able to do so in writing by March 31, 2006 to ensure its consideration. Twenty-nine (29) EOI submissions were received by March 31, 2006. On August 9, 2006, DHS selected eighteen (18) sites from twelve (12) consortia for further review, identified herein as the second round potential NBAF sites. The eighteen (18) sites were selected by evaluating the EOI submissions against the 4 evaluation factors (researchcapabilities, workforce, acquisition/ construction/ operations, and community acceptance) set forth in the published \"Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for Potential Sites for the NBAF.\" As stated in DHS's published \"Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for Potential Sites for the NBAF,\" DHS reserved the right to request additional information and clarifications fromconsortia whose submissions were deemed worthy of further consideration based on DHS's evaluation of their EOI submissions. DHS subsequently requested additional information within each of the four evaluation criteria to supplement the information initially requested by DHS in the published Request for Expressions of Interest. This request for additional information to facilitate further review of the second round potential NBAF sites was requested on December 8, 2006 from the 18 sites (the \"December 2006 Additional Information Requests\"). The December2006 Additional Information Requests also provided: (1) DHS's overall preferences within the evaluation criteria that would be utilized during the next round of evaluation; (2) an attachmentwith a detailed request for additional information relating to each of the four evaluation criteria from the original published Request for Expressions of Interest; and (3) notice of DHS's intent to schedule site visits for all twelve (12) consortia at eighteen (18) sites. Responses were due from the consortia by February 16, 2007. The Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium withdrew one of its site submissions on April 15, 2007 due to other development opportunities on this piece of property. Therefore, seventeen (17) second round potential NBAF sites were left for further review. Based on the initial evaluation of the EOI submissions, information submitted by the second round potential NBAF sites in response to the December 2006 Additional Information Requests,and information gathered during the site visits to the second round potential NBAF sites, I as the Selection Authority selected the short list of sites for analysis as reasonable alternatives to be considered in an EIS, which will assess the environmental impacts of constructing and operating the NBAF facility at the various alternative sites. The following sections explain the evaluation process as well as the criteria and preferences used to select the sites which will move forward in the process. Evaluation Process Overview The evaluation process review structure and selection responsibilities for the second round potential NBAF site selection process were organized into the following structure: 2Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF I as the Selection Authority (SA) made the final selection of the potential NBAF site(s) for which an EIS will be prepared.The Steering Committee provided the overall recommendation resulting from the evaluation process to me, the Selection Authority. The Steering Committee was responsible for overseeing the Criteria Committees evaluating the EOI submissions. The Steering Committeewas also responsible for evaluating the additional information submitted by the second round potential NBAF sites and for conducting visits to such sites. TheSteering Committee was chaired by the Steering Committee Chair, Mr. James Johnson, who oversaw and coordinated the entire evaluation process and was responsible for appointing all Criteria Committee members. The Steering Committee Chair was responsible for keeping meapprised of the evaluation process. Each Steering Committee member was the chair of a CriteriaCommittee. Criteria Committees for Research Capabilities, Workforce, Acquisition/Construction/Operations, and Community Acceptance, provided input and ratings (numerical and adjectival) on each site for their respective subject matter to the Steering Committee. Each Criteria Committee was comprised of Federal employees from various stakeholder agencies who are subject matterexperts, identified as Individual Reviewers. The Individual Reviewers have relevant expertise in their respective designated evaluation criteria and sub-criteria (Research Capabilities, Workforce, Acquisition/ Construction/ Operations, and Community Acceptance). EachIndividual Reviewer was vetted for possible conflicts of interest and, in the rare circumstancewhen the appearance of a possible conflict of interest was found, the Individual Reviewer did not participate in the review of the proposed site proffered by the consortium which posed the potential conflict of interest. The Evaluation Board (comprised of the Criteria Committees, the Steering Committee, and myself as the SA) followed an evaluation process that consisted of eight actionable process steps to ensure that the final site selection was based on integrated and validated adjectival and numerical ratings and findings pertaining to each of the second round potential NBAF site submissions. These process steps were Ratings andRatings and CommentCommentsConsolidate Committee meetsCommittee meets and provideand provides recommendatiorecommendation 33 44 55 66 77SelectionSelection AuthoritAuthority downselectdownselects sitessites 88 1. Individual reviewers were Federal employees who evaluated each of the second round potential NBAF site's original EOI and additional information submissions in response to the December 2006 Additional Information Requests for one of four individual criteria in 3Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF which the Individual Reviewer holds relevant expertise. During this evaluation, the Individual Reviewer provided comments regarding strengths, weaknesses, anddeficiencies as well as a numerical and adjectival rating for all identified sub-criteria within his or her respective criteria. 2. All of the Individual Reviewers' comments and ratings were consolidated to be considered collectively in a committee forum for each of the four individual evaluationcriteria. There were three Criteria Committees to evaluate the four evaluation criteria. One Criteria Committee, the Research and Workforce Committee evaluated two criteria.Each of the three Criteria Committees were comprised of all of the Individual Reviewers who provided comments and ratings regarding their assigned criteria for review. 3. Each of the three Criteria Committees met and reached a consensus on the rating and evaluation comments for each of the second round potential NBAF sites regarding only the Criteria Committee's respective evaluatio n criteria in which it has subject matter expertise. 4. The consensus comments and ratings of the three Criteria Committees were consolidated to be considered collectively by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee was comprised of the chairperson of each of the Criteria Committees and the SteeringCommittee Chair. 5. The Steering Committee met and reviewed the ratings and evaluation comments for each of the second round potential NBAF sites for all of the four evaluation criteria collectively. At this meeting, the Steering Committee identified any information to be clarified or validated at the confirmatory site visits. Each site was notified of information to be clarified or validated prior to the site visits in order to prepare sufficient materials. 6. Confirmatory site visits were conducted for each of the second round potential NBAF sites. The purpose of the site visits was to: (1) verify the information provided and representations made by the consortia in their EOI and additional information submissions; and (2) conduct a tour of the proposed sites to view any observable physical conditions and constraints and, if currently existing, view the sites' utilities and infrastructure. 7. The Steering Committee reached a consensus on the overall rating and evaluation comments for each of the second round potential NBAF sites based on the inputs of the three Criteria Committees and validations made during the confirmatory site visits. The Steering Committee then provided its recommendations, including ratings and comments,to me as the Selection Authority. 8. I made the final selection of the potential NBAF sites for which an EIS will be prepared. 4Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Evaluated Criteria and Preferences The EOI and additional information submissions from each of the second round potential NBAF sites were evaluated against DHS preferences identified in the December 8, 2006 additional information requests sent to the second round potential NBAF sites (the \"December 2006 Additional Information Requests\") and the four (4) evaluation criteria set forth in the published\"Request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for Potential Sites for the NBAF.\" The evaluationcriteria were developed prior to the EOI by an interagency working group (the \"Interagency Working Group\") to ensure that NBAF meets the interdependent needs of DHS, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Health and Human Services (HHS) to adequately protect the nation against biological threats to human health and animal agriculture. Each of the four (4) evaluation criteria (research capabilities, workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance) have sp ecific sub-criteria associated with them with descriptions for consideration during the evaluation process and potentially also have related topics from the December 2006 Additional Information Requests. These sub-criteria, descriptions, and additional information were developed to provide consistent guidance to Individual Reviewers throughout the evaluation process. Finally, DHS also advised the consortia in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests that DHS reserved the right to obtain information about each consortium's proposed site from other sources (e.g., thirdparties which may be hired by DHS to perform environmental due diligence, public records, and media reports) and DHS may factor any such information into its evaluation of a site. Each sub-criteria was given a score first by each Individual Reviewer, then by the applicable Criteria Committee, and finally by the Steering Committee. The scores were defined as seen in the chartbelow and in accordance with these adjectival ratings: Excellent/90-100 points : Site utilization, based on the information submitted in response to both DHS's EOI request and the December 2006 Additional InformationRequests, could substantially benefit the Government in all respects. The site wholly conforms with the stated preferences related to each specific criteria as stated in theDecember 2006 Additional Information Requests to the consortia. The submissionswere fully responsive to all original and additional information requests; including notification where requested information does not exist. The site offers one or moreStrengths offset by one or more Weaknesses and no Deficiencies. Site utilization would pose an excellent probability of success with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Very Good/80-89 points : Site utilization, based on the information submitted in response to both DHS's EOI request and the December 2006 Additional InformationRequests, could substantially benefit the Government in almost all respects. The site conforms with a majority of the stated preferences related to each specific criteria as stated in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests to the consortia. The submissions were fully responsive to a majority of the original and additional information requests and partially responsive to any remaining items; including 5Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF notification where requested information does not exist. The site offers one or more Strengths offset by one or more Weaknesses and/or one or more Deficiencies. AnyDeficiencies noted are correctable with minimal work. Site utilization would pose a high probability of success with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meetingthe Government's requirements. Satisfactory/70-79 points : Site utilization, based on the information submitted in response to both DHS's EOI request and the December 2006 Additional InformationRequests, could reasonably benefit the Government in most respects. The site conforms with some, but less than 50%, of the stated preferences related to each specific criteria as stated in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests to the consortia. The submissions were fully responsive to some of the original and additional information requests and partially responsive to the remaining items.Where requested information was missing there is no indication that the informationdoes not exist. The site offers no Strengths, has one or more Weaknesses, and one or more Deficiencies. Any Deficiencies noted may be correctable with some appreciable work. Site utilization would pose a reasonably good probability of success with an overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Marginal/50-69 points : Site utilization, based on the information submitted in response to both DHS's EOI request and the December 2006 Additional InformationRequests, may be suitable for the Government. The site does not conform to the stated preferences related to each specific criteria as stated in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests to the consortia. The submissions were not responsive to a majority of the original and additional information requests. Where requestedinformation was missing there was no indication that the information exists. The site offers no Strengths, has more than one Weakness, and has one or more Deficiencies. Any Deficiencies noted may not be correctable. Site utilization would pose a relatively low probability of success with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. In order to substantiate the above ratings, 'Strengths', 'Weaknesses' and 'Deficiencies' were documented for each second round potential NBAF site throughout the evaluation process. Asused in the definitions of adjectival ratings above, these terms mean the following: \"DEFICIENCY \": A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement, an omission of requested information from a proposal, or a combinationof Weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessfully meeting a Government requirement to an unacceptable level. \"STRENGTH \": A significant, outstanding, or exceptional aspect of a proposal that has merit and exceeds a Government requirement. \"WEAKNESS \": An aspect of a proposal that partially satisfies a Government requirement and thus increases the risk of successfully meeting the overall Government requirement. 6Sub-Criteria Site Proximity to Existing Research Programs A (medical/veterinary/agriculture) that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements Description for consideration when evaluating the above sub-criteria: iExisting scientific work with threat agents Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF At each step in the evaluation process, from each Individual Reviewer on the Criteria Committee to the Steering Committee's recommendation to me as the Selection Authority, comments and ratings were provided and refined for each second round potential NBAF site. Each adjectival rating was supported by numerical values. The numerical ratings provided more accurate consolidation of multiple individual and committee criteria/sub-criteria ratings into an overall recommendation, as well as provided for better resolution between multiple sites that fell within a single adjectival rating category. In addition, to account for the guidance andrecommendations from the Interagency Working Group and the DHS preferences identified in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests, each criteria and sub-criteria were weighted in order of importance. The sub-criteria weightings reflected the DHS preferences stated in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests. Numerical Rating Adjectival Rating 90-100 Excellent 80-89 Very Good70-79 Satisfactory50-69 Marginal<50 Insufficient Score An Evaluation Tool was developed to support each of the evaluation process steps, integrate criteria and sub-criteria weightings, and facilitate necessary documentation and reporting functions throughout the process. The tool was used by Individual Reviewers to capture ratings and comments regarding the sub-criteria for each site and by the Criteria Committees during their meetings to provide an overview of multiple comment/rating inputs to facilitate thedevelopment of the Criteria Committees' consensus comments and ratings. Finally, each Criteria Committee consolidated its inputs to provide a final committee report to the Steering CommitteeChair that was a summary of the review of the EOI, Additional Information, and site visits as they related to that Criteria Committee's evaluation criteria and applicable DHS preferences. Evaluation Criteria As set forth in the published \"Request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for Potential Sites for the NBAF,\" the four evaluation criteria for the EOI submissions were: 1) Research Capabilities 2) Workforce 3) Acquisition/Construction/Operations, and 4) Community Acceptance. Each criterion was then further defined into weighted sub-criteria as follows: Research Capabilities Criteria 7iExisting vaccine development iExisting diagnostic assay development iExisting pathogenesis programs in infectious diseases iProximity to other DHS/USDA/HHS programs (collaborations with HHS/USDA/HHS programs in other areas will be necessary in any case and would ensure that we have the capability to achieve the necessary synergy) Related topics from the December 2006 Additional Information Requests : iDescribe the research environment related to the NBAF mission requirements within proximity of the proposed site with examples of formal mechanisms of exchange between the veterinary, agricultural, and public health communities. iProvide information on vaccine industry capabilities, agricultural research programs, and existing animal disease research programs relevant to the NBAF mission that are in proximity to the site.

Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Preferences As identified in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests, DHS gave strong preference to the following factors that aligned to the above criteria during the evaluation of the second round potential NBAF sites. The preferences reflected the priorities of DHS in evaluating the sites. These preferences were integrated into the weighting for each of the sub-criteria identified previously. The following DHS preferences were communicated in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests to the second round potential NBAF sites and are listed in no particular order of importance: x The proposed site is within a comprehensive research community that has existing research programs in areas related to the NBAF mission requirements (veterinary, medical and public health, and agriculture). x The proposed site is within proximity to skilled research and technical staff with expertise in operations conducted at biological and agricultural research facilities. Theproposed site is within proximity to training programs to develop skilled research and technical staff with the needed expertise. x The title to the proposed minimum 30 acre site would be deeded at no cost or minimal cost to the Federal Government (in-kind contribution, sale, or quit claim). DHS would be able to construct the entire NBAF (BSL-3 and BSL4 laboratories) at the 30 acre site. x In-kind contributions [e.g., deeded land at no cost rather than sale, new utility provisions and/or upgrades (e.g., sewer, electricity, water, chilled water, steamed water, etc.), and new roadways] would be offered to DHS (by the consortium, state government, local government, or private entities). 15Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF x The proposing consortium demonstrates that the consortium itself, or other organizations within proximity to the site, will assist DHS in the National Environmental ProtectionAct (NEPA) process to conduct the environmental analysis at the proposed site. x The proposing consortium demonstrates that local and national agriculture stakeholder community members (e.g., local and national agricultural associations) support or, at a minimum, do not oppose locating the NBAF at the proposed site. 16Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Decision Overview Based on the final evaluation results presented by the Steering Committee, as reported to and discussed with me by the Steering Committee Chairperson, I evaluated the informationsubmitted by the consortia and personally visited each second round potential NBAF site, givingcareful consideration to each of the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences set forth in the Site Selection Plan and their relative weighting. The adjectival ratings and corresponding numericalscores appearing in the following discussion of the proposed sites (both those I selected and those I did not select as reasonable altern atives in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process) result from the evaluation process followed by the Criteria Committees and the Steering Committee. This evaluation process is described at the beginning of this Final Selection Memorandum. I took the Steering Committee's adjectivalratings and numerical scores for each site into strong consideration; but, as my discussion below illustrates and as the Selection Authority, I at times placed emphasis on certain strengths I saw in a proposal which offset certain weaknesses. On other occasions, I found certain proposal's weaknesses as more insurmountable than the Steering Committee had and, accordingly, those weaknesses offset the proposal's strengths. I selected five (5) sites from the seventeen (17) second round potential sites for the NBAF to advance as reasonable alternatives in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental ImpactStatement Process. I selected these five (5) sites which are listed in no particular order of importance [Manhattan, KS; Athens, GA at South Milledge Ave.; San Antonio, TX at Texas Research Park; Granville County, NC; and Madison County, MS at Flora Industrial Park] because I found they offered the best benefit to the Government based upon the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences and, importantly, met the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate the NBAF. Given the weaknesses and/or deficiencies I found amongst the seven (7) sites proposed by consortia that are not moving forward in the process, I determined that those seven (7) sites which are listed in no particular order of importance [Columbia, MO; Beltsville, MD; CollegeStation, OK; and Pulaski County, KY] do not offerthe best benefit to the Government and do not meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate the NBAF. Amongst those consortia that are moving forward in the process and which also proposed multiple sites, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from each of those consortia which provided the best benefit to the Government. I therefore did not choose an additional (5) sites to move forward in the process [Leavenworth, KS; Athens, GA at College Station Rd.; San Antonio, TX at SW Foundation; San Antonio, TX at Brooks-City Base; and Rankin County, MS]. Decision - Sites Selected I determined that each of the following sites, listed in no particular order of importance, should go forward as reasonable alternatives in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental ImpactStatement Process. The rational for my decision is elaborated in the discussion which follows. 17Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Consortium Proposed Location Heartland BioAgro Consortium Manhattan, KS Kansas State University Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security Athens, GA UGA/South Milledge Ave. Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium San Antonio, TX Texas Research Park North Carolina Consortium for the NBAF Granville County, NC Umstead Research Farm The Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium Madison County, MS Flora Industrial Park Heartland BioAgro Consortium, Manhattan, KS Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 94 Excellent83 Very Good 91 Excellent94 Excellent91 Excellent I selected the site in Manhattan, KS, submitted by the Heartland BioAgro Consortium, to advance as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental ImpactStatement Process. The comprehensive package submitted by this consortium demonstratedsignificant strength in each of the four evaluation criteria as well as DHS's preferences communicated to the consortia in the December 2006 Additional Information Requests. The proposed site is located near Kansas State University (KSU) which provides the site proximity to existing research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements. Thesite is near the KSU College of Veterinary Medicine and the KSU College of Agriculture. A unique asset within proximity of the site is the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI), which provides capacity for large animal BSL-3ag studies, scientists with expertise relevant to the NBAF mission, and training facilities in biosecurity. While some of the Workforce Committeemembers commented that competing nationally for the best senior scientists would be a challenge because of the distance of the site from Kansas City, I found the distinct advantages of being near the new Biosecurity Research Institute (with BSL-3 and BSL-3Ag facilities), and nearthe KSU Colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture to be a significant strength thatoutweighed these concerns. In summary, the location near a college campus offers opportunities for collaboration with an intellectual and scientif ic community that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements. 18Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF The consortium offered a very attractive site package. The Kansas legislature has authorized providing 48 acres (readily expandable to 70 acres) in Manhattan, Kansas via quitclaim deed to DHS, subject to a final Record of Decision to locate NBAF at the Manhattan site. There is no expiration date on this offer. The site is als o attractively located directly adjacent to the BRI. The Consortium also committed to offering significant funds that may be reallocated as appropriate to a Research and Development Program & Fellowship Program. Of this amount the consortium suggested $14.15M for utilities which are readily available. The consortium also offered the use of the BRI to transition Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) work, forlong term use if still needed by DHS after NBAF is built, and for personnel and workforce training. I found this in-kind contribution package offered by the consortium to be a significant strength as it is comprehensive and beneficial to ensuring the success of the NBAF project. Inote that the Manhattan site is about a 2 hour and 15 minute drive from Kansas City International Airport which is a little above the 2 hour drive time that DHS specified in its acquisition/construction/ operations evaluation criteria. Given the site's strengths in the other acquisition/construction/operations evaluation criteria, however, the additional 15 minute drivetime to an international airport is not an insurmountable weakness. Additionally, the consortium demonstrated a continuing commitment to NBAF and has garnered and maintained significant community acceptance and public support for the program. Supportis strong and broad from political, business, agricultural, and academic stakeholders. The coherent and persistent messaging and continuous outreach from the consortium on the benefits of placing the NBAF at this location continues to foster public support. There is no known public opposition to locating the NBAF at this site. Overall, the Manhattan, KS site has significant strengths in that it provides proximity to existing research programs relevant to the NBAF mission and a scientific community on the KSU campus with expertise relevant to the NBAF mission. This is coupled with a very attractive site package and community acceptance of the project. Based on DHS's evaluation criteria and preferences, this site will meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate the NBAF. Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security, Athens, GA (S. Milledge Ave.) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 88 Very Good 85 Very Good 97 Excellent90 Excellent90 Excellent I selected the site in Athens, GA (S. Milledge Ave.) submitted by the Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The comprehensive package submitted by this consortium demonstrated significant strength in each of the four evaluation criteria as well asDHS's preferences communicated to the consortia in the December 2006 Additional InformationRequests. 19Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF The site has significant strength due to the pote ntial for collaboration between existing research programs and the future NBAF. This site is near the USDA-ARS Richard B. Russell Research Center and the Southeast Poultry Research La boratory (SEPRL) that works on avian and vector- borne infectious diseases. SEPRL operates 1 of only 4 USDA-ARS BSL-3AG facilities (since 1976) and the only one dedicated to avian species. Additionally, the site is near the mainUniversity of Georgia (UGA) campus which includes an Agriculture College, College of Veterinary Medicine, and a new medical school to be created in Athens (announced since the EOI was submitted) and the first class of medical students will matriculate in fall 2009. This would provide the NBAF with a campus environment including highly relevant research and teaching activities. Furthermore, the site is near Merial Ltd., an animal health care company with vaccine development and production capability. The extensive research programs of the Center for Disease Control and Emory University (and Georgia Tech for engineering) are located 60miles away in Atlanta. While the consortium offe rs no clear evidence of integration with the biomedical research community and the research focus tends to be on poultry, collectively there is quite significant expertise in research on infectious diseases and pathogenesis of animals and humans, as well as zoonoses. This site offers proximity to a strength of world class capabilitiesacross disciplines related to the NBAF mission. The consortium proposed 66 acres, with no known environmental issues and which provides the opportunity for a secure site, via quit claim deed to DHS. This requires approval by the University System Board of Regents, which already indicated support via letter. The consortium also offered to provide a pad ready site that includes all utilities as well as onsite capacities to produce steam, distilled, and chilled water. Additionally, the Emory BSL3/4 laboratories andAthens Community College offered training programs for NBAF workers. The consortium also offered to build a NBAF support building to promote research interaction. The site is approximately 75 miles from the Harsfield-Jackson International Airport and the drive takes roughly 1.5 hours in morning rush hour traffic. It is also attractive that the area is rich in high containment laboratory building expertise and has very low building costs from a national perspective. The Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security appears to have garnered strong community support which is a significant strength. The consortium has strong comprehensivesupport from the academic community, Georgia state agencies, agriculture groups, civic groups,economic development groups, the Governor, the Georgia State Senate and the Congressional Delegation. The consortium has also established comprehensive outreach and communications plans to foster strong community acceptance of the project, including an informative web site (http://uga.edu/nbaf ). This would assist DHS in the NEPA process. Overall, the Athens, GA (S. Milledge Ave.) site's significant strengths include proximity to research programs and a scientific community on the UGA campus, an attractive site package, and community acceptance. Based on DHS's evaluation criteria and preferences, this site will meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate NBAF. 20Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium, San Antonio, TX (Texas Research Park) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 87 Very Good 91 Excellent95 Excellent93 Excellent91 Excellent I selected the site in San Antonio, TX (Texas Research Park), submitted by the Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium (TBAC), to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. While there was someconcern amongst members of the Research Committee over the site's lack of proximity to someresearch programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements, I determined that this weakness could easily offset by the site's strengths including its proximity to the biomedicalresearch community and BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, community acceptance, and the attractive site package. A significant strength is that the site offers the ability for strong collaboration with some of the other entities within immediate proximity of the site. The Texas Research Park (TRP) includes the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), the University of Texas Institute of Biotechnology, Department of Molecular Medicine, the South Texas Center for Biology in Medicine, and the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. UTHSCSA is among the top 5% of universities in National Institute of Health (NIH) funding and has strong research programs in microbiology, immunology, and infectious diseases. San Antonio institutions have approximately 50 principal investigators working with infectious diseases and immunology, each with at least one federal grant. The Southwest Foundation for BiomedicalResearch (SFBR) conducts NIH-funded biomedical research on the detection, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of select agents. University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) conducts research on emerging infectious diseases, select agents and cellular response to pathogenicthreats. The Texas Research Park site also provides close proximity to the biomedical research community which is a great strength. The site is within proximity to a BSL-4 laboratory which has been operating for a number of years which offers leverage opportunities for the NBAF. There are a multitude of BSL-3 laboratories within proximity to the proposed site, including theClinical Reference Laboratory for the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Site proximity to workforce availability and research programs includes a very strong military veterinary infrastructure, which has significant experience with exotic animal diseases worldwide. While the area lacks Colleges of Agriculture and VeterinaryMedicine, a local university has just completed the construction of a pharmacy school and has expressed interest in building a veterinary school for South Texas. The consortium offered 100 acres at the Texas Research Park (TRP) by Special Warranty Deed, free and clear of all encumbrances. No further approval is required for the Government to acquire the land since the Texas Research & Technology Foundation (TRTF) owns the land. 21Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF The ease of land conveyance to the Government is a significant strength. The TRP is a 1000 acre industrial district 4 miles outside of the San Antonio city limits that provides opportunity for a secure site. TRTF acts as an innovation-based economic developer for San Antonio by supporting the growth of bioscience and technology-based industries. The Texas Research Park site is especially well suited to avoid future encroachment from residential development, and the site has no known environmental issues. In addition, the consortium plans to utilize the enterprise fund, emerging technology fund, and the skill development fund to provide a pad-ready site. Skilled workers for the construction of biocontainment facilities are readily available in San Antonio, as the SFBR BSL-4 laboratory and number of BSL-3 laboratories have been constructed in the past ten years using local architects, engineers, and contractors. The site is roughly 26 miles from the San Antonio International Airport. Community support is strong and extremely diverse from an agricultural, business, science, academic, and citizenry base. Plans are already in place to continue engaging neighborhood groups, community groups, stakeholders, and media. I selected this site due to its significant strengths including its proximity to NBAF mission relevant research programs and researchers at several academic and research centers in San Antonio (including SFBR with a BSL-4 laboratory, the University of Texas Health SciencesCenter, and several military laboratories in the area), the attractive site package, and the strong community support. Based on DHS's evaluation criteria and preferences, this site will meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate NBAF. North Carolina Consortium for the NBAF, Granville County, NC (Umstead Research Farm) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 96 Excellent93 Excellent92 Excellent95 Excellent94 Excellent I selected the site in Granville County, NC (Umstead Research Farm), submitted by the North Carolina Consortium for the NBAF, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. A significant strength is thecritical mass of intellectual and sc ientific capital, comprised of universities, the private sector, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, all within proximity to the site and that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements. Additionally, the consortium's approach to communityacceptance and its attractive site package would help to ensure the success of the NBAF mission. This site provides excellent proximity to a research environment which would foster collaborations between human and animal health research programs and between agriculture and public health research programs. The consortium, led by North Carolina State University, includes a number of universities, state agencies and commodity advocacy groups, and leverages the significant concentration of many of these institutions in the North Carolina Research 22Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Triangle area. The State of North Carolina has two land grant universities, a veterinary school, four medical colleges and an outstanding public health school at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The North Carolina State University Veterinary School has a Center for the Study of Comparative Medicine and Translational Research. Collectively, the site provides proximity to the requisite range of disciplines in the agricultural, biological, medical and veterinary sciences, and includes currently funded programs on infectious agents (including select agents research since 2003 at the Southeast Regional Center of Excellence for EmergingDiseases and Biodefense). There are twenty-two BSL-3 facilities at consortium institutions.Numerous vaccine production facilities are within proximity to the site, including Merck and AlphaVax. The consortium could assist the NBAF to leverage the consortium's extensivecolloborative relationships with other universities, established federal laboratories (e.g., USDA APHIS), and entities within the vaccine and biotechnology industries. Of significant strength is the site's proximity to skilled staff and training opportunities for biocontainment facility operations. The North Carolina Triangle area is consistently ranked as one of the best areas to live (and retire) in the country, and should be a significant plus for recruiting at all levels. Biomanufacturing firms and biotechnology research and developmentprograms within the area, coupled with 24 BSL-3's, provides a strong base for a skilled workforce. In addition, three area universities (Duke University, University of North Carolina, and North Carolina State University) offer significant opportunities to draw and train a skilled workforce. The North Carolina Department of Commerce also committed to providing assistance to attract and train a skilled workforce with relevant expertise. Finally, the North CarolinaCommunity College System pledged State funded customized training for NBAF laboratory technicians and support workers. The consortium offered two high ground parcels for $1 sale within the Umstead Research Farm; 104 acres (Parcel A) or, 178 acres (Parcel B), pending approval from the North Carolina Council of State. The site is on a relatively isolated farm location, but in a region where similar facilities have been built and operate successfully. There are numerous architecture and engineering firmsin the region with BSL-4 laboratory and BSL-3 laboratory construction experience. TheGovernor of North Carolina, in conjunction with Granville County, committed to ensuring that the required utilities are extended to the site. The site is roughly 27 miles from the Raleigh Durham International Airport. The consortium garnered strong political support from local, state, and national leaders and governments at all levels. Also, its public relations, stakeholder outreach and media strategies have been active, broad, and largely successful. Overall, the Granville County, North Carolina (Umstead Research Farm) site provides several significant strengths in its proximity to research programs that can be linked to NBAF missionrequirements and a scientific community in the North Carolina Research Triangle area, an attractive site package, and extensive community acceptance. Based on the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, this site will meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate the NBAF. 23Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF The Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium, Madison County, MS (Flora Industrial Park) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 72 Satisfactory75 Satisfactory93 Excellent93 Excellent81 Very Good I selected the site in Madison County, Mississippi (Flora Industrial Park), submitted by the Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Noticeof Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The consortium's approach to community acceptance and the in-kind contribution package was comprehensive and far-reaching. The consortium's unique proposal to utilize Battelle (a consortium member) toestablish research programs within proximity to the site that can be linked to NBAF missionrequirements and to re-locate and/or train a skilled workforce with relevant expertise withinproximity to the site helped the site overcome what otherwise would have been a significant weakness in its lack of proximity to both existing research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements and a workforce with relevant expertise. I note that the Research andWorkforce Committees provided the consortium low scores in both the Research and Workforce evaluation categories and, while I take the Committ ees' concerns to heart, I do not concur with the low scores they assigned for their respective evaluation criteria due to the Battelle led consortium's proposed workaround (\"when built, they come\") which I found to be a significant strength offsetting what otherwise would have been a significant weakness. While Research and Workforce Committee members noted concerns about recruiting opportunities for necessary workforce at all levels to support the NBAF if it were located at the proposed site, Battelle (a consortium member) committed to recruiting knowledgeable staff with relevant expertise to work on research programs it will establish within proximity to the site. As a global science and technology enterprise that develops and commercializes technology and manages laboratories for a variety of entities, Battelle operates BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, including the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), and has access to trained personnel. Battelle has strong in-house training programs for laboratory and animal research support staff and would assist in bringing these training programs within proximity to the site and the local community in Mississippi. Furthermore, Battelle and other consortium members offer scientific and operational expertise in managing large national laboratories, BSL-3 facilities, veterinary medicine programs, and agriculture research programs.Jackson, Mississippi offers attractive housing and a very low cost of living for recruiting all levels of NBAF staff. The consortium offered a very attractive site that provides opportunity for both high security and development potential. The consortium also offered substantial in-kind contributions. The 150 acres in the Flora Industrial Park that would be deeded (at no cost) to the Government offers the Government excellent opportunities to satisfy DHS physical security requirements. The site is a mixed-use commercial park 45 miles from the Jackson-Evers International Airport. Additional land is available surrounding the site for support facilities. The Mississippi Development 24Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Authority committed funds to provide all needed infrastructure improvements and a pad ready site and the Mississippi Governor committed to additional funding if needed. Additionally, the City of Flora or Madison County would assist in receiving waivers for local construction, water, and sewer fees. Finally, the Madison County Economic Development Authority commiteed to assemble a package of assistance for persons moving to Madison County to work at the NBAF. It is of note that the Government would have to rely upon out of state BSL-4 laboratory construction contractors, as there is little expertis e with the building of such facilities in the state, however this weakness is offset by the significant strengths in the acquisition/operations/construction evaluation criteria. Community acceptance for the proposed site is excellent and a significant strength. The local and area communities have been involved from the start of the consortium's proposal. There has been no observed organized opposition to NBAF in Mississippi at this time. The consortium presented the local communities with factual information more than a year ago and before it submitted the original Expression of Interest. Broad newspaper coverage in the Jackson and surrounding area has created a positive public forum for the NBAF. Awareness and public acceptance appears high. Issues openly discussed at public meetings were economicopportunities to the area and state, safety concerns about the facility or environment, and security issues. Additionally, the consortium obtained over 300 letters of support from the general public,civic organizations, agriculture associations, public health groups, local/state/national elected officeholders, business groups, the media, and the religious community. Overall, the Madison County, Mississippi (Flora Industrial Park) site provides significant strengths in its extensive community acceptance, attractive site package, and proposal to utilize Battelle (a consortium member) to bring in scientific and operational expertise within proximityto the site. Based on the evaluation criteria and DHS's preferences, this site will meet the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate NBAF. 25Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Decision - Sites Not Selected I determined that each of the following sites, listed in no particular order, should not go forward as reasonable alternatives in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact StatementProcess. The rationale for my decision is elaborated in the discussion which follows. Consortium Proposed Location Heartland BioAgro Consortium Leavenworth, KS Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security College Station Rd, Athens, GA Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium SW Foundation, San Antonio, TX University of Missouri at Columbia NBAF Consortium Columbia, MO Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium Brooks City-Base, TX Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium Beltsville, MD Texas A&M University and the NBAF Consortium College Station, TX Wisconsin Consortium Madison, WI University of California Site 300 in CA Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium Rankin County, MS Oklahoma State University Consortium El Reno, OK Kentucky and Tennessee NBAF Consortium Pulaski County, KY The Heartland BioAgro Consortium, Leavenworth, KS Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 93 Excellent92 Excellent90 Excellent94 Excellent92 Excellent I did not select the site in Leavenworth, KS, submitted by the Heartland BioAgro Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF EnvironmentalImpact Statement Process. The site in Leavenworth, Kansas was offered by the same consortium that offered the Manhattan, Kansas site. As seen in the discussion of the site in Manhattan, Kansas, this consortium offered a second site in Leavenworth with several significant strengths including proximity to existing research programs that can be linked to th e NBAF mission and proximity to a skilled workforce with relevant expertise. The Leavenworth site also was an attractive site package and there was 26Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF extensive community support. However, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from this consortium which would provide the best benefit to the Government and I chose the Manhattan site rather than the Leavenworth site. While the Workforce Committee preferred the Leavenworth site over the Manhattan site due to the Leavenworth site's proximity to Kansas City which would also be beneficial for recruiting purposes and for two income families, I found that the proximity of the site in Manhattan to the Biosecurity Research Institute and the KSU College of Veterinary Medicine offered a significant strengths as it provides a wonderful opportunity for collaboration and leveraging of the extensive agriculture and animal research programs at KSU. Additionally, biocontainment facilities have been built at KSU at low construction cost and theManhattan site provided less cost risk to the project than the Leavenworth site because of the more readily available utilities. Finally, the site in Leavenworth abutted a prison and I found this to be a weakness as I was concerned that the adjacent prison could pose operational and security uncertainties. I therefore did not select the Leavenworth site to move forward in the process. The Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security, Athens, GA (College Station Rd.) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 88 Very Good 85 Very Good 97 Excellent90 Excellent90 Excellent I did not select the site in Athens, GA (College Station Rd.), submitted by the Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The site in Athens, GA (College Station Rd.) was offered by the same consortium that offered the Athens, GA (Milledge Ave.) site. As seen in the discussion of the Milledge Road site, the College Station Rd. site provides significant strengths with its proximity to research programsand a scientific community on the UGA campus, attractive site package, and communityacceptance. However, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from this consortium which would provide the best benefit to the Government and I chose the Milledge Ave. site rather than the College Station Rd. site. I found the two sites to be almost equal, however the College Station Road site had potential floodplain issues and a nearby facility was about to undergo a major construction and renovation project. I found this to be a weakness as I was concerned that the planned construction in the area and the limited access road to the College Station Rd. site could cause a schedule risk for the NBAF construction project. I therefore did not select the College Station Road site to move forward in the process. 27Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium, San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 86 Very Good 90 Excellent87 Very Good 93 Excellent88 Very Good I did not select the site in San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) submitted by the Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The site in San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) was offered by the same consortium that offered the San Antonio, TX (TX Research Park) and the San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) sites. As seen in the discussion of the TX Research Park site (which I did select), the San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) site provides strengths with its proximity to relevant research programs, a skilled workforce with relevant expertise, an attractive site package, and community acceptance. However, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from this consortium which would provide the best benefit to the Government and I chose the San Antonio, TX (TX Research Park) site rather than the San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) site. While the San Antonio, TX (SWFoundation) site was attractive in that it was next to a neighboring BSL-4 facility, due diligence was not performed with respect to site suitability which I found to be a weakness. For example,Tract A has a non-human primate house that requires relocation prior to site development and Tract B has Slick Ranch Creek intersecting the site. Additionally, it would be costly to provide steam, chilled water, and distilled water which were not currently available at the site. When the consortium was asked about these hindrances it was stated that associated costs would be the responsibility of the Government. I therefore did not select the SW Foundation site to moveforward in the process. University of Missouri at Columbia NBAF Consortium, Columbia, MO Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 92 Excellent88 Very Good 84 Very Good 87 Very Good 89 Very Good I did not select the site in Columbia, MO submitted by the University of Missouri at Columbia NBAF Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for theNBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. This site's strength was its proximity to significant research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements and high quality science and technology activities in the region. The site was also within reasonable proximity to a network of universities, federal laboratories, 28Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF and private industry with expertise in medicine, animal health, veterinary diagnostics, vaccines, and agriculture. The consortium offered outstanding collaboration and interface opportunities between the veterinary and medical schools which are both located on campus. Despite this significant strength in proximity to relevant research programs and a workforce with relevantexpertise, I was greatly concerned with an offsetting significant weakness: the growing negative community feedback and the consortium's failure to initiate community outreach soon enough. I recognize that the consortium has since made great strides in developing an excellent community outreach plan, but the growing community opposition appears to continue and I found it could impede and prolong the NEPA EIS process. The site visit team observed demonstrators againstthe NBAF during the site visit. Additionally, the site does not provide a reasonable buffer to adjoining residential areas. The consortium's lack of due diligence or full disclosure of potentialsite impedances, such as the petroleum utility line running through the northwest corner of thesite, was also a weakness and gives me cause for concern. Finally, the consortium offered no funding commitment for in-kind contributions for investments in required utilities. The consortium stated that it would continue to pursue funding if selected for further consideration;however this lack of commitment is a weakness and could impede the success of the NBAF construction. I therefore did not select the Columbia, MO site to move forward in the process. Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium, San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 86 Very Good 90 Excellent94 Excellent93 Excellent90 Excellent I did not select the site in San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base), submitted by the Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The site in San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) was offered by the same consortium that offered the San Antonio, TX (TX Research Park) and the San Antonio, TX (SW Foundation) sites. As seen in the discussion of the TX Research Park site (which I did select) the San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) site offers strengths including proximity to relevant research programs, a skilled workforce with relevant expertise, an attractive site package, and community acceptance. However, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from this consortium which would provide the best benefit to the Government and I choose the San Antonio, TX (TX Research Park) site rather than the San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) site. While the proximity to the laboratories at Brooks City-Base was a substantial benefit, the San Antonio, TX (Brooks City-Base) site does not offer an adequate buffer to adjacent residential areas which is an offsetting weakness and I was also concerned about a wetland that is 1000 feet away that would require special care during construction and operations. Considering these weaknesses and the offer by the consortium that the access to the laboratories on Brooks City-Base would still be available regardless of which site in Texas was chosen, I decided that the TX Research Park site offered 29Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF more benefits to ensuring the success of the NBAF. I therefore did not select the Brooks City- Base site to move forward in the process. Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium, Beltsville, MD Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 90 Excellent88 Very Good 89 Very Good 82 Very Good 88 Very Good I did not select the site in Beltsville, MD, submitted by the Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. A strength of the site is that it is within proximity to existing research programs that can be linked to the NBAF mission and it is also within proximity to a workforce with extensiveexperience with BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory operations. Such expertise includes work with a variety of human and animal viruses, biologically-derived toxins, and select agents. However I have many areas of concerns regarding offsetting weaknesses. A significant weakness is that theconsortium did not adequately investigate what each of the consortium's four proposed land conveyance and/or land use scenarios at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) would entail, which would expose DHS to unnecessary risk and uncertainty. Any land transfer at the BARC to DHS requires congressional approval since the land is owned by USDA. Additionally, no chilled or distilled water capabilities were available on the site and such capabilities would be dependant upon BARC's success in obtaining capital improvement funding through USDA's normal appropriations process. This would pose additional risk to DHS or, at a minimum, additional cost. I'm also concerned about the weakness I found with respect to the ability to attract a skilled workforce to the NB AF given that there would be significant competition to attract talent given the other biocont ainment facilities that are already operating in the region (including those under construction such as the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) at Fort Detrick, Maryland). I question the wisdom of locating DHS's only biocontainment facilities within approximately 40 miles of each other from a workforce recruiting perspective as well as from the perspective of Homeland Security continuity of operations planning in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack in the greater National Capital Region. Finally, much of the community acceptance efforts have yet to beacted upon which is a weakness. For example, plans for future communications and dealing with opposition were not fully implemented and community engagement was limited to the immediatecommunity without outreach to the greater region. The failure to satisfy the DHS preference for ease of land use and/or transfer, the potential challenges to recruiting a skilled workforce given the competing needs of the multiple other biocon tainment facilities in the area, the lack of clear community acceptance, and the lack of in-kind contributions causes significant risk to the success of NBAF project. I therefore did not select the Beltsville, MD site to move forward in the process. 30Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF Texas A&M University and the NBAF Consortium, College Station, TX Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 86 Very Good 82 Very Good 88 Very Good 90 Excellent86 Very Good I did not select the site in College Station, TX, submitted by the Texas A&M University and the NBAF Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for theNBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. While the site has a significant strength given its proximity to research programs that parallel the NBAF mission, I have serious concerns caused by a significant, offsetting weakness which is that some of these research programs have had issues with institutional oversight and management of biocontainment safety procedures and compliance with federal select agent regulations. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently suspended Texas A&M University's federal research on some infectious diseases after at least one case in which the school failed to report researchers' exposure to select agents as required by Federal regulations. Additionally, the coordination between the medical and veterinary institutions for research programs within proximity to the site are not fully demonstrated. The location to the Texas A&M campus provides an excellent opportunity for collaboration, however this location presents a challenge to recru iting and retaining a robust workforce given the distance of College Station from major metropolitan areas and lack of diverse employmentopportunities, especially for dual-employment households. This recruitment challenge is a weakness. I noted the collaborative benefit for research program if the NBAF were located onthe proposed 30 acre site which is adjacent to the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and the College of Medicine. However, the site has a weakness in that it is also within very close proximity of the airport's airplane approach and departure trajectories, creating safety and potential anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) concerns. My concerns with the recent findings by the CDC regarding Texas A&M's lack of compliance with federal select agent regulations that occurred among some of the research programs being run within the proximity to the proposed site, coupled with the potential workforce recruiting challenge and the airport approach/departure are weaknesses which outweighed the strength of the site's proximityto research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements. I therefore did not select the College Station, TX site to move forward in the process. Wisconsin Consortium, Madison, WI Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 91 Excellent89 Very Good 77 Satisfactory75 Satisfactory85 Very Good 31Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF I did not select the site in Madison, WI submitted by the Wisconsin Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact StatementProcess. This site offered proximity to strong research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and human health as well as a strong and deliberate effort to facilitate collaborations and integration. Despite the noted strength in the proximity of the site to research programs and a workforce with relevant expertise, there was a significant weakness caused by the lack of the community's acceptance of the NBAF and I found this weakness cannot be offset nor overcome. The consortium's success in collaborative efforts between disciplines, divisions, and partners to accomplish its targeted goals is impressive. However, it appears that the consortium's lack of efforts at the onset of the EOI process to garner local community input and support has been detrimental and fostered the growth of the current significant local community anti-NBAF campaign. For example, the Dane County Board of Supervisors (local elected officials) voted to oppose the location of NBAF at the proposed site. Additionally, residents of the Town of Dunn expressed vocal opposition to locating NBAF at this site, including organized protests during the site visit and a substantial letter campaign opposing the site. Finally, the Town of Dunn Land Use Manager stated that \"it is highly unlikely that the proposed site will ever have sewer service\". This is a particular problem because the site cannotreceive sewer service unless it is added to a sanitary district and the procedure for adding the proposed site to the sanitary district requires Town Board approval (which is clearly not forthcoming given the Town Board's opposition to the NBAF). I determined that the firm opposition from both the local members of the public, coupled with the documented support of their elected officials to block the Government from achieving the necessary milestones for placement of the NBAF at this location, creates a serious impediment to the program's success that will be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The risk and uncertainty for DHS is too great to pursue this option despite the site's proximity to strong research programs that can be linked to NBAF mission requirements. I therefore did not select the Madison, WI site to moveforward in the process. University of California, Site 300, CA Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 85 Very Good 84 Very Good 82 Very Good 84 Very Good 84 Very Good I did not select the site on Site 300 in CA, su bmitted by the University of California, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental ImpactStatement Process. This site offers proximity to strong research programs at LLNL; however, may of these research programs are not focused on the NBAF mission areas of agriculture, veterinary medicine, and human health. The University of California has a world class faculty and staff in pertinent 32Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF research areas to NBAF mission requirements; however the University of California Davis capabilities are over 80 miles away and some relevant University of California campuses are over 300 miles away. The extent to which some of the consortium's partners, such as Stanford and UC San Francisco, would be involved on collaborative research efforts is unclear. It is noteworthy, however, that the San Francisco Bay area has outstanding biotech and vaccine industry capabilities. It was a weakness that the consortium did not do more due diligence with the Department of Energy headquarters, which owns Site 300, to propose to DHS how exactlythe consortium would propose transferring Site 300 to DHS or allow DHS to use the site for the NBAF's lengthy lifespan. This lack of due diligence creates uncertainty for DHS. Most importantly, despite the site's proximity to research programs (many of which, however, do not fall within NBAF mission requirements) and a highly skilled workforce, there were significantobstacles in the community acceptance evaluation criteria causing a significant weakness thatcould not be offset nor overcome. While the consortium has gathered initial baseline information regarding the community acceptance of the NBAF, it is relying upon its experienceand benchmarks with past LLNL projects. Despite the consortium's experience that would assist DHS during the NEPA process, there are several examples of growing community opposition that would be difficult to overcome. For example, the Tracy City Council voted 3 to 1 against siting NBAF at the proposed site. Additionally, the only BSL-3 facility at LLNL has never beencommissioned due to community opposition and pending legal action. DHS would assume evenmore risk in proposing to construct and operate a BSL-4 facility at the LLNL site. Finally, three citizen groups (Tri-Valley Cares, No Bio-Lab for Tracy, and Tracy: Tomorrow and Beyond) have presented strong, organized opposition to NBAF and the NBAF mission. Collectively thecurrent public engagement actions and the negative track record of gaining acceptance for similar bio-containment facilities at LLNL creates an increased risk for the successfulcompletion of the NEPA process and ultimate fruition of the NBAF project at this site. I therefore did not select the site on Site 300 in CA to move forward in the process. Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium, Rankin County, MS Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 72 Satisfactory75 Satisfactory91 Excellent93 Excellent81 Very Good I did not select the site in Rankin County, MS submitted by the Gulf States Bio and Agro- Defense Consortium, to go forward as a reasonabl e alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. The site in Rankin County, MS was offered by the same consortium that offered the Madison County, MS site. As seen in the discussion of the site in Madison County, MS, Battelle (a consortium member) committed to recruiting knowledable staff with relevant expertise to work on research programs that can be linked to the NBAF mission that it will establish within proximity to the Rankin County, MS site. There is also extensive community acceptance for locating the NBAF in Rankin County, MS and the consortium offered a very attractive site 33Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF package. However, I mitigated DHS's risk by picking the one site from this consortium which would provide the best benefit to the Government and I chose the Madison County, MS site rather than the Rankin County, MS site. The only differentiation between the two sites was found by the ACO Committee. The Rankin County, MS site has a daycare center and residentialhomes nearby causing potential environmental justice issues which is a weakness. Additionally, the site in Madison County offered greater flexibility in meeting DHS's security needs. I therefore did not select the Rankin County, MS site to move forward in the process. Kentucky and Tennessee NBAF Consortium, Pulaski County, KY Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 74 Satisfactory66 Marginal88 Very Good 81 Very Good 77 Satisfactory I did not select the site in Pulaski County, KY, submitted by the Kentucky and Tennessee NBAF Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. A significant weakness that was not offset is that the site lacked proximity to research capabilities that can be linked to the NBAF mission (e.g., biomedical, public health, agricultural and veterinary research programs). The site had a further significant weakness in that it also lacked proximity to a workforce with expertise relevant to the NBAF (e.g., BSL-3 laboratory operations and/or BSL-4 laboratory operations). While the site is indeed within reasonable proximity to certain veterinary research, diagnostics, and vaccine discovery programs, the majorfocus of these programs is on on equine diseases which are not especially relevant to the NBAF mission. Site isolation is a weakness with respect to the recruitment and retension of the required NBAF scientists and laboratory support. The consortium offered a 54 acre site which it would deed at no cost to DHS as well as in kind contributions for site preparation. I recognize the consortium's community outreach efforts as it has hosted news conferences, community meetings, and editorial boards and organized a community Advisory Board and met with project opponents. However, the consortium failed to address questions raised at these initial outreach sessions or to continue to engage in activities to foster community support. Subsequently,opposition groups have gained additional support and focus which is a significant weakness.Seemingly organized demonstrators chanting \"No Bio Lab\", \"Save Our Children\", and \"Go Home\" were observed picketing at the site by the site visit team. Some of the opposition groups' concerns understandably relate to the consortium's proposal to exercise eminent domain over approximately 10 family farms to create an access road to the proposed site which appears to be \"land-locked\" by small, family farms. I have concerns about the consortium's apparent lack of planning to pursue other access options or to address the community impact of exercisingeminent domain over local farms to gain necessary access to the site. Additionally, theconsortium's proposal for DHS to extend certain utilities to the site may hinge upon acquiring access rights through the small, family farms mentioned in the context of the required access road. The significant weakness of the lack of proximity to research programs and a workforce 34Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF with expertise relevant to the NBAF mission, coupled with the significant weakness caused by the community acceptance issues which may gain further momentum if eminent domain is exercised over parts of surrounding family farms, posed serious concerns about the success of the NBAF mission if placed at this site. I therefore did not select the Pulaski County, KY site to move forward in the process. Oklahoma State University Consortium, El Reno, OK Research Workforce ACO Community AcceptanceWeighted Average Rating 79 Satisfactory74 Satisfactory81 Very Good 72 Satisfactory77 Satisfactory I did not select the site in El Reno, OK submitted by the Oklahoma State University Consortium, to go forward as a reasonable alternative in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF EnvironmentalImpact Statement Process. While the site has proximity to some research programs related to agriculture, veterinary medicine, and human health within Oklahoma, overall, it has a significant weakness in that there is minimal established NBAF mission critical infrastructure and research programs within proximity to the proposed site. Another significant weakness is that it is unclear whether the proposed site is within proximity to a sufficient critical mass of staff with relevant expertise and relevant infrastructure to optimally support the NBAF mission because key institutions withinthe consortium are located in various states or at some distance from the site. The site is Withdrawn Public Doman land and is currently Federally owned property. However, a weakness is that the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe is currently litigating over ownership of the proposed site property which provides unnecessary risk and uncertainty to DHS. Regardless of the litigation's outcome, there is an increased risk of delay to the overall NBAF project schedule which must be aggressive to meet our Nation's bio and agro defense needs. Cumulatively the site litigation coupled with the lack of proximity to research programs that can be linked to NBAF missionrequirements and skilled staff with relevant expertise and training, are significant weaknesses which pose serious concerns to the success of the NBAF mission if placed at this site. I thereforedid not select the El Reno, OK site to move forward in the process. Conclusion I recognize the hard work that each consortium put in throughout this very rigorous andcompetitive process, including the effort involved with the preparation of the EOI submission,the additional information submission, and the site visit. As the Source Selection Authority for the NBAF site selection, I selected five (5) sites from the seventeen (17) second round potential sites for the NBAF to advance as reasonable alternatives in the Notice of Intent for the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement Process. I selected those five (5) sites because I found they 35Final Selection Memorandum: Site Selection for the Second Round Potential Sites for the NBAF offered the best benefit to the Government based upon the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences and, importantly, met the intended purpose and need to successfully build and operate the NBAF. The selection was made in accordance with the process described at the beginning of this Final Selection Memorandum. I made my decision using the evaluation criteria published in the\"Public Notice Soliciting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for Potential Sites for the NBAF\" which appeared in the Federal Register on January 19, 2006, the DHS preferences communicated to all second round potential NBAF sites by letter on December 8, 2006, information collected by the site visit teams during their visit to each second round potential NBAF site, and observations made by me on my personal visits to each second round potential NBAF site. My decision is the result of my integrated assessment and evaluation of the strengths, weaknesses, and risksassociated with each proposed site against DHS's evaluation criteria and preferences. 36 "}
