Although both of these are alternative medicines, they have different fields of practice and study. Naturopathy is a holistic and electric alternative medical system that focuses on the body's vital ability and medicines to cure. On the other hand, Ayurveda is a holistic approach that integrates body, mind, and soil to cure and prevent different types of ailments. Certainly, naturopathy is completely different from Ayurveda. Let's know more about their differences in detail. Understanding the approaches of Naturopathy and Ayurveda The approach of Naturopathy is based on the \"healing power of nature\" in order to cure ailments. Naturopathy basically focuses on supporting the vital force or life force by strengthening the body through modalities like nutrition, botanical medicine, physical medicine, hydropathy, and homeopathy. Naturopathy aims to harmonize energetic and biochemical balance while avoiding the use of synthetic prescription drugs and surgery, except in the case of emergencies. On the flip side, Ayurveda is a holistic approach and an ancient medicine that focuses on balance. The main focus of Ayurveda is more on creating energetic levels at the inner level. Ayurveda believes that there should be harmony between body, mind, and soul. Ayurveda names three elemental substances known as doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata. If any of these doshas get imbalanced, it results in disease. The treatment of diseases in Ayurveda is in the form of modalities like a mantra, pranayama, asana, yoga, meditation, and intake of proper [Ayurvedic Therapy](https://hiims.in/blog/understanding-ayurvedic-therapies-for-holistic-wellness/).
