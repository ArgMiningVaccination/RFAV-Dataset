Many people around the world are looking for more natural ways to heal the body and promote overall wellness. A review by Frontiers in Pharmacology found that over 80% of the global population now relies on herbal products as part of their primary healthcare strategy. Even better, this study shows that many of the medicinal products people use are extremely effective over time. That's great news if you plan to address issues with female hormone balance using herbs. From adaptogenic herbs to florals to roots and plants, the herbal world has a proven track record for helping you heal hormonal imbalances. In this article, you'll learn about 15 of the best female hormone balance herbs you have at your fingertips to boost wellness and mitigate the symptoms of female issues like PMS, PCOS, menopause, and more. 15+ Best Female Hormone Balance Herbs Can herbs and \"spices\" really act as a natural medicine for the treatment of endocrine issues? The answer is, yes! The fact is that many endocrine disorders these days occur due to environmental pollutants, chronic stress, disruptive food-based chemicals, and even toxic materials used in skincare and bedding. This includes issues like: Diabetes Adrenal fatigue Sexual dysfunction Menstrual abnormalities Hyper and hypothyroidism Since hormones are the key messengers that control almost all other body systems, this poses a real challenge for your overall health. However, science is behind the use of hormone-balancing herbs. Studies show that you can reverse, reduce, and totally eliminate effects like moodiness, changes in appetite, metabolism slow-down, aging, and anxiety, to name a few, using healing herbs that eliminate toxins and rebalance hormone levels. Let's dive deep into 15 hormone balance herbs that you can use to free yourself from hormonal imbalances starting today. Note: Many scientific studies agree that hormone balance herbs are highly effective. However, they also acknowledge that if issues arise when using hormone balance herbs, it's usually because of inaccurate dosages or poor monitoring. To give the herbs you use a chance to make a positive difference in your health, make sure that you consult your primary care physician before and while you're taking them. #1. Go With the Flow Get it now! First up is a one-hit-wonder, Go With the Flow. It's \"one-hit\" because this blend of hormone balance herbs is all you need. The collection of herbs includes many of the same plants and roots you'll see featured in the rest of this article. That means you can get the optimal doses of multiple hormone balance herbs at once and experience positive total body effects that extend beyond hormone balance and affect your mood, mental health, and energy. The hormone balance supplement, which features common female hormone balance herbs like Maca root, chasteberry, black cohosh root, Dong Quai root, and more, helps to reduce the symptoms of PMS and menopause. It also noticeably reduces physical symptoms like acne, bloating, tenderness, mood swings, and more. #2. Shatavari Get it now! Known as asparagus racemosus, Shatavari, \"queen of herbs,\" is a potent female-focused herb. Why? It naturally contains phytoestrogen and is recognized as an adaptogenic herb. This means it supports the body's ability to adapt to mental, physical, and emotional stress over time. However, as a hormone balance herb for women, Shatavari's power is its ability to balance the female hormone (estrogen). It also has anti-inflammatory properties, so it's useful for menstrual cramps. Shatavari can: Soothe the symptoms of PMS and menopause Improve and heal the symptoms of PCOS Reduces irritability, anxiety, and depression related to the ovulation cycle Boosts libido (much like Maca root) Can support nursing mothers by increasing milk supply If you're using Shatavari as a female hormone balance, make sure that you're aware of your current estrogen levels first. It works best for those who don't have excessive estrogen dominance. The herb itself is non-toxic, but estrogen dominance can lower progesterone levels, which is another important factor in female fertility. Lower progesterone levels can lead to sleep disorders, weight gain or weight loss, and fluid retention. So make sure that you're using Shatavari under the supervision of a functional medicine doctor. #3. Tribulus Terrestris Get it now! Tribulus Terrestris is an herb that's usually associated with boosting testosterone and blocking estrogen dominance. However, researchers have found that women who face sexual decline or dysfunction due to menopausal symptoms can benefit from periodic use of Tribulus as a hormone balance herb. Specifically, women can use Tribulus to: Boost libido Improve sexual arousal response Mitigate or eliminate vaginal dryness often associated with post-menopause This makes it the right herb as you transition out of menopause and into older adulthood. #4. Maca Get it now! For years, natives to the region around and in Peru have been using organic Maca root, a proven adaptogen, to boost energy levels and improve sexual function, libido, and fertility. This hormone balance herb can also help reduce the incidence of hot flashes in menopausal women. Maca works by regulating hormones that are either overly abundant in the body or helping the body to produce more of the hormones it needs. It primarily nourishes and goes to work on the pituitary and hypothalamus glands in your body. #5. Cramp Bark (Viburnum Opulus) Get it now! The guelder-rose, also known as \"cramp bark,\" is an ornamental flower native to North America. However, this hormone balance herb is very well known for its use in alleviating menstrual cramps, healing medical issues due to vitamin C deficiency, treating ulcers, and any other pain or inflammation of the uterus. As such, it can be used to: Relieve pain related to endometriosis Alleviate menstrual cramps Get an irregular cycle back on track Deal with the symptoms of PMS #6. White Peony Get it now! Paeonia lactiflora, or white peony root, is one of those herbs that are commonly used for herbal teas. However, this hormone balance herb has a long history of use as a female-focused remedy in traditional Chinese medicine. The roots of the white peony are used as an estrogen stabilizer for menstrual dysfunction (either due to PMS or because of irregular cycles). You can also address PCOS issues such as acne and bloating with white peony. Want to try tea for hormone balance? Check out our in-depth guide to hormone balance teas to get started!

Vitex agnus-castus, also known as \"chasteberry,\" is one of the best herbs for menopause. It provides progesterone support by naturally regulating the pituitary gland's production and release of the hormone. As a hormone balance herb, chasteberry has been shown to: Relieve the symptoms of endometriosis Help with infertility Prevent miscarriage in the first trimester Soothe menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes #8. Ashwagandha Get it now! Ashwagandha is an ancient, Ayurvedic herb used to calm and relieve tension, nerves, and stress. As an adaptogenic herb, however, it's perfect for balancing your body's hormones when you're going through PMS. Premenstrual syndrome comes with irritability, mood swings, and changes in energy levels, which are all symptoms that ashwagandha can help alleviate. Ashwagandha can also help cure adrenal fatigue - read up our article to learn more. #9. Motherwort Get it now! Motherwort is a noted and studied hormone balance herb for women. It offers a holistic approach to restoring total health. As a uterine tonic, it can help to regulate menstruation, reduce menstrual cramps, and promote blood flow to the pelvic region. Like ashwagandha, motherwort is also very useful for women who suffer from anxiety, which worsens during PMS or menopause. It's calming and can help you feel relaxed during the stressful phases of your cycle. #10. Black Cohosh Root Get it now! Some hormone balance herbs work directly on estrogen levels while others improve the connection between the pituitary gland and the ovaries. Black cohosh root is that kind of herb. It attends to the brain-ovary communication and acts on perimenopausal and menopausal issues by modulating the behavior of cell receptors in this communication process. You can use it to address physical symptoms, like hot flashes and night sweats, as well as depression related to perimenopause and menopause. Black cohosh root can also be used to reduce the effects of PCOS and the incidence of uterine fibroids. Black cohosh, along with chasteberry, are both parts of the Go With the Flow collection of herbs. #11. Milk Thistle Get it now! You may already have heard of milk thistle as a viable her for cleansing and detoxifying the liver. In fact, it's one of the most effective aids for fatty liver disease. However, a healthy liver is essential for hormone balance, and, when it gets knocked out of doing its job well, you may experience an excess of estrogen but a deficiency of progesterone. Milk thistle can indirectly help to restore hat balance because a healthy liver can filter out excess estrogen from the body. And since the liver is also the main organ for filtering out chemicals, heavy metals, and fungus, it can protect against the disruptive effects of these toxins on the body's hormones. #12. Suma Get it now! Suma is a Brazilian-sourced herb in the Amaranthaceae family. Its roots are used for its medicinal properties, including treating low energy levels, boosting libido, and soothing anxiety. In that way, it resembles the Maca root quite a bit.
