In recent decades, research breakthroughs have delivered vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics that have revolutionised the treatment and control of some major disease threats. Innovative global partnerships have helped expand global access to these products so more countries and communities can benefit. However, while this has drastically improved the outlook for some diseases, far too many gaps remain. Progress across different areas of infectious disease is mixed. Systems that help make new innovations to tackle disease available and accessible do not support each disease and each community equally. Disproportionate power and influence over the system is entrenched in the Global North, in the hands of a limited number of key governments, companies, and other organisations, allowing inequitable outcomes to persist. We believe that the research and development (R&D) ecosystem for infectious disease is unfit for purpose and requires ambitious reform . We also believe that there is a clear case for action now. The world is falling behind on addressing infectious disease - which is responsible for 25 percent of deaths globally - while growing systemic risks like climate change and new emerging diseases add greater urgency. As a major global funder of infectious disease R&D, and an organisation holding power within the current ecosystem, we believe that Wellcome has a key role to play in supporting the fundamental change that is so needed. Through this project, Wellcome intends to set out a vision for what a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease could look like in 20 years' time. This discussion paper is the first part of this project . Through this paper, we seek to frame some of the problems in the current landscape and put forward ideas for change in areas where we see the greatest opportunities to make progress. We know that we do not have all the answers at this stage, and that we cannot achieve the change required by ourselves. Moreover, our framing of the issues is shaped by our own experiences and standpoint, and might not resonate with other actors in the system. Therefore, with the launch of this paper, we are now embarking on a listening exercise through which we want to engage global health stakeholders across all sectors and countries, as well as communities affected by infectious disease, to provide feedback on our thinking. In doing so, we will be looking to develop and iterate ideas that are potentially transformational, rather than fixes to the status quo. This will inform a final paper we intend to publish by the end of 2023, synthesising what we've heard into a detailed Wellcome vision for a reformed infectious disease R&D ecosystem. This will also identify shorter-term policy priorities for reform, including those that Wellcome might lead on and those where others could lead in the coming years. I hope that you will be interested in sharing ideas and embarking on this journey with us. Beth Thompson Chief Strategy Officer Foreword Towards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 4Preface The year is 2003 . The Millennium Development Goals set in 2000 are already off track and the infectious disease burden is stark. Life expectancy at birth for women in rich settings like Europe, Japan and the US has risen above 80, but is less than 46 years for men in sub-Saharan Africa. This difference is largely due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has affected sub-Saharan Africa for at least a decade longer than the US and Europe, exacerbated by barriers to accessing therapies in low-income countries.1 The burden of tuberculosis (TB) is also growing,2 linked in part to HIV infections, though health information systems to monitor total burden are very limited.3 The Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the GAVI Alliance (now Gavi) and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) are new, and US President George W. Bush has set up the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The African Union is just a year old. Research on infectious disease has a long footprint, but funding is still limited and largely controlled by the Global North.4 Product manufacturing - especially for vaccines - is mostly concentrated in a few countries.5 There have been longstanding debates around inequalities in global health, but the solutions are only at their earliest stages. The world is still reeling from the emergence of a new coronavirus called SARS, which ultimately leads to 8000 cases and 900 deaths centred in Western Pacific countries. This is ended through public health measures, although no treatment or vaccine is developed.The year is 2023 . This marks the midway point to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and while progress has been made, work remains off track.6 Strides have been made in responses to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria where up to 50 million lives have been saved in 20 years due to global co-operation.7 The world's first malaria vaccine has just been approved, but it is over a century since a vaccine was last developed for TB. The World Health Organization (WHO) has evolved to better tackle outbreaks as well as pandemic influenza, while new initiatives such as CEPI and CARB-X have been set up to fill gaps in R&D. Research investment around infectious disease has grown but is still mixed, particularly lacking for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs),8 though platform technologies like messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are an exciting development.9 The maturity of regulatory systems around the world is still uneven10 and complex clinical trials can face approval issues. Manufacturing of some products is global, but for vaccines is highly concentrated in Europe and the US. Global health initiatives like Gavi and the Global Fund are well established and have successfully brokered better access to new medical products, though this has limits. The world is still reeling from the emergence of a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, the resulting pandemic leading to over 761 million cases and nearly 7 million deaths.11 Multiple Covid-19 vaccines were developed at stunning speed, building on significant investment into vaccine technologies, immunology and structural biology. However, countries with greater resources monopolised supply at the expense of the lowest-income countries. The year is 2043 . Major moves made 20 years ago to address ongoing challenges and inequities in global health have led to huge improvements in infectious disease outcomes. For example, the upward trend in TB cases has been reversed, the spectre of drug- resistant bacterial infections has been tackled, and most infectious diseases - including NTDs - are linked to flourishing research and development pipelines with a range of new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines under development. Having addressed power imbalances between countries, the global health community now focuses health spending on further strengthening health systems and controlling infectious disease threats before they escalate. More and more countries are achieving universal health coverage with climate-resilient health systems. Many more now also have research-focused health systems linked seamlessly to excellent global and local universities and innovators, supported by geographically diverse flows of research funding and research talent. The norm is that research hubs for specific diseases are rooted in communities with high burden of that disease. Years of work on regulatory and manufacturing maturity means that innovations can be approved and produced faster, regardless of country, supported by quality data from globally diverse clinical trials. Considerations around equitable access to new products are embedded in all innovation processes, and these approaches are sustainable and focused on long-term benefit. The world is better prepared to tackle the next pandemic, underpinned by robust and flexible systems that operate just as effectively when tackling day-to-day and emerging threats. PrefaceTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 5Context What's going wrong in the infectious disease R&D ecosystem? Substantial progress has been made to tackle infectious disease in recent decades. Researchers, companies, and other organisations have shown continued ingenuity in developing the products needed to detect, prevent, and treat some of the world's most devastating illnesses, saving vast numbers of lives. In some areas, new initiatives have enabled affordable, reliable access to critical products where they had previously been unobtainable. However, imbalances of power and resourcing mean that huge inequities persist. Resources are not allocated to research activities efficiently or equitably, with whole fields suffering long-term neglect that has left significant gaps in the toolkit for major infectious disease threats. At the same time, an individual's ability to access lifesaving products often depends more on economics and geography than on need. It is fundamentally a system that is not meeting the needs of those suffering the most from infectious disease. While there are many challenges faced, key recurring failures evident across multiple areas of the R&D ecosystem, include: Empty pipelines or stalled research into products intended to address major infectious disease threats, particularly for diseases that mainly affect low-resource settings. Where products are developed, barriers during clinical development and registration mean they are slow to be - or in some locations never - approved for use. Products are approved for use, but limitations in supply chains mean they are not made available to affected communities due to limited supply or logistical issues . Even when products are available, limited consideration for access throughout development means they are not sufficiently appropriate, affordable, or accessible for all communities who need them. These issues manifest in different ways depending on the specific disease and thus also affect different countries and communities in different ways. Usually, the most negatively affected communities are in the lowest-income countries and those in historically marginalised groups, further exacerbating inequalities. The infectious disease R&D ecosystem therefore urgently needs reform . We believe the choices the global community make now will be pivotal to having a better system in decades to come and lead to much better outcomes for people affected by infectious disease, regardless of location or economic status. While scientific discovery represents the foundation of successful R&D, this alone will not solve the problems we collectively face. Transformation is also needed across the wider ecosystem, covering the underpinning systems and policies that guide, finance and regulate research into detecting, preventing and treating infectious disease, and how resulting innovations reach people and communities. We believe that now is the right time to push for ambitious change , given that: Progress against infectious disease targets is slowing while risk factors grow . Despite efforts, infectious disease still causes around a quarter of deaths globally.12 At the same time, repeated experiences - including Covid-19 but also in recent years with MERS, Ebola, and Mpox - show that the risk posed by emerging pathogens is growing. We know that climate change only adds to this risk, as do aspects of our modern world including international travel and complex global food chains. There is an opportunity to learn from existing scientific and policy progress . Major advances have been made over the last 20 years in infectious disease research and response, in part due to the establishment of major global health initiatives (GHIs) and sustained funding from international donors. For some diseases this has led to huge progress, demonstrating what is possible and the mechanisms for change. However, not enough progress has been made in all areas, and lessons can also be learnt from instances where gaps have endured. ContextTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 6 The international community is currently reflecting on the future of global health initiatives (GHIs) . Over the last two decades, GHIs such as Gavi, the Global Fund and others have contributed to enormous results in saving lives and protecting the health of people globally. However, macro shifts in the global health landscape as well as the global political and financial picture have prompted discussion about how these organisations can best support the response to global health challenges. Wellcome is currently supporting a multi-stakeholder process13 to consider this. Covid-19 highlighted major weaknesses that need to be addressed, particularly around equitable access . Learning that can be taken from the pandemic spans every part of the 'value chain' from early-stage research to patient access. Major achievements across product development and partnerships should certainly be celebrated and built upon, showing what can be achieved with significant funding and political will. However, the response highlighted major weaknesses within the current system that need rectifying, particularly those that led to devastating inequalities in access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Pandemic preparedness and response should not be the only focus of policy attention . As the global health community continues to reflect on the global instruments and architecture required to better prepare for future pandemics, consideration should also be given to the much needed support for structures and platforms that enable innovation and preparedness for any infectious disease threat. To efficiently address the full range of pressing infectious disease issues, efforts to strengthen the R&D ecosystem must be functional in all scenarios, covering endemic, epidemic and pandemic threats, as well as issues like emerging infections and drug resistance.What do we mean by the 'R&D ecosystem'? The process of developing new drugs, vaccines or diagnostics for the people and communities who need them is far from simple. When thinking about how to improve this process, we believe that instead of thinking of it as straightforward or linear, it is more helpful to think of an interdependent set of processes, institutions and people that take innovations from early research to use in health systems. This goes beyond the traditional product development 'pipeline' from discovery research to licensure. It also includes enabling policy and regulatory environments, how research efforts are prioritised and coordinated, the infrastructure and processes in place to test and manufacture products, and the role that intellectual property and market forces play to drive innovation and affect equitable access. The concept of an 'ecosystem' reflects the way different parts of this value chain are deeply interconnected. While improvements in certain areas can lead to positive change elsewhere, problems are rarely isolated. For example, decisions on investments into research made by an actor in one part of the world can have long-term implications for scientific progress in a whole field, affecting the disease response globally. The definition of the 'R&D ecosystem' that we are choosing to use for this paper therefore includes: Early-stage setting of research priorities and allocation of resources to different diseases and products. R&D itself, including discovery research and clinical trials. Regulation and licensure of products for use in different jurisdictions. Manufacturing to create an available and sustainable supply. So-called 'downstream' processes including pricing, procurement, access agreements and other processes that help to broker access such as market shaping. We are intentionally taking a broad view of infectious disease as a field to focus on systemic challenges rather than those particular to specific products or disease areas. As such, this paper goes beyond areas in which Wellcome has been (or will be) active as a research funder. The paper will, though, particularly consider: The medical tools we need to counter infectious disease threats . Wellcome's strategic focus is specifically on 'escalating' infectious disease, that is, disease that is changing and with the potential to spread out of control. However, this project is not specific to any particular disease as we believe there is scope to consider strategies and policy solutions that may work for many diseases. Development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics as key products for an effective response in most infectious disease areas. These categories are considered in the broadest sense, from more established products with a range of generic options, to newer or more complex innovations like mRNA vaccines or monoclonal antibodies. We acknowledge that other innovative products are important when it comes to tackling infectious disease - for example, medical devices or vector control technology - but these products are not as ubiquitous across disease threats, and they come with specific development needs. However, we expect that these wider interventions will also benefit from reform across the R&D ecosystem. ContextTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 7 The need to respond to various threats across endemic, epidemic and pandemic disease, as well as emerging disease, resistant infections and climate sensitive diseases . We note the ongoing development of a pandemic instrument, and potentially of a medical countermeasures platform to follow on from the Covid-19 ACT-Accelerator initiative. Our focus for this project is infectious disease beyond pandemics, seeking policy solutions that benefit broader disease control as well as pandemics. We are not addressing challenges around last-mile delivery and implementation by health systems in this paper. This is in recognition of the fact that these issues are far more dependent on the specific characteristics of health systems at a country level than on the more inherently global R&D ecosystem described above, while also sitting outside of Wellcome's specific profile and expertise. However, the development of the R&D ecosystem should go hand in hand with stepwise strengthening of health systems around the world to enable the changes described. We also anticipate that tackling fundamental issues earlier in the product development process - like designing interventions appropriate to setting - will have benefits when it comes to supporting products to reach the people who need them. A 'vision' for an improved infectious disease R&D ecosystem To achieve the fundamental change required, there is a need for a guiding vision that defines an improved future state for the R&D ecosystem, and the levers that policy makers (and others) can use to reach it . This is why Wellcome is now embarking on this project to set out our version of this vision and identify our role in achieving it. This paper is the first step of this project, setting out our initial thoughts on a 20-year vision for an improved R&D ecosystem for infectious disease. Wellcome's guiding principle in this is that in the next two decades, we want to see progress towards an infectious disease R&D ecosystem that efficiently and sustainably develops and brings to market the range of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments required to address the growing threat posed by infections. At its heart, this ecosystem should be structured to provide appropriate products to the people that need them, wherever they live in the world, at an affordable price and in a timely way. To directly address ecosystem failures and accelerate progress towards our vision, we suggest four major areas for change. These are: 1. Equitable and comprehensive priority setting in R&D , driving more balanced allocation of resources into research across different products and disease areas. 2. Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approaches , building capacity and speeding up the time taken for products to be approved for use. 3. Strategic scale-up of geographically diverse and sustainable manufacturing capacity , supporting product supply approaches that align to global need. 4. Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovation , embedding these principles throughout product development to achieve better health outcomes. These change areas have been selected as we believe they represent areas of the ecosystem where concentrated and collective effort could support major steps towards addressing systemic failures. In all these areas, efforts to improve are already underway, but we suggest that greater focus, coordination and support could help create positive change at an even faster pace. ContextTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 8Wellcome's approach This discussion paper is the first stage of a three- part process for Wellcome to articulate an initial guiding vision for ambitious reform to the R&D ecosystem. It provides the first iteration of our 20-year vision, setting out broadly what we think is needed across the R&D ecosystem and ideas for how change could be realised. It is a starting point, and not intended to provide definitive views or answers. It is also intentionally not limited to areas in which Wellcome is or always will be active, aiming to take a broad view of the ecosystem as a whole. The discussion paper will provide the basis for a comprehensive listening exercise held during June, July and August 2023 . This will actively engage stakeholders from across sectors, disciplines and countries, asking for feedback on how we have articulated our vision for the R&D ecosystem, how effectively it describes the key challenges faced, and what the priority areas for action should be. This listening process will involve a series of global meetings as well as opportunities for written feedback - further details on how to engage with the listening exercise can be found on Wellcome's website . As the final step in this initial process, by the end of 2023 we will publish a final paper, setting out our vision for the infectious disease R&D ecosystem and how Wellcome will play a role in driving long-term policy change . This vision will draw on the breadth and depth of perspectives we have heard, as well as reflecting the progress of Wellcome's wider infectious disease strategy. Crucially, we know that we will not be able to deliver the scale of change required by ourselves; therefore, this paper will set out how Wellcome will prioritise its efforts to drive policy change in selected areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact, as well as explaining how we think others can play a role in delivering the wider transformation required to the R&D ecosystem. How to read this paper The chapters of this paper explore in greater detail each of the change areas identified as key for accelerating progress towards our vision for the infectious disease R&D ecosystem. These chapters can be read individually, and we encourage readers to focus on those that align best to personal interests and expertise. Similarly, participation in the listening exercise can be focused on certain themes. Through this paper we welcome readers to consider the following overarching questions, as well as theme-specific questions embedded at the end of each chapter. We hope you will consider taking the opportunity to provide your perspectives through the various channels of the listening exercise.Questions to consider: 1. Do you agree with our overall vision for a more efficient and sustainable R&D ecosystem that serves the needs of all? 2. Have we appropriately characterised the major challenges within the R&D ecosystem? 3. Do the four change areas we have outlined capture the priority areas needing to be addressed in order meet the ambition of our vision? 4. Are there other solutions that might help us achieve the change we want to see, either in theory or already being implemented? 5. Are there any problems, solutions or perspectives related to the R&D ecosystem that we have missed?

Tuberculosis is preventable, treatable and curable. And yet, this disease claimed 1.6 million lives last year [2017] including 300,000 people who lived with HIV. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a public health crisis. This, my friends, is unacceptable.\" H.E. Mrs. Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s, President of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly, UN High-Level Meeting on TB 2018.14 The unacceptable situation described in 2018 has a much longer history. 30 years ago (1993), WHO declared TB a public health emergency. Since then, around 60 million people are estimated to have died from the disease.15 The need for better options to prevent, diagnose and treat this disease has been painfully clear. For decades, people faced long, toxic treatment regimens, diagnosis rates have been persistently low, and prevention options limited. Of the 10.6 million people estimated to have developed active TB in 2021, only around 60 percent were appropriately diagnosed and notified, and 1.6 million people died. Of the 450,000 people who developed multi-drug resistant TB, only 1 in 3 were diagnosed and enrolled on appropriate TB treatment.16 Samples are processed at an Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) facility in Durban, South Africa Image credit: Patrick Shepherd/ Wellcome Trust Case study 1: Tuberculosis Towards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 10The pace of TB innovation has not matched this need. While scientific and epidemiologic challenges have contributed to the slow pace of TB innovation, insufficient political interest and financial investment have also been factors. For example, despite TB R&D funding reaching an all-time high in 2021, these commitments only brought investment halfway to the target of $2 billion USD per year. Private sector financing has been persistently low because TB primarily impacts low- and middle-income countries meaning products are not anticipated to secure sufficient return on investment. This means industry sources only make up about 10 percent of overall TB R&D investment.17 Vaccine development has particularly suffered, with no new options developed in over a century. While governments spent an estimated $90 billion USD on Covid-19 vaccine R&D in the first 11 months of the pandemic, this is more than 80 times the $1.1 billion USD spent on TB vaccine research in the last 11 years. Across all sources of TB R&D funding, vaccines receive much less than other interventions - of every dollar spent on TB research in 2021, only 12 cents went to vaccines.18 Despite this, over time there have been breakthroughs in innovation. Decades of investment led to progress in treatment options, with the approval of new drugs and regimens as well as novel candidates in the pipeline. This has delivered shorter, more effective, and less toxic treatments that are now approved and WHO-recommended.19 However, even as newer products have been approved, these have not been equitably accessible to affected communities, allowing the huge impacts of TB to continue. Barriers to access include monopolies on production, restrictive licensing terms and high prices outside of specific access arrangements. For example: Treatments: After almost 50 years of limited innovation, the last decade has seen several new or repurposed drugs tested in new treatment regimens and approved for use. Bedaquiline, for example, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 as a key drug in safer, shorter and more effective regimens to treat people with drug-resistant TB.20 However, access in many of the most deeply affected countries has been limited by price21 and patent barriers.22 Diagnostics: Access to drug susceptibility testing is essential for ensuring that people with drug-resistant TB access appropriate treatment regimens. However, the most widely available rapid molecular test to detect resistance to first line drug rifampicin is prohibitively expensive, and its price has remained constant for over a decade.23 The history of TB product development shows that innovation is only one piece of the puzzle - for timely and equitable access, improvements must be made across the whole ecosystem. Holistically addressing the scientific, political and financial hurdles that hold back TB R&D and limit access could act as a pathfinder for ecosystem-wide R&D reform for infectious disease more broadly.While governments spent an estimated $90 billion USD on Covid-19 vaccine R&D in the first 11 months of the pandemic, this is more than 80 times the $1.1 billion USD spent on TB vaccine research in the last 11 years.

By 2043, stakeholders across the R&D ecosystem recognise the importance of aligning product development priorities with global need, leading to healthy pipelines to deliver diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines across disease threats. Priorities for innovation are set in an inclusive and coordinated way, leading to balanced and equitable allocation of resources to different diseases and products, as well as growth of centres of R&D innovation closer to affected communities. This should include: Use of diverse perspectives to set priorities, giving greater power to the communities most affected Priority setting processes are inclusive and equitable, enabling the most affected communities to take a central role in setting R&D agendas. Infectious disease innovation is driven by a balanced set of countries and organisations, particularly those facing the highest burden of infectious disease.Good coordination between stakeholders and across stages of the pipeline when setting priorities Coordinating mechanisms form a central pillar of how donors set priorities to improve balance and avoid duplication. Coordinating mechanisms are robust but simple, creating clarity and cohesiveness for all stakeholders and sectors. Investments in innovation that are strategic and evidence-based, balancing global need and profit-making potential Stronger data on burden and product demand in low-resource settings supports private and public sector stakeholders to better understand the needs of less mature markets. The private sector shifts towards priority setting that centres global need within profit-driven pharmaceutical business models. Where are we now? As it stands, the R&D ecosystem does not set priority areas of focus and allocate funds in a way that supports a rich and balanced R&D environment. This has resulted in empty pipelines or stalled research into products intended to address major infectious disease threats, particularly for diseases that mainly affect low-resource settings. Market dynamics alone do not provide sufficient incentives across infectious disease R&D Global pharmaceutical R&D is critically dependent on the private sector. The biopharmaceutical industry holds a huge amount of capacity and capability in all stages of the development pipeline for all product types, particularly during late-stage development, manufacturing and product introduction. However, infectious disease is characterised by unprofitable and poorly functioning markets (Box 1), driving commercially-led R&D efforts towards more profitable areas of innovation, such as oncology and other areas of non- communicable disease. Change area 1 - Equitable and comprehensive priority setting in R&DTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 13Solutions to rebalance failing markets have not gone far enough The global health community has in many instances come together to find innovative mechanisms to address these failing markets by using donor funds to subsidise or directly support private sector-led R&D, or by establishing product development partnerships (PDPs) and non-commercial models for research. However, these mechanisms are imperfect and fragmented in their coverage, and often reliant on incomplete or biased data sources or don't engage optimally with the private sector. Moreover, their priorities and resources are often set by only the most influential global stakeholders: those with political and financial power, often from the Global North.24,25 While this approach has delivered success in some areas of infectious disease, donors' priority setting mechanisms come with their own political and strategic agendas, and do not always take into account wider perspectives - particularly those of the most affected communities. As a result, funding allocations can bring disproportionate focus on certain issues while simultaneously leaving many critical areas of need underserved or entirely overlooked. Donors can also lack the long-term thinking and commitment needed to see products all the way through development and distribution, leaving products continually fighting for support as they progress through the R&D ecosystem.Box 1: Why is the infectious disease market broken? Given the significant costs of infectious disease innovation as with most innovation, private sector innovators must secure steady returns on investment if they are to stay commercially viable. However, the epidemiology of infectious disease threats fundamentally distorts the market for products. The dynamics of disease spread results in peaks and troughs in burden, as well as hot spots for diseases in certain regions and countries, leading to a huge degree of uncertainty around how reliable returns might be. Some diseases may have different expected returns on investment; low expected returns combined with the high opportunity cost of doing any R&D can act as a double disincentive. There are further issues related to the growth of antimicrobial resistance. Even though bacterial infections present a huge burden globally and resistance to existing antibiotics continues to rise,26 recent years have seen some high-profile cases of antibiotic developers failing despite having viable products on the market. As a result, major private sector players have sold off their antibiotic R&D portfolios, leaving deficiencies in the pipeline and the global community exposed to once highly treatable bacterial infections. At the same time, some of the most significant infectious disease threats predominantly affect low- and middle-income countries. Here, underpowered disease surveillance can make the extent of disease burden and thus demand for products unclear. This, teamed with the assumption that these countries are less likely to pay the prices or buy in the volumes that would assure developers of adequate returns, means developers are less willing to invest in products targeted for these countries. For example, over three-quarters of the world's populations now live in countries reporting endemic spread of Chikungunya,27 but this neglected tropical disease (NTD) is concentrated in low-income countries and so products addressing it receive limited focus from private sector players. As it stands, there are no effective vaccines or treatments available. The resulting imbalance is clear. In 2017, pharmaceutical companies spent around $156.7 billion USD on health R&D, but only 3.5 percent of that was focused on development of vaccines and treatments for the Global South, and just 0.3 percent on neglected diseases.28 While multiple GHIs have been established over time to plug the gap left by the private sector in the R&D ecosystem, these are fragmented and incomplete in their coverage and inconsistencies remain. Change area 1 - Equitable and comprehensive priority setting in R&DTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 14What is the change we want to see? Diverse perspectives are used to set priorities, giving greater power to the communities most affected To help align product development priorities with global need, priority setting processes for infectious disease R&D should be inclusive and equitable . That means drawing on greater expertise from the most affected regions, countries and communities, particularly in the Global South. This engagement should not be merely extractive, instead building partnerships that share power and lead to mutual benefit. While the principle of bringing in a more diverse and representative range of expertise in decision-making is relevant to all sectors, it should especially be embedded by public sector and philanthropic funders. These stakeholders have a clearer mandate to focus on global good, forgo profit and absorb risk. At the same time, infectious disease innovation should be driven by a more balanced set of countries and organisations, particularly those facing the highest burden of infectious disease . Having major centres of innovation closer to affected communities will help bring their perspectives more centrally into R&D priorities, shifting global power dynamics. This will enable more research that is rooted in the places affected and their health systems, which will also strengthen the research itself. Many governments and organisations based in countries deeply affected by infectious disease are already focused on developing their capacity and capability for product innovation, making investments to develop the necessary infrastructure and researcher base. However, other donors and grant-makers also need to prioritise allocation of funds to these centres, accelerating change and creating space for less established countries to grow their presence and develop leadership capabilities for infectious disease R&D in a way that helps to rectify the current imbalance. Good coordination between stakeholders and across stages of the pipeline when setting priorities To help donors collectively support a well-balanced pipeline across the many threats and products, coordinating mechanisms should form a central pillar of how donors set priorities . These mechanisms should provide a clear view of existing R&D pipelines as well as outstanding gaps, allowing funders to make informed decisions that take into consideration global need and shared priorities, as well as their own strategic interests. These mechanisms should bring together stakeholders within and across sectors, creating space for donors to share priorities and plans, have honest conversations about where they can act, and explore opportunities to work together to move products efficiently though the pipeline. While mechanisms to advise and coordinate R&D priorities do already exist, there are many different initiatives covering discrete issues and sectors, creating a complex environment for donors to navigate. It will be crucial to ensure coordinating mechanisms are robust but simple, and where possible consolidated , creating clarity and cohesiveness rather than pitting issues or stakeholder groups against each other. Existing initiatives should be strengthened, ensuring they are adequately resourced; have a clear mandate to convene and advise; and donors are committed to actively engaging in processes. Initiatives can still focus on specific threats or product types, but must keep sight of the wider ecosystem in which they operate to support a balanced approach across global infectious disease threats. Investments in innovation are strategic and evidence-based, balancing global need and profit-making potential To enable better decision-making, additional support should be given to generating stronger data on disease burden and product demand, using a variety of approaches and focused particularly in low-resource settings . This information will be critical to truly understand the need for different products and ensure the R&D ecosystem is achieving the desired balance across major threats. This sort of data might also support stronger engagement from the private sector in development of products for lower-resource settings, demonstrating a viable market for innovations that had not been fully appreciated previously. Greater engagement from the private sector could also be driven by strategic shifts towards priority setting that more strongly considers global need within profit-driven pharmaceutical business models . For example, some companies are already setting strategies, forming partnerships, or founding spin off organisations that focus on developing products for societal good without expecting extensive returns. We will return to the question of how such behaviour is incentivised later in this document (change area 4). Change area 1 - Equitable and comprehensive priority setting in R&DTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 15What are potential mechanisms for change? Strengthening equitable participation from communities most affected by disease Encourage major funders to commit to embedding equity in their priority setting processes. Develop and introduce innovative models for participatory priority setting in the processes of major donors from both public and private sectors, focused on shifting the locus and nature of discussion and decision-making to favour leadership by most-affected communities. Recruit experts from countries most affected by disease into leadership and advisory roles in major donor organisations. Evaluate existing GHIs and product development partnerships to ensure these are suitably governed, funded and empowered to effectively prioritise and support needed products in moving through the R&D pipeline. Leadership of R&D innovation from within the Global South Amplify and further build the capacity and capability of research centres and research experts in the countries and communities most affected by infectious disease. Funders commit to rebalance where and who they fund, looking to support sustainable capability increases in lower-resource settings. Developers commit to basing research in and partnering with research centres in countries and communities most affected by infectious disease. Use deliberative engagement with affected communities to unpack tensions and identify barriers in research practice and participation.Improving the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms Strengthen communication channels and/or convening spaces to give major funders of infectious disease R&D better oversight of global investment and encourage funders to coordinate coverage across different products and disease areas. Consider how existing spaces such as the G7, G20 and World Health Assembly could be used to support coordination, or whether new spaces are needed, especially those that more strongly centre voices from the Global South and affected communities. Develop cross-sector product partnerships, supporting stakeholders to commit at the earliest stages to working together to move specific products through different stages of the pipeline. Provide comprehensive and transparent reporting on infectious disease R&D, and independent analysis into the gaps and the risks they present to the world. Strengthen data on disease burden and product demand Support to bolster surveillance systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and ensure data is increasingly accessible and used to inform R&D priorities. Explore underserved markets more deeply to identify untapped opportunities that could lead to commercial benefit. Accountability mechanisms for the private sector Monitoring of practices around social value generation within companies that is openly shared. Investor action driven by stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements.Key questions to address 1. Can the vision outlined above be achieved by building on existing mechanisms that already exist for coordinating R&D priorities, or are additional mechanisms needed? 2. How should data be used to guide R&D priority setting, and where is there a need to enhance data breadth, quality and sharing to support an evidence-based approach? 3. How can coordination mechanisms (either existing or new ones) be structured to provide effective and comprehensive priority setting for infectious disease R&D funding, ensuring meaningful representation and input from communities most affected? How would this be funded and governed, and how would buy-in from different sectors be achieved? 4. Are there lessons that can be learnt from existing models of R&D priority setting and coordination to support the design of future mechanisms? 5. Would more inclusive and equitable priority setting processes look different across different economic and geographic contexts (global, high-income, low- and middle-income, public, private)? 6. As the economies of middle-income countries with high infectious disease burdens continue to grow over the next two decades, how can their role as increasingly influential political actors and national R&D funders evolve to address these global imbalances?

However, these stages are not always well connected, presenting bottlenecks where transition into subsequent stages is not well managed - particularly in cases where ownership must transition between different actors. Whole- system approaches can increase efficiency of R&D processes, considering the product journey from end to end and planning early for the best way to advance product development. Two initiatives embedding whole-system approaches are the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the 100 Days Mission (100DM). Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) Launched in 2017 after the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, CEPI is a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations working to improve the preparedness and response ecosystem, accelerate the development of vaccines and biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats, and enable equitable access to these vaccines and biological countermeasures to all people in need. Equitable access to CEPI-supported countermeasures is core to CEPI's mission. CEPI takes an end-to-end approach to R&D and equitable access, operating as both a funder and a facilitator. It focuses on vaccine and biological countermeasure development, licensure, and manufacturing, while also supporting the efforts of partners in vaccine discovery and delivery to ensure streamlined processing of vaccine candidates. In their first strategic period (2017-2021), CEPI particularly focused on five priority pathogens: initially Lassa, MERS and Nipah, followed by Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya. These were selected in line with WHO's R&D Blueprint, and to address diseases facing major pipeline deficiencies.

The portfolio includes (as of September 2022): the first ever Phase 3 trial of Chikungunya vaccine. the first ever MERS-CoV vaccine into Phase 2 clinical trials. the first ever Nipah virus vaccines into Phase 1 clinical trials. the most advanced Lassa Fever investments, progressed to Phase 1 clinical trials. two of the most advanced non-veterinary vaccine candidates for Rift Valley Fever, including one in Phase 1 clinical trials. Success has not just been achieved through streamlining of processes but also through strategic investments into supporting work that facilitates product development. For example, CEPI is funding the largest epidemiological study of Lassa to date, involving 23,000 participants across Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone over a two-year period. In turn, these studies will help vaccine developers devise an implementation and administration strategy for late-stage clinical trials. CEPI has also made strategic investments into vaccine development of unknown pathogens, funding 5 rapid response platforms for Disease X, a placeholder name which represents the possibility of an unknown pathogen causing a future international epidemic - of which Covid-19 was the first since CEPI was launched. The success of this approach is clear. Thanks in part to existing contractual agreements, CEPI was able to quickly switch its focus to Covid-19, entering into four agreements to develop vaccines for the virus within a few weeks of the SARS CoV-2 genetic sequence being shared. CEPI made initial investments in the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccine and in Novavax, before Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic. Three of the 14 vaccines in CEPI's eventual portfolio have received WHO Emergency Use Listing (Moderna, AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, Novavax) and a further four have been approved for domestic use (Biological E, Clover, SK bioscience, University of Hong Kong). The 100 Days Mission Despite the relative success of CEPI's model during the Covid-19 response, greater efficiencies could still be made to change the course of a pandemic, particularly in the earliest stages. By the time a vaccine had been developed and approved in response to Covid-19, albeit in a record 326 days, an estimated 68.7 million cases had been reported worldwide. Had such a vaccine been made available within 100 days, when there were around 2.3 million cases, countless lives and livelihoods could have been saved. The 100 Days Mission initiative was developed to prepare global systems as much as possible so that within the first 100 days of a pandemic threat being identified, there is availability of safe, effective and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines (DTVs). Coordinated by the International Pandemic Preparedness Secretariat (IPPS), the programme takes a whole-ecosystem approach to achieving the 100DM, collaborating with implementation partners to make progress against three high-level goals: 1. Investing in research and development to fill the gaps in our DTV arsenal - including understanding the current DTV pipeline against priority pathogens and identifying where the gaps lie, encouraging the preparation of prototype DTV libraries against pathogens with the greatest pandemic potential, and developing innovative approaches to being ready for Disease X. 2. Embedding best practice and preparation in business-as-usual activity - including improved global pathogen surveillance techniques, greater use of networked randomised control trial platforms, more efficient regulatory processes, and establishment of geographically diversified, flexible and sustainable manufacturing capacity. 3. Agreeing different rules of the road in a pandemic - to avoid time being wasted in negotiating the basics at the start of an outbreak. This includes the need for a more nuanced and rapid pandemic declaration process, pre-agreed surge financing mechanisms to enable scale-up and procurement of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, as well as guidance on supply chains, indemnification, data sharing, and biological sample sharing. The scale of ambition of the 100DM necessitates a whole ecosystem approach. The IPPS and its partners are working towards this by facilitating end-to-end coalitions between researchers, research funders, regulators and manufacturers. This helps different actors understand each other's needs whilst also enabling smoother transitions and saving time between different stages of DTV development. This approach crucially allows for greater understanding between partners of how access principles can be built on from the early stages of research - such as co-designing target product profiles with affected communities or considering needle free delivery methods and thermostability to enable simplicity of manufacturing and delivery.

By 2043 the R&D ecosystem will support efficient and smooth development of products, helping them become available to affected communities in the swiftest time while maintaining quality and safety. This is enabled by mature clinical and regulatory capacity in all regions of the world, along with streamlined and harmonised clinical trial processes and regulatory pathways. This should include: Development of strong and streamlined clinical trial infrastructure globally Investment made to support the development of clinical trial infrastructure, tools and personnel in regions with a high disease burden. Trial processes are streamlined, with a focus on clinical trial networks and innovative methods. Development of streamlined regulatory processes, underpinned by mature national and regional bodies Financing is available to support the development of national regulatory agencies towards higher levels of maturity. Regional and international mechanisms emerge to support greater regulatory harmonisation between countries where appropriate.Coordination between stakeholders to create shared standards and support the running of processes from end-to-end Open channels of communication between regulators, policy makers, product developers and clinicians throughout clinical trial and regulatory phases. Support for regulatory science to develop appropriate tools, standards, and approaches to assess products. Where are we now? Differences in the capacity, capability and effectiveness of clinical trials and regulatory processes across the world have led to major discrepancies in access to medicines in different countries and regions. Limited clinical trial infrastructure close to affected communities leads to inequity Clinical trials mark critical stages of product development needed to prove the safety and utility of products for different populations, and to filter out products that are not fit for purpose. But these processes are often complex, time-consuming, and costly, requiring significant infrastructure (physical and digital) and trained personnel if very specific evidence standards are to be met.As it stands, the most mature clinical infrastructure is concentrated in high-income regions, such as the US and Europe. More limited capacity in lower-resource settings increases costs and risks, deterring product developers from running studies in those locations. For example, research examining over 13,000 infectious disease trials between 2007 and 2017 shows 37.8 percent took place in North America and only 9.7 percent in Africa.29 This imbalance has a negative impact on equity, limiting what we know about the efficacy and appropriateness of products for communities in low-resource settings, especially when considering that the highest burden of infectious disease occurs in lower-income parts of the world - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.30 Many of these challenges are not unique to infectious disease R&D. However, the consequences are more limited in areas of biomedical R&D - such as non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - where the regions with the most established clinical trial infrastructure are also those with high burdens of disease. Additional complexities are also presented in infectious disease trials due to complex epidemiology (Box 2). Change area 2 - Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approachesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 20Uneven maturity of regulatory agencies around the world impacts access to products Regulatory approval is a major milestone in R&D processes, acting as a gateway for developers to market and supply products, for policy makers to incorporate products into clinical guidelines, and for healthcare practitioners to begin using products to benefit patients. However, 74 percent of countries have suboptimal regulatory systems31 and securing financing to build capacity remains a challenge.32 As a result, delays to registration of products in different countries remains a major barrier to accessing new innovations. For example, a 2012 study estimated that the overall time taken for the registration of new medical products is typically six to twelve months in high-income settings compared to four to seven years in sub-Saharan Africa33. The complexity of regulatory approval applications is further compounded by the fact that countries often have quite different requirements, creating a duplicative process. While some reliance mechanisms are in place, these are fragmented and leave notable gaps.34 As a result, many developers stagger their applications to different national regulators, usually starting with the most known and profitable markets, and leaving some countries - usually those with fewer resources - waiting even longer for products to be made available. In some cases, additional costs associated with trials and registration cause developers to avoid registering products in certain jurisdictions at all.Box 2: Running clinical trials for infectious diseases The dynamic nature of infectious disease epidemiology presents specific challenges to running clinical trials for infectious disease products. To sufficiently test product efficacy, trials need to recruit enough patients to reach adequate statistical power and, if testing preventative measures, be based in locations with active disease transmission. However, it is not always easy to forecast disease spread, and approaches to trials must be adapted according to epidemiology. In the case of endemic diseases like TB, stable disease incidence means trials can relatively reliably reach sufficient cases to meet evidence thresholds, though this can take several years. Infections that have seasonal outbreaks like influenza or Lassa Fever, or infections that recur in hotspots like cholera are also relatively predictable in terms of where and when they will arise, but provide only short windows for testing that trialists must be ready to exploit. However, predictability decreases where surveillance infrastructure is limited, or where data on crucial factors like transmission routes or reservoirs is missing. Emerging diseases with less predictable dynamics, including sporadic infections like Ebola, are even harder to run trials for.35 The changing nature of where outbreaks crop up and how long they last mean there can be a very limited window at the peak of an epidemic wave to set up and run a trial, with far more limited opportunity for planning ahead.36 This is not compatible with the extended time needed to design, establish, and approve trials, including stages to coordinate and recruit patients which can be highly complex. This is particularly difficult in resource-limited settings where existing clinical and regulatory capacity is often less well established, and a greater degree of trial infrastructure may need to be set up from scratch. Even if a trial is established, the way an outbreak changes over time can deeply affect the clinical evidence it is possible to generate. A drop in cases means fewer patients to recruit from before the trial has secured enough data, and waning transmission can make it hard to prove the efficacy of preventative and diagnostic options. The evolution of pathogens presents further issues. New viral variants or the emergence of resistance can compromise original trial designs or require additional studies to test products against these evolving threats. Change area 2 - Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approachesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 21What is the change we want to see? A strong and streamlined clinical trial infrastructure developed globally, particularly in regions with high infectious disease burden To end the reliance on running trials in locations with the most historical investment and most developed infrastructure, sustained effort is needed to increase capacity and capability for clinical trials in previously underserved areas, particularly where burden of infectious disease is highest. This needs to include investment across infrastructure, tools and personnel, and must be done in a way that embeds best practice. Product developers must commit to making use of these resources, further bolstering their maturity. This could lead to huge gains in equity and access by increasing the number and scale of trials focused on and based in the most affected communities, generating data with a more diverse range of populations, and providing the evidence needed to register new products in these locations. Streamlining trial processes will also lead to major efficiencies and improve responsiveness, particularly the greater use of clinical trial networks (Box 3). There is much to learn from the expansion of existing networks that have successfully developed a diverse site base and simplified trial development and approval through consistent trial designs, protocols and contracts. Not only have these initiatives enhanced the data coming through current trials, but they have also strengthened clinical capacity in different locations in a sustainable way. Other initiatives such as the Good Clinical Trials Collaborative (GCTC) have been established to develop and promote guidance making it easier to conduct ethical and robust randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Of course, one size does not fit all, and more work is needed to establish diverse and flexible networks across regions and disease areas.Box 3: Clinical trial networks Clinical trial networks bring together clinicians, researchers and their associated hospitals and institutions to share infrastructure and resources.37 Rather than needing to set up trial infrastructure from scratch at the initiation of every clinical trial, these networks establish a pool of existing sites that can rapidly be mobilised into new studies, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Alignment between members on systems for data sharing and streamlining of clinical trial protocols allows for smooth collaboration. This better enables complex multi-centre clinical trials that provide even richer data on product efficacy in different populations, particularly where networks span countries and include sites with access to previously hard to reach populations. Alignment can also support the use of innovative trial designs that deliver results more efficiently. These networks also support capability building in new or lower-resourced centres, with more established researchers providing support to newer members of the network. Clinical trial networks are often operated on a regional basis, avoiding complexities surrounding differing regulatory standards and data sharing practices between regions. For example, the European Clinical Research Alliance for Infectious Diseases (ECRAID) is a pan-European clinical research network focused on infectious disease, including over 1200 hospitals sites, over 900 clinical laboratories, and over 250 primary care sites. Other networks take a specific disease focus, encouraging collaboration and efficient use of resources across researchers working in that area. For example, ADVANcing Clinical Evidence in Infectious Diseases38 (ADVANCE-ID) is a network of more than 35 hospitals across Asia collaborating on clinical research to explore optimal prescribing of antibiotics to patients with resistant infections. The remit of this network is anticipated to widen beyond antibiotics in the near future where the resources could prove valuable for testing products targeted at wider infectious disease threats. Proliferation of networks without coordination or strategic oversight could lead to duplication of effort and potential gaps. To counter this, initiatives have been developed to support greater cooperation between networks. For example, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) brings together research networks from across the world to support a coordinated and agile research response to outbreaks. Similarly, GLOPID-R brings together funders working on pandemic preparedness and response, including a working group connecting funders to clinical trial networks to streamline activities. Change area 2 - Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approachesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 22Streamlined regulatory processes underpinned by mature national and regional bodies Concentrated commitment and financing to help national regulatory agencies develop higher levels of maturity must be prioritised even more strongly than it has been. This must include support for personnel, digital systems to facilitate effective information flows, and appropriate legal systems. Development should not only focus on moving towards more effective systems for granting approval while maintaining strong quality and safety standards, but also on systems for approving clinical trial protocols, assessing manufacturing sites and for monitoring the ongoing safety and effectiveness of products to ensure product licensing remains appropriate. Regional and international mechanisms that support greater regulatory harmonisation and reliance should be developed to increase efficiency, reduce duplication, and improve access to medical products. While the WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme has provided support here, this mechanism can still be complex for product developers to engage with. New initiatives like the African Medicines Agency represent an exciting opportunity to do things differently, allowing countries in Africa greater control and ownership of how medicines are used. Additional infrastructure to enable networking across agencies will help accelerate change, not only to support greater alignment, but also to enable mature agencies to provide insights that can be used by those that are still developing. Building trust will be integral to this, ensuring any changes towards harmonisation are collectively agreed and suitable for all, and reliance is based on deep understanding of, and confidence in, decisions made by others.Coordination between stakeholders to create shared standards and support the running of processes from end-to-end Connectivity between clinical trial and regulatory infrastructure is also crucial to the smooth functioning of R&D pipelines, supporting coordination over trial standards, evidence thresholds, and approval dossiers. Increasing capacity and capability on both sides will improve alignment and efficiency, but this can be further supported through open channels of communication between regulators, policy makers, product developers and clinicians throughout the clinical trial and regulatory phases . Forums are needed that support transparency in development processes as well as a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of other stakeholders. This could help to identify efficiencies that will speed up clinical trials, regulatory approval, policy adoption and introduction to use, taking an end-to-end approach. Greater support for regulatory science that develops tools, standards and approaches to assess products will also be crucial, and must form the basis from which clinical and regulatory stakeholders align and harmonise their practices. This should support the process of identifying appropriate standards and methods that stakeholders can agree on. However, this should not always require actors to meet the highest possible standard, which for some may be unnecessary as well as unobtainable, and would therefore undermine moves towards greater balance and equity. This type of work should also explore opportunities presented by innovative clinical trial approaches that reduce the complexity, cost and time of trials while increasing the diversity of populations covered. Further evidence is needed to support wider acceptance and implementation of approaches like adaptive trials - such as those used in some settings during the Covid-19 pandemic39 - as well as correlates of protection or human infection studies that could support data gathering outside of outbreaks. What are potential mechanisms for change? Sustained support for developing infrastructure Provide funding to develop the capacity and capability of infrastructure, tools and personnel associated with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies in low-resource settings. Provide in-kind support to share knowledge from more established sites and agencies to those in development. Focus on strengthening infrastructure in anchor countries across regional economic communities, developing local centres of excellence in specific clinical and regulatory activities. Create a strategy for sustainable financing of these developments, including a commitment from funders beyond the pharmaceutical sector to support the development of infrastructure, including from GHIs. Change area 2 - Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approachesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 23Development of trial and regulatory coordination mechanisms Develop forums that promote open discussion between regulators, policy makers, product developers and clinicians to improve understanding between groups and identify opportunities to increase efficiencies. Establish collaborative mechanisms to develop and help introduce innovative approaches in trials and regulation, ensuring processes are aligned across stakeholders and implemented effectively. Reform of regulatory requirements based on evidence Encourage collaboration between regulatory agencies to harmonise processes (where appropriate and where this won't create unnecessary burden), creating greater consistency in what agencies are requiring without lowering standards. Reform legal and policy frameworks, including the legal basis and framework for reliance. Increase requirements on product developers to conduct clinical trials in affected communities. Increase requirements on product developers to register products in a country if they conduct a clinical trial in that location. Support regulatory science that develops appropriate tools, standards, and approaches to assess infectious disease products.Development and scale up of innovative clinical trial methodologies Develop clinical trial networks, leading to connected and coordinated systems of trials and sites that can quickly mobilise to provide access to a larger pool of patients in different countries. Rationalise new and existing clinical trial networks, ensuring investments are strategic, networks address areas of need, and duplication is avoided. Encourage the adoption, scale-up and acceptance by regulators and policy makers of innovative clinical trial approaches that can reduce the complexity, cost and time of trials while increasing the diversity of populations covered - for example, basket trials, umbrella trials and/or adaptive trials. Carry out further research on the potential of correlates of protection and human infection studies, exploring how far these methods can confirm safety and efficacy, and implementation needs in different scenarios.Key questions to address 1.

Please share your feedback Change area 2 - Streamlined clinical trial and regulatory approachesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 24Case study 3: Ebola virus disease (EVD) Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe viral haemorrhagic fever with an average fatality rate of around 50 percent. There are currently two vaccines that are effective for use against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus. The successful regulatory approval of these vaccines is thanks to data collected through clinical trials carried out during the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, which had more cases and deaths than all other outbreaks combined. However, not all Ebola outbreaks are caused by this strain of the virus. Between September 2022 and January 2023, an outbreak of the Sudan Ebola virus took place in Uganda.40 With a case fatality rate of 39 percent, the outbreak resulted in 55 deaths out of a total of 142 confirmed cases, and an estimated additional 22 deaths from probable cases. There are three vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola virus currently in the R&D pipeline ready to be trialled, but complexities facing clinical and regulatory processes are preventing these vaccines from being put into use. For example, clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of these new products, but in line with conventional regulatory and clinical processes, these can only be conducted during an outbreak. However, Ebola outbreaks are not only rare and unpredictable, but when they do occur, it is usually in extremely fragile settings facing multiple infectious disease threats. In contexts like these, additional layers of planning are required to ensure an effective trial can take place, and to coordinate competition on the use of that trial site for testing of a wide range of important potential products. As a result of all these factors, planning and rolling out a major clinical trial for a disease like Ebola has been extremely challenging. In the case of the Uganda outbreak in 2022, efforts had already been made before the outbreak began to design a trial for the local context, working in partnership with local leadership. While this was a step in the right direction, when the outbreak began, the processes to fully agree on protocols and make the decision to go ahead with trials was still too slow. Given there were only 142 confirmed cases in total, it was not possible to test the efficacy of any of the products before the outbreak ended. This demonstrates the urgent need for actions to ensure we are better prepared to run trials during outbreaks. The case of Ebola also highlights the opportunity to explore more innovative clinical and regulatory approaches to progress products through the R&D ecosystem more effectively. For example, Ebola viruses are part of a group of viruses known as Filoviruses. The fact that we already have two approved vaccines for Zaire Ebola virus presents the opportunity for studies focused on correlates of protection, exploring if new vaccines illicit a similar immune response to those already approved for use. This provides an alternative route for authorisation that could be more appropriate than running a full-scale clinical trial. Dr Felicity Hartnell, who is a clinical research fellow at Oxford University, injects the vile of the Ebola vaccine called Chimp Adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3) to Ruth Atkins, who is the first healthy UK volunteer to receive an Ebola vaccine at the Oxford Vaccine Group Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM) on September 17, 2014 in Oxford, EnglandPhoto by Steve Parsons- WPA Pool/Getty Images Case study 3: Ebola virus disease (EVD)Towards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 25Case study 4: Oral Cholera Vaccine Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal illness caused by bacterial infection, spread through contaminated food and water. Currently, there are three oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) approved for use by WHO. Until recently, two of these had been made available through a global stockpile funded by Gavi. The stockpile includes vaccines for reactive campaigns to support outbreak response, which has been the main approach to controlling cholera. The stockpile also includes vaccines to run larger preventative campaigns in endemic areas to prevent outbreaks from happening, though countries have only started using this approach more recently. However, cholera outbreaks are hard to predict and even preventative campaigns have largely been 'one-offs' rather than repeatedly run. This has left manufacturers that make cholera OCVs facing inconsistent demand that is challenging to predict and goes against their preference to forecast on longer timelines. Based on this and concerns about profitability, one key manufacturer of cholera OCVs has recently discontinued their product, reducing critical supply to the global stockpile. This has left just one company producing cholera vaccines for the entire global response. Simultaneously, after years of steady progress in reducing deaths from cholera, in 2022 cholera outbreaks surged across 30 countries.41 These more recent outbreaks have been larger, longer, and more deadly, driven by factors including conflict, population displacement, and humanitarian crises, all of which contribute to inadequate access to safe water. Adding to this, climate change is causing increases in extreme weather events that can trigger outbreaks. The scale of recent outbreaks was unexpected, and attempts to increase manufacturing capacity from alternative sources to bolster the global vaccine stockpile has been unable to keep pace with need. Ultimately, manufacturers have not responded to the call to bolster supplies, reflecting the commercial unattractiveness of OCVs. Even where manufacturers have stepped in to support stockpiling efforts, for new manufacturers the process associated with developing capability and approval to produce vaccines will be far too slow - with one South African manufacturer planning to start production estimating it would take years before the product could be made available. As a result, demand for cholera vaccines is now almost double the available supply. Countries are having to adapt by only administering single doses rather than two doses to control outbreaks,42 despite uncertainty around the effectiveness in some populations. Experts continue to debate the best way to respond to ongoing outbreaks, particularly if the global community is to meet targets to reduce cholera deaths by 90 percent by 2030.43 The response must be underpinned by a more robust and diverse manufacturing base for crucial products, and prevention and control approaches that enable consistent, predictable demand for manufacturers to respond to.

By 2043 the R&D ecosystem should reliably deliver products to people where and when they are needed. Products coming out of the R&D pipeline - especially complex products - should efficiently enter supply chains that are globally distributed with strong manufacturing bases closer to affected communities, and with the tools to flex in line with local, regional and global need. This should include: Expansions to the manufacturing base that are geographically spread in line with global needs Manufacturing capacity is spread globally and developed to be closer to affected communities. A strategic approach is taken, engaging industry, global purchasers, and governments to build capacity to manufacture different products that address regional and global needs. Manufacturing sites that are sustainable, well- coordinated and able to flex according to need Financing for expanded capacity is sustainable, and not reliant on indefinite subsidies. Sites are networked across regions and built on flexible models that balance routine functions with the ability to respond to changes in product demand or wider supply base.Incorporating considerations about affordable, appropriately scaled-up manufacturing into product development at an early stage Manufacturing requirements are planned early in product development to support efficient scale- up of supply and deeper engagement with manufacturing options that could make supply more available and affordable to affected communities. Intellectual property (IP) approaches facilitate use of more diverse manufacturing capacity while allowing innovators to protect their rights. Where are we now? Limitations within manufacturing infrastructure and practices continue to present bottlenecks within the infectious disease R&D ecosystem, meaning products are often not made appropriately available to affected communities due to limited supply or logistical issues. Manufacturing is often considered as a separate issue to R&D, but reforms to this sector should be considered an integral part of changes to the wider R&D ecosystem. A lack of diversity in supply chains increases risk and supply gaps Over many decades, market dynamics have driven the concentration and rationalisation of manufacturing capacity, which has resulted in a lack of geographic diversity and a limited pool of suppliers to produce the products needed around the world. India and China have become global centres for manufacturing of generic products, with favourable business environments and a strong infrastructure base fuelling the rapid growth of the generics industry in both countries. Significant economies of scale, particularly in vaccine manufacturing, strengthen the position of established producers and present barriers to new entrants to the marketplace. Meanwhile, newer manufacturing technologies - like mRNA vaccines or biologics - where processes have so far been harder to replicate, have often stayed concentrated in regions like Europe and the USA. This is partly down to capacity constraints, but also IP practices whereby innovators usually only provide licences to a small number of trusted manufacturers, often leading to limited registration of products, supply chain bottlenecks due to concentrated know-how and high prices for these products. Change area 3 - Strategic scale-up of geographically diverse and sustainable manufacturing capacityTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 28This has resulted in a fragmented system that lacks diversity, creating risks of single points of failure and gaps in global supply. Countries who do not have their own manufacturing capacity and are less able to pay or buy in volumes are often priced out or pushed to the back of the queue for supplies. For products where demand largely comes from lower-resource settings, supplies may be even more scarce where manufacturers move away from making products due to limited returns or changing priorities. Solutions are being discussed but major challenges remain In light of major inequities in supply and access to critical products during the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing the diversity and scale of manufacturing capacity is high on national, regional, and global political agendas, particularly in low-resource settings or regions with limited manufacturing presence. However, there are major challenges to successful scale-up and sustainability which will require clear strategic direction and deep coordination to overcome. Expanding capacity will take significant time and investment. Not least to develop infrastructure and personnel, but also to secure product licences and build relationships with developers over technology transfer, and to support facilities through international regulatory assessment and approval.44 Even if upfront costs are covered, longer-term economic viability still needs to be demonstrated.45 New manufacturers will incur higher cost of goods sold and higher operating costs than established manufacturers, making it hard for their products to be competitive, particularly in more saturated markets. These challenges are particularly acute for products with complex manufacturing needs like biologics, as building appropriate capacity is especially difficult and costs are high. While it is likely manufacturing costs will drop over time as facilities mature, difficult decisions as to how and where to invest in capability building must be made now - and supported in the longer-term - to reap benefits for affordability and access in the future. At the same time, lack of coordination in manufacturing initiatives risks leading to overcapacity or skew towards certain products. While there may be reason to scale up more than is generally needed to build in preparedness for pandemics, facilities must be in constant use - 'always on', rather than used only in an emergency - to maintain quality and adherence to good manufacturing practice (GMP). What is the change we want to see? An expanded manufacturing base that is geographically spread in line with global needs Greater weight should be given to diversity of the manufacturing base, ensuring capacity is spread globally to share benefits and reduce supply risk. New and more spread-out manufacturing hubs could be developed, and others scaled up - particularly in low- and middle-income countries and closer to affected communities - to ensure supply of products meets global needs and countries most affected by infectious disease can have greater control over supply of products. A strategic approach will also be required, balancing local and regional need with competitiveness . A 'one-size-fits-all' approach will not be appropriate. Careful decisions - engaging industry, global purchasers, and governments - must be made about the type of capacity to be developed in different locations, making sure these address need in each location while remaining commercially viable. For example, a focus on emerging platforms or novel products could provide a way to compete with existing players, referred to as the \"platform leapfrog model\".46 The size of facilities should also be considered, as well as whether a focus on end-to-end manufacturing or just certain stages of the manufacturing process would be most viable. Decisions should be based on evidence and data illustrating disease burden and potential markets, including factors like demand forecasts, likely use cases and cost effectiveness. In practical terms, an optimal global uplift in capacity will not mean the same type of manufacturing capacity and capability in every country, so governments will need to look beyond national interests and engage cooperatively on a regional or global basis. A manufacturing base that is sustainable, well- coordinated and can flex according to need Fundamentally, long-term financing for expanding diverse capacity must be assured to make scale- up of manufacturing a success. Upfront costs will be significant and must be covered, but sites cannot be reliant on indefinite subsidies and the long-term goal must be for new manufacturers to be competitive. Different financing models will be appropriate depending on the strategic approach and stage of scale-up . For example, commitment to major investment from a public-private partnership may be needed to support initial costs and development before facilities become commercially viable. Strategies like advance market commitments or pooled regional procurement could help facilities stay commercially viable. There is a role for major purchasers (such as Gavi or UNICEF) to play in supporting the development of manufacturing capacity in new regions, perhaps by committing to time-limited price premiums for new producers. Change area 3 - Strategic scale-up of geographically diverse and sustainable manufacturing capacityTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 29Sustainability will also be supported by building coordination and flexibility into manufacturing models from the start . Networks between manufacturers should allow for information-sharing that helps avoid duplication and enables better decision-making around where to focus effort. This should in turn feed into flexible manufacturing models that are prepared to respond to changes in product demand or the wider supply base. This flexibility should also be an asset in times of global crisis, supporting outbreak, epidemic and pandemic response.47 Considerations about affordable, appropriately scaled-up manufacturing are incorporated into product development at an early stage While manufacturing is often considered as a separate issue to R&D, centring this component more squarely in the R&D ecosystem and at an earlier stage within product development could lead to significant gains when it comes to accessibility of products. By routinely planning manufacturing requirements early across products , scale-up of product supply can be processed far more efficiently, and considerations put in place for how to enable geographically diverse manufacturing options that could make supply more available and affordable to affected communities. Wider options for building access into R&D from the earliest stages are covered in greater depth later in this paper (change area 4). An important piece of the puzzle is IP and technology transfer. The scaling up of more geographically diverse manufacturing capacity - particularly for new innovations - will only be feasible if innovators are prepared to provide licences and enter cooperative relationships with new manufacturers across regions. While the rights of innovators should be protected to ensure return on investment, and manufacturers must be selected with competitiveness as a core requirement, more open approaches to IP governance will be needed for diverse manufacturing capacity to work well. Partnerships between new manufacturers and innovators must be central, working together to develop terms for licensing agreements that support widening access to products while also allowing innovators to protect their rights. For example, this could come from setting terms on the licence such as restricting supply to a specific region. These partnerships should also support technology transfer processes and be the basis of a long-lasting and cooperative relationship. Options for business models that move towards a more open approach to IP , while maintaining incentives to innovate, will be revisited later in this paper (change area 4). What are potential mechanisms for change? Sustainable financing mechanisms to expand manufacturing Make available domestic and international financial mechanisms to subsidise upfront costs, such as grants or tailored and low-cost funding with longer payback periods. Provide economic incentives from governments and other funders to support expansion of capacity under particular terms. Incentives could include subsidies, tax incentives and industrial policies to create a favourable business environment. Purchasers agree to cover a price premium in the shorter term, allowing new suppliers to be competitive alongside more established manufacturers. Set up advance purchase agreements providing commitments from procurers to purchase a certain volume of supply. Use pooled procurement mechanisms, where countries in a region make commitments to purchase products collectively to assure more substantial demand. Prioritise sourcing from manufacturers based closer to populations, by regional governments and other initiatives supplying products (e.g. Gavi). Building evidence to support strategic approaches to manufacturing Generate market intelligence insights and feed into strategic decision-making processes, considering factors such as market size, demand forecasts, likely use cases and cost effectiveness. Use peer support from established manufacturers to help establish strong strategies and the most appropriate and flexible manufacturing models, including options like partnerships and secondments. Regions and individual countries to consider how industrial strategies can be better linked to public health needs. Change area 3 - Strategic scale-up of geographically diverse and sustainable manufacturing capacityTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 30Coordination mechanisms Create coordination mechanisms focused on improving information-sharing between stakeholders, helping manufacturers to make business decisions and donors to identify where to direct their support. Different models will be suited to different actors at different levels (national, regional and global),48 such as: -manufacturer networks focused on sharing market intelligence, collaborating to reduce overlap and building efficient supply chains. -regional hubs, including manufacturers and funders of scale-up initiatives, defining shared strategic priorities and identifying needs and actions as capacity develops. -global mechanisms to track available capacity, with a remit to coordinate and deploy facilities in a crisis.IP and technology transfer governance approaches Build capacity of manufacturers and partners on technology transfer before the manufacturers attract potential private partnerships. Establish deep and sustained partnerships between innovators and manufacturers, speeding up technology transfer and willingness to license over time. Set up licensing agreements that allow new manufacturers to supply products to specific regions or countries, allowing innovators to maintain more profitable markets. Integrate new and diverse manufacturing capacity using access initiatives like the Medicines Patent Pool. Include terms in the Pandemic Treaty that clearly set out requirements for times of global crisis to enable rapid scaling up of manufacturing and fair allocation of products. Link increasing manufacturing capacity with growing R&D centres close to affected communities.Key questions to address 1.

While interventions throughout the R&D ecosystem allowed this accelerated innovation,49 the need for such a rapid response highlighted bottlenecks and deficiencies in the system that were still allowed to pervade, particularly when it came to equitable access to products. A key driver for this was the inadequacy of supply chains, particularly for mRNA vaccines . Using innovative platform technology, mRNA vaccines use a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) that contains the genetic code for cells to produce proteins. These vaccines introduce a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a protein present in the pathogen of interest, stimulating the recipient to produce an immune response. Scale up of production of these breakthrough vaccines was limited by global manufacturing capacity for complex biological products being largely concentrated in Europe and the US, as well as being hugely reliant on relationships between lead developers and a few select contract manufacturers. This limited the total available supply of mRNA vaccines, as opportunities were missed to enable wider technology transfer and sharing of knowledge that could have supported expansion of manufacturing capacity.

By March 2021, countries representing 16 percent of the global population had already secured at least 70 percent of the doses from the five leading vaccine candidates available for that year, and almost 80 percent of the vaccines delivered by that point had been administered in just 10 countries. The access gap was not inevitable. For the first time, countries of all economic backgrounds could have shared the risk of developing vaccines, pooled their demand, and coordinated supply through the new Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Initiative (COVAX). By investing in manufacturing up front and purchasing vaccines at scale, COVAX aimed to provide all countries with access to a diverse range of vaccines at the lowest possible price, with lower-income countries' doses being subsidised. However, COVAX's efforts have been limited and undermined by bilateral vaccine deals, particularly by countries with greater purchasing power or privileged relationships with key developers. Case study 5: Manufacturing of complex biological productsManufacturing and innovation for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may face similar challenges to mRNA vaccines. mAbs - single antibodies expressed from identical immune cells - are a powerful tool in treating and preventing disease. They act specifically against their targets, ranging from viruses and bacteria to cancerous cells. While most mAbs in use today are for non-communicable diseases, there is a growing pipeline for emerging infectious diseases ranging from Covid-19 to rabies, as well as drug-resistant bacteria. mAbs manufacturing is highly technical, involving complex manufacturing operations of biologic raw materials, rigorous procedures to ensure the tolerability and quality of the final product, and intricate supply chain management. As it stands, this kind of manufacturing capability is predominantly located in high-income settings like Europe and the US.51 These factors combined mean that antibody therapies are expensive to develop and manufacture,52 and are largely targeted at markets in the US, Canada and Europe. Given the growing number of non-communicable and infectious diseases for which mAbs are or might be an effective treatment or preventive, there is clearly a global need for these products. As the percentage of mAbs in development pipelines increases, more and more mAbs will enter the market, and the disparity in access between high- income countries and the rest of the globe will likely only worsen.Towards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 33 Access and affordability Change area 4 Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovation Security personnel deliver cool boxes containing vials of Covishield vaccine to administering rooms at a vaccination center set up at Navyug School in New Delhi, India, on Monday 21 June 2021 Photographer: Sumit Dayal/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 34Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovation What is our vision for 2043? By 2043, innovation and affordable access are twin goals of the R&D ecosystem, supported by collaborative action from across public, private and philanthropic sectors. Considerations for how to maximise access to new products in affected communities in low-resource settings are 'baked in' to the design, development and launch of products at an early stage. This should include: Access embedded as an essential component of product development cycles Access plans are routinely developed and embedded in thinking at every stage of product development. A range of pricing strategies are used so that products are made available to communities at an affordable price. Products that are available in high-income countries are routinely also made available in lower-income settings without delays. Products are designed to better meet the needs of affected communities and are suitable for the environments in which they will be used.Public, private and philanthropic stakeholder activities aligned to stimulate innovation and improve equitable access Access mechanisms led by product development partnerships (PDPs) and GHIs are extended to be more consistent in their coverage and better aligned with R&D efforts. Private sector commitments to equitable access are strengthened on a voluntary basis, using tools like independent monitoring of practices and investor pressure. Alternative business models developed that place equal emphasis on innovation and equitable access There is an increasing role for partnerships and innovative business models that focus on accessibility. New approaches are taken to combining public, private and philanthropic funds that ensure value to the public.Where are we now? Each year, millions of people suffer illness or die because, even where innovative products that would help are becoming available, they are not sufficiently appropriate, affordable, or accessible to all communities who need them. In infectious disease, this problem is most acute in certain countries in Africa and South-East Asia, where the burden of disease is greatest, but the ability of healthcare systems to purchase and deliver innovative products is often more limited.53 Access challenges are not routinely addressed in a systematic way As discussed in the first chapter of this paper, the high costs and risks associated with infectious disease R&D present commercial challenges, disincentivising innovators from engaging with disease areas or products that are targeted for use in lower-resource markets. Even where development has been largely or wholly financed by public and philanthropic funders (including through PDPs) and pressure to recoup investment might be reduced, logistical and practical challenges of bringing new products to all parts of the world remain. Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovationTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 35Initiatives developed to address these access gaps have made progress. The mobilisation of funds through GHIs such as the Global Fund and Gavi, as well as growth in PDPs such as DNDi , Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and newer initiatives like Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), have delivered transformational benefits in supporting products to be made available in health systems which could not otherwise purchase them at the scale required, even at low prices. Similarly, voluntary licensing platforms like the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) have enabled faster availability of innovative products through licensing to lower-cost generic manufacturers. However, these initiatives do not provide coverage across all diseases or risks; often remain fundamentally distinct from initiatives to directly support product development itself; and are better positioned to support access to products that already exist rather than encouraging innovation and access in areas of unmet need. As it stands, the infectious disease R&D ecosystem is failing to address access challenges in a systematic way. Planning for equitable access is too often seen as a discretionary part of product development, something to only be considered right before products enter the market, or that threatens to undermine the commercial viability of a product. In infectious disease, where the benefits of new products will ultimately be felt globally but the immediate unmet need is highest in low- and middle-income countries, it is unsustainable - and unacceptable - for product developers to not consider the needs of patients in all settings. Ideological debates are reductive and often do not lead to real change Within the global health community, debates about access understandably become highly charged, given the direct impact on lives in low-income regions. But this creates a tendency to fixate on narrow topics - such as IP protections, or pricing strategies. Positions become entrenched between different sectors, and the actions that are needed to support high-quality R&D - particularly in the private sector - have frequently ended up being cast as at odds with the imperative of access. In truth, there is a need to do more to recognise the multifaceted nature of the issue, and the shared efforts required to unpick its complexities. Only by establishing a consistent, collaborative approach by all actors to issues such as licensing, pricing and access planning at every stage of product development can the ecosystem truly deliver on the goal of access and innovation in harmony. What is the change we want to see? Access embedded as an essential component of product development cycles and the infectious disease R&D ecosystem as a whole With the right international mechanisms in place, there is no reason why improving access to a product in low-income settings should be at the expense of its profitability in high-income settings. There is a need to ensure that access is routinely embedded at every stage of any product's development . Access plans have become a major tool to support this, with some R&D support initiatives (such as CEPI and CARB-X ) and funders now making them a condition of financial support. Over time, both the scale of ambition and consistency of standards in access plans must be developed. This must be supported by accountability mechanisms to hold product developers to account if they do not implement them. Within this, pricing should remain a lynchpin of access strategies , as affordability still presents a major barrier to the widespread use of products in certain countries. A one-size-fits-all approach will not be appropriate given the different innovation environments and markets for different products. Funders and developers must be prepared to use a range of pricing options that will allow products to be made available to the communities that need them at a price they can afford (Box 4). Access plans should also build in strategies for wide registration of products across countries and regions . Ultimately, products that are made available in high-income countries should also be routinely made available in lower-income settings, without extended time lags. Growing regulatory maturity of different jurisdictions should support this, as well as more progressive thinking about pricing strategies and market shaping that would make low- and middle-income countries a more attractive prospect for product developers. Broadly conceived access plans taking a true end-to-end approach should also consider characteristics of a product - such as how it is administered or stored - from the earliest stages of development. Ensuring the product is appropriate for the environment in which it will be used will be particularly important for products needed in low- resource settings where health care delivery may be less well resourced. Research leadership from within high-burden countries, along with engagement of affected communities, will be vital to support this, as these groups have the deepest insights into need. Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovationTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 36Box 4: Building access into product pricing strategies Strategies for measuring, monitoring, and managing prices are essential for promoting access to products for all. There is no single approach that suits all systems or situations. But there is a universal need to promote access to effective new products, by ensuring that medical advances are affordable, and working with all stakeholders to respond in a sustainable way to public health needs.54 There are means to improve product pricing in ways that increase transparency, affordability and access while still reflecting the value of product innovation.55 Fixed pricing obligations are those that set a specific price threshold, either as a maximum absolute price cap, a maximum percentage markup on the cost of goods (COGS) - known as 'cost plus' - or an obligation to sell a product at no profit. Some funders and PDPs also require their development partners to match the price of comparable products that are entering the market. Soft pricing obligations mean that developers must try to set an 'affordable' price for their product, but there are no specific thresholds for the price itself. This might include obligations included in funding agreements that recognise the need for a price that is both affordable for affected communities and commercially sustainable for the developer, asking for long- term and widespread access to the product to be prioritised in marketing approaches. Indirect obligations include several additional provisions that can operate in parallel with fixed and/or soft pricing obligations to help achieve an affordable price and ensure that the commercial value is shared equitably. These include the following: Alternative manufacturing provisions mandate that the technology be transferred to another manufacturer who can make the product more cheaply. This may occur either at a particular point, such as when regulatory approval is received, or if the developer cannot make the product at an affordable price itself. Voluntary licensing agreements enable the holders of global IP rights to licence manufacturers to produce cheaper versions of patented products for sale at lower prices in defined markets, usually low- and middle- income countries. Tiered pricing is also an option to support access for products that have dual markets in high-income and lower-income countries, allowing profits to be made in some countries while affordability is prioritised in others. The options outlined above are not always mutually exclusive, but their suitability can depend on the specific context. For example, options could be limited to certain geographical areas (e.g. countries or subnational programmes) and potentially certain time periods (e.g. during pandemics).56 Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovationTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 37The public, private and philanthropic sectors work more closely together to stimulate innovation, and improve equitable access A lot of the responsibility for delivering step changes in access will sit with product developers themselves, but success can be accelerated by other actors in the system with the right enabling environment. Collaborative approaches that bring a cross-section of stakeholders into access initiatives will be the most effective way to create sustainable change and encourage long-term engagement from companies on access issues, recognising the crucial role different stakeholders can play. For example, to address gaps and achieve greater impact, existing GHIs and PDPs could be scaled up and applied more systematically across the infectious disease landscape . In particular, the systematic divide between PDPs focused on product development, and GHIs designed to drive access, warrants further consideration when reflecting on ways to ensure that access and innovation are more closely linked as key goals of the R&D ecosystem for infectious disease. As a different approach, actors with remit to monitor and reward companies that take concrete action towards access and social good have a major role to play in driving corporate engagement in access issues . Groups such as the Access to Medicine Foundation (ATMF) have played a crucial role in tracking commitments through the Access to Medicine Index (ATMI),57 an important framework both to monitor companies' actions on access, and to use comparison with their peers to encourage them to do more. Investor influence is another strategy that should be increasingly used to drive access commitments from the private sector . As the company owners, major shareholders can directly influence strategic approach and hold leadership to account for their performance. Sustained action by shareholders is already used to notable effect in other areas, such as climate change, and has the potential to encourage pharmaceutical companies to integrate action on equitable access (and infectious disease R&D more generally) as an issue of core corporate strategy, rather than more discretionary corporate social responsibility (CSR) or environmental and social governance (ESG) activities. Develop alternative business models that place equal emphasis on innovation and equitable access There will ultimately be limitations to the impact and reach of voluntary activity on access within the private sector. Encouraging more proactive engagement by companies in R&D and equitable access efforts is likely to be most effective in areas where dual markets exist for products. In areas of infectious disease where no viable commercial markets exist in any part of the world, more fundamental consideration is needed around how to sustainably enable private companies to engage in product development. In these cases, business models that centre access and global needs rather than focusing on narrow bottom-line profits have a key role to play. These business models already exist on a small scale within the infectious disease R&D ecosystem (Box 5), but more can be done to learn from successes and scale up existing initiatives. Alternative approaches to partnership and funding could also create change. Impact investors - private equity investors focused on social purpose - and philanthropists are increasingly exploring how to support important areas of medical R&D, either through dedicated funds (such as the AMR Impact Fund) or working with individual product developers. These approaches and business models challenge conventional views of how companies balance the pursuit of profit with a wider social purpose, or how philanthropists (and sometimes governments) deploy funding - de-risking and leveraging private investors in R&D rather than directly funding it themselves. So far, they have not been deployed at scale across the infectious disease R&D ecosystem, but new business models, and new approaches to combining public, private and philanthropic funds might hold significant potential for addressing some of the systemic challenges outlined in earlier chapters. Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovationTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 38Box 5: Alternative partnerships and business models Product innovation is commonly driven by the pharmaceutical sector through traditional commercial models. However, this can undermine access as products must provide return on investment for businesses to remain viable. As a result, products for neglected or rare diseases are deprioritised, and even when products are developed, they can still be unaffordable for many, or not marketed in certain countries where return on investment is thought to be limited. To counter these issues, new initiatives have been developed based on alternative business models for infectious disease innovation. These models put access at the centre, focusing on developing products for global public good rather than private gain. Frequently these initiatives operate as PDPs - non-profit organisations built on partnerships between private sector, academic and public or philanthropic stakeholders. This brings together the strengths of different stakeholder groups, allowing partners to share risk, split costs, and cooperate to drive innovation that brings public good. Partnerships like this have been successful at supporting development of much needed products, with PDPs responsible for bringing 50 new products to market over the last 20 years for critical diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria.58 Although these partnerships do not yet operate at a scale large enough to rival big pharmaceutical innovation companies, their approach provides clear proof of concept to be learnt from and further developed. An example of a partnership like this is Hilleman Laboratories , a joint venture between Wellcome Trust and Merck & Co, Inc. The mission of this programme is to develop safe, effective and affordable vaccines and biologics that address areas of unmet need. The programme is currently developing rotavirus, cholera and meningococcal vaccines, with a focus on products that are appropriate for delivery in low-resource settings. These partnership models go beyond addressing pipeline gaps, with some of them set up to help assure supply of and access to medicines. For example, Civica was set up by a coalition of healthcare providers, philanthropies and impact investors in response to frequent shortages of essential generic drugs in the US market alongside steep price increases. This initiative acts to manufacture and assure supply of a portfolio of essential hospital medicines, including key antibiotics. The model used bypasses major drug makers by pooling demand for generic pharmaceuticals at member hospitals, increasing efficiency and decreasing costs by taking on responsibility for manufacturing directly.59 Change area 4 - Centring access and affordability while incentivising innovationTowards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 39What are potential mechanisms for change? Comprehensive access plans Funders require end-to-end access plans for all products in development projects they support, and hold developers to account for implementing them. Extend norms towards having access plans developed from end-to-end for all product development projects, regardless of who funds them. Access plans routinely include content supporting access from end-to-end of the product development process - such as pricing strategies, registration requirements and requirements ensuring the appropriateness of the product for a variety of settings. Pricing strategies Funders more routinely put wording on pricing obligations into funding contracts, ensuring public good comes from public or philanthropic funds. Developers embrace a wider range of pricing options, tailoring the approach based on the best fit for the product and expected market. Extend existing access mechanisms Reflect on how the GHIs and PDPs can be positioned to cover infectious diseases more systematically. Explore how GHIs and PDPs could more strongly integrate product development into access initiatives.Monitoring and accountability Scale up strategies to monitor and reward commitments from companies towards improving access and social good, driving corporate engagement in access issues from across the private sector. Leverage the influence of investors on the ESG commitments of companies to better prioritise access within commercially viable ventures. Innovative business models Develop business models that enable companies to pursue a more values-driven approach to R&D, focused on disease areas and products that are most needed but that lack viable commercial markets. Scale up the number and size of ventures based on values-driven models, testing approaches, and providing further proof of concept. Develop new approaches to combining public, private and philanthropic funds. Develop new impact investment funds that present alternative funding mechanisms and take a mission-led approach to supporting infectious disease R&D.Key questions to address 1.

Are there areas where the private sector could make greater strides to support access, without damaging the commercial viability needed to drive sustainable innovation? 3. Beyond the actions of the private sector, what more is needed from donors, governments and civil society to achieve greater access to new products?

Are there other options for what novel business models or commercial partnerships for controlling and treating escalating infectious diseases could look like? What can we learn from other sectors? 5. Are there areas related to access where compromise can be achieved between private, public and civil society sectors, so that entrenched positions can be unpicked (such as on IP and transparency), and greater progress achieved?

Regardless of country or setting, antibiotics are essential to patient health, the maintenance of healthcare systems and global health security. However, over time, the repeated exposure of bacteria to antibiotics leads to the development of resistance to these treatments, making them less effective for treating infections - a process known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Drug resistant infections are already having significant impact all over the world, directly causing 1.27 million deaths in 2019, 255,000 of which were in sub-Saharan Africa.60 Researcher working with individually isolated bacterial strains to test the activity of Vedanta's defined drug candidates against bacterial pathogens Image credit: Bearwalk Cinema Case study 6: Antibiotic innovation Towards a reformed R&D ecosystem for infectious disease | 41Why is the antibiotic market broken? Due to the continuing emergence of resistance infections, sustainable investment in antibiotic innovation will be critical to ensure we have working antibiotic options well into the future. However, investment in antibiotic R&D remains insufficient, resulting in weak pipelines and no new classes of antibiotics being discovered since the 1980s.61 This under-investment stems from failure within antibiotic markets. The private sector - particularly large pharmaceutical companies - lack incentives to invest in antibiotic innovation as it is not as profitable as the development of other drugs. Given uncertain patterns of drug resistance, and the availability of cheap and (currently) mostly effective antibiotics, little profit can be made from developing and bringing new ones to market. Truly novel antibiotics will inevitably be reserved for use only in instances where cheaper generic drugs fail, meaning they are unlikely to be sold in volume. As a result, large pharmaceutical companies have mostly sold off their antibiotic portfolios and essentially exited the market. This has left antibiotic R&D largely driven by small biopharmaceutical companies, often supported by early-stage philanthropic funding. However, given the difficult commercial environment, these smaller companies continue to face significant challenges and are at risk of going out of business even if they successfully bring new antibiotics to market. This is exemplified by Achaogen, a biotechnology company that went bankrupt in 2019, despite successfully developing and bringing to market a new antibiotic.62What can be done to bring more new antibiotics to market? Industry, governments and philanthropy have important roles to play to support critical new antibiotics coming onto the market, particularly in coordinating and financing antibiotic R&D. For example, the Global AMR R&D Hub works to coordinate funders of R&D efforts, identifying priority areas for research so investments are made in the most effective and efficient way. Scaling up financing is also critical, as seen through the significant sources of 'push' funding for antibiotic development now coming from CARB-X for early- stage research, and the AMR Action Fund for late-stage clinical trials and registration. While these approaches bolster funding for antibiotic development, addressing market failures will be vital if antibiotic innovation is to become more sustainable in the long-term. Introducing new reimbursement models could be one way to achieve this, rethinking how antibiotics are paid for in a way that recognises their true value and makes development more economically viable. For example, the UK is currently testing a subscription model where the National Health Service (NHS) pays for new antibiotics at a set price annually, regardless of the amount used. A similar subscription model is also being considered in the US through the Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Upsurging Resistance (PASTEUR) Act. If successful, this could be a significant step towards enhancing the competitiveness and profitability of antibiotic development, particularly given the size of the US market.
