Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 9 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. CODE of ORGANIZATIONAL AND BUSINESS ETHICS (SMH Specific) Subject Matter Expert: Richard Demme, MD (275 -5800) The mission statement and 12 principles of the Code of Organizational and Business Ethics are displayed in the admissions offices of Strong Memorial Hospital and are printed in Orientation literature for all employees. The 12 principles of the Code of Ethics are as follows: Principle 1 - Respect for Patients Respect for the people for whom we are privileged to care is our first and greatest concern. We will provide health care without regard to race, creed, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, or ability to pay, and will respect each patient's unique background, culture, beliefs, and needs. Each of us bears a moral obligation to our patie nts to respect the value and dignity of human life, and this duty outweighs our own personal and financial interests. The Hospital has a Charity Care Program to support this principle. Principle 2 - Relief of Suffering Curing disease, reducing suffering an d achieving an acceptable quality of life as defined by the patient are central goals of our institution. Patient suffering must always be addressed. Treatment for relief of symptoms and curative treatment are both treated with importance. Principle 3 - Communication With Patients A diagnosis is not just an identification of a disease, but may also carry with it serious emotional, social and financial burdens for patients and those close to them, including the burden of making and living with difficult cho ices. It is our responsibility to offer support and assistance by providing patients and their families with all the information they need to make sound decisions. This includes the timely sharing of information about the expected or unexpected outcomes o f care with the patient or family. Principle 4 - Confidentiality of Patient Information Patient information is confidential and should not be disclosed without the patient's consent, except as provided by law. All information must be recorded accurately an d communicated responsibly. Patient identity is to be protected especially in all public places, including hallways, elevators, and waiting rooms. Those with access to patient information have an obligation to protect patient privacy. .....continues..... Page 10 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. CODE OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND BUSINESS ETHICS - SMH (continued) Principle 5 - Patient Access to Health Care Registration, admission, transfer and discharge of patients are based on the patient's welfare and personal preferences, without regard to their ability to pay. Out of respect for patients and their concerns, we have established procedures to expeditiously and fairly resolve patient concerns or disputes arising over registration, admission, transfer, discharge, billing and payment. We will do all we can to help patients find resources to cover the cost of their care and the optimal setting for that care. Principle 6 - Interdisciplinary Relations Good patient care requires the collaboration of many different people providing a range of services, and effective communication and coordination between the care providers are essential to the welfare of our patients. Such collaboration requires the mutu al respect of all the employees, students, trainees, volunteers, and faculty who are involved in the care. Principal 7 - Conflicts of Interest All clinical decisions, including tests, treatment, procedures, and follow -up care will be based on the patient's needs, and not on the financial interests of the hospital or its leaders, managers, staff or practitioners. Professional Integrity Our faculty must disclose any ownership, employment, equity interest, stock options, or consulting relationship they or their immediate family members have with a company involved with a product they are using for patient care, research, or publication. Corporate Integrity We will pursue business relationships that are free from potential conflicts of interest in the practi ces and contractual relationships at all levels of the institution. Patients have the right to full disclosure about the existence of any business relationships among the hospitals, educational programs, providers, payers or networks that may influence the patient's care and treatment plan. Principle 8 - Preventive Health Care Disease prevention is an essential part of our mission. Through public education, community preventive service and research, we can reduce the incidence of illness and thus serve people who may never be our patients. Our responsibility to our neighbors and community also extends to a concern to produce and preserve a healthy environment. Principle 9 - Education and Ethics Education is both an investment in a better future and a tribute to past generations of patients and scholars. We commit ourselves to further progress against disease by sharing the knowledge, skills and ethical values that are the foundation of this insti tution. Educational programs and Ethics consultation are available to patients, their families, the community and our staff, volunteers, and faculty. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 11 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. CODE OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND BUSINESS ETHICS - SMH (continued) Principle 10 - Research Ethics Basic and clinical research are central to our mission. They are fundamental to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately, to the eradication of disease. Research requires activities that are anticipated to improve patient care in the future, and participants who are fully and adequately informed about the risks and benefits, including all reasonable alternatives. Research must reflect the highest standard s of integrity including accurately collected, precisely analyzed and honestly reported data Principle 11 - Cost Containment and Allocation of Resources Medical care, disease prevention and medical education and research are costly endeavors demanding cons cientious stewardship; however, financial considerations should not dictate the quality of care offered to each patient. When the hospital must address the fair distribution of limited health care resources, the relative efficacy and financial costs will be considered, with the goal of maximizing health benefits using available resources. We will use both financial and natural resources conservatively, not wastefully. Quality assurance procedures will be followed to control costs and avoid unnecessary tests, treatments, or procedures. Principle 12 - Marketing Practices Marketing practices for medical services carry a unique responsibility that require special care to avoid manipulating people made vulnerable by illness. Ethical marketing requires providing accurate and unbiased information in all of our communications, public relations and advertising. Page 12 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed.

DISASTER PREPAREDNESS Subject Matter A disaster occurs when events: Overload the capacity and/or ability of the ED or Hospital units to care for the injured or ill, causing significant disruption to normal Hospital operations. Cause other community agencies to request support from URMC -Strong or Highland Hospital departments. Of a biological, chemical, or radiological materials nature seve rely impact any part of the hospital community (such as receipt of a suspicious letter or package). The occurrence of any of the above may result in the Hospital activating its disaster response plan. Sequence of Events The Emergency Department (ED) will r outinely be the first to be notified, and: 1. The ED charge nurse will confer with the Administrator -on-Call (AOC) and then notify the Page Office at URMC -Strong Hospital or Telecommunications at Highland Hospital. 2.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUS ION Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Stanley Byrd (275 -0425) HH: Kathleen Gallucci (341 -0118) Philosophy At the University of Rochester and Highland Hospital diversity means that we believe everyone is unique and has different talents and abilities. All of us contribute in various ways to provide our customers, the organization, and the community with excellent service. When we value diversity we can fulfill our highest potential as a team and as individuals. Dimensions of Diversity To meet the needs of each person we interact with, we must be trained to understand the complex dimensions of diversity. These include, but are not limited to: Age Physical or mental abilities Race Culture Ethnicity Sexual orientation Gender Learning abilities By examining our own attitudes, values, and behavior (as well as those of others), we begin to achieve real understanding. Teamwork is essential in a diverse work force. Qualified and diverse team members learn to respect each other's differences. Job satisfaction will be greatly increased if each employee is valued and treated with respect. Every employee will become empowered to build strength for our team. When each member of a team has high morale, the productivity of the organizati on and the quality of service will be enhanced. This leads to increased customer satisfaction and improved community relations. It is up to each of us to learn about others and address individual needs so we can work together to serve our customers. We ar e stronger through diversity. Inclusion Inclusion means creating an organizational environment and culture where every employee feels valued and is able to function at his or her best. The key to inclusion is harnessing the talents, strengths and personal motivation of each individual in our diverse workforce and aligning each person's talents, abilities and skills with the organization's goals, mission and values. .....continues..... Page 16 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION (continued) It is important to remember: Our workforce is diverse; we must respect differences and make them work for us. Interpersonal relations and organizational effectiveness are improved through encouraging new ideas and perspectives. Stereotypical views of others limit our ability to understand those different from us. Every human being is unique; we need to create an environment where all employees feel they can contribute to their fullest potential.

Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 25 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FIRE SAFETY Subject Matter Experts: http://intranet.urmc -sh.rochester.edu/highland/Policy/envCare (Section 1) Fire Prevention Fire prevention should be paramount in everyone's mind. Our number -one life safety finding is improper storage of materials in the corridor or stairwells. The number -two finding is blocked life safety equipment because of this storage. Be aware of excessive use of extension cords, faulty electrical devices or frayed electrical cords; these can easily start a fire. Be on the alert for conditions that may lead to rapid fire spread or hinder safe evacuation. Obstructed corridors Openings in walls and ceilings Propped open or blocked fire doors Blocked extinguishers, pull stations, or gas shut -off valves Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM) Life safety features (for example, a fire alarm system) are put into place to protect individuals working in the building. When the hospital is unable to maintain a life safety feature due to construction, maintenance, renovations, or the device/system fails , an Interim Life Safety Measure (ILSM) must be implemented. For example: If the fire alarm system was malfunctioning, the hospital would be required to take other measures to ensure the safety of the occupants In that instance , a fire watch could be established where employees would be physically patrolling the area for signs of smoke or fire Patient Fires Extinguish with a bed covering such as bedspread, blanket, or sheet. Protect yourself by wrapping your hands inside the material, lean tight against the bed to prevent flashback Quickly drape the extinguishing material completely over the patient, remembering to protect th e patient's face first and to tuck the material into every crevice formed by the patient's body (for example, between legs and under back). Please see the Emergency Preparedness Manual for specifics pertaining to your department's procedures so you will kn ow what to do in case of a fire or other emergency. .....continues..... Page 26 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FIRE SAFETY (continued) When Pages or Alarms Sound It is important to remember RACE: Rescue anyone in immediate danger, relocate him or her to a safe area. Below waist level, the air is relatively cool and clean, allowing for escape by staying low and moving quickly. Alarm everyone whenever there is evidence of fire, by using a pull station. Cal l 13 at URMC -SMH or 1-6666 at Highland ; state your name, the nature of problem and the location. Confine the fire by closing all doors immediately upon discovery of fire. The door leading to the room of origin should be closed immediately and kept closed. Do not open windows. Extinguish a small contained fire if trained, but without endangering yourself or others. A clear exit path should be maintained to prevent being trapped by rapidly spreading fire. It is important to remember Evacuation Guidelines : If fire conditions seem to be worsening, evacuation should be assessed. Guidelines for determining evacuation are as follows: Fire has spread to the structure such as walls or ceiling. Several items of furnishings are involved in the fire. Smoke appears to be spreading unchecked from the room of origin. Orders are received from a person listed as qualified to call an evacuation. If the room(s) is evacuated, obtain chalk from the nearest fire extinguisher cabinet and chalk the lower hinged side of the door wi th a slash. It is important to remember Fire Extinguisher Operation (PASS) Pull the pin Aim the horn or hose at the base of the fire Squeeze the handle Sweep at the base of the fire .....continues.....

HAND HYGIENE ---SIMPLE, BUT EFFECTIVE Subject Matter Expert: SMH and HH : Ann Marie Pettis (275-5056 / 341 -6853) Hand Hygiene Frequent and thorough hand hygiene is the single most effective thing we can do to protect our patients, ourselves, and our lo ved ones from infection. Although the action of hand hygiene is simple, the lack of compliance on the part of the heath care worker (HCW) continues to be a problem in the United States and around the world. The Joint Commission requires each organization to select and fully implement either the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines. URMC has chosen to follow the WHO's hand hygiene guidelines which are based on \"My Five Moments of Hand Hygiene.\" \"My Five Moments of Hand Hygiene\" Hand Hygiene Methods Either waterless, alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) or soap and water at a sink can be used when performing hand hygiene. However, both WHO and CDC say that the use of alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) shou ld be the primary method health care workers (HCWs) use to sanitize their hands with the following exceptions: After using the restroom Before eating When hands are visibly soiled .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 29 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. HAND HYGIENE ---SIMPLE, BUT EFFECTIVE (continued) Recommended amount of time for adequate hand hygiene is 15 -20 seconds (the amount of time it takes to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice ). Remember that friction is most important, and we must not short -cut the process. During cold weather the integrity of our s kin can become compromised with frequent hand hygiene. Use hospital -approved hand lotion. Unapproved lotion is not allowed. Patient Hand Hygiene As important as it is for HCWs to use proper hand hygiene to protect our patients from healthcare - associated i nfections (HAIs), it may be equally important that patients themselves use frequent hand hygiene as well. Hand sanitizer pads are provided on all meal trays, and small bottles of hand rub are available to distribute to patients, if appropriate from a safe ty standpoint. Reminding patients to clean their hands before eating and after using the restroom or a bedpan is a necessity. It is important to remember : Frequent and thorough hand hygiene is the single most effective thing we can do to protect our pati ents, ourselves, and our loved ones from infection. Sanitize your hands: Before touching a patient Before clean/aseptic procedures After body fluid exposure/risk After touching a patient and contact with the patient's environment The amount of time for adequate hand hygiene is 15 -20 seconds (singing \"Happy Birthday\" twice). Waterless ABHR or soap and water at a sink can be used for hand hygiene, but the primary method health care workers should use for hand hygiene is ABHR. The exceptions for use of ABHR are after using the restroom, before eating, or when hands are visibly soiled. Remind patients to use frequent hand hygiene as well, especially before eating and after using the restroom or a bedpan. Be sure the patient and/or their family see you perform hand hygiene.

HAZARD COMMUNICATION STANDARD (continued) Globally Harmonized Safety Data Sheets It is important to remember : Transmission of critical information about chemicals is accomplished by reading labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and through employee training. Hazardous chemicals are chemicals that have been classified as health hazards or physical hazards. The updated Hazard Communication Standard of 2012 req uires all chemical labels contain 6 elements: Product Identifier Signal Words Hazard Statements Pictograms Precautionary Statements Chemical manufacturer contact information Pictograms facilitate communication globally by reducing language barriers. You need to recognize and understand the 9 Hazard Communication Standard Pictograms. Safety Data Sheets (formerly MSDSs) will now follow the same format according to the updated standard. Every SDS will have the same 16 sections, in the same order, and with the same titles. Employees exposed to a hazardous chemical must take immediate action to minimize possible health effects. Immediate first aid may include rinsing of eyes or skin (at the point the chemical made contact) for at least 15 minutes and seeking m edical attention. Small spills can be cleaned by personnel who are aware of the hazards of the spilled material. The proper personal protective equipment must be u sed. For large chemical spills , or if sufficiently trained personnel are not available, immed iately leave the area and call the Department of Public Safety at x13 at SMH or Security at x1 - 6666 at Highland Hospital if the spill is on -site. If off -site, call 9 -1-1. An employee should remain at a safe distance and keep others out of the area until em ergency personnel can arrive.

INFECTION PREVENTION (including updates on OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standards and Tuberculosis) Subject Matter Expert: SMH and HH: 341 -6853) General Infection Prevention Practices Safeguard Both Patients and Personnel. Infections are transmitted by several different routes. The specific route of transmission is dependent on the germ involved. Infection Prevention policies and isolation precautions are designed to interrupt transmission. Standard Precautions A prevention strategy which applies to all patients. There are additional enhanced or \"transmission -based\" precaution categories which ap ply only to patients with particular diseases. When in effect, these enhanced precautions : Must be followed by all personnel as well as family and visitors even if they do not plan on coming in contact with the patient's environment . Are clearly specified on isolation signs located outside the patient's room and documented in the patient's medical record. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the federal government requires all hospitals to have poli cies to protect employees from infection caused by bloodborne pathogens, especially the viruses which cause AIDS (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. These policies are found in a document called the \"Bloodborne Exposure Control Plan.\" All employees are required to comply with these policies . Those at risk should have received OSHA training. If you have not received OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens training, contact your supervisor or department head. Report Any Exposure As Soon As Possible and Notify Your Super visor/ Manager SMH : Immediately call Occupational & Environmental Medicine at 275 -1164. Complete an Employee Incident Report Form (SMH 115) online at http://www.safety.rochester.edu/SMH115.html Include the type and brand involved in all sharps injuries (e.g., safety glide syringe, BD.)

Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 39 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. INFECTION PREV ENTION (continued) It is important to remember: Hand hygiene is the most important method of preventing the spread of infection. All equipment that goes from patient to patient must be sanitized before use. Respiratory hygiene, which means covering your nose and mouth with a tissue or your sleeve when you sneeze or cough, will also help prevent the spread of germs that cause illnesses like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The blood and body fluids of all persons must be considered potentia lly infectious. Standard Precautions apply to all patients. Do not recap needles. Many needle sticks occur during the process of recapping needles. Exceptions: recapping of needles is unavoidable in some situations. A one -handed technique is used for safe recapping of the needle when necessary. If you experience skin exposure to blood or body fluids, cleanse skin with soap and water. For a needle stick, cut, or exposure through broken skin, wash the affected area with soap and water. For oral exposure, ri nse mouth well with water. For eyes, rinse well with sterile saline or tap water (after removing contact lenses). An eyewash station should be used if possible. Report any exposure as soon as possible using the appropriate form for your organization and notify your supervisor/manager. All staff should be vaccinated against influenza every year. Annual fit testing is required for staff who wear N95 masks for respiratory protection . An annual Tuberculin Skin Test (TST/PPD) is required for all staff. A priva te room with negative pressure and a closed door are used to prevent the transmission of TB.

INFLUENZA \u2014WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW Subject Matter Expert SMH and HH: Marie Pettis Influenza Plan\") Both locations : URMC FLU SOURCE (You must be on the URMC network to access this content. ) Types of Flu Seasonal Flu Influenza or \"flu\" is a respiratory infection caused by influenza virus spread from person to perso n. The flu that strikes every winter is called \"seasonal\" flu. Most people who get the flu will recover within a week, but flu and its complications can be life -threatening for the elderly, newborn babies, and people with chronic illness. Pandemic Flu Caused by a new strain of influenza A virus that causes a global (or pandemic) outbreak of seri ous illness which may be accompanied by high rates of death. Because there is little natural immunity, the disease can spread easily from person to person. The influenza A virus which caused the 2009 pandemic affected a preponderance of young and healthy individuals. Pregnancy was also a risk factor for more severe disease. How the Flu Is Spread Flu can be spread from person to person by: Droplets released into the air when a person with flu coughs or sneezes within 3 - 6 feet of another person. Occasionally by aerosols of tiny virus particles that can travel longer than 3 -6 feet from the coughing person and then are inhaled (e.g. , across a room or down a corridor) . Touching surfaces such as a doorknob or telephone contaminated with respiratory secretions from a person with flu, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. It is important to remember: The best way to prevent flu is to receive flu vaccine prior to the flu season. Stay home if you are sick: Fever (temperature of 37.8 C or 100 F or greater ), cough, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, body aches and headache. .....continues.... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 41 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. INFLUENZA \u2014WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (continued) Cover your cough. Always cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and dispose of the tissue Use your upper sleeve (not hands) to cover your cough if tissue is not available. Hand hygiene Always use alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) or wash hands before and after touching any patient or their environment. Use hand hygiene frequently during the course of the day and avoid touching your face. Always wear a mask when you are within 3 -6 feet of patients with symptoms. Surgical masks are used during typical seasonal flu. N-95 masks are recommended during aerosol -generating procedures such as intubati on or extubation, bronchoscopy, or open suctioning. Health care workers who have not received flu vaccine must wear a surgical mask whenever they come within 6 feet of a patient. This requirement goes into effect when the NYS Health Commissioner determine s that flu is widespread.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN URMC/HH and I NDUSTRY Subject Matter Expert s: URMC/SMH : Robert Panzer, -4438) Between URMC/HH & Industry The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) and affiliates, including Highland Hospital (HH), have numerous interactions with the various Industries and their representatives. These interactions are mostly positive and benefit URMC/HH and their patie nts, promoting in various ways all of our missions. While beneficial in many instances, some interactions with industry can create conflicts of interest when industry promotes use of a product that may not be in the best clinical or financial interest for URMC/HH and their patients. Hospital policy states URMC/HH faculty, staff, and students may not accept gifts (including meals) from industry or its representatives. While the policy does not prohibit use of medication samples, educational grants, or indus try support of public conferences and continuing education events, some restrictions are imposed to ensure they are free from potential for bias. Site access by sales and marketing reps can only occur by appointment in both patient care and non-patient care areas. The policy also contains information on disclosure of relationships with industry. It is important to remember: Gifts and compensation, including meals, from industry or its representatives should not be accepted. Sales and marketing represent ative visits can occur only by appointment in both patient care and non-patient care areas.

INTERPRETER SERVICES (continued) Using an Interpreter Stand next to the interpreter, look directly at patient so he/she can see your facial expressions. Speak in first per son, not \"tell him or her......\" Interpreters will convey everything that is said; do not say anything you do not want the patient to know until you leave the room. Do not assume hard of hearing or deaf patients using Sign Language with \"good speech\" can lip r ead and fully understand the conversation; offer the use of a SL interpreter. It is important to remember: The New York State Health Code states comprehensive interpreter services are required. It is hospital policy to use only hospital -designated interpreters. When using an interpreter position yourself next to the interpreter (so the patient can read your facial expressions); look and speak directly to the patient. If a patient uses Sign Language as their primary mode of communication, be sure to offer interpreter services; don't assume they can lip -read and fully understand the conversation. Interpreters will convey everything that is said; do not say anything you do not want the patient to know until you leave the room.

JOINT COMMISSION READINESS Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Ann Peterson Ottman (276-6065 ) Joint Commission? The Joint Commission, is an agency that evaluates ho w well healthcare organizations provide safe and high quality patient care. Joint Commission reviewers periodically visit our facilities to observe how we provide care and to ensure we are meeting the Joint Commission standards. They also survey on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We are currently eligible for a visit. Visits, called surveys, are unannounced so we need to be ready at all times. Be Ready for a Joint Commission Visit: Wear your ID Badge, and at SMH the whi te badge card with the emergency page codes, at all times. Be able to discuss how your role supports quality and safe patient care. Be familiar with the National Patient Safety Goals and how you are compliant with them. Know the mission and vision of the organization. Know where to find information on the intranet \u2014e.g., policy and procedure manuals, clinical practice guidelines, safety alerts. Be sure you understand a surveyor's question before answering. If you do not know the answer, it is fine to say, \"I don't know the answer, but I do know where to find it.\" Reporting Care and Safety Concerns : Staff are encouraged to r eport concerns about care and safety through their management structure o r at: SMH : call the Medical Director's Hotline (3 -CARE). Highland : call Administration or Quality Management (341 -8423). If a staff member is still not satisfied, they may report their concern to the Joint Commission at 1 -800-994-6610 or via e -mail at compla int@jointcommission.org . Patients/families are encouraged to participate actively in their care and report any safety or quality concerns to their caregivers or to the Patient and Family Relations Coordinator. .....continues....

LIFTING AND TRANSFERS: POSTURE AND BODY MECHANICS Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Kathleen Owens (341 (Healthy Back Device) www.medical -supplies Transfer Slide & Gurney) www.allegromedical.com (Transfer Belts) www.osha.gov/SLTC/ergonomics/index.html Posture 1. What is good posture? Standing: head straight up with chin in, shoulders back, and pelvis in neutral position (tighten abdominal muscles). Sitting : head straight up with chin in, shoulders back; all three curves should be present in your back. If possible, elbows should rest on armrests , shoulders should be relax ed, and feet should rest flat on the floor or a footrest. Take frequent breaks to change position and stretch, reversing any prolonged postures. 2. Why is good posture important? Keeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are properly used. Decrease s abnormal wearing of joint surfaces. Decreases stress on the ligaments ho lding the joints of the spine together. Prevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions. Prevents backache and muscular pain. Decreases the probability of back injuries during lifting or heavy exertion. 3. What is the result of poor posture? Musc les are in weakened positions Increased potential for injury Pain, discomfort General Lifting Guidelines 1. Keep the three curves of your spine in line \u2014especially your lumbar curve. Try not to twist. 2. Bend at the hips, knees and ankles \u2014not the spine. 3. Use leg muscles. Leg muscles are bigger and stronger than back muscles. 4. Feet should be shoulder -width apart with the load positioned at midline. 5. Keep the load as close to the body as possible. Avoid reaching \u2014keep objects between shoulder and waist height. The clo ser the object is to you, the less the torque on your back. .....continues....

Use assistive technology to save your back (for example, transfer belts, Hoyer lift, hover mat, plastic sheeting, slide boards). General Transfer Guidelines 1. Determine the patient's needs. 2. Prepare the patient; explain what you are doing, how they can help. 3. Set up equipment to be used. 4. To save your back, use assistive technology such as transfer belts (available through Hospital Stores at SMH and on nursing units at HH), Hoyer lift, hover mat, plastic sheeting and slide boards. 5. Prepare the environment: room free of clutter, lights on, floor dry, minimize distractions. 6. Prepare everyone involved in the transfer. Ask for help before you need it. The patient and all assistants need to know how and when the transfer will occur; ask the patient to help. 7. Perform the transfer.

Do not use these abbreviations in medical record documentation: U, IU, QD, QOD, trailing zero X.0 mg, Lack of leading zero .Xmg, MS, MSO 4, MgSO 4, u g, T.I.W., A.S., A.D., A.U. It is important to remember: A culture of safety needs the entire team's involvement in providing accurate, timely communication to reduce the #1 root cause of serious patient events. All actual events and near misses should be entered in the electronic event reporting system (RL Solutions) so unsafe trends can be tracked and eliminated. Never use these abbreviations in any medical record documentation: (U, IU, QD, QOD, trailing zero X.0 mg, Lack of leading zero .Xmg, MS, MSO 4, MgSO 4, u g, T.I. W., A.S., A.D., A.U.).

PROVIDING BETTER CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THROUGH COMMUNICATION Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Steven Sulkes, MD (275-2986 ) HH: Daniel Mendelson, MD (341-0888) Objectives 1. Increase awareness of communicating with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. 2. Provide some strategies for improving communication and service. Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Developmental disabilities (DDs) are severe c hronic conditions that can be cognitive, physical or both. DDs are marked by impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas and occur before the age of 21 . Intellectual disabilities (IDs) are characterized by difficulties in intellectual fun ctioning and adaptive behavior. People with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) include those with cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and many other syndromes and conditions. Preferred Terminology In recent years, the term \"Intellectual Disability\" has replaced the stigmatizing term \"Mental Retardation .\" How Are People With IDD Impacted by Their Disability? Impacts of IDD vary from person to person and can include difficulties with: - Mobility - Learning - Communication - Adaptive skills An individual's disability is not always visible. Each person with an intellectual or developmental disability has his or her own unique interests, strengths and challenges. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 71 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. PROVIDING BETTER CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THROUGH COMMUNICATION (continued) Communicating With an Individual With IDD Find out how the person best communicates. For example, some people benefit from picture communication Speak directly to the person, in stead of the parent or caregiver Simplify language Allow time for the patient to process information; check in with the patient to ensure understanding Be truthful: \"The shot will hurt a little, not a lot .\" Use People First Language: \"Kevin is a 14-year-old boy with autism\" not \"The autistic boy .\" Health Care for People With IDD Having a disability does not mean a person is not healthy. But people with IDD have been shown to have poorer health and dental care than people without IDD Health condi tions experienced by people with IDD are not necessarily related to their disability. Providing healthcare for people with IDD consists of the same elements as providing healthcare for people without disabilities: Involving the patient Obtaining informatio n to identify a diagnosis Communicating treatment plans and preventive measures Resources Health Care for Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Toolkit http://vkc.mc.vanderbilt.edu/etoolkit / Developmental Disabilities information from the American Academy of Pediatrics http:// www.healthychildren.org/English/health -issues/conditions/developmental - disabilit ies/Pages/default.aspx Page 72 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed.

Safety - a property of any system, not just everyone \"working carefully\" 2. Effectiveness - the right technique/resources for the illness or event 3. Patient -centeredness - the patient plays an active role in making decisions 4. Timeliness - unintended waiting is a system defect 5. Efficiency - seeking to reduce the waste in supplies, equipment, space, capital, etc. 6. Equity - race, ethnicity, gender, and income do not prevent anyone from receiving care A Safe Culture (per Joint Commission) Expressed in the beliefs, attitudes and va lues of an organization's physicians/staff.

ANTICOAGULATION SAFETY Subject Matter Experts: SMH (341 -6792) Anticoagulation Therapy One of the Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals is to reduce the likelihood of harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulation therapy is used for the treatment of a number of conditions, the most common of which are atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and mechanical heart valve implantation. The key reason why ensuring the safe use of this class of medications is important is because anticoagulation medications have the highest potential to cause serious harm due to complex dosing, insufficient monitoring, and poor patient compliance Medications Used for Elements of Performance Both Strong Memorial and Highland Hospital have implemented and follow several key elements of performance to ensure compliance with th e National Patient Safety Goal. It is important for all clinical staff to be aware of these key elements: 1. Only individually packaged dosage forms, prefilled syringes, or premixed infusion bags of anticoagulation medications are used throughout the hospital. 2. Guidelines and protocols have been developed to assist with the initiation and maintenanc e of anticoagulant therapy. These guidelines and protocols are located on the Anticoagulation SharePoint intranet website at http://inside.mc.rochester.edu/sites/Anticoagulation/default.aspx These guidelines include information about baseline and ongoing laboratory tests required for anticoagulation therapies. .....continues..... Page 92 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. ANTICOAGULATION SAFETY (continued) 3. Food -drug inter actions with warfarin while an inpatient are not a significant concern since any diet available does not contain any more than the FDA -recommended, daily amount of Vitamin K. A URMC patient education brochure has been created that all patients receiving warfarin as well as any other coagulant should receive and have reviewed with them prior to discharge. These brochure s contain information about the management of potential food -drug interactions and other safety concerns that patients must be aware of afte r discharge. The brochure can be order ed from RR Donnelly, printed from a link within either the MAR or in the Anticoagulation Patient Education Record , or downloaded from the Anticoagulation SharePoint intranet site. Clinical Dietitians or Pharmacists ar e available for counseling patients regarding potential food -drug interactions upon request of either a provider or nurse. a. Whenever heparin, argatroban, lepirudin, or bivalirudin are administered intravenously via continuous infusion, Alaris infusion pumps are used to provide consistent and accurate dosing. Each of these medications is administered per nursing protocols when ordered from providers and requires a 2 RN double check to confirm accuracy of any dosing changes. b. Education is provi ded to hospital staff on anticoagulation therapy by pharmacists and physicians throughout the year via in -service presentations, newslett ers, and clinical grand rounds. Education is provided to families and patients during their admission and prior to their discharge. Patient and family education includes information on the importance of medication compliance, drug -food interactions, and the potential for adverse drug reactions and interactions. Patient education is provided by either nursing staff or phar macists utilizing the URMC educational brochures and is documented in the Anticoagulation Patient Education Record. It is important to remember: Anticoagulation therapy is used for the treatment of a number of conditions, the most common of which are atri al fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and mechanical heart valve implantation. The key reason why ensuring the safe use of this class of medications is important is because anticoagulation medications have the highest potential to caus e serious harm due to complex dosing, insufficient monitoring, and poor patient compliance. Only individually packaged dosage forms, prefilled syringes, or premixed infusion bags of anticoagulation medications are used throughout the hospital. Education i s provided to hospital staff on anticoagulation therapy by pharmacists and physicians throughout the year via in -service presentations, newsletters, and clinical grand rounds. Patient education is provided by either nursing staff or pharmacists utilizing t he URMC Warfarin Patient Education Brochure and is documented in eRecord.

CLINICAL ALARM MANAGEMENT (SMH specific) Subject Matter Expert: SMH For more information: http://sharepoint.mc.rochester.edu/sites/smhpolicy/Pol/Shared%20Documents/8.09%20Clinical%20 Alarms%20Management.pdf Clinical Alarm Management This policy has information that applies to all alarm -enabled patient -care medical devices identified as high priority, except when patients are monitored one -on-one by anesthesia provider in the operating room. For specific details about managing alarms, refer to the medical device specific policy/guideline, where available. Clinical Alarm systems are intended to alert caregivers of potential patient problems, and if not properly managed can compromise patient safety. Clinical alarm syste ms include a full spectrum of alarms that are designed to alert staff of a change in a patient's physiologic condition or a medical device equipment issue. Note: Clinical alarm management was identified as a priority by Strong Memorial Hospital (SMH) June 2014 and was added to the Quality Improvement Goals effective July 1, 2014. Definitions Alarm/Alert - an audible or visual signal intended to get someone's attention Primary Notification - Notification of device status from the alarm -enabled patient care medical device (e.g. ventilator, physiologic monitor, bed exit) Secondary Notification - Notification of device status from an alarm -enabled, patient care medical device other than the primary notification device (e.g. central monitor, pager, phone, nurse call system, hallway waveform screen). Alarm Management Middleware - Software that enables management and communication of alarm data between distributed clinical applications (patient monitoring systems, Nurse Call, secondary notification systems/devices ).

Nurses must customize alarm limits for patients based on patient's clinical condition. Nurses check individual alarm signals for accurate settings, proper operation and detectability Page 96 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. CODE OF e CONDUCT Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Robert Panzer, MD (273-4438 ) HH: Bilal Ahmed, MD (341-6770) Purpose To promote safe patient care through minimizing the distractions of eDevices (e.g. , IPhone, Blackberry, IPad, laptops) in the workplace while allowing for optimal use of electronic support in the care and treatment of patients and families. Clinical Pract ice Guideline: http:// intranet.urmc - sh.rochester.edu/policy/clinicalguidelines/code%20of%20econduct%20at%20urmc/code%2 0of%20econduct%20at%20urmc.pdf Minimal Standard Practice for Use of eDevices All devices including, but not limited to, Smart phones and cell phones, other than hospital - issued pager/urgent on -call communication devices , should be in \"silent\" mode whenever in a patient room or discussing patient information with the patient/family . Clinicians will refrain from using computers and eDevices at clinical work stations to conduct personal business. Use of computers and eDevices for necessary personal use is allowable in break room/break areas out of view of patients and families. (Please refer to t he SMH electronic device us e policy). Use of personal and business eDevices in the clinical setting for collection and transmission of protected health information will be through approved, secure networks in accordance with University of Rochester Medical Center HIPAA policies. Protected health information (PHI) transmitted through or to secured business eDevices will not be stored on personal eDevices. Optimal Practice for Use of eDevices Rounding : departments should create guidelines that provide clear delineation of roles for clinicians when rounding, including use of eDevices. The most senior rounding clinician (Round Leader) is in the primary role of communicating with the patient and teaching oth ers during rounding. As such, the leader should refrain from computer and/or eDevice use while in patient rooms with the exception of using eDevices during the course of teaching or explaining to the patient and family their diagnosis and plan of care. Clinicians should introduce the function and use of eDevices for medical management to patients and families upon admission and when first introducing themselves to the patient and family. Clinicians should have a separate eDevice or device with the technolo gy that allows for the separation of work -related and personal communication. Work issued phones/blackberries, computers and \"smart\" devices, etc., should not be used for personal use in patient care and clinical work areas. .....continues.....

CONTINUITY OF CARE THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Carla Integrated Delivery Network Strong Memorial and Highland hospitals are components of the University of Rochester Medical Center, an integrated delivery network of care that encompasses : the Hospitals Golisano Children's Hospital at Strong Visiting Nurse Service School of Nursing School of Medicine and Dentistry Medical Faculty Group James P. Wilmot Cancer Center The Highlands Eastman Dental Center URMC -affiliated primary care and specialty physicians The primary care and specialist physicians affiliated with the University of Rochester Medical Center also constitute part of our network of services. Standards As we provide care to patients across this continuum of care, it is important that we mainta in the highest standards of patient and family involvement and satisfaction. The following is a summary of the standards that have been developed to serve as a guideline to all faculty and staff providing care to patients within each component of the netwo rk, as well as for those patients moving from one level of care to another with continuing care plans: 1. Patients and families are introduced to each member of the treatment team as service is provided. The patient is informed of the name of the physician pr incipally responsible for their care and can easily arrange to communicate with the physician. 2. All patient/family continuity of care planning and implementation incorporates the patient's beliefs, capacities, and competencies, including decision making wit h respect to their care, discharge, and continuity planning as plans are made, changed, and implemented. 3. Patient/family questions and concerns about continuity of care are addressed rapidly and effectively by healthcare team members. The purpose of each tr ansfer of care and information about the site itself (services, providers, location, etc.) are fully explained. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 101 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. CONTINUITY OF CARE THROUGH INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION (continued) It is important to remember: It is important we maintain the highest standards of patient and family involvement and satisfaction; this is, in part, accomplished through clear communication across all services. Therefore: 1. Patients and families will be introduced to each member of the treatment team. 2. Patients and families will be involved in all decision making. 3. Patient and family concerns will be addressed rapidly and effectively.

DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Laura -4.pdf While in the Hospital A patient must consent to a DNR order before it may be issued except when consent is obtained from a surrogate (for patients without capacity); or the patient has previously consented to a DNR order, presently lacks the capacity to consent, and the order has been appropriately reviewed to confirm that the patient's medical condition has not changed. Review of DNR Orde rs The attending physician must review a hospital DNR order for a hospitalized patient at least once every seven days. For ALC (alternate level of care) patients, the order must be reviewed each time the patient is examined, but no less than every 60 days. Nonhospital DNR orders must be reviewed by the attending physician each time the patient is examined, whether in the hospital or not, but no less than every 90 days, provided that the review need not occur more than once every 7 days. Capacity to Consent to a DNR Order Every patient is deemed to have the capacity to consent to a DNR o rder unless the attending physician has determined the patient lacks capacity and a second physician has concurred. The cause and nature of the incapacity, as well as its extent and probable duration, must be determined by personal examination and documented in the patient's medical record. Information regarding permissible persons to give consent to the DNR order on behalf of a patient who lacks decision -making capac ity can also be found in SMH Policy 9.3.3 or HH Policy Manual, Do Not Resuscitate 4.4. Issuing a Nonhospital DNR Order May be issued for a hospitalized patient to take effect after hospitalization or may be issued by a physician in his or her office for a person who is not a patient in, or a resident of, a hospital. A nonhospital DNR order can only be issued on a special D OH form. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 103 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. DO NOT RESUSCITATE DNR (continued) When a DNR Status Dispute Arises SMH : the attending physician must inform the Administrator -on-Call. The AOC shall refer the dispute to the Ethics Review Committee who shall attempt to facilitate agreement among the interested persons. Highland : the health care team members should attempt to resolve any disputes regarding DNR status in collaboration with the patient and family. Should that effort fail, they have the option of consulting with the Ethics Committee which can be reached through the Social Work Services Office or the Nursing Supervisor on off -shifts Whenever a dispute is submitted for mediation, a DNR order may not be issued, or if already issued, shall be revoked until the di spute resolution process has concluded or 72 hours have elapsed, whichever is earlier. Patients or their surrogates may revoke their consent to a DNR order at any time.

END OF LIFE CARE Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Rev. Robin Franklin (275 -2187) End of Life Care There are many medical situations in which cure or recovery is not possible, and the care of patients at the end of their lives can be challenging. The priorities for end -of-life care are to: 1. Educate patients and families regarding medicall y appropriate options for care 2. Respect patients' and families' wishes and deci sions for care 3. Respect patients' and families' cultural and religious beliefs and traditions 4. Provide for patients' comfort including effective pain control and symptom management Beliefs and Practices Diverse c ultural and religious beliefs and practices may often be unfamiliar to staff but also may be an important determinant of what a patient will require of end -of-life care. There are a number of issues that might be important to a patient at the end of life, and it is important that staff be in convers ation with patients and their families about those issues. Available Services The following services are all available to patients, families, providers and caregivers to aid in the provision of care and/or discussion and resolution of issues that may ari se in the course of end -of- life care : Palliative Care Consultation Service (SMH/HH) Ethics Consultation Service (SMH), the Ethics Committee (HH) Chaplaincy Services (SMH/HH) Appropriate hospice services are also available for patients' care and support. Principles of Quality in End of Life Care Patients in end -of-life care will be provided the highest dignity and quality of care. Some of the principles that need to be followed are: The patient's wishes for medical care will be ascertained and honored to t he fullest extent possible. If the patient has not already done so, he or she will be offered the opportunity to designate a Healthcare Proxy in the event that the patient becomes unable to make decisions regarding his or her care. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 105 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. END OF LIFE CARE (continued) New York state law prescribes a formula for establishing a healthcare agent to make medical decisions in the event that the patient becomes unable to make medical decisions regarding his or her care and has not designated a Healthca re Proxy. All staff will respect the patient's and family's privacy and confidentiality as well as their cultural and religious beliefs and traditions throughout the process. To the fullest extent possible, family members and significant others will be all owed to remain with the patient and to participate in care if desired and if consistent with the wishes of the patient. A patient's pain, discomfort, and/or symptom management should always be addressed and never minimized or ignored. Patients should be offered psychological, social and spiritual interventions and support whether or not they choose to forgo active medical treatment. It is important to remember: Priorities for end -of-life care include education of patients and families regarding options for care and respect for patients' and families' wishes and decision for care. A Healthcare Proxy or agent may be designated to make medical decisions and only in the event that a patient is unable to make decisions regarding his or care. A patient's pain, discomfort, or symptom management should never be ignored or minimized regardless of the treatment being given. Diverse cultural and religious beliefs and traditions may influence what some patients and/or families desire for end -of-life care and those wi shes should be ascertained and honored to the fullest extent possible.

ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE HA NDOFF (ECHO) Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Anna Lambert (276 -3506), Michael S. Leonard, MD (276 -4113) HH: Sharon Communication is the process by which information is exchanged between individuals. It is the sender's responsibility to present a clear message. It is the receiver's responsibility to hear, interpret, evaluate and respond to the message. The Joint Commission estimates that nearly 70% of serious potential and actual adverse events are the result of communication failures. Approximately half of these communication failures occur at the time of handoff. A Hand -Off... Is the communication process that support s the transfer of care and responsibility for a patient from one clinician to another. Must occur at all transitions of care, such as change of shift, admission from the emergency department, and transfer to and fro m an intensive care unit. Must include the opportunity to ask questions. Involves a standardized process that enhances communication across hospital personnel, encourages teamwork, improves efficiency and promotes a culture of patient safety. In addition, a standardized handoff process is required by regulatory agencies including the Joint Commission and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). URMC's Minimum Standards for the Handoff Process 1. A handoff communication will occur between the sender and receiver for all transfers of patient care responsibility. URMC acknowledges that for some clinical workflows, the receiver is not always available or known at the time of physical transfer of the patient. In such scenarios, the rece iver will contact the sender to initiate the handoff communication. 2. The handoff process will include verbal communication, use of an on -screen clinical summary and/or a printable report to facilitate exchange of information between the sender and receiver. The Patient Story report(s) in eRecord provides key information that is concise, up to date and easy to read. The elements of this report link to more detailed clinical information. Patient Story reports will be visible to all clinical staff. .....continues ..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 107 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE HANDOFF (ECHO) continued 3. The handoff communication will occur with minimal interruptions. Services will identify designated handoff times. Handoffs should be interrupted for emergent and urgent issues only. Text paging rather than numeric paging should be utilized. The text page should, at minimum, include a phone number and the name of the person to contact. Preferably, a brief message summarizing the question or concern should be included to enable the receiver to appropriate ly triage/prioritize calls. 4. Handoffs will occur in an appropriate environment conducive to good communication. The sender and receiver should, when possible, have eRecord access at the time of the handoff communication. For handoffs that do not occur at th e bedside, a dedicated space that is quiet and out of patients' earshot should be available. 5. The sender of the handoff communication will have sufficient knowledge of the patient to effectively communicate the key and pertinent information to the receiver. The sender will have personally evaluated the patient prior to the handoff communication. The handoff communication will include, at minimum, the patient's historical data, medications, condition, care, treatment, services, and recent or anticipated chang es. 6. The primary service providers and nurses responsible for a patient will be clearly and accurately identified in the electronic medical record. eRecord provides the following fields to support this standard: Covering Provider = the first -call provider r esponsible for the patient Current Attending = the attending physician responsible for the patient Registered Nurse = the bedside nurse responsible for the patient It is important to remember: Minimal standards for the handoff process include: Handoff communication will occur between the sender and receiver for all transfers of patient care responsibility. Verbal communication, use of an on -screen clinical summary and/or a printable report. An environment conducive to good communication, and designated handoff times with minimal interruptions . eRecord access when possible at the time of handoff and if not occurring at the bedside, a quiet dedicated space out of patients' earshot. At a minimum, the patient's historical data, medications, condition, care, treatment, services, and recent or anticipated changes. Clear and accurate identity in the electronic medical record of the primary service providers and nurses responsible for a patient.

FALL PREVENTION Subject Matter Experts: SMH Robert -0929) Falls Falls are the largest single category of reported incidents in hospitals and the second most frequent cause of patient harm. The majority of hospital beds in the developed nations are occupied by older people, many of whom have been admitted because of mobility problems, falls, or injury from falls. According to the National Patient Safety Agency, falls in the acute care settin g that result in some injury range from 30% to 51%. Falls resulting in fracture range from 1% to 3% with reports of hip fracture ranging from 1.1% to 2%. Proximal femoral fractures caused by falls that occur in the hospital setting have been found to re sult in poorer health outcomes. Patient falls within the acute care setting can be the sign of worsening frailty, new medical conditions, or worsening status of a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Assessments Include But Are Not Limited To: Past history of falls Age 65 Perceptual problems; e.g., impaired hearing and/or sight, neuropathies, dizziness/vertigo Orthopedic conditions; e.g., arthritis, conditions; e.g., CVA, Parkinson's e.g., postural hypotension, sedation, extra -pyramidal effects Risk factors for injury Medication interactions \u2014more than 3 -4 medications Fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance Delirium, cognitive declin e, disorientation, wandering or Alzheimer's Disease Restraints Confusion/disorientation Poorly fitting footwear Unfamiliar environment Dysrhythmias Syncope Incontinence of bowel and/or bladde r Sleep disorders Fall Risk Screening During the admission process, a provider will make an initial assessment of fall and injury risks, based on medical comorbidities and H&P findings, and write any orders based on the assessment. Admitted adult inpatients will also have a Fall and Injury Pr evention Risk Assessment completed and documented upon admission, by a registered nurse utilizing the evidence - based fall risk screen. A multidisciplinary fall and injury prevention plan of care will be developed and implemented based on the nursing risk assessment and provider H&P. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 111 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FALL PREVENTION (continued) Frequency of Nursing Assessment Admitted adult patients are assessed for fall and injury risk and an individualized plan of care established based on patient -specific risk factors. This assessment and plan are to be completed and documented on the appropriate flow sheet/location in the EMR/patient record by a registered professional nurs e. Strong Memorial Hospital Within twenty -four hours of admission Daily Promptly after a patient fall Upon trans fer from one unit to a new unit Significant changes in patient status that may put the patient at higher risk of falling; for example: Post-operative Onset of confusion, delirium, change in mental status/ability to follow instructions Sudden change in mobility Plan of Care Includes interventions to minimize preventable falls and injuries Reviewed each shift and updated based upon shift assessment and patient's status Communicated with each nursing hand -off, including any recent revis ions Highland Hospital On admission Minimally every 24 hours Upon transfer to a unit With a change in condition (e.g., MI, PE, CVA, delirium, etc.) Post-operative Onset of confusion, delirium, change in mental status/ability to follow instructions Sudden change in mobility After a fall Plan of Care Includes interventions to minimize preventable falls and injuries Reviewed each shift and updated based upon shift assessment and patient's status Communicated with each nursing hand -off, including any recent revisions Patient Care Orders/Interventions Specific patient care orders/interventions should be based on the assessment findings and become part of an interdisciplinary safety plan for the patient. Orders/interventions include but are not limited to the following: Review medications for side effects/interventions and consider medication or dose changes. Implement strategies to prevent and treat early signs of acute onset delirium. Refer to Physical Therapy or Occupational Therapy, if indicated, to assist mobility, strength training, gait training or assistive devices. Refer to appropriate specialist/department to assist with managing hearing or visual deficits. .....continues..... Page 112 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FALL PREVENTION (continued) Discuss with interdisciplina ry team a fall safety plan including safety equipment that can be used to prevent injury; for example, hip protectors, helmets and enclosure beds (SMH only), floor mats, low beds, bed and chair alarms as appropriate. If a patient has sustained a fall, work with the patient to identify what they were doing at the time of the fall. Put a plan in place to address the cause of the fall if possible. Assess effectiveness of interventions/orders during interdisciplinary rounds. Include the patient and family in di scussion about the fall prevention plan and importance of safety interventions. Post-Fall Huddle (HH) include available multidisciplinary team members, to address the fall-related factors and additional preventative interventions Fall Risk Communication and Visual Cues Communication of Fall Risk Hand -off Report Unit Safety Briefings Admission and ongoing communication with patient and family Consider documentation on white board in patient room, to document patient ambulation needs Visual Cues/Signage \u2014Highland Hospital Limit use of door signage for patients who: Have experienced a fall during the current hospitalization Have been admitted due to a fall Are at high risk (Morse score of > 45) of falling and at risk of fall -related injury Fall Precautions and Patient and Family Education An order for falls precautions shall indicate the implementation of a multidisciplinary fall and injury prevention plan of care based on patient risk factors. All patients and families (as appropriate) are educated on fall and injury prevention interventions which are part of the patient's safety plan. The patient education is documented in the record. For patients who sustain a fall, the provider is notified and the patien t's plan of care is reviewed and updated as appropriate. Morse Fall Risk Screening Tool The fall risk screening tool utilized by the RN identifies patients at risk for falls based on the domains of: .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 113 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FALL PREVENTION (continued) Moderate to High Fall Risk Interventions Potential interventions to incorporate into the patient's safety care plan are: Fall Injury Prevention Assessment Injury risk assessment completed by RN. Fall Injury Prevention Interventions for >1 Risk Factor Injury prevention interventions to consider based on the patient's risk factor are: Hip protectors, helmets, canopy beds are available at SMH only. Additional Considerations Strategies to prevent and treat early signs of acute onset delirium should be co nsidered. Consider referrals to Physical or Occupational Therapy to assist patients with impaired mobility in need of strength training, gait training or need of assistive devices. Of note, this goes beyond basic ambulation. Refer appropriate specialist/department to assist with managing hearing or visual deficits. A post -fall shift event note located on the doc flow sheet should be completed if a patient sustained a fall. Obtaining a description of what the patient was doing at the time of the fall, how they felt, is critical in identifying additional modifiable risk factors. A provider should be contacted to assess and order diagnosis tic of additional safety interventions for a patient, especially if fracture or head bleed is suspected. .....continues..... Injury Prevention Interventions to consider based on the patient's risk factor are: Page 114 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. FALL PREVENTION (continued) For more information: SMH Policy Center for Patient Safety: http://www.patientsafety.va.gov/SafetyTopics/fallstoolkit/index.html Some online and published resources from the Joint Commission include: The National Guideline Clearinghouse (enter \"fall prevention\" in the search field) It is important to remember: According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injury, deaths, and hospital admissions for trauma among adults 65 years and over. Identifying patients at risk for falls provides the opportunity to institute measures to help prevent falls. Upon admission or with any change in condition, all patients should be assessed for risk of falling/injury and a safety plan created. Specific patient care orders/interventions should be based on the assessment findings and become part of an interdisciplinary safety plan for the patient.

HEALTH CARE PROXY Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Laura Wilson (275 -7279) HH: University of Rochester Medical Center -Strong and Highland hospitals must accept and comply with any properly authorized and executed health care proxy. The health care proxy is a form of an advance directive which appoints a health care representative/agent to make health care decisions when the patient is unable to make such decisi ons. The proxy document must identify the patient, the patient's agent, indicate that the patient intends to give health care decision -making authority to the agent, be signed and dated by the competent adult patient, and be signed by two adult witnesses who must include a statement attesting that the patient completed the proxy document willingly and free from duress. The proxy document may include any special instructions, limits of authority, expiration date, and may provide for the appointment of an al ternate representative. A patient may revoke his or her proxy document at any time by notifying the representative or the health care provider in writing, orally, or by any other act, even if the patient lacks capacity. Capacity The determination that a patient lacks capacity must be made by the attending physician and confirmed by a second physician. Special guidelines must be followed when the determination involves a psychiatric or developmentally disabled patient. If a nonphysician is informed of or p rovided with a revocation, he or she must immediately notify a physician. A health care proxy is not valid if completed by the patient who lacks capacity. Upon Admission On admission, each patient or a designee will be given a copy of the NYS DOH Proxy Law Summary Statement. If the patient has already completed a proxy document, the patient will provide a copy of the document for inclusion in his or her medical record. If the patient has not previously completed the document, she or he can be given assistance in completing the proxy. .....continues.....

INFORMATION FOR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Donna Library online http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/miner/ HH: Williams Health Sciences Library on line http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/libraries/williams/ Avoiding Malpractice Claims There is a growing trend in malpractice claims that targets \"failure to use available information to aid in the process of differential diagnosis\"1 as the basis of the claim. The increase in online health information is leading to a growing number of malpractice claims alleging that diagnosis and treatment outcomes could have been improved by using accessible information. SMH and HH providers can ask librarians at Miner, Bibby, and Williams Libraries to help them find information they need for clinical care. Click the \"Ask a Librarian\" link on the Miner Library, Bibby Library, or Williams Library home pages ~or~ Call 275 -2487 (Miner Library); 275 -5010 (Bibby Library at Eastman Institute for Oral Health); or 341 -6761 (Williams Libr ary at Highland Hospital). Expectations It is an INSTITUTIONAL EXPECTATION THAT PROVIDERS WILL USE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE WHEN CARING FOR PATIENTS. Patient care providers need to integrate information into their clinical practice and processes. They should (1) stay current with new evidence in their field, and (2) know how to find specific evidence for a particular patient. Resources Patient care providers should be familiar with the content and use of resources available in Miner Library online ( www.urmc.rochester.edu/miner/ ) at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC -SMH) or the Williams Health Sciences Library online at Highland (www.urmc.rochester.edu/libraries/williams/ ).

All medical equipment must be in good physical condition, and if appropriate, wired with a 3 - pronged chassis grounded plug. As appropriate, perform recommended equipment safety checks and affirm alarms are programmed and audible prior to medical equipment use. Inspection of All Medical Equipment All direct care providers should check for an \"Inspection\" sticker or an \"Approved for Use\" sticker on a piece of clinical equipment before placing it into use.

MEDICAL ORDERS FOR LIFE -SUSTAINING TREATMENT (MOLST) Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Timothy Quill, (273 -1154) HH: Bilal Ahmed , MD (341 -6776) or http://intranet.urmc -sh.rochester.edu/highland/Policy/HHpolicy/4 -5.pdf The MOLST Form The Medical Orders for Life -Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form is a document which provides guidance regarding the us e of life -sustaining therapies across settings (hospital, home, nursing home, and ambulance) throughout New York State. Note: The MOLST form does not necessarily mean the patient has chosen DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) or DNI (Do Not Intubate) status. One can learn about a patient's preferences about DNR, DNI or other potentially life -sustaining therapies by carefully reading the MOLST form in the medical record . Misconceptions About MOLST: 1. A MOLST form must be filled out even if the patient wants full CPR and no limitations. False! The MOLST generally designates limitations on treatment but not always. It is unclear what, if any, limitations there are on medical treatment without carefully reading the form. Full CPR is the def ault position if no form is present or if there is uncertainty about the patient's preferences. 2. The presence of a pink MOLST form means that the patient is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) or DNI (Do cu rrent about life -sustaining therapies. For example, some p atients might want full CPR if they experience an arrhythmia, but not want a feeding tube if they lose the ability to eat. In the event of a cardiac or pulmonary arrest, page 1 of the fo rm must be carefully reviewed for current DNR preference and page 2 for preferences about DNI and other potentially life -prolonging therapies. 3. A patient in the hospital who has the DNR or DNI sections of the MOLST form completed needs no other orders writt en to ensure these orders are activated. False! The MOLST can serve as an actionable medical order at the patient's home or in a nursing home. However, in the hospital , specific orders must be written and entered into the electronic medical record (EMR) to designate DNR or DNI after the MOLST is completed. If a patient arrives in the emergency department with a MOLST that designates DNR or DNI and there is no reason to d oubt that the form accurately expresses the patient's preferences, these preferences should be followed even if no formal order has yet to be written (and entered into the EMR). An order should then entered into the EMR as soon as possible. .....continues..... Page 124 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. MEDICAL ORDERS FOR LIFE -SUSTAINING TREATMENT ( continued ) 4. Any provider may issue a DNR order False! A DNR order can be entered only by the attending physician, personally or through a verbal order from the attending and then entered on the MOLST and the EMR by a resident or a mid -level provider. Such verbal orders must be cosigned on the MOLST by the attending physician within 24 hours. 5. All patients who are DNR should also be DNI. False! DNR applies to patients who experience acute cardiopulmonary arrest. DNI applies only to intubation for patients who experience respiratory failure, but are no t in full cardiac arrest. Some patients choose to be DNR, but not DNI. For example, a pat ient with chronic pulmonary disease might not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (and therefore be DNR), but might desire a trial of ventilatory support if they experience an acute respiratory problem (and therefore might not be DNI). On the other hand, al l patients who are DNI should generally also be DNR (since intubation is required for cardiopulmonary resuscitation). 6. The new MOLST can serve as a Healthcare Proxy or Living Will document. False! The MOLST form documents the patient's current preference s (or their surrogate's view of the patient's preferences if the patient is incapable of decision making) about potentially life -sustaining therapies. The MOLST form has a section on the bottom of page 1 to designate the presence or absence of Healthcare P roxy or Living Will documents, but these are separate documents that, if completed, should also be placed in the patient's medical record. A Healthcare Proxy documents the person(s) the patient would like to represent them in medical decision making in the future should they lose capacity to make their own decisions. A Living Will documents the patient's future preferences about treatment, but unlike the MOLST, it is only activated when and if patients lose capacity to make decisions for themselves in the f uture. Unlike the MOLST, neither the Living Will or the Healthcare Proxy documents are actionable medical orders. 7. The supplemental MOLST form is needed for a patient who lacks decision -making capacity. False! With the latest MOLST revision, only the main MOLST form is needed on all patients when a limitation of life -sustaining therapy is being designated, whether they have or lack decision -making capacity. The main MOLST suffices by itself in both situations, but must be backed up with the appropriate docu mentation in the medical rec ord, especially if the patient lacks capacity or is a minor. The MOLST checkli sts are available to guide the clinician in appropriate documentation. Facts to Remember 1. The MOLST form is consistent with NYS law and approved by th e NYSDOH for use at all nursing homes, hospitals, other medical facilities, at home or elsewhere in the community throughout New York state. DNR, DNI and other decisions about other potentially life -prolonging therapies can be made by patients with capacit y. If the patient has lost decision -making capacity and does not already have a MOLST form filled out, decisions about DNR, DNI and other potentially life -prolonging therapies can be made by designated health care proxies or by family members based on what is known about the patient's wishes. Specific guidelines and checklists (which are recommended but not legally required) for making these decisions are available at the following website: http://www.compassionandsupport.org/index.php/for_professionals/molst_training_center .....continues.....

MEDICAL ORDERS FOR LIFE -SUSTAINING TREATMENT ( continued ) 2. For patients admitted with a MOLST form, the admitting team should confirm that it still reflects the patient's preferences, sign and date the \"Review of the MOLST\" section. 3. The MOLST form does not necessarily mean that the patient has chosen DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) or DNI (Do Not Intubate) status. The form must b e carefully read to see if any limitations on treatment have been ordered. 4. A DNR order can be entered only by the attending physician, personally or through a verbal order entered by a resident or a mid -level provider and cosigned by the attending physician within 24 hours. 5. In the absence of a MOLST form, in an emergency it is assumed that the patient wants full cardiopulmonary resuscitation unless there is clear and convincing evidence otherwise. 6. The pink MOLST form should travel with the patient wherever he or she goes. A copy of the MOLST should stay in the patient's medical record.

MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION FOR CLINICAL STAFF Subject Matter Expert: SMH and HH: Donna Barnard (275 -2606) Dilg orders must be authenticated (verified, signed, dated and timed, electronically or in writing) within 48 hours of being given by a credentialed member of the provider team c aring for the patient. Documentation must be legible; if two different people cannot read hand -written notes, information is considered illegible. ALL medical record entries must be dated, timed, signed, and include your professional status. Post-op progress note is required immediately after surgery . Must include name of surgeon and assistants, procedure performed, description of findings, estimated blood loss, specimens removed, post-op diagnosis , and any unanticipated events or complications. All surgical/procedural patients (e.g., inpatients, ambulatory surgery patients and same - day admission patients, and other significant procedure * patients) must have a history and physical exam no more than 30 days prior to the surgery/procedure. The history and physical must be entered into the patient's record on or prior to admission, signed, dated, and timed by the responsible physician or othe r credentialed practitioner. If the history /physical is completed by someone ot her than an attending physician, it must be reviewed and countersi gned by an attending physician. *A significant procedure is defined as one that carries an operative or anesthe tic risk or requires highly trained personnel or special facilities or equipment. E .g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, endoscopy, super voltage radiation therapy, and debridement. Prior to surgery, a n update to the patient's condition must be docume nted in the medical record. A summary list is initiated for outpatients by the third visit .

MRI SAFETY (SMH specific) Subject Matter Experts: SMH: Julie Moeller (275-8656 ) What is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)? MRI is a diagnostic imaging test that uses a very large and strong magnet to produce images of the human body. The MRI systems used today vary in strength with the strongest scanners rated at 3 Tesla. Tesla magnets are strong enough to pick up a car. MRI scanners are ALWAYS on, even when there is no patient being imaged. Screening Process It is very important to properly screen all patients, visitors, and staff prior to entering Zone 3. This is to assure that all metallic objects such as jewelry, cell phones, hearing aids, scissors, etc. have been removed to prevent items from becoming pro jectile and to identify/prevent disruption of any metallic surgical implants. This process is achieved through written and verbal communication by a healthcare professional prior to any MRI scan. MRI Zones The MRI department/sites are divided into 4 zon es to ensure public and patient safety. Zone 1: includes all areas freely accessible to the general public, such as a main hallway. Zone 2: Are where patients are safely screened, change into metal free clothing and secure their belongings. Zone 3: Is the MRI control area. Access is strictly limited to MRI personnel and patients who have been screened and changed. Zone 4: Is the MRI MAGNET room that contains the VERY strong magnetic field. Access is strictly limited to MRI personnel and patients undergoin g their scan.

PAIN MANAGEMENT Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Timothy Quill , M.D. (273-1154); Kimberly HH: Laurie Ernest Patient Pain Patients have the right, consistent with applicable laws, to receive timely assessment and treatment of pain, including education about managing their pain. The SMH Pain Management Program and HH pain management policies/protocols assist providers in preventing and/or optimally managing pain in all patients, across all settings. In collaboration with patients and families, providers will work toward enhancing overall patient well-being and quality of life. The policies and protocols of the pain management program are characterized by: Timely pain assessments, interventions, and reassessments Consistency in care delivery Integration across the continuum Clear documentation Pain Management Modalities Pharmacologic (oral, intravenous, transdermal or via alternative routes) Interventional procedures (spinal or epidural analgesia, nerve blocks, etc. ) Nonpharmacologic, including (1) Distraction (music, pet therapy, etc.), (2) Massage or (3) Cool or warm compresses, etc. It is important to remember: Patients should be assessed for the presence/severity of pain at least every 4 hours; more frequently f ollowing the identification of pain, treatment of pain, or after a potentially painful procedure. Moderate to severe pain (above patient -specific threshold) should be further assessed by a nurse and if necessary, a mid -level provider or physician, with fol low-up management as appropriate. Once a treatment has been provided, a reassessment must be completed and documented in the patient's medical record within 30 -60 minutes. For patients from 6 - 12 years of age, cognitively impaired, unable to read or communicate in English, pain assessment using the FPR -S (FACES) scale is appropriate. The FLACC scale or other pain assessment tools should be used in children less than 6 years of age. A nurse must assess and verify the patient's symptoms prior to adminis tering pain treatment. Page 134 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. PATIENT SELF -DETERMINATION RIGHTS Subject Matter Experts: SMH : Laura Wilson (275 http://intranet.urmc -sh.rochester.edu/highland/Policy/HHpolicy/ Advance Directive New York State law requires that hospitals provide patients with a statement of the patient's right to make an advance directive. An advance directive is an oral or written expression, by a competent patient, of his or her preference regarding health care treatment. Includ es a preference as to whether to continue or refuse life -sustaining treatment, in the event that he or she becomes incapacitated. The law requires the hospital to legally honor enforceable advance directives made by competent patients. However, no patient shall be discriminated against based on whether he or she executed an advance directive. The health care proxy is an example of an advance directive, as is a patient's consent to a Do Not Resuscitate order See links above for more information on advance di rectives and DNRs. It is important to remember: Members of the health care team presented with a patient's written advance directive must notify the patient's attending physician and place a copy in the patient's medical record. If the patient revokes t he directive orally or in writing, it also must be noted in the patient's medical record and the attending physician must be notified. If an incapacitated patient has previously orally expressed a treatment preference, either before or during hospitalization, the attending physician must be notified of the patient's statement. If the statement(s) is clear and convincing and was made at a time when the patient was competent, the preference expressed may be relied upon by the patient's attending physician.

PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS Subject Matter Expert: SMH and HH : and HH: 341 -6853) Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Is Major Cause of Patient Injury, Mortality, Increased Cost Each year 160,000 -300,000 patients who undergo surgery develop an SSI SSIs are now the most common and very costly healthcare -associated infection (HAI) Each infection is estimated to increa se a hospital stay by an average of 7 -10 days and adds $10,000 to $25,500 extra charges. The total price tag for treating these infections is estimated to be $10 billion annually. Patients with an SSI have a 2 -11 times higher risk of death compared to oper ative patients without infection. Reducing SSIs is an important goal for all healthcare institutions. Up to 60% are estimated to be preventable by using evidence -based guidelines such as preoperative administration of antibiotics and eliminating pre -op sha ving of hair. Prophylactic Antibiotic Therapy Includes appropriate selection, timing , and discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Most prophylactic antibiotics must be initiated, but not necessarily completed, within one hour prior to surgical incision. Vancomycin and fluoroquinolones should be initiated within 2 hours prior to incision. Prophylactic antibiotics must be discontinued within 24 hrs. after surgery end time (or provider must document the appropriate reason if continued). CDC now re commends that they be stopped upon closure of the incision. Exception : cardiac surgery cases which can have antibiotics continued for up to 48 hours. There is a list of antibiotics that have been approved for use in various surgical specialties. Glucose C ontrol and Surgery Glucose control has been shown to prevent SSI in cardiac surgery. There is also growing evidence that hyperglycemia contributes to increased risk of infection in other surgical procedures as well. Maintain plasma glucose of <= 180 mg/dl (CDC recommends <=200) throughout the perioperative period for diabetics and nondiabetics . Normothermia Hypothermia has been associated with a number of adverse consequences, including: Increased susceptibility to infection Impaired coagulation and increased transfusion requirements , both of which can increase the risk of SSI. Post-anesthesia shivering and thermal discomfort .....continues..... Page 136 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS (continued) Temp control must begin in the pre -anesthesia area: Use passive insulation (warm blankets, socks, and head covering) Limit skin exposure during pre -op procedures If the patient is hypothermic on admission to pre -anesthesia, apply a forced -air warming system and increase passive insulation Keep room temperature around 70 degrees Intra-operative measures: Consider warming the operating room until the patient is prepped, draped Passive insulation (warm blankets, socks, and head covering) Institute active warming measures (e.g., a forced -air warming system) Warm fl uids for IV or irrigation Patient t emperature should be >=36C/98F thro ughout the perioperative period Post-anesthesia care is the same as pre -anesthesia measures Appropriate Hair Removal Ideally hair should not be removed. If it must be removed, then a razor must not be used. Exceptions: cases of traumatic head injury or scrotal surgery may have hair removed with a razor if deemed necessary by the surgeon If hair must be removed it should ideally occur outside the operating room. General Infection Prevention Measures Scrupulous hand hygiene and pre -op scrubbing is imperative Appropriate surgical attire worn during surgery Patient skin prep and draping of the operative site is carried out Removal of urinary catheters occurs no later than 2 4-48 hours after the end of surgery It is important to remember: Postoperative infection is a major cause of patient injury, mortality , and health care costs; each infection is estimated to increase a hospital stay by an average of 7 days and adds $10,000 -$25,500 extra charges per SSI. Proper prophylactic antibiotic therapy includes appropriate selection, timing and discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Hypothermia has been associated with a number of adverse consequences; temperature control must begin in the pre -anesthesia area. Ideally hair should not be removed. If it must be removed, then a razor must not be used unless traumatic head injury or scrotal surgery are involved and the surgeon deems it necessary. Hair removal if necessary shoul d occur outside the OR if at all possible.

Page 138 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. RADIATION SAFETY (continued ) Entering a laboratory posted with the radiation symbol, walking past a radioactive patient's room, or being near a department that uses x -rays is safe . If you have any questions about the health effects of working near radiati on, contact Radiation Safety and speak with a staff health physicist or (at HH) Radiation Safety Officer about your questions or concerns. It is important to remember: To minimize your exposure to radiation: Distance - The dose of radiation received is i nverse square proportional to the distance from the source. The person who stands close to the source is getting more radiation than the person who is 10 feet away. If a person doubles his or her distance from the radiation source, their radiation exposure is reduced by a factor of 4. Time - The dose of radiation received is directly proportional to time. The person who stands in the area for 30 minutes is getting more radiation than the person who is there for 5 minutes. Shielding - A lead apron is effective against some radiation , but not all! For example, lead will stop 95% of the radiation from an x -ray but only 5% of the radiation from the radioactive iodine given to some patients. Review safety guidelines before using radioactive materials.

SEPSIS MANAGEMENT Subject Matter Expert s: SMH : Mark Ott (275-5924) Sepsis A systemic, deleterious host response to infection leading to severe sepsis (acute organ dysfunction secondary to documented or suspected infection) and septic shock (severe sepsis plus hypotension not reversed with fluid resuscitation). Seve re sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affecting millions of people around the world each year, killing one in four (and often more), and increasing in incidence. Similar to polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke, the speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the initial hours after severe sepsis develops are likely to influence outcome.

SEPSIS MANAGEMENT (continued) Contraindications All ED/Inpatients are eligible for age -appropriate sepsis protocol unless: Patients for whom interventions in the protocol are clinically contra indicated. Patients with advanced directives in place at the time of care which preclude any protocol interventions. Patient or surrogate decision maker declined or is unwilling to consent to protocol interventions. Enrollees in IRB -approved clinical trial s for which interventions are inconsistent with established protocols. Newborns and infants in the NICU. All exclusions must clearly be documented in the patient record. It is important to remember: For patients with sepsis, any patient with a lactate >4 or SBP <90 despite 30mL/kg fluid, qualifies for the severe sepsis/septic shock protocol. Within 1 hour of suspecting severe sepsis/septic shock all patients must have: Blood cultures Lactate Level (Adults) IV Antibiotics If hypotensive or lactate 4 IVF bolus (30 ml/kg) Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 143 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. WRITE DOWN AND READ BACK FOR VERBAL ORDERS OR CRITICAL RESULTS Subject Matter Experts SMH: Ann Peterson Ottman (276-6065 ) HH: Sharon Johnson (341 -8399) Steps to Follow for Taking Verbal Orders Verbal orders can only be taken in emergencies. The receiver must be an RN, RPh, dietitian, or physical, occupational, speech language or respiratory therapist (in accordance with applicable scope of practice provisions for these practitioners) Verify 2 patient identifiers. The receiver of the information must write down the complete order or enter it into a computer. Read it back; simply repeating back is not sufficient . If you don't read it back, we are noncompliant! Receive confirmation that the order is correct. Steps to Follow for Crit ical Test Results Called to Unit/Department/Provider Verify 2 patient identifiers The receiver must write down the results or enter them directly into a computer. Read it back; simply repeating back is not sufficient . If you don't read it back, we are noncompliant! Receive confirmation from the person who conveyed the result. At SMH, the person accepting the results must communicate the results to the patient's care provider (if you are not the provider who needs to act on the results) and document notification of provider in eRecord. At Highland, critical test results are ONLY called to the provider, not the unit. It is important to remember: Follow the write down/read back process for telephone/verbal orders and critical test results: 1. Verify 2 patient identifiers. 2. Write down the complete information. 3. Read back the information. 4. Confirm that the information was correct. 5. Notify provider(s) of any critical test results, or implement order protocol, if appropriate.

RESTRAINT USE (HH specific - Patient Care Staff Only ) Subject Matter Expert : HH: Kristen Berns (341 -0929) Overview While Highland Hospital is considered a restraint free organization, there are rare occasions when restraint application is required as a last resort to maintain safety. There are strict regulatory standards on the use of restraints including length of application, written orders, face -to-face provider assessment, and care of the patient with proper documentation. Highland restraint policy and documentation revisions have been made to align with new regulatory guidelines. More detailed information about nursing responsibilities and documentation will follow in a separate module. What is a restraint? Physical restraint: Any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material or equipment that reduces the ability of a patient to move his or her arms, legs, body or head freely o All 4 side rails up to prevent patient from getting out of bed o Soft limb restraints o Twice as Tough restraints (ED and ICU only) o Synthetic leath er restraints (ED only) Chemical restraint: A drug or medication when it is used to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient freedom of movement and is not a standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition What is NOT a restraint? Hand mitts that are not tied down or restrictive All 4 side rails up to protect from falling off bed Safety Devices o Used for medical, diagnostic, or surgical procedures and standard practice for the procedure (safety belt in the OR) Supportive Devices o Used to meet the assessed needs of a patient who requires adaptive support (postural support, orthopedic appliances, lap belts, arm boards) Mechanical Protective Devices o Used for protective safety based on the assessed needs of the patient (helmets, tabletop chairs, bed rails) Shackles applied by correctional officers Patient Behaviors & Restraint Options Non Violent, Non Self -Destructive o Behaviors: pulling at lines/tubes, confusion, dementia, fall prevention o Restraint Options: Soft limb 2 point restraints a nd/or All 4 side rails up to prevent patient from getting out of bed o Restrain movement and prevent injuries .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 149 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. RESTRAINT USE (continued) Violent, Self -Destructive o Behaviors: Hitting, kicking, throwing items, self -injury o Restraint Options: Soft limb 4 point restraints Twice as Tough 4 point restraints (ED & ICU only) Synthetic leather 4 point restraints (ED only) o Reserved for managing an acute episode of violent or aggressive behavior, where the patient poses an imminent risk of harm to them selves or others Ordering Restraints In the event of an emergency an RN may initiate the use of restraints when the patient poses a threat to himself or another, A face-to-face assessment and order must be completed within one hour by a Physician, Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant. The Attending Physician must be notified as soon as possible by the ordering provider No PRN, verbal, or standing orders is permissible Order selected is based on patient behavior: o non-violent/non self -destructive, or o violent/self -destructive The patient must be kept under 1:1 supervision until provider assessment is done Renewing Restraints Non Violent, Non Self -Destructive restraint orders must be renewed every: o 24 hours for patients of all ages Violent, Self -Destructive restraint orders must be renewed every: o 4 hours for patients 18 years and older o 2 hours for patients between 9 years to 17 years o 1 hour for patients under 9 years Renewal of restraint orders require face -to-face assessment by Provider and documentation of findings to support continued use of restraints. If restraints are removed due to a change in behavior, a new order is required if necessary to reapply restraints. Remember... The least restrictive, safest, and most effective method of restraint should be used as a last resort for safety Consider restraint alternatives (such as diversional activities, room close to nurse's station, 1:1 supervision) Attempt to alleviate the cause (such as hypoxia, electrolyte imbalance, medicati ons, pain, need to void) Restraints are always attached using a quick -release buckle to a moveable part of the bed frame (not side rails, toilets, or commodes). Restraints must be released every 2 hours Hand mitts (not a restraint) require a Provider order which is good for 72 hours (excluding ICU) Page 150 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. SECURITY AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AT HIGHLAND (HH Specific) Subject Matter Expert: Joe Coon (341 -6833) Security Management Program General security concerns regarding patients, visitors, personnel, and property are addressed and maintained through frequent and in -depth foot and vehicle patrols by Security personnel. Appropriate identification of all patients, visitors, and staff is a chieved through wristbands for patients, name tags for employees, and visitor passes issued to visitors as deemed necessary. Access control of both the hospital buildings and sensitive areas within the hospital from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. is monitored thro ugh the Emergency Department post. During these hours, all visitors entering must register and be cleared by the particular area they want to visit. Before Security personnel allow access to a sensitive area (Pharmacy, Emergency, Family Maternity Center, or Cashier's Office), the person must be identified and given authorization to gain access to those areas. Safety Management Program Accident prevent ion and the provision of efficient, effective patient service go hand in hand. Employees at all levels have a primary responsibility for the safety of all patients, visitors, and members of the hospital staff by: Working together continuously to promote s afe work practices Observing all rules and regulations Consistently maintaining property and equipment in a safe working condition For these reasons, the hospital has established a safety management program and encourages the participation of all personnel. It is important to remember: To contact HH Security in an emergency, dial 1 -6666. Appropriate ID (HH photo ID) is required for all employees, patients, and visitors. Access to the building between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. is only through the Em ergency Department post. Sensitive areas of the building are designated as Pharmacy, Emergency, Family Maternity Center, and Cashier's Office Our Safety Management Program and Safety Committee continually perform, monitor and improve various processes whic h may impact employee, visitor, and patient safety.

MULTIDRUG -RESISTANT ORGANISMS Subject Matter Expert: and -forming bacteria that causes antibiotic -associated diarrhea. The extent of disease ranges from mild discomfort and diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and sometimes death. Symptoms of CDI are diarrhea, fever, lo ss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain/tenderness. It is diagnosed by stool culture or toxin testing. Patients at increased risk for CDI include those with antibiotic exposure, extended hospitalization, advanced age, weakened immune system, or serious underlying illness. C-diff can be transmitted in the health care setting by contaminated equipment (commodes, thermometers) and on the hands of health care workers who have touched a contaminated surface. Prevent C-diff Transmission Use contact precautions which consist of a private room, gowning and gloving by all who enter the room. Perform me ticulous hand hygiene . Some experts recomme nd soap and water rather than alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) since some studies have suggested that ABHR may not be as effective against spore -forming bacteria. Use d edicated patient equipment (such as thermometers and stethoscopes) and disinfect surfaces and equipment with an EPA -approved disinfectant with a C.diff kill claim. Patients with CDI are us ually treated with a 10 - to 14 -day course of oral antibiotics such as metronidazole (flagyl) or vancomycin. Families and visitors should perform hand hygiene before and after visiting, be encouraged to wear gowns and gloves to enter the patient's room, and to not have contact with other patients. Please refer to the CDI Testing Guidelines for more detailed information about when and how to test for C .diff. Extended Spectrum Beta -Lactamase Producing Organisms (ESBLs) These are enzymes that confer resistanc e to commonly used beta -lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and others. Infections caused by these organisms create additional challenges for health care providers i n finding effective treatments. These infections have also been asso ciated with poor outcomes. The prevalence of ESBLs depends on geography, and their occurrence is rapidly increasing. .....continues..... Page 152 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. MULTIDRUG -RESISTANT ORGANISMS (continued) Organisms Most Commonly Found to Produce the ability to break down beta -lactam antibiotics and are able to transfer their resistant enzymes to other microorganisms. They are often f ound in the bowel movements of people who are infected or colonized. People become infected when they touch equipment or surfaces that are contaminated with stool and then touch their mouth and swallow the germ. ESBLs can also be spread when the germ is on the hands of the patient or the health care worker. Scrupulous hand hygiene should be used to prevent the transmission of ESBLs. Contact isolation precautions are used for patients with ESBL infections. Risk Factors for Acquiring an ESBL Recent stay in an ICU Weakened immune system Recent transplant surgery Premature birth Frequent/long -term antibiotic therapy Having an indwelling urinary catheter present Recent surgical procedures Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus are common bacteria found on someone's skin or in their nose. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is Staphylococcus aureus that has become resistant to treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin or methicillin. MRSA occurs most frequently among patients in health care facilities who have weakened immune systems, experienced prolonged antibiotic therapy, or who have undergone invasive medical procedures. MRSA can be harmless unless it invades tissue through a wound or a break in the skin and can then cause serious and potentially life -threatening illness such as bloodstream infections, surgical -site infections or pneumonia. Sources of transmission The hands of health care workers or contact with contaminated surfaces and medical equipment can be primary sources of transmission of MRSA and other drug-resistant organisms in the health care setting. Hands may become contaminated with MRSA by contact with infected or colonized patients. Prevent t he spread of MRSA Use meticulous hand hygiene, and sanitiz e equipment which goes from patient to patient (e.g., thermometers, stethoscopes, pulse oximeters, etc.). Sanitizing must be done with a hospital -approved disinfectant before equipment is used on the next patient. .....continues..... Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Page 153 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. MULTIDRUG -RESISTANT ORGANISMS (continued) Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) Enteroccocci are bacteria normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract; these bacteria can sometimes cause infection. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is often used to treat infections caused by Enterococci. In some instances, Enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin -resistant Enterococci (VRE). VRE infections occur most frequently in those who are hospitalized, especially if they have been in the hospital a long time or if they have compromised immune systems, open wounds, catheters, or drainage tubes. VRE most commonly infects the skin, urinary tract, and blood stream but can occur anywhere in the body. VRE ca n also be present without causing infection; this is known as colonization. It is important to remember: C-diff Spore-forming bacteria that cause antibiotic -associated diarrhea. Transmission can be prevented by: Using contact precautions : a private room, gowning, and gloving by all who enter the room. Meticulous hand hygiene. Dedicated patient equipment (such as thermometers and stethoscopes) and disinfection of surfaces and equipment with a bleach -containing product in the inpatient setti ng (not necessary to use in NICU, OR, OB/Gyn or outpatient setting). Extended -spectrum beta -lactamases (ESBLs) Enzymes that confer resistance to commonly used beta -lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and others. Transmission can be prevented by: Scrupulous hand hygiene. Using contact isolation precautions : a private room, gown and gloves when entering the room and then removing and discarding them when exiting. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) A strain of Staphyloc occus aureus resistant to treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin or methicillin. The spread of MRSA can be prevented by dedicated patient equipment (e.g. thermometers and stethoscopes ). If the equipment must be shared, then cleaning must be done with hospital -approved disinfectant before it is moved to the next patient. Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) Enteroccocci are bacteria normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract) that ha ve become resistant to the antibi otic, vancomycin. The spread of VRE can be prevented by horizontal prevention strategies such as: Meticulous hand hygiene Sanitizing equipment which goes from patient to patient with a hospital approved disinfectant. Standard precautions \u2014contact isolation is no longer required. Page 154 Highland Hospital Mandatory In -Service Manual 201 6 Compiled and edited by UR Organizational Development & Staff Diversity and HH Dept. of Ed. PREVENTION OF CENTRAL LINE ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS (CLABSIs) Subject Matter Expert: SMH and HH -6853) Deaths/Costs Due to CLABSIs An estimated 14,000 - 28,000 deaths occur annually due to CLABSIs. Bloodstream infections are often serious enough to cause an extended hospital stay as well as increased cost and risk of mortality. The estimated cost per bloodstream infection ranges from $4,000 to $40,000. CLABSIs can be prevented through proper placement and management of a central line. Causes/Prevention of CLABSIs CLABSIs can occur due to disruption of the integrity of the skin. Infection may then spread to the bloodstream. Sepsis can lead to hemodynamic changes, organ dysfunction, and sometimes death. Prevention of CLABSI focuses on: insertion, maintenance and removal of the line. Attachment and migration of bacteria to the line can occur at the time of insertion or in the days following insertion. Cutaneous contamination is the most common source of catheter infection when catheters are in place for <10 days. Aseptic technique mus t be maintained during insertion and dressing changes. Maximal barrier precautions are used: face mask, cap, sterile gloves, sterile gown, full body sterile drape for patient. The necessity of the line must be regularly assessed. No line = No CLABSI . Inserting Central Line Bundle Scrupulous hand hygiene. Maximal sterile drape (covers patient head to toe). Full barrier precautions when inserting (sterile gown and gloves, head cover and face mask). Skin prepped with at least 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) using back and forth strokes for 30 seconds (unless contraindicated ; e.g., neonates with low birth weight, allergy, etc.) and allowed to air dry for same amount of time. If any of the above elements are missing or done incorrectly , the HCW observing the insertion should \"stop the line.\" Apply CHG -impregnated sponge dressing (Biopatch) on all central and arterial lines. Place alcohol caps on all needleless access devices and tubing ports . Avoid femoral insertion site in adults if obese. Assess the need for the central line daily. Discontinue central line ASAP if no longer indicated (requires provider order). Maintaining Central Line Bundle Scrupulous hand hygiene before and after all contact including before medication administration and site assessment. Perform dressing change and site care using aseptic technique. .....continues.....

PREVENTION OF CENTRAL LINE ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS (continued) Assess site and document every 24 hrs. and prn. Scrub needleless access device with at least 2% CHG (unless contraindicated) for 15 seconds using back and forth strokes and allowing site to dry equal amount of time if alcohol cap is not present or if accessing the line multiple times during a single -access episode. Apply transparent semipermeable dressing over insertion site and change dressing every 7 days and prn. Note: loose or soiled dressings must be replaced and not reinforced. Apply gauze dressing rather than semipermeable dressing over insertion site if there is bleeding/oozing at the site, and then change dressing within 48 hrs; change immediately if moist or soiled. Bathe all patients over 2 months of age with a CHG preparati on on a daily basis. Replace dressing if damp, loose or visibly soiled. Perform site care as described above each time dressing is replaced. Change tubing at least every 96 hrs. Change IV fluids and all access devices with tubing change, including stopcoc ks, extension tubing, blood -saving devices, and needleless access devices. Flush all lumens per policy to maintain patency. Blood Cultures Cultures may be drawn from the central line when a central line infection is suspected or the source of the bloodst ream infection is unknown. Lines in place <5 days are infrequently infected and therefore should not routinely be cultured. If there is another source suspected (e.g., intra -abdominal, cellulitis, pneumonia, wound, UTI), blood cultures should be drawn from a peripheral site. In rare instances where access for peripheral blood draw is limited, one set may be drawn from the line and the other by percutaneous venipuncture. Note : An order from the attending physician must be obtained before drawing a blood cul ture from the central line. Please refer to the Blood Culture Guidelines for additional details. Drawing Blood Cultures from Central Lines Scrupulous hand hygiene. If needleless access device is attached to catheter hub, blood samples for culturing should be obtained through this device. Use vigorous friction to scrub the hub or needleless access device with alcohol for at least 10-15 seconds (or 10 times) and allow to dry at least 30 seconds every time you make or break connection. Obtain sample pe r policy. Flush central line per nursing policy. NOTE: Blood culture by peripheral venipuncture is always preferred except when the line is suspected as the source of infection. If the central line is suspected or unknown source, then draw one peripheral venipuncture and one sample from each port of device. .....continues.....

PREVENTION OF CENTRAL LINE ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS (continued) Replacing C -VADS Lines should be removed as soon as possible Routine C -VAD guidewire exchange or site rotation is not recommended.* Guidewire exchange is acceptable for replacing a malfunctioning catheter or downsizing a pulmonary artery catheter to a central venous catheter. Patients who clearly have a CLABSI sho uld not undergo a guidewire exchange. Selected patients with suspected blood stream infections and limited venous access may have their catheter exchanged over a guidewire and the catheter tip should be cultured. Before handling the new catheter, switch t o a new set of sterile gloves. *Eyer, et. al. Crit. Care Med. 1990;18 (10): 1073 -9 It is important to remember: CLABSIs are often serious enough to cause an extension of the hospital stay as well as increased risk of morbidity and mortality. CLABSIs can be prevented by proper placement and management of the line. CLABSIs can occur as a result of disruption of the integrity of the skin leading to an infection that may then spread to the bloodstream. Prevention of CLABSIs requires a focus on proper insertio n and maintenance of the line as well as removal as soon as possible .
