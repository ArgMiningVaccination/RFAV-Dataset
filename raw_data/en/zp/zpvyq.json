Dilution and Preparation Instructions Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Vial with Purple Cap - Verify that the vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has a purple plastic cap. Some vials also may have a purple label border. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Vial with Purple Cap - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Vial with Purple Cap - Equalize vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial by withdrawing 1.8 mL air into the empty diluent syringe. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Vial with Purple Cap - Administration Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The vaccine will be an off-white suspension. During the visual inspection, Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly. After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with purple caps contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract 6 doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 6 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Contraindications Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (see [Full EUA Prescribing Information](#fulleuaprescribing)). Warnings Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Monitor Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html)). Myocarditis and Pericarditis Postmarketing data with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within the period 0 through 7 days following the second dose of the primary series. The observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html)). Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Limitation of Effectiveness Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. Adverse Reactions Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that have been reported in clinical trials include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, malaise, lymphadenopathy, decreased appetite, rash, and pain in extremity (see [Full EUA Prescribing Information](#fulleuaprescribing)). Adverse Reactions Identified in Post Authorization Experience Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema), diarrhea, vomiting, pain in extremity (arm), syncope, and dizziness have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Post Authorization Experience Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Primary Series The safety of the primary series Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 43,448 participants [21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2; 21,728 placebo] in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 adolescents are 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 and 1,129 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). In Study 2, all participants 12 through 15 years of age, and 16 years of age and older in the reactogenicity subset, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Tables 1 through 6 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine and placebo. Participants 16 Years of Age and Older At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 [18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) and 18,785 placebo] participants 16 years of age or older had been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years of age and older enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native.

(37.7) 161 (9.8) From an independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), in 99 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas) 97\u00b18 months previously who received a third vaccine dose, the adverse event profile was similar to that after the second dose and no grade 3 or grade 4 events were reported in recipients who were followed for 1 month following post Dose 3. Unsolicited Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 through 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7,960, placebo = 7,934), serious adverse events were reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events In Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 through 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by 4 participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Adolescents 12 Through 15 Years of Age In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of March 13, 2021, 2,260 adolescents (1,131 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA); 1,129 placebo) were 12 through 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 (660 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 648 placebo) adolescents have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among adolescents who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the adolescents who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female, 85.9% were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 1 was 2.4 days (range 1 to 10 days), for redness 2.4 days (range 1 to 16 days), and for swelling 1.9 days (range 1 to 5 days) for adolescents in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine| Dose 1 N n Redness [\u00b6](#footnote-41) Any (>2 cm) 65 (5.8) 12 (1.1) 55 (5.0) 10 (0.9) Mild 44 (3.9) 11 (1.0) 29 (2.6) 8 (0.7) Moderate 20 (1.8) 1 (0.1) 26 (2.4) 2 (0.2) Severe 1 (0.1) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Swelling [\u00b6](#footnote-41) Any (>2 cm) 78 (6.9) 11 (1.0) 54 (4.9) 6 (0.6) Mild 55 (4.9) 9 (0.8) 36 (3.3) 4 (0.4) Moderate 23 (2.0) 2 (0.2) 18 (1.6) 2 (0.2) Severe 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Pain at the injection site [#](#footnote-42) Any 971 (86.2) 263 (23.3) 866 (78.9) 193 (17.9) Mild 467 (41.4) 227 (20.1) 466 (42.5) 164 (15.2) Moderate 493 (43.7) 36 (3.2) 393 (35.8) 29 (2.7) Severe 11 (1.0) 0 (0.0) 7 (0.6) 0 (0.0) |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine| Dose 1 N n Fever 38.0\u00b0C 114 (10.1) 12 (1.1) 215 (19.6) 7 (0.6) 38.0\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C 74 (6.6) 8 (0.7) 107 (9.8) 5 (0.5) >38.4\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 29 (2.6) 2 (0.2) 83 (7.6) 1 (0.1) >38.9\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C 10 (0.9) 2 (0.2) 25 (2.3) 1 (0.1) >40.0\u00b0C 1 (0.1) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Fatigue [\u00b6](#footnote-47) Any 677 (60.1) 457 (40.6) 726 (66.2) 264 (24.5) Mild 278 (24.7) 250 (22.2) 232 (21.1) 133 (12.3) Moderate 384 (34.1) 199 (17.7) 468 (42.7) 127 (11.8) Severe 15 (1.3) 8 (0.7) 26 (2.4) 4 (0.4) Headache [\u00b6](#footnote-47) Any 623 (55.3) 396 (35.1) 708 (64.5) 263 (24.4) Mild 361 (32.0) 256 (22.7) 302 (27.5) 169 (15.7) Moderate 251 (22.3) 131 (11.6) 384 (35.0) 93 (8.6) Severe 11 (1.0) 9 (0.8) 22 (2.0) 1 (0.1) Chills [\u00b6](#footnote-47) Any 311 (27.6) 109 (9.7) 455 (41.5) 73 (6.8) Mild 195 (17.3) 82 (7.3) 221 (20.1) 52 (4.8) Moderate 111 (9.8) 25 (2.2) 214 (19.5) 21 (1.9) Severe 5 (0.4) 2 (0.2) 20 (1.8) 0 (0.0) Vomiting [#](#footnote-48) Any 31 (2.8) 10 (0.9) 29 (2.6) 12 (1.1) Mild 30 (2.7) 8 (0.7) 25 (2.3) 11 (1.0) Moderate 0 (0.0) 2 (0.2) 4 (0.4) 1 (0.1) Severe 1 (0.1) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Diarrhea [\u00de](#footnote-49) Any 90 (8.0) 82 (7.3) 65 (5.9) 43 (4.0) Mild 77 (6.8) 72 (6.4) 59 (5.4) 38 (3.5) Moderate 13 (1.2) 10 (0.9) 6 (0.5) 5 (0.5) Severe 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) New or worsened muscle pain [\u00b6](#footnote-47) Any 272 (24.1) 148 (13.1) 355 (32.4) 90 (8.3) Mild 125 (11.1) 88 (7.8) 152 (13.9) 51 (4.7) Moderate 145 (12.9) 60 (5.3) 197 (18.0) 37 (3.4) Severe 2 (0.2) 0 (0.0) 6 (0.5) 2 (0.2) New or worsened joint pain [\u00b6](#footnote-47) Any 109 (9.7) 77 (6.8) 173 (15.8) 51 (4.7) Mild 66 (5.9) 50 (4.4) 91 (8.3) 30 (2.8) Moderate 42 (3.7) 27 (2.4) 78 (7.1) 21 (1.9) Severe 1 (0.1) 0 (0.0) 4 (0.4) 0 (0.0) Use of antipyretic or pain medication [\u00df](#footnote-50) 413 (36.6) 111 (9.8) 557 (50.8) 95 (8.8) Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 2 in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo), 98.3% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 5.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy plausibly related to the study intervention were imbalanced, with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (7) vs. the placebo group (1). There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, vomiting Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions rash, pruritus, and Nervous System Disorders: syncope, dizziness See [Overall Safety Summary (Section 6)](#S6) for additional information.

Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (modRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on 4 occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or postnatal development were reported in the study. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for use in individuals 6 months through 17 years of age. This authorization is based on safety and effectiveness data in this age group and adults. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is not authorized for use in individuals younger than 6 months of age. Clinical studies of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine include participants 65 years of age and older who received the primary series and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see [Overall Safety Summary (6.1)](#_RefS6.1) and [Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18.1)](#S18.1)]. Of the total number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients in Study 2 (N=20,033), 21.4% (n=4,294) were 65 years of age and older and 4.3% (n=860) were 75 years of age and older. From an independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been evaluated in persons that received solid organ transplants. The administration of a third dose of vaccine appears to be only moderately effective in increasing potentially protective antibody titers. Patients should still be counselled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated as appropriate for their health status. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is supplied as a frozen suspension in multiple dose vials with purple caps; each vial must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use to form the vaccine. Each 0.3 mL dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine supplied in multiple dose vials with purple caps contains 30 mcg of a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Each 0.3 mL dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine supplied in multiple dose vials with purple caps also includes the following ingredients: lipids (0.43 mg ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 0.05 mg 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 0.09 mg 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 0.2 mg cholesterol), 0.01 mg potassium chloride, 0.01 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.36 mg sodium chloride, 0.07 mg dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and 6 mg sucrose. The diluent (sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) contributes an additional 2.16 mg sodium chloride per dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain preservative. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Table 7 presents the specific demographic characteristics in the studied population.

Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), a single arm study has been conducted in 101 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas) 97\u00b18 months previously. A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered to 99 of these individuals approximately 2 months after they had received a second dose. Among the 59 patients who had been seronegative before the third dose, 26 (44%) were seropositive at 4 weeks after the third dose. All 40 patients who had been seropositive before the third dose were still seropositive 4 weeks later. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 68% (67 of 99 patients) 4 weeks after the third dose. The information in this section applies to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that is supplied in multiple dose vials with a purple cap. These multiple dose vials are supplied in a carton containing 25 multiple dose vials (NDC 59267-1000-3) or 195 multiple dose vials (NDC 59267-1000-2). After dilution, 1 vial contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in this Full EUA Prescribing Information regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GET ANY OF THESE VACCINES WHAT IS COVID-19? COVID-19 disease is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness leading to death. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle body new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea. HOW ARE COMIRNATY (COVID-19 VACCINE, mRNA), THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, AND THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, BIVALENT RELATED? COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, when prepared according to their respective instructions for use, can be used interchangeably. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent is made in the same way as COMIRNATY and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine but it also contains an Omicron component to help prevent COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. For more information on EUA, see the \" [What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?](#whatisaneua)\" section at the end of this Fact Sheet.

In clinical trials, approximately 23,000 individuals 12 years of age and older have received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Millions of individuals have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under EUA since December 11, 2020. In a clinical trial, approximately 300 individuals greater than 55 years of age received one dose of a bivalent vaccine that differs from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent in that it contains a different Omicron component. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THESE VACCINES? COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine have been shown to prevent COVID-19. FDA has authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent to provide better protection against COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The duration of protection against COVID-19 is currently unknown. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THESE VACCINES? There is a remote chance that these vaccines could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, more commonly in adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: Side effects that have been reported with these vaccines include: These may not be all the possible side effects of these vaccines. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. The possible side effects of these vaccines are still being studied. WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS?

WHERE WILL MY VACCINATION INFORMATION BE RECORDED? The vaccination provider may include your vaccination information in your state/local jurisdiction's Immunization Information System (IIS) or other designated system. For more information about IISs visit: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html). CAN I BE CHARGED AN ADMINISTRATION FEE FOR RECEIPT OF THESE COVID-19 VACCINES? No. At this time, the provider cannot charge you for a vaccine dose and you cannot be charged an out-of-pocket vaccine administration fee or any other fee if only receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. However, vaccination providers may seek appropriate reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID-19 vaccine administration fees for the vaccine recipient (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, Health Resources & Services Administration [HRSA] COVID-19 Uninsured Program for non-insured recipients). WHERE CAN I REPORT CASES OF SUSPECTED FRAUD? Individuals becoming aware of any potential violations of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS or [https://TIPS.HHS.GOV](https://TIPS.HHS.GOV). WHAT IS THE COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM? The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for costs of medical care and other specific expenses of certain people who have been seriously injured by certain medicines or vaccines, including these vaccines. Generally, a claim must be submitted to the CICP within one (1) year from the date of receiving the vaccine. To learn more about this program, visit [http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/](http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/) or call 1-855-266-2427. [WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)?] An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. A product authorized for emergency use has not undergone the same type of review by FDA as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.
