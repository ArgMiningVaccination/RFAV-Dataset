A new lab partnership will help drive omega-3s research in the Asia Pacific region, according to OmegaQuant, a firm that has developed a simple blood test to measure levels of these important nutrients. A Tasmanian dairy which is said to have launched the world's first yogurt made from milk containing naturally occurring omega-3 is seeing sales growing by 30% year-on-year \u2014 and it is now targeting exports to Asia. China's omega-3 market appears to be at a tipping point, with slowly rising consumer awareness being buoyed by both the ingredient's sports nutrition potential and growing opportunities for personalised nutrition. The market for functional foods containing omega-3 is ripe for innovation in Asia and the Middle East, with one start-up claiming it can provide 250mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in 30g of chocolate. Korean adults are falling far short of recommended daily intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a new study based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) has revealed. In his final address to the omega-3 sector as a whole, outgoing GOED executive director Adam Ismail said the industry has unlimited potential, which it can reach only if it bands together to control its message and support the ingredients' health benefits... In a relentless pursuit of 'scale', Aker BioMarine has now become the world's undisputed leader in krill oil supply. The purpose is not mere aggrandizement, but rather, to have the necessary wherewithal to grow the category with science... After more than 10 years guiding the most successful organization of its type within the supplements industry, Adam Ismail has announced he will step down as the executive director of GOED at the end of February. The omega-3 fatty acid DHA and its metabolites, known as docosanoids, could help to pre-condition vision cells to survive when injured, suggest researchers who liken the effect to a form of vaccine or immunity. Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could alleviate acute pancreatitis via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but higher doses could have the opposite effect among people with hyperlipidaemia, say researchers in South Korea. The Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED) and William Reed, publishers of NutraIngredients, are pleased to announce a collaboration to expand the number of global touchpoints for the omega-3 community. The Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED) continues to commission key studies to support the quality and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids, with recent meta-analyses of the health benefits starting to impact policy and regulatory conversations. The Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED) has developed \"GOED Best-Practice Guidelines on Oxidation Control\" to help the industry to avoid oxidation issues and produce the highest quality products available. There is much room to improve omega-3 fish oil's green credentials for environmental, health and economic reasons as firms seek to shift from energy intensive extraction methods and organic solvent use. New omega-3 laser testing technology in New Zealand has showed that 11 widely-available supplements were in line with their label claims, \"which should give consumers reassurance regarding the quality of the oil in the capsules.\" Omega-3 supplementation helped lessen chemotherapy-induced mucosal toxicities such and diarrhoea, and provided liver protection for oesophageal cancer patients, revealed a Japanese study. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found to have a higher deficiency of essential fatty acids despite consuming similar amounts of omega-3 as those without the condition, research from Taiwan suggests. \"We are building it while we're flying it,\" says William Harris, the distinguished American omega-3 researcher, of a mapping project to find out the true level of omega-3s in Australians' blood, at a time when three-quarters of the population are believed...
