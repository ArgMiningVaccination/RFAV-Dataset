My daughter had a facial paralysis for a week. Her regular doctor said there were not much to do so just wait to see if she was going to get better. We were devastated. I didn't want to \"wait and see\" so I found this place on Google and called the same day. They said we could just walk-in and told me the cost for the treatment (I asked) and it was nice to know how much it could cost before. The price is very reasonable. We walked in and there was no waiting. The room was filled with the aroma from the herbal tea they make all day and we found it was comforting. The doctor was kind and looked very genuine. He checked my daughter's face, pulse and tong and immediately said \" Don't worry, she is going to be healed 100% within a month\" . What a relief to just hear that after the Western medicine doctor said it was too late to give their treatment! Now she has been getting the acupuncture sessions several times and taking the personalized herbal tea over a week, she is almost healed completely! The acupuncturist is a sweet lady. She is very gentle, knowledgeable and quick so my daughter feels comfortable. She even played relaxing music to ease off the tension my daughter had since it was her first experience with acupuncture. The office is very small but they have the biggest hearts so I am leaving the review here so more people can find this place. - 11/20/2020 I used to have severe edema, after I have the tea, I get better than before. It really works!! - 12/17/2017 I was struggling with infertility for many years and wanted to find something that worked. Of course, I would strongly recommend seeing a Western medical doctor first to rule out any medical issues. I found out about Dr. Gao through word of mouth. I learned that not only did I need Western medicine but I also needed Eastern medicine as well. Dr. Gao can prescribe herbs that can improve fertility because that's what he specializes in. You can see a wall of photos of babies from his clients. You have to come once a week for Dr. Gao to prescribe you an herbal recipe that will last you for a week. Your appointments have to be consistent. On top of paying for your consultation, they also have an optional $10 charge to cook the herbs for you. Save yourself the hassle and pay the fee. If you see him in the morning, the herbal soup will be ready later in the day. If you see him by the end of the day, the herbal soup will be ready the next day. The herbal soup wasn't meant to taste great just so you know. It takes at least 3 months before your chi can reach it's maximum potential. Please keep in mind that these herbs are supplemental. It is not a guarantee but there are success stories. You have to be patient. Do not expect overnight success. I saw Dr. Gao for several months, and I was able to conceive naturally within a year (after receiving proper treatment from a Western doctor). Dr. Gao only speaks Mandarin, but his receptionist Tracy is fluent in English and Mandarin. She is extremely helpful, friendly, and can translate everything for you. - 12/23/2016 I went to this clinic for infertility. Because my aunt recommend me to see Dr Gao. Dr Gao said I should drink the herb tea for couple months to strengthen my kidney Yin. I followed his advise and took the tea everyday. It tastes so bad... After 4 months non stop herb treatment, I finally got pregnant !!! Now my baby girl is 3 months, so healthy and lovely! Thank you Dr Gao! I will definitely recommend my friends to see you in the future. - 7/4/2017 Really good doctor for fertility and female issues. He charges a lot more than the others but it works and he is super experienced. They are also open on the weekends. - 3/26/2016First to Review Tracy, the assistant is really really sweet, in fact they all have great bed side manners. I took my mom to see the acupuncturist because she was having a lot of neck,shoulder, arm and hand pain on left side. She has cervical stenosis and I thought by having acupuncture done, this will alleviate some of the pain. We chose this place because it was the only one that was close to where we were eating and it was open. It was $50 for the session and $20 for cupping. My mom had 16 needles and all seem fine but after 10 min, my mom started having pain from the needles on her left arm. I told Tracy and she said if my mom can take the pain a little longer ... I had to call her right away and told her to pull them out because it was unbearable. My mom can tolerate pain at 88 years old. My mom also had cupping afterwards (mistake on our part). They use regular glass jars (pickles, spaghetti, etc...) instead of the ones i have seen. they were big and I pray that they sanitized them everyday. my mom bled on one of the bottles where the needle was inserted but i think because the jars were huge compare to the small ones we have seen, it pulled a lot of her skin. Again I told Tracy and she said 10 more minutes. I should have taken them out myself. My mom has been in pain since we left there which was on March 19. The acupuncturist seemed knowledgeable but this is what my mom experienced. We had to call our family doctor to get some pain medicine. I wish it was a better experience for my mom but it was not.
