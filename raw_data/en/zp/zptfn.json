Illinois uses the standardized data collection methods developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). These method s are used in a total of 50 sites that include 47 states, New York City , Washington DC , and Puerto Rico. Data are collected through mailed surveys with telephone follow -up for non- respondents . A systematic stratified random sample of approximately 180 mothers is selected monthly from a frame of eligible birth certificates. At two to six months after delivery, the PRAMS program mails an introductory letter and survey to each sampled mother. The program follows up with those who do not initially respond, sending them a reminder letter and two additional survey mailings . PRAMS interviewer s telephone mothers who do not respond to any of the mailed surveys to administer the survey by telephone. Surveys are available in English and Spanish, and telephone interviews are conducted in both languages. In 2019, a total of 2,099 women were select ed to participate in the study ; 1,235 women completed the survey. Data w ere weighted and are representative of the 12 -month PRAMS -eligible population of 132,415 recent mothers . Data collection during 2019 marks the fourth year of using the Phase 8 PRAMS survey. Due to COVID -19, data collection ceased from March 17 through May 31, 2020. Three affected 2019 batches were recovered when data collection resumed June 1, 2020. T he 2019 results include a full calendar year of data. Sampling Design A systematic stratified random sampling design is used to oversample low birthweight ( less than 2,500 grams) births. The sample is st ratified by low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) and normal birthweight (2,500 grams or greater). The 201 9 overall weighted response rate is 59%. The weighted response rates by infant birth weight are 57% for low birth weight and 59% for normal birth weight . Weighting and Interpretation of Results Statistics are based on weighted data. CDC developed the weights to adjust for sample design, non- response patterns, and omissions from the sampling frame. The final sampling weight used to analyze the survey data is the product of these three elements. Weighting is necessary to give unbiased estimates of population parameters. The p ercentages, 95 percent confidence intervals , and total estimated population affected were calculated using Survey Data Analysis ( SUDAAN\u00ae *) software. Estimates for response categories with small cell size (i.e., respondents < 30 in denominator or < 6 in numerator ) are not reported due to possible imprecisio n. PRAMS data are representative of Illinois resident women, age 14 years or older, who gave birth in Illinois to live infants . The sampling design is valid at the state level and not intended or developed to represent sub-state geographies or their populations without further evaluation. The data are not applicable to all pregnant women. At the direction of IDPH legal counsel, w omen younger than 18 years of age were not asked questions about physical abuse. Acknowledgements The Illinois PRAMS project would like to thank all the mothers who participated in our survey.
