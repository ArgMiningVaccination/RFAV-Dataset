These cost-effective alternative services are called \"in lieu of services\" (ILS). What you should know about ILS: - ILS is only available through Medicaid managed care. Medicaid managed care plans can only offer an ILS if they have the State\u00b4s approval. - ILS is voluntary. You do not have to use the ILS if you would rather have the regular covered Medicaid service. - There can be many different types of services offered as ILS. - ILS may be limited to enrollees who meet certain criteria. For example, the ILS may only be available to people who are a specific age or who live in a certain area. - ILS may be limited in quantity or duration. For example, you may only be able to get the ILS for 15 days. - ILS may be limited to a specific setting. For example, you may only be able to get the ILS if you are in a certain type of hospital. Other ILS may only be an option if you are living at home. - The MMCO may decide to stop offering the ILS. The MMCO will send you a notice if this happens. - You have the right to a plan appeal and/or State Fair Hearing if you are not happy with a plan decision about your care, including a decision about ILS. See your plan\u00b4s member handbook for more information about complaints and appeals. The following charts list ILS that has been approved by New York State.
