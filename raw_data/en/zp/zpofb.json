The sites focus on health frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct. Their main goal is to provide [quackery](/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quackdef.html)-related information that is difficult or impossible to get elsewhere. To help visitors with special areas of interest, there are sites that cover autism, chiropractic, dentistry, multilevel marketing, and many other problematic areas. The Internet Health Pilot site provides links to hundreds of reliable health sites. Casewatch contains a large library of legal cases, licensing board actions, government sanctions, and regulatory actions against questionable medical products. All of these can be accessed through the \"Visit Our Affiliated Sites\" drop-down menu above. Their contents can be searched all at once through our search page. We also offer a [Health Fraud Discussion List](http://lists.quackwatch.org/mailman/listinfo/healthfraud_lists.quackwatch.org) with more than 550 members and [Consumer Health Digest](http://www.quackwatch.org/00AboutQuackwatch/chd.html), a free weekly e-mail newsletter that summarizes scientific reports, legislative developments, enforcement actions, and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. Its primary focus is on health, but occasionally it includes non-health scams. About Quackwatch [Mission Statement](/about/mission/) [Tips Funds Quackwatch](/00AboutQuackwatch/funding.html)?
