Campbell started her spiritual journey over 20 years ago while studying holistic practices focusing on Massage Therapy specifically an ancient technique called Amma Therapy, which is a classical form of Asian bodywork that predates acupuncture. Where the acupuncturist would use needles, the Amma Therapist uses their fingers to manipulate these points. As her studies progressed she became more and more focused on the nutrition aspect of the therapy which led her to switch gears to become a culinary arts specialist with a focus on organic and local cuisine and how proper nutrition not only effects the body but the brain. T.A. has travelled the world and in doing so has met and studied with some of the greatest practitioners of spiritual and energy healing. This book and the several to follow will dive deep into these practices breaking them down in an approachable and easy to understand guide so that anyone will be able to benefit from her experience and all that she is learned in the last 2 decades. \u00a9 Copyright 2019, All rights reserved.
