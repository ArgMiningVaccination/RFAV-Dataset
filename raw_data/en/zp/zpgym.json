This climate encouraged me to become a naturopathic consultant and establish an integrative naturopathic medicine practice in Decatur, GA. [The Center for Natural Health & Optimal Wellness LLC ](https://www.cnhow.org/about-us/)serves not only locals but patients throughout the country. What is Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine is an alternative approach to health care that uses natural, non-toxic therapies to treat the whole person and encourage the self-healing process. However, the hallmarks of naturopathic medicine are twofold: Use of holistic modalities to address the true underlying causes of a person's disease rather than looking at symptoms alone; and empowering people to make lifestyle changes necessary for the best possible health. A Family Background in Natural Healing Many Americans are raised to rely solely on traditional medical doctors for medical treatment. However, in my parents' household, I was raised alongside a tradition of natural remedies, where certain herbs were just as natural and common as aspirin. Our healthy beginnings have their roots in my mother's love for family and the legacy of a Native American medicine man. Medicine men have a deep-seated commitment to treating the whole person, including the mind, body, and spirit, as well as maintaining the balance of life and dedication to their community. My great, great-grandfather, Dan Wildcat, was a prominent Cherokee medicine man of the Cherokee nation. He passed these values, beliefs, and traditions to his granddaughter, and later my holistic mother passed them to me. It was this passing of the torch from one generation to the next that first sparked my interest in naturopathic medicine. A Mother's Wisdom My mother, Gloria Dabney, personally introduced myself to homeopathy at an early age. After falling out of my treehouse and severely injuring my leg, my mother treated the injury by applying an herb paste to my leg, followed by a bandage and a gentle kiss on the forehead for good measure. Although somewhat skeptical of this mode of treatment, I could not find any trace of the injury the next day - not even a bruise or scrape or lump. From that moment on, I became less critical of Mom's home remedies and more curious about their curative properties. As I matured, I took an active interest in herbs. My mother took me into her confidence and as her apprentice, I learned about the principals of herbs, natural products, and nutrition. This knowledge helped me unlock some of the secrets of natural medicine. Most importantly, though, I learned patience and profound respect for nature and its amazing wonders. Continuing the Legacy My mother instilled in me the value of human compassion, a love of natural medicine, and an understanding of the importance of community service. I proudly watched her dedicate her efforts in our community and change the way people thought about natural health. She set up a foundation for healthy living that is preventative in the broadest sense. She captured the essences of the kind of doctor I wanted to become. It is through her tremendous efforts, dedication to our community, support, and guidance that inspired me to become a naturopathic doctor. Mom, thanks for being you, and inspiring me to pass the torch of natural medicine to our next generation.
