Kilgore and Batmunkh Nyambat Division of Translational Research, International Vaccine Institute, PO Box 14 Kwanak, Seoul 151-600, Republic of Korea ABSTRACT In the past 30 years, great strides have been made in immunizing infants and children routinely in developing countries under the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Despite this, the introductionof Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines has progressed rather slowly compared to previous- ly-introduced vaccines for infant immunizations. This slower uptake has been attributed partly to theneed for data on the burden of invasive Hib disease. To understand this need, conceptual underpinningsand prerequisites were explored for Hib disease-burden studies. Methodological approaches were alsoreviewed for conducting Hib disease-burden studies that may be considered in developing countries.Potential studies span a range of designs that provide varying levels of clinical, laboratory and epi-demiologic evidence of the burden of invasive Hib disease. Carefully-conducted studies can lay thefoundation for complementary studies of long-term disability due to invasive Hib disease, nationaleconomic analysis, and field evaluations of vaccine. Studies done in collaboration with national agen-cies and clinical investigators will maximize study value and provide critical data for national deci-sion-makers who make choices regarding the introduction of Hib vaccines. Key words INTRODUCTION past several decades, a number of new vac- cines have been introduced into the routine immuniza-tion programmes of developing countries starting withthe earliest efforts of the World Health Organization(WHO) in the global smallpox-eradication campaign andthe establishment of the Expanded Programme on Immu-nization (EPI) (1). During the 1970s-1980s, as deve- loping countries introduced routine infant immuniza-tions, there was little doubt among international health officials and national public-health decision-makers thatthe basic childhood vaccines, already available in deve-loped countries for 20 or more years, were desperately needed to reduce morbidity and mortality among infantsand children (2,3). Following the development and routine introduction of new vaccines for hepatitis B and Haemophilus influ- enzae type b (Hib)-associated disease in developed countries, the use of these new vaccines in developingcountries was felt to be a natural next step (4,5). However,the introduction of these vaccines has lagged behindtheir introduction in developed countries by more than10 years (6). A number of countries still do not usehepatitis B vaccine as a routine immunization, and agood number of developing countries have yet to beginHib immunization. In the case of hepatitis B vaccines, Correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed to: Dr. P.E. Kilgore Division of Translational ResearchInternational J Health Popul Nutr Sep 2004 247 a number of factors associated with delayed introduc- tion have been identified, including problems with know-ledge of disease burden, cost of vaccines, supply of vac-cines, and immunization programme logistics of deli- vering an increasing number of vaccines to infants (7). The experience over the past 20 years with hepatitis B and Hib vaccines has underscored the need for under-standing the degree to which new vaccine-preventable diseases are a problem for a given population. This know-ledge allows decision-makers to place a given disease in the overall context of national public-health prob-lems. This process of understanding the extent of a par-ticular disease problem requires effort to establish theburden of disease. BURDEN OF DISEASE In general, the burden of disease is represented by the sum total of outcomes that include both morbidity andmortality associated with a particular pathogen or dis-ease (8). Thus, the burden for a number of pathogens,such as Hib, requires consideration not only of potentialoutcomes, e.g. hospitalizations, but recognition that Hibis capable of causing different disease manifestations(9). Thus, to account for the impact of Hib in children,we consider moderate or severe manifestations of inva-siveHib disease, e.g. meningitis, pneumonia, and sep- sis, that may lead to emergency visits, hospitalizations,clinical sequelae, or death (10). Prior to the introduction of Hib vaccine in deve- loped countries, Hib-associated deaths were frequent(11). In developing countries where access to health-care is limited, Hib-associated mortality is thought tobe high. Previous studies in several countries have shownthat the highest number of Hib-associated deaths occur among children aged less than five years, especiallyamong children aged less than two years (12,13). Inaddition to death, children who survive serious dis-ease, such as Hib meningitis, are often affected by life-long disability due to permanent damage of the centralnervous system that leads to neurologic deficits (14).Such disability may lead to physical or cognitive deficits.Other severe manifestations include meningitis, pneu-monia, and sepsis, and may require emergency depart-ment treatment or hospitalization. Because of these severe disease manifestations and their associated outcomes, accurate estimation of the bur-den of invasive Hib disease in studies can provide important insights for health policy-makers who must make important choices regarding public-health inter-ventions that will be financed with public or interna-tional donor funds. Appropriately-conducted burden-of-disease studies often provide previously unavailabledata that show the relative importance of diseases. Resultsof burden-of-disease studies may also be used for pro-jecting or modelling what might be the impact of agiven vaccine when used in a routine immunizationprogramme (15). In this way, data from baseline Hibdisease-burden studies, conducted prior to the intro-duction of Hib vaccine, provided valuable informationfor later comparisons. Since 1993, global organizations, including World Bank and WHO, have developed the concept of dis-ability-adjusted life years (DALY) (16). DALYs are aparameter used for quantifying the burden of diseasethat incorporates measures of both years of life lost andyears of life lived with disability. The use of DALYs isparticularly useful when comparing benefits, costs, andoutcomes prevented with alternative public-health pro-grammes, such as a new vaccination programme.Estimation of DALYs associated with invasive Hibdisease can incorporate information on morbidity andmortality collected in the course of Hib disease-burdenstudies. Initially, one might think that disease-burden stud- ies provide few insights into the importance that otherkey opinion leaders, such as clinicians, attribute to a givendisease (17). However, in some cases, those who areconducting disease-burden studies often communicatewith national agencies and staff who can directly useand disseminate disease-burden data. In this way, col-laborative studies that involve clinicians, laboratoryscientists, national public-health officers, and othernational public-health workers can provide intangiblebenefits beyond the valuable data that such studiesgenerate by themselves. CONCEPTS IN MEASURING BURDEN OF DISEASE Value of disease-burden information Early childhood immunizations were typically intro- duced into routine national schedules in the absence offormal epidemiologic or clinical studies or surveillanceinformation on the rate or number of cases of a given disease, e.g. pertussis (18,19). Why has the pub lic-health New vaccines in developing countries 248 environment changed and why are the disease- burden data now needed? In part, this trend results from a grow-ing number of public-health challenges that are eithernew, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome, or re-emerging diseases, e.g. tuberculosis. Another factor forlower-income countries has been the demand on the part of donor agencies that local agencies show evi-dence that a given disease is worthy of substantial investment (20). An additional factor may relate to the higher cost of new vaccines. The first EPI vaccinescould be purchased at a substantially lower cost thannew vaccines against Hib. As a result, the addition of aHib vaccine in a national immunization programmerepresents a greater national financial commitmentcompared to previous vaccine introductions (21). In earlier efforts to define the burden of invasive Hib disease, investigators conducted studies designedto estimate the population-based incidence of Hib andother diseases (22,23). These studies were typically con-ducted over a defined period to enable the calculationof annual incidence rates and used data collected eitherprospectively or retrospectively (24). Data from suchstudies have been used in conjunction with populationcensus data for directly estimating the total number ofchildren expected to suffer from Hib disease. Popu-lation-based studies, while often considered to providethe highest-quality data, are also more challenging dueto the effort required for comprehensive case detectionin large populations (25-28). A number of Hib studies have been conducted in sin- gle hospitals or networks of hospitals over a wide geo-graphic region (29). Such studies allow determination ofthe proportion of meningitis due to Hib but are less well-suited to providing estimates of Hib incidence (30,31).Nonetheless, hospital-based studies, conducted in a net-work of hospitals simultaneously or in a number of dif-ferent hospitals over time in a given country, may pro-vide stronger data compared to data from a single hos-pital-based study (32,33). Such may be the case whenstudies are done in ethnically- or geographically-diversepopulations within a given country. Increasingly, investigators globally are gaining expe- rience in conducting more rigorous disease-burden studiesrelating to invasive Hib disease. In Africa, 26 countriesinitially participated in a laboratory-based surveillancesystem for paediatric invasive bacterial meningitis (34).In such systems, data are collected in systematic sur-veillance with laboratory-based testing that provides confirmed diagnoses using microbiologic culture methods. Surveillance systems such as this may provide the firstand only Hib data for national decision-makers. As aresult, these data may provide the foundation for laterdisease-burden estimates. More recently, efforts have been made to obtain indirect estimates of burden of invasive Hib diseaseusing retrospective reviews of hospitalizations and lab-oratory records of cerebrospinal fluid and blood culturespositive for Hib (35). These indirect estimates also take advantage of previous studies in which the proportionof meningitis or pneumonia due to Hib has been ascer-tained either through prospective laboratory-based sur-veillance for Hib or in Hib vaccine studies in which theproportion of pneumonia or meningitis prevented byHib vaccine is used for estimating the proportion ofdisease due to Hib (36,37). This approach has led tothe development of a tool to rapidly assess the burdenof Hib disease (38). While still relatively new, thisapproach offers an alternative for countries where it isnot feasible to conduct either large-scale population-based studies or sustained laboratory-based hospitalstudies. Although not typically considered in the category of disease-burden studies, case reports of invasive Hibdisease may be the only evidence that Hib is a cause ofillness among children (39-42). While such data maybe useful to local doctors when considering individualtreatment decisions, they provide little evidence thatHib is more than just a sporadic disease. As such, casereports should be considered only as evidence of thepresence of invasive Hib disease in a given locationwhere it may be impossible to conduct either a rapiddisease-burden assessment, hospital-based or popula-tion-based surveillance. Local capacity for studies Prior to initiating disease-burden studies to assess inva- sive Hib disease, it is crucial to evaluate the nationalcapacity that exists to support epidemiologic surveil-lance and microbiologic laboratory diagnosis of Hib. Ifsurveillance or a disease-burden study is contemplatedin a province or district, attention must first be directedto understanding the ability of local clinicians and lab-oratory workers to identify children with bacterial menin-gitis (43,44). If the local capacity does not exist or existsfor one aspect of surveillance, e.g. epidemiology, but doesnot exist for another, provisions must be esta blished to Kilgore PE and Nyambat B J Health Popul Nutr Sep 2004 249 ensure that adequate training is conducted among workers who will be responsible for surveillance. In general, themore complex the study, e.g. population-based surveil-lance, the greater the need to ensure that adequately-trained personnel are in place to conduct surveillance. The microbiologic laboratory capacity must exist or be developed prior to starting studies where investiga-tors will use laboratory-confirmed outcomes. In manycountries, the local microbiology laboratory capacitymay vary greatly. Thus, in some settings, it is neces-sary to adapt laboratories to use less technology-inten-sive methods (45). In addition, investigators should havea clear documentation of local laboratory proceduresbefore the start of formal microbiology laboratory train-ing begins (46). Such information will be critical to design appropriate laboratory training and follow-upinspection schedules. Local laboratories must demon-strate accurate and consistent identification of invasivebacterial Timing of studies The choice of when to conduct Hib disease-burden studies may be crucial and, whenever possible, should be care-fully deliberated with local and national public-healthleaders. Because the capacity to conduct the surveil-lance of invasive Hib disease often requires clinical and/or laboratory training programmes and novel surveil-lance procedures for local staff, it is helpful if there arefew diversions or other major public-health programmesthat are initiated at the same time and in the same loca-tion where Hib surveillance is likely to take place.While this might be the ideal situation, it is not uncom-mon for public-health emergencies to develop thatdemand the involvement of local health workers whoalso might be involved with Hib surveillance. Similarly,other events, such as work stoppages by emp loyees of hospitals or clinics, may also place stresses on surveil-lance for Hib. In other cases, conflicts may arise withincommunities or countries that are conducting Hib sur-veillance. In many situations, while it may be impossi-ble to change the stressful circumstances having a nega-tive impact on surveillance, development of contin-gency plans may be possible to mitigate the impact onsurveillance and the detection of invasive Hib disease. Involvement of key stakeholders Stakeholders for Hib disease-burden studies will include individuals or groups that have an interest in data to be generated from studies on Hib. Stakeholder groups typically include donor agencies, vaccine advisory com-mittees, paediatricians, parents, and public-health leaderswithin national agencies responsible for making deci-sions regarding the introduction of new vaccines. Thus,prior to initiating surveillance, it is valuable to knowwhat audience will receive the Hib study data. In thisway, study investigators can help ensure that resultsare communicated to stakeholder groups in an appro-priate and timely fashion. APPROACHES TO BURDEN ESTIMATION Measurement of outcomes Studies of the burden of invasive Hib disease focus on identification of children suffering from manifestationsof severe disease, such as meningitis, pneumonia, andsepsis. Studies also detect children who die in hospitalwith confirmed Hib disease. Often, disease-burden studieswill detect children who suffer clinical sequelae at thetime of discharge or transfer from the hospital. Becauseadditional effort or resources are needed to follow chil-dren several weeks or months after discharge fromhospital, relatively few recent studies have describedlong-term clinical sequelae associated with Hib. Options for study design Choosing an appropriate design for Hib burden inves- tigations is crucial, but resource limitations should notprevent moving forward with limited studies whenthere is national commitment to gaining informationon invasive Hib disease (Appendix). Thus, even withlimited resources, studies can be initiated to collect dis-ease-burden data. Financial resource-limited studiesshould not be equated with reduced intellectual rigour or reduced efforts on the part of lead investigators to bevigilant and maintain close attention to details of con-ducting the study. In this sense, it may be more prudentto start small-scale studies, e.g. surveillance in a singlehospital, and ensure that all children with suspectedinvasive Hib disease enter the surveillance system. In the case of prospective study designs (e.g. hospi- tal-based or population-based), an essential element ofsurveillance are those methods used by clinicians andepidemiologists that help ensure that all children withsuspected Hib disease do, in fact, undergo evaluationwithin the surveillance system. If incidence rates of inva-sive Hib disease are expected to be low or moderatelylow (e.g. <10/100,000 or 10-25/100,000 children <5 years New vaccines in developing countries 250 respectively), clinicians must take great care to conduct parent/guardian interviews and physical examinations ofall children who present with signs and symptoms ofinvasive bacterial disease. Such children must, wheneverpossible, undergo appropriate examinations and collec-tion of laboratory specimens. Depending on the studyduration, sufficient efforts must be expended in sustainingattention of clinician to systematic evaluation and collec-tion of CSF, blood, or other clinical specimens. In the case of retrospective hospital-based studies or when using the rapid disease-burden assessment, epi-demiologists and laboratory workers have the greaterresponsibility to identify hospitals with laboratories whereadequate microbiological testing has been performedover a sustained duration (47). In these studies, carefuland comprehensive review of the existing computerizedor paper hospital records is of paramount importance.An intimate knowledge of the laboratory operating pro-cedures can be valuable when activities involve reviewinglogbooks to identify the number of CSF or blood culturesthat grow Hib. Collaboration and frequent discussionswith senior microbiologists are essential to ensure that all culture results are reviewed for a given study period. Bias considerations Those conducting Hib disease-burden studies and those who use study findings may be able to anticipate char-acteristics of the study population, surveillance hospi-tals, and characteristics of the health system that couldintroduce potential biases that ultimately influence eitherthe number of patients with Hib disease identified or thecalculation of incidence rates, or both. These biases mayresult from inadequate consideration of healthcare-seek-ing behaviours or healthcare institutions where parentsbring children for care of serious or life-threatening dis-eases. They may also stem from inadequate knowledgeof study clinicians regarding the signs and symptoms ofdisease that require prompt medical attention, evaluation,and collection of laboratory specimens. Other biases mayinclude partial or complete absence of patient referralwhereby local doctors, e.g. private clinics, choose to eva-luate and treat patients with suspected invasive Hib dis-ease rather than to participate in surveillance by referringpatients to a nearby hospital where CSF and/or blood canbe collected for microbiologic culture. Other potentialsources of bias may limit the detection of fas tidious Hib organisms when specimens are not transported or proces- sed within a relatively short time.Analysis Plans for analysis of surveillance data may be easily overlooked when one is in the planning stages or earlyphases of surveillance. However, establishing an analyticstrategy is essential to ensure that appropriate data arecollected and that weekly or monthly reviews of dataare focused on ensuring that complete and accuratedata are recorded. Incomplete data discovered at theend of a study or surveillance period may preclude ana- lysis of valuable data on one or more key outcome(s) forthe disease-burden study. Time must be taken to planhow data will be presented in both periodic interim reports and the final report. If appropriate to the studydesign, methods for the calculation of inci dence rates of invasive Hib disease should be described and under- stood by study investigators. Increasingly, performanceindicators are being used in surveillance and disease-burden studies. Such indicators help monitor the prog-ress of data collection and the quality of surveillanceactivities. Statistical comparisons of surveillance indi-cators from month to month provide valuable feedbackto clinicians, laboratory workers, and epidemiologistswho perform day-to-day surveillance activities. Integration of outcome studies National leaders with responsibility for decision-mak- ing may view invasive Hib disease from different per-spectives. Some may value the calculation of incidencerates and the fact that these can be used for estimatingthe annual number of expected patients with invasiveHib disease. Some may value the fact that studies yieldcredible data on the number of children who may dieas a result of invasive Hib disease or the case-fatalityrate among children with serious Hib disease. Otherdecision-makers may wish to know the proportion ofchildren who suffer long-term or even lifelong disabilitydue to invasive Hib disease. Finally, other decision-makers may wish to compare the burden of invasiveHib disease based on DALYs (48). Such diverse needscan be met by anticipating that study results from dif-ferent time periods, populations, or that were derivedfrom different methods should be integrated into a pack-age of Hib-burden information that is easily digested bynational decision-makers with or without a clinical orlaboratory background. Reporting study results In the planning stages of a burden study, simple tabu- lations and sample figures can be created to illustrate Kilgore PE and Nyambat B J Health Popul Nutr Sep 2004 251 how data will be reported. Reports should be brief and written in a relatively simple language to allow under-standing by readers with varying backgrounds. Outcomesof epidemiologic studies, e.g. incidence rates, can be'translated' into a simpler language to maximize under- standing among readers. One approach that may beused involves showing the risk of disease in terms ofpercentage risk (e.g. x children out of every 10) or mayconvert risk into language where the risk of a givenoutcome is placed in terms that use a \"lowest commondenominator\" (e.g. 1 child in every 8 will develop Hibdisease). Finally, in using these simpler approaches toquantifying outcomes of Hib-burden study, it is usefulto consider quantifying risk over a defined period orage group (e.g. 1 in every 20 children will be hospital-ized for Hib disease each year). Alternatively, investi-gators may express the outcome as a cumulative risk ofan outcome event (e.g. 1 in every 8 children will deve-lop Hib disease by the age of 5 years). IMPLICATIONS OF HIB-BURDEN STUDIES Economic analyses Hib disease-burden studies provide data that can be critical for sound economic analysis of Hib-preventionprogrammes. Data inputs with respect to Hib-associat-ed disease-incidence rates, mortality rates, case-fatali-ty, and the occurrence of clinical sequelae may comefrom a number of different sources, including pub-lished scientific articles, government reports, or per-sonal communications from experts in the field. Thequality of data used in economic analysis of Hib-prevention programmes is also important to under-stand and consider prior to initiating economic studies.Thus, one rationale for conducting high-quality Hibdisease-burden studies is that they can provide data foruse in making optimal cost-effectiveness or cost-benefitcalculations for Hib disease-prevention programmes. Evaluation of vaccine Evaluation of Hib vaccine in the context of a large- scale vaccine-demonstration project is often consideredto address policy uncertainties (49). Evaluation of Hibconjugate vaccines (vaccine-effectiveness studies orso-called vaccine 'probe' studies) following the introduc-tion of vaccine may also be considered to evaluate the programmatic impact of Hib immunization (50). In thelatter case, national health agencies may have ongoingactive surveillance systems in which laboratory-confirmed Hib disease is identified (51). As such, disease-burden studies in which active or passive surveillance is con-ducted for laboratory-confirmed Hib-associated dis-ease can take on added value when such systems areused for evaluating the impact of Hib immunization asHib vaccine uptake increases (52,53). In other cases,passive reporting of Hib-associated cases is used forestimating the population impact of Hib immunizationover a defined period (54). In still other situations,infants may be randomized by group or individual toreceive Hib vaccine or another vaccine while all chil-dren are monitored in ongoing surveillance for Hib-associated disease (55,56). Hib disease-burden data,e.g. cases of meningitis, can also be evaluated retro-spectively or prospectively to evaluate the impact ofHib immunization (57). In this study design, cases maybe matched with controls to compare those children whoreceived Hib vaccine with those who did not receive Hibvaccine (58-60). Post-introduction surveillance If the introduction of Hib vaccines is planned, the bur- den of Hib can be monitored as noted above to evaluatethe impact of vaccine, reduction in incidence of disease,and Hib vaccine-related adverse events (61). Adverseevents following any vaccine are of critical importanceto immunization programmes, and adverse events, inclu-ding breakthrough disease, can be monitored following the administration of Hib vaccine. Surveillance of ad-verse events may be conducted with passive or activereporting of events (62). Most reporting systems moni-tor events passively, and such events can be tabulatedperiodically to estimate the burden of these events. CONCLUSION The introduction of Hib vaccines in developing coun- tries is currently limited by a number of factors. Pro-minent among these are limited evidence that invasiveHib disease is a problem of sufficient importance towarrant investment in vaccination programmes. Whilethe first childhood vaccines were introduced withoutsystematic disease-burden studies, contemporary na-tional policy-makers and international donors mustoften consider the need for Hib vaccine against com-peting priorities. In this scenario, disease-burden studiesalso become valuable as tools to provide data for eco-nomic studies and vaccine-evaluation projects and tobuild infrastructure for post-introduction evaluation ofthe impact of vaccine. While disease-burden studies New vaccines in developing countries 252 have increased in sophistication in recent years, practi- cal limitations must be addressed to design studies thatare feasible and that provide credible evidence. Whilepopulation-based studies may be considered, alternativestudy designs, such as hospital-based studies or vaccineprobe studies, may provide useful evidence to guidepolicy-makers especially when combined with studiesof long-term sequelae and economic analysis.
