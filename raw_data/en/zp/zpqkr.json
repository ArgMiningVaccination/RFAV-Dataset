Addiction can be an unending, agonizing struggle for the person using drugs; suffering is needlessly compounded when people cannot access evidence- based care or are subjected to discrimination. The consequences of drug use can have ripple effects that hurt families, potentially across generations, as well as friends and colleagues. Using drugs can endanger health and mental health and is especially harmful in early adolescence. Illicit drug markets are linked with violence and other forms of crime. Drugs can fuel and prolong conflict, and the destabilizing effects as well as the social and economic costs hinder sustainable development. The whole of the international community shares the same goals of protecting the health and welfare of people everywhere. But too often in the debate on drug policy approaches, we forget this basic and shared understanding, which is rooted in the fact that drug use for non-medical purposes is harmful. We all want our children and loved ones to be healthy, and we want neighbourhoods and countries to be safe. As policymakers, we can see that illicit drug cultivation offers no way out for impoverished communities in the long run, that the drug trade has environmental impacts, and that drug trafficking along with associated corruption and illicit flows undermine the rule of law and stability. Solutions to these shared threats and challenges to achieve our shared goals must also be shared and based on evidence. It is in this spirit that I am proud to present the World Drug Report 2022 from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. This is the first World Drug Report of the post-pandemic world. While countries continue to grapple with COVID-19 and its consequences, we have emerged from cycles of lockdowns to confront a \"new normal\" . And we have found that the world post-pandemic remains one in crisis, faced with multiple conflicts, a continuing climate emergency and threat of recession, even as the multilateral order is showing troubling signs of strain and fatigue. World drug challenges further complicate the picture. Cocaine production is at a record high, and seizures of amphetamine and methamphetamine have skyrocketed. Markets for these drugs are expanding to new and more vulnerable regions. Harmful patterns of drug use likely increased during the pandemic. More young people are using drugs compared with previous generations. People in need of treatment cannot get it, women most of all. Women account for over 40 percent of people using pharmaceutical drugs for non-medical purposes, and nearly one in two people using amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), but only one in five in treatment for ATS is a woman.PREFACE 4 WORLD DRUG REPORT 202235 In the face of these multiple crises, we need to show greater care. Care starts with evidence-based prevention and addressing perceptions and misperceptions of risk, including by taking a hard look at the messages our societies are sending to young people. UNODC research has shown that perceptions of cannabis harms have decreased in areas where the drug has been legalized. At the same time, the proportion of people with psychiatric disorders and suicides associated with regular cannabis use has increased, together with the number of hospitalizations. Some 40 per cent of countries reported cannabis as the drug related to the greatest number of drug use disorders. Whole-of-society approaches are needed to ensure that people, young people most of all, have the information and develop the resilience to make good choices and that they can access science-based treatment and services for drug use disorders, HIV and related diseases when they need it. There can be no effective prevention or treatment without recognition of the problem and the necessary funding to address the problem. Public resources are stretched to the limit by competing demands, but we cannot afford to let commitment wane. We need to promote compassion and better understanding. Care in crises means ensuring services and essential medicines for all, including people in emergencies and humanitarian settings; people left behind in the pandemic; and people facing barriers of stigma and discrimination. Care is also manifested in shared responsibility, and we need to renew international cooperation to sustainably reduce illicit crop cultivation and tackle the criminal groups trafficking drugs. The World Drug Report seeks to offer the data and insights to inform our joint efforts. This year's edition delves into the interplay between drugs and conflict, the impact of drugs on the environment and the effects of cannabis legalization, and identifies dynamics to watch, from the opiate market in light of developments in Afghanistan to dark web drug sales. I hope the report serves as a basis for effective responses, and generates the support we need to continue shedding light on different aspects of the world drug problem, and assisting Member States to take action and save lives.

Countries and areas are referred to by the names that were in official use at the time the relevant data were collected. Since there is some scientific and legal ambiguity about the distinctions between \"drug use\" , \"drug use\" is used in the World Drug Report. The term \"misuse\" is used only to denote the non-medical use of prescription drugs. All uses of the word \"drug\" and the term \"drug use\" in the World Drug Report refer to substances controlled under the international drug control conventions, and their non-medical use. The term \"seizures\" is used in the World Drug Report to refer to quantities of drugs seized, unless otherwise specified. All analysis contained in the World Drug Report is based on the official data submitted by Member States to the UNODC through the annual report questionnaire unless indicated otherwise. Sex-disaggregated analysis has been included wherever possible. The data on population used in the World Drug Report are taken from: World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division).

The first chapter of the present booklet starts with an analysis of the global supply of and trafficking trends in cannabis resin and herb. It provides the latest esti - mates on cannabis use and discusses the latest trends in regional cannabis markets. The chapter also briefly reviews the medical use of cannabinoid-based phar - maceutical products and the extent to which countries allow medical use of cannabis products. The chapter continues with a brief overview of the latest develop - ments in cannabis regulations in selected countries and concludes with a detailed analysis of early indica - tions of the impact of cannabis legalization on public health, public safety, market dynamics and criminal justice responses in the jurisdictions in North America that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis. The second chapter of the booklet provides an over - view of opioids as a group of substances and their patterns of non-medical use at the global level. It also reviews the latest trends in the global supply of opiates and synthetic opioids and the availability of pharma - ceutical opioids for medical consumption. Issues specific to regional patterns and trends in opioid mar - kets are also analysed, including the opioid crisis in North America and in Africa and the Middle East. The chapter also includes a discussion of the potential impact, in the region and worldwide, of changes in opium poppy cultivation and opium production in Afghanistan. IMPACT OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION Public health ArrestsEconomy Driving Illicit marketCrime ReplacementProducts 313 CANNABIS | Global supply of cannabisCANNABIS remained true for 2020, with most Member States again reporting increases on their territory. Growth in indoor cannabis cultivation seems to outpace growth in outdoor cultivation In 2019 and 2020, reported growth in indoor cannabis cultivation appears to have again outpaced growth in outdoor cultivation at the global level, with the overall net number of countries reporting increased indoor cultivation being three times the net number of coun - tries reporting decreased outdoor cultivation. While qualitative reporting has strong limitations, the pat - terns that emerge from it suggest an upward trend. The number of countries reporting indoor cannabis cultivation rose from 48 in the period 2011-2015 to 66 in the period 2016-2020. A total of 98 countries explic - itly reported outdoor cannabis cultivation in the latter period.Global supply of cannabis Cannabis cultivation is near universal Cannabis is illicitly produced in every region. Cannabis cultivation was reported either through direct indica - tors (such as cultivation or eradication of plants or eradication of production sites) or indirect indicators (seizure of plants, reports on origin of seized cannabis) by at least 154 countries in the period 2010-2020. If qualitative information on indoor and outdoor canna - bis cultivation trends is also considered, this number rises to more than 190 countries and territories.1 That distinguishes cannabis from coca/cocaine and opium poppies/opiates, for which cultivation/production is concentrated in a much smaller number of countries and, hence, their illicit trade is most often international in the sense of crossing international borders. Cannabis cultivation has trended upward for a decade, according to qualitative assessments, and this GLOBAL SEIZURES /two.lf/zero.lf/two.lf/zero.lf +/one.lf/five.lf% herb+/two.lf/nine.lf% resin Change from previous year cannabis tons/two.lf,/one.lf/nine.lf/zero.lf tons cannabis resin /two.lf/zero.lf/nine.lf million GLOBAL NUMBER OF USERS /two.lf/zero.lf/two.lf/zero.lf * Data refer to 2020.14 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Historically, most countries reporting indoor cultiva- tion have been in Europe and North America, but recent years have seen them joined by countries in numerous other regions and subregions. Cannabis trafficking: the prior downward trend in global seizures was reversed in 2020 Quantities of cannabis herb and resin seized clearly increased in 2020. This halted a decade of declining seizures of cannabis herb, a trend which accelerated in the period 2015-2019 when a number of jurisdictions in North America legalized non-medical cannabis. The increase in global seizures in 2020 is in line with reports that cannabis use increased during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in many countries.a The overall year-on-year increase in quan- tities of cannabis seized amounted close to 20 per cent in 2020, the biggest upward jump since 2015. Cannabis seizures made outside North America reached an all- time high in 2020. In contrast to the overall decline in cannabis herb sei- zures between 2010 and 2019, the trends in cannabis trafficking (based on qualitative reporting from Member States) rose over the last decade. Despite the limitations that such qualitative reporting poses in terms of transparency and consistency, this trend sug - gests an increase in cannabis herb trafficking. In 2020, a See als o Booklet 2 of the present report, Global overview of drug demand and drug supply.Source countries for cannabis Estimating the global area under cannabis cultivation is challeng - ing as most countries do not have systems in place to systematically monitor this indicator. Some countries do report total area under cannabis cultivation, but most of these reported estimates are not based on standard methods and thus have limitations in being used for international comparisons. In addition, a number of indi - rect indicators are available, such as on on \"origin of cannabis seized\" , which can provide some indications with respect to cannabis cultivation. While any single such indicator alone is insufficient for revealing the extent of cannabis cultivation and production, when they are analysed together, they can still point to countries where sub - stantial cannabis cultivation is likely to exist.i Analysis of the various indicators for the period 2010-2020 sug - gests that in the following countries there is a sizable cultivation of cannabis that is (a) exported or (b) produced for domestic con - sumption (listed by order of importance in each subregion): >Americas North America: United States of America, Mexico, Canada South America: Paraguay, Brazil, ColombiaCentral America: Guatemala, Costa Rica, HondurasCaribbean: Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago >Africa Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Eswatini, Ghana, Zambia >Europe Western and Central Europe: the Netherlands, Spain, Czechia, Italy, Switzerland South-Eastern Europe: Albania, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria Eastern Europe: the Russian Federation, Ukraine >Asia Near and Middle East/South-West Asia: Afghanistan, Lebanon, Pakistan Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, KazakhstanTranscaucasia: Azerbaijan, Armenia South Asia: India, Nepal South-East Asia: Philippines, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, Indonesia >Oceania Australia, New Zealand i D ata for direct and indirect indicators have been combined to identify those countries likely to have a significant area under cannabis cultivation.315 CANNABIS | Global supply of cannabis Seizures of cannabis resin increased to a record high in 2020.

In 2020, more than 4 per cent of the global population aged 15-64 (209 million people) had used cannabis in the past year. The prevalence of past-year cannabis use has increased by 8 per cent, from 3.8 per cent in 2010, while the number of people who used cannabis in the past year increased by 23 per cent, from 170 million in 2010, partly owing to increase in global population. Prevalence of use of cannabis varies widely by region and is highest in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and West Africa. Compared with adults, the past-year prevalence of cannabis use is reported to be higher among adoles - cents (5.8 per cent in those aged 15-16).b b See als o Booklet 2 of the present report, Global overview of drug demand and drug supply.Scientific literature indicates that early initiation of substance use impacts the developing brain of adoles - cents.

The gender difference in the use of cannabis, for instance, can be attributed more to opportunities to use drugs in different settings than to biological and psychological differences between men and women in the use of substances and the devel - opment of substance use disorders. The gender-defined environmental and sociocultural roles for men and women contribute significantly to the initiation and course of substance use and, thereafter, the develop-ment of substance use disorders. 7, 8, 9, 10 c Ibid.FiG. 7 U se of cannabis, by region and subregion, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

These conditions include, among others, chronic pain, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis-related spasticity, and some types of epilepsies. Some cannabinoids are also suggested for use as an antiemetic in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who fail to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. vii The following cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals, with marketing authorization, are currently approved for medical use in a number of countries:vii, ix, x Dronabinol. Oral capsules or an oral solution containing synthetic THC. Dronabinol is indicated for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, usually after previous treatments have failed. Nabilone. Oral capsules containing synthetic cannabinoid similar to THC, for use to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemo - therapy, usually after previous treatments have failed. Nabiximols. A medicinal product containing approximately equal quantities of THC and CBD from two cannabis extracts. This product has been authorized for the treatment of muscle spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis.Epidiolex. A plant-derived CBD oral solution indicated for the treat - ment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older. Currently, 64 countries have provisions in their national legislation or guidelines allowing medical use of cannabinoid pharmaceutical preparations and/or cannabis herb for a range of medical conditions and with varying degrees of restrictions or permissiveness. Of those 64 countries, 34 countries allow the use of both pharmaceutical prepa - rations and cannabis herb for medical conditions. In essence, all countries that allow medical use of cannabis herb also have provi - sions for medical use of cannabinoid pharmaceutical preparations. Around 40 countries reported to INCB in 2020xi their estimates of production, consumption or stocks of cannabis for medical purposes. Since 2011, an increasing number of countries have started to use cannabis and cannabis extracts for medical purposes, as well as for scientific research.

While overall, the market of major drugs includ - ing that of cannabis turned out to be remarkably resilient to these changes, during the pandemic some patterns of use by people regularly using drugs, includ - ing cannabis, showed some change.d, 11 Data available from Europe suggest that there were differences between and within countries in the avail - ability and consumption of cannabis during and after the lockdown periods. For instance, a web-based survey from Europe showed that people who regularly used cannabis (defined as weekly use) were twice as likely to report increased frequency of use as were those who were occasional users during lockdowns and were three times more likely to report consuming greater quantities. Occasional users were more likely to have reduced or stopped using cannabis during lockdowns.12 Stay-at-home measures were also reported to have been in part responsible for increased home cultiva - tion of cannabis.13 Over the years, wastewater analysis for cannabis has been undertaken in only a few sites in Europe, and those have shown both considerable heterogeneity and variation in weekly patterns of cannabis consumption in the various locations. Also, the different characteristics of national, regional and local drug use patterns and of the lockdown measures implemented make comparisons challenging. Among the few locations, in Amsterdam and in Castell\u00f3n, Spain, a slight, although not significant, decrease in cannabis metabolite mass loads in 2020 compared to 2019 was observed, while in 2020 no significant differences from the preceding year were observed in Utrecht and Eindhoven in the Netherlands. 14, 15 In Canada, in 2021, nearly half of the people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months reported that they had used the same amounts of cannabis and with the d See als o Booklet 2 of the present report, Global overview of drug demand and drug supply.same frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions as they had before. More than a quarter of those who had used cannabis reported greater amounts and greater frequency of use than before the pandemic. Young people (24 years and younger) were more likely to report an increase in the amount and frequency of use during the lock - down restrictions compared to older people (25 years and older) who used cannabis. Among these older people, 25 per cent reported using more cannabis during the COVID-19 pandemic, which compares to 46 per cent among those aged 16-19 years and 40 per cent among those aged 20 and 24 years.16, 17 Almost half of persons detained by Australian police and interviewed for cannabis use patterns reported use in the previous 30 days, which was not significantly different from the cannabis use reported by police detainees before the pandemic. However, some change could be noted in frequency of use. Past-month users were significantly more likely to have increased use during the pandemic and were more likely to be heavy users, reporting a median of cannabis use of 25 days per month as compared with a median of 15 days per month as reported by detainees before the pandemic. Quantities of cannabis used during a typical session did not change (a median of 0.34 grams), although some detainees reported purchasing greater quantities of cannabis than usual at the onset of the pandemic to guard against potential shortages, and some reported substituting cannabis with benzodiazepines, methamphetamine and other drugs. Cannabis supply appeared stable during the pandemic, with detainees reporting continued high availability and unchanged quality of product. 18, 19 Regional trends in cannabis markets Trafficking in cannabis herb continues to be mainly intraregional Unlike many other drugs, cultivation, trafficking and use of cannabis herb takes place primarily within the same region or subregion.20 While most regions reported intraregional trafficking of cannabis herb, there were exceptions. For Oceania, the most fre - quently mentioned countries of origin, departure and 3 CANNABIS | Regional trends in cannabis markets21transit in the period 2016-2020 were the United States, the Netherlands and Canada.21, 22 The United States and Canada were also frequently mentioned as coun- tries of origin, departure and transit by countries in East and South-East Asia.Cannabis resin seizures are geographically concentrated, but key trafficking flows are interregional Seizures of cannabis resin continue to be concentrated in North Africa and Western Europe, which together form a single de facto production, trafficking and con - sumption area for cannabis resin, accounting for almost 60 per cent of global seizures in the period 2016-2020, as well as South-West Asia, another major production, trafficking and consumption area accounting for about one third of the global total. Those two areas are fol- lowed by the Near and Middle East.23 Seizure and other data suggest that most trafficking of cannabis resin is from Morocco to Spain, and from Afghanistan to other countries of West Asia. Spain serves as the primary gateway for markets in Western and Central Europe.24 Cannabis resin from Morocco is also destined for other North African countries.25 Intra - regional trafficking runs from Morocco to Libya and then Egypt, via the Sahel,26 as well as internal land routes from western Algeria to that country's borders with Tunisia and Libya, despite strong security con - trols.27 Cannabis resin is also transported by sea via the southern Mediterranean coastal route.28 Cannabis resin produced in Afghanistan is mostly traf - ficked to neighbouring countries.29 Other key trafficking Most frequently mentioned countries of origin, departure, and transit for cannabis herb in the period 2016-2020 (In order of number of mentions by countries worldwide) >Americas North America: United States, Canada, Mexico South America: Colombia, ParaguayCentral America: Guatemala, HondurasCaribbean: Jamaica >Africa West and Southern Africa: Mozambique, South Africa, Malawi, Eswatini East Africa: United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya North Africa: Morocco >Europe Netherlands, Albania >Asia South-East Asia: Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand South Asia: India, Bangladesh, Nepal Near and Middle East/South-West Asia: Afghanistan, Lebanon Central Asia and Transcaucasia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.FiG. 9 D istribution of quantities of cannabis resin seized, 2016-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.North Africa 21% Western and Central Europe 33%South - West Asia 39%Near and Middle East 3%Other 4%22 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022flows include routes through Central Asia, mainly for destinations within the subregion and the Russian Fed - eration, as well as routes from production areas in Lebanon, to other countries in the Near and Middle East and Europe. Americas report most cannabis herb seizures, but lower interception rates lead to strong decline in seizure figures The Americas reported almost 60 per cent of global cannabis herb seizures in the period 2016-2020. How - ever, the overall share of the Americas for cannabis herb seizures has declined significantly, falling from 84 per cent of the global total in 2010 to 58 per cent in 2020. The positive correlation between drug use and drug seizures in North America disappeared over the course of the last decade, during which time cannabis seizures decreased by 84 per cent despite the significant expan - sion of the cannabis market. Seizures were down 76 per cent in the United States alone over the period 2010-2020, even though the number of people using cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis rose by almost 130 per cent. 30 This divergence between seizures and use trends in the United States and Canada suggests lower cannabis interception rates, mainly the result of changes in laws that legalized the supply of cannabis for non-medical use in several jurisdictions, as well as possibly the lower FiG. 10 Q uantities of cannabis resin seized, by country, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.0100200300400500 Spain Morocco Afghanistan Pakistan Iran (Islamic Republic of) Algeria France Egypt Turkey Portugal Saudi Arabia Lebanon OtherTons Europe North Africa South-West Asia Various regions Near and Middle East0 20 40 60 80 100Other Central AsiaIndiaNepalIran (Islamic Republic of)KyrgyzstanAlbaniaLebanonPakistanNetherlandsSpainAfghanistanMorocco Number of times mentioned as country of origin and departure by reporting countriesOrigin DepartureFiG. 11 M ain countries of origin and departure of cannabis resin as reported by Member States, 2016-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

More- over, the legalization of cannabis supply for non-medical use in some jurisdictions has reduced the size of the illegal cannabis market and therefore decreased seizures.e Mexico also reported a strong decline in sei - zures as higher potency cannabis became widely available in the United States and organized criminal groups shifted their focus to other drugs.31 incr easing health harm of cannabis in Western and Central Europe Around 29 million people are estimated to be past-year users of cannabis in Europe. Annual prevalence of can - nabis use in Western and Central Europe has fluctuated between 6 and 8 per cent over the past decade (2010- 2020). Among the countries in Europe that have reported recent survey data, many countries indicate a trend of an increase in cannabis use in recent years. Cannabis use in the European Union reflects the global trend for a higher prevalence among adolescents and young adults (15-24 years old), with past-year use among this age group estimated at 19.2 per cent.32 Based on data from 26 Western European countries,f both the number of people regularly using and the frequency of cannabis use has increased: past-month prevalence among the adult population (15-64) e See the s ection of the present Booklet, Cannabis legalization. f In this s ection, Europe refers mostly to member States of the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.0100200300400500600 India United States Brazil Colombia Egypt Paraguay Moro cco Argenna Mexico Nigeria Spain Indon esia Turkey France Thailand Ecuador Canada Zambia Chile Jamaica OthersTons Americas Asia Africa Europe Various regions FiG. 14 T rends in cannabis use among countries in Europe that reported recent data in 2020 Sources: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire; and EMCDDA, \"Statistical Bulletin 2020: prevalence and patterns of and WalesHungary Ireland Latvia Netherlands Norway Spain SwedenAnnual prevalence (percentage) 0246810121416 2004 20082015 2020 2007 20082012 2016 2020 20122015 2019 2008 2010 2012 20132014 20152016 2017 2018 2019 2010 2011 2012 2013 20142015 2016 20172018 2019 2007 2015 2019 2007 2011 20152019 2007 2011 20152020 2005 20092014 20152016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2004 2009 2013 20142015 2016 20172018 2019 2020 2009 20112013201520172020 2010 2011 2012 20132014 2015201620182020 Austria Bulga ria rlands Spain SwedenAnnual prevalence (percentage)24 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022increased by 27 per cent to 3.9 per cent in the period 2010-2019;33 the proportion of daily or near-daily users also increased to 1.8 per cent, mostly among young people, in 2019, compared with approximately 1 per cent earlier.g, 34 At the same time, the potency of cannabis products available in Europe has also increased. Between 2010 and 2019, THC content in herbal cannabis increased by 40 per cent and that of cannabis resin nearly tripled.35 With these dynamics - increase in exposure to high-po - tency cannabis products, regular and frequent cannabis use - harms related to the use of cannabis are increas - ingly apparent in the general population in Western and Central Europe.36 There has been a notable increase in treatment admissions related to cannabis use and psychiatric comorbidities. Between 2010 and 2019, in the European Union, the rate of people entering treat - ment with cannabis as their primary drug increased from 27 to 35 per 100,000 of the adult population. In 2019, around 35 per cent of all people who entered specialized drug treatment services in the European Union were for treatment of cannabis use. More than half of first-time clients were using the drug daily. Can - nabis was also the most common substance of use reported in emergency rooms,h where it was present in 26 per cent of acute drug toxicity cases, usually alongside other substances.37 In a case-control study conducted at 11 sites in Brazil England, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spaini involving patients presenting first episode psychosis and adult population from the same places, cannabis use was associated with a three times greater likeli - hood of psychotic disorder compared with individuals who had never used the drug; daily use of high-potency cannabis (more than 10 per cent THC) increased the risk of psychotic disorder more than fourfold compared g 61 per c ent of the daily or near daily users are estimated as people under 35 years of age. h This is bas ed on reporting from 23 hospitals in 17 countries that participated in the EURO-DEN Plus Network. i The st udy was implemented between May 2010, and April 2015, in 11 sites in England, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Brazil. The cases included 901 patients with first episode psychosis and 1237 population controls from those same sites. The participants were aged 18-64 years and included an equal number of men and women.with the risk for those who had never used cannabis.38, 39, 40, 41 As a country-level example, an increase in cannabis use and much higher increase in cannabis-related harms have been observed in Germany. The past-year cannabis use has increased, especially since 2013, by 50 per cent. Meanwhile, admissions related to mental and behavioural disorders due to cannabis use increased considerably between 2000 and 2018, as have admissions related to cannabinoid dependence and withdrawal, which were up more than eightfold, and admissions for cannabis-related psychotic disor - ders, which have more than quadrupled.42 The increase in the number of inpatient cannabis-re- lated cases in Germany has been attributed to many factors, including the debate on the legalization of cannabis; amendments to the Narcotics Law and other regulations in 2017 that expanded options for physi - cians to prescribe cannabis-based products under certain conditions; and increased availability of can - nabis-based products with high THC (and low CBD) content and synthetic cannabinoids.

West and Cen - tral Africa have the highest prevalence of use in the region at 9.7 per cent, to a large extent reflecting past- year use of cannabis in Nigeria.46 Half of all people treated for drug use disorders in Africa in 2020 were treated for cannabis as the primary drug of concern (a far higher proportion than in any other region), with the figure rising to 55 per cent in West Africa, or almost 3 per 100,000 of the adult population.47 In North Africa, around one third of all people treated for drug use disorders were treated for cannabis use disorders.48 In South Africa, over one third of attendees of special - ist drug treatment services in 2020 were being treated for cannabis as the primary or secondary drug of con- cern.49 Most of those people were aged 20 or younger.Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis As of January 2022, legal provisions allowing the pro- duction and sale of cannabis for non-medical use have been approved in Canada and Uruguay, as well as in 21 jurisdictions of the United States (18 states, two territories and the District of Columbia). Canada and most of the 21 jurisdictions in the United States allow for production and sale by for-profit industry, while in Uruguay there is a partially controlled and state-reg - ulated retail market. There are differences in the level of regulation and control from jurisdiction to jurisdic - tion, which is likely to have varying impacts on cannabis use and related harms and public health and safety outcomes.j j F or more information on cannabis regulations in each jurisdiction in Canada, the United States and Uruguay, see table at the end of the present chapter and previous WDRs.05,00010,00015,00020,000 2000 200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018Number Unspecified mental and behavioural disorder (F12.9) Other mental and behavioural disorder (F12.8) Residual and late-onset psychotic disorder (F12.7) Amnestic (F12.6) Psychotic disorder (F12.5) Withdrawal state with delirium (F12.4) Withdrawal state (F12.3) Dependence syndrome (F12.2) Acute intoxication Cannabis -related inpatient cases in Germany, 2000-2018 Source: Based on data given in table 2 of Gahr et al., \"Incidence of Inpatient Cases with Mental Disorders Due to Use of Cannabinoids in Germany\" .

A reduction of CBD in relation to THC in cannabis products may heighten health risks because there are indications that CBD may mitigate some of the psychoactive effects of THC on the human body. An increased ratio of THC can increase dependency and the chances of psychiatric comorbidities.vii i Na tional Institute on Drug Abuse, \"Marijuana Potency,\" National Institute on Drug Abuse, April 1, 2021. ii UNODC estimates based on EMCDDA, \"Statistical Bulletin 2021, Price, Purity and Potency; and UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. iii Na tional Institute on Drug Abuse, \"Marijuana Potency.\" iv M ary Catherine Cash et al., \"Mapping Cannabis Potency in Medical and Recrea- tional Programs in the United States,\" ed.

These practices differ from full legalization as they do not allow the same level of can - nabis commercialization as approved in Canada, Uruguay and the 21 jurisdictions in the United States. This section describes some of these measures and provides examples in selected countries. The cultivation of cannabis for personal use has, in the past, characterized so-called \"cannabis clubs\" in some European countries, in particular Spain and Belgium. Cannabis social clubs are typically non-profit associations of adult cannabis users who collectively cultivate, produce and distribute cannabis among themselves, on the basis that one adult can cultivate one or a small number of plants for personal use. In 3 CANNABIS | Developments in measures regulating the non-medical use of cannabis27some models, the social club produces cannabis for the members.50, 51 In the Netherlands, it is illegal to possess, sell or pro- duce drugs, including cannabis. However, the Netherlands has a policy of tolerating the sale of can- nabis for personal use in coffee shops, which have been able to sell small quantities of cannabis for personal consumption since 1970.52 As the cultivation and sale of cannabis is not permitted, coffee shops have obtained their cannabis from illegal sources. Coffee shops are licensed by municipalities, although only about one third allow such shops to operate.53 To combat drug-related crime and nuisance, as of 1 Janu- ary 2013, only residents of the Netherlands (living and registered in a Dutch municipality) may visit coffee shops and purchase cannabis there. How actively this rule is enforced differs from municipality to municipality. In December 2021, the Government of Malta passed a law on \"responsible use of cannabis\" . The law allows people aged 18 years and older to possess up to 7 g of cannabis, domestic cultivation of up to four cannabis plants and the storage of up to 50 g of dried cannabis product. In addition, people can form Non-Profit Organisations with a Risk and Harm Reduction approach k for the purpose of cultivating cannabis exclusively for the organization's members in a collec - tive manner. Such organisations may distribute the cultivated cannabis only to its members, similar to the cannabis clubs described above. The law also foresees creating a regularized and safe source from which a person can obtain cannabis and cannabis seeds in lim - ited and controlled amounts, under strict conditions.54 Under the law, possession of cannabis in any amount for personal consumption by people under the age of 18 is decriminalized, and those found in possession of cannabis now go before a commission for justice for the recommendation of a care plan rather than facing arrest.55 In 2018, the Constitutional Court of South Africa56 ruled that the use and possession of cannabis, and the cul- tivation of cannabis plants by an adult in private, for that adult's personal consumption in private is no longer a criminal offence. This ruling was in recognition of the constitutional right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution. Adultsl may now use and possess canna- bis and cultivate cannabis plants in quantities that are sufficient for their personal consumption in any private, non-public place. k Non-P rofit Organizations with a Risk and Harm Reduction approach are non-profit by design, aiming to move away from the commercialization of cannabis, and instead serve to provide a safe space for the consumption of cannabis, while also allowing for quality control, regulation and monitoring by the Authority on the Responsible Use of Cannabis of Malta. l A dults in the South African population are considered those 18 years and older.Trafficking trends in cannabis herb difficult to identify in Africa Trends in trafficking of cannabis herb in Africa remain difficult to identify on the basis of seizure data due to large fluctuations in the reporting by Member States and, in some countries, the lack of proper differentiation by law enforcement author - ities between seizures of cannabis herb and plants. Cannabis herb seizures in Africa accounted for 20 per cent of the global total in the period 2016-2020, most of which were reported by countries in North Africa (60 per cent of all cannabis herb seized in Africa) and West and Central Africa (33 per cent). But this reflects the higher rate of reporting data in North African countries. However, if a longer period is considered, in order to increase data cov - erage, West and Central Africa have a share of seizures similar to North Africa.

The international drug conventions do not define the concepts of \"depenalization\" , \"decriminalization\" , and \"legalization\" , but these terms are often used in the drug debate, particularly in the context of cannabis. They nonetheless contain provisions \"to address drug-related behaviours, including the commission of serious offences, the commission of offences of a lesser relative gravity and the commission of offences by persons who use drugs\" .i As a general obligation, the international drug control conventions of 1961 and 1971 require States parties to establish measures to limit the production, manufacture, export, import and distribution of, trade in, and possession of controlled drugs, exclusively to medical and scientific purposes, subject to the provisions of those conven- tions.ii As a substance subject to control under the 1961 Convention, these provisions also apply to cannabis. Accordingly, any of the above-mentioned activities conducted for non-medical and non-scientific purposes are inconsistent with the legal obligations of the State parties to the conventions. The inter - national drug control conventions do not require States parties to establish criminal offences for drug use. The INCB has recently clarified that \"measures to decriminalize the personal use and pos - session of small quantities of drugs are consistent with the provisions of the drug control conventions\" .i Decriminalization is defined by INCB as \"the process through which an offence is reclassified from \"criminal\" to \"non-criminal\" through legislative action\"; while the behaviour remains an offence, it may be addressed through other means than criminal law.iii Legalization is frequently associated with the regulation and com - mercialization of controlled drugs, such as cannabis, for non-medical and non-scientific purposes entailing no penalty (whether criminal, administrative, civil or otherwise) for production, manufacture, export, import and distribution of the drug. Decriminalization and legalization are quite distinct concepts, as decriminalization in the context of minor drug offices is within the provisions of the international drug conventions, legalization is not.iv The term depenalization has been used in different contexts and languages with different meanings.iii According to INCB, a depenal - ization approach may include: \"police diversion practices, conditional sentences and the widening of prosecutorial discretion as an alter - native to criminal prosecution\" . Depenalization differs from decriminalization since it refers to situations where certain con - ducts, for example cannabis possession and trade, remain criminal offences but with a reduction in the use of existing criminal sanc- tions. In contrast to decriminalization, depenalization may not require a change in the legal framework. INCB highlights the flexibility afforded to States within the drug control conventions to make differentiated policy choices and adopt legal frameworks which avoid disproportionate responses to drug-re - lated behaviours of a minor nature or when committed by people who use drugs,v while ensuring effective responses to serious drug-related behaviours. i See paragraph 371 in INCB, Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2021 (E/INCB/2021/1). ii See ar ticle 4(c) of the 1961 Convention and article 5(2) of the 1971 Convention. iii See par agraph 378 in INCB, Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2021 (E/INCB/2021/1). iv See par agraphs 376 and 377 in INCB, Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2021 (E/INCB/2021/1). v See par agraphs 380 and 381 in INCB, Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2021 (E/INCB/2021/1). In the Netherlands and Switzerland, laws have recently been passed to regulate scientific experiments on can - nabis. In July 2020, the Government of the Netherlands extended its regulations to allow an experiment with cannabis cultivation and production for supply to coffee shops.57 This \"closed coffee shop chain experi- ment\" (also known as the \"weed experiment\") will permit 10 growers to legally produce cannabis to supply coffee shops in 10 participating municipalities.58 Coffee shops in these municipalities will be able to sell cannabis produced by these cannabis farms during the experiment. The experiment will run for four years and will be independently evaluated to observe the effects on public health and crime.59 In 2021, Switzerland passed the Ordinance on Pilot Trials under the Narcotics Act (BetmPV), which pro- vides the legal framework for the regulated sale of cannabis. Cantons, municipalities, universities and other organizations will be able to conduct pilot trials to gain scientific knowledge about alternative approaches to regulating the non-medical use of can- nabis. Only adults who can prove that they already use cannabis will be eligible to participate. The trials will 3 CANNABIS | Analyzing the impact of cannabis legalization29also test different cannabis products that have varying THC/CBD contents.60 Analyzing the impact of cannabis legalization A combination of drivers, public policy concerns and ambitions have led to countries and state-level juris - dictions in Canada, the United States and Uruguay legalizing the entire cannabis supply chain and adopt - ing measures allowing the production and sale of cannabis for non-medical use by commercial and for-profit entities. Those concerns or aspirations include: >Permitting non-medical use of cannabis among adults while preventing its use among adolescents >Addressing criminal justice responses because treat - ing the possession of cannabis for personal use as a criminal offence had led to many people being arrested and acquiring a criminal record, with ethnic minorities being disproportionally affected by such policies in countries such as the United States >Establishing a regulated market to ensure product quality (THC content) and prevent the use of haz - ardous contaminants in production >Preventing organized crime groups from generating profits from the illicit trade in cannabis >Reducing both law enforcement costs, especially the policing of possession for personal use of cannabis, thus freeing up resources to address more serious crimes >For governments and authorities themselves to gen - erate revenue from the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis, depriving organized crime groups of income and investing part of the revenue in pre- vention of substance use and treatment of drug use disorders, thus protecting public health and safety.61, 62, 63 Any attempt to assess the impact of cannabis legal - ization would include the review of some of those desired outcomes. IMPACT OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION Public health ArrestsEconomy Driving Illicit marketCrime ReplacementProducts 30 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Caveats in assessing the impact of cannabis legalization In assessing the impact of cannabis legalization, there are several issues that need to be taken into consideration. There are systematic differences within countries and different contexts within jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis. Thus, comparing outcomes across jurisdictions do not offer a natural experiment and it doesn't inform about the impact of cannabis legalization. Looking at changes in an indicator relative to before and after in jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis versus those that have not can also be misleading because trends in an indicator can be independent of legal - ization status. Many trends observed in outcome measures in countries and states that have legalized cannabis cannot be simply taken out of context, nor can those measures be replicated in other countries as such. In different jurisdictions, the degree of development of the cannabis market, social constructs and existing policies could differently mitigate or exacerbate the impact of cannabis legalization. Importantly, the full effects of legalization on public health, safety and criminal justice will take decades to become apparent. In most jurisdictions, cannabis production and supply chains are being developed and have not yet stabilized. A few years after the legalization of non-medical use of can- nabis may not be long enough to provide an adequate indication of the impact of cannabis use on public health as cannabis markets are still developing. i Implementing a policy of cannabis legalization is not an on/ off light switch, although the typical research study design imagines that to be the case. The movement towards legal - ization has, in many jurisdictions, been a generational and continuous evolution. In most states of the United States and in Canada, the path towards legalization came through initia - tives allowing medical use of cannabis, and those initiatives had varying degrees of permissiveness and restriction. For example, the first two states of the United States to legalize cannabis, Colorado and Washington, even before the public voted for legalization in 2012, had medical cannabis dispen-saries that sold cannabis products. Thus, the legal supply of cannabis predated de facto formal legalization, and that could have had a greater impact on the extent of cannabis use than did the subsequent formal legalization. There are also methodological challenges in monitoring out - comes of cannabis legalization such as the health impact of cannabis. >The prevalence and frequency of cannabis use as reported in general population surveys is in essence self-reported behaviour and has a degree of underreporting, a phenom-enon also seen in the case of alcohol use. The legal status of a substance affects people's willingness to self-report such behaviour. In addition, there can be challenges in cap- turing or measuring the use of the wide range of cannabis products that have been introduced in the market, such as edibles, concentrates and vaping: the usual survey question of \"Have you used marijuana?\" may be interpreted by some respondents in a narrower sense, that is, that it refers only to smoking cannabis herb. >Reporting of cannabis poisoning cases, especially among children, can be straightforward, whereas statistics on emer - gency room visits and hospitalizations attributed to cannabis use among adults can reflect both the actual change in people suffering from a condition as a result of cannabis consumption and the degree to which people are willing to report to and utilize health-care services. >Measuring blood levels of THC to monitor impaired driving could be misleading because peak impairment does not occur when THC concentration in the blood is at or near peak levels. In addition, concurrent use of alcohol and can - nabis can cause a higher degree of impairment than cannabis alone. Assessing cannabis legalization is a complex undertaking and existing literature should be read with a critical approach. Cannabis legalization can potentially affect areas of interest such as public health or public safety, differently, with some favourable effects in some areas and unfavourable effects in others. Given the polarization of views on cannabis legaliza-tion, advocates are often selective in how they aggregate or combine different indicators to focus exclusively on outcomes whose trends favour their pre-existing conclusions. i W ayne Hall and Michael Lynskey, \"Assessing the Public Health Impacts of Legalizing Recreational Cannabis Use: The US Experi- ence,\" World (June 2020): 179-86, /doi.org/10.1002/wps.20735.3 CANNABIS | Analyzing impac t of cannabis legalization: an overview DomainChanges observed after legalization (temporal sequence/outcome/impact)Is it a clear trend in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized or is it a local trend?What does the evidence reveal about the impact of legalization? Public health Each country and jurisdiction that has legalized cannabis started with a different level of cannabis use and thus the impact of legalization on the extent of use among adults may be different. In jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, cannabis use started to increase before cannabis was legalized, mostly when laws allowing medical cannabis made cannabis widely available including for recreational use. While the change in prevalence after legalization is clear, that change may only partially reflect the impact of legalization. Legalization may have simply accelerated a dynamic that had begun earlier. In fact, the legalization of cannabis may be partly the result, rather than the cause, of the expansion of the cannabis market, occur - ring at the same time as a decrease in the risk perception of cannabis use and an increase in regular use. However, in Canada, after legalization, people using cannabis had an increasing perception of the addictive nature of cannabis. - Adult use General increase in cannabis use, with a narrowing gender gap and a more pro-nounced increase in frequent use among young adultsA general increase in cannabis use is observable in the United States, Canada and Uruguay. In Canada in 2021, there was a first sign of decrease in past-year and past-month use, but not in daily use; and after legalization, the perception among users that cannabis is an addictive drug increased. - Use among adolescentsWhile cannabis use remains high among the cohort of adolescents in the United States and Canada as compared to other countries, it is generally stable or decreasing. However, daily use and vaping are increasing.Cannabis use among adolescents increased in Uruguay, while in the United States and Canada, it is either decreasing or stable, although it remains compara-tively high among the cohort of adoles - cents who were surveyed. - Use among women of reproductive age, especially use among pregnant womenCannabis use among women of reproductive age, including prior to, during and after pregnancy, continued to increase after legalization, but increased more strongly in states that have legal-ized cannabis (where a higher level of cannabis use among women of reproductive age, including pregnant women, was already visible before legalization). Evidence on trends in and levels of canna-bis use among women of reproductive age, including pregnant women, before and after legalization, is available in the United States, where this is regularly monitored.The more marked increase in cannabis use among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy observed in states where cannabis was legalized may be explained only partially by the legalization per se since the increasing trend and the higher level of use in legalizing states predated legalization. The increase in cannabis use is in large part due to a decreasing risk perception of cannabis use and to self-medication during preg - nancy. - Harmful use of cannabis and health consequencesAfter a sharp increase during the years following legalization, cannabis-related emergency department visits and hospi-talizations have stabilized. Emergency department visits related to edibles have had the largest increase, especially for children. There is an increasing trend in cannabis use disorders that likely started in the years before legalization; there is also an increase in the proportion of people with psychiatric disorders and suicides associated with regular cannabis use.Evidence on cannabis-related hospitaliza-tions and emergency department visits before and after legalization are available for two jurisdictions in the United States, Colorado and California, and for Canada. Evidence on cannabis use disorders, depression and suicide is available for the United States and Canada. A \"simultaneous quadruple confluence\" of increasing preva-lence of use, increase in intensity (frequency and quantities) of use, increasing THC content of cannabis products and increas - ing hospitalization due to cannabis use and cannabis use disor - ders, have all likely interacted multiplicatively after legalization, and it is challenging to extract the net impact of legalization on each factor. The sharp increase related to edibles suggests that legalization has directly opened up access to more harmful cannabis prod-ucts that have increased the overall health harm of cannabis.The much sharper increase in the proportion of cannabis pres - ent in increasing suicide deaths as compared to alcohol also suggests that the overall health harm of cannabis has followed the same patterns of use that started to increase before legali-zation, with legalization probably only accelerating and exacer - bating the pre-existing underlying trend. 32 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022 DomainChanges observed after legalization (temporal sequence/outcome/impact)Is it a clear trend in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized or is it a local trend?What does the evidence reveal about the impact of legalization? Substitution/com- plementarity with alcohol and tobaccoNo decrease observed in alcohol use where cannabis was legalized, while tobacco use has declined in a fairly uni-form manner across the entire United States regardless of cannabis regulations.Evidence on a possible substitution effect is limited and that is available only for the United StatesThe evidence available on the possible substitution effect after legalization remains inconclusive. The limited evidence suggests that legalization may have brought complementarity rather than substitution. Cannabis market - Products, potency and pricesThere has been a clear diversification of cannabis products, with very potent products such as concentrates and edi-bles entering the market after legaliza-tion. Average THC level in cannabis has continued to increase after legalization, together with a decreasing level of CBD. The increased THC and decreased CBD levels in cannabis can be observed across the United States, with products in Colo-rado found to have a THC content of up to 79 per cent. Diversification of cannabis products is also observed in Canada. In Uruguay, the THC content, and the range of cannabis products, have largely remained stable at lower levels than in the United States and Canada.While it is not possible to determine the causality between legalization and the diversification of cannabis products and increased potency, it is worth considering whether the way legalization happened in the United States and Canada has favoured commercial interests and the diversification of the market, similar to alcohol and tobacco. Products such as edibles also make cannabis use more palatable compared with smoking. A more regulatory approach, especially of THC content, as adopted in Uruguay may have prevented this diversification in this country. - Size of the illicit marketThe illegal cannabis markets still exist after legalization, but to varying extents, in the different countries and jurisdic-tions that have legalized cannabis. In some countries, the size of the illegal market has decreased since the new reg - ulation was put in place. The recorded extent of the illegal market that remains after legalization varies, from around 40 per cent in Canada to nearly 50 per cent in Uruguay and 75 per cent in Cal-ifornia. In Uruguay, the discrepancies between the number of people registered and those estimated to have used canna-bis in the past month suggest a substantial gap in the legal market meeting the demand from regular users.Legalization has not so far displaced the illegal cannabis mar - kets in the jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized, although the space for the illegal market is decreasing in some jurisdictions. The illegal market remains attractive for different reasons, including price, quality and accessibility. In some juris - dictions, the percentage of cannabis that is sold in the illegal market continues to decrease, and it is not currently possible to determine whether certain models for cannabis legalization are more likely to reduce the size of the illegal market and whether legalization can ever entirely eliminate the illegal market. - Taxes and revenuesTax revenues from the legalized cannabis market have continued to increase. A var - ying part of the revenue has been invested in prevention of substance use and treatment of drug use disorders.Cannabis-related tax revenues have increased in all jurisdictions where canna-bis has been legalized. These annual reve-nues vary from 1.5 billion (Canadian dollars) in Canada to $4.4 billion in Califor - nia. Cannabis tax revenues, however, account for only a small fraction of the total tax revenues of states.Legalization has had a clear impact in terms of the amount of taxes collected from the cannabis market and has added a new resource to the budgets of jurisdictions that have legalized can-nabis. Nevertheless, the revenue collected through these taxes is proportionately small. Public safety - Driving under the influence - Traffic fatalitiesAn increase in driving under the influ- ence of cannabis and cannabis-related fatal car accidents has been observed across the entire United States. No significant change has been observed in the attitude of people towards driving 2-3 hours after consuming cannabis. Drug-impaired driving and treatment admission for driving under the influence of cannabis has continued to increase after legalization. An increase in cannabis-related fatal car accidents has been observed across the United States with no significant differ - ence between states that legalized canna-bis and those that did not. Evidence on attitudes towards driving after consuming cannabis is available for the United States and Canada. An increase in cannabis-impaired driving was observed in Canada, and an increase in treatment admissions for cannabis-impaired driving was recorded in Colorado. Notwithstanding methodological issues in measuring impair - ment of drivers due to cannabis use and the influence of other substances such as alcohol, the evidence available on the impact of cannabis legalization on cannabis-related driving acci-dents is mixed and inconclusive. Evidence suggests that the clear increase in traffic fatalities in a United States state such as Colorado was not caused by legalization, while the increase in drug-impaired driving that started before legalization has been attributed at least partially to increased detection and monitor - ing of people driving under the influence of cannabis.3 CANNABIS | Analyzing the impact of cannabis legalization33DomainChanges observed after legalization (temporal sequence/outcome/impact)Is it a clear trend in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized or is it a local trend?What does the evidence reveal about the impact of legalization? - School discipline Cannabis-related infractions in school remained after legalization the main reason for which students have been expelled, suspended or referred to law enforcement authorities.Trends after legalization are mixed and variable. After a stable or declining trend immediately after legalization, drug-re-lated school suspensions showed some increase. Trends in drug-related school discipline were monitored in the States of California and Colorado. Cannabis legalization does not seem to have led to changes in sanctions given by schools to students due to drug and canna-bis use. The limited evidence available suggests that, if any-thing, cannabis legalization has increased the number of drug- and cannabis-related school sanctions given. Criminal justice response - Arrests and prosecution for possession for personal useAfter legalization, there has been a signif - icant decrease in total arrests for canna-bis-related offences: a sharp decrease for adults, but a small and insignificant reduction for youth.A reduction in arrests is discernible for all races, but the racial disparities in arrests have widened after legalization.A decline in cannabis-related arrests is vis - ible in all United States jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of canna-bis.States of the United States that imple-mented cannabis decriminalization have significantly reduced the rate of youth arrests, while States that legalized canna-bis have not significantly reduced youth arrests. The decline in persons arrested for cannabis offences, especially possession for personal use, in states that have legalized canna-bis became visible the year after legalization, as a direct impact of legalization that took away the criminal basis for arresting people found to be in possession of or trafficking cannabis. However, with cannabis offences still in force for minors, legali-zation has not had any impact on the arrests of youth. It is pos - sible that with legalization for adults, police have focused on youth. - Violent and property crimesNo clear changes in trends can be observed after legalization in crime rates not related to cannabis. An increase in violent crime around can- nabis dispensaries, particularly in low-in-come neighbourhoods has been recorded. Legalization in the United States took place in the context of overall declining crime trends, and, in Canada, of an overall increase (albeit following several years of decreases). After legalization, there have been mixed trends in the United States, with increases in some states that legal-ized cannabis and decreases in others. Studies on crimes affecting communities around cannabis dispensaries provide evi-dence for the States of Washington and Colorado. There is no visible impact of legalization on overall crime rates, although overall rates may mask significant changes at the state or community level. The very limited evidence available on crime affecting communities around cannabis dispensaries sug - gests that the cash-based cannabis economy may increase the risk of burglaries in dispensaries and clients being robbed. Crime rates in a jurisdiction may be more greatly influenced by sociodemographic factors and economic status, as well as dif - ferential policies and law enforcement milieu in those jurisdic-tions than merely by legalization. Commercial interests - Involvement of big corporations in cannabis supply chainsThe legal cannabis industry has flour - ished after legalization, with the growing influence of, and investment by, large cor - porations.Evidence of large corporations that are investing in the cannabis sector was par - ticularly visible in Canada and California. Legalization has led to a new cannabis industry, attracting the interest of large corporations, which see the potential for growth and opportunity for investment. - Entry into cannabis supply chains of corporations involved with tobacco and alcohol supplyThere is an increasing interest and invest - ment in the cannabis industry from the alcohol and tobacco industries, and vice versa.As happened before in the tobacco and alcohol industries, the expansion of a large corporate interest in the cannabis industry has likely resulted in concerted efforts to monopolize the market, advocating for the expansion of the cannabis market, and a proliferation of products targeting an increased base of regular users. Conclusions The evidence available to assess the impact of cannabis legalization in some jurisdictions in the Americas remains patchy and not yet definitive. The period is too short to assess long and enduring changes, and the specific characteristics of the cannabis market as it existed before legalization makes it difficult to assess the net impact of the new regulations. Most of the observable trends and lessons learned remain specific to the context of the jurisdictions where legalization took place and are not easily applicable to other countries and regions where the same regulation could have a different, disproportionate effect on the elements of public health, public safety, the criminal justice response, the cannabis market and commercial interests that are analysed here. 34 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Assessing the impact of cannabis legalization The following section presents data and information that underpin the overview presented above. The discussion on selected key elements is neither all-encompassing nor conclusive but is illustrative of different outcomes of a particular area of interest of cannabis legalization. Public health Changes in the extent of cannabis use among the adult population Cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use have increased in the countries and state level jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis. In the United States and Canada, the increase in can- nabis use started long before legalization. In the United States, a clear expansion of the cannabis market started in 2007/08, long before the first state legalized cannabis, with the main increase being observed in the daily and near-daily use of cannabis and among those aged 18-25 years and those aged 26 years or older.64 As a long-term trend, past-month cannabis use declined after a peak in 1979 before resurging. The extent of cannabis use among women remains low compared with men, but the gap between use of can- nabis by men and by women is narrowing (see the chapter Global use of cannabis). The trend in the last two decades was more marked (with higher rates of increase) in the jurisdictions that legalized non-medical use of cannabis than in those jurisdictions that did not.65 Legalization by itself does FiG. 17 long -term trends in past-month cannabis use in the United States, by age group, 1971-2020 Source: \"Results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables\" (Rockville, Maryland: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020).0510152025303540 1971 1974197719821988199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013201520172019Prevalence (percentage) 12-17 years 18-25 years 26-34 years FiG. 18 T rends in cannabis use and perception of risk of harm among the population aged 18 and older, United States, 2002-2020 Source: \"Results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables\" (Rockville, Maryland: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Past-year use Past-month use Perception of riskBy 2007, 12 states had measures allowing medical use Past-year use Past-month use Percep on of riskBy 2007, 12 states had measu res a llowing medical use of ca nnabis By 2007, 12 states had measu res a llowing medical use of ca nnabis 3 CANNABIS | Analyzing the impact of cannabis legalization35FiG. 19 Cannabis us e in the general population, Canada, 2018-2021 Source: 'Cannabis Use - Data Blog - Public Health Infobase' , Health Canada, 2021. not account for the larger increase in cannabis use in those states where cannabis was legalized. In states that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis, such as Colorado, cannabis use has traditionally been above the national average.66, 67 Predating the expansion of the market were measures introduced in the early adopter states that allowed medical use of cannabis products and herb. The open - ing of retail outlets, brick-and-mortar dispensaries that were loosely regulated and had expansive definitions of conditions that justified obtaining a medical recom - mendation to access medical cannabis, changed risk perceptions of cannabis; allowed easy access to can- nabis products, including cannabis herb; introduced products such as edibles that carried less stigma of using cannabis (even for medical use); and contributed to an increase in cannabis use and cannabis use disor - ders, at least among the adult population.68, 69, 70, 71, 72, m Cannabis use in Canada and Uruguay has also increased post legalization, though not at the same rate of increase or to the same level of use as in the United States. In Uruguay, cannabis use began to increase from much lower levels than in the other two countries. m F requent cannabis use was defined as using cannabis on 300 days in the past year.Unlike in the United States, in Canada, the perception that cannabis can be addictive has increased, especially among people who use cannabis regularly, reaching nearly 90 per cent of people in 2021.73051015202530 Past-year use Past-month useDaily use among those who used in past 12 monthsPrevalence (percentage) 2018 2019 2020 2021051015202530 Past-year use Past-month use Daily use among those who used in past 12 monthsPrevalence (percentage) 2018 2019 2020 2021NARROWING GENDER GAP IN ANNUAL PREVALENCE OF CANNABIS USE IN THE UNITED STATES, /two.lf/zero.lf/zero.lf/three.lf /endash.case /two.lf/zero.lf/two.lf/zero.lf /two.lf/zero.lf/zero.lf/three.lf +/one.tf/three.tf/six.tf/percent.lf+/six.tf/four.tf/percent.lf/two.lf/zero.lf/two.lf/zero.lf Narrowing gender gap/eight.tf./one.tf/percent.lf /four.tf./four.tf/percent.lf/one.tf/zero.tf./four.tf/percent.lf/one.tf/three.tf./three.tf/percent.lf 40 60 80 100OverallAmong people who used cannabis in past monthAmong people who did not use cannabis in past month Percentage 2021 2020 2019 2018FiG. 20 P roportion of people in Canada who con- sidered cannabis use to be \"habit-forming\" (addictive), 2018-2021 Source: \"Cannabis Use - Data Blog - Public Health Infobase\" .36 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Changes in the extent of cannabis use among adolescents Scientific literature indicates early initiation of sub- stance use can be particularly harmful for the developing brain of adolescents.74, 75, 76, 77 Cannabis use among adolescents in state-level juris - dictions and in countries that have legalized cannabis in general seems to have remained stable following legalization,78 although it remains much higher in these jurisdictions than in most countries that have not legal - ized non-medical cannabis. In the United States, there have been a long-term trend of declining cannabis use among grade 10 students, accompanied by a decline in the risk perception of cannabis.

Changes in the extent of cannabis use among pregnant women In general, the trend of an increase in cannabis use among the adult population is also reflected in increased cannabis use among women of reproductive age, including among women prior to, during and after pregnancy.

As more people use cannabis, the likelihood of their suffering medical and health consequences also increases A \"simultaneous quadruple confluence\" of increasing prevalence of use, increasing intensity of use (in terms of both frequency and quantities), increasing THC content of cannabis products, and increasing hospitalization due to cannabis use and cannabis use disorders all likely interact multiplicatively in the context of studying the impact of legalization.93 In the United States, cannabis exposure cases from 2010 to 2017 increased following legalization of non- medical use of cannabis in the state-level jurisdictions.94 In Colorado, cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations (including treatment of cannabis use disorders and dependence) increased considerably since 2013 but have shown a general stabilization since 2018. In emergency room visits, patients may present anxiety, panic attacks, public intoxication, vomiting and other, non-specific symptoms that could be pre - cipitated by the use of cannabis products with varying THC content. This is especially the case with high-THC edible cannabis products, which take longer to reach peak psychoactive effects, which a person is unable to regulate.95, 96 Following the same trend as in Colorado, in California, after the opening of the retail sales market, emergency room visits and admissions for primary cannabis increased by 56 per cent from 2016 to 2019.97, 98 In Canada, from 2015 to 2018, there was an increase of 30 per cent in the annual percentage change in Virginia) who were asked questions specific to cannabis use in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey and who gave birth between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, for a weighted sample reflecting 15,486,000 women. r Cannabis us e among pregnant women was significantly associated with being younger (18-29 years; 66 per cent) and unmarried (68.6 per cent); and low educational achievement (12 years or less; 55.6 per cent).cannabis-related cases reported by the Canadian Hos - pitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program.99 Cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use are associated with depression and suicide Research shows that depression is associated with cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use.100 Suicide FiG. 26 C olorado: cannabis use among women before and during pregnancy and in the post-partum and breastfeeding stages, United States, 2014-2019 Source: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, \"Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)\" , 2017 2018 2019 FiG. 27 C olorado: cannabis-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations, United States, 2011-2020 Source: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, \"Colorado Hospital Association data\" .

In con-trast, the proportion of suicides in which alcohol was present increased only slightly, from 35 per cent to 40.6 per cent over the same period.103 Overall, in the United States, past-year cannabis use disorder, daily cannabis and non-daily cannabis use were associated with a higher prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, plans and attempts among young adults aged 18-23 of both sexes, with significantly higher prevalence among women than men.104 A study in a Canadian hospital emergency unit settingt observed that in the post-legalization period (2018), s F rom the period 2008-2010 to the period 2017-2019, suicidal ideation increased by 64 per cent, plans of suicide 80 per cent and suicide attempts by 50 per cent and daily cannabis use increased by 84 per cent. t The st udy reviewed psychiatric consultations among 1,247 patients who were 18 years or older two years prior to the study (pre-legalization) and 1,368 patients in the post-legalization period (five months after legalization of cannabis).there was a significant increase in the use of cannabis (from 28 per cent to 37 per cent) among patients seeking consultations with a psychiatrist , especially among patients aged 18-24.105 However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of psychotic disorder diagnoses before or after legalization, but there was an increase in the proportion of those diagnosed with a personality disorder in the post- legalization period (increase from 39.6 per cent to 44.9 per cent). As cannabis use and harmful patterns have increased in the United States, the association between cannabis use and depression also increased significantly between 2005 and 2016.

Mixed evidence on the substitution and complementarity of cannabis with alcohol There is mixed evidence as to whether cannabis is used as a substitute for or a complement of alcohol. Some studies based on literature reviews have found more evidence of alcohol used as a substitute than as a com - pliment.108, 109 Nevertheless, there is a strong positive association between regular cannabis and alcohol use in the United States and Canada.110 Overall, alcohol use in the past year remained stable between 2008 and 2019 in Canada.111 In the United States, past-month use of alcohol and binge drinking has remained stable or moderately increased, and tobacco use has declined considerably, while cannabis use has increased substantially.x Like cannabis use, past-month binge drinking was significantly higher in states that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis than in those states that have not. x F or the UNODC analysis states that had legalized cannabis included: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Data on per capita sales of alcohol in Colorado, Oregon and Washington show that since legalization of can - nabis, there has been an increase by 1.7 per cent in per capita alcohol sales in Colorado and a slight decline in Oregon and Washington, implying that there was no evidence that legalization had had a significant impact on the sale of alcohol in those states.112, 113 Consistent with national trends, per capita sales of beer declined in these States while per capita sales of spirits increased.y Another study analysing United States data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that overall, any alcohol use in the lifetime, daily alcohol use and average drinks per day declined from 2002 to 2018 among adolescents and adults aged 12-25, and this decline was more rapid among those who used cannabis (on a daily and non-daily basis) than those who did not.114 y The per c apita sales of beer declined by 3.6 per cent in Colorado, 2.3 per cent in Washington and 3.6 per cent in Oregon.

Public safety Evidence on the increase in driving under the influence and traffic fatalities attributed to cannabis remains inconclusive Studies of the effects of the legalization of non-med- ical use of cannabis on traffic accidents have produced mixed findings, and there is little difference in canna- bis- or alcohol-related traffic fatalities between the states that have and those that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis in the United States.115, 116 The number of fatalities in which the driver tested positive for cannabinoids as the only substance pres - ent increased in Colorado from 23 fatalities in 2013 to 42 in 2019.117 However, while individual states such as Colorado may show an increase in traffic fatalities involving cannabis use, it has been argued that this upward trend would have taken place whether or not non-medical use of cannabis had been legalized. 118 In Colorado, citations for driving under the influence of cannabis use increased by 17 per cent between 2014 and 2017, but the number of citations that involved cannabis and other drugs doubled, and those that involved cannabis and alcohol increased fourfold.119The proportion of adults who reported driving within 2-3 hours of using cannabis in Colorado increased from around 2.5 per cent in 2008 to 3.8 per cent in 2018 and has remained stable since then.120 The proportion of people in treatment for driving under the influence who had cannabis as their primary drug also increased threefold in that same time-span. In Canada, among people who had used cannabis in the past 12 months, 21 per cent reported in 2021 that they had driven at least once within two hours of smok - ing or vaporizing cannabis, a percentage unchanged from 2020.121 The overall rates of people charged with drug-impaired driving increased fivefold between 2009 and 2020. It is possible that at least part of this increase was due to better detection rather than an actual rise in drug-impaired driving. 122 School discipline: cannabis-related infractions remain the main infringements leading to expulsion and suspension While cannabis use remains stable, although at high levels, among high school students, data from two states where cannabis has been legalized, California and Colorado, suggest that cannabis-related infractions in school remain the main infringements for which high school students are expelled or suspended and/or referred to law enforcement authorities. z, 123 z In C olorado, Senate Bill 12-046 and House Bill 12-1345 have 050100150200250300 0510152025 2009 impaired driving: -impaired driving: rate per 100,000 populatioin Drug-impaired driving Overall impaired drivingFiG. 31 Calif ornia public school drug-related expulsions and suspensions, from 2015/16 to 2018/19 Source: Based on the data presented 2020\" .010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,000 Suspension42 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Criminal justice Arrests for possession of cannabis use among adults had declined considerably Over the years, in the United States, including in the states that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis, there has been a substantial decline in both the abso- lute number and rates of people arrested for possession of cannabis for personal use. These trends started long before states began to allow medical or non-medical use of cannabis. Nevertheless, in the state-level jurisdictions that legal- ized non-medical use of cannabis, arrests for cannabis targeted the reform of \"zero-tolerance\" policies in schools, and this may have resulted in the recent reduction in the number of expulsions, suspensions, and referrals to law enforcement.possession declined significantly for adults but not for minors. Legalization of cannabis is explicitly for adults, and, in most cases, youth possession remains a crim- inal offence. Thus, it is possible that legalization for adults has led to a focus of police attention on enforc - ing the law for youths. There is a clear disparity in how adults and youths go through the criminal justice system for possession of cannabis in states that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis. A study comparing seven states with a policy of cannabis decriminalization and four states that had legalized non-medical use of cannabis for adults124 showed that the adult arrest rate for cannabis possession decreased after the implementation of decriminalization in the former group of states and after the implementation of legalization in the latter group of states, but that the decline in youth arrested for cannabis possession for use was not significant in the states that had legalized cannabis. 125 In Colorado, rates of arrest for possession of cannabis among juveniles (aged 10-17) decreased by 42 per cent, but the share of youth increased. In 2019, juveniles accounted for 48 per cent of all cannabis arrests com- pared to 25 per cent in 2012.126 Over the same period, the overall rates of arrest for possession of cannabis declined by 71 per cent. This decline is visible for all races, although racial disparities in the rates of arrest have widened.

Between 2010 and 2019, the rates of most violent crimes (except rape) declined across the entire United States, although the decline in states that had legalized cannabis was much less pronounced than in the rest of the United States. 129 The different levels and trends in the rates of violent and property crimes across jurisdictions cannot be attributed to the legalization (or not) of cannabis.130 In Canada, overall, crime rates were on the increase until 2019 since 2014, but declined in 2020, although this change may be attributable to the pandemic. 131 The vulnerability of the cannabis trade, as a cash-based business, could also have created incentives for crimes aa F or the UNODC analysis, states that had legalized cannabis included Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.0100200300400500 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Rates per 100,000 population White non-Hispanic Hispanic African-American non-Hispanic Other non-Hispanic Total arrests FiG. 34 Cannabis arr ests rates of juveniles (12-17 years) in Colorado, 2012-2019 Source: Colorado Bureau of Investigation, National Incident-Based Reporting System; Colorado State Demography Office.01002003004005006007008009001,000 2012 2013201420152016201720182019Rate per 100,000 population Men Women44 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022such as burglary, shoplifting and robbery.

In Colorado, the cannabis market increased to over $2 billion, from $1 billion in 2015, while in Washington it peaked at $1.4 billion, and in Oregon it exceeded $1 billion in 2020.135 All state-level jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis impose significant excise taxes on non-medical cannabis sales, along with standard state sales taxes, other local taxes and licensing fees. In 2020, Colorado generated $387 million in state sales taxes from sales of cannabis, California's tax revenue was $1.1. billion and Washington's sales tax revenue from cannabis in 2020 was $91.8 million.

In Uruguay, by February 2022, around 69,000 people of the 158,000 past-month users (estimated in 2018) were accessing cannabis through the legal cannabis market. Thus, the legal market pro - vided cannabis for less than half of regular cannabis users.138 In 2019, the illegal cannabis market was considered to account for about three quarters of cannabis sales in California.139 In other states such as Washington, Colorado and Oregon, among others, where there is no estimate of the size or extent of the illegal market, such markets seem to have continued to operate along - side the legal/regulated cannabis markets.140 Illegal or black markets continue to exist owing, among other reasons, to price disparities between legal and illegal sources due to taxation, the fact that some juris - dictions within states opt out of cannabis legalization measures and because of individuals or groups 200210220230240250260270280290300 -24 -22-20-18-16-14-12-10 -8-6-4 02468 lizaon 050100150200250300350400 2018 2019 2020 2021Retail sales (millions of Canadian dollars) January February March April May June July August September October November DecemberFiG. 43 Monthly cannabis retail sale, Canada, Oc tober 2018-December 2021 Source: Statistics Canada, table sales by province and territory).02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,800 Q4 Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4 2018 2019 2020 2021Millions of Canadian dollars non-medical use: unlicensed Cannabis products for non-medical use: licensedFiG. 44 Household expenditure on cannabis products f or non-medical use, Canada, 2018-2021 Source: Statistics Canada, table 36-10-0124-01 (Detailed household final consumption expenditure), Canada, quarterly.Price per ounce (do llars)48 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022cultivating unlicensed cannabis on public property or organized crime groups trafficking cannabis out of state.141, 142, 143, 144 Big corporations including from the alcohol and tobacco industries are investing in the cannabis industry The size of the overall legal cannabis market in the United States is estimated at $30 billion.145 As further growth potential is projected, there is a growing influ - ence of and investment by large corporations, including the alcohol and tobacco industries, which are investing in the cannabis industry in North America.146 There are concerns, for instance, that the practice of capping licences for cannabis production in some jurisdictions tends to favour those who have been lobbying to create monopolies, while in other places, large corporations investing in the cannabis business are taking a larger market share. Through market dominance, large cor - porations can influence regulatory frameworks to their own benefit and exclude small businesses and artisanal cannabis production.147, 148 Cannabis products with high potency have proliferated In the state-level jurisdictions that have legalized can - nabis in the United States and Canada, there has also been a diversification of cannabis products, methods of use and changes in the potency of the THC contents of the available products. The potency of seized can- nabis flower (the THC content) in the United States has more than doubled since 2000, to around 14 per cent in 2019, but there are products with levels of THC contents of 20 per cent or higher in some jurisdictions that legalized the drug and, in particular, concentrates with much higher potency.149, 150, 151, 152, 153 In Colorado, for instance, while cannabis flower remains the main product sold, there is an increasing share of other cannabis products. 154TABlE 3 A verage THC content per gram of cannabis products sold in Colorado, 2020 Source: '2020 Regulated Marijuana Market Update' (Colorado Department of Revenue, Marijuana Enforcement Division).

The epidemic of non-medical opioid use is now seeing heroin laced with or sometimes entirely replaced by fentanyls. The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids began increasing in 1997, coinciding with an increase in prescriptions of opioids for pain management, particularly for chronic non-cancer-related pain man- agement, and between that year and 2005, the number of such prescriptions surged more than 500 per cent.i Among the factors altering trends of increased initiation into the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids was that such opioids were considered safer than heroin, as they did not carry the stigma of using an \"illicit\" drug and were less affected by fluctuations in qual - ity or dosage. A study carried out in the period 2010-2013 showed that recent new users of opioids were more likely to be older men and women living in less urbanized areas (75 per cent of such users) who had been introduced, in most cases (75 per cent of cases), to opioids through pharmaceutical drugs;ii this stands in contrast to respondents who began using heroin in the 1960s, who were predominantly young men (83 per cent) and whose first opioid used was mostly heroin. Beginning in 2006, a gradual increase in heroin use was observed in parts of the United States, attributed mainly to the availability of cheaper heroin with higher purity and a change in the formulation of pharmaceutical opioids, making them crush-proof and less liable to misuse. The transition from the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids to the use of heroin, especially among young people, has been, in many cases, part of the progression of addiction in a subgroup of users who considered it too costly to maintain their patterns of use and switched to heroin, as they considered the drug more reliably available through drug dealers, more potent and more cost-effective than pharmaceutical opioids. iii Between the periods 2002-2004 and 2011-2013, heroin use increased by 139 per cent among those who self-reported the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids. iv A study that looked at national data for the period 2002-2004 found that, among the population aged 18 and older, heroin users had been 3.9 times more likely to report the non-medical use of opioids in the previous year and 2.9 times more likely to meet the criteria for abuse of or dependence on opioids than people who did not use heroin.v Experience from the United States has shown that, under certain con - ditions, an increase in the availability of heroin at competitive prices can lead to a general increase in heroin use, despite the substance's negative image.vi The increase in the availability of heroin recorded between 2005 and 2018vii was driven by the existing population of misusers of prescription opioids. Following improved controls over the prescribing of pharmaceutical opioids, that group mainly switched to heroin.ii It is estimated that in 2020 9.5 million people in the United States had used opioids non-medically in the past year. Of these, 9.3 million people had used pharmaceutical opioids non-medically, 902,000 people had used heroin, and about 700,000 people had used bothviii heroin and pharmaceutical opioids (non-medical use). In parallel, theer has been a marked increase in post-mortem findings of heroin in cases of death due to drug overdose. ixHowever, most of the recent increases in overdose deaths attributable to heroin in North America seem to be driven by fentanyls that are mixed with heroin by drug dealers or traffickers.x i S arah G.

The World Drug Report 2021 described three different scenarios in the interplay of the use of different opi- oids that play a key role in the dynamics of non-medical opioid use epidemics across countries: >Typically used opioids are substituted with other opioids, or new opioids are experimented with, depending on their price, purity, and effects and side-effects perceived by the user, as well as avail - ability and control measures. a F or a more detailed discussion, see the World Drug Report 2021. >Different opioids are used consecutively or sequen - tially to self-medicate or manage withdrawal, including during opioid agonist b or antagonistc therapy. >Novice or regular users of opioids, and sometimes even primary users of other, non-opioid drugs, are inadvertently exposed to opioids used as adulterants or cutting agents for substances already established in the market. b A ccording to the WHO Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms, an agonist is a substance that acts on neuronal receptors to produce effects similar to those of a reference drug. For example, methadone is an agonist of morphine at the opioid receptors. c A ccording to the WHO Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms, an antagonist is a substance that counteracts the effects of another substance or agent. Pharmacologically, an antagonist interacts with a receptor to inhibit (counter or stop) the action of the substance that produces specific effects mediated by that receptor. Methadone is an opioid agonist, whereas buprenorphine is an agonist partial morphine, opium74 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022global supply of opioids global supply of opiates Opium production remains concentrated in three countries Of the 57 countries where illicit opium production was reported over the last decade, three alone collectively accounted for 97 per cent of estimated illicit opium production in the period 2017-2021. Afghanistan remained by far the world's largest source of opium, accounting for an estimated 86 per cent of global illicit production in 2021. Afghan opium supplies markets all over Eurasia and Africa, and a negligible proportion reaches North America and Oceania. Opium produced in South-East Asia, mostly in Myanmar (6 per cent of global production) and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (about 1 per cent), supplies markets in East and South-East Asia and Oceania, while opium pro - duced in Latin America, mostly in Mexico (close to 6 per cent) and to a more marginal extent in Colombia and Guatemala (less than 1 per cent), accounts for most of the heroin supplied to the United States and the relatively limited heroin markets of South America. Estimated area under opium poppy cultivation decreased in 2020 The global area under opium poppy cultivation decreased by 16 per cent, to 246,800 ha, in 2021, pri- marily owing to a decrease in Afghanistan of 21 per cent, to 177,000 ha,6 although the area under cultiva- tion in that country was still higher than in 2019, and 35 per cent higher than in 2011. 7 The area under opium cultivation in Myanmar increased slightly, by 2 per cent to 30,200 ha, in 2021,8 reversing a trend in which the area had decreased by almost 50 per cent between 2013 and 2020.9 Shan State, border - ing China, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand, continued to be the opium hub for Myanmar, accounting for 82 per cent of the country's total area under poppy cultivation, with most of the rest found in the neighbouring Kachin and Kayah states. 10 No new data for Mexico were available. Data for the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 showed a decrease in the area under opium poppy cultivation of 23 per cent compared with the preceding 12-month period, to 21,500 ha. Data also showed that opium poppy cultivation was concentrated in six states located along or close to the Pacific coast, notably the states of Sinaloa and Chihuahua, in the north, and the state of Guerrero, in the south.11 global opium production increased slightly in 2021 Despit e the decreasing area under opium poppy cul- tivation, global opium production continued its long-term upward trend in 2021, growing 7 per cent year-on-year, to 7,930 tons, less than the peak of 10,240 tons reached in 2017. The increase in 2021 was largely attributable to an increase in opium production in Afghanistan (8 per cent) resulting from a marked increase in opium yields in the country, from 28 kg per ha in 2020 to 38 kg per ha in 2021,12 and thus back to the levels observed in 2019, a year in which neither crop diseases, pests nor droughts were reported in the main poppy growing areas of the country.13 The yield figure in Afghanistan thus continued to be considerably higher than in Mexico (about 21 kg per ha in 2018/19)14 and Myanmar (about 14 kg per ha in 2021),15 although still below reported opium yields from licit opium production.16 Fig. 46 Opium popp y cultivation and production of opium, 1998-2021 Source: UNODC calculations based on UNODC illicit crop monitoring surveys and on responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Seizures of opiates surge to a record high in 2020 Seizures of opiates soared almost 40 per cent in 2020, reaching a new record high.d Seizures of opium increased by 37 per cent, seizures of morphine by 116 per cent and seizures of heroin by 20 per cent. Interceptions of opiates continued a long-term upward trend, with quantities seized more than doubling in the period 2000-2020. The increase in seizures was most pronounced for opium, which is primarily seized close to the main production centres. Interception rates for opium - the percentage of estimated opium produced that was reported seized in the form of opium - rose from 5 per cent in 2000 to 13 per cent in 2020. 21 Over the last two decades, the growth in seizures of opiates (expressed in opium equivalents) has been faster (close to 160 per cent between 2000 and 2020) than the growth in opium production (close to 60 per cent), suggesting that interception rates (the propor - tion seized) have increased. At the same time, data suggest that the quantities of opiates that have not been seized and that are available for consumption have increased during the past two decades, although d Thes e calculations are based on an assumed conversion ratio of 10 kg of opium per 1 kg of morphine or heroin.a lack of accurate data on purity and uncertainty with regard to estimates of heroin manufacture, opiate sei - zures expressed in heroin equivalents, and changes in opiate stocks prevent the calculation of precise figures. Supply of other opioids 2020 shows a decline amid a long-term upward trend Seizures of pharmaceutical opioids have shown an apparent upward trend over the last decade, despite a decrease in reported seizures of 83 per cent in 2020. However, most of the decrease in 2020 is attributable to non-reporting by Member States, notably in West and North Africa (where trafficking in tramadol for non-medical use is a major threat) and Asia (where codeine misuse is widespread).22 Assuming that these non-reporting countries seized, on average, similar quantities of pharmaceutical opioids as in the previous year, the overall decrease in 2020 would be reduced to 14 per cent, and the figures for 2020 would still be among the highest in recent years.Fig. 47 g lobal opium production, 1998-2021, and quantities of opiates seized, 1998-2020 Sources: UNODC, opium surveys in selected countries and responses to the annual report questionnaire; and other government sources.

Both the quantities of tramadol manufactured, and the quantities seized started to decline after the sub- stance was put under improved national control in India in 2018. Nonetheless, trafficking in tramadol did not disappear and partly shifted to the dark web. In 2020, authorities in India announced the first-time dismantling of a major international criminal network trafficking non-medical tramadol and other psychoactive sub - stances on the dark web.e Similarly, a year later, intensified international cooperation helped to identify and interdict global trafficking in tramadol, as well as tapentadol, a newly emerging opioid analgesic that is also not under international control and that appears to have partly displaced tramadol in some markets. f e The s eizures were made under the INCB special intelligence operation named Operation Trance (see https:/ f to Interdict Opioids' Illicit Distribution and Sales (OPIOIDS) project coordinated Operation New Horizons, in which more than 160 officers from 90 agencies and international organizations worked Fig. 48 g lobal quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized, 2010-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. Notes: The data refer to seizures of opioids reported by Member States to UNODC in the former version of the annual report questionnaire, under the category \"pharmaceutical opioids\" . For the new version of the annual report questionnaire, the following categories were used as proxies: seizures of buprenorphine, oxycodone and as well as the general category of pharmaceutical opioids. Not all these substances, however, are necessarily intended for medical use in humans; some are also used in veterinary medicine. Among the fentanyl analogues approved as pharmaceutical drugs for human use are alfentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil and sufentanil. One (carfentanil) is approved for veterinary use. Some Member States also report substances (such as furanylfentanyl) that are, in general, not approved for medical use. Data on seizures for 2020 reported by Member States to UNODC showed a significant decline, which, however, does not necessarily indicate an actual strong decline. In fact, much of the indicated decline is attributable to the lack of reporting by Member States using the new annual report questionnaire, which must be filled in online and thus may constitute a hurdle for some countries. Data identified as \"2020 (estimated)\" refer to likely overall quantities seized, based on the assumption that countries that did not report seizures for the year 2020 may have nevertheless registered seizures in 2020 in quantities similar to those in the previous year. 050100150200 2010 2011201220132014201520162017201820192020Ton equivalents Estimate of phamaceutical opioids TramadolFig. 49 g lobal quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized, adjusted for purity and expressed in S-DDD, 2020 Sources: UNODC calculations based on responses to the annual report questionnaire; INCB, Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2019 (E/INCB/2020/2); and INCB, Psychotropic Substances: Statistics for 2021 - Assessments of Annual Medical and Scientific Requirements (E/INCB/2020/3).

Available data also indicate ongoing displacements among the more potent synthetic opioids, including among the fentanyl-related substances23 and between the fentanyl-related substances and the non-fentanyl synthetic opioids, which have started to replace fen-tanyls in some instances. 24 global use of opioids Opioid use remains high with a slight increase since 2017 Opioid use remains widespread. It is estimated that 61.3 million people (range: 36.5 million-78.1 million) had used opioids in the past year worldwide in 2020. This includes people who use opiates and people who use pharmaceutical opioids for non-medical purposes and corresponds to 1.2 per cent of the global popula- tion aged 15-64. The majority of people who use opioids are men - an estimated 85% based on data from 26 countries. Since 2017, both quantitative and qualitative informa - tion have pointed to a moderate increase in opioid use, with possible stabilization in 2020. Qualitative report - ing suggests that between 2010 and 2017 most countries observed decreases in opioid use. However, it is challenging to confirm long-term trends in opioid use by means of quantitative estimates, since it is not always possible to determine if changes were the result of actual phenomena or merely the result of improved data. For example, global estimates show a sharp increase in use between 2016 and 2017, but this mainly together to identify and interdict global trafficking in tramadol and tapentadol (see https:/ /www.incb.org/incb/en/news/news_2021/incb-operation-new-horizons-identifies-new-traffick-ing-in-tapentadol--an-emerging-synthetic-opioid.html). g S -DDDs refers to \"defined daily doses for statistical purposes\" as defined by INCB.

About half of the users of opioids had used opiates, mainly heroin and opium, in the past year.

Opiate use constitutes part of overall opioid use and follows similar trends. Availability of pharmaceutical opioids for medical consumption Decline after 2013 and stabilization in 2020 The availability of pharmaceutical opioids under inter - national control for medical purposes25 more than doubled in the period 2000-2010 before declining by 15 per cent between 2012 and 2019 and remaining basi- cally stable in 2020. The overall decline after 2012 was primarily driven by declines in North America, where, starting in 2010, state and federal government agen- cies tightened prescribing policy guidelines and monitoring.26 The proportion of opiates among the available phar - maceutical opioids overall rose from 55 per cent in 2000 to 65 per cent in 2014 (mainly reflecting the growing importance of thebaine-based substances such as oxycodone), before declining to 61 per cent by 2020. The increase in recent years in the proportion of synthetic opioids for medical purposes is due to the fact that the decline in the availability of opiates has been more pronounced than the decline in the avail-ability of synthetic opioids. The largest quantities of pharmaceutical opioids avail - able for medical consumption at the global level in 2020, expressed in S-DDD, were codeine (including preparations), followed by hydrocodone (including preparations) hydrocodone, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone and morphine. Codeine accounted for more than two thirds of all preparations of such opioids, expressed in S-DDD, in 2020.27 The decline in the availability of codeine preparations for medical consumption over the last five years (a decline of 30 per cent between 2016 and 2020), was, however, more pronounced than the over - all decline in the availability of opioids, excluding preparations for medical consumption, over the same period (a decline of 10 per cent).28 The availability of methadone and buprenorphine, sub - stances typically used in substitution treatment for heroin dependence, is trending upward, suggesting an increase in the delivery of agonist therapy for drug treatment globally. Worldwide, methadone was more widely available than buprenorphine, except in South Asia and, in very small quantities, in West and Central Africa.

Prevalence levels are highest in North America, South-West Asia, Oce- ania, and South Asia. Owing to population size, the highest estimated number of opioid users live in South Asia, followed by North America. As measured in terms of prevalence, the opioids reported by countries as the most used were heroin (in half (70) of the reporting countries), pharmaceuti - cal opioids for non-medical use (in one quarter (35) of the reporting countries), opium (in 16 countries) and tramadol (in 11 countries).30 Some other pharmaceuti - cal opioids, such as codeine, buprenorphine and fentanyl, were mentioned by a small number of coun- tries in a context of non-medical use. Furthermore, data on the most prevalent opioid in a country may mask significant pockets of users that use other opi- oids. For example, in Czechia, 1.5 per cent of the general population had used pharmaceutical opioids non-med - ically at least once in the past year, but heroin was the most used drug among those seeking treatment.31 There are currently two main dynamically evolving non-medical opioid use epidemics in the world, both driven by the relatively high availability of opioids pro - duced at low cost. One is related to illicitly produced fentanyls, which have been mixed with heroin and other drugs in North America. The second affects North Africa, West Africa, the Near and Middle East and South-West Asia and concerns the non-medical use of tramadol. The opioid crisis in North America has not yet been associated with a sizeable increase in the number of opioid users, although this should be viewed within a context of very high prevalence of opioid use, but it has driven drug overdose mortality to unprecedent heights, owing in part to the high potency of fentanyl and its analogues. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the upward trend in overdose deaths has been further aggravated.

It is not yet associated with a large number of overdose deaths, but it should be noted that no systematic monitoring of drug-related deaths exists in most of the affected countries. However, even if deaths related to tramadol overdose do occur, as evidenced in other regions such as Europe,32 mortality rates associated with tramadol can be expected to be lower than those associated with fentanyls, owing to the dramatically different poten- cies of the two substances.84 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022There likely exist other dynamically evolving non-med- ical opioid use crises, for example, the misuse of codeine or codeine-based preparations in a number of countries, such as the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Zimbabwe,33, 34 but data are scarcer in this regard. Supply of opioids: regional analysis Africa leads in seizures of pharmaceutical opioids; seizures in Asia and North America are also notable Africa reported the largest quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized between 2016 and 2020, accounting for 54 per cent of global quantities seized (in kilogram equivalents), mainly reflecting seizures of tramadol. However, the proportion of global seizures of pharmaceutical opioids effected in Africa clearly decreased during that period. This contrasts with Asia, which saw a marked increase. The main pharmaceutical opioid seized in Asia was codeine. If quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized were adjusted for purity and converted into S-DDD, most of the global seizures of pharmaceutical opioids in recent years would be attributable to North America, reflecting the large- scale seizures of fentanyl and its analogues in the subregion. Seizures of opiates remain concentrated in Asia In 2020, most of the heroin and morphine seized glob - ally was once again seized in Asia, with the amount seized increasing by about 46 per cent compared with the previous year. Figures were boosted by an increase in quantities seized of more than 60 per cent in South- West Asia. In that connection, that subregion, as well as the broader subregion also comprising the Near and MAP 2 Opioids most us ed for non-medical purposes, by country, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. Note: The information is based primarily on the ranking of prevalence of non-medical opioid use confirmed by reported prevalence of non-medical opioid use and, when that was not available, on the ranking or data on treatment of non-medical opioid use reported in the annual report questionnaire. Estimating prevalence on the basis of drug treatment data has its limits, particularly with regard to the non-medical use of drugs such as pharmaceutical opioids, which does not carry the same level of social stigma as that of other drugs and for which users may be less likely to seek treatment.

Other regions reporting an increase in seizures of heroin and morphine were South-Asia and Oceania, but most saw a decline in 2020, including all the sub-regions of Europe, the Americas and Africa. Fig. 61 g lobal quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized and geographical distribution, 2016-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire. Notes: The data refer to seizures of opioids reported by Member States to UNODC in the former version of the annual report questionnaire, under the category \"pharmaceutical opioids\" . For the new version of the annual report questionnaire, the following categories were used as proxies: seizures of buprenorphine, oxycodone and as well as the general category of pharmaceutical opioids. Data on seizures for 2020 reported by Member States to UNODC for 2020 showed a significant decline, which, however, does not necessarily indicate an actual decline. In fact, much of the indicated decline is attributable to the lack of reporting by Member States using the new annual report questionnaire, which must be filled in online and thus may constitute a hurdle for some countries. Data identified as \"2020 (estimated)\" refer to likely overall quantities seized, based on the assumption that countries that did not report seizures for the year 2020 may have nevertheless registered seizures in 2020 in quantities similar to those in the previous year.

However, some readily available indicators offer possibilities for estimating the likely importance of specific regions in the manufacture of morphine and heroin, at least tentatively. This process can vary, but in broad terms, it starts with identifying the locations where the stages of manufacture take place. In the first stage, opium is transformed into morphine, and in the second stage, morphine is transformed into heroin. These stages can, and often do, take place in different countries. The distribution of opium produc-tion, in combination with seizures of morphine, suggests that most of the first stage of heroin manufacture - the transformation of opium into morphine - takes place close to where opium is produced. In the period 2013-2019, the bulk of morphine manufacture took place in South-West Asia (ranging from 83 per cent of total manufacture, based on opium production estimates, to 98 per cent, based on sei-zures of morphine, although this last upper limit likely reflects a low rate of morphine interception in other regions rather than evidence of a manufacturing location), followed by South-East Asia and the Americas. The location where the second stage, converting morphine into heroin, takes place can be estimated on the basis of (a) seizures of morphine, as an indicator of the extent of morphine availability, and (b) the number of detected heroin laboratories. The estimates derived in this way suggest that most processing of morphine into heroin still takes place close to opium production locations, that is, mainly in South-West Asia, followed by South-East Asia, but with some pro - cessing also taking place along principal heroin trafficking routes and a less significant level of processing taking place in consumer countries. The heroin is frequently mixed with cutting agents along trafficking routes and in destination countries. Nonetheless, there are caveats that need to be considered when using these indicators. It should be noted that estimates of the geo-graphical distribution of morphine and heroin manufacture depend on the quality of the indicators used and their relevance in describing the level and location of manufacture. Seizures of morphine, for exam - ple, may be more reflective of law enforcement capacities and priorities than the level of supply. The same is true of the dismantling of heroin laboratories. In addition, the size of dismantled laboratories can differ and may distort the regional distribution of manufacturing. Moreover, the definition of what constitutes a heroin laboratory in the data reported by Member States is extremely broad and includes not only heroin manufacturing laboratories as such, but also facilities where heroin is diluted and cut with other products, facilities where heroin is packaged, places where chemicals used in heroin manufac - ture are stored, and dumping sites. This may inflate the number of reported laboratories and the extent of manufacture, notably in con - sumer regions. Finally, reporting of these indicators is uneven across countries and regions, creating an additional bias. Seizures of mor - phine also strongly fluctuate from year to year but may nevertheless help to provide reasonable estimates over time. However, while each indicator has its shortfalls and biases, and pre- cise percentages of regional manufacturing cannot be calculated, triangulating their information may still provide a reasonably accu- rate picture. i UNODC , World Drug Report 2021, Booklet 3, Drug Market Trends: Opioids, Cannabis (United Nations publication, 2021).HEROIN MANUFACTURE PROCESS Conversion of opium into morphine Note: estimates based on (i) opium production and (ii) morphine seizures Note: estimates based on (i) morphine production and (ii) number of dismantled heroin laboratories Conversion of morphine into heroin Proportion of production that based on UNODC, World Drug Report 2021; and UNODC, estimates of seizures of morphine and of dismantled heroin laboratories based on responses to the annual report questionnaire. 3 OPIOIDS | Regional patterns and trends in opioid markets87Fig. 63 H eroin and morphine seized, by region, 2010-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire Fig. 64 C ountries reporting the largest quantities of opiates seized, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to annual report questionnaire.

There were significant changes in 2020. Seizures of heroin and morphine increased significantly in coun- tries neighbouring Afghanistan, notably in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, but declined in the Balkan countries and in destination countries in West - ern and Central Europe. The principal immediate outlet for opiates produced in Afghanistan seems to be Pakistan, with seizures reported there accounting for close to 29 per cent of all heroin and morphine seized globally in 2020. Some seizures were destined for domestic consumption, some for trafficking to the Islamic Republic of Iran and beyond, and some for trafficking along the southern routeh to either South Asia (4 per cent of global sei - zures), notably India, or to eastern Africa (1 per cent). Another important route, accounting for about 2 per cent of global seizures of heroin and morphine in 2020, runs from South-West Asia to Central Asia and Trans - caucasia and onward to the Russian Federation or Western and Central Europe. For opiates originating in South-East Asia, mainly Myanmar, the main routes run to East Asia, elsewhere in South-East Asia, and Oceania, which together account for 7 per cent of global seizures of heroin and morphine. Routes in the Americas flow from south to north, mainly to the United States, either from Mexico or, to a lesser extent, from South America, notably Colombia, with these two routes accounting for a com- bined 5 per cent of global seizures in 2020. COV i D-19 pandemic has not changed overall trafficking patterns but has had an impact on heroin flows While the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed the Balkan route's status as the most prominent heroin trafficking corridor, it did have an impact on trafficking activities during 2020, before they rebounded in 2021. Some traffickers apparently tried to circumvent the Balkan route to ship heroin during the pandemic, shift - ing flows towards the southern route. This was reflected by the growing number of large seizures of heroin of up to 1.3 tons on the Arabian Sea since the onset of the pandemic and the similarly large seizures made on ships arriving from Western Asia at a number of European ports, such as in the United Kingdom, which was an exception in Western Europe in reporting a marked increase in major seizures in 2020, mainly sourced directly from South-West Asia. h The s outhern route includes trafficking from South-West Asia, notably Pakistan, to South Asia, the Gulf countries, and other countries in the Near and Middle East and Africa.Fig. 65 D istribution of quantities of heroin and morphine seized, by main trafficking routes, 2010-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Based on data provided by African countries using the UNODC annual report questionnaire and on individual drug seizures recorded in the UNODC Drugs Monitoring Platform, overall seizures of heroin reported by coun - tries in Africa showed a year-on-year decline in 2020, but this trend appears to have been reversed in 2021. Patterns and trends in specific subregions South-West Asia Relatively high prevalence of opiate use, with a wide gender gap and pronounced rates of use in rural areas The level of opioid use in the three countries compris - ing South-West Asia is estimated to be well above the global average, with past-year use prevalence levels at almost 3.3 per cent of the adult population aged 15-64 in 2020, or an estimated 7 million users, repre- senting an increase from the 1.1 per cent prevalence estimated for the region in 2010. It is likely that the prevalence of the use of opioids may be even higher than estimated from studies based on self-reporting. For example, in a study of industrial workers in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 3.8 per cent reported that they had used an opioid in the past 30 days, but 14.4 per cent had provided a urine sample that had tested positive for opioids.35 As a subset of opioid use, the prevalence of opiate use in the region is also estimated to be higher than the global average, at approximately 1.8 per cent in the past year, with opium being the pre - dominant opiate used in Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and heroin the predominant opiate used in Pakistan.36 Evidence of the use of other opioids in the region includes the non-medical use of codeine, tramadol and diverted methadone. The prevalence of opium use was estimated at 1.5 per cent among the general population of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2013,37 with higher levels among some population groups, such as students (4 per cent in 2017).38 Furthermore, the popularity of opium has been reported as declining among Iranian youth over the past 30 years.39 Recent opium use among Afghan adults (aged 15+) was estimated to range between 0.5 and 5.7 per cent40 and past-year prevalence was at 2 per cent among high school students aged 15-18 years in the country in 2018. 41 The gender gap in drug use in the region is wider than the gap at global level. For example, a study in the Islamic Republic of Iran estimated the prevalence of opium use among males to be about 13 times higher than among females,42 more than double the global average of 5-6 times. The prevalence of opioid use tends to be highest in rural areas of Afghanistan and in some provinces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. For example, opioid use was detected in 10.1 per cent of the rural population in Afghanistan, three times more than in the population of urban areas, in contrast to the situation in other regions.43 South-West Asia continues to dominate the global supply of opiates South-West Asia accounted for most of the opium pro - duced in the 1990s and has continued to do so since 2002, leading to extremely high levels of trafficking in and seizures of opiates. More than three quarters of all opiates seized worldwide (expressed in heroin equivalents) in 2020 were seized in South-West Asia. Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest opium producer by a substantial margin, with the epicentre Fig. 66 P roportion of South-West Asia in global opium production and global opiate seizures Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Approximately half of all of the opium poppy production in Afghanistan takes place in Helmand province,44 where 20 per cent of all agricultural land is dedicated to the crop.45 What next in Afghanistan? Three potential scenarios following the Taliban's return to power Given that Afghanistan accounted for about 86 per cent of global illicit opium production in 2021, any sudden changes in production in the country would have a major impact on the global supply of opiates. The Taliban's return to power in August 2021 has led to major transformations in Afghanistan, affecting the rule of law, security and socioeconomic development, phenomena that are closely linked with drug produc- tion,46 thus creating at least three opposing scenarios for the potential development of opium production in the country. Scenario 1: an expansion of opium production The first scenario foresees a combination of decreased socioeconomic development and gaps in government resources and skills to control drug production and trafficking (with or without the political will to combat drug-related crime), leading to a drastic or gradual but significant increase in opium production. How likely is the scenario? The erosion of socioeconomic development is already visible and Afghanistan has been facing serious eco - nomic problems, notably the threat of large-scale famine. A report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in October 2021 warned that the number of people facing acute food insecurity in Afghanistan had increased to 22.8 million, or 55 per cent the country's population, during the winter season (the period from November 2021 to March 2022), a consequence of: (a) conflict, which in 2021 added 700,000 people to the 3.5 million Afghans already displaced; (b) severe drought, which affected 25 of the 34 provinces between October 2020 and May 2021; and (c) overall economic decline linked to the freezing of $9.5 billion worth of national assets abroad, devaluation of the national currency, high food prices and mass unemployment.47 These are substantial MAP 8 Opium popp y cultivation in Afghanistan, 2021 Source: UNODC, \"Drug situation in Afghanistan 2021: latest findings and emerging threats\" (November 2021).

The situation has been further aggravated by the fact that development assistance has been largely halted. Until the change in government in August 2021, devel - opment assistance was equivalent to 22 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)48 and for two decades helped to fund education, health care, governance reform and infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, roads, dams and essential infrastructure projects.49 Without such assistance, GDP will fall substantially and the relative importance of the opiate sector for the country's overall economy will thus further increase. The extent of the political will and the capacity to dras - tically reduce opium production and the resources available to do so remains uncertain. In August 2021, the Taliban announced to the media an opium ban, 50 and in April 2022 issued a decree banning all drugs (see below for more details),51 but the impact of this decree remains unclear. Several weeks after the first media announcement against drugs, the Taliban expressed to the media some level of tolerance, at least temporarily, towards opium cultivation as a way to overcome economic hardship. 52, 53 Under the current socioeconomic conditions, there is a definite possibility that in 2022 there will be a large increase in production, initiating a significant expan- sion of the global opiate supply, if other conditions remain unchanged. But the likelihood of a long-term expansion is not only linked to the fate of the socio - economic conditions and governance in Afghanistan but also to the possibility of expanding the global opiate market currently fed by opiates originating in Afghanistan. The decreasing and relatively low price of opium in Afghanistan before the change in govern - ment suggests that the high level of production in recent years had fully met the demand of the global opiate market, such that there may not be much space for a further expansion of the market, unless new des - tination markets are found. Possible impact of the scenario Conclusions on the possible consequences of a sce - nario of growing opium production in Afghanistan can be drawn from the dynamics observed in opiate mar - kets during the last two decades. A sudden major increase in opium production in 2022 would not necessarily entail an immediate increase of similar magnitude in heroin manufacture, although increased opium production would eventually lead to upward trends in heroin manufacturing and traffick - ing.54 Past seizure data have shown that it can take between 1 and 1\u00bd years for opiates originating in Afghanistan to reach destination countries, depending on the distance from Afghanistan and the mode of transport used.i This suggests that an eventual increase in opium production in Afghanistan can be expected, in general, to be reflected, within the same year, in an increase in the supply of opiates in the Near and Middle East and South-West Asia, and a year later in Europe. It can take up to one year for opiates originating in i F or example, there is a good correlation of trends of opium production and opiate seizures made in the regions close to Afghanistan while correlation improves if a one-year time lag is considered for seizures made in regions further away (Africa and Europe).

Past fluctuations in opium production and prices in Afghanistan have shown that opium prices are quite sensitive to production changes. A possible expansion of opium production and consequent heroin manufac - ture would probably trigger a decrease in opium and heroin prices in close proximity to the production areas. Prices at the destination would not be subject to the same level of change, but a large increase in production and associated increased purity and lower prices would likely alter the market by making heroin more accessible. The first to feel the effects of expanded production would be countries neighbouring Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan and Central Asia already suffer from high rates of opiate prevalence and are exposed to what are possibly the largest quantities of opiates trafficked worldwide. India is one of the world's single largest opiate markets in terms of users55 and would likely be vulnerable to increased supply, as there are already signs that an intensification of traf - ficking in opiates originating in Afghanistan may be taking place eastwards, in addition to southwards and westwards along the traditional Balkan route.56 Con - sequences could range from expanded use to increased levels of trafficking and associated organized crime. In addition, there is the question of whether the increased availability of opiates could bring an increased number of heroin overdoses57 and whether increased purity could affect the harm posed by heroin use. The same consequences could be felt later in transit and CHANGES IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN AFGHANISTAN WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON VIRTUALLY ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD Increased numbers of people using opiates Increased frequency of opiate use among existing users Moderate increase in overdose deaths directly related to opiates Increase in opiate tracking and related criminal activities Unchanged levels of opiate use The market reacts to supply and demand Farmers diversify into other crops Decreases in opiate use (although at a lower rate than decreases in opium production) Decreases in opiate-related deaths Decreases in initiation into opiate use, i.e. decreases in new users Replacement of heroin or opium by other substances at the user level, some of which may be even more harmful than heroin or opium (such as fentanyl and its analogues) Possible reductions in opiate-related crime Displacement of opium production to other countriesCONSEQUENCES Production decreaseProduction increase Stable Production3 OPIOIDS | Regional patterns and trends in opioid markets95destination regions such as Eastern Africa and Europe,58 although in recent years increases in heroin use driven by availability have not always been observed in Europe following increased opium production in Afghanistan. The risk in Europe in the short to medium term could prove to be more related to a more harmful use of heroin, with users consuming larger and purer quan- tities of heroin rather than new users being lured into experimenting with heroin.59 Even though the influence of changes in the price of opium in Afghanistan on the price and consumption of heroin in destination countries is expected to be rather moderate, it could be more substantial if major changes in Afghan opium prices take place.j A literature review suggests that a 10 per cent decline in purity-ad - justed heroin prices can translate into an increase of 2.2 to 21 per cent (and most likely between 7 and 11 per cent) in the number of heroin users.60 However, the price of heroin is just one of the many factors that influences heroin use.61 A lower price may not only influence the frequency of use but also the initiation and the number of users, as economic acces - sibility is one of the factors influencing drug use.62, k Increased opium production may influence increases in the purity of street-level heroin more than changes in retail prices and may pose a higher health risk to users as a result of growing unpredictability regarding levels of purity. Although, studies consistently show that purity is only moderately associated with trends in heroin overdose.63 j F ollowing the announced opium poppy ban in Afghanistan in 2000 a subsequent ten-fold increase in opium prices in Afghanistan (between July 2000 and May 2001) resulted in 70 per cent higher purity adjusted heroin prices in Western Europe between the first quarter of 2001 and June 2002.

(National Institute on Drug Abuse), Monitoring the Future, 2020, Volume I Secondary School Students (Ann Arbor, June 2021)).Scenario 2: a new opium poppy ban and/or a substantive reduction in production This scenario considers the possibility of a drastic reduction in opium production in Afghanistan. Two factors could eventually make this possible: an opium ban by the Taliban and a major replacement of the opium economy with a methamphetamine economy. How likely is the scenario? Both factors explored in the scenario have some level of plausibility; the Taliban already introduced an effec - tive opium production ban in 2000 for the year 2001,64 and the expanding manufacture of methamphetamine in Afghanistan65 could at least partially substitute for the opium economy if the conditions underlining meth - amphetamine manufacture and trafficking were different than opium. The Taliban already announced to the media a ban on drug production and trafficking upon retaking power in August 2021, 66 and on 3 April 2022, issued a decree announcing that the cultivation of opium poppy was prohibited across the country, as well as the produc - tion, use or transportation of other narcotic drugs.67 Given that the opium poppy in Afghanistan was already in the field and almost ready to be harvested at the time the decree was issued in April, it is unlikely that the ban will have an impact on the production of opium in 2022, but it could have a sizable impact on future production if the political will and capacity to enforce it are in place.Possible consequences of increased levels of opium production in Afghanistan in countries supplied by opiates originating in Afghani-stan: >Increased numbers of people using opiates >Increased frequency of opiate use among existing users >Moderate increase in overdose deaths directly related to opiates >Increase in opiate trafficking and related criminal activities 96 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Fig. 68 F arm-gate price of dry opium and price of high-quality heroin in Afghanistan, January 2017-August 2021 Sources: Afghanistan, Ministry of Interior Affairs, \"Afghanistan drug price monitoring monthly report\" (June 2021), and previous years and UNODC, Drug situation in Afghanistan 2021 (November 2021). Possible impact of the scenario A long-term effect of a drastic and sustainable reduc- tion of opium production in Afghanistan could affect opioid production outside Afghanistan. The estab - lished global demand of heroin would likely call for a supply of heroin or other opioids to compensate for lost Afghan production. Such supply could potentially be met with increased or new cultivation of opium poppies in other countries, or with an increase of illic - itly produced synthetic opioids. The licit supply of opium for medical purposes would be too small (about 280 tons) if diverted to replace the current large illicit opium production in Afghanistan (6,800 tons). One of the first visible impacts of a sudden decrease in opium production (or the expectation of a sudden decrease) would be on the processing and price of opium. Opium prices reacted immediately to the decree of April 2022, as they did in anticipation of a possible sudden limitation in the supply of opium when the Taliban took power in 2021. Farm-gate prices doubled between May 2021 and August 2021.68 Once it became clear that there was a certain level of tolerance of opium cultivation, 69, 70 prices gradually reversed,71 increasing again around the time when the decree of April 2022 was issued, in reaction to a possible future shortage of opium. Afghanistan has already experienced in the past a sudden decrease in opium production and the conse- quences of the recent opium ban in Afghanistan could resemble the situation after the ban of 2000, although that ban was short-lived. At the time, the ban was de facto limited to the areas under the control of the Tal- iban, which included the main opium-growing provinces of Helmand and Kandahar in the south and Nangarhar in the east, although it did not include the province of Badakshan in north-eastern Afghanistan which was at the time controlled by the Northern Alliance. The earlier ban came four years after the Taliban had assumed power and took place in stages; firstly, a decree was issued in 1999 to curb opium poppy culti- vation by one third,72 and that was followed a year later by another decree fully banning opium poppy cultiva - tion in 2001. Following those decrees, the area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan decreased by, respectively, 10 per cent in 200073 and 90 per cent in 2011, and by almost 100 per cent in Taliban-controlled areas.74 In contrast to cultivation of opium, trade in the sub - stance was not banned and trafficking in opiates became more profitable, owing to the sharp increase in opiate prices. The opium ban of 2001 was enforced for one year; the resulting market shock was short-lived and was felt more in Afghanistan than elsewhere. Seizures of heroin linked to opiates originating in Afghanistan exhibited a smooth decline in the years following 2001, suggest - ing that the effects of the drastic decline in opium cultivation and production in Afghanistan were smoothly absorbed along the trafficking chain.75 Left without viable alternatives, farmers were hit hard - est by the ban, losing a key source of income,76 and the significant increase in opium production after 2001 was in part due to their attempts to alleviate their debt burden.77 The economic consequences of any new opium poppy ban would probably be even more sig - nificant for farmers than in 2001.

The gross income of farmers from opium was estimated at about $150 million per year ($250 million in 2021 constant United States dollars78) between 1994 and 2000 and reached a high of between $180 million and $250 mil- lion in 1999 ($292-$407 million in 2021 constant United States dollars)79, equivalent to some 5 per cent of Afghan GDP . In the following years, farmers' income from opium varied according to the level of opium production and opium prices and reached $425 million in 2021.80 In 2019, opium cultivation generated 191,000 full-time jobs in Afghanistan, and beyond cultivation and production, heroin manufacture and opiate traf - ficking generated a large economy; overall income from the opiate sector in Afghanistan amounted to between $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion in 2021, equivalent to between 6 and 11 per cent of GDP .81 Any significant expansion of methamphetamine man - ufacture as a substitute for opium cultivation could potentially shift the illegal drug economy - but only if policies and capacities are concentrated exclusively on banning opium production and trade - although the distribution of profits would likely not be the same, as farmers would potentially lose out while other actors would make gains. The decree of April 2022 targets the production of and trade in all drugs, includ - ing methamphetamine, and a ban on the Ephedra plant, the main precursor used in the manufacture of meth- amphetamine in Afghanistan, was already announced by the Taliban in December 2021, leading, according to media sources, to a doubling of the wholesale prices of methamphetamine.82 It still remains to be seen if Fig. 69 Ar ea under opium poppy cultivation and level of opium production in Afghanistan, 1994-2021 Sources: UNODC, \"Drug situation in Afghanistan 2021: latest findings emerging threats\" (November 2021); and UNODC and Afghanistan, \"Afghanistan opium survey 2020: cultivation and production - executive summary\" (April 2021). 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 040,00080,000120,000160,000200,000240,000280,000320,000360,000 1994 199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 Production (southern Afghanistan) unweighted averageFig. 70 P rice of dry opium collected from traders in Afghanistan, August 1997-December 2006 Source: UNODC, World Drug Report 2007 (Vienna, 2007).98 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022opium and methamphetamine will be targeted differ - ently in practice. Outside of Afghanistan, the impact of reduced pro - duction would probably be felt gradually, but would still be significant for final consumers. While Afghan farmers do not seem to keep significant quantities of opium in stock after harvest,83 inventories along the trafficking chain would likely be able to cushion the impact of reduced supply for one or two years.84, 85 The effects of any longer-term reduction would be felt more sharply. The impact on countries in closer proximity to Afghan- istan would be more immediate and larger. The Islamic Republic of Iran was immediately affected by the ban of 2001, which resulted quickly in reduced availability and increased prices. As coping strategies, some users of opium switched to heroin and users of heroin switched from inhaling to injecting.86 Even though, in comparison with the early 2000s, the country now has an increasing number of people enrolled in long-term opioid agonist treatment programmes87 and a broad range of interventions to mitigate the health conse - quences of drug use,88 the impact of a sudden reduction in the supply of opiates could be problematic for opiate users. Further afield, in destination countries, reduced heroin availability was observed following the ban of 2001, although it was far from equivalent to the decline in opium production of about 94 per cent. In those coun - tries, the initial impact of a new ban would be softer, and it would take longer to be fully felt. The ban of 2001 brought some sharp price fluctuations in desti- nation countriesl but they were quickly reversed, as opium production in Afghanistan increased again sig - nificantly in 2002. The dynamics of opiate use in Western Europe were affected by the opium ban of 2001 in Afghanistan to some extent with the heroin market completely collapsing in Estonia and Finland and a subsequent long-term decrease in new demands l While opium pric es rose tenfold in Afghanistan, in countries neighbouring Afghanistan prices rose four to five times and heroin prices in these countries rose two to three times. Increases of heroin retail prices in Western Europe were far more moderate (some 20 per cent), although, taking purity changes into account, the increase of purity adjusted heroin retail prices reached 70 per cent. (Thomas Pietschmann, \"Price-Setting Behaviour in the Heroin Market,\" Bulletin on Narcotics LVI, Nos. 1 and 2 (2004).for treatment due to heroin and an aging population of opioid users in the subregion suggesting low recruit - ment into heroin use.89 However, other factors may also have played a role.90 Elsewhere in Europe, the ban of 2001 appears to have led to the collapse of some local heroin markets, with other opioids taking the place of heroin, for example, fentanyl in Estonia and buprenorphine in Finland.91 This scenario could play out again under any future ban, given that the manufacture of synthetic opioids, nota - bly fentanyl analogues, has become far more widespread over the last three decades. Another sudden disruption in the supply of heroin showed the potential of decreasing health-related harms. When Australia experienced sudden and dra - matic decreases in the availability of heroin in early 2001, the results were increased prices and decreased purity,92 together with a reduction in fatal and non-fa- tal heroin overdoses by 40-85 per cent, as well as an overall reduction in acquisitive crime committed by drug users.93 The year of this disruption was largely only coincidentally related to the opium ban in Fig. 71 Drug -related overdose deaths in the European Union, 1985-2019 , (based on data from selection B and complemented, in case of missing data, with data from selection D) (available at www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2021_en); and EMCDDA, Annual Report 2003: The State of the Drugs Problem in the European Union and Norway (Lisbon, October 2003).

Scenario 3: no significant change in opium production in Afghanistan If policy interventions and socioeconomic conditions do not see major changes, the opium market in Afghan - istan is likely to follow the dynamics of supply and demand. How likely is the scenario? Trends in opium market indicators, such as high levels of opium production, falling opium prices (before the spike due to the political instability in 2021) and a stable number of users of opiates, all suggest that the opium market in Afghanistan may be close to satura- tion.94 Unless new markets for opiates originating in Afghanistan emerge or existing markets are more aggressively targeted with supply-driven expansions, the level of opium cultivation and production may not noticeably change. Possible impact of the scenario Opium price, both alone and in comparison, with the price of other legal crops, is one of the decisive factors in the level of cultivation since high prices provide a greater incentive to farmers to choose opium over other crops. Periods of significant increases in opium production, such as the one observed in recent years in Afghanistan, have repeatedly been followed by sig - nificant decreases in opium prices, which in turn have reduced the incentive for farmers to cultivate opium poppy. Thus, opium market dynamics alone could result in a declining production. The devaluation of the Afghan afghani in 2021 has increased prices for all imported goods and could further reduce incentives for opium production, as alternative crops could become more attractive. The improved security situation in Afghanistan is also providing farmers with increased opportunities to sell agricultural products at markets. Selling opium has always been easier for farmers because buyers come directly to the farm, while other agricultural products need to be sold at markets. South-East Asia East and South-East Asia: opioids likely playing a small or decreasing role in drug demand, except in Myanmar and Viet Nam The estimated prevalence of opioid use in East and South-East Asia is relatively low by global average. In 2020, 0.2 per cent of the population in the region aged 15-64 had used an opioid in the past year, correspond - ing to 3.1 million users. The estimated prevalence has remained relatively stable since 2010, when it was 0.3 per cent. However, for most countries in the region, recent national survey data are not available, which makes it difficult to understand the actual overall level of opioid use. In the period 2019-2020, opioid users formed a size- able proportion of persons treated for drug use disorders in Myanmar (almost 90 per cent), Viet Nam, Possible consequences of unchanged levels of opium production: >Unchanged levels of opiate use >The market reacts to supply and demand >Farmers diversify into other cropsPossible consequences of decreased levels of opium production for countries supplied with opium and heroin are: >Decreases in opiate use (although at a lower rate than decreases in opium production) >Decreases in opiate-induced deaths >Decreases in initiation into opiate use, i.e. decreases in new users >Replacement of heroin or opium by other sub - stances at the user level, some of which may be even more harmful than heroin or opium (such as fentanyl and its analogues) >Possible reductions in opiate-related crime100 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Fig. 73 T rends in registered drug users, China, 2010-2020 Source: China, National Narcotics Control Commission, Report on Drug Control in China, different years in the period 2010-2020.China (approximately 40 per cent), and Malaysia (36 per cent). The proportion was lower in Singapore (14.7 per cent), and opioids played a relatively minor role in drug treatment in other countries in the region (less than 5 per cent of those treated).95 Myanmar and Viet Nam have reported increasing numbers of people Fig. 72 T rends in drug treatment in Myanmar, 2015-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

Regarding the type of opioid used, the most prevalent opioid used among high-risk drug users in the region was, by far, heroin, followed by opium. The non-med- ical use of methadone, codeine and morphine was also reported, and Timor-Leste reported non-medical use of tramadol as the most prevalent opioid in use. In China, data from the national register of drug users suggest a decrease in the importance of opioids (mainly heroin) and an increase in the importance of amphet - amines among registered users over the last 10 years. However, the course of this trend in 2020 is unclear, as fewer drug users were identified by the Chinese authorities in that year, owing to disruptions in the availability of controlled drugs related to the COVID- 19 pandemic.96 The single most used drug by registered users of opioids in China was heroin. There is also evi- dence of the non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids. For example, in a large national school survey 3 OPIOIDS | Regional patterns and trends in opioid markets101in 2017, 2.1 per cent of studentsm reported the non-med- ical use of pharmaceutical opioids, a category including codeine, \"liquorice tablets\" (containing opium), trama - dol hydrochloride and diphenoxylate, in the past year and 0.6 per cent were frequent users.97 Drug use among the young population is typically higher than among the general population. A nationwide wastewater anal - ysis-based study conducted in 30 cities across China found no evidence of significant non-medical use of fentanyl or tramadol until 2019. Levels of use identified were generally low and corresponded to medical prescription practices.98 Another study concluded that heroin use had remained largely stable throughout 2019, although higher levels of use were observed in south-western, central and north-western China. On the basis of correlation analysis, polydrug use patterns involving the use of heroin with cocaine were assumed.99 Europe: no increase in the number of new opioid users, while majority of the estimated aging users are likely in drug treatment The estimated prevalence of opioid use in Europe is lower than the global average, standing at 0.7 per cent of the population aged 15-64, or 3.6 million users of opioids. Within the region, the Eastern and South-East - ern European subregion has a slightly higher estimated prevalence (0.8 per cent) than Western and Central Europe (0.6 per cent). The vast majority of opioid users in Europe are users of opiates, with a prevalence of 0.6 per cent. In other words, 3.1 million of the 3.6 mil- lion opioid users in Europe were estimated to have used opiates in 2020. According to drug treatment and survey data, the most used opioid by far is heroin, although among the gen- eral populations of some countries, the level of non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids is higher than the level of use of heroin. Among high-risk opioid users in some countries, other opioids have been dom- inant, for example, buprenorphine in Finland and, until recently, fentanyl in Estonia. Diverted opioid substitution treatment medications, such as buprenorphine or methadone, are the second most prevalent group of opioids used non-medically, m S tudents were attending 7th-12th grade and their mean age was 15.2 years (SD+-1.8).andn the presence of illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids has also been reported.100 The non-medical use of tramadol and fentanyl has been reported in the region, albeit on a relatively limited scale.101 Tramadol causes hundreds of deaths each year, but they are typ - ically concentrated in a few countries.102 While the use of fentanyl seems to be declining in Estonia, other opi - oids are becoming more prevalent, such as the potent n R eferences to Kosovo shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).Fig. 74 F irst-time entrants into opioid treatment in Bulletin 2021\" .

New admissions to drug treatment for opioid use dis - orders have been declining since 2010, mainly in Western and Central Europe and the Russian Federa- tion, but also in South-Eastern Europe since 2015. Among heroin users entering treatment in the Euro- pean Union, 19 per cent were women.105 Of the population of high-risk opioid users in the Euro - pean Union (estimated at about 1 million people, or 0.35 per cent of the population aged 15-64 in 2019),106 the majority are in some form of drug treatment, most typically opioid substitution treatment (more than half a million in 2019). An additional 2-17% receive other types of drug treatment.107 Drug-related deaths have been moderately increasing over the medium term and have stabilized in recent years. The increase is almost completely explained by aging among this vul - nerable group.108 Even if there is currently no evidence of an increase in the initiation into opioid use, moni- toring systems may be less sensitive to new initiates109 or may register their existence with certain delays. In the Russian Federation, although the share of people entering treatment for opioid use disorders for the first time continues to decline, opioids remain the pri - mary type of drugs used by the majority of all patients treated in the country. Persons treated for opioid dependence are in general, chronic, long-term users; in 2020, such persons outnumbered first-time entrants into treatment for opioid use by 34 to 1. In 2020, opioid-related deaths in Europe did not exhibit the sharp increase observed in North America. How- ever, some countries and territories did report increases, albeit in line with longer-term trends.

Some Euro - pean countries, among them Germany, reported decreases. North America: opioid-related deaths increased to an unprecedented high level during the COV i D-19 pandemic The estimated prevalence of opioid use in North Amer - ica is high in comparison with the global average, with an estimated 3.4 per cent of the population aged 15-64 years reporting past-year opioid use and 0.7 per cent reporting use of opiates in 2020. This translates to 11 million past-year opioid users and 2.4 million past-year users of opiates in the subregion. According to a national household survey, in 2020,o it is estimated that 9.5 million people in the United States had used opioids non-medically in the past year. Of these, 9.3 million people had used pharmaceutical opi - oids in a manner not according to a doctor's prescription, 902,000 people had used heroin, and about 700,000 people had used both pharmaceutical opioids for non-medical purposes and heroin.115 How- ever, taking into account general methodological considerationsp and other sources using indirect esti- o The US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) advises to exercise caution when comparing the 2020 estimates with previous years' estimates due to the necessary methodological changes (differing periods of data collection, online data collection and changes in the questionnaire) in the data collection process related to the pandemic situation. Therefore, the comparability of the 2020 data collection round with the previous rounds is unknown (https:/ /www.samhsa.gov/data/release/2020-national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-re-leases). p Some populations of intensive opioid users may be outside of the sampling frame - either institutionalized in prisons or residential drug treatment facilities, not living at a steady address, or less willing to respond to the survey.Fig. 77 P eople in drug treatment with dependence syndrome diagnosis, by type of drug used, Russian Federation, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.

The 2020 national household survey117 included a question on the misuse of fentanyl products. Based on the responses provided, it was esti- mated that 0.1 per cent of people aged 12 or older (or 356,000 people) had misused those products. How - ever, users may be unaware that they are using fentanyls because they are mixed to varying degrees with other drugs. Since 2013, the United States has been facing an unprecedented rise in overdose deaths, predominantly driven by fentanyls, while the role of heroin has declined. Other, non-fentanyl synthetic opioids (e.g. isotonitazine and brorphine) have also been observed in small, but rising proportions.118 The relative slowdown of the rising trend in overdose deaths between 2017 and 2019 coincided with a relative lack of availability of carfentanil at that time,119 however, other factors may have played a role too. The current rise of fentanyls is considered to be predominantly driven by supply rather than demand. Fentanyls on the United States drugs market have been generally sold as \"heroin\" , identified as \"fentanyl-adulterated or substituted heroin (FASH)\" . There are several market factors that facilitate this, for example, fentanyls are inexpensive, can be produced efficiently, and can be sold on online markets.120 More recently, demand for fentanyl has been created as a result of its high potency and low price and the fact that, owing to its intense onset, the user experiences euphoria that may have been lost owing to the development of tolerance to heroin. As tolerance increases with use of fentanyl-laced heroin or fentanyl, other products on the market become insufficient to satisfy users' opioid requirements.121 Women constituted approximately 30 per cent of all drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2020. Similarly, 29 per cent of all deaths involving any opioid Fig. 79 T rends in past-year use of heroin and non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids, as reported in household surveys, United States, 2010-2020 Source: United States, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, results from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed Tables (Rockville, Maryland, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2021).0.00.51.01.52.0 2010 20122014201620182020 Heroin: number HeroinFig. 80 T rends in opioid overdose deaths by main drug type (considered alone or in combination with other substances), United States, 2010-2020 Sources: United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER, https:/ at https:/ /nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Overdose_data_1999-2020_1.5.22.xlsx includes all categories of opioid overdose deaths.

The proportion of women in deaths involving heroin was slightly lower (25 per cent), but women constituted almost half of all deaths in cases involving the presence of pharmaceutical opioids with - out synthetic opioids other than methadone (47 per cent).122 On the basis of a national survey conducted in Canada in 2019, it was estimated that 1 per cent of Canadians aged 15 years or older had engaged in \"problematic use of opioid pain relievers\" in the past year. Canada has also been experiencing an increasing trend in drug-induced overdose deaths related to the prolifer - ation of synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl. Fentanyl was found in 86 per cent of the samples of people who had died as a result of opioid overdose in the first half of 2021123. In the majority of cases of drug overdose death in British Columbia since 2017, the route of drug administration was smoking, as opposed to injecting, which has had a diminishing role in overdose deaths.124 This is contrary to data observed elsewhere, where injecting has been strongly associated with the risk of dying from overdose.125 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the upward trend in opioid-related (mainly fentanyls-related) overdose mortality has further accelerated in North America.126 In the United States, the number of deaths related Fig. 81 T rends in overdose deaths attributed to pharmaceutical opioids and heroin, United States, 2010-2020 Source: United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemio- logic Research (CDC WONDER), \"Multiple cause of death 2000-2020\" .02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,00016,00018,000 2010 2011201220132014201520162017201820192020NumberPharmaceutical opioids Deaths involving pharmaceutical opioids and other synthetic opioids (fentanyls) Deaths involving pharmaceutical opioidswithout other synthetic opioids 02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,00016,00018,000 2010 2011201220132014201520162017201820192020NumberHeroin Deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids Deaths involving opioid overdose deaths in Canada, by quarter, 2016-2021 Source: Special Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses, Opioid- and Stimulant-related Harms in Canada (Ottawa: Public Health Agency of Canada, December 2021).

Wastewater moni- toring programmes have suggested increased fentanyl consumption in the Canadian cities of Edmonton, Hal - ifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver since the onset of the pandemic.129 The reasons for these increases are not fully under - stood and they are being investigated. Among possible hypotheses is the spreading of fentanyls into new geo - graphical areas of the United States,130 while another possible factor is the observed sharp increase in occur - rences of falsified pharmaceutical drugs containing fentanyl and methamphetamine.131 There are probably also factors related to aggravated racial132 and social health disparities.133 Conditions created by the COVID- 19 pandemic may also have played a role. Social distancing measures leading to decreased access to in-person treatment or using opioids more often while alone may also have been associated with the increas - ing level of overdoses.134, 135The opioid crisis was recognized as a public health emergency in April 2016 by the Provincial Health Offi - cer of British Columbia, Canada, and in 2017 by the Government of the United States. Both countries have introduced novel ways to combat the crisis. Canada has been testing fentanyl-assisted substitution treat - ment as a treatment for fentanyl dependence,136 as well as a new \"safe supply\" programme aimed at substitut - ing the high-risk illicit supply with pharmaceutical-grade opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines in drug users testing positive for COVID-19 or at risk of it, with a view to reducing their risks of poisoning, withdrawal, and exposure to COVID-19.137 But despite these efforts, overdose deaths have continued to increase, suggest - ing that market dynamics have a stronger foothold in driving patterns of harm. Opioids currently do not play a major role in drug use in Mexico, where the latest general population-level data available are from 2016, when 0.1 per cent of pop- ulation aged 12-65 reported heroin use in the past year. Although heroin was the most injected drug in the country in 2020, followed by acetylated opium, opioids only play a minor role in drug treatment admissions. However, a relatively high prevalence of heroin use has been documented near Mexico's northern border with the United States.138 Heroin use in this region has Fig. 83 T rends in substances found in opioid over - dose deaths in Canada, 2016-2021 Source: Public Health Agency of Canada, Apparent Opioid and Stimulant Toxicity Deaths.

Other risk factors exist in Mexico that may con - tribute to increases in opioid use in the future, such as production and trafficking of heroin, trauma related to deportation, and changing opioid-prescription prac - tices.140 Moreover, similarly to other countries in North America, the lacing of heroin with fentanyl has been documented close to Mexico's northern border.141 Tramadol misuse in regional epidemics: North Africa, West and Central Africa, the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia Tramadol is a synthetic opioid used in pain manage - ment of moderate to severe pain, though it also has a mood enhancement effect. Administration of higher than therapeutic doses of tramadol leads to a similar dependence profile to that of morphine and other opi - oids, although the abuse potential in earlier epidemiological studies had been reported as lower than other opioids.142 Adverse effects include dizziness, nausea, constipation and headache and withdrawal symptom include, apart from the typical opioid with- drawal symptoms, also hallucinations, paranoia, confusion and sensory abnormalities.143 The non-med- ical use of the substance is predominantly oral. Tramadol is not internationally controlled. However, national control mechanisms are often in place; in most countries, medical tramadol is a prescription-only medicine. Despite the limited data available on drug use in gen- eral, it is clear that the non-medical use of tramadol has become more prevalent in North and West Africa, the Near and Middle East, and parts of South-West Asia in the last 10 years, with signs of increase, espe- cially in the medium term. Numerous countries have reported evidence of non-medical use of the drug, 144, 145, 146 with Algeria, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Iraq, the Niger, Nigeria, Qatar, Sierra Leone and Togo reporting tra - madol to be the most used opioid substance in their territory. Other countries with evidence of non-med- ical use of tramadol were Ghana, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco,147 Saudi Arabia, the State of Palestine, the United Arab Emirates148 and Yemen.149 Prevalence data regarding the misuse of tramadol in the general populations of the respective countries are scarce but do exist. It was estimated that in Nige-ria, in 2017, there were 4.6 million non-medical users of pharmaceutical opioids, of whom 3 million were men. Of the non-medical users of pharmaceutical opi - oids, most had used tramadol and, to a lesser extent, codeine, or morphine, in the past year, representing 4.7 per cent of the adult population aged 15-64. The prevalence was 3.3 per cent among women and 6 per cent among men. A total of 20 per cent of pharmaceu- tical opioid users met self-assessed International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) criteria for dependence.150 In Egypt, an esti - mated 3 per cent of the adult population used tramadol non-medically in 2016.151 A review study conducted in the Islamic Republic of Iran derived a pooled estimate of 4.9 per cent of past-year non-medical use of TABLE 8 E stimated prevalence and number of users of opioids and opiates in selected subregions, 2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.: use Opiate use Prevalence (percentage)Number of users (millions)Prevalence (percentage)Number of users (millions) North Africa 1.1 1.6 1.1 1.6 West and Central Africa 2.4 6.9 0.2 0.5 Near and Middle East/South-West Asia 3.2 10.5 1.8 5.8108 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022tramadol among males and 0.8 per cent among females.152 Similar levels of use were estimated among the student population (4.8 per cent and 0.7 per cent among male and female students, respectively). Reg - ular non-medical use and dependence on the substance was also documented in the Islamic Republic of Iran, along with other negative health consequences. It was estimated that 13.1 per cent of non-fatal drug poison-ings and 5.7 per cent of fatal drug poisonings was due to tramadol.153 In a 2018 study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 8.6 per cent of high school and college students reported non-medical tramadol use.154 There are several factors at play in the wide geograph - ical spread and relatively high prevalence of tramadol use in these regions. Besides the usual factors that affect drug use, a factor reported across study popu- lations is the use of tramadol to enhance sexual stamina in men.155 Another common reason for trama - dol use among workers and young people is the perception that tramadol use leads to higher energy levels and improvement of performance.156 Tramadol's relatively easy availability in pharmacies and on the illicit market, low cost and the perception of tramadol as safe because it is a prescription medication also play a role.157 Some professions seem to be particularly affected by a high prevalence of non-medical use of tramadol. Studies among farmers and commercial drivers in Ghana found prevalence levels of tramadol misuse of 25-28 per cent.158 The non-medical use of tramadol was notably high among workers in an industrial area in Egypt, where between 25 and 92 per cent of workers interviewed had misused tramadol.159 In a study con - ducted in Nigeria, 19 per cent of bus drivers interviewed reported common misuse of tramadol.160 The problematic non-medical use of tramadol is visible in the high share of people entering drug treatment for tramadol use disorders. Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates specifically mentioned tra- madol as one of the most frequently occurring primary drugs used by people in drug treatment.161 Significant numbers have also been reported in other countries, including the Niger, Liberia and Sierra Leone, some of which have reported recent sharp increases in the demand for treatment for tramadol use disorders.162 Fig. 85 P eople in treatment for tramadol and heroin use disorders in West Africa, 2016-2019 Source: West African Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (WENDU) Report: Statistics and Trends on Illicit Drug Use and Supply 2014-2017 (2019) and West African Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (WENDU) Report: Statistics and Trends on Illicit Drug Use and Supply 2018-2019 (2021).0246810121416 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 Tramadol VerdeBenin Cote d'IvoreGambia Ghana Guinea Liberia Liberia: Rates per 100 000 populationRates per 100 000 population 2016 2017 2018 20193 OPIOIDS | Regional patterns and trends in opioid markets109Are opioid crises spreading beyond regional hotspots? Tramadol beyond Africa and the Middle East The non-medical use of tramadol is reported by several countries outside the hotspots of West, Central and North Africa and the Middle East, although, in terms of seizures, seizures of tramadol in Asia and Europe are relatively small. In 2020, 9 countries in Asia reported seizures amounting to a total of 1.2 tons of tramadol, with India accounting for all but 39 kg.163 In 2019, India reported seizures amounting to 144 kg, with six other countries reporting combined seizures amounting to 70 kg. In Europe, a total of approximately 96 kg of tramadol was seized by 17 countries in 2020, with the majority seized in Sweden (49 kg) and the Russian Federation (33 kg). Wastewater analysis in China estimated the average consumption of tramadol in 2016 at 39.7 mg per day per 1,000 population and 34.8 mg per day per 1,000 population in 2017.164 The study's authors found signif - icant decreases in tramadol use in megacities between 2016 and 2019. The most likely source of tramadol in China was considered to be tramadol obtained by means of medical prescription, although it could not be concluded if the use of the substance was non-med - ical in nature.165 Other countries in South Asia and South-East Asia that reported some indications of the non-medical use of tramadol were Malaysia166, 167 Bhutan, India, Myanmar,168 Nepal, Sri Lanka,169 the Republic of Korea170, q and Thai - land.171 Seizures also point to misuse in Armenia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.172 In the United States, tramadol ranks fourth among all pharmaceutical opioids in terms of non-medical use,173 with approximately 1.5 million people or 0.5 per cent of the population aged 12 years and older reporting the non-medical use of the substance in 2020. The non-medical use of tramadol, relative to other pharmaceutical opioids, remains low in Europe.174 The Global Drug Survey, an online survey of mostly young people across 22 countries, mainly in Europe, reported a past-year prevalence of tramadol use of 6.4 per cent.175 A four-country study conducted in Germany, q In thr ee wastewater treatment plants in the Republic of Korea, in 2018 the mean estimated consumption of tramadol was 27.5 mg per day per 1000 population and 1.7 times higher than the consumption rates found in 2013.Fig. 86 Seizur es of tramadol in Asia, 2018-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000 01020304050607080 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 KilogramsKilograms Armenia Uzbekistan China Indonesia Myanmar Lebanon Bhutan Tajikistan Saudi Arabia Iraq India01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000 01020304050607080 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 KilogramsKilograms Armenia Uzbekistan China Indonesia Myanmar Lebanon Bhutan Tajikistan Saudi Arabia Iraq India020406080100120140 2018 2019 2020Kilograms Sweden United Kingdom Austria Turkey Czechia Bulgaria Greece Norway Ukraine Latvia Gibraltar Estonia Hungary Ireland Lithuania Luxembourg Russian Federation UkraineFig. 87 Seizur es of tramadol in Europe, 2018-2020 Source: UNODC, responses to the annual report questionnaire.110 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom using data from a multi-indicator analysis in the period 2015-2018 assessed the extent of the misuse among the general population of tramadol compared with other common pharmaceutical opioids and reported that codeine had the highest rate of misuse by adults and oxycodone the lowest. With the exception of Spain, the non-med - ical use of tramadol ranked second among pharmaceutical opiates in each country.176 In Europe, each year, hundreds of overdose deaths attributed to tramadol are reported, but such reports are typically concentrated in a few countries.177 In 2019/20, more than 300 overdose deaths attributed to tramadol were reported across the region. Most of the overdose deaths attributed to tramadol were reported in the United Kingdom.178 In England and Wales, overdose deaths attributed to opioids have been increasing over the past three decades, and in 2020, 2,263 overdose deaths attributed to opioids were reported, 9 per cent of which were attributed to tramadol. About 70 per cent of overall opioid overdose deaths reported were among men. In 2020, however, the gender difference with regard to tramadol over - dose deaths was less marked, as the percentage of such deaths among men dropped to 60 per cent.179 Deaths in England and Wales related to fentanyl ana- logues were recorded only in 2017 and 2018. In Norway, pooled data on overdose deaths for the period 2000-2019 indicated more than 3,000 deaths attributed to opioid overdose.180 Between 2003 and 2019, the number of such deaths remained relatively stable, while over the same period, overdose deaths attributed to heroin declined. That was offset by an increase in overdose deaths attributed to pharmaceu - tical opioids, including fentanyls and tramadol, which have accounted for 3 per cent or more of the overdose deaths recorded since 2000. While overall opiate-re- lated overdose deaths were more common among men, opioid overdose deaths, including those attributed to fentanyl and tramadol, were more common among women. Fentanyls beyond North America The use of fentanyls has been reported by several coun - tries, although, currently, there are no indications of an epidemic of non-medical use and its related health 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,800 Oral Injection Oral Injection Oral Injection Oral Injection Germany Italy Spain United KingdomRate per 100,000 standard units sold Codeine Morphine Oxycodone TramadolFig. 88 N on-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids in g ermany, it aly, Spain, and the United Kingdom, 2018 Source: Based on the table in Iwanicki et al., \"Tramadol Non-Medical Use in Four European Countries\" .

Some of the supply factors accelerating the spread of fentanyls in North America include: diffusion of simpler, more effective methods of manufacture of synthetic opioids and their analogues (primarily fentanyls), facilitated by the avail - ability on the Internet of instructions for their manufacture; an associated shift from preparation by a limited number of skilled chemists to preparation by \"simple cooks\"; an expanding number of fentanyl ana - logues and research opioids discovered; a lack of effective control over precursors and of oversight of the industry; expanding distribution networks that reduce the risk of detection through the use of postal services and the Internet; and increased licit trade, including e-commerce.181, 182 Considering these factors, fentanyls remain a potential threat in opioid markets. The spread of fentanyls could occur rapidly if market dynamics result in a shortage of the main opioid used in any of the markets. Europe183 has a particularly diverse opioid problem, with various primary opioids reported through differ - ent indicators. These include heroin, methadone (illicit or street methadone), buprenorphine and fentanyls. Since 2012, 34 new fentanyls have been identified on the drug market in Europe,184 and seizures of fentanyls in Europe are becoming more widespread. The quan-tity of fentanyls seized in Europe amounted to a total of 15 kilograms in 2019, reported by 11 countries, three times the quantity seized in 2018. In 2020, however, 20 countries in Europe reported seizures of fentanyls 050100150200250 Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Number Tramadol fentanyls, by sex, England and Wales, 2011-2020 Source: United Kingdom, Office for National Statistics, \"Deaths related to drug poisoning by selected substances in England and Wales\" .

Fentanyl and its analogues are sold on the European market via online sources and at street level, some - times misrepresented as or adulterated with heroin or other drugs, such as falsified benzodiazepines.186 The main fentanyl analogues identified in Europe and impli - cated in a relatively large number of overdose deaths were cyclopropylfentanyl, carfentanil and acryloylfen - tanyl (78, 61 and 47 deaths, respectively, in 2018).187 European markets also see, with concern, a diverse array of means of administration of fentanyls, includ- ing nasal sprays and e-liquids for vaping in electronic cigarettes. 188 Fentanyls do not appear to be established in the opioid market in Europe, except for some pockets of use. For example, the syringes monitoring programme,r which collects information on substances injected in selected sites in Western Europe, showed that, in Vilnius, one third of collected and analysed syringes contained res - idues of carfentanil.189 In Paris, Oslo and Cologne, Germany, 1 per cent or less of the collected syringes contained fentanyl residues. Between 2017 and 2018, Sweden, Estonia and Germany reported marked decreases in the number of deaths related to fentanyl and its analogues, whereas Finland reported an increase from 4 to 11 cases.190 In Germany, the number of fentanyl overdose deaths has remained stable, at approximately 35 deaths each year since 2018. Sweden, which in the past reported high rates of over - dose deaths attributed to the use of opioids, including heroin and fentanyls, has seen rates fall considerably since 2016, and in 2020, the country recorded no deaths related to fentanyl analogues. Following a decline in heroin availability in Estonia, 3-methylfentanyl appeared on the drug market in 2002. By 2005, 3-methylfentanyl and mixtures of 3-methylfentanyl and fentanyl accounted for the majority of opioids seized and for an increasing number r The pr ogramme collects information on substances injected by analysing the residual content of discarded syringes collected from different programmes in selected sites across Western Europe. It does not include Eastern Europe.of overdose deaths.191 In 2018, fentanyl and carfentanil were the two main synthetic opioids used by regular opioid users.192 However, since then, overdose deaths have declined considerably, and in 2020, 31 drug over - dose deaths were recorded, down from a peak of 170 01020304050607080 050100150200250300350400450 2017 2018 \"Rauschgiftkriminalit\u00e4t: Bundeslagebild 2020\" , and previous years (in German). 93 Opioid o verdose deaths in Sweden, 2016-2020 Source: Sweden, National Board of Forensic Medicine, 2020.

In wastewater samples collected from 30 cities across seven regions of China between 2016 and 2019, fentanyl was detected in only a small number of samples, with only 5 per cent or less of samples in different rounds detecting low levels of fentanyl metabolites.195 In Australia, the non-medical use of fentanyls is not uncommon. In 2018, there were 189 overdose deathss involving fentanyl, pethidine or tramadol,t comprising 21 per cent of all overdose deaths involving opioids and representing a more than thirteenfold increase, from 14 deaths in 2001 to 189 in 2018.196 According to wastewater analyses conducted across Australia, aver - age per capita consumption of fentanyl at state capital s Thes e are labelled as unintentional drug induced deaths. t Ov erdose deaths for these substances are reported together.sites was approximately half of that observed at sites outside the capitals between August 2018 and June 2021 (approximately 4 doses per 1,000 people per day and around 8 doses per 1,000 people per day, respec- tively). Prior to December 2018, there had been a steady (though not uniform) increase in consumption of fentanyl in the capital cities and outside them. How - ever, since then, the consumption of fentanyl at all sites has declined considerably, falling to around 2 doses per 1,000 people per day at all sites.197 However, it should be noted that wastewater analysis cannot differentiate between the use of opioids, including fentanyl, for therapeutic purposes and their non-med - ical use. 020406080100120140160180 2000 200220042006200820102012201420162018 2020Number Men Women 94 Drug o verdose deaths in Estonia, 2000-2020 Source: Estonian Forensic Science Institute, for the data for the period 2000-2009; and Estonian Causes of Death Registry, for the data for the period 2010-2020.
