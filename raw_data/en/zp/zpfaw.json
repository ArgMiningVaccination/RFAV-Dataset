It was created in the 1800s to treat malaria fever. Later, its uses diversified to soothe and alleviate common problems in babies such as colic, an upset stomach, teething pain, hiccups, and other tummy troubles. The initial formulation contained alcohol. Currently, alcohol-based gripe water is discontinued due to the adverse effects of alcohol on babies [(3)](https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/babies-can-get-sick-alcohol). These days, most gripe water brands use sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and a few herbs such as dill seed oil, peppermint, fennel, chamomile, or ginger [(4)](https://www.sutterhealth.org/health/south-asian/childrens/myths). They may also contain other artificial flavors [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356971/). It may be noted that gripe water is not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since it is marketed as an herbal supplement and not a medicine [(6)](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw31230).
