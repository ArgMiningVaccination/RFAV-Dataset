It releases negative energy to clear the mind. This remedy can be used to increase confidence, mental clarity and creative self-expression. Amber is not a crystal, but fossilized resin. This comes in a brown 1 oz. glass bottle with a dropper. It is made using spring water and a preservative. We offer a choice of 3 different preservatives, 100p Vodka, 80p Brandy or Apple Cider Vinegar. Dosage is 4 drops four times a day. Take straight onto tongue or mix in a glass of water and sip. As essences are also absorbed through the skin you can add some drops to a soothing bath or rub a few drops on the inside of your wrist. Flower Essences are made with the energy of the flower. We use the no-touch method so there is no plant material in the essence. Essences have no scent of the flower. *This statement has not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration.
