DuPr\u00e9's mother also promoted natural, healthy eating, along with staying physically and mentally active, to prevent illness. Those physical, mental and spiritual threads intertwined and instilled in DuPr\u00e9 a belief that an energetically balanced body can restore itself to stay healthy and happy. DuPr\u00e9 had worked for many years in the fashion industry as a makeup artist. She was also an executive with Lanc\u00f4me Cosmetics. She noticed how confident people felt when they knew they looked good, so DuPr\u00e9 pondered other ways she could further enhance peoples' lives. During the early 1990s, DuPr\u00e9 felt guided to a healing arts school, where she had discovered reiki. \"I felt like I was called home,\" she enthuses. \"I began studying energy work, I found at that time on the East Coast, it was difficult to find skilled energy healers. I started working with indigenous people, and that's when I met my first shaman.\" For nearly three decades, DuPr\u00e9 has practiced healing arts such as reiki; Jin Shin Jyutsu, an art of releasing tension by clearing energetic pathways; pranic healing; and polarity balancing, which works with life energy in all its forms. She provides energy healing services for adults, children and pets, and specializes in releasing dark, dense energy. As a continuous student, she regularly works with teachers such as the renowned mystic and author Thomas H\u00fcbl, from Germany. \"When I work with clients, it's about one thing\u2014improving the quality of their lives,\" DuPr\u00e9 emphasizes. \"I am there to guide them so they can discover what really resonates and speaks to them, and how to open and return to their core selves.\" DuPr\u00e9 explains that all life contains magnetic fields of energy. That energy can become blocked and congested from trauma and environmental toxins such as a poor diet. Energy healing helps release blockages to allow the body's energy to flow more freely, thus restoring physical, spiritual and mental wellness. DuPr\u00e9 performs energy healing on people with depression, physical disorders, cancer, and people who are experiencing energy work for the first time. She begins by explaining basic thoughts about she will do. Through gentle touch, the therapies begin to release blockages and balance energy within the body. DuPr\u00e9 invites conversation if one needs clarity or deeper understanding for processing issues, or she'll people just rest and restore as she performs the service. By opening the body's energy channels, the body can heal. DuPr\u00e9 notes that reiki is becoming more mainstream and is used in hospitals and clinics. She occasionally hears misconceptions about energy healing; some people believe that an energy healer can magically remove challenging issues or physical disorders. \"Healing the soul requires finding your own process. A true healer can guide you and help you find things within yourself. I can help open the energy within but keeping those channels open requires effort.\" She notes that people can keep the body's energy flowing by paying attention to what they're ingesting, not just when it comes to food but, also by limiting contact with people with toxic \"doom and gloom\" attitudes, as well as avoiding negative reading materials and media. \"It's not an easy process, but we have to build our toolboxes. Life will not be beautiful all the time, but when uncomfortable things do enter our lives, we can use these tools to keep our body's energy from suppressing us or shutting us down.\" DuPr\u00e9 begins each day at 4 a.m. with mediation, deep contemplative work, journaling and physical exercise. As society gradually returns to pre-pandemic life, she will teach more classes on guided mediation, energy clearing, reiki and transparent communication, a practice that encourages people to be fully present and thoroughly listen during conversations with other people. DuPr\u00e9 observes that as more people search for depth and meaning in their lives, they become more awakened. \"If they're not fully, wholly and completely in love with their lives, they can find ways to change it. There's so much available, so why not find joy? That is the most crucial energy we need on Earth.\" Diane DuPr\u00e9 is located at Twin Ponds Integrative Health Center, 628 Twin Ponds Rd., Breinigsville.
