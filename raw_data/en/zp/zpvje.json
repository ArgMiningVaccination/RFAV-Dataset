Manual healing methods date back to ancient times, but the chiropractic profession didn't come about until the [late 19th century](https://www.acatoday.org/about/history-of-chiropractic/). Today, chiropractors follow physicians and dentists to make up the [third largest](https://www.nbce.org/about-nbce/chiropractic-care) group of primary healthcare professionals in the United States. Chiropractic care is [regulated](https://www.nbce.org/about-nbce/chiropractic-care/) in all 50 states, and chiropractors practice in [90 countries](https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-019-0255-x) Yet, as you may have read or heard for yourself, some people consider chiropractic a form of pseudoscience. Healthcare professionals don't always agree about the role of chiropractic when it comes to certain conditions, along with claims that lack scientific proof. That said, with a wealth of evidence supporting chiropractic care for certain types of pain, especially back pain, more and more medical doctors recommend it alongside other treatments. Read on for an in-depth exploration of the scientific support for chiropractic care, plus information about its potential uses and benefits. People turn to chiropractors to treat all kinds of injuries and conditions, including: Experts continue to study the potential benefits and risks of chiropractic care for these and other conditions and injuries. While science may not currently back every existing claim of the benefits of chiropractic treatment, [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307916/) A few research-backed benefits of chiropractic care: - It may [reduce the need for opioid treatment](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/21/12/3567/5788462?login=false). - It can make chronic back pain treatment .

That said, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone responds the same way to chiropractic treatment. What works for one person may not necessarily work for you. A number of myths and misconceptions about the practice contribute to the idea that chiropractic is pseudoscience. Let's shed some light on the most common ones: Myth: You don't need a degree to be a chiropractor Chiropractors don't hold an M.D., and they aren't medical doctors. But they do graduate with a doctor of chiropractic degree and are licensed practitioners. Becoming a [chiropractor](/health/are-chiropractors-doctors) typically requires: - a 4-year undergraduate degree - 3 to 5 years at an accredited chiropractic college - a clinical internship Myth: The only thing chiropractors do is crack your back Chiropractors treat issues affecting the musculoskeletal system and nervous system. Along with adjustments to realign joints, they also offer: - soft tissue therapy - exercise and nutrition counseling - postural testing and analysis [ultrasound](/health/therapeutic-ultrasound) [electronic stimulation](/health/pain-relief/e-stim#what-it-is) - low-level laser therapy, also called [cold laser therapy](/health/cold-laser-therapy) Myth: Medical doctors don't believe in chiropractic treatment Not all experts agree on the role of chiropractic care in the treatment of certain conditions due to the need for more research. Even so, chiropractic care is largely accepted as a complementary treatment for issues like neck and back pain. This is partly thanks to mainstream medical journals publishing studies exploring the benefits of chiropractic care. The American College of Physicians [guidelines](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/P17-9032) also include spinal manipulation as one of the suggested first-line treatments for low back pain. Myth: Chiropractic adjustments are dangerous You may experience a few side effects after an adjustment, including: - temporary muscle soreness - stiffness - increased pain Some serious complications have been associated with spinal manipulations, but these remain relatively rare. Possible serious complications include: - cervical artery dissections, which can lead to [stroke](/health/neck-cracking-stroke) [cauda equina syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/cauda-equina-syndrome) [herniated disc](https://www.healthline.com/health/herniated-disk) - fractures The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) considers spinal manipulation [relatively safe](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/spinal-manipulation-what-you-need-to-know) Important If you have a condition that causes joint inflammation or are receiving treatment for any other medical condition, it's best to check with your care team before getting an adjustment. Wondering exactly what experts have to say about the benefits and limits of chiropractic care? Here's a breakdown of the current evidence. Low back pain Research suggests chiropractic care can help improve low back pain for some people. A 2017 [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28399251/) A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6324527/) - reported less pain intensity and an improvement in function - experienced less disability - reported higher satisfaction with their treatment - needed less pain medication Neck pain A [2021 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8584283/) According to a [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025692/) [oxytocin](/health/how-to-increase-oxytocin), neurotensin, and other natural pain-relieving hormones in your body. Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis pain happens when the degeneration of cartilage in the joints causes bone to rub against bone. Some chiropractic adjustments may help OA pain by reducing bone-on-bone contact, but research studying the benefits of chiropractic for OA remain limited. A small [2021 study](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-back-and-musculoskeletal-rehabilitation/bmr210192) of people with spine or extremity OA did find evidence to suggest that chiropractic care appeared to help significantly reduce pain scores. Headaches People commonly consult chiropractors for help with headaches, including migraine. While some evidence suggests that spinal manipulation can help some types of headache, more high-quality research is needed. One [2017 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.13166) The researchers noted this was likely a placebo response. Still, spinal manipulation could be an option if other therapeutic treatments don't help. A [2020 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32621321/) [cervicogenic headache](/health/headache/cervicogenic-headache). But it didn't have a significant long-term impact. A [2021 study](https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-020-00360-3) Boosting the immune system Something experts agree chiropractic can't do? Boost your immune system. In March 2020, the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) posted a report claiming that chiropractic adjustments can boost the immune system, implying that chiropractic care might help prevent [COVID-19](/health/coronavirus-covid-19). (The report has since been removed.) According to a critical [review](https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-020-00312-x) You have a few options for finding a reputable chiropractor in your area: - Ask your doctor or other healthcare professional for recommendations. - Ask your friends or family members if they have any recommendations. - Use the American Chiropractic Association's [Find a Doctor tool](https://handsdownbetter.org/find-a-doctor/). - Consult a search engine for highly rated chiropractors near you. Before choosing a practitioner, you may also find it helpful to: - Make sure your chiropractor is licensed by your [state chiropractic board](https://www.fclb.org/Boards.aspx). - Schedule a consultation with a chiropractor to see if they're a good fit. - Ask about cost and accepted insurance plans. It never hurts to read customer reviews about both a specific chiropractor and the office where they practice. What do people have to say about their professionalism and treatment? Do they generally feel satisfied? If you feel uncomfortable after an adjustment, with either the treatment or your chiropractor's approach, don't hesitate to try another practitioner. Keep in mind, too, that chiropractic treatment may simply not be right for you. Chiropractic care offers one possible approach to treating certain types of pain, but it's not an approach everyone finds comfortable. Chiropractic isn't pseudoscience. While research continues into its potential uses, evidence does support its benefits as part of a treatment plan for pain. If you'd like to give chiropractic treatment a try, start by asking your care team whether this treatment might be a good option for you. You can also ask a doctor or physician for a referral.
