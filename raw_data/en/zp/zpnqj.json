Ashley HotoPosted 9 months ago on BookRetreats Needed a long break from life and winter Cocoa ceremony's were very healing. My body loved doing yoga/meditation everyday and the food was delicious & nourishing. MettePosted 9 months ago on BookRetreats I just want to send you a few words after my lovely days at Eden. It was an absolutely healing and beautiful time. I got so many learnings and insights on and for my life and living. I'm ready to let it all grow beautifully inside my. To give yourself those breaks and time to find an inner peace is so important for all of us and I'm so grateful that I it. So thank you all for guidance with love, fun and sweetness. Thank you for bringing new lovely poses, energy work and mindfulness to the classes every day. Say hi to the sweetest ladies in the kitchen and say thanks for all the beautiful food, smiles and holas. So what a treat, what a beautiful journey it was. Thank you. Hope to see you all again in the future. Let the loving spirit grow in you. With love Mette HavitalPosted 2 months ago on BookRetreats Andrea the yoga teacher is just awful, there are no words to describe her, she is so inappropriate it is shocking. The owner was informed about her behavior, not sure if he cares. I would suggest you go elsewhere - the area is beautiful, however, the description of the offering at the retreat is not as I thought - tools for life???? for real? If you want a clean towel the manager has to reach out to the owner in Holland, someone had a snake in their room and one day the water was off in the middle of my shower... LizPosted 2 months ago on BookRetreatsJust what I needed. I was exhausted and needed a re-set. Eden was just what I'd hoped for.
