BACKGROUND The primary care clinician is integral in the delivery of preventive and acute health carefor many childhood cancer survivors, particularly those who are in their young adult years. This high-risk population is relatively small but growing. In 1997, there werean estimated 270,000 childhood cancer survivors in the United States; 46% were 20 to 40 years old and 18% were older than 40 years. 1About 1 in every 640 young adults between the ages of 20 and 39 years is a childhood cancer survivor. Many of these survivors face a significantly increased risk of late-occurring serious morbidity or premature mortality. Among those treated from the 1970s to the 1990s, about 75% will develop a chronic disease by 40 years of age, and more than 40% willdevelop a serious health problem ( Figs. 1 and 2). 2-4 The excess risk of premature death from a second cancer, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease is elevated beyond 30 years after the original cancer diagnosis(Fig. 3 ). 5Almost half of long-term survivors will have moderate to extremely diminished health status, including limitations in activity and functional impairment.6,7Although some serious problems occur during the cancer therapy or soon thereafter (long-term effects), the majority do not become clinically apparent until many years afterthe cancer was diagnosed (late effects). Fortunately, the incidence and severity of many late effects of therapy can be reduced through prevention or early detection. For this reason, the Institute ofMedicine recommends periodic monitoring of all childhood cancer survivors throughout their life span, including a systematic plan for screening, surveillance, and prevention that incorporates risks based on the previous cancer, cancer therapy,genetic predispositions, lifestyle behaviors, and comorbid health conditions. 1Over the past 15 to 20 years, many centers that treat children with cancer have developedspecialized Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) programs to deliver risk-based care.Through these programs, survivors and their families are educated about their long-term health risks, counseled about avoiding risky health behaviors, and monitored for late effects of cancer therapy. As part of this care, the LTFU staff prepares a cancer treatment summary for the patient, family, and the patient's physicians (Fig. 4 ). To assist in the follow-up care of childhood cancer survivors, the Children's Oncology Group (COG), the National Cancer Institute-supported pediatric oncologyclinical trials organization for North America, has developed risk-based guidelinesfor specific therapeutic exposures. 8First released in 2003, the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, andYoung Adult Cancers contain recommendations for screening for late complications that may occur as a result of therapeutic exposures used to treat pediatric malignan-cies. A hybrid of evidence-based and consensus-driven approaches was used to develop the guidelines. For each therapeutic exposure, the strength of evidence from the literature linking that exposure with an adverse outcome was considered,and a multidisciplinary panel of experts in the late effects of pediatric cancer made a consensus-based recommendation for periodic screening. The COG Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines are periodically updated. Fig. 5 is a snapshot from the current version 3. The COG has also developed an extensive collection of educationalmaterials for patients, called Health Links , that complement a variety of survivorship topics addressed in the Guidelines . 9The COG Long-Term Follow-Up GuidelinesOeffinger et al ori ginal cancer dia gnosisGrade 1-5 Grade 3-5 Fig. 1.

Work is currently in progress to develop a web-based version of the COG Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines that will generate individually tailored guidelines for survivors based on their specific therapeutic exposures.10 Unfortunately, despite this evolving infrastructure risk-based care is not the norm for most childhood cancer survivors, particularly those in their adult years who are at substantially increased risk of serious disease.11,12Whereas many cancer centers have established LTFU programs, some lack the resources and personnel to do so.Indeed, many of the existing LTFU programs have limited resources and few provideservices for patients who are 25 years or older. Thus, the vast majority of adult survivors are not followed at a cancer center at a time when many experience increasing risk for second cancers, cardiac disease, and other serious healthoutcomes ( Fig. 6 ). 13Compounding this, most survivors who were treated in the 1970s and 1980s have never been seen in an LTFU program, do not have a cancertreatment summary, do not remember important details of their cancer therapy, andare generally unaware of their long-term risks. ROLE OF THE PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN Most long-term childhood cancer survivors will present to a primary care clinician fortheir routine health care needs or when they develop new signs and symptoms. Thus, it is imperative that the primary care clinician be familiar with this high-risk population. This task can be challenging. Childhood cancer survivors represent a very small Fig. 3.

In a routine year in a typical primary care practice, a clinician is likely to see less than 5 childhood cancer survivors, each with a different cancer treated with a different regimen. Recognizing the competingdemands of a busy practice and the relative infrequency of seeing a childhood cancer survivor, it can be difficult to stay up to date with the health risks associated with specific cancer therapies, much less with the recommendations for surveillance.However, the primary care clinician can play a pivotal role in the health and well-being of a childhood cancer survivor by delivering risk-based health care. This article is intended to assist the primary care clinician in this role. Fig. 4. Template for Cancer Treatment Summary.

J Clin Oncol 2009;27(14):2363-73; with permission.)Oeffinger et al 748The long-term complications of childhood cancer treatment for which an individual survivor is at risk are determined by several factors, including cancer diagnosis, age at the time of treatment, chemotherapy and radiation received (including cumulative doses), genetic predisposition, and current health-related behaviors, such as tobacco and alcohol use, diet, and physical activity. To provide comprehensive care for thechildhood cancer survivor, the primary care clinician must first determine what treat- ment each survivor received and for which complications the survivor is potentially at risk. Communication between the survivor's treatment center and the primary care clini- cian should include a clear delineation of the role of the specialty center and theprimary care practice in the continued care of the patient. This role delineation mayvary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual survivor, includinggeographic and insurance considerations, as well as the magnitude of risk for late complications that each survivor faces. Regardless of the roles taken by the cancer center and the primary care clinician in caring for the childhood cancer survivor,ongoing communication between them is a crucial element in providing optimal survi- vorship care. For survivors who return to the cancer center for regular comprehensive late effects evaluations, results of these evaluations should be communicated to the primary careclinician in a timely fashion. Any new health problems identified by the primary care clini- cian should similarly be communicated to the cancer center. For those patients primarilymanaged in the primary care setting, a communication channel should be maintained with the cancer center in order for the cancer center to convey new findings relevant to the survivors' care, such as new screening recommendations or newly emerginglate effects for which additional monitoring is indicated. In addition, the primary careprovider should communicate newly identified late complications back to the cancer center (with the survivors' permission) to assist in timely identification of posttreatment trends and treatment-related effects. To enable primary care clinicians to locate theappropriate ''late effects'' clinicians at a cancer center, the COG maintains an updated link to search by locale or center: http://www.childrensoncologygroup.org/Surveys/ lateEffects/lateEffects.PublicSearch.asp . DEVELOPING RISK GROUPS TO GUIDE SURVIVORSHIP CARE Treatment of most pediatric cancers today is ''risk-directed,'' aiming to provide the best chance for long-term survival while balancing potential short- and long-termtoxicities. As a result, those with high-risk disease generally receive more intensetherapy, and have greater potential for long-term complications, than those with lower-risk disease. Treatment received by pediatric cancer survivors therefore varies widely in terms of intensity, therapeutic modalities employed, and the potential forlong-term complications. Low-risk Group Survivors at lowest risk for long-term complications generally include those whose treatment involved surgery alone (eg, certain patients with limited stage neuroblas- toma, thyroid carcinoma, or germ cell tumors) or limited chemotherapy associatedwith minimal long-term risk (eg, patients with low-stage Wilms tumor treated with nephrectomy, vincristine, and actinomycin-D). Risk for long-term complications in this group is low, and once appropriate information regarding potential health risksand indicated screening is obtained from the cancer center, follow-up care can often be provided in a primary care setting without the need for specialized oncologic follow-up, thus avoiding overmedicalization for survivors at lowest risk.Survivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 749Intermediate-risk Group Survivors at moderate risk for long-term complications related to cancer treatment include the majority of patients, such as those who received standard treatmentsfor leukemia, lymphoma, and many solid tumors. Patients in this group have not undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and have not received high doses of radiation therapy. Follow-up care for these patients can generally be sharedbetween the cancer center and the primary care clinician. High-risk Group Survivors at highest risk for late effects, such as those treated for central nervoussystem tumors, patients who received radiation therapy for treatment of Hodgkinlymphoma, and those who underwent HCT, should ideally receive their follow-up care in a cancer center by a multidisciplinary team specializing in the long-term complications of childhood cancer therapy. Annual evaluations for treatment-relatedcomplications may be handled at the cancer center. However, primary care for themajority of these patients, including management of intercurrent illnesses and ongoing management of comorbidities, is often provided in the community by primary care clinicians. Even for survivors at highest risk, shared care between the cancer centerand the primary care clinician remains important. LATE EFFECTS OF CANCER THERAPY The understanding of late effects has grown substantially over the last 3 decades. Inthe following sections a synopsis of key late effects, by major treatment exposures, is presented, although an exhaustive and detailed review of late effects is beyond the scope and purpose of this article. A brief historical perspective of the changes intherapy over time is also provided, and therapies used for different major cancer groups highlighted. Key screening recommendations from the COG Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines are provided in Table 1 . These recommendations and the review are focused on the long-term survivors and do not include recommendationsfor screening for recurrence of the primary disease. In addition, this article frequently refers to the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). 14In brief, the CCSS is a retro- spectively ascertained and prospectively followed cohort of over 14,000 long-termsurvivors of childhood cancer who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, and about 3600 of their siblings (without cancer). This endeavor, supported by the National Cancer Institute, has contributed greatly to the understanding of long-term outcomesof childhood cancer survivors. RADIOTHERAPY Radiotherapy (RT) is critically important in the cure of many childhood cancers.However, the developing and growing tissues of children and adolescents are partic- ularly sensitive to the effects of radiation. Late effects of RT may be evident soon after therapy (eg, cognitive dysfunction) or many years later (eg, coronary artery disease,second malignant neoplasms). The incidence and severity of radiation-related late effects are influenced by the organs and tissues included in the treatment field, type of radiation administered, daily fractional and cumulative radiation dose, and age attreatment. It is anticipated that improvements in the delivery of radiation therapy over the past 20 years, combined with multimodal risk-adapted therapeutic approaches, will result in fewer late effects attributable to this treatment modality.Oeffinger et al 750The following 3 sections describe the primary late effects associated with RT deliv- ered to the brain, chest, and abdomen/pelvis. Description of some outcomes related to total body irradiation (TBI), commonly used in preparation for an HCT, is integrated into the appropriate sections. For reference, the Gray (Gy) is the international unit of absorbed radiation dose, with 1 Gy equivalent to 1 J/kg. An older term that is some-times seen in the medical record is a ''rad''. One rad is equal to 1 cGy (1 Gy 5100 cGy 5100 rads). Regardless of the irradiated region, the skin and musculoskeletal system are often affected. Childhood cancer survivors who were treated with RT have an increased risk for melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma in the radiation field, 15in addition to musculoskeletal changes.16In the early days of RT, this some- times resulted in dramatic asymmetric growth of the spine or other structures.However, even with contemporary RT, survivors may have pain or problems with function. Cranial Radiotherapy Radiation to the brain is used to treat brain tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL), and head and neck soft tissue sarcoma. As the late effects of cranial RT have become known, more recent treatment protocols have either eliminated use (low-and standard-risk ALL) or are attempting to lower doses (brain tumors). Conventional therapy for posterior fossa tumors, such as medulloblastomas and ependymomas, includes 36 Gy craniospinal RT with a 15 to 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa. Currenttrials are assessing the use of lower-dose craniospinal with a 30.6 Gyboost to the posterior fossa. High-dose local field radiation (tumor plus margin) is used in the treatment of glial tumors and craniopharyngiomas. From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, 24 Gy cranial RT was standard therapy for all children with ALL. Withcontemporary therapy, only about 5% to 25% of ALL patients, primarily those with high-risk disease, are treated with cranial RT (12-18 Gy). Ten percent of rhabdomyo- sarcoma occurs in the head and neck region. Radiation to the tumor site, generally inhigher doses of 40 to 50 Gy, is administered along with chemotherapy. Children with nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas receive similar doses of radiation. Cognitive dysfunction following cranial radiotherapy Cognitive dysfunction following radiation to the brain is volume- and dose-related, and is generally apparent soon after therapy. Thus, children treated with higher doses ofradiation to the whole brain (cranial RT), such as those with a medulloblastoma, are most impacted. Deficits include diminished full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal IQ, nonverbal memory, and visual-spatial abilities, and problems with atten-tion-concentration and somatosensory functioning. 17As a result of these cognitive deficits, brain tumor survivors treated with higher doses of cranial RT are less likelyto complete high school, be employed, and live independently. Those treated ata younger age are particularly susceptible. 18In a review of 22 studies of children with brain tumors, survivors treated at a younger age had a 14-point greater deficit in IQ compared with those treated later in childhood.19About 70% of brain tumor survivors diagnosed before the age of 6 years and treated between 1970 and 1986 required special education services in school.20Recent studies encouragingly suggest that treatment of medulloblastoma with lower-dose craniospinal RT (23.4Gy) and a higher boost to the posterior fossa is associated with less neurocognitivetoxicity. 21,22 Though not as devastating as higher-dose cranial RT for brain tumors, treatment with 24 Gy cranial RT for ALL is also associated with cognitive dysfunction.

Although more than half of patients had mild tomoderate learning problems, outcomes were highly variable, and some patients expe-rienced 20- to 30-point losses, whereas others had no discernible changes. Additional deficits have been noted in visual-spatial abilities, attention-concentration, nonverbal memory, and somatosensory functioning. 23,24Females and those treated with cranial RT before 4 years of age are likely to have more severe dysfunction.23,24Treatment with 18 Gy cranial RT is associated with less neuropsychological toxicity than 24 Gy.25 When neurocognitive problems occur, children commonly present with school difficulties. Thus, primary care clinicians should be aware of this risk, recognize theschool difficulties associated with prior cancer therapy, and have an approach to screening, intervention, and advocacy. Neuroendocrine dysfunction following cranial radiotherapy Neuroendocrine dysfunction is a common dose- and site-related late effect following radiation to the brain. Among 1607 brain tumor survivors in the CCSS, 43% reported atleast one endocrine condition. 26Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is the most common endocrinopathy; and occurs more frequently with doses in excess of 18 to 20 Gy to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Risk factors for GHD include higher doses of radiation, younger age at exposure, and female gender.27,28Treatment with growth hormone in these patients usually results in near normalization of final height, unless the spinal axis has also been irradiated. Growth hormone deficiency in adults is associated with an increase in prevalence of dyslipidemia, insulin resis-tance, and cardiovascular mortality. 29In a recent study of embryonal brain tumor survivors treated with a median dose of 44 Gy to the HPA, the cumulative incidenceat 4 27TSH and ACTH deficiency may not develop until several years after radiation.27,30Gonadotropin, TSH, and ACTH deficiency is uncommon among survivors treated with less than 40 Gy to the HPA.27,30 Obesity following cranial radiotherapy Moderate-dose cranial RT (18-24 Gy) among ALL survivors is associated with obesity, particularly in females treated at a young age.31,32Female adult survivors of childhood ALL who were treated with 24 Gy cranial RT before 5 years old are 4 times more likely to be obese in comparison with women who have not been treated for a cancer.31In addition, women treated with 18 to 24 Gy cranial RT before the age of 10 years have a substantially greater rate of increase in their body mass index through their young adult years in comparison with women who were treated for ALL with only chemo- therapy or with women in the general population.32It appears that these women also have a significantly increased visceral adiposity and associated insulin resis- tance.33,34These outcomes are attenuated in males. Among brain tumor survivors treated with higher doses of cranial RT, only females treated at a younger age seem to be at increased risk for obesity.35 Other late effects associated with cranial radiotherapy Less common but serious outcomes associated with cranial RT include seizures andcerebrovascular accidents. 36,37There is a dose-related increased risk for meningi- omas and glial tumors.38Other late effects include cataracts, dental abnormalities and elevated risk of periodontal disease, and hearing loss.Oeffinger et al 756Chest and Mantle Radiotherapy Radiation to the chest or mantle is used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and metastases to the lungs (eg, soft tissue sarcoma, Wilmstumor). The group most often exposed to the highest average doses of radiation is that of patients with HL. Thus, most studies assessing risk of late effects following chest radiation have focused on this group. Mantle RT was the mainstay of treatment forstage I or II supradiaphragmatic HL from the 1960s through the 1980s. The mantle field encompasses the primary lymph node regions of the neck, supraclavicular, infracla- vicular, axillary, and mediastinal areas. This field also exposes the developing breasttissue and heart to significant doses of ionizing radiation. In general, radiation doses to the mantle ranged from 35 to 44 Gy. More recently, modified mantle RT with a lower total dose (15-25 Gy) with volumes reduced to only the involved nodes has been usedin combination with multiagent chemotherapy. The dose of radiation administered to the mediastinum or lungs for other primary malignancies or metastatic disease depends on the cancer type. Late effects are common following chest RT. It ispresumed that the incidence of late effects will decrease with more recent protocolsthat involve lower doses and smaller volumes. Breast cancer following chest radiotherapy Women treated with chest RT for a pediatric malignancy face a significantly increasedrisk of breast cancer at a young age (Fig. 7 ). The risk of breast cancer begins to increase 8 years after the onset of radiation; the median age of breast cancer diag-nosis ranges from 32 to 35 years. 39-41Risk of breast cancer is greatest among women who were treated for HL with high-dose mantle RT. By age 45 years, it is estimatedthat 12% to 20% of women treated with moderate- to high-dose chest RT will be diag-nosed with breast cancer. 39-41As in the general population, breast cancer outcomes among childhood cancer survivors are strongly associated with stage at diag-nosis. 42,43Of note, treatment options for these women are often limited due to previous chest RT and possible exposure to anthracycline chemotherapy. The COG recommends annual screening mammography and breast magnetic reso- nance imaging for women exposed to moderate- to high-dose chest RT (R 20 Gy), starting at age 25 years or 8 years after radiation, whichever occurs last. However, as evidenced in a recent CCSS study, most women in this high-risk population are not being screened as recommended.44Among women aged 25 to 39 years, only 37% reported a screening mammogram within the past 2 years; 47% had neverhad a mammogram. Whereas 77% of women 40 to 50 years old reported a screening mammogram within the past 2 years, only 53% were being regularly screened (at least 2 mammograms within 4 years). The strongest predictor of mammography in women25 to 39 years old was having a physician recommend the test, with the likelihood of reporting a mammogram 3 times higher among those who reported a physician recommendation than those who did not. Thus, it is important for clinicians to discussthis risk of breast cancer and the harms and benefits of screening with women who were treated with chest RT. Cardiovascular disease following chest radiotherapy Much of the heart is exposed in the mantle or mediastinal radiation field, increasing the risk for subsequent premature coronary artery, valvular, and pericardial disease. Inaddition, the carotid arteries are within the mantle field. Childhood cancer survivors in CCSS who were treated with chest RT had more than a threefold increase in relative risk for cardiac-related death in comparison with the standard United StatesSurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 757population.5Hull and colleagues45estimated that by 20 years after radiation, 16% have significant cardiovascular morbidity. Radiation-associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiac outcome following chest RT (Fig. 8 ). In a large British cohort study of HL survivors with an average of 11 years of follow-up, the standardized mortality risk from myocar- dial infarction was 3.2 for those who were treated with mediastinal RT.46By 20 years following RT, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic ischemic CAD is 21%47;b y3 0 years, the cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction is about 13%.48Traditional risk factors (smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes) further increase risk. More recent methods of shielding the heart and equally weighting the anterior and posterior fields seem to decrease the risk of cardiac late effects. However, even withcurrent shielding techniques, the proximal coronary arteries are within the mediastinal field. Early identification of asymptomatic CAD, aggressive management of modifiable risk factors, and medical interventions may reduce morbidity and mortality. Of note,HL survivors may be somewhat unusual in their presentation with CAD, as they may not present with typical substernal chest pressure or pain because of a change in the pain perception after radiation. 49,50Moreover, the vessels affected by mediastinal irradiation are proximal, including the left main artery and the left anterior descendingartery, and thus the potential magnitude and seriousness of the myocardial infarction is greater. 50Based on this evidence and because risk of coronary artery disease in these patients may be reduced with aggressive intervention and follow-up, screening for asymptomatic CAD in HL survivors has been recommended.48,50To date, there has been only one prospective study assessing screening in this population.

The role of breast magnetic imaging in screening for breast cancer. PPO Updates 2008;22(5); with permission.)Oeffinger et al 758Heidenreich and colleagues51used 2 indirect methods of screening (stress echocar- diography and radionucleotide perfusion scan) to detect CAD asymptomatic HL survivors. Twenty-one percent of the HL survivors had an abnormal test. Of these,50% (or 11% of total) had CAD proven by conventional coronary angiography. Chest RT is also associated with valvular disease, predominantly on the left side. 52 About 6% of HL survivors develop clinically significant valvular disease, with aorticstenosis being the most common outcome. 45Long-term problems related to pericar- dial disease or dysrhythmias are less common. In addition, mantle RT is associatedwith an increased risk of carotid artery disease and stroke. 53,54 Pulmonary disease following chest radiotherapy Acute radiation pneumonitis is an uncommon outcome with contemporary therapy.55 However, asymptomatic mild to moderate reductions in lung function, including diffu- sion capacity or abnormal restrictive or obstructive patterns, are common.56Concur- rent therapy with bleomycin increases risk of a persistent decrease in diffusion capacity.57,58For the majority of survivors who had chest RT, it is not known how the generally mild reductions in the diffusion capacity or mild restrictive or obstructivedisease will affect the patient with comorbid heart or lung problems associated withaging.

Chest RT was also associated with chronic cough, exercise-related dyspnea, and an abnormal chest wall. Lung cancer is also associatedwith chest RT, although it is infrequent in the young adult survivor unless he or she also smokes. 60,61 Thyroid disease following chest radiotherapy Thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism, is common following mantle or neck radiation. By 20 to 25 years after high-dose mantle radiation, the risk for hypothyroidism is about 40% to 50% and the risk for hyperthyroidism is about 3% to 5%.62,63Ionizing radiation penetrating the thyroid gland also frequently induces nodule development and occasionally, thyroid cancer (predominantly papillary or follicular carcinoma). The risk of thyroid cancer is not linearly related to the dose of radiation. Rather, risk increases through the low to moderate doses of radiation (10-25 Gy) and then decreases, dueto radiation-induced cell death, at higher doses (>35 Gy). 64 Abdominal and Pelvic Radiotherapy Abdominal and pelvic RT may lead to a variety of health problems involving the gastro- intestinal (GI) tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, and other genitourinary tract structures including the gonads. Radiation effects on the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen Long-term childhood cancer survivors treated with abdominal RT frequently complain of GI symptoms, including bloating, cramping, constipation, and loose stools. Often, these symptoms occur daily, and affect the patient's appetite and general quality oflife. Although these symptoms can be vague, it is important to remain vigilant fora change in the pattern, as they may be related to an underlying malignancy. Child- hood cancer survivors treated with abdominal or pelvic RT have an increased risk of colon cancer. 39,65,66In addition, patients treated with abdominal (or chest) RT also have an excess risk of gastric and esophageal cancer. Recognizing that symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease are common in the general population, pediatric cancer survivors should be appropriately evaluated for new or changing symptoms.Enteritis and malabsorption are uncommon following contemporary radiation therapy. Small bowel obstruction similarly is rare in the patient treated with only radiation (without abdominal surgery). Persistent or late-onset hepatopathy after contemporary radiation is uncommon, suggesting complete resolution of acute hepatic radiation injury. The liver generallyhas good tolerance to radiation doses up to 30 to 35 Gy using conventional dose frac-tionation. Hepatic radiation and a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, particularlythose used in conditioning regimens before HCT, have been associated with veno- occlusive disease (VOD). 67,68This complication seems to resolve in the majority of survivors, although long-term outcomes following VOD are unknown. Survivors who received splenic radiation at doses of 40 Gy or more (eg, for HL) are at increased risk for dysfunction and should be managed similarly to asplenic survivors (see later discussion ''Splenectomy'').69 Radiation effects on the genitourinary tract Abdominal RT, particularly to the entire abdomen (eg, TBI, whole abdominal RT) may result in late-onset renal insufficiency and hypertension, particularly in patients also treated with potentially nephrotoxic chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide orcisplatin. 70,71The hypertension is generally related to hyperreninemia and seems to respond to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,72although it may also be secondary to radiation-induced renal artery stenosis.70Oeffinger et al 760Pelvic RT may cause bladder fibrosis leading to a reduced bladder capacity, altered function, and microscopic or gross hematuria.73,74Clinical symptoms associated with this complication include dribbling, nocturnal enuresis, and frequency. Radiation effects on the gonads Because the ovaries and the testicular germinal epithelium are sensitive to radiation, infertility and premature gonadal dysfunction are common among childhood cancer survivors treated with pelvic RT. More than 70% of women in the CCSS who had been treated with 20 Gy or more of radiation to the ovary had acute ovarian failure.75 Doses less than 10 Gy were capable of inducing acute ovarian failure in women who received concomitant alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide) or were 13 to 20 years old at exposure. Survivors at greatest risk for acute ovarian failure are thosetreated with TBI in preparation for an HCT. Virtually all women treated with TBI after 10 years of age will develop acute ovarian failure, compared with only 50% of those treated before 10 years. 76,77 Female survivors treated with abdominal or pelvic RT who do not develop acute ovarian failure are at increased risk for premature menopause (eg, menopause before age 40 years) and having reduced ovarian reserve. For women treated with an alkylating agent plus abdominopelvic RT, the cumulative incidence of nonsurgical menopauseapproaches 30% by 40 years of age. 78The consequences of ovarian failure and prema- ture menopause extend beyond infertility and may include alterations in bone metabo-lism leading to osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction, and impaired body image. In recent years, much attention has been given to preserving fertility in females undergoing cancer therapy during childhood. When radiation fields include the pelvis,the ovaries can be surgically transposed to a more protected location. 79,80However, even after transposition of the ovaries, some women develop premature menopausesecondary to chemotherapy. Those who become pregnant after pelvic RT have an elevated risk of miscarriages, preterm deliveries, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. 81,82In the CCSS, low birth weight was reported for 25% of women who received uterine doses of 250 to 500 cGy and 36% of those who received doses greater than 500 cGy.82This higher dose of radiation to the uterus was also associated with an increased prevalence of SGA births (18%). Even low-dose radiation to the testicles is associated with decreased spermatogen- esis, with doses greater than 200 cGy invariably causing oligospermia or azoo- spermia.83Thus, males treated with TBI, with a fractionated dose of 12 to 15 Gy, are often rendered infertile.84Males with ALL who are treated with testicular RT for a testicular relapse will inevitably be azoospermic. Although modern techniques shieldthe testes, scatter from high-dose radiation to other fields (eg, pelvic, inguinal, orspinal radiation) can result in oligospermia or azoospermia. 85,86Radiation injury to Leydig cells is directly related to the dose delivered and inversely related to age at treatment.87,88Most prepubertal boys treated with 20 Gy or less fractionated testicular RT produce normal amounts of testosterone, although elevated plasma concentra- tions of luteinizing hormone (LH) observed in this group suggest subclinical injury. Prepubertal boys treated with 24 Gy for testicular leukemia uniformly have delayed onset of puberty and require androgen therapy.88Leydig cell failure occurs in 50% of adolescent and young adult men treated with radiation doses in excess of 33 Gy.89 CHEMOTHERAPY Evolution of Chemotherapy Chemotherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of childhood cancer. Most child- hood cancer survivors have received chemotherapy as part of their treatment, mainlySurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 761due to 2 considerations. (1) Radiation is used sparingly, if at all, in many childhood cancers due to the known potentially devastating late complications related to radia-tion in the growing child; therefore, chemotherapy is usually given in lieu of radiation whenever this is a viable option. (2) Due to the aggressive biologic nature of most childhood cancers, the disease is likely to be disseminated at the time of diagnosisand localized treatment is rarely a definitive option; therefore, chemotherapy is indi- cated in the majority of pediatric cancers. Chemotherapy was first employed in the treatment of childhood cancer in the 1940s with the introduction of antimetabolites. 90 In the 1950s, corticosteroids were introduced, followed by alkylating agents, anthra- cyclines, and vinca alkaloids in the 1960s, and epipodophyllotoxins and heavy metals in the 1970s. As children began to survive their cancers, long-term complicationsrelated to these agents emerged, and the relationships between these complicationsand cumulative dosage, age at therapy, and other salient risk factors were recognized. 91 Alkylating Agent Chemotherapy Gonadal dysfunction following alkylating agent cyclophosphamide, ifosfa- mide, or a nitrosourea) are risk for gonadal dysfunction. In the female, germ celldamage from alkylating agents has the potential to cause both infertility and loss of hormone production. The human ovary has a fixed set of primordial follicles at birth that is depleted as a result of normal menstrual cycles over each woman's lifetime,resulting in natural menopause at a median age of 51 years. 92Once the supply of follicles is depleted, which may occur prematurely due to injury and reduced supplyfollowing gonadotoxic cancer therapy, ovarian failure occurs. The onset of ovarianfailure can thus occur acutely\u2014during or shortly after cessation of therapy\u2014or it may take the form of premature onset of menopause. 92The ovary is much more sensi- tive to radiation-induced injury than to chemotherapy-related damage during child- hood, and young women who have received alkylating agent chemotherapy alone are less likely to experience acute ovarian failure than those with a history of pelvic or TBI. However, those treated with high doses of alkylating agents as a myeloablativepreparatory regimen before HCT are at high risk for acute ovarian failure. 93Premature menopause may occur in survivors who received intermediate and lower doses of alkylators. Factors associated with increased risk include higher cumulative doses of alkylating chemotherapy, older age at exposure, and treatment with radiation tothe abdomen or pelvis. 94For survivors with a history of alkylating agent chemo- therapy, careful attention should be given to menstrual and reproductive history.Survivors should be counseled regarding their risk for premature menopause andthe associated implications for family planning. Referral to a reproductive endocrinol- ogist may be indicated for those currently menstruating but not yet ready to begin a family, as they may wish to further evaluate their risk or explore fertility preservationoptions. For survivors experiencing premature menopause, hormonal replacementtherapy should be considered in light of the increased risk for reduction in bone mineral density and implications for cardiovascular health. Unlike the female, male gonadal damage is compartmentalized such that the germinal epithelium, the site of spermatogenesis, is much more sensitive to thegonadotoxic effects of cancer therapy than are the slower growing Leydig cells that support hormone production. Spermatogenesis is therefore often adversely affectedby alkylating agent chemotherapy, and the likelihood of infertility increases with higher cumulative doses. 85Although spontaneous return of spermatogenesis can occur for several years following exposure to lower cumulative doses of alkylating agents,95Oeffinger et al 762permanent sterility is generally seen in patients who received higher cumulative doses, and is inevitable for those who received testicular radiation.86Testosterone produc- tion is unlikely to be affected by exposure to alkylating agent chemotherapy alone, although subclinical Leydig cell dysfunction (as evidenced by elevated levels of LH) may occur. It is currently unknown whether subclinical dysfunction will lead to prema-ture androgen deficiency in these survivors as they age. 96Although elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone generally indicate impaired spermatogenesis, semenanalysis is a more definitive determination of fertility status. Because recovery ofspermatogenesis may sometimes occur in the first 10 years after therapy, testing should be repeated over time for those with oligospermia or azoospermia, and survi- vors should be counseled to use contraceptive measures unless pregnancy is desired.Leydig cell function should be evaluated via measurement of serum LH and testos-terone levels at age 14 in at-risk survivors, and in those with clinical symptoms of androgen deficiency. Alkylating agent therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia Patients who have received treatment with alkylating agents are at increased risk for development of secondary therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), often preceded by myelodysplasia.97These therapy-related leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by a relatively short latency period (peak risk 4-6 years after exposure)98and the presence of monosomy 5 or 7.97Risk is directly proportional to cumulative dose of alkylating agents, and reaches 8% at 10years following exposure. 99The period of risk generally does not exceed 15 years. Unfortunately, treatment of t-AML/MDS is difficult, and even with HCT, outcomes are generally inferior to those of patients with de novo AML.100 Pulmonary disease following alkylating late-onset lung fibrosis and chronicpulmonary dysfunction among childhood cancer survivors. 101Symptoms of pulmo- nary dysfunction may include chronic cough or dyspnea associated with exerciseintolerance. Smoking exacerbates the risk for pulmonary dysfunction, and all at-risksurvivors should be counseled regarding the importance of smoking cessation and avoidance. Genitourinary disease following alkylating agent chemotherapy Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide have been implicated in late complications involving the bladder, including hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder fibrosis.102,103 Cyclophosphamide has also been implicated in the rare development of bladdercancer. 104Damage to the bladder occurs as a result of acrolein, a metabolic by-product of these alkylating agents that is in the urine. Symptoms mayinclude hematuria, frequency, dysuria, nocturia, and dysfunctional voiding. In addition, ifosfamide is associated with renal glomerular and tubular dysfunction, 105potentially resulting in elevated levels of serum creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, or salt-wasting tubular dysfunction requiring chronic electrolyte supplementation. Nephrology consultation should be considered for those with hypertension, protein- uria, or agents that have played a significant role in advancing survival for many common pediatricSurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 763malignancies. These agents remain an essential component of contemporary therapy for 50% or more of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer.106 Anthracyclines have well-established cardiotoxicity that can manifest as asymptom- left ventricular dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and death.107-109With the use of contemporary pediatric regimens that limit cumulative anthracycline dose, early cardiotoxicity during or in the first year following treatment is rare.110However, late-onset anthracycline cardiotoxicity (eg, more than 1 year after completion of therapy) may occur, characterized by cardiac myocyte loss and failure of myocardial growth.107The resulting left ventricular wall thinning and elevated afterload can lead to a stiff, poorly compliant left ventricle and congestiveheart failure that may present as late as 15 to 25 years after anthracyclinetherapy. 111 Estimating risk for anthracycline injury in a given patient is confounded by the fact that investigations have differed in the methods used to evaluate and define cardiotox-icity. In a systematic review of well-designed studies that defined cardiotoxicity byepisodes of clinical heart failure, the frequency of cardiotoxicity ranged from 0% to 16%. 108Of concern is the increasing number of studies that have reported subclinical abnormalities of left ventricular systolic function in up to 57% of survivors evaluated by noninvasive testing methods.109These findings are problematic, because there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the long-term significance of these cardio-vascular abnormalities in a relatively young population without clinically symptomaticcardiovascular disease. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity has been reported at all dose levels; however, the risk increases at higher cumulative doses, younger age at first exposure, time fromexposure, and among female survivors. 108,109Among these risk factors, cumulative anthracycline dose is the most consistent and significant predictor of cardiotoxicity. Early studies established the cardiotoxic threshold dose of 550 mg/m2in adults112; however, numerous subsequent investigations demonstrated that children treated with lower cumulative anthracycline doses are at risk of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction and clinically significant cardiomyopathy.108,109,113,114Currently avail- able data from longitudinal studies indicate a definite risk of progressive cardiovas- cular dysfunction over time, particularly in survivors treated with cumulative anthracycline doses of 300 mg/m2or more.111,115As these cohorts age, the knowl- edge of long-term outcomes following contemporary risk-adapted regimens for favorable presentations of pediatric cancer (cumulative anthracycline doses lessthan 250 mg/m 2) will continue to evolve. Contrary to previous results advocating the relative safety of anthracycline therapy when doses are restricted to less than250 mg/m 2,114St. Jude investigators noted an excess risk of abnormalities of cardiac function after treatment with cumulative anthracycline doses in the range of 100 to 200 mg/m2.113Other studies evaluating the long-term impact of low- dose anthracycline exposure indicate that a significant proportion of survivors exhibit subclinical changes of cardiac dysfunction.116,117Whereas several investiga- tions have failed to demonstrate long-term cardiac injury in survivors treated withanthracycline doses limited to 100 mg/m 2or less,113,118cases of congestive heart failure have also been reported in survivors treated with low cumulative doses of an- thracyclines.108Thus, it is likely that demographic (age, sex, race) and treatment factors (combined use of anthracyclines and chest RT) modify the risk of anthracy- cline cardiotoxicity. In addition, conditions that impose a significant increase oncardiac workload (eg, pregnancy, labor, and delivery) may precipitate the acute onset of symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. 119Oeffinger al mercaptopurine, cytarabine) are antineoplastic agents predominantly used for treatment of pediatric hematologicalmalignancies, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Acute reversible toxicities are most commonly observed with these agents, but methotrexate-induced alteration of bone metabolism may impact long-term bone health by reducing bonemineral density and attainment of peak bone mass. Peak bone mass and osteoporosis following antimetabolite chemotherapy Maximal peak bone mass is an important factor influencing the risk of osteoporosisand fracture associated with aging. In healthy individuals, bone mass rises rapidlyduring puberty and typically peaks at the end of sexual development. 120Methotrexate reduces bone mineral accretion during therapy; this effect may be exacerbated by thechronic use of corticosteroids, another class of agents routinely used in the treatmentof hematological malignancies and in supportive care for a variety of pediatric cancers. Radiation-related endocrinopathies, such as GHD or hypogonadism, may contribute to ongoing bone mineral loss. 121,122In addition, suboptimal nutrition and physical inactivity may further predispose to deficits in bone mineral accretion. Most knowledge about cancer and its treatment effects on bone mineralization has been derived from studies of children with ALL. In this group, the leukemic processand possibly vitamin D deficiency may play a role in the alterations in bone metabolismand bone mass observed at diagnosis. 123Antileukemic therapy causes further bone mineral density (BMD) loss,124which has been reported to normalize over time125,126 or to persist for many years after completion of therapy.127,128Clinical factors predicting higher risk for low BMD include treatment with high cumulative doses of methotrexate (50 g/m2), high cumulative doses of corticosteroids (R9 g/m2), and use of more potent glucocorticoids like dexamethasone.129Investigations evaluating the contribution of cranial radiation to the risk of low BMD in childhood cancer survivors have yieldedconflicting results. 127,130 Corticosteroid Chemotherapy Osteonecrosis and corticosteroids Osteonecrosis (also known as aseptic or avascular necrosis) is a rare but well- recognized skeletal complication observed predominantly in survivors of pediatric hematological malignancies treated with corticosteroids.131,132The condition is characterized by death of one or more segments of bone that most often affect weight-bearing joints, especially the hips and knees. Longitudinal cohort studies have identified a spectrum of clinical manifestations of osteonecrosis, ranging fromasymptomatic spontaneously resolving imaging changes to painful progressive artic- ular collapse requiring joint replacement. 133,134Symptomatic osteonecrosis charac- terized by pain, joint swelling and reduced mobility typically presents during therapy. These symptoms may improve over time, persist, or progress in the years after completion of therapy. The reported prevalence of osteonecrosis affecting childhood cancer patients has varied from 1% to 15% based on the study population,treatment protocol, method of evaluation, and time from treatment. 131,135The most important clinical risk factor for osteonecrosis is treatment with substantial doses of glucocorticoids, as is typical in regimens used for ALL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and HCT.131,136Delayed intensification therapies for childhood ALL featuring the more potent glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, have been speculated to enhance risk, because osteonecrosis was infrequently reported before this approach becameSurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 765more widely used in the 1990s. However, currently available results suggest that cumulative corticosteroid dose may be a better predictor of this complication.131,136 Osteonecrosis is more common in adolescents than in children, with the highest risk among those who are older than 10 years.131,136Osteonecrosis also occurs much more frequently in whites than in blacks.131,137Studies evaluating the influence of gender on the risk of osteonecrosis have yielded conflicting results, with somesuggesting a higher incidence in females, 131,133which has not been confirmed by others.134,136Genetic factors influencing antifolate and glucocorticoid metabolism have also been linked to excess risk of osteonecrosis among survivors.137 Heavy Metals The platinum analogues, cisplatin and carboplatin, are atypical alkylators and, as such, are associated with risks for gonadal dysfunction, renal dysfunction, andt-AML/MDS (as discussed for the alkylating agents) among childhood cancersurvivors. In addition, the platinum analogues increase the risk of hearing loss, 138 peripheral sensory neuropathy,139and dyslipidemia.140Hearing loss associated with platinum chemotherapy is typically most severe in high-frequency ranges and prog-resses to the speech ranges with higher cumulative doses. More severely affected survivors (typically those who were younger during treatment and those who received high cumulative doses) will often need hearing aids or other assistive devices, specialaccommodations in the classroom, and the services of a speech or language profes- sional. Those who are less severely affected are still likely to have problems hearing soft speech and high-pitched sounds, and may also have difficulty hearing in noisyenvironments. Peripheral sensory neuropathy is generally not late in onset but may persist beyond therapy, requiring physical or occupational therapy, and in some cases treatment by a specialist adept in the management of neuropathic pain. Patients withdyslipidemia are at risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease andshould be counseled about management with diet and exercise; lipid-lowering agents may also be indicated in these patients. Epipodophyllotoxins Epipodophyllotoxin chemotherapy, such as etoposide and teniposide, are topoiso- merase-II inhibitors that place patients at risk for t-AML. The cumulative risk for t-AML in patients treated with epipodophyllotoxins has been reported at 3.8% by 6 years after exposure.141The latency period of epipodophyllotoxin-associated t-AML is shorter than that of secondary leukemia associated with alkylating agents, and the myelodysplastic phase is notably absent. Mutations in the MLL gene associated with 11q23 rearrangements are typically seen.98 SURGERY Evolution of Surgery in the Treatment of Childhood Cancer Surgery has historically been an important diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic modality in the management of pediatric malignancies, especially solid tumors. However, the role of surgery in contemporary treatment regimens has changed signif-icantly, concurrent with efforts to reduce long-term surgical morbidity. The develop- ment of effective combined-modality treatment protocols incorporating systemic chemotherapy and radiation not only reduced the risk of metastatic disease butalso precluded the need for more radical surgical interventions to achieve local tumor control. 142Advances in diagnostic imaging technology and recognition of long-term surgical morbidity resulted in the abandonment of aggressive surgical stagingOeffinger et al 766procedures.143,144Progress in radiation technology facilitated the development of less disfiguring approaches to eradicate microscopic residual disease while minimizing normal tissue injury. These changes collectively contributed to improved childhood cancer survival, and reduced surgical morbidity by promoting the development of organ and limb preservation surgeries. The subsequent sections briefly reviewtreatment complications associated with specific surgical procedures used in the management of pediatric and adolescent cancers. Amputation and Limb-sparing Surgery Amputation and limb-sparing surgery prevent local recurrence of bone tumors by removal of all gross and microscopic disease. If optimally executed, both procedures accomplish an en bloc excision of tumor with a margin of normal uninvolved tissue. The type of surgical procedure, the primary tumor site, and the age of the patient affectthe risk of postsurgical complications. Complications in survivors treated with amputation include stump-prosthetic problems, chronic stump pain, phantom limb pain, and bone overgrowth. 145Although limb-sparing surgeries may offer a more aesthetically pleasing outcome, complications have been reported more frequentlyin survivors undergoing these procedures compared with those treated with amputa- tion. Complications after limb-sparing surgery include nonunion, pathologic fracture, loosening, limb-length discrepancy, endoprosthetic fracture, poor joint move-ment. 145,146On occasion, refractory complications develop after limb-sparing surgery and require amputation.147,148Several studies have compared functional outcomes after amputation and limb-sparing surgery, but results have been limited by inconsis-tent methods of functional assessment and small cohort sizes. Overall, data suggest that limb-sparing surgery results in better function than amputation, but differences are relatively modest. 145,148Long-term quality of life outcomes among survivors undergoing amputation and limb-sparing procedures also have not differedsubstantially. 147 Nephrectomy Nephrectomy remains the preferred procedure for local tumor control of childhoodrenal malignancies. Complications reported in children who have undergone nephrec-tomy include renal insufficiency, hyperfiltration injury, hypertension, and hydrocele. Compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney typically occurs after nephrec- tomy, likely as an adaptation to increase glomerular filtration capacity. 149Chronic glomerular hyperfiltration has been shown to cause focal glomerulosclerosis and inter- stitial injury150that may ultimately lead to a decline in renal function. Microalbuminuria, an indicator of glomerular hyperfiltration, has been observed in up to 84% of cases in postnephrectomy cohorts.151However, nephrectomy without radiation does not seem to lead to hyperfiltration injuries of the remaining kidney.151Diastolic hypertension has also been reported as a late complication of nephrectomy, but primarily in individualswho also received abdominal RT. 152Clinicians should also be cognizant of other therapeutic interventions that may further impair renal function in children who have undergone nephrectomy, including nephrotoxic chemotherapy aminoglycoside antibiotics,amphotericin, cyclosporine), and abdominal RT. Renal failure following a unilateral nephrectomy is rare. 153Survivors of Wilms tumor who develop chronic renal failure often have syndromes accompanying WT1 muta-tions or deletions that predispose to renal disease. 154,155The National Wilms Tumor Study Group reported an overall incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of1% for unilateral tumors and 12% for bilateral tumors. However, patients withSurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 767Denys-Drash syndrome, Wilms tumor aniridia syndrome, or associated genitourinary anomalies had ESRD risks as high as 90%.156 Exenteration and Organ-preservation Surgery For many years, the management of genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma in childreninvolved radical surgery to achieve local tumor control, including pelvic exenterationwith removal of pelvic organs. Contemporary multimodal therapy aims to eradicate the primary tumor, treat or prevent metastatic disease, and preserve pelvic organs. 157-159 Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group investigations demonstrated that the use of primary chemotherapy optimizes preservation of bladder and urethral function in boys with prostate/bladder rhabdomyosarcoma without compromising disease control.158,159Conservative surgical intervention with primary chemotherapy and adjunctive radiation also avoids the need for vaginectomy and hysterectomy in girls with vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma tumors.157However, intensive multimodal therapy confers significant risks for treatment morbidity in long-term survivors.160Long-term complications reported after total cystectomy with urinary diversion procedures include chronic urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, renal dysfunction, reservoir calculi, perforation, and of vitamin B12, folate, and carotene.161,162Treatment with partial cystectomy may also result in functional bladder problems related to contracture or incontinence.158,162Multimodal therapy including radiation and the oxazophorine alkylating agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamideincreases the risk of genitourinary such bladder fibrosis andhemorrhagic cystitis. 73 Splenectomy Laparotomy including splenectomy and lymph node sampling was a routine stagingprocedure for Hodgkin lymphoma from the 1970s to 1990, especially in patients treated with radiation as a single modality. The procedure was abandoned as systemic chemotherapy was incorporated into pediatric protocols and advances in diagnosticimaging technology enabled more accurate intra-abdominal staging. Asplenic HLsurvivors remain at risk for infection and overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis throughout their life span. The risk of bacteremia is increased eightfold after splenec- tomy, but vaccinations can reduce this risk. 163Bacteremia most often results from infection with encapsulated organisms are also at risk of infection with other organisms such as Escherichia coli with penicillin (or an alternative agent in children with penicillin allergies) is recommended during child-hood when infectious risks are substantially greater. 165Long-term prophylaxis through the adult years remains controversial166,167because of concerns about inap- propriate use of antibiotics and potential colonization with drug-resistant organ-isms. 164However, all asplenic patients should be given guidelines to follow at the onset of febrile illnesses that emphasize the need for prompt medical evaluation. Due to the risk of rapidly invasive infections with encapsulated organisms, asplenic patients with a temperature of 38.3/C14C (101/C14F) or other signs of serious illness should be evaluated immediately a set of blood cultures should be obtained, a long-acting, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic (eg, ceftriaxone) administered, and the status monitored closely while awaiting blood culture results.Oeffinger et al 768OTHER THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURES: BLOOD TRANSFUSION Childhood cancer survivors transfused before effective screening measures for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk for transfusion-acquired hepatitis.168HBV screening was implemented in 1971 in the United States. HCV screening by the first-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was initiated in 1990; a more sensitive second-generation EIA became available in 1992. Hence, in the United States, survivors who are at highest risk of HBV and HCV were exposed toblood/serum products before 1972 and 1993, respectively. HBV typically has a more aggressive acute clinical course, but a relatively low rate of chronic infection. 168,169In the United States and many other developed countries, routine vaccinations of children and adolescents against HBV has resulted in a lowinfection rate in the general population (<2%). 168In contrast, acute infection with HCV is often mild or asymptomatic, but the rate of chronic infection approaches80%. 169At present, no vaccines are available to prevent infection, but the risk of trans- fusion-acquired HCV has declined significantly over the past 2 to 3 decades because of more stringent blood donor screening regulations.170 The prevalence of HCV infection (positive EIA or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in childhood cancer survivors ranges from 5% to 50% depending on the geographic loca-tion of the treating center. 171-173PCR detection of viral RNA supports a high rate of chronic infection, ranging from 70% to 100%.171,174The rate of progressive fibrosis and end-stage liver disease seems to be comparable to those seen in adult cohortswith transfusion-associated hepatitis, and in hemophiliacs coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and HBV. 171,175Recognizing that some survivors are unsure of whether they received a transfusion or blood product during therapy, the COGrecommends that all survivors who were treated before 1993 be screened for HCV. PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF SURVIVORSHIP Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes, includinganxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), academic and vocationaldifficulties, and barriers to health care access related to inability to obtain adequatehealth insurance. The late psychosocial consequences of childhood cancer therapy are dependent on many variables, including age at diagnosis, family functioning, inten- sity and duration of therapy, and treatment-specific sequelae, such as altered physicalor cognitive functioning. 176 Although most childhood cancer survivors appear to be experiencing good psycho- logical health following their cancer treatment, certain subgroups may be at higher riskfor adverse outcomes, particularly those with a history of brain tumors or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, survivors with a history of HL, sarcoma, and bone tumors have been found to be at increased risk for continuing cancer-relatedanxiety. This finding may be related to most of these survivors being adolescents atthe time of their cancer diagnosis, and therefore having the capacity to understand the life-threatening implications of their illness at the time of diagnosis and throughout treatment and recovery. 6 PTSD has also been identified as a consequence of childhood cancer and its treat- ment. PTSD may manifest as somatic complaints, depression, or anxiety in both survi-vors 177and their family members.178In contrast, some survivors and families have reported posttraumatic growth (eg, positive psychosocial gains, such as enhanced self-concept and a new appreciation for life) related to the cancer experience.179 Nevertheless, survivors and their families may benefit from psychosocial interventionsSurvivorship: Childhood Cancer Survivors 769to assist with ongoing identification and management of therapy-related complications. In terms of social and emotional adjustment, most childhood cancer survivors also appear to be doing well; however, differences in certain subgroups are apparent.180In one study, survivors who received higher-intensity treatments were less assertive inmaking and maintaining friendships, and reported greater feelings of isolation than their siblings. 181Survivors of brain tumors, leukemia, and bone tumors report higher rates of employment difficulties, including unemployment, underemployment, and job discrimination,182which may be attributable to neurocognitive impairment or deficits in motor function. For these survivors, difficulties in obtaining health insurancecoverage may be tied to employment problems and may limit access to adequatehealth care. Although disparities in health insurance coverage seem to be decreasingover time, the cost of premiums for adequate coverage may be prohibitive for some survivors. 183Marital status has also been used to assess social well-being in child- hood cancer survivors, because concerns about fertility and future health of both the survivor and any potential offspring may influence decisions about long-term relationships and marriage.184In general, survivors are less likely to be married than their siblings,185with the lowest rates of marriage occurring among those who received central nervous system-directed therapy and those with bone cancers.186 SUMMARY Late effects of therapy for childhood cancer are frequent and serious. Fortunately,many late effects are also modifiable. Proactive and anticipatory risk-based care can reduce the frequency and severity of treatment-related morbidity. The primarycare clinician should be an integral component in risk-based care of survivors.Continued communication between the ''late effects'' staff at the cancer center and the primary care clinician is essential for optimum care of this high-risk population.
