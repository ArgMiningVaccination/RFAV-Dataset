It is an allergy to a sugar found in most mammals called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal for short). Alpha-gal is not only found in the meat of mammals, it can be found in products derived from mammals. This includes some cosmetics, medications, personal hygiene products, vaccines, and more. Due to the large number of items containing alpha-gal, it can be very difficult to avoid it. Alpha-gal allergy has been linked to the bites of lone star ticks. Research is now pointing to the idea that other insects, such as chiggers can trigger an alpha-gal allergy. Not everyone develops an allergy to alpha-gal after a bite, as there are a multitude of factors involved for the allergy to occur. This includes genetics, overall immune status, and other environmental factors. Treatment for Alpha-gal Allergy At Franklin Acupuncture & Herbal Medicine, we specialize in Soliman Auricular Allergy Treatment (SAAT) for the treatment of Alpha-gal allergy. SAAT was developed by Dr. Nader Soliman, an innovator in the field of auricular (ear) acupuncture. SAAT provides unparalleled results for the treatment of alpha-gal allergy. Treatment Process - The consultation, testing, and treatment is completed at the initial visit, unless the testing indicates that the individual is allergic to anything that will be used on the ear for treatment purposes. Treatment will not take place at the initial visit for patients whose in office testing indicates that they will be allergic to the acupuncture needles or to the adhesives used to secure the needles to the ear. - Patients whose in office testing indicates that they are reactive to either metal or adhesives will need to take sublingual remedies at home and return for treatment at a later date. - Previous allergy testing is not required prior to having treatment at our office, as testing is done in office. Our in office testing in office does not include blood tests or skin prick tests. It involves a very easy and non-invasive form of neuromuscular testing. However, you are welcome to bring previous test results. - The treatment process involves the insertion of tiny (3mm) needles into the right ear. The left ear is only used if the right ear is unable to be used for needling purposes. Each needle is covered by a small piece of medical adhesive and is left in the ear for three to four weeks, depending on the individual. - Patients must return for a recheck to ensure that the treatment has worked. This is done after the needles have been removed. Needles are removed at home by the individual, not in office. - Patients will then re-expose to the treated items per instructions given by the practitioner. - Patients who have had true anaphylactic shock will not be given re-exposure instructions to directly ingest mammal meat again. In these cases, the purpose of the treatment is to no longer have reactions to lesser forms of exposure, such as fumes, cross contamination, and dairy. Treatment Outcome Definition of success: SAAT for alpha-gal allergy is intended to stop reactions to alpha-gal containing items. Blood tests for alpha-gal IGE may or may not change after receiving SAAT for alpha-gal. Patients are provided an alpha-gal exposure plan after treatment, which confirms whether or not allergic reactions are still occurring. Pricing SAAT for alpha-gal is $450. A partial pre-payment of $150 is required to book an appointment. The $150 will be applied to the total due at the initial visit. The price of $450 includes the initial visit (consult, testing, treatment) as well as a recheck visit and a phone follow up. Re-checks are to confirm that the treatment has worked prior to the patient re-exposing to alpha-gal. The phone follow up occurs after the patient has re-exposed to alpha-gal. Treatment price may be more than $450, depending on what the testing shows at the initial visit. Some patients testing indicates that they are reactive to either the adhesives or metal used on the ear for treatment. This increases the treatment price, as sublingual remedies will need to be used at home for about 6 weeks prior to returning for treatment. "}
