Introduction to the Arizona Newborn Screening Program 1.1 Overview For most types of genetic or metabolic disease, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Although babies born with these disorders may appear to be normal at birth, with time the disorder may have a devastating or lethal effect on the infant's health and development. Early screening, detection and treatment of these disorders can, in many cases, result in normal growth and development. Arizona has been conducting widespread newborn screening for certain disorders since 1979. A laboratory in Colorado originally performed screening tests for Arizona newborns. In 1993, the Arizona Legislature enacted legislation requiring the Arizona Department of Health Services to develop and administer a formal Newborn Screening Program. The Arizona Newborn Screening Program was created and is now housed in the Bureau of State Laboratory Services , in the Division of Public Health Services. The Program has enabled the Department to enhance its public health role in the newborn screening process, obtain more timely results from screening, and promote better follow -up for suspected or confirmed cases. In 2006 the Newborn Screening Program expanded its panel of screened disorders to twenty -seven disorders (27) with the addition of tandem mass spectrometry testing and added follow -up for hearing screening to follow -up done for bloodspot disorders. Cystic fibrosis screening was added in October, 2007, completing the panel of twenty -nine disorders. The panel of twenty -nine screened disorders (including hearing loss) was recommended by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children ( SACHDNC) as the original Uniform Screening Panel. In May, 2010 the Secretary added severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) to the panel but Arizona does not yet screen for SCID. The Advisory Committee to the Arizona Newborn Screening Program endorsed the original panel and Rules were written to allow the program to adopt this list of disorders. These disorders were selected because their detection and treatment in the newborn period is effective in preventing severe morbidity or mortality and a reliable, reasonably priced test can be used for screening. The disorders currently on the screening panel are: Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 6 Congenital Hypothyroidism Endocrine Disorders (2) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Sickle Cell Anemia Hemoglobin Disorders (3) Sickle Beta Thalassemia Sickle C Disease Biotinidase Deficiency Other Enzyme Deficiencies (2) Galactosemia Phenylketonuria Amino Acid Disorders (6) Maple Syrup Urine Disease Homocystinuria Citrullinemia Argininosuccinic Acidemia Tyrosinemia Type 1 Fibrosis Pulmonary Disorder (1) Hearing Loss (screening done elsewhere but results of screening reported to the program and follow -up done) Disorder not detected by bloodspot screening (1) Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 7 For most of these disorders, the incidence in the population is rare, but the potential for devastating consequences and the high costs of treating undiagnosed infants who do have the disorders is thought to justify mass screening. Hearing loss is the most common, occurring in approximately 2 - 4 per 1000 births. The Arizona State Laboratory is now designated as the sole testing facility for the program. Fees charged for the testing are used to support the operation of the Newborn Screening Program. 1.11 Program Goals The goals of the Arizona Newborn Screening Program are: 1. To identify newborns with certain, rare disorders and assist families of affected infants so that they receive appropriate and timely treatment to prevent or delay serious medical problems. 2. To identify possible hearing loss before one month of age and link families with appropriate assessment and intervention. 3. To ensure that all newborns referred for a follow -up hearing screen prior to dischar ge return for an outpatient screen and receive appropriate assessment by three months of age and intervention by six months of age. 1.12 Key Roles The success of the Newborn Screening Program depends upon the coordinated efforts of many health care pr ofessionals: Medical Home and/or other Healthcare Professionals Medical Home and/or other Healthcare Professionals are generally responsible for: ordering the screening tests for newborn infants in their care, informing parents about the screening tests, and collection and handling of newborn screening specimens. Practitioners, and/or their contracted laboratories, may collect and send specimens for testing. Practitioners, hospitals and laboratories work together to coordinate timely collection and rapid delivery of acceptable newborn screening specimens to the Arizona Public Health Laboratory (State Lab). Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 8 Providers are encouraged to refer to the test as Newborn Screening, not the PKU test. Although PKU was the first and for a while the only disorder screened, it is now only one of the 29 disorders on the Arizona panel. Screening Laboratory As per ARS \u00a736 -694, the sole screening laboratory is the Arizona Public Health Laboratory (State Lab). The State Lab receives all Arizona newborn screening specim ens for testing of twenty -eight bloodspot disorders. Staff there review the specimens for acceptability, perform laboratory testing, keep records of the tests performed, mail results to submitters and physicians and conduct quality control studies of laboratory methods and practices. Arizona Department of Health Services - Newborn Screening Program As per ARS \u00a736 -694, the Department is responsible for the overall development, implementation, management and evaluation of the Newborn Screening Program. T he Office Chief for Newborn Screening is responsible for the administration and coordination of program operations. In addition, the Chief coordinates resource networks for the specialized treatment and medical management of identified newborn screening disorders, as well as other program consultants and contractors. The Department oversees the collection of revenues from the screening tests. The Office Chief also administers the Follow -up component of the Newborn Screening Program. The Follow -up group has many responsibilities, including, but not limited to: reporting of positive bloodspot results to physicians and parents, tracking infants with positive results to help them get diagnostic testing and appropriate care, monitoring confirmatory testing, and reporting of confirmed cases to national newborn screening databases. They also receive reports of newborn hearing screening and track infants who do not pass hospital screening tests in order to assist families to get further testing and early intervention services when a hearing loss is confirmed. Contracted Specialists The Office of Newborn Screening works with contracted endocrinologists, metabolic geneticists, hematologists, pulmonologists (specializing in the treatment of cystic fibrosis) and audiologists. On behalf of the Office of Newborn Screening, these contracted specialists provide consultation to primary care physicians of newborns or infants with possible disorders or hearing loss. The purpose of consultation is to assure that the medical home checks on the clinical status of the baby, reviews signs and symptoms indicative of a possible disorder or hearing loss, reviews family history, recommends further testing and, if necessary, makes a referral to a specialist for diagnostic evalua tion. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 9 When newborn screening results are highly abnormal and the attempts to contact a medical home are unsuccessful, the contracted specialist may contact the family on behalf of the Newborn Screening Office in order to explain the results to the baby's parents, verify the clinical status of the baby and advise parents to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician immediately. Contracted specialists also provide consultation services to the Newborn Screening Program. These services include ca se review, technical and program support, provision of technical information and recommendations regarding diagnostic testing methodologies, review of educational materials, and attendance at critical meetings where program issues are discussed. 1.2 Key Points about Newborn Screening for Discussions with Parents 1. Every baby is at risk and you can't tell if a baby has a disorder without screening Newborn screening is important for all babies because even without a family history of any of the screened disorders, every baby is at risk. Most babies with a disorder are born into a family with no other affected family members. Most affected babies look healthy at birth. 2. Disorders are serious and can be life- threatening The screened disorders are serious and can cause severe disability or even death if not detected and treated early. For some disorders, symptoms appear quickly and for others the baby appears fine for a while before symptoms appear and by that time permanent damage has been done. Newborn screening is not just a PKU test anymore but includes hearing screening and a panel of 28 disorders detected by bloodspot testing. 3. How the testing will be done A few large drops of blood are obtained by pricking the baby's heel. These blood drops are collected on a special filter paper kit, dried, and sent to the State Lab for analysis. Hearing screening is done when the baby is quiet or asleep by a trained screener using equipment that provides an automated pass or refer result - sound is introduced into the baby's ear and either an otoacoustic emission is measured or an auditory brainstem response is measured from scalp electrodes. This testing is painless and takes only a few minutes to complete. 4. Testing must be timely The first bloodspot test should be done between 24 and 36 hours of age or prior to discharge from the hospital. For some disorders, false negative results can occur with later testing. The second screen should be done at the Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 10 first outpatient visit to the medical home or other healthcare professional or between 5 and 10 days of age, whichever comes first. The hearing test will be done before the baby is discharged from the hospital. Any rescreening should be done within two weeks and diagnostic testing should be done as soon as possible following a failed outpatient screen. Completing diagnostic testing before three months of age ensures that testing can be done without sedation or anesthesia and that early intervention and fitting of hearing aids, if appropriate, can take place before six months of age. Babies that are in the neonatal intensive care unit for more than five days should go directly to a diagnostic evaluation if they fail the inpatient screen. 5. Results of screening tests are reported to the provider who ordered the test but parents will be contacted if there is an abnormal result Parents will not be contacted by the Newborn Screening Program if their baby's results are normal. Providers who order the screening will receive mailed results and providers can request copies of tests ordered by others when they begin care for a baby. All newborn screening results should be documented in the baby's medical record. If results are highly abnormal, parents will get a call from their baby's doctor or from the Program with instructions for immediate diagnostic testing. For borderline results, they will usually be contacted by their doctor and will get a letter from the Program. If a specimen can't be tested (an unsatisfactory or \"unsat\" specimen) or if results show a hemoglobin trait, parents will receive a letter from the Program asking them to contact their b aby's doctor for further information. Screening tests are not diagnostic and abnormal results will occur for babies that do not have a disorder (false positive results). Further testing will be needed promptly . So that parents can be notified, it is im portant for them to submit a current address and phone number on the specimen card. It is recommended that a second contact phone number also be included on the collection card. Results of the hearing screening are recorded on the back of the baby's immu nization card. If the baby does not pass, a repeat test will usually be scheduled at the hospital where the baby was born. The Program does not start follow -up until the baby is a month of age and has not yet passed a hearing screening. 6. Where parents can get further information Hospitals or other health care professionals should give a copy of the brochure, \"Newborn Screening, A Guide for Parents,\" to parents before the Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 11 first newborn screening test is ordered. Hearing screeners should also have a supply of the brochure, \"Universal Newborn Hearing Screening,\" to share with parents at the time of their baby's hearing test. Parents are encouraged to visit the Arizona Newborn Screening Program's website at www.AZNewborn.com where there is more information about the program and links to many other sites with newborn screening information. 1.3 Arizona Newborn Screening History 1.31 Bloodspot Screening History Screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) began in Arizona in the late 60's and early 70's. In 1979 a three- year federal grant from the Office of Maternal and Child Health was awarded to the Colorado State Laboratory to establish a regional newborn screening laboratory. The testing panel was composed of six disorders. In 1989 a test for biotinidase deficiency was added to the panel of tests. In 1993 legislation was passed establishing a Newborn Screening Program in Arizona funded by fees collected for screening. On November 1, 1994 the Arizona Public Health Laboratory began screening for the seven disorders on the Colorado panel and also providing follow -up for abnormal results. A second screen was encouraged but not mandated. In 2001 legislation was passed that increased the screening fees and added congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) to the newborn screening panel. Screening for CAH began in February, 2002. Second screens were now required for all babies. In 2005 legislation again was passed that increased the screening fees and allowed the expansion of the panel to include the 29 disorders in the Uniform Screening Panel recommended by the federal Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children ( SACHDNC). Between July and September, 2006, newborn screening for 20 disorders (fatty acid oxidation disorders, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidemias) was started using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and accompanied the testing by other methods of seven other disorders already on the panel. Follow -up for hearing loss beg an as well. In October, 2007, testing for cystic fibrosis began and Arizona was now screening and doing follow -up for the complete original Uniform Screening Panel. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 12 1.32 Hearing Screening History Newborn Hearing Screening in Arizona began with the Never Too Young (NTY) program in 1985. NTY supported screening children with risk factors for hearing loss. By 1993 it was recognized that half of the babies born with hearing loss had no risk factors and the national move towards universal newborn hearing screening began. New technology made it faster and easier to screen all babies and new research was showing that age of identification of hearing loss was a significant factor in development of speech and language for children with hearing loss. The NTY evolved into the Arizona Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program (AzEHDI). By 2000 all birthing hospitals in Arizona were screening for hearing loss. In 2005 the current law was passed creating the follow -up program. The goals of the program within the Department of Health Services were to: Include parents and professionals on an advisory panel Educate parents, health care professionals and the public about early hearing detection and intervention Mandate reporting of screening and diagnostic testing Institute a centralized system of tracking and follow up to support parents in connecting with screening, diagnostic services and early intervention Today 98% of all babies born in Arizona are screened for hearing loss by one month of age and 97% of babies are screened nationally. The average age of identification of hearing loss was two years of age. Now, with the goals of AzEHDI in place, the average is less than six months of age. New generations of children who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing have a greater opportunity to meet their full potential. 1.4 Statute and Rules 1.41 Arizona Statutes and Authority The statute establishing the Newborn Screening Program, designating the State Lab as the on ly testing facility of the program and requiring hearing tests to be reported to the Program is found in the Appendices or in: ARS \u00a7 36 -694 The statute establishing the newborn screening program fund is found in: ARS \u00a7 36 -694.01 The statute regarding insurance coverage of medical foods is found in: ARS \u00a7 20 -2327 Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 13 1.42 Arizona Administrative Code Rules regarding the Arizona Newborn Screening Program are in the Appendices and also available online at the Arizona Secretary of State's web site: (http://www.azsos.gov/PUBLIC_SERVICES/Title_09/9 -13.htm ). For a discussion of provider responsibilities under these r ules, please see Chapter 3.1 on page 33 and Chapter 5.4 on page 66. 1.5 Newborn Screening Advisory Committee The Newborn Screening Advisory Committee is established by statute ( ARS 36 - 694) to provide recommendations and advice to the Department of Health Services regarding tests that should be included in the Newborn Screening panel. In 2006 the committee recommended the 29 disorders, including hearing loss, of the original core panel of the Uniform Screening Panel from the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. Any recommendation of a test to be added to the panel must be accompanied by a cost -benefit analysis. The committee is chaired by the Director of the Department of Health Services and meets annually. The Director appoints the members of the committee to include: S even physicians representing the medical specialties of endocrinology, pediatrics, neonatology, family practice, otology and obstetrics; A neonatal nurse practitioner; A n audiologist; A representative of an agency that provides services under part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; A t least one parent of a child with a hearing loss or a congenital disorder; A representative from the insurance industry familiar with health care reimbursement issues; T he Director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) or the director's designee and A representative of the hospital or health care industry. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 14 1.6 Privacy and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) HIPAA became Federal law in April of 2003. Its goal is to \"provide patients with access to their medical records and more control over how their personal health information is used and disclosed.\" (Source: DHHS, available at http://www.hhs.gov/news/facts/privacy.html ) The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) is considered to be a \"public health authority\" as defined in the act and as such is granted access to protected health information (PHI) when necessary to prevent or control disease or where required by law (federal, tribal, state or local). Each employee at ADHS is trained in HIPAA policies and procedures and any information obtained will be kept confidential. As part of a HIPAA -exemp t public health entity, Newborn Screening is able to lawfully receive or disclose confidential information used in the follow -up process without obtaining consent from parents. Photocopies of the HIPAA exemption may be sent to you as explanation. Please see the Code of Federal Regulations ( 45 CFR 164.512 ) or contact the Program with any questions. See http://www.cdc.gov/privacyrule/Guidance/PRPH.htm for further discussion of public health disclosures. 1.7 Program Fees and Payment Procedures 1.71 Testing Fees Arizona's Newborn Screening test consists of two required screens. The first screen is billed at $30.00 each and the second screen is billed at $40.00 each. Fees support the operation of the Newborn Screening Program, including follow - up for bloodspot disorders and hearing loss. 1.72 First Screen The first bloodspot screen is billed to and paid for by the submitter (generally a hospital, birthing center or midwife) who sends the first specimen for a baby. 1.73 Second Screen The second bloodspot screen may be billed to and paid for by a hospital, midwife, insurance company or other responsible party (parent or guardian of a newborn). Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January , 2011 Page 15 If a baby is still a hospital inpatient at the time of collection of a second screen, the billing will be to the hospital. If a midwife collects a screen from a baby five or more days old, it will be considered to be a second screen and will be billed at the second screen rate. Please submit the following insurance information (or a notation that the family does not have insurance) with all second screens which are not billed to a hospital or midwife: Policy holder's name (as shown on the insurance card) Policy holder's date of birth Policy holder's gender Policy holder's employer and employer's address Policy holder's address if different from mother's address Member I D# Group ID# Insurance company's name Insurance company's billing address Insurance company's phone number Notation of whether the insurance is primary or secondary Please do not attach insurance information to the bloodspot card with staples. Place the insurance information with the cards or use paperclips, but these are not necessary. If this information is not received, staff from the Program will contact physicians and facilities to obtain the information. 1.74 Recall Screen After the second screen, a recall test for a specific disorder may be requested in response to an abnormal or borderline result. There is no fee for this test. A supplementary specimen kit should be used to collect the specimen and the Recall box above the Baby's Name field should be marked and the disorder being retested should be written on the line next to the box. Only a test for the requested disorder will be reported. Otherwise, if the specimen is not marked as a recall, it will be considered a billable specimen. 1.75 Insurance Coverage Practitioners should encourage parents to add their newborns to their insurance as soon as possible after the birth since insurance payments cannot be made on behalf of infants until they are listed as insured. Complete insurance information as listed above (in Chapter 1.73) should be submitted with second screens. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 16 1.76 Payment to the Department The Department will bill for first and second screens at least monthly. Payments are due to the Department within 30 days of the billing date.

In May, 2010 the HHS Secretary endorsed this panel along with the addition of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). This panel is recommended for all state newborn screening programs and is also endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the March of Dimes. Arizona does not yet screen for SCID. Early identification and lifelong treatment of these disorders can help to prevent many of the harmful consequences of the disorders and in many cases affected babies can grow and develop normally. Endocrine Disorders Endocrine disorders occur when one or more of the body's hormones cannot be produced while others are overproduced. Hormones regulate metabolism and are necessary for the normal function of the body's organs. (2 disorders) Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) A common*, endocrine condition resulting from deficient thyroid hormone secretion. It is not often an inherited condition and is most commonly caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to develop properly. If undetected, developmental delays, poor growth and mental retardation develop before diagnosis is made and most of this damage is not reversible with treatment. A newborn with CH may have feeding problems, lethargy, hypotonia, jaundice and constipation. Treated with daily oral doses of thyroid hormone. If treatment begins by two weeks of age a baby can develop normally. R isk of this disorder is detected by an immunoassay for elevated thyr oid stimulation hormone (TSH) . hyperplasia - 21-hydroxylase deficiency common*, inherited group of disorders (autosomal recessive) marked by deficiency or absence of one or more enzymes essential to the production of a drenal cortex hormones. The enzyme involved most commonly is steroid 21 -hydroxylase. This results in the inability to synthesize cortisol, aldosterone or both and also results in an overproduction of adrenal androgens. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 20 Symptoms include ambiguous genitali a in girls and in the salt -wasting form of the disorder, vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia and hypokalemia), hypotension, shock and even death within 2 weeks of birth. Treated with hormone and electrolyte replacement with possible surgery for virilized females. Early treatment can prevent salt -wasting crises and gr owth and development problems. R isk of this disorder is detected by an immunoassay for elevated 17 - hydroxyprogesterone (17- OHP) . Hemoglobin Disorders Hemoglobinopathies are disorder s of the red blood cells and in varying degrees affect the transport of oxygen to cells of the body. (3 disorders) Sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) A relatively common*, inherited red blood cell disorder (autosomal recessive) marked by sickling of the cells and chronic hemolytic anemia. It is caused by a mutation of both copies of the gene controlling the structure of hemoglobin chains. S ymptoms include intermittent severe pain, infection, damage to organs, jaundice, stroke and early death. T reated with prophylactic penicillin (to prevent bacterial infections), pain medications, timely vaccinations, education of parents to recognize when their child needs prompt medical care, blood transfusions and sometimes bone marrow transplants. Careful medical supervision can prevent or reduce the number of painful crises and subsequent organ damage. R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FS by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Sickle beta thalassemia (Hb S/Th) R are*, inherited red blood cell disorders in which sickle genes are inherited along with genes that impair the production of hemoglobin (thalassemia). In the most serious form, normal beta hemoglobin is completely absent. This is referred to as S/\u00b0 thalassemia or S/\u00b0 thal. When some normal chains are produced but in decreased amount it is called S/+ thalassemia (S/+ thal) which can cause milder symptoms, depending on the amount of normal hemoglobin produced. S ymptoms and treatment are similar to or can be milder than those of sickle cell anemia and include splenomegaly . R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FS or FSA by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 21 Sickle C disease (Hb S/C) A rare*, inherited red blood cell disorder (hemolytic anemia) with he moglobins S and C present in the absence of Hb A. S ymptoms are variable and can be much milder than for sickle cell disease but some individuals with SC disease can have serious symptoms . T reatment of symptoms is similar to treatment of the same symptoms o f sickle cell disease . R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FSC by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Other Enzyme Deficiencies (2 disorders) Biotinidase deficiency (BIO) A rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs w hen the enzyme, biotinidase, necessary to recycle the vitamin biotin is missing or not working properly. Free biotin is needed as a cofactor for carboxylase enzymes and if it cannot be freed from its bound form by biotinidase it is not available to be use d as a cofactor. S ymptoms which usually appear in a few months of age include seizures, hypotonia, hair loss and skin rashes. Untreated, developmental delays, speech problems, hearing loss and ataxia develop. T reatment is daily supplementation with biotin. R isk of this disorder is detected by a colorimetric enzyme assay for biotinidase activity. Galactosemia (GALT) or classic galactosemia. A rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) marked by the inability to metabolize galactose because of a deficiency of the enzyme, galactose -1- phosphate uridyl transferase (Gal -1-PUT), which to convert galactose to glucose . S ymptoms which st art in the first week of life include jaundice, vomiting and feeding problems leading to failure to thrive or even death. Even with treatment (a diet without any galactose), many affected children have some development delay or mental deficit, speech or language problem s, cataracts or enlarged liver. R isk of this disorder is detected by an enzyme assay for Gal -1-PUT activity. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 22 Amino Acid Disorders Amino acidopathies are disorders of amino acid metabolism that occur when enzymes needed to break down specific amino acids or eliminate nitrogen from the body are deficient or absent. Toxic levels of amino acids or ammonia accumulate and cause brain damage and even death. (6 disorders) Phenylketonuria (PKU) A relatively common*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase, necessary to break down phenylalanine, is missing or not working properly . W ithout early detection and treatment, permanent mental retardation, behavioral problems and eczema develop after a few months. Newborns with PKU seem healthy and symptoms do not appear until irreversible damage has been done. T reatment is a low protein diet with most protein provided in a phenylalanine- restricted formula. If treatment is started early, babies develop normally and have normal IQ. R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated phenylalanine by MS/MS. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, necessary to break down ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine and valine, is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms develop w ithin the first week of life - feeding intolerance, vomiting, lethargy and progress to irreversible mental retardation, seizures, coma and death. T reatment is a low protein diet with most protein provided in a formula restricted in branched- chain amino aci ds and dietary monitoring to prevent metabolic crises . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated leucine by MS/MS. Homocystinuria (HCY) A lso called cystathionine -synthase deficiency or deficiency . A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, cystathionine -synthase, necessary to break down methionine, is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms develop slowly and include developmental delay, mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities (marfanoid appearance), osteoporosis, blood clots and dislocated lens in the eye. T reatment is a low protein diet with most protein provided in a methionine- restricted formula. Vitamin B6 may be given along with other vitamin supplements. R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated methionine by MS/MS. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 23 Citrullinemia (CIT 1) A rare*, inherited urea cycle disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, argininosuccinic acid synthetase, necessary to excrete the nitrog en from amino acids as urea, is missing or not working properly . C risis symptoms of hyperammonemia, which can appear in the first week of life, start with loss of appetite, lethargy, hypotonia and vomiting and progress to seizures and coma. Prolonged peri ods of hyperammonemia can cause brain damage (intellectual disability). T reatment is a low protein diet and special formula, supplementary arginine and other medications along with avoiding going without eating for very long . R isk of this disorder is detec ted wit h elevated citrulline by MS/MS. Argininosuccinic that when the enzyme, argininosuccinyl -CoA lyase, necessary to excrete the nitrogen from amino acids as urea, is missing or not working properly . C risis symptoms of hyperammonemia, which can appear in the first week of life, start with loss of appetite, lethargy, poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature, hypotonia and vomiting and progress to seizures and coma. Prolonged periods of hyperammonemia can cause brain damage (intellectual disability) and developmental delay. T reatment is a low protein diet and special formula, supplementary arginine and other medications along with avoiding going without eating for very long . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated citrulline by MS/MS. Tyrosinemia Type 1 (TYR 1) A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, necessary to break down tyrosine, is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms develop in the first months of life but are not present immediately after birth. Untreated, a baby with tyrosinemia will develop liver disease (enlarged liver, jaundice, cirrhosis) and kidney damage leading to death. Early symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability and failure to thrive . T reatment includes medication, a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine and possibly a liver transplant . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated tyrosine by MS/MS. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 24 Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs or FODs) occur when fatty acids cannot be completely metabolized to produce energy because of defects in enzymes needed for this conversion. When the body's supply of glucose and glycogen are expended, fatty acids are broken down to supply energy during periods of fasting or increased energy demands (fever, stress). Different defects in the fatty acid oxidation pathway prevent the complete breakdown of fatty acids to produce energy and a sudden crisis occurs which can leave an affected infant or child dead or with brain damage. These conditions can yield false negative results if screening occurs after a baby is well fed. (5 disorders) Carnitine Uptake Defect (CUD) A lso known as primary carnitine deficiency or carnitine transporter deficiency . A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that is caused by a defect in the carnitine transporter that moves carnitine across the plasma membrane into cells and retains carnitine in cells. Carnitine is needed for acylcarnitine formation to transport fatty acids into mitochondria where they can be broken down. S ymptoms which begin in infancy or early childhood include cardiomyopathy, confusion, vomiting, muscle weakness and hypoketotic hypoglycemia in acute episodes. Untreated these can lead to heart failure, encephalopathy, liver problems, coma and sudden death. T reatment with supplementary carnitine, a low -fat diet and avoiding fasting (frequent feedings) can prevent metabolic crises. R isk of this disorder is detected with lowered C0 (free carnitine) by MS/MS. occurs when the enzyme, medium chain acyl -CoA dehydrogenase, necessary to break down fatty acids of medium chain length (4 to 12 carbons long), is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms present acutely with fasting and include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, hepatomegaly and death. A voiding fasting (frequent feedings) and a low -fat diet can prevent metabolic crises. R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C8 by MS/MS. Very long- chain acyl A inherited disorder (autosomal when the enzyme, very long chain acyl -CoA dehydrogenase, necessary to break down long chain fatty acids (12 to 18 carbons long), is missing or not working properly .

A voiding fasting and a low -fat diet (supplemented with MCT oil and co rnstarch), can prevent metabolic crises . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C14:1 by MS/MS. Long- chain 3 -OH acyl -CoA (LCHAD) A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, long chain L -3-hydroxyacyl -CoA dehydrogenase, necessary to break down certain fatty acids (between 12 and 18 carbons long), is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms include hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, lethargy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia. A voiding fasting (frequent feedings) and a low -fat diet (low in long chain fatty acids and supplemented with MCT oil and cornstarch), can prevent metabolic crises. R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C16OH by MS/MS. Trifunctional protein deficiency (TFP) A lso called mitochondrial trifunctional deficiency . A very rare*, inherited disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when a protein containing three enzymes (long chain 3 -hydroxyacyl -CoA dehydrogenase, long chain enoyl -CoA hydratase and long thiolas e) necessary to break down long -chain fatty acids is missing or not working properly . A voiding fasting (frequent feedings) and a low -fat diet (low in long chain fatty acids and supplemented with MCT oil and cornstarch), can prevent metabolic crises. R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C16OH by MS/MS. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 26 Organic Acid Disorders Organic acidemias (OAs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that occur when certain enzymes involved in the breakdown of amino acids and other substances are not functioning properly. Toxic acids build up in the blood and spill into the urine (metabolic acidemia). Without treatment and prevention of acute episodes, these disorders can lead to coma and death during the first days or weeks of life. (9 disorders) Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) A very rare*, inherited disorder occurs when the enzyme, isovaleryl -CoA dehydrogenase, necessary to break down leucine, is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms include metabolic ketoacidosis, poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, rapid shallow breathing, \"sweaty feet\" odor, hyperammonemia, coma and death .

Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 28 Propionic acidemia (PROP) A very rare*, inherited disorder occurs when the enzyme, propionyl -CoA carboxylase, necessary to break down a product of protein and fat metabolism is missing or not working properly . S ymptoms usually appear during the first week of life and include poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia and metabolic ketoacidosis which can lead to coma and death. T reatment includes avoidance of fasting and a protein- restricted diet to prevent metabolic crises . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C3 by MS/MS. Beta -ketothiolase deficiency (BKT) A very rare*, disorder (autosomal recessive) that occurs when the enzyme, -ketothiolase, necessary to break down isoleucine, is missing or not working properly. This disorder also impairs the body's ability to process ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fat s. S ymptoms usually appear during the first year of life and include lethargy, vomiting, seizures, and metabolic acidosis (during a period of fasting or illness) which can lead to coma and death. Long term complications include developmental delay, cardiomyopathy and hypotonia. T reatment includes avoidance of fasting and a low protein diet to prevent metabolic crises . R isk of this disorder is detected with elevated C5:1 by MS/MS. Pulmonary Disorder (1 disorder) Cystic fibrosis (CF) A relatively common*, inherited disorder a protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is absent or does not work properly in the regulation of the movement of chloride ions through cell membranes. Thi s causes the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs lungs, pancreatic ducts and other organs . S ymptoms include salty sweat, failure to thrive, lung and sinus infections, intestinal problems (diarrhea or constipation, pain, gas). Many babies with CF are born with meconium ileus. T reatment includes a higher -calorie diet, extra fluids, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, airway clearance therapy and medications (bronchodilators, mucus thinners and antibiotics). R isk of this disorder is detected by an immunoassay for elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) followed by a DNA analysis of the highest 2.2% of the IRT samples for 46 mutations to the CFTR gene. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 29 Disorder Not Detected by Bloodspot Screening (1 disorder) Hearing loss (HEAR) A common* disorder that is both inherited and due to environmental causes . D efined as hearing loss that is permanent, bilateral or unilateral, sensorineural or conductive, and averaging loss of 30 decibels or more in the frequency range important for speech recognition. Although not required by statute, hearing screening is done in all birthing hospitals in Arizona as a standard of care. Reporting of hearing screening results to the Newborn Screening Program is required and follow -up is done for babies who do not pass a hearing screening and do not return to the hospital for further testing. Hearing loss is not usually diagnosed until 2 or 3 years of age without early screening programs. By that time speech and language development is delayed or impaired. Early detection and intervention helps affected infants learn speech and language.

Other disorders or even carrier states may cause abnormal results and these results would be reported and followed until a diagnosis is made and a core disorder ruled out. Secondary target disorders are defined as disorders that can be detected in the differential diagnosis of a core disorder. 2.21 Other Disorders and Incidental Findings Some of the secondary disorders that have been detected by the Arizona Newborn Screening Program along with incidental findings (carrier states) include: Non-classical CAH Hyperphenylalaninemia Hypermethioninemia Partial Fibrosis carrier Other d isease carriers Other hemoglobin diseases Hemoglobin traits 2.22 Other Hemoglobin Diseases Other hemoglobin diseases and traits are detected because the hemoglobin screening is not specific to the three sickling disorders on the Arizona panel. These include: Sickle/Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (S -HPFH) A much milder form of sickle cell disease with no Hb A produced but fetal hemoglobin amounts that do not decline with time. R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FS by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Hemoglobin C Disease A n inherited red blood cell disorder (autosomal recessive) marked by target cells and chronic hemolytic anemia. It is caused by a mutation of both copies of the gene controlling the structure of hemoglobin chains . It occurs most often in individuals of African descent and is characterized especially by splenomegaly, arthralgias, abdominal pain and the presence of target cells and hemoglobin C in the blood. R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FC by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 31 Alpha Thalassem ia A hereditary hemolytic anemia marked by a decreased rate of synthesis of the globin chains of hemoglobin. Four gene deletions produce alpha thalassemia major which is incompatible with life. Affected infants are stillborn or born with severe hydrops fetalis (abnormal accumulation of fluid in the entire body of the infant) and die quickly. If transfusions are given prenatally and continued throug hout life, a baby can survive. Three gene deletions produce Hemoglobin H disease, two produce alpha thalass emia trait, and one the \"silent carrier.\" Hemoglobin H Disease A n inherited red blood cell disorder (autosomal recessive) marked by chronic hemolytic anemia. It results from only one working copy of the gene controlling alpha globin synthesis (3 gene deletions or two gene deletion and one non- deletional mutation). It is marked by hypochromic red blood cells with inclusions that cause them to resemble golf balls (Hemoglobin H is unstable and cannot be quantified by laboratory methods). R isk of this disorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FA plus Barts (in a concentration of at least 15% of total hemoglobin) by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Hemoglobin H - Constant Spring Disease A chronic inherited hemolytic anemia resulting from only one working co py of the gene for alpha globin synthesis and a structural defect called Constant Spring in one of the non- working copies of the gene. It is a more severe form of Hemoglobin H disease with variable consequences up to transfusion dependency. R isk of this d isorder is detected by a hemoglobin result of FA + Barts (in a concentration of at least 15% of total hemoglobin) by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Beta Thalassemia ( thal) A hereditary hemolytic anemia marked by a decreased rate of synthesis of the gl obin chains of hemoglobin. The homozygous form (Cooley's, Mediterranean or erythroblastic anemia) in which globin is completely absent is also referred to as \u00b0 thalassemia or \u00b0 thal). The NBS hemo globin result would be F only. When some beta chains a re present but in decreased amount it is called + thalassemia or + thal). The NBS hemoglobin result would be FA or possibly F only). In an older individual, there would be increased amounts of Hb A2. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 32 2.23 Hemoglobin Traits Sickle Cell Trait A condition in which one sickle gene mutation is inherited along with a normal gene for globin chain structure. This trait is usually a very mild condition and most people with sickle cell trait never even know that they have it. However, in rare cases a person with sickle cell trait can have problems at high altitude or when exercising hard in hot weather when not drinking enough water. R isk of this trait is detected by a hemoglobin result of FAS by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. Alpha Thalassemia Trait A condition in which an individual inherits only two working genes for alpha globin chain synthesis. Individuals with this condition will have a mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia. This decrease in alpha globin chain production does not lead to health problems. Asians with alpha thalassemia trait usually, but not always, have the two non-working genes on the same chromosome (cis -type) making it possible to have a child with hydrops fetalis. African Americans with alpha thalassemia trait usually, but not always, have the two non -working genes on different chromosomes (trans -type) and therefore can only transmit one non-working gene to their offspring. R isk of this trait is detected by a hemoglobin result of FA plus Barts (in a concentration of at least 10% of total hemoglobin) by isoelectric focusing and HPLC. See the Appendices for the Arizona Hemoglobin Barts Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers. Other Traits Other traits like Hemoglobin C Trait, Hemoglobin D or G trait, Hemoglobin E trait or Unidentified Traits can be identified. These do not usually have any health problems other than a mild anemia that is not responsive to iron therapy. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 33 CHAPTER 3 Bloodspot Screening 3.1 Provider Responsibilities Providers are responsible for timely collection of properly identified and acceptable newborn screening specimens, rapid transfer of specimens to the State Lab and follow -up on abnormal results. 1. Order a newborn screening test for each newborn and provide parents with information about newborn screening at the time the test is ordered. The brochure, \"Newborn Screening, A Guide for Parents,\" is included in the Appendices and copies can be ordered at no charge for distribution to parents using the brochure order form in the Appendices. If parents refuse to have their newborn tested, the provider ordering the screen is responsible for documenting the refusal and submitting a collection kit with identifying information but no blood to the State Lab. A sample refusal form is included in the Appendices. 2. Fill out each specimen card completely. See the Appendices for sample specimen cards. Instructions for completing the demographic information on the card are in Chapter 4.4 on page 50. 3. Collect an acceptable blood sample following the instructions in Chapter 4.2 on page 4 8. Posters showing acceptable and unsatifactory specimens and specimen collection steps are available on our website, www.AZNewborn.com 4. Collect a timely specimen following instructions in Chapter 4.6 on page 57. First specimens must be collected, according to whichever of the following occurs first: o 24 to 72 hours of age (closer to 24 hours is recommended) o Before a transfusion o Before discharge from the hospital See Chapter 4.7 and 4.8 on page 59 for special considerations for sick, low birth weight or preterm infants. Second specimens should be collected: o B etween 5 to 10 days of age, or o At the first visit to the medical home or other health care professional (even if this visit is before 5 days of age) o U nless you verified that another provider collected the 2nd specimen. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 34 Arizona requires healthcare providers to order a second newborn screening test for babies who enter their care and are not yet one year of age unless previous t est results are verified. Submitters of second screens must also submit payer information so that responsible parties (parents or insurance carriers) can be billed for screening. 5. Promptly send specimens to the State Lab. Submitters should send each spec imen to the State Lab no later than 24 hours or the next working day after the blood sample is collected. See Chapter 4.6 on page 57 for more information about timely handling of specimens. 6. Receive a copy of the newborn screening test results and document them in the baby's medical record. 7. Follow -up on positive newborn screening results, order appropriate additional testing and refer the baby to a specialist, if needed. 8. Send copies of results from subsequent tests performed at labs other than the State Lab in response to an abnormal screening test to the Newborn Screening Program. Our fax number is 602- 364-1495. Please refer to the Arizona Administrative Code (Public Services, Title 9, Section 9 -13) for the Newborn Screening rules. See the Appendices for a full copy of the rules. 3.2 Obtaining a Submitter Code Each entity that sends specimens to the State Lab or receives test results from the State Lab must have a unique identification code. This code is assigned by the Demographics unit of the Newborn Screening Program and must appear on each newborn screening specimen collection kit submitted to the State Lab. If you are a new provider you will need to obtain a submitter code. Please call the Demographics unit at 602- 364-1468. You will need to provide complete contact information including practice name (if applicable), mailing address, telephone and fax numbers. This information needs to be updated if anything changes since it is the information used to mail results and contact submitters when specimens are unsatisfactory or abnormal. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 35 3.3 Ordering NBS Supplies and Education Materials 3.31 Collection Kits and Envelopes Newborn screening collection kits and other supplies can be ordered by submitters at no charge to them. Remember that kits expire and cannot be tested past the expiration date (found above the circles for blood on the filter paper portion of the kit). Please do not order more specimen cards than can be used promptly. Always check to be sure that the kits h ave not expired before using. Store kits on end, not stacked flat so that the filter paper is not compressed by the weight of kits on top of them. Linked kits and pink envelopes are sent to hospitals only. The first specimen is collected on the top kit marked 1 and the bottom kit marked 2 is placed in the pink envelope and sent home with the baby. Parents should be instructed to bring this kit to their first doctor's appointment. Supplemental kits are single kits which can be used for any screen. Above the baby's name field in the top left part of the form are check boxes to indicate what type of screen is being submitted. Please be sure to mark this area when using a supplemental kit. There are some supplemental kits circulating without the check boxes. Please note the type of specimen submitted on these forms and the disorder to be tested if it is a recall screen. White envelopes are used for mailing specimens to the State Lab. Up to 4 kits can be sent in each envelope. Submitters who use a courier or FedEx will not need these envelopes. Hospitals can arrange for FedEx pickups paid for by the Program by calling the State Lab Receiving Dept. at 602- 542-1190 or E -mail to labreceiving@azdhs.gov . Fill out the order form in the Appendices and fax it to State Lab Receiving at (602)364- 0758 or go online to www.aznewborn.com to obtain an electronic copy which can be completed and attached to an E -mail to labreceiving@azdhs.gov . Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 36 3.32 Brochures Newborn screening parent brochures can also be ordered by submitters at no charge to them. Fill out the brochure order form in the Appendices and fax it to the Newborn Screening Program at (602) 364- 1495 or go online to www.aznewborn.com to obtain an electronic copy which can be completed and attached to an E- mail to nbs@azdhs.gov 3.4 Results and Follow -up 3.41 Results and Reference Ranges Printed reports of newborn screening results are mailed to submitters and health care professionals listed on the specimen collection kit. Each mailer has a disclaimer reminding providers that these results are from screening tests and are not diagnostic of any condition nor can they rule out the possibility of any screened disorder. Normal results are reported by disorder group and do not show actual values. Abnormal results are given for a disorder listed within a disorder group with a footnote requesting appropriate action. If a result in a group is not specified as abnormal, it is normal. For example, there are six amino acid disorders in that group and if the phenylalanine result is shown, it is an abnormal test for PKU. The other five disorders are not shown and they are normal. Please see the Appendices for sample mailers. Reference ranges are listed on the back of the mailer. Further information about analytes, assays and reference ranges by disorder are shown in table form: Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 37 Arizona Newborn Screening Program: Analytes, Assays and Reference Ranges by Disorder Disorder Analyte Assay Reference Range Abnormal Result Endocrine Disorders CH time resolved < screen: U/mL 20 - 59.9 CAH 17-OHP time resolved fluoro Hb IEF & HPLC Normal Hb present (FA) F only, Fx, FAx where x is a variant Hb (S, C, D, E, G, U, Deficiencies BIOT biotinidase equal to control - enzyme activity present enzyme activity absent pale mg/dL mol/L mol/L < 0.60 TFP Organic Acid Disorders IVA C5 tandem mass spectrometry < 0.25 mol/L 0.25 mol/L Pulmonary Disorder CF IRT DNA PerkinElmer AutoDelphia\u00ae time resolved fluoro - immunoassay for IRT/ Third Wave CFTR mutation assay IRT in lower 97.8% of batch or < 65 ng/mL: CF not indicated by IRT or IRT in upper 2.2% of batch and no mutations found One mutation detected Two mutations detected Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 38 3.42 Follow -up on Abnormal Results The Follow -up Section is responsible to contact primary care providers to ensure infants will receive medical evaluation, further testing and/or proper treatment. It is the Program's goal that no infant will be lost to follow -up. Abnormal results are communicated to the Follow -up Section by the Laboratory Section. From there, follow -up staff will take appropriate actions to locate the infant's primary care provider in a timely manner. The follow -up specialist assigned to the case will contact the primary care provider to ensure the infant will receive medical evaluation, further testing and/or proper treatment. Abnormal results are communicated to the primary care provider (and/or the designated nurse practitioner or medical assistant) by phone, by fax and by mail. Follow -up specialists work closely with pediatric endocrinologists, metabolic geneticists, hematologists and cystic fibrosis specialists. These contracted specialists provide guidance to the Follow -up case management team until resolution is reached. The contact information for these specialists is listed in Chapter 1.81 on page 16 of this document; primary care providers are strongly encouraged to consult these specialists on specific cases. Follow -up specialists monitor progress made and only close the case when normal results are received or it is verified that the baby is receiving appropriate care. It is important that physicians communicate results of testing performed at other labs, and the final diagnosis to the follow -up specialist. If the follow -up specialist is not informed of normal confirmatory results, unnecessary phone calls and faxes may be made to the physician or the parents. Providers may request assistance from the Program's Follow -up staff if they are having problems locating parents or obtaining repeat tests for infants. If the infant is no longer under their care, providers should notify the follow -up specialist immediately. If the follow -up specialist is unable to locate the primary care provider; he or she will contact the parent in order to obtain the name of the physician taking care of the baby. At that time, parents are advised to contact their primary care provider for further testing. Lab results are not communicated to the parents, only the fact that the newborn screening results are not normal and further testing is required. When the attempts to contact the parents are unsuccessful, the follow -up staff will coordinate efforts with submitters and other agencies in order to locate parents as soon as possible. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 39 3.43 Follow -up on Hemoglobin Traits Letters are sent to the provider of record and the parents to notify of probable hemoglobin carrier status. There is no further follow -up beyond this notification. Parents are encouraged to talk to their primary care provider about the fact that the results indicate that the baby has a hemoglobin trait. The parent notification letter in English and Spanish directs them to contact the Office for Children with Special Health Care Needs or the Quest to Cure Foundation for more information and resources. Contact information for these organizations is in Chapter 6.3 on page 73. A chart of hemoglobin result mnemonics with descriptions of the probable results is in the Appendices. 3.44 Follow -up on Unsatisfactory Specimens Submitter s and health care providers are notified of unsatisfactory specimens by fax and by mail. Unsatisfactory specimens are not tested by the State Laboratory. The submitter (birth hospital or provider who ordered the screen) is responsible to contact the parents in order to make arrangement for the collection of another specimen as soon as possible. The Follow -Up staff monitors unsatisfactory specimens to ensure that a subsequent valid specimen is received. If a valid specimen is not received within two week s, the infant's medical home or provider who ordered the screen and parents will be notified by mail that a valid specimen has not been received and will urge them to make arrangements for the collection of another specimen as soon as possible. A reminder letter will be sent if a valid specimen is not received thirty days after the date the first letter was mailed. Follow up will be discontinued once a valid specimen indicating normal results are received, or thirty days following the issuance of the reminder letter. 3.45 Referral to Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) The Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) Program provides medical treatment, rehabilitation and related support services as a carveout to Medicaid recipients with qualifying chronic and disabling conditions under age 21. Care is provided to more than 26,000 children and youth with special health care needs (CSHCN) through four family -centered, multi -specialty interdisciplinary clinics. CRS covers o ver 350 chronic and disabling health conditions including cerebral palsy, cleft lip/cleft palate, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and many congenital anomalies. Many CRS recipients are medically fragile and require complex care from multiple pediatric Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 40 physician subspecialists that are frequently in short supply. CRS manages a statewide network of specialists to provide timely access to CSHCN throughout the state. Strategies to ensure access include the use of field clinics in whic h specialists travel to remote areas of the state, as well as using innovative techniques such as telemedicine to minimize travel for both families and physicians. The CRS Program is administered by the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System through a contract with Arizona Physicians IPA. Arizona Physicians IPA -Children's Rehabilitative Services (APIPA -CRS) does not determine eligibility based on income. To be eligible for APIPA -CRS services a child must: Have certain medical conditions, Be under ag e 21, Be an U.S. citizen or qualified alien, and Live in Arizona. APIPA- CRS recipients must be members of an AHCCCS acute care health plan or an Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS) plan, and some recipients may have private insurance as well . APIPA- CRS will coordinate care with the recipient's acute care health plan, ALTCS or private insurance providers. To apply for services, anyone can fill out an application including a family member, doctor, or health plan representative. Along with a com pleted referral/application, medical records that document the child's CRS eligible condition must be submitted. When someone other than a parent/guardian or a family member completes an application, this is called a referral. Referrals/applications to the CRS Program are initiated by submitting a CRS Referral/Application Form. The CRS Referral/Application Form can be obtained from many sources, including physicians' offices, and the APIPA -CRS website at : http://www.myapipa.com/en/members/refer_child.jsp?xlang=en&xrole=me mbers&xstate=az&xplan=uhcaz&xproduct=CRS If you need help completing the APIPA -CRS referral/application or getting information to send in with the application packet, ask APIPA -CRS Member Services for help. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 41 Completed applications can be mailed or faxed to: APIPA- CRS Attn: Eligibility and E CRS Referral/Application Form shall contain the following: a. The name, address, and phone number of the referral source; b. The relationship of the person completing the referral/application form to the applicant ; c. The applicant's name, date of birth, social security number, gender, home address and contact information, race, citizenship, and preferred language; d. If the applicant is a child, the name of at least one parent/guardian of the applicant; e. If known to the referral source: i. The applicant's diagnosis; ii. The applicant's list of allergies if applicable; iii. The applicant's primary care physician or, if the applicant does not have a primary care physician, the name of a health care organization at which the applicant receives medical care; iv. Whether the applicant is enrolled in AHCCCS ( Title XIX or Title XXI) or has other health insurance ; v. Whether the applicant has ever received CRS services before; vi. Whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen or qualified alien; and vii. If a physician has not evaluated the applicant, the reason the referral source believes the applicant may be eligible for CRS. Documentation to accompany the referral/application form for applicants who have been evaluated by a physician: a. Documentation from a physician who has evaluated the applicant that supports the medical diagnosis; b. Diagnostic test results that support the medical diagnosis. Within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of a referral/application, APIPA - CRS will determine whether an applicant is eligible for CRS. The applicant's parent/guardian and referral source will be notified in writing of the decision. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 42 3.5 Flow Chart of the Newborn Screening Process See the Appendices for a summary of the follow -up process es for bloodspot and hearing shown in flow chart s. 3.6 Specimen Retention Newborn screening bloodspot specimens and attached information submitted to the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) are the property of the ADHS. Access to specimens and submitted information is restricted to ADHS employees and contractors approved by the Newborn Screening Program Manager as necessary to meet specific program needs. All applicable laws, regulations and policies safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of medical information are followed by those with access to these specimens and attached information. Specimens are stored at room temperature for 90 days and then autoclaved and discarded. Specimens of interest (confirmed cases) may be frozen and retained for quality assurance purposes. During the storage period and after the newborn screening tests are complete, residual dried blood may be used for lab methodology development or validation or other quality assurance testing. Specimens may be released to others under certain circumstances including: 1. Written request from a provider, at the request of a parent or guardian. Bloodspot specimens will not be returned directly to a newborn's parent or guardian. 2. Written request from the Office of the Medical Examiner. 3. To named persons in a court order or subpoena. 3.7 Frequently Asked Questions What is the chance that an infant will have a disorder detect ed by newborn screening? The combined risk of having one of the 29 disorders on the panel is greater than 1 in 500. What if an infant has a family history of a disorder detected by newborn screening? This family should arrange for diagnostic testing with an appropriate specialist and not wait on a newborn screening result. The possibility of this disorder should be considered by any provider of care to the baby. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 43 What about false positive results? In any screening tests there will be some false positive s. Repeat testing should show that the baby is not affected. Parents should be told that screening tests are not diagnostic and further testing is needed. How likely is a false negative result? False negatives can occur for some disorders when specimens are collected late or early. Early collection (prior to 12 - 24 hours of age) can cause false negative results for amino acid and organic acid disorders because the specific amino acid or organic acid may not have accumulated in sufficient quantity to reach the abnormal range in the first day of life. Collection after 24 hours of age should yield a valid result for these disorders. Late collection of a first screen (after 48 hours of age) can cause a false negative result for fatty acid oxidation disor ders because by this time the baby has been fed and the fatty acid oxidation pathway is not being used as it is when glucose sources have been exhausted. Even with affected babies, a second screen can be normal after an abnormal first screen and this second normal screen does not rule out the possibility of the disorder. Further diagnostic testing is required. Although rare, a false negative is possible for CF if the IRT is not sufficiently elevated in an affected baby and mutation testing is not done. Timing of Specimen Collection A baby who is only 3 days old has come for her first doctor's appointment? Isn't this too early to collect a 2 nd screen? No, the second screen should be collected at this appointment. Improved testing methodology makes earlier testing results valid and reliable. False negatives for some disorders are more likely when testing is delayed. Also, many disorders on the expanded panel can cause damage very quickly if not detected early. There is no longer any advantage to delaying testing. How long should we wait before collecting a second screen for a baby in the NICU? If a baby is still in the hospital at 5 days of age, a second screen should be collected no later than 10 days of age, or prior to discharge, whichever come s first. A baby missed getting a 2 nd screen - is 3 months too old for a second? No, the State Lab will accept specimens from babies up to a year of age. However, earlier testing is recommended as some disorders will show more false negatives when testing is delayed beyond the newborn period. Some other disorders would have already shown symptoms by 3 months of age. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 44 Submitting Specimens for Testing A baby's first screen was unsatisfactory for testing. Do we need to order two more screens for this baby? No, assuming that the repeat test has normal results. Further testing would only be necessary if a result came back abnormal. Be sure to check to see that a CF test was added to the repeat screen. What about screening infants from outside Arizona? For a baby that moves to Arizona, if results of newborn screening from another state are not recorded in the medical record or cannot be verified, a newborn screen should be collected. If a baby is born in Arizona or receives health care in Arizona, a newborn screening specimen should be collected, no matter whether the family lives in another state. What if an infant is adopted? Whose demographic information should be listed in the Mother's Information section? Note that this is an adoption and enter information about whoever has custody of the baby - the adoptive mother, if the baby is with her or the adoption caseworker or agency if they have not y et placed the baby in the adoptive home. The contact information under Mother's Information needs to show a responsible person who could be contacted about the baby if there were abnormal results. What if an infant is in foster care? Whose demographic information should be listed in the Mother's Information section? Enter the CPS caseworker's contact information and note that this is foster care. If the caseworker's contact information is not available, enter the foster mother's name, address and phone number and note that she is the foster mother. The contact information under Mother's Information needs to show a responsible person who could be contacted about the baby if there were abnormal results. Entering \"foster care\" without contact information is not acceptable. Can blood from other than a heelstick be used for newborn screening? Yes, blood obtained by venipuncture is acceptable, although not the method of choice. Indicate on the collection card that blood was obtained by venipuncture. Blood should not be drawn from an extremity or line used for infusion of IV fluids (including blood) without appropriate precautions. Umbilical cord blood is not acceptable. Obtaining Results What is the turnaround time for NBS reports? Once a specimen has been received at the State Lab, testing is usually finished within 3 working days. Reports are mailed the next day and should be received within about 10 days from the date of specimen collection (if it was sent promptly to the State Lab). Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 45 How do I obtain a copy of newborn screening results? Results will be mailed to the provider listed on the specimen collection kit. If you need another copy, please call the Demographics unit and provide them with identifying information about baby and mom. Results will be sent to a new medical home for the baby upon request. The results have arrived but the infant's demographic information is incorrect. What should I do? You can call or fax the NBS Demographics unit and they will correct the information and issue an updated mailer. It has been several weeks since I sent in a NBS sample and I have not received a report. What should I do? Call the NBS Demographics unit and request another copy of the report. Cystic Fibrosis Testing What kin d of DNA testing is done by the Newborn Screening Program? The only DNA testing done by the Arizona Newborn Screening Program is to detect 46 mutations to the CFTR gene. Only those samples that have an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) level will be tested for mutations so for the great majority of babies screened, no DNA testing is done. What does a negative test for CF mean? A negative newborn screening test for CF indicates a much reduced probability that a baby has CF but it doesn't completel y rule out the possibility of disease. The first test for CF is a test for elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). For specimens in the lower 97.8% of the batch the result would be reported as \"CF not indicated by IRT.\" This means that IRT was not elevated and no mutation testing was done If the IRT was elevated (IRT in the upper 2.2% of the batch), the sample would be tested for 46 common CF mutations. If none of these 46 mutations were detected, the result would be reported as \"No Mutations Detected.\" Since there are over 1000 mutations to the CFTR gene, not every mutation would be picked up by our testing panel and cannot be considered \"normal.\" Why is there no CF test on most 2 nd screens? CF testing is only done once for each baby. Usually the first screen is tested and the second is not. However, if a first screen is not submitted or is unsatisfactory for testing, a CF test is added to the second screen. IRT testing is most accurate when done early since IRT falls as a baby gets older, even if the baby has CF. It would be confusing if a first screen test was positive and a mutation was detected and then a second showed \"CF not indicated by IRT\" because the IRT value had fallen into the range where mutation testing was not done. In this case Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 46 the first screen results are accurate and indicate the possibility of CF or CF carrier. The second (although reporting IRT values accurately) is misleading because there is a CF mutation present. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 47 CHAPTER 4 Specimen Collection 4.1 A message from the NBS Office Chief Dear Health Care Professional: Newborn Screening is one of the most important things that can happen to a newly born child. The Arizona Newborn Screening Program is working diligently to make sure every newborn is screened properly, in a timely manner, and affected children have the best outcomes possible. Recently, data have shown that many specimens across the state are being collected improperly and are not being sent in a timely manner. These delays create extreme risk f or a child who is affected with a disease. Earlier collection of properly obtained specimens, with prompt transport to the State Lab can prevent tragic outcomes for Arizona families. The Arizona Newborn Screening program quality measures are as follows: 1. Submitters should have less than a 1% rejection rate for collected specimens. 2. Specimens should be collected within the recommended screening windows. for 1st for 2 screens: 24 - 36 hours of age nd screens: 5 - 10 days of age or earlier (at the first outpatient visit to the doctor) 3. Specimens should be shipped promptly to the State Lab (no more than 24 hours between collection and shipment to the State Lab) Please review the instructions for specimen collection and handling in this chapter with particular attention to Chapter 4.6. Please share these instructions with all staff that collect and handle Newborn Screening specimens and emphasize the importance and urgency of proper specimen collection and handling. If you need further information or assistance with training, please do not hesitate to contact us directly at 602 -364-1409 or visit our website, http://www.azn ewborn.com . With your help, babies can be saved from disability or even death. Your continued efforts are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Ward Jacox, Chief Office of Newborn Screening Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 48 4.2 Newborn Screening Specimen Collection Instructions 1. Use the specimen collection kit supplied by ADHS. Store the kits on end so that the filter paper is not compressed by the weight of kits stacked on top. To order kits and envelopes (US Mail and FedEx), call 602 -542-1190 or use the order form in the Appendices or on the website, www.AZNewborn.com 2. Check the kit's expiration date (on the top left of the filter paper strip above the blood spot circles). Make sure the kit has not expired since expired kits will be considered unsatisfactory by the lab and will not be tested. 3. Check the filter paper for damage (scratched, abraded, torn or creased, detached or partially detached from the rest of the card) and discard the kit if it is not in good condition. 4. Fill out the form completely , printing legibly in dark ink (preferably black) and pressing hard enough so that it is possible to read the bottom copy. Record all requested information and attach insurance information to second screens. Do not use a printer or imprint card. Complete this step before collecting the blood to avoid contamination or smearing of the blood and to ensure the baby is properly identified. 5. Gather supplies, wash hands and put on powder -free gloves (preferred since powder can contaminate the sample). Wash hands and change gloves between babies. Observe universal precautions for handling of blood samples. 6. Recheck the identity of the infant and mother . Make sure that the infant being tested is the one described on the form. 7. Position the infant with the heel lower than the heart. Swaddling with one foot exposed can help to keep the infant comfortable. Warm the heel with a warming device or a cloth moistened with water no hotter than 42\u00b0 C (107\u00b0 F). 8. Choose a collection site on the sides of the plantar surface of the heel (the walking surface), avoiding the center curvature of the heel. See the illustration on the back of the collection kit. 9. Wipe the collection site with 70% isopropyl alcohol or other non- iodine containing disinfectant and allow to air dry . 10. Use a sterile lancet to puncture the skin to a depth of no more than 2 mm. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 49 11. Wipe off the first drop of blood with sterile gauze. This drop contains tissue fluids that can dilute the sample. 12. Allow a large drop of blood to form . Apply gentle pressure to the heel (away from the puncture site) and release as drops of blood form. Do not squeeze or \"milk\" the collection site (this can cause hemolysis and addition of tissue fluids to the sample). 13. Touch the drop of blood to a filter paper circle and allow it to fill t he circle. Do not apply multiple drops to the same circle. Apply blood to one side of the filter paper only. Collect 5 large drops of blood to fill the 5 circles on the filter paper. Fold the protective biohazard flap away from the bloodspots so that it doesn't touch the specimen until it is dry. Do not touch the filter paper with anything but blood drops. Do not write or put stickers on the filter paper. Cord blood is not acceptable. If blood is obtained by venipuncture, do not use tubes with EDTA. 14. Dispose of lancets and other supplies in approved biohazard containers. 15. Air-dry the blood spots on a level horizontal surface . Protect the specimen from heat, direct sunlight or contamination while drying. Do not stack until dry (and the biohazard flaps are in place). 16. Send the specimen to the State Lab as soon as it is dry but no later than 24 hours after collection. Specimens will not be tested if they are received more than 14 days after collection. Do not send specimens in sealed plastic containers, even when completely dry, unless desiccants are included. Hospitals should send a courier or FedEx envelope each weekday so that the State Lab receives specimens each week day. Hospital labs should know when the FedEx pickup is for their facility and ensure that a package is sent out daily. Include insurance information (see section 1.73) with second screens but do not staple paperwork to the collection card. 17. Keep a record of specimens sent . The kit number (or AZ number, found under the bar code and above the blood circles) can be used to track specimens. Use this record to ensure that all results have been received. Call the Newborn Screening Program at 602- 364-3190 or fax a request for results to 602- 542-4099 (include the baby's name and date of birth and either the mother's name and date of birth or the kit number in your request). Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August , 2010 Page 50 18.

See the note below*. 31 Message Phone Enter a number where the mother can be reached if not at her own phone . Or if the mother does not have a working phone number of her own, enter a number where the mother can be contacted (friend, relative, neighbor, etc.). This is important so the mother can be reached if there a re abnormal results. 32 Mom's AHCCCS # Enter the mother's AHCCCS # if the mother is enrolled in AHCCCS. 33 Parent Refused Testing Mark the box if the parent refuses to have the infant screened. Parents should have been informed about the consequences of not screening their infant and their refusal should be documented in the infant's medical record. Most providers will have the parents sign a refusal form that is retained in the infant's medical record. For a sample form, see the Appendi ces. The completed newborn screening kit without blood should be submitted to the State Lab. *If the infant's mother does not have physical custody of the infant, enter the name, address and phone number of the person who has custody. In the case of a baby in foster care, enter the CPS caseworker's contact information and note that this is foster care. If the caseworker's contact information is not available, enter the foster mother's name, address and phone number and note that this is foster care. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 55 In cases of adoption, enter the information for the adoptive mother if the baby has been placed in her care. Otherwise, enter the adoption agency caseworker information and note that this is an adoption. It is extremely important to list contact information for someone who can be reached and who will be able to assume responsibility for follow -up, if necessary. 4.5 Reasons for Specimen Rejection (UNSATS) (With codes for Arizona unsats) Problems with the family or baby UPR Parent refusal Make sure that parents are aware of the consequences of refusing the test. Document the refusal in the medical record, fill out demographic information on the collection card, check the \"parent refused testing\" box in the lower right corner of the card and submit the c ard to Arizona State Lab without blood. UIO Infant too old (> 1 year of age) Newborn screening reference ranges apply only to newborn infants and most accurately indicate risk of disease when specimens are collected early. Serious symptoms of these diseases appear and irreversible damage is done if treatment is not started early. Problems with the card UCE expired collection card CLIA regulations state that valid results cannot be reported if the card has expired. UNI no identifying information Results cannot be reported if the infant cannot be identified. UNO no blood Tests cannot be performed without blood. Problems with collection of the blood UCC clotted or caked blood This happens when a large enough drop of blood is not taken and blood begins to clot before being applied to the filter paper. Uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken from samples with extra clotted blood in some areas of the spot. UIS insufficient specimen The baby didn't bleed well. Not enough blood was submitted to complete the whole panel of tests. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 56 UMA multiple specimen applications Blood may have been applied to both sides of the filter paper or with overlapping drops of blood instead of one big drop in each circle. Uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken for testing. UNS uneven saturation With areas more saturated with blood than other areas of the spot instead of one big drop in each circle, uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken for testing. UTS torn or scratched This usually happens when capillary tubes are used to collect the blood and then it is spotted onto the filter paper. The rough edges of the tubes can easily abrade the filter paper if they are dragged along the surface. With areas where filter paper is missing or bunched up, uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken for testing. UST serum or tissue fluid separation This can happen if the first drop of blood is not wiped away, if a liquid contaminant is allowed to come in contact with the blood spots, if the area around the puncture site is squeezed exces sively (\"milking\"), or if the specimen is dried vertically so that gravity can separate blood components before complete drying. Problems in handling and shipping UTO specimen too old (>14 days from collection date) Blood components degrade with age and exposure to heat and light and cannot be accurately measured. USD specimen detached from form Results cannot be reported if the infant may be incorrectly identified. USC contaminated Filter paper has come in contact with gloved or ungloved hands or substances such as alcohol, formula, antiseptic solutions, water, hand lotion or powder, etc. before or after specimen collection. Contaminated specimens yield unreliable results. Problem in the lab URS results inconsistent Repeat testing of the same sample gives results that are greatly different from one another. This could indicate that the sample was unevenly saturated or damaged in some way. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 57 A one -page summary of these reasons for specimen rejection is found in the Appendices. 4.6 Specimen Co llection and Handling 4.61 Collection and Handling of First Screens You can collect a perfect specimen but if it wasn't collected during the recommended screening window, or if it was delayed in transport to the S tate Lab, a baby could suffer. When is t he best time to collect a first specimen? 24 to 36 hours of age - earlier is now better. 1. Each disorder has a \"best screening window\" where the test is most likely to detect affected infants while minimizing false positive results. These windows are much earlier than those recommended in the past because the disorders detected by tandem mass spectrometry can be accurately detected by 24 hours of age and some of them can harm babies in the first few days of life (so earlier screening is needed). Best screening window 2. The Arizona Administrative Code R9- 13-204 states that a first specimen must be collected between 24 and 72 hours of age, but collection closer to 24 hours is recommended. For all disorders except homocystinuria, ideal screening windows include the time between 24 and 48 hours of age. Waiting until 72 hours is already past the best window for many disorders. Arizona Rules 3. Sick, preterm and low birth weight babies have their own complications for screening and even earlier collection is recommended to avoid interference from therapies like transfusion, parenteral nutrition or treatment with steroids and some antibiotics. Special Considerations How can delays in transport to the State Lab be prevented? 1. The Arizona Administrative Code R9- 13-203 A. 4 states that specimens must be sent to the State Lab within 24 hours of collection or the next business day. Prompt Mailing 2. Each hospital should identify someone with the responsibility to ensure that samples move quickly from the nursery to the lab and shipping area so that Hospitals using FedEx (State paid), Courier or US Mail Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 58 the whole process from collection to shipping takes 24 hours or less. The practice of \"batching\", where a facility delays sample shipment until a predetermined number of samples is collected, seriously increases the risk of irreversible harm or death for those infants born earliest in the batch. Therefore, any hospital with at least one birth a day should send a shipment of samples to the State Lab each weekday, including Friday. 3. For those providers who don't attend at least one birth a day, the requirement is still to ship as promptly as possible. A single specimen sent alone is acceptable and shouldn't be held to be sent with others collected on a later date. Other Providers 4.62 Collection and Handling of Second Screens 1. When is the best time to collect a second specimen? 5 to 10 days of age or at the first outpatient visit to the doctor. Since babies often see their primary care physicians prior to 5 days of age, second screens should be collected at that visit, even though the baby is not yet 5 days old. Second specimens can be collected after 10 days of age (and will be tested if collected up to a year of age). However, later -collected specimens may miss cases of certain metabolic disorders (e.g., VLCAD, MCADD, GA -1) or cystic fibrosis because false negatives are more likely in older babies. For disorders where symptoms are not apparent until irreversible damage has been done (PKU, congenital hypothyroidism) later detection would mean a poorer outcome for an affected infant. 2. For providers who collect their own second screens : Collect the specimen at the baby's first visit and send it to the State Lab as soon as it is dry. A single specimen is acceptable and shouldn't be held to be sent with others collected on a later date. Protect specimens from heat and sunlight. Don't put them in metal collection boxes on outside doors during the summer or drop them in an outside mailbox in the sun. 3. For providers who send patients to an outside lab: Please direct your patients to get the second screen collected as soon as possible. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 59 We have heard that some labs are turning families away if the baby is younger than 2 weeks of age. T his should not happen since earlier collection is now recommended. The Newborn Screening program will be working with the large contract labs to ensure that all of their drawing stations have the latest guidelines. Please let us know if you hear of any parents that have been turned away. The bottom line is that early collection, with no delays in handling or shipping, gives the best chance for a disorder to be detected and treated before an infant is permanently harmed. 4.7 Special Considerations For a baby in the NICU a first bloodspot specimen should be collected prior to transfusion, parenteral nutrition and other therapies, even if it means that the specimen will have to be collected prior to 24 hours of age. The CLSI Guideline for preterm, low birth weight and sick newborns recommends collection of the first screen on admission to the NICU so that it can be obtained prior to any intervention. This guideline recommends a second screen between 48 and 72 hours of age and a third on day 28 or pri or to discharge, whichever comes first. Arizona rules do not have modified requirements for NICU collection. However, they do require the hospital to collect the second screen between five and 10 days of age and before discharge if a baby is still hospitalized at 5 days of age. If a baby is transferred to another hospital prior to 48 hours of age, the receiving hospital is required to collect a first screen, unless the first screen has been collected by the sending hospital. 4.8 Factors Which Affect Test Results or Interpretation 1. Transfusions According to the Arizona Administrative Code (R9- 13-204A), the first newborn screening test should be collected prior to any transfusion, unless specified otherwise by a physician. This is necessary to avoid false negative results for many disorders. Any transfusion of red blood cells (whole blood, packed RBCs or ECMO) can cause false negative results for galactosemia and hemoglobinopathies and this effect lasts until the donor red blood cells have been replaced (3 - 4 months after the last transfusion). Rescreening then would be necessary Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 60 unless a previous screen had been collected prior to transfusion. For both of the above disorder groups a specimen collected prior to 24 hours of age is valid and yields reliable results. Transfusions of whole blood or ECMO (or plasma, for biotinidase deficiency screening) can cause false negative results for all screened disorders for 4 - 72 hours after the transfusion (except for galactosemia and hemoglobinopathies where the effect lasts for 3 - 4 months). 2. Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Parenteral nutrition can cause false positives for amino acids and fatty acids. Multiple amino acid abnormal results can be an indication of excess free amino acids from the parenteral nutrition solution or liver problems (immature enzymes or illness so that liver enzymes can't handle the amino acids fast enough to prevent a rise in amino acid concentration in the blood). Medium chain fatty acids are also added to parenteral nutrition solutions and can be present in higher amounts in the blood. Prolonged PN can lead to carnitine depletion. A false positive result for IVA (elevated C5) is also possible. A repeat screen should be collected 24 - 72 hours after PN is stopped, if a previous screen had abnormal results. 3. Maternal Conditions A mother with hyperthyroidism treated with PTU can deliver a baby with transient hypothyroidism (elevated TSH on the newborn screen). Positive results will occur until the drug clears the newborn's system - between 7 -14 days after birth. A repeat screen or other thyroid testing should be done around two weeks of age. A mother with CAH can deliver a baby with a false positive result for 17- OHP. The newborn should be rescreened between 3 and 7 days after b irth. Transient hyperphenylalaninemia in the newborn is a result of a mother with uncontrolled PKU (high phenylalanine levels). This effect will normalize within 12 - 24 hours, unless the baby also has PKU. A mother treated with steroids during pregnancy can deliver a baby with a false negative result for CAH since steroids can suppress fetal adrenal function. The length of the effect depends on the class of steroid and the dose and is unknown but estimated at 1 - 2 weeks after birth. A repeat screen done later than 2 weeks of age would be needed. Maternal carnitine or Vitamin B 12 deficiencies can cause false positive results for C0 (carnitine) and C3 (Vitamin B 12). The effects can last several days Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 61 depending on the nutrition provided to the newborn (for B 12 deficiency) - the duration of the effect of carnitine deficiency is unknown). Carnitine supplementation can cause false negative results for C0 (Carnitine uptake defect) during supplementation and for some weeks afterwards. It can also cause false positives for other acylcarnitines. This effect lasts approximately 4 days. A mother with 3MCC can have an unaffected baby with elevated C5OH. The duration of this false positive effect is unknown. 4. Sick or stressed infant A sick or stressed newb orn can have elevated 17 -OHP and IRT (false positives for CAH and CF) until recovered. Liver disease and jaundice can cause false positives for many disorders (tyrosinemia, homocystinuria, PKU, CF, biotinidase deficiency) 5. Preterm or low birth weight infa nt Elevated tyrosine and 17- OHP and low biotinidase are common results for preterm or low birth weight babies (false positives for tyrosinemia, CAH and biotinidase deficiency). False positives for amino acids disorders are a result of immature liver enzy mes. A false negative result for hypothyroidism caused by an immature hypothalamic/ pituitary/thyroid axis where TSH does not rise in response to low T4 levels can last for more than a month after birth. Since the newborn screen now measures only TSH, this possibility should be considered for all preterm and low birth weight babies, even though the hypothyroidism is usually transient. 6. Steroid or antibiotic treatment Dopamine therapy suppresses TSH and can cause false negative results for hypothyroidis m until the drug is discontinued. Steroid therapy (including dexamethasone) suppresses TSH and can cause false negative results for hypothyroidism as well as false negative results for CAH. This effect can last for 1 to 2 weeks after therapy has been stopped. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 62 Antibiotics conjugated with pivalic acid (for example, pivampicillin) can elevate C5 (false positives for IVA). This effect lasts until the drug clears the baby's system (at least 24 hours after discontinuing therapy). 7. Early collection (prior to 24 hours of age) False positives for hypothyroidism and CAH are possible because of the normal hormone surge after birth. False negatives for amino acidopathies and organic acid disorders are possible with early collection but specimens collected shortly after 24 hours of age are reliable. 8. Late collection Collection of a first screen after 48 hours of age can show false negative results for fatty acid oxidation disorders. A well fed state can mask indications of a FAOD so it is important that a first screen be collected between 24 and 36 hours if at all possible. If a baby has an abnormal result for any FAOD on a first screen and then has a normal result on the second, that second result cannot be taken to mean that the baby had a false positive on t he first screen. All babies with abnormal results on first screens should have diagnostic testing done to confirm or rule out the possibility of a disorder even though their second screen is \"normal.\" Very few false positive results for fatty acid oxidat ion disorders ever occur. Late collection is also not helpful in identifying disorders that have early crises since results will not be available when symptoms start to appear. Disorders which can have serious consequences if not diagnosed early include galactosemia, MSUD, salt -wasting CAH, urea cycle disorders, organic acid disorders and some fatty acid oxidation disorders. Please see a table in the Appendices summarizing the factors which affect screening results, including timing of the specimen collection. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 63 4.9 Parent Refusal of Screening It is important to convince parents of the value of newborn screening so that they get their babies screened during the best window of time to detect the disorders. Providers are required to order newborn screening tests but parents may refuse testing. If after explaining the benefits of newborn screening and the risks involved in refusing testing, and parents still wish to refuse, they should sign a waiver in which they accept responsibility for adverse consequences. You should check to see that the waiver you ask parents to sign has been reviewed and approved by your legal counsel (See the Appendices for a sample form available as a template for preparing a custo mized form for your use). This refusal should be fully documented in the baby's medical record. The demographic information on a newborn screening kit should be fully filled out and submitted to the State Lab with no blood and the \"Parent Refused Testing\" box in the lower right hand corner of the form checked. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 64 CHAPTER 5 Hearing Screening and EHDI 5.1 Hearing Screening In Arizona approximately 98% of all infants are screened for hearing loss prior to initial hospital discharge. Both Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) and Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) screening technologies are used, sometimes in combination. Nearly all neonatal intensive care units screen with AABR because of the increased risk of auditory neuropathy in this population. In Arizona 3% of infants do not pass the inpatient screen. Those infants in the well baby nursery who do not pass the newborn screen should also receive one outpatient screen within the first week or two post -discharge. Because of the tenfold increased incidence of hearing loss in neonatal intensive care graduates, this population should NOT receive an outpatient screen but should go directly to a pediatric audiologist for a diagnostic evaluation. 5.2 Arizona Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (AzEHDI) Program Goals The goal s of the Arizona Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (AzEHDI) program are: screening all babies for hearing loss by one month of age completing diagnostic testing by a pediatric audiologist b efore three months of age for babies who fail the newborn hearing screen enrollment in early intervention services as soon as possible ( prior to six months of age) after diagnosis of hearing loss AzEHDI is a collaborative program with all agencies, organizations, providers and parents involved in the early hearing detection and intervention efforts in Arizona. Various aspects of the program are funded through federal grants, foundation grants, state funding and donations. The AzEHDI efforts are coordinated through the Arizona Department of Health Services, Newborn Screening Program. Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - August, 2010 Page 65 5.3 A message from the NBS Program Manager Dear Health Care Professional, This notification is a reminder of the Arizona reporting requirements for newborn hearing screening and subsequent tests. Arizona Revised Statute \u00a736- 694, passed in 2005, mandates the reporting of all hearing screening and diagnostic results for both newborns and infants to Arizona Department of Health Services, Office of Newborn Screening. As prescribed by A.A.C. R9- 13-207 (E), all screening and diagnostic hearing evaluations shall be submitted within on e week following the hearing test, even if the results are normal . You can report this information by: Fax (the fastest way): (602) 364-1495 Mail: Arizona Department of Health Services Office of Newborn Screening 250 N 17 th Ave, 1st Phoenix, AZ 85007- 3242 Floor Both screening and diagnostic reporting forms are available on the Office of Newborn Screening website, www.aznewborn.com . Please review the instructions to determine the proper reporting format. We request a copy of the supporting narrative report for any diagnostic evaluation. If you have any questions about the reporting forms or need assistance to determine if a report should be made, please contact us at 602- 364-1409 or toll -free at 1 -800-548- 8381. Our goal is to ensure that infants who fail their hearing screens receive prescribed treatment of intervention services in a timely manner. Your role in the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention process is fundamental to reducing the number of babies who are lost to follow -up or lost to documentation. Sincerely, Ward Jacox, Chief Office of Newborn Screening Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 66 5.4 Provider Responsibilities - Mandatory Reporting Results of all hearing screening and subsequent tests for hearing loss performed on newborns and infants must be reported to the Newborn Screening Program, along with identifying information for the baby and the facility performing the test. Please see the Appendices for the complete reporting requirements in Rules (R9-13-207). Results from each hearing screening or diagnostic test performed must be sent to the Newborn Screening Program within one week of the test date. All tests, even if normal, should be reported. Normal results help the Newborn Screening Follow -up team know when the child no longer needs active follow -up. 5.41 Screening Forms To report any out -patient hearing screening, please submit the Hearing Out - Patient Screening (HOPS) form or the Community Health Center Out -Patient Screening Clinic Form found in the Appendices. Use for reporting screening only (not diagnostic results) Multiple infants can be reported on the same form Include the mother's identifying information Report the results of either the Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) screening or the Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) screening 5.42 Diagnostic Testing Forms Use the referral forms customized by region (Phoenix, Flagstaff, Tucson and Yuma) when referring a baby for a diagnostic test. These forms are found in the Appendices. Refer a child who has been diagnosed with bilateral permanent hearing loss to Early Intervention Services. Report diagnostic test results to the state Newborn Screening Program Results to be reported include: o U nilateral hearing loss o T ransient hearing loss o H earing loss in children from birth to three years of age and o NORMAL results ruling out a hearing loss Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 67 5.5 Statewide Testing Locations Lists of screening and diagnostic testing facilities with phone numbers are available in the Appendices. A map of these screening and diagnostic testing locations in Arizona is found on our website, www.AZNewborn.com 5.6 Hearing Screening and Follow -up The Arizona Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program (EHDI) includes Newborn Hearing Screening Follow -up under the Newborn Screening Program. Follow -up is conducted to meet the goals of: Screening all infants for hearing loss by one month of age Completing diagnostic testing before three months of age for children who fail the newborn hearing screen Enrollment in Early Intervention services as soon as possible (prior to 6 months of age) after diagnosis of hearing loss In order for the Program to know where infants are in the process of ea rly identification and to provide appropriate follow up, it is critical that providers know when and how to report screening and diagnostic results. Screening If infants do not pass their newborn hearing screen in the hospital, it is important that the ba bies are screened again as soon as possible (no later than 1 month of age). Most can return to the birthing hospital for an outpatient rescreen within the first week or two after discharge. If it is not possible or convenient (or for insurance coverage), the provider can refer the infant to another screening location (for a list of resources, please see the Appendices or visit our website at www.AZNewborn.com ). If the infant was screened with the AABR, it is best if AABR is used for the rescreening. NICU graduates (more than 5 -day stay) or infants with risk indicators for hearing loss: Do not rescreen Refer to a pediatric audiologist for diagnostic testing Older infants may need sedation/anesthesia Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 68 Diagnostic testing Refer to a pediatric audiologist if the infant fails an outpatient screen or is a NICU graduate that failed the inpatient screen. Infants may need a referral from the primary care provider. 5.61 Late Onset and Progressive Hearing Losse s Between the newborn period and school age the prevalence of significant hearing loss doubles. This increase in hearing loss is due to: Late onset losses Progressive losses False negative screens Missed newborn screens or loss to follow -up Although some children present with hearing loss and have no risk factors, there are conditions known to cause hearing loss. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommends that these children who pass their hearing screening but have risk factors receive, at minimum, a diagnostic assessment by 24 to 30 months of age.

Results are then confirmed by HPLC. It is a technique for separating different proteins by their electrical charge differences (due to their relative content of acidic and basic side chains). Samples are distributed over a gel medium that has a pH gradient. An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a positive and negative end. Charged hemoglobin molecules migrate toward the oppositely charged end through the changing pH gradient until they reach a pH point that corresponds to their isoelectric points (pI) - the point where they no longer have a net charge. No further migr ation takes place and the proteins become focused into bands at this point.

This results in the excretion of non -amino organic acids in urine. Support group: Organic Acidemia Association http://www.oaanews.org otoacoustic emissions testing (OAE) a method used for hearing screening which measures a response from the cochlea that is generated in response to a sound. An earpiece with a microphone measures the cochlea's response to sound, listening for otoacoustic emissions. If no otoacoustic emissions are recorded, it could mean possible hearing loss. The OAE does not require the baby to respond to sound. A pass result suggests that the cochlea is working normally. A baby who doesn't pass may have a temporary hearing loss because of fluid or it may indicate a permanent hearing loss. P packed red blood cells (PRBC) Transfusion of red blood cells can cause false negative newborn screening results for hemoglobinopathies and galactosemia. A valid repeat screen can be collected 3 - 4 months after the last transfusion. parent refusal Parents are allowed to refuse a newborn screening test for their infant. For documentation, the physician obligated to order the test will have the parents sign a form acknowledging that they understand the possible consequences of not screening their infant. The collection kit has a box to check for parent refusal. The demographics should be filled out compl etely, the box checked and the kit sent without blood to the State Lab. patient number the lab number of the screen (usually a first screen) that a subsequent screen is linked to. When a screen is unlinked its patient number is its lab Arizona Newborn Screening Program Guidelines - January, 2011 Page 105 number. When a screen is linked to another screen, its patient number is the lab number of the screen it is linked to. If the patient number is different from the lab number it signifies that this screen is linked to another. If the patient number is the same as its lab number it shows that it is not linked to any other screen but other screens may be linked to it.

Take steps to ensure that the filter paper is not touched or contami-nated in any way during this process. If a submitter's copy is present, remove it and keep it for your records.Areas on the side of the heel containinghatch marks are acceptable puncture sites. 2 1 3 Warm puncture site for 3-5 minutes with a warm, moist towel no hotter than 42C. 4 Cleanse the puncture site with a sterile alcohol pad and allow to air dry. 5 6 Puncture skin and wipe away the first drop of blood. Allow a second large drop to formLightly touch the filter paper to the second drop of blood. Allow the blood to soak through and fill the preprinted circle. DO NOT APPLY MORE THAN ONE DROP TO A CIRCLE. Fill all remaining circles in this manner. If blood flow is diminished, repeat steps 3-6 with sterile equipment. 7 Allow the speciment to dry in a horizontal position for at least three hours, away from direct contac t with surfaces, heat, and sunlight.Send the specimen to the appropriate location no more than 24 hours after collection.8Blood Spot CheckID Biological SYSTEMS Filter paper circle incompletely filled or not saturated Blood applied to filter paper with needle or capillary tube Contamination of surface of filter paper circleQuantity of blood insufficient Blood applied improperly with capillary tube or by other meansScratched or abraded blood spots Specimen not properly dried before mailingWet or discolored blood spots Excess blood applied to the filter paper, usually with capillary tube or needle Blood applied to both sides of the filter paperSupersaturated blood spots Puncture site squeezed or \"milked\" to expel blood Exposure of blood spots to direct heat Contamination of filter paper before or after blood collection by gloved or ungloved hands or by substances such as alcohol, feeding or antiseptic solutions, hand lotion or powderDiluted blood spots Alcohol not allowed to dry completely before skin puncture is made Allowing filter paper to come in contact with alcohol, water, hand lotion, etc. Squeezing the area around the puncture site excessively Drying the specimen improperly Applying blood to filter paper with a capillary tubeSerum rings evident in blood spots Touching the same filter paper circle to a blood drop several times Filling the circle from both sides of the filter paperClotted or layered blood spots Failure to obtain any bloodNo blood UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS POSSIBLE CAUSESACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN No foreign substances have contaminated the filter paper. The blood fills all printed circles and is applied evenly on one side of the filter paper only, free of layering and clots.

Check the date printed above the circles for blood. UNI No identifying information Results cannot be reported if the infant cannot be identified. UNO No blood on the card Tests cannot be performed without bloo d. Problems with collection of the blood UCC Clotted or caked blood Uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken from samples with extra clotted blood in some areas of the spot. UIS Insufficient specimen Not enough blood was submitted to complete the whole panel of tests UMA Multiple specimen applications Blood may have been applied to both sides of the filter paper or with overlapping drops of blood instead of one big drop in each circle. UNS Uneven saturation With some areas more saturated with blood than other areas of the spot instead of one big drop in each circle, uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken for testing. UTS Torn or scratched With areas where filter paper is missing or bunched up, uniform amounts of blood cannot be taken for testing. This usually happens when capillary tubes are used to collect the blood. The rough edges of the tubes can abrade the filter paper if they are dragged along the surface. UST Serum or tissue fluid separation This can happen if the first drop of blood is not wiped away, if a liquid contaminant is allowed to come in contact with the blood spots, if the area around the puncture site is squeezed excessively (\"milking\"), or if the specimen is dried vertically so that gravity can separate blood components befor e complete drying. Problems in handling and shipping UTO Specimen too old (>14 days from collection date) Blood components degrade with age and exposure to heat and light and cannot be accurately measured. USD Specimen detached from form Results cannot be reported if the infant may be incorrectly identified. USC Contaminated Filter paper has come in contact with gloved or ungloved hands or substances such as alcohol, formula, antiseptic solutions, water, hand lotion or powder, etc. before or after specimen collection. Contaminated specimens yield unreliable results. Problem in the lab URS Results inconsistent Repeat testing of the same sample gives results that are greatly different from one another. This could indicate that the sample was unevenly saturated or damaged in some way.

A monthly by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from POLICY STATEMENT Year 2007 Position Statement: Principles and Guidelines for EarlyHearing Detection and InterventionPrograms Joint Committee on Infant Hearing THE POSITION STATEMENT The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) endorses early detection of andintervention for infants with hearing loss. The goal of early hearing detection andintervention (EHDI) is to maximize linguistic competence and literacy develop-ment for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Without appropriate oppor-tunities to learn language, these children will fall behind their hearing peers incommunication, cognition, reading, and social-emotional development. Such de-lays may result in lower educational and employment levels in adulthood. 1To maximize the outcome for infants who are deaf or hard of hearing, the hearing ofall infants should be screened at no later than 1 month of age. Those who do notpass screening should have a comprehensive audiological evaluation at no laterthan 3 months of age. Infants with conrmed hearing loss should receive appro-priate intervention at no later than 6 months of age from health care and educa-tion professionals with expertise in hearing loss and deafness in infants and youngchildren. Regardless of previous hearing-screening outcomes, all infants with orwithout risk factors should receive ongoing surveillance of communicative devel-opment beginning at 2 months of age during well-child visits in the medicalhome. 2EHDI systems should guarantee seamless transitions for infants and their families through this process. 2007 JCIH POSITION STATEMENT UPDATES The following are highlights of updates made since the 2000 JCIH statement3: 1. Denition of targeted hearing loss The denition has been expanded from congenital permanent bilateral, uni- lateral sensory, or permanent conductive hearing loss to include neuralhearing loss (eg, \"auditory infants admitted tothe NICU. 2. Hearing-screening and -rescreening protocols Separate protocols are recommended for NICU and well-infant nurseries.NICU infants admitted for more than 5 days are to have auditory brainstemresponse (ABR) included as part of their screening so that neural hearing losswill not be missed. For infants who do not pass automated ABR testing in the NICU, referralshould be made directly to an audiologist for rescreening and, when indi-cated, comprehensive evaluation including ABR. For rescreening, a complete screening on both ears is recommended, even ifonly 1 ear failed the initial screening. For readmissions in the rst month of life for all infants (NICU or well infant),when there are conditions associated with potential hearing loss (eg, hyper-www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/ peds.2007-2333 doi:10.1542/peds.2007-2333All policy statements from the American Academy of Pediatrics automaticallyexpire 5 years after publication unlessreafrmed, revised, or retired at orbefore that time.

Diagnostic audiology evaluation Audiologists with skills and expertise in evaluatingnewborn and young infants with hearing lossshould provide audiology diagnostic and auditory habilitation services (selection and tting of ampli-cation device). At least 1 ABR test is recommended as part of acomplete audiology diagnostic evaluation for chil-dren younger than 3 years for conrmation of per-manent hearing loss. The timing and number of hearing reevaluationsfor children with risk factors should be customizedand individualized depending on the relative like-lihood of a subsequent delayed-onset hearing loss.Infants who pass the neonatal screening but have arisk factor should have at least 1 diagnostic audiol-ogy assessment by 24 to 30 months of age. Earlyand more frequent assessment may be indicated forchildren with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,syndromes associated with progressive hearing loss,neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, or culture-positive postnatal infections associated with senso-rineural hearing loss; for children who have re-ceived extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) or chemotherapy; and when there is care-giver concern or a family history of hearing loss. For families who elect amplication, infants inwhom permanent hearing loss is diagnosed shouldbe tted with an amplication device within 1month of diagnosis. 4. Medical evaluation For infants with conrmed hearing loss, a geneticsconsultation should be offered to their families. Every infant with conrmed hearing loss should beevaluated by an otolaryngologist who has knowl-edge of pediatric hearing loss and have at least 1examination to assess visual acuity by an ophthal-mologist who is experienced in evaluating infants. The risk factors for congenital and acquired hearingloss have been combined in a single list rather thangrouped by time of onset. 5. Early intervention All families of infants with any degree of bilateral orunilateral permanent hearing loss should be con-sidered eligible for early intervention services. There should be recognized central referral pointsof entry that ensure specialty services for infantswith conrmed hearing loss.Early intervention services for infants with con- rmed hearing loss should be provided by profes-sionals who have expertise in hearing loss, includ-ing educators of the deaf, speech-languagepathologists, and audiologists. In response to a previous emphasis on \"naturalenvironments,\" the JCIH recommends that bothhome-based and center-based intervention optionsbe offered. 6. Surveillance and screening in the medical home For all infants, regular surveillance of developmen-tal milestones, auditory skills, parental concerns,and middle-ear status should be performed in themedical home, consistent with the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics (AAP) pediatric periodicity sched-ule. All infants should have an objective standard-ized screening of global development with avalidated assessment tool at 9, 18, and 24 to 30months of age or at any time if the health careprofessional or family has concern. Infants who do not pass the speech-language por-tion of a medical home global screening or forwhom there is a concern regarding hearing or lan-guage should be referred for speech-language eval-uation and audiology assessment. 7. Communication The birth hospital, in collaboration with the stateEHDI coordinator, should ensure that the hearing-screening results are conveyed to the parents andthe medical home. Parents should be provided with appropriate fol-low-up and resource information, and hospitalsshould ensure that each infant is linked to a med-ical home. Information at all stages of the EHDI process is to becommunicated to the family in a culturally sensi-tive and understandable format. Individual hearing-screening information and au-diology diagnostic and habilitation informationshould be promptly transmitted to the medicalhome and the state EHDI coordinator. Families should be made aware of all communica-tion options and available hearing technologies(presented in an unbiased manner). Informed fam-ily choice and desired outcome guide the decision-making process. 8. Information infrastructure States should implement data-management and-tracking systems as part of an integrated childhealth information system to monitor the quality ofEHDI services and provide recommendations forimproving systems of care. PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 899 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from An effective link between health and education professionals is needed to ensure successful transi-tion and to determine outcomes of children withhearing loss for planning and establishing publichealth policy. BACKGROUNDIt has long been recognized that unidentied hearingloss at birth can adversely affect speech and languagedevelopment as well as academic achievement and so-cial-emotional development. Historically, moderate-to-severe hearing loss in young children was not detecteduntil well beyond the newborn period, and it was notunusual for diagnosis of milder hearing loss and unilat-eral hearing loss to be delayed until children reachedschool age. In the late 1980s, Dr C. Everett Koop, then US Sur- geon General, on learning of new technology, encour-aged detection of hearing loss to be included in theHealthy People 2000 4goals for the nation. In 1988, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), a divisionof the US Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA), funded pilot projects in Rhode Island, Utah, andHawaii to test the feasibility of a universal statewidescreening program to screen newborn infants for hear-ing loss before hospital discharge. The National Institutesof Health, through the National Institute on Deafnessand Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), issued in1993 a consensus statement on early identication ofhearing impairment in infants and young children. 5In the statement the authors concluded that all infantsadmitted to the NICU should be screened for hearing lossbefore hospital discharge and that universal screeningshould be implemented for all infants within the rst 3months of life. 4In its 1994 position statement, the JCIH endorsed the goal of universal detection of infants withhearing loss and encouraged continuing research anddevelopment to improve methods for identication ofand intervention for hearing loss. 6,7The AAP released a statement that recommended newborn hearing screen-ing and intervention in 1999. 8In 2000, citing advances in screening technology, the JCIH endorsed the univer-sal screening of all infants through an integrated, inter-disciplinary system of EHDI. 3The Healthy People 2010 goals included an objective to \"increase the proportion ofnewborns who are screened for hearing loss by onemonth, have audiological evaluation by 3 months, andare enrolled in appropriate intervention services by 6months.\" 9 The ensuing years have seen remarkable expansion in newborn hearing screening. At the time of the NationalInstitutes of Health consensus statement, only 11 hospi-tals in the United States were screening more than 90%of their newborn infants. In 2000, through the supportof Representative Jim Walsh (R-NY), Congress autho-rized the HRSA to develop newborn hearing screeningand follow-up services, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) to develop data and tracking sys-tems, and the NIDCD to support research in EHDI. By2005, every state had implemented a newborn hearing-screening program, and approximately 95% of newborninfants in the United States were screened for hearingloss before hospital discharge. Congress recommendedcooperation and collaboration among several federalagencies and advocacy organizations to facilitate andsupport the development of state EHDI systems. EHDI programs throughout the United States have demonstrated not only the feasibility of universal new-born hearing screening (UNHS) but also the benets ofearly identication and intervention. There is a growingbody of literature indicating that when identicationand intervention occur at no later than 6 months of agefor newborn infants who are deaf or hard of hearing, theinfants perform as much as 20 to 40 percentile pointshigher on school-related measures (vocabulary, articu-lation, intelligibility, social adjustment, and behav-ior). 10-13 Still, many important challenges remain. De- spite the fact that approximately 95% of newborninfants have their hearing screened in the United States,almost half of newborn infants who do not pass theinitial screening do not have appropriate follow-up toeither conrm the presence of a hearing loss and/orinitiate early intervention services (seewww.infanthearing.org, www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/ehdi, andwww.nidcd.nih.gov/health). State EHDI coordinators report system-wide problems including failure to communicate information to familiesin a culturally sensitive and understandable format at allstages of the EHDI process, lack of integrated state data-management and -tracking systems, and a shortage offacilities and personnel with the experience and exper-tise needed to provide follow-up for infants who arereferred from newborn screening programs. 14Available data indicate that a signicant number of children whoneed further assessment do not receive appropriate fol-low-up evaluations. However, the outlook is improvingas EHDI programs focus on the importance of strength-ening follow-up and intervention. PRINCIPLES All children with hearing loss should have access toresources necessary to reach their maximum potential.The following principles provide the foundation for ef-fective EHDI systems and have been updated and ex-panded since the 2000 JCIH position statement. 1. All infants should have access to hearing screening using a physiologic measure at no later than 1 month of age. 2. All infants who do not pass the initial hearing screen- ing and the subsequent rescreening should have ap-propriate audiological and medical evaluations to 900 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from conrm the presence of hearing loss at no later than 3 months of age. 3. All infants with conrmed permanent hearing loss should receive early intervention services as soon aspossible after diagnosis but at no later than 6 monthsof age. A simplied, single point of entry into anintervention system that is appropriate for childrenwith hearing loss is optimal. 4. The EHDI system should be family centered with infant and family rights and privacy guaranteedthrough informed choice, shared decision-making,and parental consent in accordance with state andfederal guidelines. Families should have access to in-formation about all intervention and treatment op-tions and counseling regarding hearing loss. 5. The child and family should have immediate access to high-quality technology including hearing aids, co-chlear implants, and other assistive devices when ap-propriate. 6. All infants and children should be monitored for hearing loss in the medical home. 15Continued assess- ment of communication development should be pro-vided by appropriate professionals to all children withor without risk indicators for hearing loss. 7. Appropriate interdisciplinary intervention programs for infants with hearing loss and their families shouldbe provided by professionals who are knowledgeableabout childhood hearing loss. Intervention programsshould recognize and build on strengths, informedchoices, traditions, and cultural beliefs of the families. 8. Information systems should be designed and imple- mented to interface with electronic health charts andshould be used to measure outcomes and report theeffectiveness of EHDI services at the patient, practice,community, state, and federal levels. GUIDELINES FOR EHDI PROGRAMSThe 2007 guidelines were developed to update the 2000JCIH position statement principles and to support thegoals of universal access to hearing screening, evalua-tion, and intervention for newborn and young infantsembodied in Healthy People 2010 . 9The guidelines provide current information on the development and implemen-tation of successful EHDI systems. Hearing screening should identify infants with specif- ically dened hearing loss on the basis of investigationsof long-term, developmental consequences of hearingloss in infants, currently available physiologic screeningtechniques, and availability of effective intervention inconcert with established principles of health screen-ing. 15-18Studies have demonstrated that current screen- ing technologies are effective in identifying hearing lossof moderate and greater degree. 19In addition, studies of children with permanent hearing loss indicate that mod-erate or greater degrees of hearing loss can have signif-icant effects on language, speech, academic, and social-emotional development. 20High-risk target populations also include infants in the NICU, because research datahave indicated that this population is at highest risk ofhaving neural hearing loss. 21-23 The JCIH, however, is committed to the goal of iden- tifying all degrees and types of hearing loss in childhoodand recognizes the developmental consequences of evenmild degrees of permanent hearing loss. Recent evi-dence, however, has suggested that current hearing-screening technologies fail to identify some infants withmild forms of hearing loss. 24,25In addition, depending on the screening technology selected, infants with hearingloss related to neural conduction disorders or \"auditoryneuropathy/auditory dyssynchrony\" may not be de-tected through a UNHS program. Although the JCIHrecognizes that these disorders may result in delayedcommunication, 26-28 currently recommended screening algorithms (ie, use of otoacoustic emission [OAE] testingalone) preclude universal screening for these disorders.Because these disorders typically occur in children whorequire NICU care, 21the JCIH recommends screening this group with the technology capable of detecting au-ditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony: automated ABR mea-surement. All infants, regardless of newborn hearing-screening outcome, should receive ongoing monitoring for devel-opment of age-appropriate auditory behaviors and com-munication skills. Any infant who demonstrates delayedauditory and/or communication skills development,even if he or she passed newborn hearing screening,should receive an audiological evaluation to rule outhearing loss. Roles and Responsibilities The success of EHDI programs depends on familiesworking in partnership with professionals as a well-coordinated team. The roles and responsibilities of eachteam member should be well dened and clearly under-stood. Essential team members are the birth hospital,families, pediatricians or primary health care profession-als (ie, the medical home), audiologists, otolaryngolo-gists, speech-language pathologists, educators of chil-dren who are deaf or hard of hearing, and other earlyintervention professionals involved in delivering EHDIservices. 29,30Additional services including genetics, oph- thalmology, developmental pediatrics, service coordina-tion, supportive family education, and counselingshould be available. 31 The birth hospital is a key member of the team. The birth hospital, in collaboration with the state EHDI co-ordinator, should ensure that parents and primaryhealth care professionals receive and understand thehearing-screening results, that parents are provided withappropriate follow-up and resource information, and PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 901 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from that each infant is linked to a medical home.2The hos- pital ensures that hearing-screening information is transmitted promptly to the medical home and appro-priate data are submitted to the state EHDI coordinator. The most important role for the family of an infant who is deaf or hard of hearing is to love, nurture, andcommunicate with the infant. From this foundation,families usually develop an urgent desire to understandand meet the special needs of their infant. Families gainknowledge, insight, and experience by accessing re-sources and through participation in scheduled earlyintervention appointments including audiological, med-ical, habilitative, and educational sessions. This experi-ence can be enhanced when families choose to becomeinvolved with parental support groups, people who aredeaf or hard of hearing, and/or their children's deaf orhard-of-hearing peers. Informed family choices and de-sired outcomes guide all decisions for these children. Avital function of the family's role is ensuring direct accessto communication in the home and the daily provisionof language-learning opportunities. Over time, the childbenets from the family's modeling of partnerships withprofessionals and advocating for their rights in all set-tings. The transfer of responsibilities from families to thechild develops gradually and increases as the child ma-tures, growing in independence and self-advocacy. Pediatricians, family physicians, and other allied health care professionals, working in partnership withparents and other professionals such as audiologists,therapists, and educators, constitute the infant's medicalhome. 2A medical home is dened as an approach to providing health care services with which care is acces-sible, family centered, continuous, comprehensive, co-ordinated, compassionate, and culturally competent.The primary health care professional acts in partnershipwith parents in a medical home to identify and accessappropriate audiology, intervention, and consultativeservices that are needed to develop a global plan ofappropriate and necessary health and habilitative carefor infants identied with hearing loss and infants withrisk factors for hearing loss. All children undergo sur-veillance for auditory skills and language milestones.The infant's pediatrician, family physician, or other pri-mary health care professional is in a position to advocatefor the child and family. 2,16 An audiologist is a person who, by virtue of academic degree, clinical training, and license to practice, is qual-ied to provide services related to the prevention ofhearing loss and the audiological diagnosis, identica-tion, assessment, and nonmedical and nonsurgical treat-ment of persons with impairment of auditory and ves-tibular function, and to the prevention of impairmentsassociated with them. Audiologists serve in a number ofroles. They provide newborn hearing-screening programdevelopment, management, quality assessment, servicecoordination and referral for audiological diagnosis, andaudiological treatment and management. For the fol-low-up component, audiologists provide comprehensiveaudiological diagnostic assessment to conrm the exis-tence of the hearing loss, ensure that parents understandthe signicance of the hearing loss, evaluate the infantfor candidacy for amplication and other sensory devicesand assistive technology, and ensure prompt referral toearly intervention programs. For the treatment andmanagement component, audiologists provide timelytting and monitoring of amplication devices. 32Other audiologists may provide diagnostic and auditory treat-ment and management services in the educational set-ting and provide a bridge between the child/family andthe audiologist in the clinic setting as well as otherservice providers. Audiologists also provide services asteachers, consultants, researchers, and administrators. Otolaryngologists are physicians whose specialty in- cludes determining the etiology of hearing loss; identi-fying related risk indicators for hearing loss, includingsyndromes that involve the head and neck; and evalu-ating and treating ear diseases. An otolaryngologist withknowledge of childhood hearing loss can determine ifmedical and/or surgical intervention may be appropri-ate. When medical and/or surgical intervention is pro-vided, the otolaryngologist is involved in the long-termmonitoring and follow-up with the infant's medicalhome. The otolaryngologist provides information andparticipates in the assessment of candidacy for ampli-cation, assistive devices, and surgical intervention, in-cluding reconstruction, bone-anchored hearing aids, andcochlear implantation. Early intervention professionals are trained in a vari- ety of academic disciplines such as speech-language pa-thology, audiology, education of children who are deafor hard of hearing, service coordination, or early child-hood special education. All individuals who provide ser-vices to infants with hearing loss should have specializedtraining and expertise in the development of audition,speech, and language. Speech-language pathologistsprovide both evaluation and intervention services forlanguage, speech, and cognitive-communication devel-opment. Educators of children who are deaf or hard ofhearing integrate the development of communicativecompetence within a variety of social, linguistic, andcognitive/academic contexts. Audiologists may providediagnostic and habilitative services family service plan (IFSP) or school-based individ-ualized education plan. To provide the highest quality ofintervention, more than 1 provider may be required. The care coordinator is an integral member of the EHDI team and facilitates the family's transition fromscreening to evaluation to early intervention. 33This per- son must be a professional (eg, social worker, teacher,nurse) who is knowledgeable about hearing loss. Thecare coordinator incorporates the family's preferencesfor outcomes into an IFSP as required by federal legisla- 902 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from tion. The care coordinator supports the family members in their choice of the infant's communicative develop-ment. Through the IFSP review, the infant's progress inlanguage, motor, cognitive, and social-emotional devel-opment is monitored. The care coordinator assists thefamily in advocating for the infant's unique develop-mental needs. The deaf and hard-of-hearing community includes members with direct experience with signed language,spoken language, hearing-aid and cochlear implant use,and other communication strategies and technologies.Optimally, adults who are deaf or hard-of-hearingshould play an integral part in the EHDI program. Bothadults and children in the deaf and hard-of-hearingcommunity can enrich the family's experience by serv-ing as mentors and role models. Such mentors haveexperience in negotiating their way in a hearing world,raising infants or children who are deaf or hard of hear-ing, and providing families with a full range of informa-tion about communication options, assistive technology,and resources that are available in the community. A successful EHDI program requires collaboration be- tween a variety of public and private institutions andagencies that assume responsibility for specic compo-nents (eg, screening, evaluation, intervention). Rolesand responsibilities may differ from state to state. Eachstate has dened a lead coordinating agency with over-sight responsibility. The lead coordinating agency ineach state should be responsible for identifying the pub-lic and private funding sources available to develop,implement, and coordinate EHDI systems. Hearing Screening Multidisciplinary teams of professionals, including audi-ologists, physicians, and nursing personnel, are neededto establish the UNHS component of EHDI programs. Allteam members work together to ensure that screeningprograms are of high quality and are successful. Anaudiologist should be involved in each component of thehearing-screening program, particularly at the level ofstatewide implementation and, whenever possible, atthe individual hospital level. Hospitals and agenciesshould also designate a physician to oversee the medicalaspects of the EHDI program. Each team of professionals responsible for the hospi- tal-based UNHS program should review the hospital in-frastructure in relationship to the screening program.Hospital-based programs should consider screeningtechnology (ie, OAE or automated validityof the specic screening device; screening protocols, in-cluding the timing of screening relative to nursery dis-charge; availability of qualied screening personnel;suitability of the acoustical and environments;follow-up referral criteria; referral pathways for follow-up; information management; and quality control andimprovement. Reporting and communication protocolsmust be well dened and include the content of reports to physicians and parents, documentation of results inmedical charts, and methods for reporting to state reg-istries and national data sets. Physiologic measures must be used to screen new- borns and infants for hearing loss. Such measures in-clude OAE and automated ABR testing. noninvasive re-cordings of physiologic activity underlying normal audi-tory function, both are easily performed in neonates andinfants, and both have been successfully used forUNHS. 19,34-37 However, there are important differences between the 2 measures. OAE measurements are ob-tained from the ear canal by using a sensitive micro-phone within a probe assembly that records cochlearresponses to acoustic stimuli. Thus, OAEs reflect thestatus of the peripheral auditory system extending to thecochlear outer hair cells. In contrast, ABR measurementsare obtained from surface electrodes that record neuralactivity generated in the cochlea, auditory nerve, andbrainstem in response to acoustic stimuli delivered viaan earphone. Automated ABR measurements reflect thestatus of the peripheral auditory system, the eighthnerve, and the brainstem auditory pathway. Both OAE and ABR screening technologies can be used to detect sensory (cochlear) hearing loss 19; how- ever, both technologies may be affected by outer ormiddle-ear dysfunction. Consequently, transient condi-tions of the outer and middle ear may result in a \"failed\"screening-test result in the presence of normal cochlearand/or neural function. 38Moreover, because OAEs are generated within the cochlea, OAE technology cannot be used to detect neural (eighth nerve or auditory brain-stem pathway) dysfunction. Thus, neural conductiondisorders or auditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony withoutconcomitant sensory dysfunction will not be detected byOAE testing. Some infants who pass newborn hearing screening will later demonstrate permanent hearing loss. 25Al- though this loss may reflect delayed-onset hearing loss,both ABR and OAE screening technologies will misssome hearing loss (eg, mild or isolated frequency regionlosses). Interpretive criteria for pass/fail outcomes should re- flect clear scientic rationale and should be evidencebased. 39,40Screening technologies that incorporate auto- mated-response detection are necessary to eliminate theneed for individual test interpretation, to reduce theeffects of screener bias or operator error on test outcome,and to ensure test consistency across infants, test condi-tions, and screening personnel. 41-45 When statistical probability is used to make pass/fail decisions, as is thecase for OAE and automated ABR screening devices, thelikelihood of obtaining a pass outcome by chance aloneis increased when screening is performed repeatedly. 46-48 PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 903 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from This principle must be incorporated into the policies of rescreening. There are no national standards for the calibration of OAE or ABR instrumentation. Compounding this prob-lem, there is a lack of uniform performance standards.Manufacturers of hearing-screening devices do not al-ways provide sufcient supporting evidence to validatethe specic pass/fail criteria and/or automated algo-rithms used in their instruments. 49In the absence of national standards, audiologists must obtain normativedata for the instruments and protocols they use. The JCIH recognizes that there are important issues differentiating screening performed in the well-infantnursery from that performed in the NICU. Although thegoals in each nursery are the same, numerous method-ologic and technological issues must be considered inprogram design and pass/fail criteria. Screening Protocols in the Well-Infant Nursery Many inpatient well-infant screening protocols provide1 hearing screening and, when necessary, a repeatscreening no later than at the time of discharge from thehospital, using the same technology both times. Use ofeither technology in the well-infant nursery will detectperipheral (conductive and sensory) hearing loss of 40dB or greater. 19When automated ABR is used as the single screening technology, neural auditory disorderscan also be detected. 50Some programs use a combina- tion of screening technologies (OAE testing for the initialscreening followed by automated ABR for rescreening[ie, 2-step protocol 5]) to decrease the fail rate at dis- charge and the subsequent need for outpatient follow-up. 34,35,37,51-53 With this approach, infants who do not pass an OAE screening but subsequently pass an automatedABR test are considered a screening \"pass.\" Infants in thewell-infant nursery who fail automated ABR testingshould not be rescreened by OAE testing and \"passed,\"because such infants are presumed to be at risk of havinga subsequent diagnosis of auditory neuropathy/dyssyn-chrony. Screening Protocols in the NICU An NICU is dened as a facility in which a neonatologistprovides primary care for the infant. Newborn units aredivided into 3 categories: Level I: basic care, well-infant nurseries Level II: specialty care by a neonatologist for infants atmoderate risk of serious complications Level III: a unit that provides both specialty and sub-specialty care including the provision of life support(mechanical ventilation) A total of 120 level-II NICUs and 760 level-III NICUs have been identied in the United States by survey, andinfants who have spent time in the NICU represent 10%to 15% of the newborn population. 54 The 2007 JCIH position statement includes neonates at risk of having neural hearing loss (auditory neuropa-thy/auditory dyssynchrony) in the target population tobe identied in the NICU, 55-57 because there is evidence that neural hearing loss results in adverse communica-tion outcomes. 22,50Consequently, the JCIH recommends ABR technology as the only appropriate screening tech-nique for use in the NICU. For infants who do not passautomated ABR testing in the NICU, referral should bemade directly to an audiologist for rescreening and,when indicated, comprehensive evaluation, includingdiagnostic ABR testing, rather than for general outpa-tient rescreening. Conveying Test Results Screening results should be conveyed immediately tofamilies so that they understand the outcome and theimportance of follow-up when indicated. To facilitatethis process for families, primary health care profession-als should work with EHDI team members to ensurethat: communications with parents are condential andpresented in a caring and sensitive manner, preferablyface-to-face; educational materials are developed and disseminatedto families that provide accurate information at anappropriate reading level and in a language they areable to comprehend; and parents are informed in a culturally sensitive and un-derstandable manner that their infant did not passscreening and informed about the importance ofprompt follow-up; before discharge, an appointmentshould be made for follow-up testing. To facilitate this process for primary care physicians, EHDI systems should ensure that medical professionalsreceive: the results of the screening test (pass, did not pass, ormissed) as documented in the hospital medical chart;and communication directly from a representative of thehospital screening program regarding each infant in itscare who did not pass or was missed and recommen-dations for follow-up. Outpatient Rescreening for Infants Who Do Not Pass theBirth Admission ScreeningMany well-infant screening protocols will incorporatean outpatient rescreening within 1 month of hospitaldischarge to minimize the number of infants referred forfollow-up audiological and medical evaluation. The out- 904 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from patient rescreening should include the testing of both ears, even if only 1 ear failed the inpatient screening. Outpatient screening at no later than 1 month of age should also be available to infants who were dischargedbefore receiving the birth admission screening or whowere born outside a hospital or birthing center. StateEHDI coordinators should be aware of some of the fol-lowing situations under which infants may be lost to theUNHS system: Home births and other out-of-hospital births: statesshould develop a mechanism to systematically offernewborn hearing screening for all out-of-hospitalbirths. Across-state-border births: states should develop writ-ten collaborative agreements sharing hearing-screening results and fol-low-up information. Hospital-missed screenings: when infants are dis-charged before the hearing screening is performed, amechanism should be in place for the hospital to con-tact the family and arrange for an outpatient hearingscreening. Transfers to in-state or out-of-state hospitals: dis-charge and transfer forms should contain the informa-tion of whether a hearing screening was performedand the results of any screening. The recipient hospitalshould complete a hearing screening if one was not previously performed or if there is a change in medicalstatus or a prolonged hospitalization. Readmissions: for readmissions in the rst month oflife when there are conditions associated with poten-tial hearing loss (eg, hyperbilirubinemia that requiresexchange transfusion or culture-positive sepsis), anABR screening should be performed before discharge. Additional mechanisms for states to share hearing- screening results and other medical information include(l) incorporating the hearing-screening results in a state-wide child health information system and (2) providingcombined metabolic screening and hearing-screening re-sults to the primary care physician. Conrmation of Hearing Loss in Infants Referred From UNHS Infants who meet the dened criteria for referral shouldreceive follow-up audiological and medical evaluationswith tting of amplication devices, as appropriate, at nolater than 3 months of age. Once hearing loss is con-rmed, coordination of services should be expedited bythe infant's medical home and Part C coordinating agen-cies for early intervention services, as authorized by theIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, followingthe EHDI algorithm developed by the AAP (Appendix 1).Audiological Evaluation Comprehensive audiological evaluation of newborn andyoung infants who fail newborn hearing screeningshould be performed by audiologists experienced in pe-diatric hearing assessment. The initial audiological testbattery to conrm a hearing loss in infants must includephysiologic measures and, when developmentally ap- propriate, behavioral methods. Conrmation of an in-fant's hearing status requires a test battery of audiologi-cal test procedures to assess the integrity of the auditorysystem in each ear, to estimate hearing sensitivity acrossthe speech frequency range, to determine the type ofhearing loss, to establish a baseline for further monitor-ing, and to provide information needed to initiate am-plication-device tting. A comprehensive assessmentshould be performed on both ears even if only 1 earfailed the screening test. Evaluation: Birth to 6 Months of Age For infants from birth to a developmental age of approx-imately 6 months, the test battery should include a childand family history, an evaluation of risk factors for con-genital hearing loss, and a parental report of the infant'sresponses to sound. The audiological assessment shouldinclude: Child and family history. A frequency-specic assessment of the ABR using air-conducted tone bursts and bone-conducted tonebursts when indicated. When permanent hearing lossis detected, frequency-specic ABR testing is neededto determine the degree and conguration of hear-ing loss in each ear for tting ABR indicators (auditory neu-ropathy/auditory dyssynchrony) such hyperbiliru-binemia or to determine if a cochlear micro-phonic is present. 28Furthermore, because some infants with neural hearing loss have no risk indica-tors, any infant who demonstrates \"no response\" onABR elicited by tone-burst stimuli must be evaluatedby a click-evoked ABR. 55 Distortion product or transient evoked OAEs. Tympanometry using a 1000-Hz probe tone. Clinician observation of infant's auditory behavioras a cross-check in conjunction with electrophysi-ologic measures. Behavioral observation alone is notadequate for determining whether hearing loss ispresent in this age group, and it is not adequate for thetting of amplication devices. PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 905 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Evaluation: 6 to 36 Months of Age For subsequent testing of infants and toddlers at devel-opmental ages of 6 to 36 months, the conrmatoryaudiological test battery includes: Child and family history. Parental report of auditory and visual behaviors andcommunication milestones. Behavioral audiometry (either visual reinforcement orconditioned-play audiometry, depending on thechild's developmental level), including pure-tone au-diometry across the frequency range for each ear andspeech-detection and -recognition measures. OAE testing. Acoustic immittance measures (tympanometry ABR testing if responses to behavioral audiometry arenot reliable or if ABR testing has not been performedin the past. Other Audiological Test ProceduresAt this time, there is insufcient evidence for use of theauditory steady-state response as the sole measure ofauditory status in newborn and infant populations. 58 Auditory steady-state response is a new evoked-poten-tial test that can accurately measure auditory sensitivitybeyond the limits of other test methods. It can determinefrequency-specic thresholds from 250 Hz to 8 kHz.Clinical research is being performed to investigate itspotential use in the standard pediatric diagnostic testbattery. Similarly, there are insufcient data for routineuse of acoustic middle-ear muscle reflexes in the initialdiagnostic assessment of infants younger than 4months. 59Both tests could be used to supplement the battery or could be included at older ages. Emergingtechnologies, such as broad-band reflectance, may beused to supplement conventional measures of middle-ear status (tympanometry and acoustic reflexes) as thetechnology becomes more widely available. 59 Medical EvaluationEvery infant with conrmed hearing loss and/or middle-ear dysfunction should be referred for otologic and othermedical evaluation. The purpose of these evaluations isto determine the etiology of hearing loss, to identifyrelated physical conditions, and to provide recommen-dations for medical/surgical treatment as well as referralfor other services. Essential components of the medicalevaluation include clinical history, family history ofchildhood-onset permanent hearing loss, identicationof syndromes associated with early- or late-onset per-manent hearing loss, a physical examination, and indi-cated radiologic and laboratory studies (including ge-netic testing). Portions of the medical evaluation, such asurine culture for CMV, a leading cause of hearing loss, might even begin in the birth hospital, particularly forinfants who spend time in the NICU. 60-62 Pediatrician/Primary Care PhysicianThe infant's pediatrician or other primary health careprofessional is responsible for monitoring the generalhealth, development, and well-being of the infant. Inaddition, the primary care physician must assume re-sponsibility to ensure that the audiological assessment isconducted on infants who do not pass screening andmust initiate referrals for medical specialty evaluationsnecessary to determine the etiology of the hearing loss.Middle-ear status should be monitored, because thepresence of middle-ear effusion can further compromisehearing. The primary care physician must partner withother specialists, including the otolaryngologist, to facil-itate coordinated care for the infant and family. Because30% to 40% of children with conrmed hearing loss willdemonstrate developmental delays or other disabilities,the primary care physician should closely monitor de-velopmental milestones and initiate referrals related to suspected disabilities. 63The medical home algorithm for management of infants with either suspected or provenpermanent hearing loss is provided in Appendix 1. 15 The pediatrician or primary care physician should review every infant's medical and family history for thepresence of risk indicators that require monitoring fordelayed-onset or progressive hearing loss and shouldensure that an audiological evaluation is completed forchildren at risk of hearing loss at least once by 24 to 30months of age, regardless of their newborn screeningresults. 25Infants with specic risk factors, such as those who received ECMO therapy and those with CMV in-fection, are at increased risk of delayed-onset or progres-sive hearing loss 64-67and should be monitored closely. In addition, the primary care physician is responsible forongoing surveillance of parent concerns about languageand hearing, auditory skills, and developmental mile-stones of all infants and children regardless of risk status,as outlined in the pediatric periodicity schedule pub-lished by the AAP. 16 Children with cochlear implants may be at increased risk of acquiring bacterial meningitis compared withchildren in the general US population. 68The CDC recommends that all children with, and all potentialrecipients of, cochlear implants follow specic recom-mendations for pneumococcal immunization that ap-ply cochlear implant that they receiveage-appropriate Haemophilus influenzae type b vac- cines. Recommendations for the timing and type ofpneumococcal vaccine vary with age and immuniza-tion history and should be discussed with a health careprofessional. 69 906 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Otolaryngologist Otolaryngologists are physicians and surgeons who di-agnose, treat, and manage a wide range of diseases of thehead and neck and specialize in treating hearing andvestibular disorders. They perform a full medical diag-nostic evaluation of the head and neck, ears, and relatedstructures, including a comprehensive history and phys-ical examination, leading to a medical diagnosis andappropriate medical and surgical management. Often, ahearing or balance disorder is an indicator of, or relatedto, a medically treatable condition or an underlying sys-temic disease. Otolaryngologists work closely with otherdedicated professionals, including physicians, audiolo-gists, speech-language pathologists, educators, and oth-ers, in caring for patients with hearing, balance, voice,speech, developmental, and related disorders. The otolaryngologist's evaluation includes a compre- hensive history to identify the presence of risk factors forearly-onset childhood permanent hearing loss, such asfamily history of hearing loss, having been admitted tothe NICU for more than 5 days, and having receivedECMO (see Appendix 2). 70,71 A complete head and neck examination for craniofa- cial anomalies should document defects of the auricles,patency of the external ear canals, and status of theeardrum and middle-ear structures. Atypical ndings oneye examination, including irises of 2 different colors orabnormal positioning of the eyes, may signal a syndromethat includes hearing loss. Congenital permanent con-ductive hearing loss may be associated with craniofacialanomalies that are seen in disorders such as Crouzon disease, Klippel-Feil syndrome, and Goldenhar syn-drome. 72The assessment of infants with these congenital anomalies should be coordinated with a clinical geneti-cist. In large population studies, at least 50% of congenital hearing loss has been designated as hereditary, andnearly 600 syndromes and 125 genes associated withhearing loss have already been identied. 72,73The eval- uation, therefore, should include a review of familyhistory of specic genetic disorders or syndromes, in-cluding genetic testing for gene mutations such as 2). As the widespread use of newly developed conjugate vaccines decreases the prevalenceof infectious etiologies such as measles, and childhood meningitis, centage of each successive cohort of early-onset hearingloss attributable to genetic etiologies can be expected toincrease, prompting recommendations for early geneticevaluations. Approximately 30% to 40% of childrenwith hearing loss have associated disabilities, which canbe of importance in patient management. The decisionto obtain genetic testing depends on informed familychoice in conjunction with standard condentiality guidelines. 77 In the absence of a genetic or established medical cause, a computed tomography scan of the temporalbones may be performed to identify cochlear abnormal-ities, such as Mondini deformity with an enlarged ves-tibular aqueduct, which have been associated with pro-gressive hearing loss. Temporal bone imaging studiesmay also be used to assess potential candidacy for sur-gical intervention, including reconstruction, bone-an-chored hearing aid, and cochlear implantation. Recentdata have shown that some children with electrophysi-ologic evidence suggesting auditory neuropathy/dyssyn-chrony may have an absent or abnormal cochlear nervethat may be detected with MRI. 78 Historically, an extensive battery of laboratory and radiographic studies was routinely recommended fornewborn infants and children with newly diagnosedsensorineural hearing loss. However, emerging technol-ogies for the diagnosis of genetic and infectious disordershave simplied the search for a denitive diagnosis,which obviates the need for costly diagnostic evaluationsin some instances. 70,71,79 If, after an initial evaluation, the etiology remains uncertain, an expanded multidisciplinary evaluationprotocol including electrocardiography, The etiology of neonatal hearing loss, however,may remain uncertain in as many as 30% to 40% ofchildren. Once hearing loss is conrmed, medical clear-ance for hearing aids and initiation of early interventionshould not be delayed while this diagnostic evaluation isin process. Careful longitudinal monitoring to detect andpromptly treat coexisting middle-ear effusions is an es-sential component of ongoing otologic management ofthese children. Other Medical Specialists The medical geneticist is responsible for the interpreta-tion of family history data, the clinical evaluation anddiagnosis of inherited disorders, the performance andassessment of genetic tests, and the provision of geneticcounseling. Geneticists or genetic counselors are quali-ed to interpret the signicance and limitations of newtests and to convey the current status of knowledgeduring genetic counseling. All families of children withconrmed hearing loss should be offered, and may ben-et from, a genetics evaluation and counseling. Thisevaluation can provide families with information onetiology of hearing loss, prognosis for progression, asso-ciated disorders (eg, renal, vision, cardiac), and likeli-hood of recurrence in future offspring. This informationmay influence parents' decision-making regarding inter-vention options for their child. Every infant with a conrmed hearing loss should have an evaluation by an ophthalmologist to document PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 907 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from visual acuity and rule out concomitant or late-onset vision disorders such as Usher syndrome.1,80Indicated referrals to other medical subspecialists, including devel-opmental pediatricians, neurologists, cardiologists, andnephrologists, should be facilitated and coordinated bythe primary health care professional. Early Intervention Before newborn hearing screening was instituted uni-versally, children with severe-to-profound hearing loss,on average, completed the 12th grade with a 3rd- to4th-grade reading level and language levels of a 9- to10-year-old hearing child. 81In contrast, infants and chil- dren with mild-to-profound hearing loss who are iden-tied in the rst 6 months of life and provided withimmediate and appropriate intervention have signi-cantly better outcomes than later-identied infants andchildren in vocabulary produc- tion,13,86-88 and social-emotional development.89Children enrolled in early intervention within the rst year of lifehave also been shown to have language developmentwithin the normal range of development at 5 years ofage. 31,90 Therefore, according to federal guidelines, once any degree of hearing loss is diagnosed in a child, a referralshould be initiated to an early intervention programwithin 2 days of conrmation of hearing loss (CFR303.321d). The initiation of early intervention servicesshould begin as soon as possible after diagnosis of hear-ing loss but at no later than 6 months of age. Even whenthe hearing status is not determined to be the primarydisability, the family and child should have access tointervention with a provider who is knowledgeableabout hearing loss. 91 UNHS programs have been instituted throughout the United States for the purpose of preventing the signi-cant and negative effects of hearing loss on the cognitive,language, speech, auditory, social-emotional, and aca-demic development of infants and children. To achievethis goal, hearing loss must be identied as quickly aspossible after birth, and appropriate early interventionmust be available to all families and infants with perma-nent hearing loss. Some programs have demonstratedthat most children with hearing loss and no additionaldisabilities can achieve and maintain language develop-ment within the typical range of children who havenormal hearing. 12,13,85,90 Because these studies were de- scriptive and not causal studies, the efcacy of speciccomponents of intervention cannot be separated fromthe total provision of comprehensive services. Thus, thefamily-centered philosophy, the intensity of services, theexperience and training of the provider, the method ofcommunication, the curricula, the counseling proce-dures, the parent support and advocacy, and the deafand hard-of-hearing support and advocacy are all vari-ables with unknown effects on the overall outcomes of any individual child. The key component of providingquality services is the expertise of the provider specic tohearing loss. These services may be provided in thehome, a center, or a combination of the 2 locations. The term \"intervention services\" is used to describe any type of habilitative, rehabilitative, or educationalprogram provided to children with hearing loss. In somecases of mild hearing losses, amplication technologymay be the only service provided. Some parents chooseonly developmental assessment or occasional consulta-tion, such as parents with infants who have unilateralhearing losses. Children with high-frequency losses andnormal hearing in the low frequencies may only be seenby a speech-language pathologist, and those with signif-icant bilateral sensorineural hearing losses might be seenby an educator of the deaf and receive additional ser-vices. Principles of Early Intervention To ensure informed decision-making, parents of infantswith newly diagnosed hearing loss should be offeredopportunities to interact with other families who haveinfants or children with hearing loss as well as adults andchildren who are deaf or hard of hearing. In addition,parents should also be offered access to professional,educational, and consumer organizations and providedwith general information on child development, lan-guage development, and hearing loss. A number of prin-ciples and guidelines have been developed that offer aframework for quality early intervention service deliverysystems for children who are deaf or hard of hearing andtheir families. 92Foundational characteristics of develop- ing and implementing early intervention programs in-clude a family-centered approach, culturally responsivepractices, collaborative professional-family relationshipsand involvement, developmentally appro-priate practice, interdisciplinary assessment, and com-munity-based provision of services. Designated Point of Entry States should develop a single point of entry into inter-vention specic for hearing impairment to ensure that,regardless of geographic location, all families who haveinfants or children with hearing loss receive informationabout a full range of options regarding amplication andtechnology, communication and intervention, and ac-cessing appropriate counseling services. This state sys-tem, if separate from the state's Part C system, shouldintegrate and partner with the state's Part C program.Parental consent must be obtained according to state andfederal requirements to share the IFSP information withproviders and transmit data to the state EHDI coordina-tor. 908 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Regular Developmental Assessment To ensure accountability, individual, community, andstate health and educational programs should assumethe responsibility for coordinated, ongoing measure-ment and improvement of EHDI process outcomes. Earlyintervention programs must assess the language, cogni-tive skills, auditory skills, speech, vocabulary, and social-emotional development of all children with hearing lossat 6-month intervals during the rst 3 years of life byusing assessment tools that have been standardized onchildren with normal hearing and norm-referenced as-sessment tools that are appropriate to measure progressin verbal and visual language. The primary purpose of regular developmental mon- itoring is to provide valuable information to parentsabout the rate of their child's development as well asprogrammatic feedback concerning curriculum deci-sions. Families also become knowledgeable about expec-tations and milestones of typical development of hearingchildren. Studies have shown that valid and reliabledocumentation of developmental progress is possiblethrough parent questionnaires, analysis of videotapedconversational interactions, and clinically administeredassessments.* Documentation of developmental progressshould be provided on a regular basis to parents and,with parental release of information, to the medicalhome and audiologist. Although criterion-referencedchecklists may provide valuable information for estab-lishing intervention strategies and goals, these assess-ment tools alone are not sufcient for parents and in-tervention professionals to determine if a child'sdevelopmental progress is comparable with his or herhearing peers. Opportunities for Interaction With Other Parents of Children With Hearing LossIntervention professionals should seek to involve par-ents at every level of the EHDI process and develop trueand meaningful partnerships with parents. To reflect thevalue of the contributions that selected parents make todevelopment and program components, these parentsshould be paid as contributing staff members. Parentrepresentatives should be included in all advisory boardactivities. In many states, parents have been integral andoften have taken leadership roles in the development ofpolicy, resource material, communication mechanisms,mentoring and advocacy opportunities, dissemination ofinformation, and interaction with the deaf communityand other individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.Parents, often in partnership with people who are deafand hard of hearing, have also participated in the train-ing of professionals. They should be participants in theregular assessment of program services to ensure ongo-ing improvement and quality assurance.Opportunities for Interaction With Individuals Who Are Deafor Hard of HearingIntervention programs should include opportunities forinvolvement of individuals who are deaf or hard ofhearing in all aspects of EHDI programs. Because inter-vention programs serve children with mild-to-profound,unilateral or bilateral, permanent conductive, and sen-sory or neural hearing disorders, role models who aredeaf or hard of hearing can be signicant assets to anintervention program. These individuals can serve onstate EHDI advisory boards and be trained as mentors forfamilies and children with hearing loss who choose toseek their support. Almost all families choose at sometime during their early childhood programs to seek outboth adults and child peers with hearing loss. Programsshould ensure that these opportunities are available andcan be delivered to families through a variety of com-munications means, such as Web sites, e-mail, newslet-ters, videos, retreats, picnics and other social events, andeducational forums for parents. Provision of Communication Options Research studies thus far of early-identied infants withhearing loss have not found signicant differences in thedevelopmental outcomes by method of communicationwhen measured at 3 years of age. Therefore, a range ofoptions should be offered to families in a nonbiasedmanner. In addition, there have been reports of childrenwith successful outcomes for each of the different meth-ods of communication. The choice is a dynamic processon a continuum, differs according to the individualneeds of each family, and can be adjusted as necessaryon the basis of a child's rate of progress in developingcommunication skills. Programs need to provide familieswith access to skilled and experienced early interventionprofessionals to facilitate communication and languagedevelopment in the communication option chosen bythe family. Skills of the Early Intervention Professional All studies with successful outcomes reported for early-identied children who are deaf or hard of hearing haveintervention provided by specialists who are trained inparent-infant intervention services. 12,90,97 Early interven- tion programs should develop mechanisms to ensurethat early intervention professionals have special skillsnecessary for providing families with the highest qualityof service specic to children with hearing loss. Profes-sionals with a background in deaf education, audiology,and speech-language pathology will typically have theskills needed for providing intervention services. Profes-sionals should be highly qualied in their respectiveelds and should be skilled communicators who areknowledgeable and sensitive to the importance of en- *Refs 10 -13, 51, 85, 87-90, and 93-96.

PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 909 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from hancing families' strengths and supporting their priori- ties. When early intervention professionals have knowl-edge of the principles of adult learning, it increases theirsuccess with parents and other professionals. Quality of Intervention Services Children with conrmed hearing loss and their familieshave the right to prompt access to quality interventionservices. For newborn infants with conrmed hearingloss, enrollment into intervention services should beginas soon after hearing-loss conrmation as possible andno later than 6 months of age. Successful early interven-tion programs (1) are family centered, (2) provide fam-ilies with unbiased information on all options regardingapproaches to communication, (3) monitor develop-ment at 6-month intervals with norm-referenced instru-ments, (4) include individuals who are deaf or hard ofhearing, (5) provide services in a natural environment inthe home or in the center, (6) offer high-quality serviceregardless of where the family lives, (7) obtain informedconsent, (8) are sensitive to cultural and language dif-ferences and provide accommodations as needed, and(9) conduct annual surveys of parent satisfaction. Intervention for Special Populations of Infants and Young ChildrenDevelopmental monitoring should also occur at regular6-month intervals for special populations of childrenwith hearing loss, including those with minimal andmild bilateral hearing loss, 98unilateral hearing loss,99,100 and neural hearing loss,22because these children are at risk of having speech and language delay. Research nd-ings indicate that approximately one third of childrenwith permanent unilateral loss experience signicantlanguage and academic delays. 99-101 Audiological HabilitationMost infants and children with bilateral hearing loss andmany with unilateral hearing loss benet from someform of personal amplication device. 32If the family chooses personal amplication for its infant, hearing-aidselection and tting should occur within 1 month ofinitial conrmation of hearing loss even when additionalaudiological assessment is ongoing. Audiological habili-tation services should be provided by an audiologist whois experienced with these procedures. Delay betweenconrmation of the hearing loss and tting of an ampli-cation device should be minimized. 51,102 Hearing-aid proceeds OAE, and tympanometry and medicalexamination are in accord. For infants who are below adevelopmental age of 6 months, hearing-aid selectionwill be based on physiologic measures alone. Behavioralthreshold assessment with visual reinforcement audiom-etry should be obtained as soon as possible to cross-check and augment physiologic ndings (see www.au-diology.org). The goal of amplication-device tting is to provide the infant with maximum access to all of the acousticfeatures of speech within an intensity range that is safeand comfortable. That is, amplied speech should becomfortably above the infant's sensory threshold butbelow the level of discomfort across the speech fre-quency range for both ears. To accomplish this in in-fants, amplication-device selection, tting, and veri-cation should be based on a prescriptive procedure thatincorporates individual real-ear measures that accountfor each infant's ear-canal acoustics 32 Validation of the benets of amplication, particularlyfor speech perception, should be examined in the clinicalsetting as well as in the child's typical listening environ-ments. Complementary or alternative technology, suchas frequency modulation (FM) systems or cochlear im-plants, may be recommended as the primary and/orsecondary listening device depending on the degree ofthe infant's hearing loss, the goals of auditory habilita-tion, the infant's acoustic environments, and the fami-ly's informed choices. 3Monitoring of amplication, as well as the long-term validation of the appropriatenessof the individual habilitation program, requires ongoingaudiological assessment along with electroacoustic, real-ear, and functional checks of the hearing instruments.As the hearing loss becomes more specically denedthrough audiological assessments and as the child's with growth, renement of theindividual prescriptive hearing-aid gain and output tar-gets is necessary. Monitoring also includes periodic val-idation of communication, social-emotional, and cogni-tive development and, later, academic performance toensure that progress is commensurate with the child'sabilities. It is possible that infants and young childrenwith measurable residual \"hearing\" (auditory responses)and well-t amplication devices may fail to developauditory skills necessary for successful spoken commu-nication. Ongoing validation of the amplication deviceis accomplished through interdisciplinary evaluation andcollaboration with the early intervention team and fam-ily. Cochlear implantation should be given careful con- sideration for any child who seems to receive limitedbenet from a trial with appropriately tted hearingaids. According to US Food and Drug Administrationguidelines, infants with profound bilateral hearing lossare candidates for cochlear implantation at 12 months ofage and children with bilateral severe hearing loss areeligible at 24 months of age. The presence of develop-mental conditions (eg, developmental delay, autism) inaddition to hearing loss should not, as a rule, precludethe consideration of cochlear implantation for an infantor child who is deaf. Benets from hearing aids andcochlear implants in children with neural hearing loss 910 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from have also been documented. The benet of acoustic amplication for children with neural hearing loss isvariable. 28,103 Thus, a trial tting is indicated for infants with neural hearing loss until the usefulness of the t-ting can be determined. Neural hearing loss is a hetero-geneous condition; the decision to continue or discon-tinue use of hearing aids should be made on the basisof the benet derived from amplication. Use of co-chlear implants in neural hearing loss is growing, andpositive outcomes have been reported for many chil-dren. 28 Infants and young children with unilateral hearing loss should also be assessed for appropriateness of hear-ing-aid tting. Depending on the degree of residualhearing in unilateral loss, a hearing aid may or may notbe indicated. Use of \"contralateral routing of signals\"amplication for unilateral hearing loss in children is notrecommended. 104Research is currently underway to de- termine how to best manage unilateral hearing loss ininfants and young children. The effect of otitis media with effusion (OME) is greater for infants with sensorineural hearing loss thanfor those with normal cochlear function. 73Sensory or permanent conductive hearing loss is compounded byadditional transient conductive hearing loss associatedwith OME. OME further reduces access to auditory cuesnecessary for the development of spoken English. OMEalso negatively affects the prescriptive targets of thehearing-aid tting, decreasing auditory awareness andrequiring adjustment of the amplication characteristics.Prompt referral to either the primary care physician oran otolaryngologist for treatment of persistent OME isindicated in infants with sensorineural hearing loss. 105 Denitive resolution of OME should never delay thetting of an amplication device. 73,106 Medical and Surgical InterventionMedical intervention is the process by which a physicianprovides medical diagnosis and direction for medicaland/or surgical treatment options for hearing loss and/orrelated medical disorder(s) associated with hearing loss.Treatment varies from the removal of cerumen and thetreatment of OME to long-term plans for reconstructivesurgery and assessment of candidacy for cochlear im-plants. If necessary, surgical treatment of malformationof the outer and middle ears, including bone-anchoredhearing aids, should be considered in the interventionplan for infants with permanent conductive or mixedhearing loss when they reach an appropriate age. Communication Assessment and Intervention Language is acquired with greater ease during certain sen-sitive periods of infant and toddler development. 107-109 The process of language acquisition includes learning theprecursors of language, such as the rules that pertain toselective attention and turn taking. 20,110,111 Cognitive, so-cial, and emotional development are influenced by theacquisition of language. Development in these areas issynergistic. A complete language evaluation should beperformed at regular intervals for infants and toddlerswith hearing loss. The evaluation should include anassessment of oral, manual, and/or visual mechanisms aswell as cognitive abilities. A primary focus of language intervention is to support families in fostering the communication abilities of theirinfants and toddlers who are deaf or hard of hearing. 20 Spoken- and/or sign-language development should becommensurate with the child's age and cognitive abili-ties and should include acquisition of (forspoken signed depending on the family's preferred mode of com-munication. Early intervention professionals should follow family- centered principles to assist in developing communica-tive competence of infants and toddlers who are deaf orhard of hearing. 112-114 Families should be provided with information specic to language development and accessto peer and language models as well as family-involvedactivities that facilitate language development of chil-dren with normal hearing and children who are hard ofhearing or deaf. 115,116 Depending on family choices, fam- ilies should be offered access to children and adults withhearing loss who are appropriate and competent lan-guage models. Information on spoken language andsigned language, such as American Sign Language 117and cued speech, should be provided. Continued Surveillance, Screening, and Referral of Infants and ToddlersAppendix 2 presents 11 risk indicators that are associ-ated with either congenital or delayed-onset hearingloss. A single list of risk indicators is presented in thecurrent JCIH statement, because there is signicantoverlap among those indicators associated with congen-ital/neonatal hearing loss and those associated with de-layed-onset/acquired or progressive hearing loss.Heightened surveillance of all infants with risk indica-tors, therefore, is recommended. There is a signicantchange in the denition of risk-indicator 3, which hasbeen modied from NICU stay more than 48 hours toNICU stay more than 5 days. Consistent with 2000 JCIHposition statement, 3the 2007 position statement recom- mends use of risk indicators for hearing loss for 3 pur-poses. Historically, the rst use of risk indicators is forthe identication of infants who should receive audio-logical evaluation but who live in geographic locations(eg, developing nations, remote areas) where universalhearing screening is not yet available. This use hasbecome less common as a result of the expansion of Refs 3, 19, 21, 24, 25, 64, and 118 -124. PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 911 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from UNHS. The second purpose of risk-indicator identica- tion is to help identify infants who pass the neonatalscreening but are at risk of developing delayed-onsethearing loss and, therefore, should receive ongoing med-ical, speech and language, and audiological surveillance.Third, the risk indicators are used to identify infants whomay have passed neonatal screening but have mildforms of permanent hearing loss. 25 Because some important indicators, such as family history of hearing loss, may not be determined duringthe course of UNHS, 14,72the presence of all risk indicators for acquired hearing loss should be determined in themedical home during early well-infant visits. Risk indi-cators that are marked with a section symbol in Appen-dix 2 are of greater concern for delayed-onset hearingloss. Early and more frequent assessment may be indi-cated for children with CMV infection, 118,125,126 syn- positive postnatal infections associated with sensorineu-ral hearing loss 130,131 ; for children who have received ECMO64or chemotherapy132; and when there is care- giver concern or a family history of hearing loss.16 For all infants with and without risk indicators for hearing loss, developmental milestones, hearing skills,and parent concerns about hearing, speech, and lan-guage skills should be monitored during routine medicalcare consistent with the AAP periodicity schedule. The JCIH has determined that the previously recom- mended approach to follow-up of infants with risk indi-cators for hearing loss only addressed children withidentiable risk indicators and failed to consider thepossibility of delayed-onset hearing loss in childrenwithout identiable risk indicators. In addition, concernswere raised about feasibility and cost associated with the2000 JCIH recommendation for audiological monitoringof all infants with risk indicators at 6-month intervals.Because approximately 400 000 infants are cared forannually in NICUs in the United States, and the 2000JCIH recommendation included audiology assessmentsat 6-month intervals from 6 months to 36 months of agefor all infants admitted to an NICU for more than 48hours, an unreasonable burden was placed on both pro-viders of audiology services and families. In addition,there was no provision for identication of delayed-onset hearing loss in infants without an identiable riskindicator. Data from 2005 for 12 388 infants dischargedfrom NICUs in the National Perinatal Information Net-work indicated that 52% of infants were dischargedwithin the rst 5 days of life, and these infants weresignicantly less likely to have an identied risk indica-tor for hearing loss other than NICU stay. Therefore, the2007 JCIH recommends an alternative, more inclusivestrategy of surveillance of all children within the medicalhome based on the pediatric periodicity schedule. Thisprotocol will permit the detection of children with eithermissed neonatal or delayed-onset hearing loss irrespec-tive of the presence or absence of a high-risk indicator. The JCIH recognizes that an optimal surveillance and screening program within the medical home would in-clude the following: At each visit, consistent with the AAP periodicityschedule, infants should be monitored for auditoryskills, middle-ear status, and developmental mile-stones (surveillance). Concerns elicited during surveil-lance should be followed by administration of a vali-dated global screening tool. 133A validated global screening tool is administered to all infants at 9, 18,and 24 to 30 months or, if there is physician or pa-rental concern about hearing or language, sooner. 133 If an infant does not pass the speech-language portionof the global screening in the medical home or if thereis physician or caregiver concern about hearing orspoken-language development, the child should bereferred immediately for further evaluation by an au-diologist and a speech-language pathologist for aspeech and language evaluation with validatedtools. 133 Once hearing loss is diagnosed in an infant, siblingswho are at increased risk of having hearing loss shouldbe referred for audiological evaluation. 14,75,134,135 All infants with a risk indicator for hearing loss (Ap-pendix 2), regardless of surveillance ndings, shouldbe referred for an audiological assessment at least onceby 24 to 30 months of age. Children with risk indica-tors that are highly associated with delayed-onsethearing loss, such as having received ECMO or havingCMV infection, should have more frequent audiologi-cal assessments. All infants for whom the family has signicant con-cerns regarding hearing or communication should bepromptly referred for an audiological and speech-lan-guage assessment. A careful assessment of middle-ear status (using pneu-matic otoscopy and/or tympanometry) should well-child visits, and children withpersistent middle-ear effusion that last for 3 months orlonger should be referred for otologic evaluation. 136 Protecting the Rights of Infants and FamiliesEach agency or institution involved in the EHDI processshares responsibility for protecting infant and familyrights in all aspects of UNHS, including access to infor-mation including potential benets and risks in the fam-ily's native language, input into decision-making, andcondentiality. 77Families should receive information about childhood hearing loss in easily understood lan-guage. Families have the right to accept or decline hear-ing screening or any follow-up care for their newborn 912 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from infant within the statutory regulations, just as they have for any other screening or evaluation procedures orintervention. EHDI data merit the same level of condentiality and security afforded all other health care and educationinformation in practice and law. The infant's family hasthe right to condentiality of the screening and fol-low-up assessments and the acceptance or rejection ofsuggested intervention(s). In compliance with federaland state laws, mechanisms should be established thatensure parental release and approval of all communica-tions regarding the infant's test results, including thoseto the infant's medical home and early intervention-coordinating agency and programs. The Health Insur-ance Portability and Accountability Act (Pub L No. 104-191 [1996]) regulations permit the sharing of healthinformation among health care professionals. Information Infrastructure In its 2000 position statement, 3the JCIH recommended development of uniform state registries and nationalinformation databases that incorporate standardizedmethodology, reporting, and system evaluation. EHDIinformation systems are to provide for the ongoing andsystematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of datain the process of measuring and reporting associatedprogram services (eg, screening, evaluation, diagnosis,and/or intervention). These systems are used to guideactivities, planning, implementation, and evaluation ofprograms and to formulate research hypotheses. EHDI information systems are generally authorized by legislators and implemented by public health ofcials.These systems vary from a simple system that collectsdata from a single source to electronic systems that re-ceive data from many sources in multiple formats. Thenumber and variety of systems will likely increase withadvances in electronic data interchange and integrationof data, which will also heighten the importance ofpatient privacy, data condentiality, and system secu-rity. The appropriate agencies and/or ofcials should beconsulted for any projects regarding public health sur-veillance. 69 Federal and state agencies are collaborating in the standardization of data denitions to ensure the value ofdata sets and to prevent misleading or unreliable infor-mation. Information management is used to improveservices to infants and their families; to assess the quan-tity and timeliness of screening, evaluation, and enroll-ment into intervention; and to facilitate collection ofdemographic data on neonatal and infant hearing loss. The JCIH endorses the concept of a limited national database to permit documentation of the demographicsof neonatal hearing loss, including prevalence and etiol-ogy across the United States. The information obtainedfrom the information-management system should assistboth the primary health care professional and the statehealth agency in measuring quality indicators associated with program services (eg, screening, diagnosis, and in-tervention). The information system should providemeasurement tools to determine the degree to whicheach process is stable and sustainable and conforms toprogram benchmarks. Timely and accurate monitoringof relevant quality measures is essential. Since 1999, the CDC and the Directors of Speech and Hearing Programs in State Health and Welfare Agencies(DSHPSHWA) have collected annual aggregate EHDIprogram data needed to address the national EHDI goals.In 1999, a total of 22 states provided data for the DSHP-SHWA survey. Participation had increased to 48 states, 1territory, and the District of Columbia in 2003. However,many programs have been unable to respond to all thequestions on the survey because of lack of a statewidecomprehensive data-management and reporting system. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (Pub L No. 103-62) requires that federalprograms establish measurable goals approved by the USOfce of Management and Budget (OMB) that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linkingfuture funding decisions with performance. The HRSAhas modied its reporting requirements for all grantprograms. The GPRA measures that must be reported tothe OMB by the MCHB annually for the EHDI programare: the number of infants screened for hearing loss beforedischarge from the hospital; the number of infants with conrmed hearing loss atno later than 3 months of age; the number of infants enrolled in a program of earlyintervention at no later than 6 months of age; the number of infants with conrmed or suspectedhearing loss referred to an ongoing source of compre-hensive health care (ie, medical home); and the number of children with nonsyndromic hearingloss who have developmentally appropriate languageand communication skills at school entry. One GPRA measure that must be reported to the OMB by the CDC annually for the EHDI program is thepercentage of newborn infants with a positive screeningresult for hearing loss who are subsequently lost tofollow-up. EHDI programs have made tremendous gains in their ability to collect, analyze, and interpret data in the pro-cess of measuring and reporting associated program ser-vices. However, only a limited number of EHDI pro-grams are currently able to accurately report the numberof infants screened, evaluated, and enrolled in interven-tion, the age of time-related objectives (eg, screening by1 month of age), and the severity or laterality of hearingloss. This is complicated by the lack of data standards and PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 913 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from by privacy issues within the regulations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub L No.93-380). Given the current lack of standardized and readily accessible sources of data, the CDC EHDI program, incollaboration with the DSHPSHWA, developed a revisedsurvey to obtain annual EHDI data from states and ter-ritories in a consistent manner to assess progress towardmeeting the national EHDI goals and the Healthy People 2010 objectives. In October 2006, the OMB, which is responsible for reviewing all government surveys, ap-proved the new EHDI hearing screening and follow-upsurvey. To facilitate this effort, the CDC EHDI Data Com-mittee is establishing the minimum data elements anddenitions needed for information systems to be used toassess progress toward the national EHDI goals. The JCIH encourages the CDC and HRSA to continue their efforts to identify barriers and explore possiblesolutions with EHDI programs to ensure that children ineach state who seek hearing-related services in statesother than where they reside receive all recommendedscreening and follow-up services. EHDI systems shouldalso be designed to promote the sharing of data regard-ing early hearing loss through integration and/or linkagewith other child health information systems. The CDCcurrently provides funds to integrate the EHDI systemwith other state/territorial screening, tracking, and sur-veillance programs that identify children with specialhealth care needs. Grantees of the MCHB are encour-aged to link hearing-screening data with such childhealth data sets as electronic birth certicates, vital sta-tistics, birth defects registries, metabolic or newborndried \"blood-spot\" screenings, immunization registries,and others. To promote the best use of public health resources, EHDI information systems should be evaluated periodi-cally, and such evaluations should include recommen-dations for improving quality, efciency, and usefulness.The appropriate evaluation of public health surveillancesystems becomes paramount as these systems adapt torevise case denitions, address new health-relatedevents, adopt new information technology, ensure datacondentiality, and assess system security. 69 Currently, federal sources of systems support include Title V block grants to states for maternal and childhealth care services, Title XIX (Medicaid) federal andstate funds for eligible children, and competitive USDepartment of Education personnel preparation and re-search grants. The NIDCD provides grants for researchrelated to early identication and intervention for chil-dren who are deaf or hard of hearing. 137 Universities should assume responsibility for special- track, interdisciplinary, professional education programsfor early intervention for infants and children with hear-ing loss. Universities should also provide training in fam-ily systems, the grieving process, cultural diversity, au-ditory skill development, and deaf culture. There is acritical need for in-service and preservice training ofprofessionals related to EHDI programs, which is partic-ularly acute for audiologists and early interventionistswith expertise in hearing loss. This training will requireincreased and sustained funding for personnel prepara-tion. Benchmarks and Quality Indicators The JCIH supports the concept of regular measurementsof performance and recommends routine monitoring ofthese measures for interprogram comparison and con-tinuous quality improvement. Performance benchmarksrepresent a consensus of expert opinion in the eld ofnewborn hearing screening and intervention. Thebenchmarks are the minimal requirements that shouldbe attained by high-quality EHDI programs. Frequentmeasures of quality permit prompt recognition and cor-rection of any unstable component of the EHDI pro-cess. 138 Quality Indicators for Screening Percentage of all newborn infants who completescreening by 1 month of age; the recommendedbenchmark is more than 95% (age correction for pre-term infants is acceptable). Percentage of all newborn infants who fail initialscreening and fail any subsequent rescreening beforecomprehensive audiological evaluation; the recom-mended benchmark is less than 4%. Quality Indicators for Conrmation of Hearing Loss Of infants who fail initial screening and any subse-quent rescreening, the percentage who complete acomprehensive audiological evaluation by 3 monthsof age; the recommended benchmark is 90%. For families who elect amplication, the percentage ofinfants with conrmed bilateral hearing loss who re-ceive amplication devices within 1 month of conr-mation of hearing loss; the recommended benchmarkis 95%. Quality Indicators for Early Intervention For infants with conrmed hearing loss who qualifyfor Part C services, the percentage for whom parentshave signed an IFSP by no later than 6 months of age;the recommended benchmark is 90%. For children with acquired or late-identied hearingloss, the percentage for whom parents have signed anIFSP within 45 days of the diagnosis; the recom-mended benchmark is 95%. The percentage of infants with conrmed hearing losswho receive the rst developmental assessment with 914 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from standardized assessment protocols (not criterion refer- ence checklists) for language, speech, and nonverbalcognitive development by no later than 12 months ofage; the recommended benchmark is 90%. CURRENT CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND FUTUREDIRECTIONS Despite the tremendous progress made since 2000, there are challenges to the success of the EHDI system. Challenges All of the following listed challenges are considered im- portant for the future development of successful EHDIsystems: Too many children are lost between the failed screen-ing and the rescreening and between the failed re-screening and the diagnostic evaluation. There is a shortage of professionals with skills andexpertise in both pediatrics and hearing loss, includingaudiologists, deaf educators, speech-language pathol-ogists, early intervention professionals, and physi-cians. There is often a lack of timely referral for diagnosis of,and intervention for, suspected hearing loss in chil-dren. Consistent and stable state and federal funding isneeded for program sustainability. When compared with services provided for adults,pediatric services in all specialties are poorly reim-bursed. Access to uniform Part C services is inadequate amongstates and within states. There is a lack of integrated state data-managementand -tracking systems. Demographics and cultural diversity are changing rap-idly. Funding for hearing aids, loaner programs, cochlearimplants, and FM systems is needed. There is a lack of specialized services for children withmultiple disabilities and hearing loss. Children may not qualify for services (state Part Cguidelines) before demonstrating language delays(prevention model versus decit model). Children may not qualify for assistive technology (pre-vention model versus decit model). There is a lack of in-service education for key profes-sionals. There are regulatory barriers to sharing informationamong providers and among states.No national standards exist for the calibration of OAE or ABR instrumentation, and there is a lack of uniformperformance standards. Opportunities for System Development and Research Establish programs to ensure the development of com-munication for infants and children with all degreesand types of hearing loss, allowing them access to alleducational, social, and vocational opportunitiesthroughout their life span. Develop improved, rapid, reliable screening technol-ogy designed to differentiate specic types of hearingloss. Develop and validate screening technologies for iden-tifying minimal hearing loss. Develop state data-management systems with the ca-pacity for the accurate determination of the preva-lence for delayed-onset or progressive hearing loss. Develop state data-tracking systems to follow infantswith suspected and conrmed hearing loss throughindividual state EHDI programs. Track the certication credentials of the service pro-viders for children with conrmed hearing loss whoare receiving Part C early intervention services andearly childhood special education. Track genetic, environmental, and pharmacologic fac-tors that contribute to hearing loss, thus allowing fortailored prevention and intervention strategies. Continue to rene electrophysiologic diagnostic tech-niques, algorithms, and equipment to enable frequen- cy-specic threshold assessment for use with veryyoung infants. Continue to rene techniques to improve the selec-tion and tting of appropriate amplication devices ininfants and young children. Conduct translational research pertaining to youngchildren with hearing loss, in particular, genetic, diag-nostic, and outcomes studies. Initiate prospective population-based studies to deter-mine the prevalence and natural history of auditoryneural conduction disorders. Conduct efcacy studies to determine appropriateearly intervention strategies for infants and childrenwith all degrees and types of hearing loss. Conduct additional studies on the efcacy of interven-tion for infants and children who receive cochlearimplants at younger than 2 years. Conduct additional studies on the efcacy of hearing-aid use in infants and children younger than 2 years. PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 4, October 2007 915 by on November 15, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Conduct additional studies of the auditory develop- ment of children who have appropriate amplicationdevices in early life. Expand programs within health, social service, andeducation agencies associated with early interventionand Head Start programs to accommodate the needs ofthe increasing numbers of early-identied children. Adapt education systems to capitalize on the abilitiesof children with hearing loss who have beneted fromearly identication and intervention. Develop genetic and medical procedures that will de-termine more rapidly the etiology of hearing loss. Ensure transition from Part C (early intervention) toPart B (education) services in ways that encouragefamily participation and ensure minimal disruption ofchild and family services. Study the effects of parents' participation in all aspectsof early intervention. Test the utility of a limited national data set and de-velop nationally accepted indicators of EHDI systemperformance. Encourage the identication and development of cen-ters of expertise in which specialized care is providedin collaboration with local service providers. Obtain the perspectives of individuals who are deaf orhard of hearing in developing policies regarding med-ical and genetic testing and counseling for familieswho carry genes associated with hearing loss. 139 CONCLUSIONSSince the 2000 JCIH statement, tremendous and rapidprogress has been made in the development of EHDIsystems as a major public health initiative. The percent-age of infants screened annually in the United States hasincreased from 38% to 95%. The collaboration at alllevels of professional organizations, federal and stategovernment, hospitals, medical homes, and families hascontributed to this remarkable success. New researchinitiatives to develop more sophisticated screening anddiagnostic technology, improved digital hearing-aid andFM technologies, speech-processing strategies in co-chlear implants, and early intervention strategies con-tinue. Major technological breakthroughs have beenmade in facilitating the denitive diagnosis of both ge-netic and nongenetic etiologies of hearing loss. In addi-tion, outcomes studies to assess the long-term outcomesof special populations, including infants and childrenwith mild and unilateral hearing loss, neural hearingloss, and severe or profound hearing loss managed withcochlear implants, have been providing information onthe individual and societal impact and the factors thatcontribute to an optimized outcome. It is apparent, how-ever, that there are still serious challenges to be over-come and system barriers to be conquered to achieveoptimal EHDI systems in all states in the next 5 years.Follow-up rates remain poor in many states, and fund-ing for amplication in children is inadequate. Fundingto support outcome studies is necessary to guide inter-vention and to determine factors other than hearing lossthat affect child development. The ultimate goal, to op-timize communication, social, academic, and vocationaloutcomes for each child with permanent hearing loss,must remain paramount.

Congratulations on the birth of your baby. You have received information that we provide hearing screening to all babies born. We are going to screen your baby now. Informing Parents of the Screen (Spanish): \u00a1Hola! Felicitaciones su beb\u00e9. Passing: Congratulations on the birth of your baby. We just completed the hearing screen; the results are a pass. Here is a brochure that talks about development of speech and language. It is always important to moni tor the progress of your baby's development, especially their speech and language because your baby's hearing can change any time. If you are ever worried that your baby can't hear, talk to your baby's doctor right away and ask for a referral to an audiologist that is skilled at testing infants and young children. Passing (Spanish): Pas\u00f3: Felicitaciones por el beb\u00e9 su peque\u00f1os. Not Passing: Congratulations on the birth of your baby. We just finished screening your baby's hearing. Your baby did not pass the screen toda y. This does not necessarily mean that your baby has a permanent hearing loss, but without additional testing we can't be sure. The screening results will be provided to your baby's doctor. Please be sure you make or keep (depending on your hospital's protocol) the appointment for further hearing testing. Not Passing (Spanish): No Pas\u00f3: Felicitaciones por el nacimiento de resultados auditivo hicimos de su hospital). Inconclusive: Although we attempt to provide newborn hearing screening to all babies born at our hospital, we were unable to complete the screening on your baby. It is important that your baby be screened as soon as possible. Let's schedule a time for the screening to be completed within the next 2 weeks. Inconclusive (Spanish): No Concluyente: Aunque entrantes. Not Passing Outpatient Rescreen: Your baby did not pass the second screen. The screening does not tell us whether your baby has a hearing loss; it just tells us that further testing should be done as soon as possible. The next step is to get a diagnostic ABR as soon as possible. This should be discussed immediately with your baby's doc tor who may need to help you with obtaining a referral to a pediatric audiologist. Not Passing Outpatient (Spanish): No Pas\u00f3 El Segundo pediatra. High Risk: Passing: Congratulations on the birth of your baby. We screened your baby's hearing and the results are a pass. However, because your baby has had some medical problems at birth, there is a chance that your baby can develop a hearing loss after you leave the hospital. Your baby's hearing is critical for normal speech and language development, so it is important that you speak to your baby's doctor who can help you in knowing when your baby should have further tests with a pediatric audiologist and can also help you to monitor for normal speech and language development. High Risk: Passing (Spanish) Felicitaciones por el nacimiento de su beb\u00e9 pas\u00f3 tamizaje auditivo que audici\u00f3n es importante para desarrollo del beb\u00e9. Es que lenguaje de su beb\u00e9. High Risk: Not Passing Congratulations on the birth of your baby. Your baby received a hearing screen and the results show that your baby did not pass . There can be simple reasons for this, but without further testing with a pediatric audiologi st, I cannot tell you what your baby hears. Because your baby has had some medical problem s at birth, your baby is at a greater risk for a hearing loss. Please discuss these results with your baby's doctor and ask them to help you schedule diagnostic tests with a pediatric audiologist as soon as possible. Finding out about hearing issues as early as possible will help to ensure that your baby has the best chance to develop normal speech and language. High Risk: Not Passing (Spanish) Felicitaciones por el nacimiento de su beb\u00e9. Su beb\u00e9 el normal.

Additional Information and Application: www.sotheworldmayhear.org Lions Affordable Hearing Aid Program (AHAP) Sertoma Clubs The Lions AHAP is rooted in a continuum of care Sertoma stands for SERvice TO MA nkind. Community Hearin g Aid Program, Inc. (CHAP) CHAP is an independent charity funded by St. Luke's Health Initiatives, BHHS Legacy Foundation, This list was compiled to assist families in obtaining funding to cover the costs of model involving hearing care professionals and focuses on low -income benefici aries. The hearing aid is one part of the solution to hear ing impair ment. Also needed are the services of hearing care professionals to conduct tests, order ear molds, program the hearing aids and do follow -up care. Currently Lions AHAP is distributing two hearing aids through a partnership with Rexton, Inc. in cooperation with participating Lions foundations, districts and clubs, and hearing care professionals. Lions clubs, districts and hearing programs are able to order one or both aids from Lions AHAP. A Lions club decides the eligibility of a person, and the person is tested by a hearing care professional. The Lions club sends the order to Lions AHAP, who notifies the manufacturer. The hearing aid is shipped to the hearing care professional listed on the order form. The hearing care professional fits the hearing aid for the person. Individuals cannot apply directly to Lions Club International Foundation; he/she must work through his/her local Lions club. How does the Lions AHAP program work? The criteria for eligibility are income- based. This includes using the federal government's poverty guidelines and adjusting it to the local economy. The hearing aids are for the segment of the population who would never be able to purchase hearing aids. Eligibility Each club has their own criteria and application process. For further information on the program, contact the Lions AHAP office at (630) 468-6771 or e-mail LionsAHAP@lionsclubs.org You can also contact a club near you by going to the Lions International website: www.lionsclubs.org Sertoma's primary focus is on assisting the more than 50 million people with hearing health issues and educating the public on the issues surrounding hearing health. In order to achieve these goals Sertoma has undertaken a multi -faceted approach by launching programs that address both the treatment and prevention aspects of heari ng health. Communicative Disorders Scholarships There is a $1,000 Scholarship for hard of hearing or deaf students that have clinically significant bilateral hearing loss. Graduating high school seniors or undergraduate students must be pursuing a four year degree. There is also a $1,000 Scholarship for graduate students who have been accepted into a graduate level program in audiology or speech- language pathology at institutions in the United States. Sertoma provides more funds nationally for graduate level study in communicative disorders than any other single organization. Other Services: Sertoma Affiliates are non- profit hearing and speech facilities that have established a relationship with a Sertoma Club or have an independent relationship with Sertoma. This relationship results in greater service to people with communicative disorders by supporting the prof essional staff and programs of the affiliate. There are 7 Sertoma clubs in Arizona.

Genes ar e what cause parents to pass traits (like eye color) or health condi ti ons (like Diabetes) along to their children. The Sickle gene (S) a ects the red blood cells. Sickle Cell Trait (AS) occurs when a person inherits a Normal gene (A) from one parent, and a Sickle gene (S) from the other. Sickle Cell Trait is usually a very mild condi ti on. Sickle Cell Disease is a serious blood disease that c an be very painful. Sickle Cell Trait is NOT Sickle Cell Disease. It does not make people sick the way Sickle Cell Disease does. Problems with Sickle Cell Trait are RARE. Mos t people with Sickle Cell Trait (AS) cannot tell that they have it. Millions of people have Sickle Cell Trait (AS) . They are ne, and they lead acti ve lives. A few people with the Trait (AS) may have: Blood in the urine, from ti me to ti me Some pain and discomfort at high al ti tudes (lik e in the mountains or in certain ci ti es that are high above sea level) Problems with extreme exercise in hot, humid w eather, when not drinking enough water. Each parent has two genes, and each parent passes one gene along to the baby. The Sickle gene (S) runs in many families. The Sickle gene (S) is found in people from many di erent countries. It is found in: Africans, African-Americans, West Indians Lati nos, Brazilians and in other people from Central and South America Italians, Greeks and other people from other Mediterranean countries East Indians, Asians and people from countries in the Middle East MOST IMPORTANT: You CAN have a baby with Sickle Cell Disease, in the future. You can pass y our Sickle gene (S) along to any of your children in the future. So, nd out if your partner also has a gene that can cause Sickle Cell Disease. It could be an (S) gene or another gene. If so, any of your children can be born with the disease. Ask, him or her to be tested to nd out. Most important both parents should be tested. Individuals with Sickle Cell Trait should inform their doctor about their condi ti on.

Bal ti more Street Suite 800 Balti more, MD 21202 410.528.1555 (Phone) Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening (CF NBS) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What is a \"positive CF NBS\" and what does it mean? It means that the immuno reactive trypsinogen assay (IRT) tested above the 97.8%ile or the day of the test. This triggered DNA analysis for 46 common CF genes in our population. That test was positive for at least 1 CF gene mutation. This test is only done on the first sample. 2. Does that mean my patient has CF? That means that child possesses at least 1 common gene for CF gene mutation. It also means one of their parents also must carry the gene. Your patient is at least a carrier of one CF gene mutation. 3. I thought you needed 2 gene mutations to have CF? This is true . CF is an autosomal recessive disease. A child could have one common CF gene mutation and one uncommon CF gene mutation. Only the common CF gene mutation would be detected in the newborn screen. This panel of 46 common CF gene mutations accounts for about 92% of CF disease. At this time there are over 1400 known CF gene mutations. That's why the positive NBS needs further evaluation. 4. Why don't we just send a genetic test for DNA? Unless you test for all the genes with expanded testing (which takes weeks and is very expensive) you will not have a definitive answer. Sometimes after the genetics are obtained the answers still remain unclear . The patient may have a new novel gene mutation and may even involve testing other family members as well. It is an expensive process that can delay an a ccurate diagnosis. 5. So the patient has a +NBS; what should I do now? At a minimum the child needs to obtain a sweat chloride test at a qualified testing center facility. Currently, those centers are at Phoenix Children's Hospital and Saint Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix and University Medical Center in Tucson. 6. What will happen at the NBS clinic visit? After you receive a call from the CF center regarding the +NBS, a test can be arranged, including follow up management of the patient and testing. The child may be seen at the time of the sweat chloride exam. During this visit the child is assessed for e arly subtle signs of CF. The family is also given accurate information about CF and given genetic counseling for family regarding the CF gene mutation. This service includes information back to your office about the testing and any further implications for your patient and their family. Providing accurate and rapid testing for your patient and information to you and your patient's family will follow. Please have your referral coordinator obtain an authorization for both a visit/consultation and testing. The ICD -9 code is 796.6. 7. If a child had a positive CF NBS what should we do about a sibling? The CF NBS in Arizona started in 10/07. If a child has a + NBS for CF, any siblings that have not been previously screened (because they were born before Arizona began screening or were born in a state that didn't screen for CF) should have a sweat chloride. 8. Does the NBS detect all CF patients? CF NBS detection rate is about 92%. Meaning 8 % of children could be lost to care through a variety of re asons . The program detailed above is an attempt to limit some of the extraneous factors causing a delay to diagnosis or misinformation about CF. 9. Now that there is a CF NBS can I take CF out of a patient differential diagnosis? Absolutely not, as mentioned above CF NBS could miss 8 % of diagnoses. This means that any child with, for example, failure to thrive, recurrent pneumonia, chronic diarrhea or malabsorption it should be left high in the differential. CF is a common illness present in 1/3,100 in the Caucasian population. Please obtain a sweat chloride for that child; it is an easy, inexpensive test that can aid your diagnostic process. 10. If I have further questions who can I call? Pediatric CF and NBS director at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Pulmonology (602) 546-0985. Dr. Wayne Morgan, Tucson Cystic Fibrosis Center at (520) 626-7780. A pediatric pulmonologist of your choice Another source of accurate information regarding CF is the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation at www.CFF.org . Thanks to Dana Valletta from PCH CF Center for creating this valuable resource. She can be reached at 602-546-0985 Arizona Hemoglobin Bart's Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers Hemoglobin Barts Alpha thalassemia is caused by deletions of the alpha globin genes on chromosome 16. Normal individuals have 4 copies of the gene with 2 on each chromosome. It is possible to lose 1 to 4 of these genes. The presence of hemoglobin Bart's on newborn screen usually suggests that the infant is missing at least 1 alp ha gene. Your patient has been found on the Arizona Newborn Genetic Screen to have a hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern consistent with \"FA Bart's \". The acronym stands for t he hemoglobin species present in the baby's blood in descending order of prevalence. The F designates fetal hemoglobin (a2 y2), A denotes hemoglobin -globin molecules (y4). Hemoglobin Barts (y4) appears in the newborn when one or more of the 4 human a -globin genes are missing. The relative over abundance of y-globin molecules leads to y4 production and the diagnosis of Hemoglobin Barts. The silent carrier : One deleted Alpha Gene Neonates and children with three functional alpha genes have a complete or nearly completely silent phenotype. The red cell indices are normal and remain so for life. When only one a gene is non- functional, the hemoglobin Barts percentage is usually 1 -2% in the newborn, and is not detectable when the fetal hemoglobin synthesis stops at 6 months of age. As the newborn matures, the red cells can rarely exhibit a reduced MCV, MCH, but will show normal HBA2 and F levels if the hemoglobin electrophoresis is repeated. This condition is clinically benign, and these patients require no other evaluation or special health care. Alpha thalassemia trait: Two Deleted Alpha Genes Neonates and children with only 2 functional alpha genes will show alpha thalassemia trait. In the newborn period, Hemoglobin Barts is detected in the range of 5 -6%. Most alpha thalassemia carriers will be mildly anemic, won't respond to iron therapy, and show mildly abnormal red cell indices. There is no specific treatment for the carrier state, but genetic counseling should be considered later in the child's life as it is possible that offspring could develop Hemoglobin H or hydrops. Individuals from SE Asia will often have the genes del eted from the same chromosome ( cis mutation) while those of African heritage will have genes deleted from both chromosomes ( trans mutation). Hemoglobin H disease occurs when there is only one functional gene , and these individuals can have a mild to moderate thalassemia. Most patients are anemic and develop splenomegaly although the clinical manifestations can be variable. These children would require care at a pediatric hematology/oncology center for moderat e to severe symptoms. Hemoglobin H Disease: Three Deleted Alpha Genes This is also known as alpha thalassemia major. This is rarely compatible with life unless detected early. Those patients would be transfusion dependent, but death usually occurs in utero or in early infancy unless detected prenatally. Fetal Hydrops: All Four Alpha Genes Deleted At 2-3 months, examine infant for splenomegaly and do a CBC. If normal and hemoglobin electrophoresis did not report abnormal hemoglobin other than Bart's then Hemoglobin H disease is unlikely and no further work -up is necessary until 9 -2 months. If CBC or exam are abnormal, please consult a pediatric hematologist. Follow -Up Recommendations: Between 9- 12 months check CBC and reticulocyte count. If this is normal, then the child likely is a silent carrier. No f urther work -up of the child is necessary. If infant is microcytic, do iron studies and treat with 3 -6 months of iron if found to have iron deficiency. If the microcytosis resolves with iron therapy, then the child is likely a silent carrier and needs no further evaluation. If the patient has persistent microcytosis, then they likely have alpha thalassemia trait. The parents of a child with hemoglobin Bart's should also have CBC's performed, particularly if parents are of Asian ancestry. If the parents are microcytic, then further genetic testing and counseling should be done as there may be a risk of Hemoglobin H disease or hydrops in future children. A diagnosis of a silent carrier or alpha thalassemia does not necessarily constitute a reason to refer you r patient to a pediatric hematology/oncology center. However, should questions or other circumstances arise in the lives of the affected children, for consultation contact Dr. Brenda Wittman or the pediatric hematologist on call at the University of Arizona School of Medicine at (520) 626-8278 or through Physician's Resource Service at (520) 694-5868.
