The other factors are not listed in order of importance.

For a CNS concern, even if the clinical treatment duration is short, a longer dosing period in animals can be appropriate oPost-treatment period assessments: (1) reversibility, persistence, progression; (2) delayed onset of effectsSection3: Design of nonclinicaljuvenileanimal studies 19 Dose selection: oDetermination of a dose-response and No Observed Adverse Effect Level is desirable oSome overlap with adult doses is desirable oHigh dose should not result in marked toxicity that can confound the growth and development endpoints and complicate the assessment oDose adjustment should be considered in cases of substantial changes in systemic exposureSection3: Design of nonclinicaljuvenileanimal studies 208/3/2020 11 Specific guidance when drug will be administered to paediatric patients without any prior adult data: two JAS are recommended (rodent and non-rodent) If first-in-human is in adult, standard toxicity study approach can be used or one or both toxicity studies could be initiated in juvenile animals. Juvenile primate study to be conducted only after careful consideration oAlternative approaches (in vitro assays, genetically-modified animals, surrogate molecules) should be considered oPost-weaning juvenile non-human primate (10-12 months of age) when it is the only relevant species and needed for paediatric first/only oPre-weaning non-human primate limited primarily to neonatal use there are no alternativesSection4: Paediatric-first/ Paediatric-onl y 21 Endpoint interpretation oImportance of age-matched concurrent control data oImportance of maternal care and health status of the litter oGrowth: Body weight and food consumption can help differentiate between direct/indirect effects on bone development oInterpretation of organ weights and onset of sexual development in the context of growth Overall interpretation oIntegrated assessment should be made, comparing available findings in juvenile and adult animals (new effects, differences in sensitivity, recovery, age of the animals and exposures at which the effects were observed), and relate these to intended paediatric useSection5: Data interpretation 228/3/2020 12 23Section 6: Other Considerations Excipients oAvailable information on the excipients should be evaluated and a WoE approach should be followed. oIf there are insufficient data, further safety evaluation can be warranted. Combination Pharmaceuticals oICH M3 principles on combinations apply. oJAS considered only if previous information insufficient and a JAS will address concerns. oIf JAS is appropriate, it might be sufficient to -study the combination only -or add an extra group in a single entity JAS. CASE STUDIES APPLYING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE APPROACH A. A small molecule with known pharmacology has available adult clinical and nonclinical data including repeated-dose toxicity data. None of these data suggest a safety concern in a developing organ for the intended paediatric population of adolescents (12 years and above) for a one-month duration of clinical treatment. The WoE analysis indicates that additional nonclinical investigations will not contribute useful information.Appendix B 24Neonates (<1 Month) Yes No Chronic Use Acute UseYoungest Intended Patient Age Effects on Developing Organ Systems Pharmacological Target has Role In Organ Development Clinical Treatment DurationLow HighSelectivity and Specificity of PharmaceuticalWoE FactorsFurther Studies LikelyFurther Studies Unlikely Yes No No Nonclinical Adult Nonclinical Adult Pediatric or Clinical Data Only Clinical ClinicalAmount/Type of Existing Data Infant (1-23 Months) Child (2-11 Years)Adolescent (12 Years)8/3/2020 13 B. A small molecule with a novel mode of action intended for chronic use starting in neonates or infants has limited Phase 1 clinical and nonclinical safety data with no significant safety concerns identified. There are potential effects on developing organ systems based on the pharmacology. The WoE analysis indicates further nonclinical investigation, such as a JAS with additional endpoints based on the targeted developing organ systems, would be useful. . 25Neonates (<1 Month) Yes No Chronic Use Acute UseYoungest Intended Patient Age Effects on Developing Organ Systems Pharmacological Target has Role In Organ Development Clinical Treatment DurationLow HighSelectivity and Specificity of PharmaceuticalWoE FactorsFurther Studies LikelyFurther Studies Unlikely Yes No No Nonclinical Adult Nonclinical Adult Pediatric or Clinical Data Only Clinical ClinicalAmount/Type of Existing Data Infant (1-23 Months) Child (2-11 Years)Adolescent (12 Years)CASE STUDIES APPLYING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE APPROACH Appendix B C. A small molecule with a pharmacological target that has an established critical role in CNS development is intended for chronic use in children (6 years and above). Nonclinical and adult clinical data are available. The concern for a potential effect on the developing CNS cannot be addressed clinically by monitoring and management. Existing data adequately address other developing systems. The WoE analysis warrants a postweaning JAS design that includes core endpoints and additional CNS endpoints to address the specific concern. . 26Neonates (<1 Month) Yes No Chronic Use Acute UseYoungest Intended Patient Age Effects on Developing Organ Systems Pharmacological Target has Role In Organ Development Clinical Treatment DurationLow HighSelectivity and Specificity of PharmaceuticalWoE FactorsFurther Studies LikelyFurther Studies Unlikely Yes No No Nonclinical Adult Nonclinical Adult Pediatric or Clinical Data Only Clinical ClinicalAmount/Type of Existing Data Infant (1-23 Months) Child (2-11 Years)Adolescent (12 Years)CASE STUDIES APPLYING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE APPROACH Appendix B8/3/2020 14 D. A monoclonal antibody targets a soluble cytokine and is intended for chronic paediatric use in rheumatologic and allergic diseases (>2 years old). The only findings are reversible decreased serum Ig and occasional injection site reactions (in both animals and adult patients). In a monkey ePPND study, offspring exposure was comparable to dams through PND 28 and decreased thereafter. T-cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR) results were similar to controls (between 3-6 months postnatally). The WoE analysis does not warrant a JAS. . 27Neonates (<1 Month) Yes No Chronic Use Acute UseYoungest Intended Patient Age Effects on Developing Organ Systems Pharmacological Target has Role In Organ Development Clinical Treatment DurationLow HighSelectivity and Specificity of PharmaceuticalWoE FactorsFurther Studies LikelyFurther Studies Unlikely Yes No No Nonclinical Adult Nonclinical Adult Pediatric or Clinical Data Only Clinical ClinicalAmount/Type of Existing Data Infant (1-23 Months) Child (2-11 Years)Adolescent (12 Years)CASE STUDIES APPLYING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE APPROACH Appendix B Study should be designed to reduce potential confounders related to maternal care, litter size and other factors such as genetics. oThis can be achieved by taking into account: -Construction of the study litters -Assignment of study litters to dose groups -Assignment of individual pups to endpoint subsets oThoughtfulstudy designs which include appropriate endpoints and animal allocation can minimize the number of litters and total animals usedAppendix C: Approachestopreweaning litter allocation in therodent 288/3/2020 15 oDefinitive rat JAS with a dosing interval from PND 14 - 63 oIncluding core endpoints (with TK assessments on PND 14, 22, 63) study-specific endpoints (post-treatment necropsy and CNS assessments) Example-preweaninglitterallocationRAT 29 30Guidelines for Implementation As noted in the guideline, early consideration of nonclinical support for paediatric pharmaceutical development is recommended. Some regulatory agencies have procedures for defining paediatric development plans (see ICH E11). Early regulatory interaction is encouraged for efficient paediatric drug development.8/3/2020 16 31Contact For any questions "}
