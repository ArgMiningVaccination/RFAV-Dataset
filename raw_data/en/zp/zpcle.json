Risk owners have been asked to update curr ent mitigation and action plans . 1.3 The next formal review of the strategic risk and opportunity r egister will take pla ce in May 2022, and of the operational risk r egister in July 2022. Risk registers are however a live document and will be regularly discussed at D irectorate Management Teams. 2.0 Strategic Risk and Opportunity Register - Monitoring Summary 2.1 Attac hed to this report at Appendix A is the updated strategic risk r egister. The Appendix offers additional information including detail on Key Controls and Sources of Assurance and how progress against mitigation will be measured. 3.0 Strategic Risk Register 3.1 There have been t hree new risks added to the strategic ri sk register bringi ng the total risks managed to 120. The three new risks relate to cyber -attacks ( number 3 in table one ), staff resilience to causative factors of stress ( number 17 in table one ) and the additional upfront contributions to offset the Counci l's pension fund deficit, made in 2019/20 (number 18 in table one). Three risks have a rating of Red; these relate to responding to the growing volume and complexity of demand on the Children, Young People and Families Service and Adult Social Care Service and the new risk regarding cyber -attacks . All other risks have seen no change in the risk rating score. The 'red risks' are shown below: Risk number one relates to the 'hidden harm' consequences of COVID -19 infection control measures and safe systems of work that are adding to existing pressures on the Children, Young People and Families service. The service is continuing to see a rise in children coming into care. Risk number two relates to workforce concerns and the growing fragility of the Adult Soci al Care Market that might lead to the inability of the Local Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eligible need. Risk number three relates to the potential for a cyber -attack to render all of the Council's IT inaccessible for an extended period of time therefore impacting on the Councils ability to deliver services. 3.2 Strategic Risk update table Table one p rovides an update on mitigation in place for all of the 20 risks on the strategic risk register.

The risk to economic performance is a combination of the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus, Brexit, labour shortages , infrastructure challenges relati ng to material supply and general uncertainty in many sectors. Some of the long -term effects (especially without effective policy instruments) are likely to carry over in 2022 and beyond. The impact of COVID -19 on the economy has been sharp and has affected different sectors of the economy in different ways. We are focussing, through Resurgam, on six areas to help our economy to recover, to protect local jobs and to support our communities. These are: - Spend 4 Plymouth - A massive focus on l ocal procurement for local jobs - Build 4 Plymouth - An ambitious capital programme and economic stimulus to support construction jobs, buildin g a better and greener Plymouth - Skills 4 Plymouth - Extensi ve new support for young people and retraining our workforce for future job s through our skills launch pad - City Centre Renaissance programme - support for our city centre and a regeneration plan - Resurgam Beacons - A focus on our future. We will seek to create new jobs in the blue and green economy. That is our amazing marine secto r and a new green deal for jobs - Sector Action Plans - a bespoke package of interventions led by the private sector fo r our 11 key sectors, building on our Resurgam plans and innovating and collaborating together though our newly established Sector Hub. Supporting our sectors whether they are in critical shock, stable, or capable of high growth. These sectors are: - Constr uction and the Built Environment - Creative Industries 16 Amber Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner - Digital - Defence - Health and Care - Fishing - Manufacturing - Marine - Retail - Tourism and Hospitality - Transport and Distribution . We have also established the cross cutting theme of inclusive growth. Our aim is to 'build back better' , growing a prosperous economy that reduces inequality, is sustainable and truly serves the wellbeing of all of the people of Plymouth. 5 Ongoing COVID -19 rates (with potential for further peaks) affect city's recovery / reset plans. It is not yet clear what mitigations will be needed for us to live with COVID -19. There remains a high risk of further waves but the timing is not certain. Rates remain high and as expected have increased over the Winter p eriod. The greatest risk remains from new infectious variants that are both more severe in terms of their effects and are vaccine resistant. - The key mitigation of vaccinati on has now reached around 85% (one or more doses) of those eligible. The roll out to younger children is likely to start soon. - However there are likely to be reductions in the mitigations currently in place (reduced testing, support payments and legal need for self isolation) and this creates uncertainty around case rates and the risk o f delayed detection of new variants. 16 Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner 6 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Mounting evidence that COVID -19 is having differential health impacts across communities, adding to existing health inequalities. This is through either the disease itself or the mitigations put in place. There is an ongoing impact of this due to the economic downturn. The primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to try to manage COVID - 19 in the city , therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. Persistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The public health team and partners continue to work with employers (year one focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You cam paign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the city as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The focus on arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations) continued throughout 2020 and 2021. The Thrive Plymouth Network will re -start and continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure delivery of the programme. D iscussions are ongoing about Year Seven of the Programme , which is likely to focus on Trauma Informed. Evidence has been provided to the Health and Wellbeing Board on the risk of widening health inequalities and partners are working together to try to miti gate. The local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and include tackling inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tac kle health inequalities in the c ity. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross -party Child Poverty Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to minimise the impact of COVID -19 in the city, therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. 16 Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner 7 Increased and sustained pressure on Adult Social Care budget due to increased costs of providing care, growing numbers of people and increased complexity of need.

The Plymouth Standards Partnership Recovery & Improvement Plan: A key priority is work to support disadvantaged pupils. The work of the Plymouth Commission has been extended to focus on attainment for secondary aged pupils and school improvement. This has also focussed on the impact of the COVID -19 response arrangements, and a survey of all secondary schools has been undertaken to inform priorities for re -engaging pupils in September. Schools are expected to have the capacity to offer immediate remote educa tion for classes or groups who are required to self -isolate for a short period of time, or where there are local restrictions requiring pupils to remain 15 Amber Alison Botham PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner at home.

The Council also holds an annual review of fees and charges and has annual and ongoing programmes of work to identify and understand potential savings opportunities. The governance s ystem of the Council - as unpacked in the Annual Governance Statement comprise a rigorous system of financial control.

Register in January 2022) 18 In 2019/20 the Council adopted under legal advice a proposal to make additional upfront contributions to offset the Council's pension fund deficit. During the audit of the 2019/20 accounts - which was delayed because of the Pandemic - it became apparent that the External Auditor did not agree that the accounting treatment used was lawful. During 2021 the Council has taken further legal advice to identify a way of acc ounting for the transaction that is agreed with the External Auditor ; consideration of this advice continues at the present time. The risk is that if a mutually acceptable way of accounting for the transaction cannot be agreed with the External Auditor an d advising counsel then the Council may need to explore alternative means of achieving a solution which sit within the appropriate legal parameters. - Liaison with legal advisers - Consultation with the Auditor - Possible consultation with Government TBC - subject to further legal advice Brendan Arnold PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Current risk rating Risk Owner 19 Risk of failing to deliver the range of housing to meet Plymouth's need . - Strategic Land Review completed and released 50 housing sites to the market. - Established Housing Investment Fund in Plan for Homes 3 to support interventions to unlock housing delivery. - Working with Homes England to develop a Placed Based Strategic Partnership to unlock and deliver a pipeline of housing sites, support City Centre renaissance and to help align Government funding with housing site opportunities.
