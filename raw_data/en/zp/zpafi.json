This page was updated on April 29, 2022. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the most commonly used form of [radiation](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy) oncology treatment. It uses high-dose radiation to destroy cancerous cells or shrink tumors. During an EBRT procedure, a machine directs external beams of radiation into cancerous areas inside your body with extreme precision. This method helps reduce damage to healthy tissues. EBRT is designed and monitored by a radiation oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation. Treatment is typically given daily, Monday through Friday, on an outpatient basis over the course of a number of weeks. However, treatment is tailored to the patient's individual needs, so some may need to go more or less often. Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) is now City of Hope\u00ae, joining forces to expand patient access to personalized, comprehensive cancer care. Using a special [X-ray](/diagnosing-cancer/diagnostic-imaging/x-ray) machine called a linear accelerator, EBRT delivers high-energy rays to tumors. The machine delivers radiation from any angle and shapes radiation beams to the contour of the tumor. The machine moves around the body without touching the patient, aiming radiation at the cancer. Some types of focused EBRT target a tumor with higher, more precise doses of radiation, while reducing damage to healthy tissue and nearby organs. As a result, modern EBRT may help reduce the risk of side effects associated with traditional radiation treatment. Every patient's experience during EBRT varies depending on the type of cancer, the size and location of the tumor and the type of therapy being used. But there are some general rules and expectations most patients should consider. For instance: EBRT treatments are typically outpatient procedures. The length of your treatment depends on many factors, including your type and stage of cancer. EBRT may be administered over a period of weeks. Patients typically receive treatment once a day for five days in a row, generally Monday through Friday. The actual treatments last only a few minutes, but each session requires time to set up equipment and ensure the patient is in the correct position for treatment. This radiation therapy technique allows doctors to sculpt radiation beams to the shape of a tumor and is typically used on tumors with irregular shapes or that lie close to healthy tissues and organs, and may limit radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue. 3-D conformal radiation also allows doctors to view tumors in three dimensions. Based on these images, the radiation beams are delivered to the tumor from several angles. With [IMRT](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy/external-beam-radiation/intensely-modulated-radiation-therapy), advanced software plans a precise dose of radiation, based on tumor size, shape and location. A computer-controlled device delivers the radiation in sculpted doses that match the 3-D geometrical shape of the tumor, including concave and complex shapes. The intensity of radiation beams can be adjusted across the treatment area in fractioned, separate beams as precision accuracy. This means higher doses of radiation can be delivered than traditional radiation therapy methods, while reducing exposure to healthy tissues. Because of its greater degree of accuracy, IMRT may be a treatment option for patients who have reached the maximum allowable dose of conventional radiation therapy and have a recurrent tumor in the treated area. Tumors can shift inside the body, because of breathing and other movement. Image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may allow doctors to locate and track tumors at the time of treatment and deliver more precise radiation treatment. This technology also allows our radiation oncologists to make technical adjustments when a tumor moves outside of the planned treatment range. As a result, the radiation treatment is targeted to the tumor as much as possible, helping to limit radiation exposure to healthy tissue and reduce common [radiation side effects](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy/side-effects). [TomoTherapy\u00ae](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy/external-beam-radiation/tomotherapy) combines a form of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), with the accuracy of [computed tomography (CT)](/diagnosing-cancer/diagnostic-imaging/ct-scans) scanning technology, in one machine. With this technology, we sculpt radiation doses to match complex tumor shapes while avoiding sensitive structures. Using built-in CT scanning to confirm the shape and position of the tumor before each treatment, TomoTherapy may reduce radiation exposure to healthy tissues and organs. Before every treatment, scanning technology provides a 3D image of the treatment area, so the radiation beams can be targeted according to the size, shape and location of the tumor(s) on that specific day. The \"slice therapy\" approach treats tumors one layer at a time. Side effects are often reduced because less radiation reaches healthy tissues and organs. Some cancer patients who have reached their maximum tolerance dose of traditional radiation may be a candidate for TomoTherapy radiation. These procedures are designed to deliver precise, highly concentrated doses of radiation to small areas in the body, allowing our radiation oncologists to reduce exposure to surrounding healthy tissue and limit the number of treatment sessions required. We use two types of stereotactic procedures: [stereotactic radiosurgery](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy/external-beam-radiation/stereotactic-radiosurgery) and [stereotactic body radiation therapy](/treatment-options/radiation-therapy/external-beam-radiation/stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy). External beam radiation therapy is used to treat many [cancer types](/cancer-types), including some of the most common cancers. Standard radiation therapy treatments may damage some healthy cells, often causing unpleasant side effects. The side effects of EBRT may vary depending on the length of treatment and the part of the body being treated. A common side effect for EBRT for all cancers is fatigue. All other side effects only occur near the site being treated. For example: At City of Hope, we understand that many patients do not realize how the side effects of cancer treatments may affect them. That's why we take the time to educate patients\u2014before, during and after treatment\u2014about how their bodies will respond and provide an array of supportive care therapies designed to help them maintain their strength, stamina and quality of life.
