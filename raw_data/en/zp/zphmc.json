Bach flower remedies are remedies made from flowers that help to address low levels of energy and low mood. They work on an individual's mental, emotional and spiritual state of being which is why they are great at helping low energy (and low drive). For physical exhaustion the most important low energy remedy in the Bach flower range is Olive, however there may be other more relevant flower remedies depending on how you feel. They were developed by Dr Edward Bach, an English physician who understood that people's emotional problems could be helped with natural remedies. He began his work in the 1930s and developed 38 remedies, one for each different emotion. They are similar to homeopathic remedies and Dr Bach originally worked within homeopathy before creating his own system focused solely on the emotional state of patients.
