The patient was first vaccinated in May 2021 with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vector vaccine, followed by two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in July and December 2021. The family of the deceased requested an autopsy due to ambiguous clinical signs before death. PD was confirmed by post-mortem examinations. Furthermore, signs of aspiration pneumonia and systemic arteriosclerosis were evident. However, histopathological analyses of the brain uncovered previously unsuspected findings, including acute vasculitis (predominantly lymphocytic) as well as multifocal necrotizing encephalitis of unknown etiology with pronounced inflammation including glial and lymphocytic reaction. In the heart, signs of chronic cardiomyopathy as well as mild acute lympho-histiocytic myocarditis and vasculitis were present. Although there was no history of COVID-19 for this patient, immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike and nucleocapsid proteins) was performed. Surprisingly, only spike protein but no nucleocapsid protein could be detected within the foci of inflammation in both the brain and the heart, particularly in the endothelial cells of small blood vessels. Since no nucleocapsid protein could be detected, the presence of spike protein must be ascribed to vaccination rather than to viral infection. The findings corroborate previous reports of encephalitis and myocarditis caused by gene-based COVID-19 vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-01", "cleaned_text": "A Case Report: Multifocal Necrotizing Encephalitis these vaccines to be marketed as soon as 1-2 years after development had begun. Published results of the phase 3 clinical trials described only a few severe side effects [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01651), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01651), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01651), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01651)]. However, it has since become clear that severe and even fatal adverse events may occur; these include in particular cardiovascular and neurological manifestations [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01651), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01651), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01651), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01651), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01651)]. Clinicians should take note of such case reports for the sake of early detection and management of such adverse events among their patients. In addition, a thorough post-mortem examination of deaths in connection with COVID-19 vaccination should be considered in ambiguous circumstances, including histology. This report presents the case of a senior aged 76 years old, who had received three doses overall of two different COVID-19 vaccines, and who died three weeks after the second dose of the mRNA-BNT162b-vaccine. Autopsy and histology revealed unexpected necrotizing encephalitis and mild myocarditis with pathological changes in small blood vessels. A causal connection of these findings to the preceding COVID-19 vaccination was established by immunohistochemical demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The methodology introduced in this study should be useful for distinguishing between causation by COVID-19 vaccination or infection in ambiguous cases. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Routine Histology 2.2. Immunohistochemistry [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01651-t001). Incubation with the primary antibody was carried out for 30 min in each case. Tissues from SARS-CoV-2-positive COVID-19 patients were used as a control for the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2-spike and nucleocapsid ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01651-f001)). Cultured cells that had been transfected in vitro (see hereafter) served as a positive control for the detection of vaccine-induced spike protein expression and as a negative control for the detection of nucleocapsid protein. The slides were examined with a light microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE 80i) and representative images were captured by the camera system Motic\u00ae Europe Motic MP3. 2.3. Preparation of Positive Control Samples for the Immunohistochemical Detection of the Vaccine-Induced Spike Protein 2.4. Case Presentation and Description 2.4.1. Clinical History 2.4.2. Autopsy 3. Results 3.1. Autopsy Findings 2](#vaccines-10-01651-t002). Staining 3](#vaccines-10-01651-f003)). Furthermore, there were and lymphocytic reactions as well as predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates and Nucleus ruber on both sides. In some places with inflammatory changes in brain capillaries, there were also signs of apoptotic cell death within the endothelium ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-01651-f004)). Meninges' findings were suggestive of multifocal necrotizing encephalitis. Furthermore, chronic arteriosclerotic lesions of varying degrees were noted in large brain vessels, which are described in detail in section \"Vascular system\". [Figure 5](#vaccines-10-01651-f005)). Furthermore, there were chronic arteriosclerotic lesions of varying degrees, which are described in detail under \"Vascular system\". In addition to these, there were more acute myocardial and vascular changes in the heart. They consisted of mild signs of myocarditis, characterized by infiltrations with foamy histiocytes and lymphocytes as well as hypereosinophilia and some hypercontraction of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, mild acute vascular changes were observed in the capillaries and other small blood vessels of the heart. They consisted of mild lympho-histiocytic infiltrates, prominent endothelial swelling and vacuolation, multifocal myocytic degeneration coagulation necrosis as well as karyopyknosis of single endothelial cells and vascular muscle cells ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-10-01651-f005)). Occasionally, adhering plasma coagulates/fibrin clots were present endothelial surface, indicative of endothelial damage ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-10-01651-f005)). 3.2. Other Findings - - - Oral cavity: tongue bite was detected with bleeding under the tongue muscle (tongue bite is common with epileptic seizures). - - - Adrenal glands: bilateral mild cortical hyperplasia. - - - elongated sigmoid colon was elongated with fecal impaction. - - - Kidneys: slight diffuse glomerulosclerosis and arterio-sclerosis, renal cortical scars (up to 10 mm in diameter), bilateral mild active nephritis and urocystitis as well as evidence of shock kidney disorder. - - - Liver: slight lipofuscinosis. - - - Spleen: mild acute splenitis. - - - Stomach: mild diffuse gastric mucosal bleeding. - - - Thyroid gland: bilateral nodular goiter with chocolate cysts (up to 0.5 cm in diameter). - - - Prostate gland: benign nodular prostatic hyperplasia [Figure 7](#vaccines-10-01651-f007)). Furthermore, spike could be demonstrated in the areas of lymphocytic periarteritis, present in the thoracic and abdominal aorta and iliac branches, as well as cerebral basal artery ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-10-01651-f008)). The SARS-CoV-2 subunit 1 was found in macrophages and in the cells of the vessel wall, in particular the endothelium ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-10-01651-f009)), as well as in [Figure 10](#vaccines-10-01651-f010)). In contrast, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in any of the corresponding tissue sections ( [Figure 11](#vaccines-10-01651-f011)and [Figure 12](#vaccines-10-01651-f012)). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 1 was detected in the lymphocytic myocarditis 3.4. Autopsy-Based Diagnosis 4. Discussion [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01651), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01651)]. However, the detailed autopsy study revealed additional pathology, in particular necrotizing encephalitis and myocarditis. While the histopathological signs of myocarditis were comparatively mild, the encephalitis had resulted in significant multifocal necrosis and may well have contributed to the fatal outcome. Encephalitis often causes epileptic seizures, and the tongue bite found at the autopsy suggests that it had done so in this case. Several other cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated encephalitis with status epilepticus have appeared previously [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01651), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01651), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01651)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01651), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01651)]. This is also the case for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, where a systemic exposure to the virus and its spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role, leading to vascular dysfunction, immune-thrombosis, and inflammation [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01651)]. [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01651)]. In histology, however, this immunohistochemical approach has not yet been described, but it is straightforward and appears to be very useful for identifying the potential origin of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in autopsy or biopsy samples. Where additional confirmation is required, for instance in a forensic context, rt-PCR methods might be used to ascertain the presence of the vaccine mRNA in the affected the mRNA-COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 also showed that the vaccine does not stay at the injection site but is distributed to all tissues and organs, including the brain [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01651)]. After the worldwide roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations in humans, spike protein has been detected in humans as well in several tissues distant from the injection site (deltoid muscle): for instance in heart muscle biopsies from myocarditis patients [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01651)], within the skeletal muscle of a patient with myositis [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01651)] and within the skin, where it was associated with a sudden onset of Herpes zoster lesions after mRNA-COVID-19 vaccination [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01651)]. [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01651), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01651)]. Autoimmune diseases in organs other than the CNS have been reported as well, for example, a striking case of a patient who after mRNA vaccination suffered multiple autoimmune disorders all at once\u2014acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, and thyroiditis [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01651)]. In the case reported here, it may be noted that the spike protein was primarily detected in the vascular endothelium and sparsely in the glial cells but not in the neurons. Nevertheless, neuronal cell death was widespread in the encephalitic foci, which suggests some contribution of immunological bystander activation, i.e., autoimmunity, to the observed cell and tissue damage. [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01651), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01651)]. PD seems well to be significantly associated with increased left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction [ [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01651)]. In the current case, ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy were present but seem rather related to manifest signs of chronic hypertension. In contrast, myocardial inflammatory reactions had been well-linked to gene-based COVID-19 vaccinations in numerous cases [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01651), [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01651), [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01651), [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01651)]. In one case, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 could also be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the heart of vaccinated individuals [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01651)]. 5. Conclusions [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01651), [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01651), [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01651)]. However, this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein within the encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection. These findings corroborate a causative role of the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines, and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well.
