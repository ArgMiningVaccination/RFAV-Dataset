Since its founding in 1916, the Bloomberg School has advanced research, education and practice to create solutions to public health problems around the world. Faculty, staff and students have helped eradicate smallpox, made water safe to drink, improved child survival, reduced the spread of HIV and uncovered the dangers of tobacco smoke. Researchers and scientists are now discovering ways to eliminate malaria, increase healthy behavior, reduce the toll of chronic disease, improve the health of mothers and infants, and change the biology of aging. Every day, the Bloomberg School works to keep millions around the world safe from illness and injury by pioneering new research, deploying knowledge in the field and educating tomorrow's public health leaders.

[Faculty](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/list/) and Reproductive Health](/public-health/departments/population-family-reproductive-health/) Accreditation Every seven years, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is evaluated by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), the independent accrediting agency for U.S. Schools of Public Health. As part of this evaluation, the school constructs a self-study that comprehensively describes the school's organization, governance, resources, faculty, students, curriculum, research, and services. The self-study is reviewed by an external committee who visits the school and meets with a variety of stakeholders including faculty, students, staff, alumni, and external community representatives. This committee makes a recommendation to the CEPH Board on whether the school should continue to be accredited. In 2015, the CEPH Board voted to renew the accreditation of the School for another seven year term, ending in 2022. This has since been extended to December 2023. The School will conduct a self-study in 2022 and a CEPH accreditation site visit will be conducted before December 2023. Our thanks are extended to Stephen Gange, James Yager, Karen Charron and Yelizaveta Kalashnikova-Luby for their dedication and hard work during the 2015 re-accreditation process. The final self-study and accreditation reports are available upon request by email at [academicaffairs@jhu.edu](mailto:academicaffairs@jhu.edu).

Design projects are required. Area: Engineering, Quantitative and Mathematical Sciences In this interdisciplinary seminar class, we will discuss past, present, and future climate change. We will do so through several case studies on California; Eastern California is a hub of research on past climate change, and arguably few states are being more heavily impacted by current climate change than California. Throughout the first half of the course, we will learn how climate has changed in the past, the magnitude of those changes, the possible causes, and the physical and ecological impacts of past climate change. In the second half of the course, we will contrast past climate change with the impacts and severity of contemporary climate change. We will explore how climate change is stressing water resources, air quality, and ecological resilience across California, and we will critically evaluate how the state's recent policy initiatives are ameliorating (or exacerbating) these stresses. The course will include a week-long spring break field trip to Eastern California where we will explore how climate change is stressing water resources, air quality, and ecological resilience across the state. Do not hesitate to email the instructor (smill191@jhu.edu) for more information about the field trip.

We introduce principles of engineering economics and microeconomics (demand and production theory) and their uses in engineering decision making. Area: Quantitative and Mathematical Sciences, Social and Behavioral Sciences Sustainably managing aquatic environments for ecosystem and public health in a changing climate requires us to understand the combined effect of multiple physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Prerequisite(s): [EN.570.303](/search/?P=EN.570.303) Area: Engineering, Natural Sciences This course explores the concepts, assessment, and control of exposure to biological, physical and chemical hazards in the environment, the risk of adverse health outcomes resulting from such exposures, and the relationship between the exposures and health outcomes. These are placed in the context of the multi-disciplinary scientific field of environmental health as an essential component of the wider field of public health. The course is comprised of lectures, examples, group discussions, and group presentations. The proposed course will fill a gap in content and skill development in the issues and techniques relating to human health risk assessment. This course is targeted toward undergraduates who may not have had any exposure to environmental health science, and provides an introduction to environmental health using the framework of health risk assessment. The course first introduces the concepts of exposure to environmental hazards and biological dose, routes of exposure, statistical characterization of exposure variability in populations, and monitoring networks. The next set of concepts relate to hazard characterization, i.e., adverse health outcomes resulting from such exposures using a variety of types of data including in vitro and in vivo studies, and human epidemiological studies and their strengths and weaknesses. The next segment will deal with the quantitative characterization of the relationship between exposure/dose and the adverse health outcomes, i.e., the dose-response relationships, the metrics used for this, and quantitatively characterizing the health risks of a population. The course will introduce students to several tools including mathematical modeling of exposures and risk, and uncertainty analysis.

Advancing a transition toward sustainability hinges on applying what we know to what we should do, including undergirding public policies with knowledge\u2014especially knowledge gleaned from science, technology, and engineering. This course examines sustainability science, communications, and public policy through the lens of climate\u2014what is known about climate change and impacts, what motivates public understanding, and what actions through mitigation and adaptation make progress toward sustainability. Environmental history explores the interactions between social change and environmental transformation, or the ways in which societies modify landscapes and are themselves affected by geological, climatological and changing ecological conditions. Topics include the relationship between climate change and human evolution, the environmental impacts of market-based commodity production and regional economic specialization; the relationship between urbanization and environmental change; how warfare affects and is affected by environmental conditions. Area: Humanities, Social and Behavioral Sciences Writing Intensive The purpose of this class is to understand the landscape-scale controls on the fluxes of water and waterborne materials through watersheds. This class differs from the Hydrology and Hydrologic Modeling classes in its focus on data analysis, and its embrace of the complexity of real landscapes. There will be significant quantitative components to the material taught, but emphasis will be on developing a greater sense of the way that landscapes \"function\", and how this function is related to real-world issues of water resources and pollution. Students will gain an understanding of how climate, geologic and ecologic setting, and human impacts control the partitioning of water between different fates, the flowpaths through the landscape and the storage and residence time of water. They will also learn conceptual and practical tools for analyzing hydrologic and other landscape data, and integrating this data in a holistic approach to watershed analysis. The class will be of interest for students intending to go into watershed or landscape management, and anyone wishing to pursue research in hydrology, geomorphology or ecology at landscape and watershed scales.
