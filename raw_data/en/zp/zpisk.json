The quadrivalent vaccines are designed to protect against four different flu viruses, including two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses, and the high-dose vaccine is designed to help older adults have a stronger immune system response, according to Carter. Walk-ins accepted or appointments scheduled (call 770-382-1920) during these hours: Mon.-Wed.-Thurs. - 8 am to 4 pm Tues. - 8 am to 5:30 am Fri. - 8 am to 1 pm \"Getting a flu vaccine is the single best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against influenza,\" Carter emphasizes. Carter also reminds us that the health department will soon offer protection against two other common respiratory illnesses. \"Sometime in September, we'll have a new Covid vaccine available at the health department, which will help provide protection against the new EG.5 variant, now the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S. Later this fall, we'll also be offering new R.S.V. (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccines for older adults and pregnant women, and, for infants, an antibody therapy, which is not a vaccine, to help protect against this common respiratory virus. We'll make information about these available as soon as possible.\" ### About the Bartow County Health Department: The Bartow County Health Department works to prevent disease, injury, and disability; promote health, safety, and wellbeing; and prepare for and respond to disasters, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals and families in Bartow County.
