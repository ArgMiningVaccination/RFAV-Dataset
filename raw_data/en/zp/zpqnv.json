But as Scott Rozelle and Natalie Hell show in Invisible China , the truth is much more complicated and might be a serious cause for concern. China's growth has relied heavily on unskilled labor. Most of the workers who have fueled the country's rise come from rural villages and have never been to high school. While this national growth strategy has been effective for three decades, the unskilled wage rate is nally rising, inducing companies inside China to automate at an unprecedented rate and triggering an exodus of companies seeking cheaper labor in other countries. Ten years ago, almost every product for sale in an American Walmart was made in China. Today, that is no longer the case. With the changing demand for labor, China seems to have no good back-up plan. For all of its investment in physical in-frastructure, for decades China failed to invest enough in its people. Recent progress may come too late. Drawing on extensive surveys on the ground in China, Rozelle and Hell reveal that while China may be the second-largest economy in the world, its labor force has one of the lowest levels of education of any comparable country. This may leave many unable to nd work in the formal workplace as China's economy changes and manufacturing jobs move elsewhere. In Invisible China , Rozelle and Hell speak not only to an urgent humanitarian concern but also a potential economic crisis that could upend economies and foreign relations around the globe. This book is an urgent and timely call to action that should be read by economists, policymakers, the business comm unity, and general readers alike. Scott Rozelle is a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and holds the Helen F. Farnsworth Endowed Professorship at Stanford University. Rozelle codirects the Rural Education Action Program (REAP) and is a faculty afliate at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. Natalie Hell is a writer and researcher. As part of REAP, she has worked on Chinese education and health issues for the past seven years. \"No one knows rural China better than Rozelle. In this brilliant, original, thought-provoking, and important study, Rozelle and Hell not only make China's potential human capital crisis visible, but provide actionable solutions based on rigorous research.\"\u2014Hongbin Li, James Liang Director of the China Program, Stanford University OCTOBER 248 p. 5 figures, 2 taEles 6 x Genesis Quest The Geniuses and Eccentrics on a Journey to Uncover the Origin of Life on Earth How did life begin? Why are we here? These are some of the most profound questions we can ask. For almost a century, a small band of eccentric scientists has struggled to answer these questions and explain one of the greatest mysteries of all: how and why life began on Earth. There are many different proposals, and each idea has attracted pas - sionate believers who promote it with an almost religious fervor, as well as detractors who reject it with equal zeal. But the quest to unravel life's genesis is not just a story of big ideas. It is also a compelling human story, rich in personalities, conflicts, and surprising twists and turns. Along the way the journey takes in some of the greatest discoveries in modern biology, from evolution and cells to DNA and life's family tree. It is also a search whose end may finally be in sight. In The Genesis Quest , Michael Marshall shows how the quest to un - derstand life's beginning is also a journey to discover the true nature of life, and by extension our place in the universe. Michael Marshall is a science writer interested in life sciences and the environ - ment. He has worked as a staff journalist at New Scientist and the BBC. Since 2017 he has been a freelance writer, published by outlets including BBC Future , the Observer , Nature , New Scientist , and the Telegraph . In 2019 he was shortlisted for News Item of the Year by the Association of British Science Writers. He lives in Devon, UK, with his wife and daughter.From the introduction \"The story of the quest to understand gen - esis is a universal one, in which everyone can find pleasure and fascination. By asking how life came to be, we are im - plicitly asking why we are here, whether life exists on other planets, and what it means to be alive. This book is the story of a group of fragile, flawed humans who chose to wrestle with these questions. By exploring the origin of life, these people have caught a glimpse of the infinite.\" OCTOBER 328 p. 7 halftones, 1 table 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-0-226-71523-0 Cloth $26.00 general interest ALASTAIR BONNETT Elsewhere A Journey into Our Age of Islands There are millions of islands on our planet. New islands are being built at an unprecedented rate, for tourism and territo - rial ambition. Many are also disappearing, besieged by rising sea levels. The story of our world's islands is one of the greatest dramas of our time, and it is playing out around the entire globe\u2014islands are sprouting or being submerged everywhere from the South China Sea to the Atlantic. Elsewhere is the story of this strange and mesmerizing planetary spectacle. In this book, explorer and geographer Alastair Bonnett takes us on a thought-provoking tour of the world's most fascinating islands. He traveled the globe to provide a firsthand look at numerous islands, painting vivid snapshots of each one he visited. From a \"crannog,\" an ancient artificial island in a Scottish loch, to the militarized artificial is - lands China is building; from the disappearing islands that remain the home of native Central Americans to the ritzy new islands of Dubai; from Hong Kong to the Isles of Scilly\u2014all have compelling stories to tell. As we journey around the world with Bonnett, he addresses urgent contemporary issues such as climate change, economic inequality, and the changing balance of world power as reflected in the fates of islands. Along the way, we also learn about the many ways islands rise and fall, the long and little-known history of human island building, and the prospect that the hills and valleys of today's continental lands will one day be a series of archipelagos. Featuring Bonnett's charming hand-drawn maps and thirty-three full-color photos, Elsewhere is a captivating travel book for any armchair adventurer.

Henri Matisse was one of the great- est artists to work in this genre, and he created his most important works during a period of intense personal and physical suf- fering. Brimming with powerful themes and imagery, these works are crucial to understanding Matisse's oeuvre. With deftness and sensitivity, Louise Rogers Lalaurie reintroduces us to Matisse by considering how in each volume, Matisse constructed an intriguing dialogue between word and image. Examining this page- by-page interplay, translating key sequences, and discussing the books' distinct themes and production histories, Lalaurie offers the thought- ful analysis these works deserve. Together Matisse's artist books reveal his deep engagement with questions of beauty and truth; his faith; his perspectives on aging, loss, and inspiration; and his relationship to his critics, the French art establishment, and the women in his life. In addition, Lalaurie illuminates Matisse's often misunderstood political af nities\u2014 though Matisse was vili ed in his time for choosing to live in the collabo- rationist Vichy zone, Matisse's wartime books reveal a body of work that stands as a deeply per- sonal statement of resistance.

The pas-sivity of the experience frustrates him; like the cowboy's victim, he feels he has been ensnared or caught off guard. Again, words and pictures combine to gener-ate meaning - here, an intimate evocation of Matisse's ambivalent, very physical sense of his own stance vis-\u00e0-vis a controlling deity. The next picture presents another double-act: Le lanceur de couteaux ('The knife thrower'). Black and azure fronds float against a white ground. A tall silhouette of a woman, in pale mauve streaked with deeper blue, stands with her head and raised arms reaching off the page, her body an echo of the earlier armless, headless Forms. A deep magenta form directs a blade at a black square containing a cut-away frond, placed over the woman's heart. As with the cowboy, we see one passive figure confronted by the mysterious - godlike? - skill and showmanship of another. But the knife thrower, the last of the book's sequence of circus acts, effects a change: unlike the choked sword swallower or the cowboy's toppling victim, his target has acquired agency. She is poised and calm. The aggressor has evolved, too. Contained by vertical strips of beige and pale blue, he does not encroach into his target's space, seeming almost to writhe in impotent frustration. The woman is the focal point of Jazz's transition from the emotional and physical violence of the earlier sections to the serene joy of the closing pages. Surrounded and overlaid by floating fronds, she resembles an amphora lying at the bottom of a lagoon.This remarkable image is the culmination of a series of statements articu- lated in words and pictures, in which Matisse exposes the heart of his 'existence as a painter': the origins of his curvaceous formal vocabulary, his quest for authentic emotional expression, the interplay of acquired, practised skill, instinct and spon-taneity and the vital importance of humility and receptiveness to the mystery of inspiration - God-given or otherwise. The artist's relationship to his models and critics is one vital aspect unstated in the text, but clearly addressed in the pictures. We may remember the impassive nymph reclining while the Faun humps her leg in the Po\u00e9sies, or Europa taking the bull by the horns to haunt the artist's dreams in the Floril\u00e8ge. In Le lanceur de couteaux, the model stands inviolate, even vic- torious, depicted with skill, humility and, as we discover at the turn of the page, love - not sexual passion, but simple, uncomplicated acceptance. The book's final sections jettison the pain, jeopardy, coercion and control that have gone before, and instead express a resounding personal and artistic creed. Addressing 'young painters, misunderstood painters, painters comprehended late in their careers', advises 'pas de Haine' ('have no hatred') because 'hatred is a parasite that devours all.' Love is the only constructive emotion. Emulation is necessary, but love is the artist's true foundation. The next four pages of script are devoted to an extract from the Imitation of Christ, a fifteenth-century spiri- tual handbook widely attributed to the pp. 106-7JESSICA MAIER The Eternal City A History of Rome in Maps One of the most visited places in the world, Rome attracts mil - lions of tourists each year to walk its storied streets and see famous sites like the Colosseum, St. Peter's Basilica, and the Trevi Fountain. Yet this ancient city's allure is due as much to its rich, unbroken history as to its extraordinary array of landmarks. Countless incarnations and eras merge in the Roman cityscape. With a history spanning nearly three millennia, no other place can quite match the resilience and reinventions of the aptly nicknamed Eternal City. In this unique and visually engaging book, Jessica Maier considers Rome through the eyes of mapmakers and artists who have managed to capture something of its essence over the centuries. Viewing the city as not one but ten \"Romes,\" she explores how the varying maps and art reflect each era's key themes. Ranging from modest to magnicent, the images comprise singular aesthetic monuments like paintings and grand prints as well as more popular and practical items like mass-produced tourist plans, archaeological surveys, and digitizations. The most iconic and important images of the city appear alongside relatively obscure, unassuming items that have just as much to teach us about Rome's past. Through full-color images and thoughtful overviews of each era, Maier provides an accessible, comprehensive look at Rome's many overlapping layers of history in this landmark volume. The rst book ever published in English to tell Rome's rich story through its maps, The Eternal City beautifully captures the past, present, and future of one of the most famous and enduring places on the planet.

It illustrates the story of his ca-reer, from apprentice to surveyor for hire and fossil collector, from his 1799 geological map of Bath and table of strata to his groundbreaking 1815 geological strata map, and from his imprisonment for debt to his creation of detailed stratigraphical county maps. This sumptuous volume begins with an introduction by Douglas Palmer that places Smith's work in the context of earlier, concurrent, and subsequent ideas regarding the structure and natural processes of the earth, geographical mapping, and biostratigraphical theories. The book is then organized into four parts, each beginning with four sheets from Smith's hand-colored, 1815 strata map, accompanied by related geological cross-sections and county maps, and followed by fossil illustrations by Smith contemporary James Sowerby, all orga-nized by strata. Strata concludes with refl ections on Smith's later years as an itinerant geologist and surveyor, his experience of plagiarism by a rival, his receipt of the rst Wollaston Medal in recognition of his achievements, and the infl uence of his geological mapping and biostratigraphical theories on the sciences\u2014all of which culminated in the establishment of the modern geological timescale. Featuring a foreword by Robert Macfarlane, Strata is a glorious testament to the lasting geological and illustrative genius of William Smith. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History holds an unrivaled William Smith collection, including not only his 1815 map and unpublished county maps, but also his vast archive of diaries, letters, published works, charts, and plans.

More than that, it was the single largest organiza-tion in Western antiquity, taking in members from all classes, from senators to freed slaves. The Roman Empire depended on its army not just to win its wars, defend its frontiers, and control the seas, but to act as the very engine of the state. In Gladius , Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re takes us straight to the heart of what it meant to be a part of the Roman army. Rather than a history of the army itself, or a guide to military organization and ghting meth-ods, this book is a ground-level re-creation of what it was like to be a soldier in the army that made the empire. Surveying numerous aspects of life in the Roman army between 31 BCE and 337 CE, Gladius \u2014the Latin word for sword\u2014draws on not only on the words of famed Ro- man historians, but also those of the soldiers themselves, as recorded in their religious dedications, tombstones, and even private letters and grafti. B\u00e9doy\u00e8re reveals the everyday life of these soldiers and their families, whether stationed in a bleak frontier garrison in England or North Africa, tasked with guarding the emperor in Rome, ghting on foreign battleelds, mutinying over pay, marching in triumph, throw-ing their weight around on city streets, or enjoying esteem in honor-able retirement. By illuminating the history of one organization that reflected all corners of the Roman world, Gladius gives us a portrait of an ancient society that is unprecedented in its broad sweep and gritty intimacy. Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re is the author of many books about the Roman world and was a longtime cohost of BBC Channel 4's Time Team .\"The Roman army has been a source of endless fascination ever since antiquity. No other military force has lasted so long or achieved so much. The focus in Gladius is always on the individual soldier as much as possible, real people whose per-sonal experience of the Roman army has reached us through a variety of routes. The information comes from Roman his - torians, inscriptions set up by the units, ofcial documents, and from the soldiers themselves or their families on their tombstones, religious dedications or even personal letters. Taken together they paint a remarkable picture of the largest organization in western antiquity, without which the Roman Empire could not have existed.\"\u2014from the Introduction 129(0%(5 352 p. 16 halItones, 4 +,6725< OBE/EU 8 general interest JEREMY BLACK A History of the Second World War in 100 Maps The First World War was marked by an exceptional expansion in the use and production of military cartography. But World War II took things even further, employing maps, charts, reconnaissance, and the systematic recording and processing of geo-graphical and topographical information on an unprecedented scale. As Jeremy Black\u2014one of the world's leading military and cartographic historians\u2014convincingly shows in this lavish full-color book, it is im-possible to understand the events and outcomes of the Second World War without deep reference to mapping at all levels. A History of the Second World War in 100 Maps traces how military cartography developed from simply recording and reflecting history to having a decisive impact on events of a global scale. Drawing on one hundred key maps from the unparalleled collections of the British Library and other sources\u2014many of which have never been published in book form before\u2014Jeremy Black takes us from the prewar mapping programs undertaken by both Germany and the United Kingdom in the mid-1930s through the conflict's end a decade later. Black shows how the development of maps led directly to the planning of the com-plex and fluid maneuvers that dened the European theater in World War II: for example, aerial reconnaissance photography allowed for the charting of beach gradients and ocean depths in the run-up to the D-Day landings, and the subsequent troop movements at Normandy would have been impossible without the help of situation maps and photos. In the course of the conflict, in both Europe and the Pacic, the realities of climate, terrain, and logistics\u2014recorded on maps\u2014overcame the Axis powers. In this thrilling and unique book, Jeremy Black applies his singu- lar cartographic and military expertise to create a captivating overview of World War II from the air, sea, and sky, making clear how funda-mental maps were to every aspect of this unforgettable global conflict.

Over its three million years of existence, the human species has continuously modied nature and drained its resources. In Cataclysms , Laurent Testot provides the full tally, offering a compre- hensive environmental history of humanity's unmatched and perhaps irreversible influence on the world. Testot explores the interconnected histories of human evolution and planetary deterioration, arguing that our development from na-ked apes to Homo sapiens has entailed wide-scale environmental harm. Testot makes the case that humans have usually been catastrophic for the planet, \"hyperpredators\" responsible for mass extinctions, defores-tation, global warming, ocean acidication, and unchecked pollution, as well as the slaughter of our own species. Organized chronologically around seven technological revolutions, Cataclysms unspools the inter- twined saga of humanity and our environment, from our shy begin-nings in Africa to today's domination of the planet, revealing how we have blown past any limits along the way\u2014whether by exploding our own population numbers, domesticating countless other species, or harnessing energy from fossils. Testot's book, while sweeping, is light and approachable, telling the stories\u2014sometimes rambunctious, sometimes appalling\u2014of how a gloried monkey transformed its own environment beyond all recognition. In order to begin reversing our environmental disaster, we must have a better understanding of our own past and the incalculable envi-ronmental costs incurred at every stage of human innovation. Cata - clysms offers that understanding and the hope that we can now begin to reform our relationship to the earth. Laurent Testot is a French journalist and lecturer who specializes in global history. His books include Homo Canis and The New World History . Katharine Throssell is a professional translator. \"Testot's Cataclysms: An Environmental History of Humanity is a global and histor - ical tour de force of humans facing nature; from the earliest of times to our present days. Testot's book demonstrates that we still are monkeys; basically seeking the tribal pleasures of a warm pool. Yes, the human monkey has conquered the world, dominated nature, and transformed the Earth. But that's it. Nothing more. Thus, in 2020, this monkey world is as vulner-able as ever in its struggle to cope with a single, tiny virus\u2014COVID-19.

Not so. It is merely the latest in a long series of drug crises stretching back over a century. In White Market Drugs, David Herzberg explores these crises and the drugs that fueled them. As Herzberg argues, the vast majority of American experiences with drugs and addiction have taken place within what he calls \"white markets,\" where the prescription of addictive drugs is legal and medi-cally approved. These markets are widely acknowledged, but no one has explained how they became so central to the medical system in a nation famous for its \"drug wars\"\u2014until now. Drawing from federal, state, industry, and medical archives alongside a wealth of published sources, Herzberg re-connects America's divided drug history, telling the whole story for the rst time. He reveals that the driving question for policymakers has never been how to prohibit the use of addictive drugs, but how to ensure their availability in medical contexts, where protability often outweighs public safety. Access to white markets was thus a double-edged sword for socially privileged consumers, even as communities of color faced exclusion and punitive drug prohibition. To counter this no-win setup, Herzberg advocates for a consumer protection approach that robustly regulates all drug markets while caring for people with addiction by ensuring them safe, reliable access to medication-assisted treatment. Accomplishing this requires rethinking a drug/medicine divide born a century ago that, which, unlike most policies of that racially segregated era, has somehow survived relatively unscathed into the twenty-rst century. By showing how the twenty-rst-century opioid crisis is only the most recent in a long history of similar crises of addiction to pharma-ceuticals, Herzberg forces us to rethink our most basic ideas about drug policy and addiction itself\u2014ideas that have been failing us cata-strophically for over a century. David Herzberg is associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo. He is the author of Happy Pills in America: From Miltown to Prozac . \"White Market Drugs provides essential backstory for a string of Pharma-stoked drug crises.

MOE Presidents, Populism, and the Crisis of Democracy Has American democracy's long, ambitious run come to an end? Possibly yes. As William G. Howell and Terry M. Moe argue in this trenchant new analysis of modern politics, the United States faces a historic crisis that threatens our system of self-government\u2014and if democracy is to be saved, the causes of the crisis must be understood and defused. The most visible cause is Donald Trump, who has used his presi- dency to attack the nation's institutions and violate its democratic norms. Yet Trump is but a symptom of causes that run much deeper: social forces like globalization, automation, and immigration that for decades have generated economic harms and cultural anxieties that our government has been wholly ineffective at addressing. Millions of Americans have grown angry and disaffected, and populist appeals have found a receptive audience. These are the drivers of Trump's dangerous presidency. And after he leaves ofce, they will still be there for other populists to weaponize. What can be done to safeguard American democracy? The disrup- tive forces of modernity cannot be stopped. The solution lies, instead, in having a government that can deal with them\u2014which calls for ag-gressive new policies, but also for institutional reforms that enhance its capacity for effective action. The path to progress is lled with political obstacles, including an increasingly populist, anti-government Republican Party. It is hard to be optimistic. But if the challenge is to be met, we need above all for reforms of the presidency itself\u2014reforms that harness the promise of presidential power for effective government, but rmly protect against the fear that it may be put to anti-democratic ends.

Its massive volumes, The Bourgeois Virtues, Bourgeois Dignity, and Bourgeois Equality, solve Adam Smith's puzzle of the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, and of the moral sentiments of moder-nity. The world got rich, she argues, not chiefly by material causes but by an idea and a sentiment, a new admiration for the middle class and its egalitarian liberalism. For readers looking for a distillation of McCloskey's magisterial work, Leave Me Alone and I'll Make You Rich is what you've been waiting for. In this lively volume, McCloskey and the economist and journalist Art Carden bring together the trilogy's key ideas and its most provoca-tive arguments. The rise of the West, and now the rest, is the story of the rise of ordinary people to a dignity and liberty inspiring them to have a go. Leave Me Alone and I'll Make You Rich draws in entertaining fashion on history, economics, literature, philosophy, and popular culture, from growth theory to The Simpsons . It is the perfect introduction for a broad audience to McCloskey's influential explanation of how we got rich.

Informed by the convic-tion that humanistic thinking has relevance for everyday life, the magazine has long maintained a rare space for thoughtful conversa-tion between a wide range of political views, philosophical perspec-tives, and personal experiences: its contributors include liberals and conservatives, philosophers and activists, Marxists and Catholics, New Yorkers and Midwesterners. A little more than a decade since its found-ing on the campus of the University of Chicago, it offers a unique and revelatory look at the changing face of America, one that speaks not only to the way American minds have been forced to \"open\" by a decade of trauma and transformation, but also to the challenge of re-maining open to our fellow citizens during our deeply divided present. Featuring award-winning and highly acclaimed essays from The Point 's rst ten years, The Opening of the American Mind traces the path of American intellect from the magazine's inception in 2009, when Barack Obama was ascending the steps of the White House, to the brink of the 2020 election. The essays, chosen for the way they both capture their time and transcend it, are organized into ve sections that address cycles of cultural frustrations, social movements, and the aftermath of the 2016 election, and they offer lively, forward-looking considerations of how we might expand our imaginations into the future. Spanning the era of Obama and Trump, Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and renewed attention to reparations, this anthology offers critical reflections on some of the decade's most influential events and stands as a testament to the signicance of open exchange. The intellectual dialogue provided by The Point has never been more urgently needed. The Point is a Chicago-based magazine of philosophical writing on contempo- rary life and culture. Founded by three graduate students at the University of Chicago in 2009, it has become a nationally recognized home for today's most thought-provoking essays, criticism, and intellectual journalism. Praise for The Point \"Consistently wise, provocative, intel - ligent, serious, and just. Can that be said of any other journal in America?

DOWNEY How Schools Really Matter Why Our Assumption about Schools and Inequality Is Mostly Wrong Most of us assume that public schools in America are unequal\u2014that the quality of the education varies with the location of the school and that as a result, children learn more in the schools that serve mostly rich, white kids than in the schools serving mostly poor, black kids. But it turns out that this common assumption is misplaced. As Douglas B. Downey shows in How Schools Really Matter , achievement gaps have very little to do with what goes on in our schools. Not only do schools not exacerbate in-equality in skills, they actually help to level the playing eld. The real sources of achievement gaps are elsewhere. A close look at the testing data in seasonal patterns bears this out. It turns out that achievement gaps in reading skills between high- and low-income children are nearly entirely formed prior to kindergarten, and schools do more to reduce them than increase them. And when gaps do increase, they tend to do so during summers, not during school periods. So why do both liberal and conservative politicians strongly advocate for school reform, arguing that the poor quality of schools serving disadvantaged children is an important contributor to inequal - ity? It's because discussing the broader social and economic reforms necessary for really reducing inequality has become too challenging and polarizing\u2014it's just easier to talk about xing schools. Of course, there are differences that schools can make, and Downey outlines the kinds of reforms that make sense given what we know about inequality outside of schools, including more school exposure, increased standardization, and better and fairer school and teacher measurements. How Schools Really Matter offers a rm rebuke to those who nd nothing but fault in our schools, which are doing a much better than job than we give them credit for. It should also be a call to arms for educa - tors and policymakers. Douglas B. Downey is professor of sociology at Ohio State University. \"Downey challenges the ideas that schools are engines of inequality and that schools can be effectively transformed to substantially reduce inequality. Having completed some of the most influential recent work on the topic, he shows that most of the inequalities we observe are rooted in skills children do and do not possess on their very rst day of school, and the evidence suggests that for the most part, schools keep differences from getting bigger. Schools can only get you part of the way if you want to have a more equal opportunity structure for kids. If equality of opportunity is your goal, then you have to invest more heavily in solutions outside rather than inside of schools.\"\u2014Eric Grodsky, University of Wisconsin-Madison OCTOBER 176 p. 12 figures 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 ISBN-13: 978-0-226-73319-7 Cloth 15Edited by DOUGLAS W.

M ACNULTY Yellowstone Wolves Science and Discovery in the World's First National Park With a Foreword by Jane Goodall In 2020, it will have been twenty-ve years since one of the great- est wildlife conservation and restoration achievements of the twentieth century took place: the reintroduction of wolves to the world's rst national park, Yellowstone. Eradicated after the park was established, then absent for seventy years, these iconic carnivores returned to Yellowstone in 1995 when the US government reversed its century-old policy of extermination and\u2014despite some political and cultural opposition\u2014began the reintroduction of forty-one wild wolves from Canada and northwest Montana. Here, for the rst time in a single book, is the incredible story of the wolves' return to Yel-lowstone National Park as told by the very people responsible for their reintroduction, study, and management. We learn about individual wolves, population dynamics, wolf-prey relationships, genetics, disease, management and policy, newly studied behaviors and interactions with other species, and the rippling ecosystem effects wolves have had on Yellowstone's wild and rare landscape. Perhaps most importantly of all, the book also offers solutions to ongoing controversies and debates. Featuring a foreword by Jane Goodall, beautiful images, a com- panion online documentary by celebrated lmmaker Bob Landis, and contributions from more than seventy wolf and wildlife conservation luminaries from Yellowstone and around the world, Yellowstone Wolves is a gripping, accessible celebration of the extraordinary Yellowstone Wolf Project\u2014and of the park through which these majestic and im-portant creatures once again roam. Douglas W. Smith has studied wolves for more than forty years. In 1994 he was hired by the National Park Service in Yellowstone National Park as the project biologist to reintroduce wolves, and in 1997 he became the project leader, a position he still holds today. Daniel R. Stahler is the Yellowstone Wolf Project's lead biologist and the project leader of the Yellowstone Cougar Project. Daniel R. MacNulty is associate professor of wildlife ecology in the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University and was one of the rst volun-teers hired by the Yellowstone Wolf Project. With L. David Mech, Smith and MacNulty are coauthors of Wolves on the Hunt: The Behavior of Wolves Hunting Wild Prey, also published by the University of Chicago Press.From the foreword \"Yellowstone Wolves summarizes over two decades of hard work, involving dozens of dedicated scientists and advocates, to bring these wolves back to Yellowstone. . . . Their voices are skillfully combined to tell the many-faceted narratives in this marvelous book. . . .

Confronted with the immensity of these challenges and of the oceans themselves, we might wonder what more can be done to stop their decline and better protect the sea and marine life. Such widespread environmental threats call for a simple but signicant shift in reasoning to bring about long-overdue, elemental change in the way we use ocean resources. In Future Sea , ocean advocate and marine- policy researcher Deborah Rowan Wright provides the tools for that shift. Questioning the underlying philosophy of established ocean conservation approaches, Rowan Wright lays out a radical alternative: a bold and far-reaching strategy of 100 percent ocean protection that would put an end to destructive industrial activities, better safeguard marine biodiversity, and enable ocean wildlife to return and thrive along coasts and in seas around the globe. Future Sea is essentially concerned with the solutions and not the problems. Rowan Wright shines a light on existing international laws intended to keep marine environments safe that could underpin this new strategy. She gathers inspiring stories of communities and coun-tries using ocean resources wisely, as well as of successful conservation projects, to build up a cautiously optimistic picture of the future for our oceans\u2014counteracting all too prevalent reports of doom and gloom. A passionate, sweeping, and personal account, Future Sea not only argues for systemic change in how we manage what we do in the sea, but also describes steps that anyone, from children to political leaders (or indeed, any reader of the book), can take toward safe-guarding the oceans and their extraordinary wildlife. Deborah Rowan Wright is an independent researcher who writes about marine conservation. She has worked with the UK NGOs Whale & Dolphin Conser-vation, Friends of the Earth, and Marinet. Her work on marine renewable energy, ocean governance reform, and public-trust law has been published by the International Whaling Commission and the Ecologist , among others. In 2010, her policy document The Ocean Planet formed an integral part of Mari- net's Common Fisheries Policy reform campaign, and it won her Friends of the Earth's Communication of the Year Award.\"Rowan Wright's book is a clear call to action to modernize the Law of the Sea so that it can deal with the changes in society, in the sea, on land, and in the atmosphere that have arisen since it came into force in 1994. This is the freshest, most sensible, and most optimistic per - spective I have seen in a long time. I enjoy very much the positive, can-do approach.

BROWN Hope and Scorn Eggheads, Experts, and Elites in American Politics Intellectuals \"have been both rallying points and railed against in American politics, vessels of hope and targets of scorn,\" writes Michael J. Brown as he invigorates a recurrent debate in Ameri- can life: are intellectual public gures essential voices of knowledge and wisdom, or out-of-touch elites? Hope and Scorn investigates the role of high-prole experts and thinkers in American life and their ever-fluctuating relationship with the political and public spheres. From Eisenhower's era to Obama's, the intellectual's role in mod- ern democracy has been up for debate. What makes an intellectual, and who can claim that privileged title? What are intellectuals' obliga-tions to society, and how, if at all, are their contributions compatible with democracy? For some, intellectuals were models of civic engage-ment. For others, the rise of the intellectual signaled the fall of the citizen. Carrying us through six key moments in this debate, Brown expertly untangles the shifting anxieties and aspirations for democracy in America in the second half of the twentieth century and beyond. Hope and Scorn begins with \"egghead\" politicians like Adlai Stevenson; proles scholars like Richard Hofstadter and scholars-turned-politicians like H. Stuart Hughes; and ends with the rise of a new class of public intellectual typied by bell hooks and Cornel West. In clear and unburdened prose, Brown explicates issues of power, authority, political backlash, and more. Hope and Scorn is an essential guide to American concerns about intellectuals, their myriad shortcomings, and their formidable abilities. Michael J. Brown is assistant professor of history at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\"This book will change the terms in which historians have thought about the mean - ing of intellectual life in the second half of the twentieth century . . . .

Feminisms A Global History Though feminism's origins have often been framed around a limited cast of mostly white and educated foremothers, the truth is that feminism has been and continues to be a global movement. For centuries, women from all walks of life have been mobilizing for gender justice. As the last decade has reminded even the most powerful women, there is nothing \"post-feminist\" about our world. And there is much to be learned from the passion and protests of the past. Historian Lucy Delap looks to the global past to give us a usable history of the movement against gender injustice\u2014one that can help clarify questions of feminist strategy, priority, and focus in the contem-porary moment. Rooted in recent innovative histories, Feminisms incor - porates alternative starting points and new thinkers, challenging the presumed priority of European feminists and ranging across a global terrain of revolutions, religions, empires, and anti-colonial struggles. In Feminisms , we nd familiar stories\u2014of suffrage, of solidarity, of protest\u2014yet there is no assumption that feminism looks the same in each place or time. Instead, Delap explores a central paradox: the ght for gender equality has taken place under unequal conditions, where some voices are heard and others are routinely muted. In amplifying the voices of gures at the grassroots level, Delap shows us how a rich relationship to the feminist past can help inform its future.

She is the author of The Feminist Avant-Garde: Transatlantic Encounters of the Early Twentieth Century and Knowing Their Place: Domestic Service in Twentieth-Century Britain .\"Delap provides a concise but thorough history of the variety of feminist move- ments that have formed over the last century, bringing a sense of shared vision and voice to a diverse history without forcing a false unity.\"\u2014Carla Jones, University of Colorado, Boulder OCTOBER 256 p. 20 halItones 6 x from Chicago's LGBTQ Archives The variety of gay life in Chicago is too abundant and too diverse to be contained in a single place. But since 1981, the Gerbert/Hart Library & Archives on the city's North Side has strived to do just that, amassing and cataloging a wealth of records related to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer-identied people and organizations in the city. In Queer Legacies , John D'Emilio\u2014a pioneering scholar of gay and lesbian studies\u2014digs deep into the collection at the Gerbert/Hart Library to unearth a kaleidoscopic look at the community built by gen-erations of gay men and women in Chicago. Excavated from one of the country's most important, yet overlooked, LGBTQ archives, the stories included in his book are populated by athletes, lawyers, publishers, artists, performers, and organizers, each offering their own fascinat-ing contribution to Chicago's historically vibrant scene. The breezy and enthusiastic essays that make up Queer Legacies range in focus from politics, culture, and social life to the history of institutions like Dig-nity\u2014the foremost organization for LGBTQ Catholics\u2014and the Gay Academic Union. Though the book is anchored in Chicago, many of the essays reach farther, revealing the connections to events and issues of national import. Queer Legacies illuminates how archives can be more than musty spaces far from the urgent concerns of the present day, and shows that institutions like the Gerbert/Hart are a life-giving resource for the his-torically marginalized communities they serve. This book gives readers an inclusive and personal look at fty years of a national ght for vis-ibility, recognition, and equality led by LGBTQ Americans who, quite literally, made history. In these troubled times, it will surely inspire a new generation of scholars and activists. John D'Emilio is professor emeritus of history and gender and women's studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Munich's new Musik-Fest- halle was lled to capacity on two successive evenings for the perfor-mances, which were received with rapturous applause. Representatives of many European royal houses were in attendance, along with an array of stars from the musical and literary world, including Thomas Mann and the young Arnold Schoenberg. Also in attendance were Alma Mahler, the composer's young wife, and Alma's longtime lover, the architect Walter Gropius. Knowledge of their relationship would precipitate an emotional crisis in Mahler that, compounded with his heart condition and the passing of his young daughter Maria, would lead to his premature death the next year, in 1911. In The Eighth , Stephen Johnson provides a masterful account of the symphony's far-reaching consequences and its effects on composers, conductors, and writers of the time. The Eighth looks behind the scenes at the demanding one-week rehearsal period leading up to the pre-miere\u2014something unheard of at the time\u2014and provides fascinating insight into Mahler's compositional habits, his busy life as a conduc-tor, his philosophical and literary interests, and his personal and professional relationships. Johnson expertly contextualizes Mahler's work among the prevailing attitudes and political climate of his age, considering the art, science, technology, and mass entertainment that informed the world in 1910. The Eighth is an absorbing history of a musical masterpiece and the troubled man who created it, making it essential reading for classical music lovers.

The common belief that endless economic growth, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is not only possible but actually essential for the flourishing of civilization remains a powerful policy goal and aspiration for many. In The Mismeasure of Progress , Stephen J. Macekura exposes a historical road not taken, illuminating the stories of the activists, intellectuals, and other leaders who long argued that GDP growth was not all it was cracked up to be. Beginning with the rise of the growth paradigm in the 1940s and 1950s and continuing through the present day, The Mismeasure of Progress is the rst book on the myriad thinkers who argued against growth and the conventional way progress had been measured and de-ned. For growth critics, questioning the meaning and measurement of growth was a necessary rst step to creating a more just, equal, and sustainable world. These critics argued that focusing on growth alone would not resolve social, political, and environmental problems, and they put forth alternate methods for dening and measuring human progress. In today's global political scene\u2014marked by vast inequalities of power and wealth and made even more fraught by a global climate emergency\u2014the ideas presented by these earlier critics of growth resonate more loudly than ever. Economic growth appealed to many political leaders because it allowed them to avoid addressing political trade-offs and class conflict. It sustained the ction that humans are somehow separate from nonhuman \"nature,\" ignoring the intimate and dense connections between the two. In order to create a truly just and equitable society, Macekura argues, we need a clear understanding of our collective needs beyond growth and more holistic denitions of progress that transcend economic metrics like GDP. Stephen J. Macekura is associate professor of international studies at Indiana University's Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies.\"We need to know the history of the growth critics today, as a new generation echoes many of their arguments. The situ-ation has become increasingly critical in light of the peril posed by global climate change and the increasing inequality within many countries. As we will see, the growth critics were here rst. They struggled to bring about reforms on the necessary scale, but the traces of their efforts to imagine and build a world dened by something other than growth remain with us. The quest to redene national economic aspirations and the measurement of economic life goes on.\" \u2014from the Introduction OCTOBER 320 p. 7 halItones Wild Thought A New Translation of La Pens\u00e9e sauvage Translated by Jeffrey Mehlman and John Leavitt Perhaps the most influential anthropologist of his generation, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss left a profound mark on the development of twentieth-century thought, equal to that of phenomenology and existentialism. Through a fertile mixture of insights gleaned from linguistics and from sociology and ethnology, L\u00e9vi-Strauss elaborated his theory of structural unity in culture and became the preeminent representative of structural anthropology. La Pens\u00e9e sauvage , published in French in 1962, was his crowning achievement. Ranging over phi-losophies, historical periods, and human societies, it challenged the prevailing assumption of the superiority of modern Western culture and sought to explain the unity of human intellection. Unfortunately titled The Savage Mind when it was rst published in English in 1966, the original translation nevertheless sparked a fascination with L\u00e9vi-Strauss's work among generations of Anglophone readers. Wild Thought: A New Translation of \"La Pens\u00e9e sauvage\" rekindles that spark with a fresh and accessible new translation. Including criti-cal annotations for the contemporary reader, it restores the accuracy and integrity of the book that changed the course of twentieth-century thought, making it an indispensable addition to any philosophical or anthropological library. Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1908 -2009) is the most important anthropologist of the twentieth century, a leader in structuralist thought, and one of the key gures in the history of modern thought. He held the chair of social anthropology at the Coll\u00e8ge de France between 1959 and 1982 and was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1973.

Luke Translated by Timothy Grundy Kurt Schwitters was a major protagonist in the histories of modern art and literature whose response to the contradic-tions of modern life rivals that of Marcel Duchamp in its importance for artists working today. His celebrated Merz pictures\u2014collaged and assembled from the scrap materials of popular culture and the debris of the studio, such as newspaper clippings, wood, cardboard, fabric, and paint\u2014refl ect a lifelong interest in collection, fragmentation, and abstraction, techniques he also applied to lan-guage and graphic design. As the rst anthology in English of the critical and theoretical writings of this infl uential artist, Myself and My Aims makes the case for Schwitters as one of the most creative thinkers of his generation. Including material that has never before been published, this volume presents the full range of his proli c writing on the art and attitudes of his time, joining existing translations of his children's stories, poetry, and ction to give new readers unprecedented access to his literary imagination. With an accessible introduction by Megan R. Luke and elegant English translations by Timothy Grundy, this book will prove an exceptional resource for artists, scholars, and enthusiasts of his art.

SCHRENK The Oak Park Studio of Frank Lloyd Wright Between 1898 and 1909, Frank Lloyd Wright's residen- tial studio in the idyllic Chicago suburb of Oak Park served as a nontraditional work setting as he matured into a leader in his eld and formulized his iconic design ideology. Here, architecture historian Lisa D. Schrenk breaks the myth of Wright as the lone genius and reveals new insights into his early career. With a rich narrative voice and meticulous detail, Schrenk tracks the practice's evolution: addressing how the studio t into the Chicago-area design scene; identifying the other architects working there and their contributions; and exploring how the suburban setting and the nearby presence of family influenced ofce life. Built as an addition to his 1889 shingle-style home, Wright's studio was a core site for the ideological development of the prairie house, one of the rst truly American forms of residential architecture. Schrenk documents the educational atmosphere of Wright's ofce in the context of his devel-oping design ideology, revealing three phases as he transitioned from colleague to leader. This heavily illustrated book includes a detailed discussion of the physical changes Wright made to the building and how they informed his architectural thinking and educational prac-tices. Schrenk also addresses the later transformations of the building, including into an art center in the 1930s, its restoration in the 1970s and '80s, and its current use as a historic house museum. Based on signicant archival research, including interviews with Wright's family and almost 180 images, The Oak Park Studio of Frank Lloyd Wright offers the rst comprehensive look at the early indepen- dent ofce of one of the world's most influential architects.

In Land's End , we see Mazur writing with the kind of lyric author- ity, ever-deepening emotional range, and intellectual and social scope that her readers have come to expect in her poetry. Beautifully crafted elegies meet with reflections on her own life, her family, and artists who have come and gone. In the title poem, she leads readers through a garden, where new and old growth twists together in an \"almanac of inheritances\" that conjures the rich memory of poets who have passed on. In this space of remembrance, Mazur also charges us with the responsibility of nurturing art and artists of the future, especially in the face of the disheartening absurdities of contemporary politics. Contem - plating the growth and decay so entwined in life, these poems invite us to consider both inevitable brokenness and necessary hope, writing \"My work now: to continue learning to absorb the loss / and live.\" Through tidal creeks and the weightless scenes of ukiyo-e woodcuts, in artists' studios and along the frozen Charles River, Mazur connects passionately with the world around her. Carrying with her the undeni-able presence of loss and time past, she engages deeply with the pres-ent, her historic memory informing a concern for contemporary life. Reading Land's End , we nd ourselves with the poet: as if here at land's end, here on the coast, urgent, together we'd have energies to do battle forever. As if we could rescue the guttering world. . . . Gail Mazur is the founder of the Blacksmith House poetry reading series, one of the oldest continuous series in the country.

Previous studies of Beethoven have emphasized the importance of his personal suffering and inner struggles; Kinderman instead establishes that musical tensions in works such as the Eroica , the Appassionata , and his final piano sonata in C minor reflect Beethoven's attitudes toward the political turbulence of the era. Written for the 250th anniversary of his birth, Beethoven takes stock of the composer's legacy, showing how his idealism and zeal for resistance have ensured that masterpiec - es such as the Ninth Symphony continue to inspire activists around the globe. Kinderman considers how the Fifth Symphony helped galvanize resistance to fascism, how the Sixth has energized the environmental movement, and how Beethoven's civic engagement continues to inspire in politically perilous times. Uncertain times call for ardent responses, and, as Kinderman convincingly affirms, Beethoven's music is more relevant today than ever before. William Kinderman is professor of music and the Leo M. Klein and Elaine Krown Klein Chair in Performance Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. His many books include Beethoven , The Creative Process in Music from Mozart to Kurt\u00e1g , and, most recently, Wagner's \"Parsifal .\"\"Kinderman has written a fresh and fascinating book packed with intriguing thoughts and unexpected alignments about how Beethoven's politics translated themselves into Beethoven's music.

Renowned for extravagant performances in which his Arkestra appeared in neo-Egyptian garb, the keyboardist and bandleader also espoused an interstellar cosmology that claimed the planet Saturn as his true home. In Sun Ra's Chicago , William Sites brings this visionary musician back to earth\u2014specically to the city's South Side, where from 1946 to 1961 he lived and launched his career. The postwar South Side was a hotbed of unorthodox religious and cultural activism where Afro-centric philosophies flourished, storefront prophets sold \"dream-book bibles,\" and Elijah Muhammad was building the Nation of Islam. It was also an unruly musical crossroads where styles circulated and mashed together in clubs and community dancehalls. Sun Ra drew from a vast array of locally available intellectual and musical sources\u2014from radical nationalism, revisionist Christianity, and science ction to jazz, rhythm and blues, Latin dance music and the latest pop exotica\u2014to put together a philosophy and performance style that imagined a new identity and future for African Americans. Sun Ra's Chicago contends that late twentieth-century Afrofuturism emerged from a deep, uto-pian engagement with the city\u2014and that by excavating postwar black experience from inside Sun Ra's South Side milieu we can come to see the possibilities of urban life in new ways. William Sites is associate professor in the School of Social Service Administra- tion at the University of Chicago.\"Sun Ra's self-presentation as an inter- planetary traveler from a different world can overshadow his creative and often deeply critical engagement with this one. The influence of the bandleader's cities on his creative imagination remains underex - plored, as are the implications of twenti - eth-century African American urban life for utopian expression more broadly. Sun Ra's encounter with Chicago somehow created the opportunity to imagine worlds beyond it\u2014and to share those worlds with other South Siders.\"\u2014from the Introduction Historical Studies of Urban America OCTOBER 328 p. 25 halItones 6 x 9 ISBN-13: tradeEDWARD NELSON Milton Friedman and Economic Debate in the United States, 1932-1972 Two Volumes Milton Friedman is widely recognized as one of the most influential economists of the twentieth century. Yet no pre-vious study has distilled Friedman's vast body of writings into an authoritative account of his research, his policy views, and his interventions in public debate. Edward Nelson closes that gap: Milton Friedman and Economic Debate in the United States, 1932-1972 is the den-ing narrative on the famed economist, the rst to grapple compre-hensively with Friedman's research output, economic framework, and legacy. This two-volume account provides an introduction to Friedman's role in major economic debates that took place in the United States between 1932 and 1972. The rst volume, which takes the story through 1960, covers the period in which Friedman began and developed his research on monetary policy. It traces Friedman's thinking from his pro - fessional beginnings in the 1930s as a combative young microeconomist, to his wartime years on the staff of the US Treasury, and his emergence in the postwar period as a leading proponent of monetary policy. The second volume covers the years between 1960 and 1972, including Fried - man's involvement in a number of debates on topics such as unemploy - ment, inflation, consumer protection, and the environment. As a fellow monetary economist, Nelson writes from a unique vantage point, drawing on both his own expertise in monetary analysis and his deep familiarity with Friedman's writings. Using extensive docu - mentation, the book weaves together Friedman's research contributions and his engagement in public debate, providing an unparalleled analysis of Friedman's views on the economic developments of his day. Edward Nelson is an economist in the division of monetary affairs at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"Nelson presents a new intellectual history of Friedman's massive oeuvre, tracing Friedman's work in detail and re-lating it to the issues and literature of the time. The work is highly original and the scholarship is superlative. . . .

HAMILTON and KELLY NIELSEN Broke The Racial Consequences of Underfunding Public Universities In the past, public research universities were able to provide excel- lent education to white families thanks to healthy government funding. However, that funding has all but dried up in recent decades as historically underrepresented students have gained greater access, and now less prestigious public universities face major econom-ic challenges. In Broke , Laura T. Hamilton and Kelly Nielsen examine virtually all aspects of campus life to show how the new economic order in public universities, particularly at two campuses in the renowned University of California system, affects students. For most of the twentieth cen-tury, they show, less affluent families of color paid with their taxes for wealthy white students to attend universities where their own offspring were not welcome. That changed as a subset of public research univer-sities, some quite old, opted for a \"new\" approach, making racially and economically marginalized youth the lifeblood of the university. These new universities, however, have been particularly hard hit by austerity. To survive, they've had to adapt, nding new ways to secure funding and trim costs\u2014but ultimately it's their students who pay the price, in decreased services and inadequate infrastructure. The rise of new universities is a reminder that a world-class educa- tion for all is possible. Broke shows us how far we are from that ideal and sets out a path for how we could get there. Laura T. Hamilton is professor of sociology at the University of California, Mer- ced. She is coauthor of Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality and author of Parenting to a Degree: How Family Matters for College and Beyond , also published by the University of Chicago Press. Kelly Nielsen is a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Merced.\"In a crowded eld of studies on higher education, Broke distinguishes itself by presenting a truly unique, multifaceted, and critical portrait of the 'new university' as a racial project. Hamilton and Nielsen convincingly demonstrate how processes of 'postsecondary racial neoliberalism' concentrate underrepresented students of color in the least resourced public universities. In these institutional set - tings, diversity policies and practices are shaped not by only colorblind ideology, but austerity as well.\"\u2014Michael Omi and Howard Winant, coauthors of Racial Formation in the United States -$18$5< 288 p. 7 halItones, 3 line draZings, 1 taEle trade PAMELA J. PRICKETT Believing in South Central Everyday Islam in the City of Angels The area of Los Angeles known as South Central is often over- shadowed by dismal stereotypes, problematic racial stigmas, and its status as the home to some of the city's poorest and most violent neighborhoods. Amid South Central's shifting demo-graphics and its struggles with poverty, sociologist Pamela J. Prickett takes a closer look, focusing on the members of an African American Muslim community and exploring how they help each other combat poverty, job scarcity, violence, and racial injustice. Prickett's engaging ethnography relates how believers in this long-standing religious com-munity see Islam as a way of life, a comprehensive blueprint for individ-ual and collective action, guiding how to interact with others, conduct business, strive for progress, and cultivate faith. Prickett offers deep insights into the day-to-day lived religion of the Muslims who call this community home, showing how the mosque provides a system of social support and how believers deepen their spiritual practice not in spite of, but through, conditions of poverty. Prickett breaks past the stigmas of urban poverty, revealing a complex and vibrant community by telling the stories of long-standing residents of South Central\u2014like Sister Ava, who offers food to the local un-housed people and nds the sacred in her extensive DVD collection. In addition to her portraits of everyday life among Muslims in South Central, Prickett also provides vivid and accessible descriptions of Ramadan and histories of the mosque, situates this community within the larger story of the Nation of Islam, explores gender issues, and un-packs the interaction between African American Muslims and South Asian and Arab American Muslims, revealing both the global and local signicance of this religious tradition. Pamela J. Prickett is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam and a non-resident research fellow in the Religion and Public Life Program at Rice University. \"Smart and highly original, Believing in South Central details how a small Muslim community in South Central, Los Angeles, makes meaning of their faith in the midst of a changing racial landscape and a declining community of believers. Prickett brings nuanced analysis, beautiful prose, and seamless narration together in this ethnography that will expand scholars' understanding of how African Americans practice their Islamic faith outside Arab and South Asian Muslim communities.\" \u2014Ula Y.

PEARCE Living on the Edge An American Generation's Journey through the Twentieth Century History carves its imprint on human lives for generations af- ter. When we think of the radical changes that transformed America during the twentieth century, our minds most of- ten snap to the fties and sixties: the Civil Rights Movement, changing gender roles, and new economic opportunities all point to a decisive turning point. But these were not the only changes that shaped our world, and in Living on the Edge , we learn that rapid social change and uncertainty also dened the lives of Americans born at the turn of the twentieth century. The changes they cultivated and witnessed affect our world as we understand it today. Drawing from the iconic longitudinal Berkeley Guidance Study, Living on the Edge reveals the hopes, struggles, and daily lives of the 1900 generation. Most surprising is how relevant and relatable the lives and experiences of this generation are today, despite the gap of a century. From the reorganization of marriage and family roles and relationships to strategies for adapting to a dramatically changing economy, the challenges faced by this earlier generation echo our own time. Living on the Edge offers an intimate glimpse into not just the his-tory of our country, but the feelings, dreams, and fears of a generation remarkably kindred to the present day. Richard A.

Using novel- istic techniques, Vierba explores three episodes that proved critical to the shaping and erosion of contemporary Panamanian institutions: the establishment of a penal colony on the island of Coiba in 1919; the judicial drama following the murder of President Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rem\u00f3n Cantera in 1955; and the \"disappearance\" of a radical priest in 1971. The episodes are layered in different styles and perspectives, with the narrative voices both illuminating and concealing key moments that illustrate how powerful interests control and create social and political history. Vierba blends historical sociology with novelistic narrative and extensive empirical research, drawing on Michel Foucault's ideas about the inherent and intricate connections between power, interpretation, and representation. The result is a book that redenes conventional methods of historical writing. In short, Vierba has produced a multifaceted and deeply felt novel- istic tale that reveals not only the nature of power\u2014both institutional and disciplinary\u2014but the contemporary history of a complex country over the course of a tumultuous century.

But long before this software was developed, mapmakers around the world represented time in sophisticated and nuanced ways in static maps that offer lessons for us today. In this collection, historians K\u00e4ren Wigen and Caroline Winterer bring together leading scholars to consider how mapmakers depicted time. The essays show that time has often been a major component of what we usually consider to be a spatial medium. Focusing on 500 years of mapmaking in Europe, North America, and Asia, these essays take us from the Aztecs documenting the found-ing of Tenochtitlan, to early modern Japanese reconstructing nostalgic landscapes before Western encroachments, to nineteenth-century Americans grappling with the new concept of deep time. The book also features a defense of traditional paper maps by digital mapmaker William Rankin. With one hundred color maps and illustrations, Time in Maps will draw the attention of anyone interested in cartographic history.

In this intellectual history, Gregory Jones-Katz aims to transform the broader understanding of a movement that has been frequently misunderstood, mischaracterized, and left for dead\u2014even as its principles and influence transformed literary studies and a host of other elds in the humanities. Deconstruction begins well before Jacques Derrida's initial American presentation of his deconstructive work in a famed lecture at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 and continues through several decades of theoretic growth and tumult. While much of the subsequent story re-mains focused, inevitably, on Yale University and the personalities and curriculum that came to be lumped under the \"Yale school\" umbrella, Deconstruction makes clear how crucial feminism, queer theory, and gender studies also were to the lifeblood of this mode of thought. Ulti-mately, Jones-Katz shows that deconstruction in the United States\u2014so often caricatured as a French infection\u2014was truly an American phe-nomenon, rooted in our preexisting political and intellectual tensions, that eventually came to influence unexpected corners of scholarship, politics, and culture.

It was a Trojan Horse, esteemed literary critic and scholar Ren\u00e9 Wellek warned in 1977, that would 'destroy literary studies from the inside.' 'It' was deconstruction.

Some might say none. If scientists seek to discover fundamental truths about the world, and they do so in an objective manner using well-established methods, then how could it matter who's footing the bill? History, however, suggests otherwise. In science, as elsewhere, money is power. Tracing the recent history of oceanography, Naomi Oreskes discloses dramatic changes in American ocean science since the Cold War, uncovering how and why it changed. Much of it has to do with who pays. After World War II, the US military turned to a new, uncharted theater of warfare: the deep sea. The earth sciences\u2014particularly physical oceanography and marine geophysics\u2014became essential to the US navy, who poured unprecedented money and logistical support into their study. Science on a Mission brings to light how the influx of such military funding was both enabling and constricting: it resulted in the creation of important domains of knowledge, but also signi-cant, lasting, and consequential domains of ignorance. As Oreskes delves into the role of patronage in the history of science, what emerges is a vivid portrait of how naval oversight trans-formed what we know about the sea. It is a detailed, sweeping history that illuminates the ways in which funding shapes the subject, scope, and tenor of scientic work, and it raises profound questions over the purpose and character of American science. What difference does it make who pays? The short answer is: a lot. Naomi Oreskes is professor of the history of science at Harvard University. She is the author of many books, including Merchants of Doubt and, most recently, Why Trust Science?\"This book shows why oceanography may be the vital science whose history we need to understand if we want a picture of the evolving relationships between science and the American state over the last century. With her characteristic but rare combination of philosophical and historical insight, and her sharp eye for the politics beneath the surface, Oreskes has skillfully interpreted the wide-ranging legacies of oceanography, and brought them into our understanding of scientic\u2014and political\u2014debates of the present day.\"\u2014Katharine Anderson, York University OCTOBER 744 p. 73 halItones, 17 line draZings CLEVES Unspeakable A Life beyond Sexual Morality The sexual exploitation of children by adults has a long, fraught history. Yet how cultures have reacted to it is shaped by a range of forces, beliefs, and norms, like any other social phenomenon. Changes in how Anglo-American culture has under-stood intergenerational sex can be seen with startling clarity in the life of British writer Norman Douglas (1868-1952), who was both a be-loved and popular author, a friend of luminaries like Graham Greene, Aldous Huxley, and D. H. Lawrence\u2014as well as an unrepentant and uncloseted pederast. Rachel Hope Cleves's careful study opens a window onto the social history of intergenerational sex in the nine-teenth and twentieth centuries, revealing how charisma, celebrity, and contemporary standards protected Douglas from punishment\u2014until they didn't. Unspeakable approaches Douglas as neither monster nor literary hero, but as a man who participated in an exploitative sexual subcul- ture that was tolerated in ways we may nd hard to understand. Using letters, diaries, memoirs, police records, novels, and photographs\u2014 including sources by the children Douglas encountered\u2014Cleves identi - es the cultural practices that structured pedophilic behaviors in England, Italy, and other places Douglas favored. The resulting book delineates just how approaches to adult-child sex have changed over time, even as it offers insight into how society can confront today's scandals, celebrity and otherwise. Rachel Hope Cleves is professor of history at the University of Victoria, Canada.\"Norman Douglas was a celebrity in the early twentieth century. By present standards he was a monster. During his lifetime he was considered a great man, including by many of the children who had sexual encounters with him. The people who thought him wicked often liked him for that reason.

Water has been so integral to China's culture, economy, and growth and development that it provides a window on the whole sweep of Chinese history. In The Water Kingdom, renowned writer Philip Ball opens that window to offer an epic and powerful new way of thinking about Chinese civilization. Water, Ball shows, is a key that unlocks much of Chinese culture. In The Water Kingdom , he takes us on a grand journey through China's past and present, showing how the complexity and energy of the coun-try and its history repeatedly come back to the challenges, opportuni-ties, and inspiration provided by the waterways. Drawing on stories from travelers and explorers, poets and painters, bureaucrats and activists, of whom all have been influenced by an environment shaped and permeated by water, Ball explores how the ubiquitous relationship of the Chinese people to water has made it an enduring metaphor for philosophical thought and artistic expression. From the Han emperors to Mao, the ability to manage the waters, to provide irrigation, and defend against floods was a barometer of political legitimacy, often resulting in engineering works on a gigantic scale. It's a struggle that continues today, as the strain of economic growth on water resources may be the greatest threat to China's future. The Water Kingdom offers an unusual and fascinating history, un- covering just how much of China's art, politics, and outlook has been dened by the links between humanity and nature. Philip Ball worked for over twenty years as an editor for Nature , writes regularly in the scientic and popular media, and has authored many books on the interactions of the sciences, the arts, and the wider culture.

We now realize that it's not really telling us that \"weird\" things happen out of sight, on the tiniest level, in the atomic world. Rather, we can now see that everything is quantum: our everyday world is simply what quantum becomes at the human scale. But if quantum mechanics is right, what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that don't seems obvious or right\u2014or even possible. An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape, Beyond Weird is a book about what quantum physics really means\u2014and what it doesn't. Science writer Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, acces-sible account of the quest to come to grips with the most fundamental theory of physical reality, and to explain how its counterintuitive prin-ciples underpin the world we experience. Over the past decade it has become clear that quantum physics is less a theory about particles and waves, uncertainty and fuzziness, than a theory about information and knowledge\u2014about what can be known, and how we know it. Discover-ies and experiments over the past few decades have called into ques-tion the meanings and limits of space and time, cause and effect, and, ultimately, of knowledge itself. The quantum world Ball shows us isn't a different world. It is our world, and if anything deserves to be called \"weird,\" it's us. Philip Ball is a writer, author, and broadcaster, and was formerly an editor at Nature . His writing on scientic subjects has appeared in places ranging from New Scientist to the New York Times .

JESSE BERING Suicidal Why We Kill Ourselves For much of his thirties, Jesse Bering thought he was probably going to kill himself. He was a successful psychologist and writer, with books to his name and bylines in major magazines. But none of that mattered. The impulse to take his own life remained. At times it felt all but inescapable. Bering survived. And in addition to relief, the fading of his sui- cidal thoughts brought curiosity. Where had they come from? Would they return? Is the suicidal impulse found in other animals? Or is our vulnerability to suicide a uniquely human evolutionary development? In Suicidal , Bering answers all these questions and more, taking us through the science and psychology of suicide, revealing its cognitive secrets and the subtle tricks our minds play on us when we're easy emo-tional prey. Scientic studies, personal stories, and remarkable cross-species comparisons come together to help readers critically analyze their own doomsday thoughts while gaining broad insight into a prob-lem that, tragically, will most likely touch all of us at some point in our lives. But while the subject is certainly a heavy one, Bering's touch is light. Having been through this himself, he knows that sometimes the most effective response to our darkest moments is a gentle humor, one that, while not denying the seriousness of suffering, at the same time acknowledges our complicated, flawed, and yet precious existence. Authoritative, accessible, personal, profound\u2014there's never been a book on suicide like this. It will help you understand yourself and your loved ones, and it will change the way you think about this most vexing of human problems. Jesse Bering is the author of Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us , Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That? , and The Belief Instinct . He is the director of the Centre for Science Communication at the University of Otago in New Zealand. \"What undergirds Bering's inquiry is the belief that locating the psychological blun - ders that lead to suicide can help, in time, to curb their prevalence.\"\u2014 New Yorker \"Suicide is one of the toughest subjects to write about, and psychologist Bering does it with candor, scientic integrity, and genuine empathy in Suicidal. . . .

Just think about different behaviors you see at a dog park: We have a good understanding of what it means when dogs wag their tails\u2014but what about when they sniff and roll on a stinky spot? Why do they play tug-of-war with one dog, while showing their bellies to another? Why are some dogs shy, while others are bold? What goes on in dogs' heads and hearts\u2014and how much can we know and understand? Canine Condential has the answers. Rooted in the most up-to-date research on cognition and emotion and written by award-winning scientist\u2014and lifelong dog lover\u2014Marc Bekoff, it not only brilliantly opens up the world of dog behavior but also helps us understand how we can make our dogs' lives the best they can possibly be. \"Incomparable. . . .

HUQ How to Save a Constitutional Democracy Democracies are in danger. Around the world, a rising wave of populist leaders threatens to erode the core structures of democratic self-rule. In the United States, the tenure of Don- ald Trump has seemed a decisive turning point for many. What kind of president intimidates jurors, calls the news media the \"enemy of the American people,\" and seeks foreign assistance investigating domestic political rivals? Whatever one thinks of President Trump, many think the Constitution will safeguard us from lasting damage. But is that as-sumption justied? How to Save a Constitutional Democracy mounts an urgent argument that we can no longer afford to be complacent. Drawing on a rich ar-ray of other countries' experiences with democratic backsliding, Tom Ginsburg and Aziz Z. Huq show how constitutional rules can both hin-der and hasten the decline of democratic institutions. The checks and balances of the federal government, a robust civil society and media, and individual rights\u2014such as those enshrined in the First Amend-ment\u2014often fail as bulwarks against democratic decline. The sobering reality for the United States, Ginsburg and Huq contend, is that the Constitution's design makes democratic erosion more, not less, likely. Its structural rigidity has had unforeseen consequence\u2014leaving the presidency weakly regulated and empowering the Supreme Court to conjure up doctrines that ultimately facilitate rather than inhibit rights violations. Even the bright spots in the Constitution\u2014the First Amend-ment, for example\u2014may have perverse consequences in the hands of a deft communicator who can degrade the public sphere by wielding hateful language banned in many other democracies. We\u2014and the rest of the world\u2014can do better. The authors conclude by laying out practical steps for how laws and constitutional design can play a more positive role in managing the risk of democratic decline.

Houses and stores and streets dene it in one way. But it's also people\u2014the people who make it their home, some eagerly, others grudgingly. A neighborhood can thrive or it can decline, and neighbors move in and move out. Sometimes they stay but withdraw behind fences and burglar alarms. If a neighborhood becomes no longer a place of sociability and street life, but of privacy indoors and fearful distrust outdoors, is it still a neighborhood? In the late 1960s and 1970s Carlo Rotella grew up in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood\u2014a place of neat bungalow blocks and desolate commercial strips, and sharp, sometimes painful social con-trasts. In the decades since, the hollowing out of the middle class has left residents confronting\u2014or avoiding\u2014each other across an expand-ing gap that makes it ever harder for them to recognize each other as neighbors. Rotella tells the stories that reveal how that happened. Talking with current and former residents and looking carefully at the interactions of race and class, persistence and change, Rotella explores the tension between residents' deep investment of feeling and resources in the physical landscape of South Shore and their hesitation to make a similar commitment to the community of neighbors living there. Blending journalism, memoir, and archival research, The World Is Always Coming to an End uses the story of one American neighborhood to challenge our assumptions about what neighborhoods are, and to think anew about what they might be if we can bridge gaps and commit anew to the people who share them with us.

He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society as well as of the Accademia Nazionale di Agricultura and the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere e Arti. With new surges of activity from reli - gious, political, and military extremists, the destruction of images has become increasingly relevant on a global scale. A founder of the study of early modern and contemporary iconoclasm, David Freedberg has addressed this topic for ve decades. His work has brought this subject to a central place in art history, critical to the understanding not only of art but of all images in society. This volume collects the most signicant of Freedberg's texts on iconoclasm and censorship, bringing ve key works back into print alongside new assess - ments of contemporary iconoclasm in places ranging from the Near and Middle East to the United States, as well as a fresh survey of the entire subject. The writings in this compact volume ex -plore the dynamics and history of icon - oclasm, from the furious battles over images in the Reformation to govern - ment repression in modern South Af - rica, the American culture wars of the early 1990s, and today's cancel culture. Freedberg combines fresh think - ing with deep expertise to address the renewed signicance of iconoclasm, its ideologies, and its impact. This volume also provides a supplement to Freed - berg's essay on idolatry and iconoclasm from his pathbreaking book The Power of Images . Freedberg's writings are of foundational importance to this discus - sion, and this volume will be a welcome resource for historians, museum pro - fessionals, international law specialists, preservationists, and students.

While the philosophical dimension of painting has long been discussed, a clear case for painting as a form of vi - sual thinking has yet to be made. Tra - ditionally, vanitas still life paintings are considered to raise ontological is - sues while landscapes direct the mind towards introspection. Grootenboer moves beyond these considerations to focus on what remains unspoken in painting, the implicit and inexpress - ible that manifests in a quality she calls pensiveness . Different from self-aware or actively desiring images, pensive im - ages are speculative, pointing beyond interpretation. An alternative pictorial category, pensive images stir us away from interpretation and toward a state of suspension where thinking through and with the image can start. In fluid prose, Grootenboer explores various modalities of visual thinking\u2014 as the location where thought should be found, as a refuge enabling reflec - tion, and as an encounter that provokes thought. Through these considerations, she demonstrates that artworks serve as models for thought as much as they act as instruments through which thinking can take place. Starting from the prem - ise that painting is itself a type of think - ing, The Pensive Image argues that art is capable of forming thoughts and shap - ing concepts in visual terms.The Pensive Image Art as a Form of Thinking HANNEKE GROOTENBOER '(C(0%(5 240 p. 16 color plates, 26 halItones Institut f\u00fcr Kunst at the Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste, Berlin and visiting professor in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of Chicago.

One of the most far-reaching transfor - mations in our era is the wave of digital technologies rolling over\u2014and upend - ing\u2014nearly every aspect of life. Work and leisure, family and friendship, com - munity and citizenship have all been modied by now-ubiquitous digital tools and platforms. Digital Technology and Democratic Theory looks closely at one signicant facet of our rapidly evolving digital lives: how technology is radically changing our roles as citizens and par - ticipants in democratic governments. To understand these transformations, this book brings together contributions by scholars from multiple disciplines to wrestle with the question of how digital technologies shape, reshape, and affect fundamental questions about democ - racy and democratic theory. As expec - tations have whiplashed\u2014from Twit - ter optimism in the wake of the Arab Spring to Facebook pessimism in the wake of the 2016 US election\u2014the time is ripe for a more sober and long-term assessment.

But something went deeply wrong. Taxpay - ers bore the burden of bailing out \"too-big-to-fail\" banks but got nothing in re - turn. Inequality soared, and a populist backlash against elites shook the foun - dations of our political order. Today, nancial capitalism seems as entrenched as ever, even as we face down another crisis. What is the Left to do? Justice Is an Option uses those prob - lems, and the framework of nance that created them, to reimagine histori - cal justice. Robert Meister returns to the spirit of Marx to diagnose our cur -rent age of nance. Instead of closing our eyes to the political economic reali - ties of our era, we need to grapple with them head on. Meister does just that, asking whether the very tools of nance that have created our vastly unequal world could instead be made to serve justice and equality. Meister formulates here nothing less than a democratic - nancial theory for the twenty-rst cen - tury, one that is equally conversant in political philosophy, Marxism, and con - temporary politics.

Unfortunately much of that ac - tion has not had the kind of impact par - ticipants might want, especially among movements representing the poor and marginalized who often have the most at stake when it comes to rights and equality. Yet, some instances of collec - tive action have succeeded. What's the difference between a movement that wins victories for its constituents and one that fails? What are the factors that make collective action powerful? Prisms of the People addresses those questions and more. Using data from six movement organizations\u2014includ - ing a coalition that organized a 104-day protest in Phoenix in 2010 and another that helped restore voting rights to the formerly incarcerated in Virginia\u2014Hahrie Han, Elizabeth McKenna, and Michelle Oyakawa show that the power of successful movements most often is rooted in their ability to act as \"prisms of the people,\" turning participation into political power just as prisms trans - form white light into rainbows. Un - derstanding the organizational design choices that shape the people, their leaders, and their strategies can help us understand how grassroots groups achieve their goals.

And in a larger sense: What explains why some laws are repealed, and yet others endure in spite of considerable efforts? Are repeals dif - ferent from law-making or do they mir - ror one another? Why are repeals more likely at some times than others? What theories of legislative behavior and pol - icymaking explain when repeals hap - pen?

Decades into its existence as a founda - tional aspect of modern political and economic life, the welfare state has be - come a political cudgel, used to assign blame for ballooning national debt and tout the need for personal responsibil - ity. At the same time, it affects nearly ev - ery citizen and permeates daily life\u2014in the form of pension, disability, unem - ployment benets, healthcare, parental leave policies, and more. At the core of that disjunction is the question of how we as a society decide who should get what benets\u2014and how much we are willing to pay to do so. Probable Justice traces a history of social insurance from the eighteenth century to today, from the earliest ideas of social accountability through the advanced welfare state of collective responsibility and risk. At the heart of Rachel Z. Friedman's investigation is a study of how probability theory allows social insurance systems to flexibly measure risk and distribute coverage. The political genius of social insur - ance, Friedman shows, is that it allows for myriad accommodations of needs, risks, nancing, and political aims\u2014and thereby promotes security and fair - ness for citizens of liberal democracies.Probable Justice Risk, Insurance, and the Welfare State RACHEL Z.

Her previous books include Insecure Majorities: Congress and the Perpetual Campaign and Beyond Ideology: Politics, Principles, and Partisanship in the U.S. Senate .To many observers, Congress has be - come a deeply partisan institution where ideologically distinct political parties do little more than engage in legislative trench warfare. A zero-sum, winner-take-all approach to congressional poli - tics has replaced the bipartisan comity of past eras.

In The Limits of Party , James M. Curry and Frances E. Lee challenge this conventional wisdom. By construct - ing legislative histories of congressional majority parties' attempts to enact their policy agendas in every Congress since the 1980s and by drawing on interviews with Washington insiders, the authors analyze the successes and failures of congressional parties to enact their leg - islative agendas. Their conclusions will surprise many congressional observers: Even in our time of intense party polariza - tion, bipartisanship remains the key to legislative success on Capitol Hill. Congressional majority parties today are neither more nor less successful at enacting their partisan agendas. They are not more likely to ram though parti - san laws or become mired in stalemate.

He is a game designer, lmmaker, camera designer, and the founding director of the Vibrant Media Lab. The Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames announces itself as \"A lm deal - ing with the relative size of things in the universe,\" and in it, we see two people enjoying a picnic on a sunny day before the view zooms up and away to show the park where they sit, the city around the park, the continent, the whole globe, and progressively farther into space, lightyears beyond the initial scene. It then moves back in for a close-up of the hand of the picnicker, travelling deep into the microscopic realm. Zach - ary Horton calls this effect the \"cosmic zoom,\" a trope that has influenced countless media forms over the past seventy years. The Cosmic Zoom uses this visual and conceptual flight through the scales of the universe as a starting point to devel -op a cross-disciplinary theory of scale as mediated difference. It considers the origins of our notions of scale, how sca - lar mediation functions differently in analog and digital modes, and how cos - mic zoom media has influenced both scientic and popular understandings of the seen and unseen world. These considerations, Horton shows, are vi - tal to addressing the major questions of both climate change and big data, which he treats as two facets of a single issue: scalar mediation. Through analy - ses of literature, lm, digital media, and database history, Horton brings our ob - session with scale into sharper focus, establishing a much-needed framework for thinking about scale across multiple domains and disciplines.

Catalano is professor emeritus of philosophy at Kean University in New Jersey and the author of several books, most recently, Reading Sartre: An Invitation . He lives in Manhattan, New York. It is hard to think of two philosophers less alike than St. Thomas Aquinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. Aquinas, a thirteenth-century Dominican friar, and Sartre, a twentieth-century philosopher and atheist, are separated by both time and religious beliefs. Yet, for philosopher Joseph S. Catalano, the two are worth bringing together for their shared concern with a fundamental issue: the uniqueness of each individual person and how this uniqueness relates to our mutual dependence on each other. When viewed in the context of one another, Sartre broadens and deepens Aquinas's outlook, updating it for our present planetary and social needs. Both thinkers, as Catalano shows, bring us closer to the reality that surrounds us, and both are centrally concerned with the place of the human within a temporal realm and what stance we should take on our own freedom to act and live within that realm. Catalano shows how freedom, for Sartre, is em - bodied, and argues that this freedom further illuminates Aquinas's notion of consciousness. Compact and open to readers of varying backgrounds, this book rep - resents Catalano's efforts to bring a lifetime of work on Sartre into an ac - cessible consideration of philosophical questions by placing him in conversa - tion with Aquinas, and it serves as a primer on key ideas of both philoso - phers. By bringing together these two gures, Catalano offers a fruitful space for thinking through some of the cen - tral questions about faith, conscience, freedom, and the meaning of life.

That model of po - litical philosophy, driven by an effort to draw a picture of an ideal political society, is familiar from the approach of John Rawls and others. Or is politi - cal philosophy more useful if it takes the world as it is, acknowledging the existence of various morally non-ideal political realities, and asks how people can live together nonetheless? The latter approach is advocated by \"realist\" thinkers in contemporary political philosophy. In Value, Conflict, and Order , Edward Hall builds on the work of Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hamp - shire, and Bernard Williams in order to establish a political realist's theory of politics for the twenty-rst century. The realist approach, Hall argues, helps us make sense of the nature of moral and political conflict, the ethics of compro - mising with adversaries and opponents, and the character of political legitimacy. In an era when democratic political systems all over the world are riven by conflict over values and interests, Hall's conception is bracing and timely.Value, Conflict, and Order Berlin, Hampshire, Williams, and the Realist Revival in Political Theory EDWARD HALL $8*867 256 p. 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-0-226-71828-6 professor emeritus of philosophy from Indiana University\u2014Purdue University Indianapolis. He has published several books including Leo Strauss and Nietzsche ; How Philosophy Became Socratic: A Study of Plato's \"Protagoras,\" \"Charmides,\" and \"Republic ;\" The Enduring Importance of Leo Strauss ; and What a Philosopher Is: Becoming Nietzsche , all with the University of Chicago Press. Plato dispersed his account of how Socrates became Socrates across three dialogues. Thus, Plato rendered his becoming discoverable only to readers truly invested. In How Socrates Became Socrates , Laurence Lampert recognizes the path of Plato's strides and guides us through the true account of Socrates's becoming. He divulges how and why Plato ordered his Phaedo , Parmenides , and Symposium chronologically to give readers access to Socrates's develop -ment on philosophy's fundamental questions of being and knowing. In addition to a careful and precise analysis of Plato's Phaedo, Parmenides, and Symposium, Lampert shows that properly entwined, Plato's three dia - logues fuse to portray a young thinker entering philosophy's true radical pow - er. Lampert reveals why this radicality needed to be guarded and places this discussion within the greater scheme of the politics of philosophy.How Socrates Became Socrates A Study of Plato's Phaedo , Parmenides , and Symposium Otfried H\u00f6ffe is a German philosopher and professor of philosophy at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen, where he directs the political philosophy research program.

In this ambitious book, philosopher Otfried H\u00f6ffe provides a sophisticated account of the principle of freedom and its role in the project of moder - nity. H\u00f6ffe addresses a set of complex questions concerning the possibility of political justice and equity in the mod - ern world, the destruction of nature, the dissolving of social cohesion, and the deregulation of uncontrollable mar - kets. Through these considerations, he shows how the idea of freedom is cen - tral to modernity, and he assesses free - dom's influence in a number of cultural dimensions. Neither rejecting nor defending freedom and modernity, he instead explores both from a Kantian point of view, looking closely at the facets of freedom's role and the fundamental po - sition it has taken at the heart of mod - ern life. Expanding beyond traditional philosophy, Critique of Freedom develops the building blocks of a critical theory of technology, environmental protec - tion, economics, politics, medicine, and education. With a sophisticated yet straightforward style, H\u00f6ffe draws on a range of disciplines in order to clearly distinguish and appreciate the many meanings of freedom and the indispens - able role they play in liberal society.Critique of Freedom The Central Problem of Modernity OTFRIED H\u00d6FFE Translated by Nils F.

Jacques Derrida remains a leading voice of philosophy, his works still reso - nating today\u2014and for more than three decades, one of the main sites of Der - ridean deconstruction has been the arts. Collecting nineteen texts span - ning from 1979 to 2004, Thinking Out of Sight brings to light Derrida's most in - ventive ideas about the making of visual artworks. The book is divided into three sec - tions. The rst demonstrates Derrida's preoccupation with visibility, image, and space. The second contains inter - views and collaborations with artists on topics ranging from the politics of color to the components of painting. Finally, the book delves into Derrida's writings on photography, video, cinema, and theater, ending with a text published just before his death about his complex relationship to his own image. With many texts appearing for the rst time in English, Thinking Out of Sight helps us better understand the critique of rep - resentation and visibility throughout Derrida's work, and, most importantly, to assess the signicance of his insights about art and its commentary.Thinking Out of Sight Writings on the Arts of the Visible JACQUES DERRIDA Edited by Ginette Michaud, Joana Mas\u00f3, and Javier Bassas With New Translations by Laurent Milesi OCTOBER 328 p. 7 halItones 6 x the McDevitt Professor of Jurisprudence and director of the Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession at Georgetown Law Center.

At the same time, law rm partners continue to seek the non-nancial rewards of being members of a distinct profession and are sensitive to whether their rms are committed to providing them.

Anthro - pocentric property is a key driver of biodiversity loss, a silent killer of species worldwide.

In an era when knowledge can travel with astonishing speed, the need for analysis of intellectual property (IP) law\u2014and its focus on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and issues of copy - right\u2014has never been greater. But as Robert M. Farley and Davida H. Isaacs stress in Patents for Power , we have long overlooked critical ties between IP law and one area of worldwide concern: military technology. This deft blend of case studies, theoretical analyses, and policy advice reveals the fundamental role of IP law in shaping how states cre - ate and transmit defense equipment and weaponry. The book probes two major issues: the effect of IP law on innovation itself and the effect of IP law on the interna -tional diffusion, or sharing, of technol - ogy. Discussing a range of inventions, from the AK-47 rifle to the B-29 Super - fortress bomber to the MQ-1 Predator drone, the authors show how IP systems (or their lack) have impacted domes - tic and international relations across a number of countries, including the United States, Russia, China, and South Korea. The study nds, among other results, that while the open nature of the IP system may encourage industrial espionage like cyberwarfare, increased state uptake of IP law is helping to es - tablish international standards for IP protection. This clear-eyed approach to law and national security is thus es - sential for anyone interested in history, political science, or legal studies.Patents for Power Intellectual Property Law and the Diffusion of Military Technology ROBERT M.

By seeking new perspectives in how the chimpanzee compares to other species, the scientists featured offer a richer un - derstanding of the ways in which chim - panzees' unique experiences shape their behavior. They also demonstrate how different methodologies provide different insights, how various cultural experiences influence our perspectives of chimpanzees, and how different ecologies in which chimpanzees live af - fect how they express themselves. Collectively, these chapters remind us of the importance of considering the social, ecological, and cognitive context of chimpanzee behavior, and how these contexts shape our comprehension of chimpanzees.

North American deserts\u2014lands of little water\u2014have long been home to a surprising diversity of aquatic life, from sh to insects and mollusks. But with European settlement, water ex - traction, resource exploitation, and in - vasive species set many of these native aquatic species on downward spirals. In this book, conservationists dedicated to these creatures document the history of their work, the techniques and philoso - phies that inform it, and the challenges and opportunities of the future. A precursor to this book, Battle Against Extinction , laid out the scope of the problem and related conserva - tion activities through the late 1980s. Standing between Life and Extinction brings the story up to date. While the future for some species is more secure than thirty years ago, others are less fortunate. Calling attention not only to iconic species like the razorback sucker, Gila trout, and Devils Hole pupsh, but also to other shes and obscure and fascinating invertebrates inhabit - ing intermittent aquatic habitats, this book explores the scientic, social, and political challenges of preserving these aquatic species and their habitats amid an increasingly charged political dis - course and in desert regions character - ized by a growing human population and rapidly changing climate.Standing between Life and Extinction Ethics and Ecology of Conserving Aquatic Species in North American Deserts Edited by DAVID L.

Her work has been published in Theory and Society , the International Journal of Urban and Regional Research , and Nature , among other journals. As projects like Manhattan's High Line, Chicago's 606, China's eco-cities, and Ethiopia's tree-planting efforts show, cities around the world are devoting serious resources to urban greening. Formerly neglected urban spaces and new high-end developments draw huge crowds thanks to the considerable ef - forts of city governments. But why are greening projects so widely taken up, and what good do they do? In How Green Became Good , Hillary Angelo un - covers the origins and meanings of the enduring appeal of urban green space, showing that city planners have long thought that creating green spaces would lead to social improvement. Turning to Germany's Ruhr Valley (a region that, despite its ample open space, was \"greened\" with the addition of ofcial parks and gardens), Angelo shows that greening is as much a social process as a physical one. She examines three mo - ments in the Ruhr Valley's urban his - tory that inspired the creation of new green spaces: industrialization in the late nineteenth century, postwar demo - cratic ideals of the 1960s, and industrial decline and economic renewal in the early 1990s. Across these distinct his - torical moments, Angelo shows that the impulse to bring nature into urban life has persistently arisen as a response to a host of social changes, and reveals an enduring conviction that green space will transform us into ideal inhabitants of ideal cities. Ultimately, however, she nds that the creation of urban green space is more about how we imagine so - cial life than about the good it imparts.

These animals are regarded as \"Pleistocene megafauna,\" named for the geological era in which they lived\u2014also known as the Ice Age. In Vanished Giants , paleontologist Anthony J. Stuart explores the lives and environments of these animals, moving between six continents and several key islands. Stuart examines the animals themselves via what we've learned from fossil remains, and he describes the landscapes, climates, vegetation, eco - logical interactions, and other aspects of the animals' existence. Illustrated throughout, Vanished Giants also offers a picture of the world as it was tens of thousands of years ago when these gi - ants still existed. Unlike the case of the dinosaurs, there was no asteroid strike to blame for the end of their world. In - stead, it appears that the giants of the Ice Age were driven to extinction by climate change, human activities\u2014es - pecially hunting\u2014or both. The extinc - tion of Ice Age megafauna can be seen as the beginning of the so-called Sixth Extinction, which is happening right now.

At a time when poison was widely feared, the urgent need for effective cures provoked intense excitement about new drugs. As doctors created, performed, and evaluated poison tri -als, they devoted careful attention to method, wrote detailed experimental reports, and engaged with the problem of using human subjects for fatal tests. In reconstructing this history, Rankin reveals how the antidote trials generated extensive engagement with \"experi - mental thinking\" long before the great experimental boom of the seventeenth century and investigates how competi - tion with lower-class healers spurred on this trend.

What's more, this censorship in medicine, which preceded the Co - pernican debate in astronomy by sixty years, has had a lasting impact on how we talk about new and controversial developments in scientic knowledge.

This is his rst book.The question of why an individual would actively kill itself has long been an evolutionary mystery. Pierre M. Durand's ambitious book answers this question through close inspection of life and death in the earliest cellular life. As Durand shows us, cell death is a fascinating lens through which to ex - amine the interconnectedness, in evo - lutionary terms, of life and death. It is a truism to note that one does not exist without the other, but just how does this play out in evolutionary history? These two processes have been studied from philosophical, theoreti - cal, experimental, and genomic angles, but no one has yet integrated the infor -mation from these various disciplines. In this work, Durand synthesizes cellu - lar studies of life and death looking at the origin of life and the evolutionary signicance of programmed cellular death. The exciting and unexpected outcome of Durand's analysis is the realization that life and death exhibit features of coevolution. The evolution of more complex cellular life depended on the coadaptation between traits that promote life and those that promote death. In an ironic twist, it becomes clear that, in many circumstances, pro - grammed cell death is essential for sus - taining life. The Evolutionary Origins of Life and Death PIERRE M.

Dominant depictions show her either as a maternal gure to her younger brother Robert Boyle, one of the most signicant scientists of his day, or as a patroness of the European correspondence network now known as the Hartlib circle\u2014but neither portrait captures the depth of her intellect nor the range of her knowledge and influ - ence. Philosophers, mathematicians, poli - ticians, and religious authorities sought her opinion on everything from deci - malizing the currency to producing He - brew grammars. She practiced medicine alongside distinguished male physicians, treating some of the most elite patients in London. Her medical recipes, politi - cal commentaries, and testimony con - cerning the philosophers' stone gained international circulation. She was an important influence on Boyle and a self-standing historical gure in her own right. Drawing from a wealth of new ar - chival sources, Michelle DiMeo lls out Lady Ranelagh's legacy in the context of a historically sensitive and nuanced interpretation of gender, science, and religion.

Commonly referred to as \"glossolalia,\" it has been the sub - ject of curiosity and vigorous debate for the past two centuries. Glossolalia is both celebrated as supernatural gift and condemned as semiotic alchemy. For some it is mystical speech that ex - ceeds what words can do, and for others it is mere gibberish, empty of meaning. At the heart of these differences is glos - solalia's puzzling relationship to lan - guage. Glossolalia and the Problem of Lan - guage investigates speaking in tongues in South Korea, where it is practiced widely across denominations and con - gregations. Nicholas Harkness shows how the popularity of glossolalia in Ko - rea lies at the intersection of numerous, often competing social forces, interwo - ven religious legacies, and spiritual de - sires that have been amplied by Chris - tianity's massive institutionalization.

Modernity aimed to brush off dynastic, hierarchical authority and to make society anew through the mecha - nisms of marriage, siblinghood, and love. It was, in other words, centered on the nuclear family. But as Daub shows, the dynastic imagination persisted, in time emerging as a critical stance by which the nuclear family's conserva - tism and temporal limits could be ex - posed. Focusing on the complex inter - action between dynasties and national identity-formation in Germany, Daub shows how a lingering preoccupation with dynastic modes of explanation, le - gitimation, and organization suffused German literature and culture. Daub builds this conception of dy - nasty in a syncretic study of the litera - ture, sciences, and history of ideas into the twentieth century. As early modern - ism discovered a standpoint from which to critique the nuclear family, remnants of dynastic ideology kept their hold var - iously on Richard Wagner, \u00c9mile Zola, Stefan George, and Sigmund Freud.

Anyone interested in the rise of Ameri - can corporate capitalism should look to the streets of Baltimore. There, in 1827, citizens launched a bold new venture: a \"rail-road\" that would link their city with the fertile Ohio River Valley. They dubbed this company the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O), and they con - ceived of it as a public undertaking\u2014an urban improvement, albeit one that would stretch hundreds of miles be - yond the city limits. Steam City tells the story of corpo - rate capitalism starting from the street and moving outward, looking at how the rise of the railroad altered the fab - ric of everyday life in the United States. The B&O's founders believed that their new line would remap American eco - nomic geography, but no one imagined that the railroad would also dramatically reshape the spaces of its terminal city. As railroad executives wrangled with city ofcials over their use of urban space, they formulated new ideas about the boundaries between public good and private prot. Ultimately, they re - invented the B&O as a private enter - prise, unmoored to its home city. This bold reconception had implications not only for the people of Baltimore but for the railroad industry as a whole. As Da - vid Schley shows here, privatizing the B&O helped set the stage for the rise of the corporation as a major force in the post-Civil War economy. Steam City examines how the birth and spread of the American railroad\u2014 which brought rapid communications, fossil fuels, and new modes of corporate organization to the city\u2014changed how people worked, where they lived, even how they crossed the street.

Project - ing three-dimensional realities onto two-dimensional surfaces, maps are abstractions that capture someone's idea of what matters within a particular place; they require selections and omis - sions. It is these very characteristics, however, that give maps their impor - tance in understanding how humans have interacted with the natural world and that give historical maps especially the power to provide rich insights into the relationship between humans and nature over time. That is just what is achieved in Mapping Nature across the Americas . Illustrated throughout, the essays in this book argue for the greater analysis of historical maps in the eld of environmental history and for great - er attention within the eld of the his - tory of cartography to the cultural con - structions of nature contained within maps. This volume thus provides the rst in-depth and interdisciplinary in - vestigation of the relationship between maps and environmental knowledge in the Americas, from sixteenth-century indigenous cartography in Mexico to the mapping of American forests in the United States during the early conser - vation years of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Two common answers\u2014free will and religion\u2014are in some ways fundamentally opposed. While free will enjoys a central place in our ideas of spontaneity, authorship, and the con - scious weighing of alternatives, religion is less a quest for agency than a series of practices that relieve individuals of their will. What, then, is agency, and why has it occupied such a central place in theories of the human? Automatic Religion explores an un - likely series of episodes from the end of the nineteenth century, when crucial ideas related to automatism and, in a different realm, religion as a topic of study were both being born. Paul Chris -topher Johnson draws on years of archi - val and ethnographic research in Brazil and France to explore the consequen - tial lines that were being drawn between humans, \"nearhumans,\" and automata.

What does it feel like? What is it good for? Andrea Gadberry looks for answers to these questions in the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and nds them in the philosopher's implicit poetics. Gadberry argues that Des - cartes's thought was crucially enabled by poetry and shows how markers of po - etic genres from love lyric and elegy to the puzzling forms of the riddle and the anagram betray an impassioned nego - tiation with the difculties of thought and its limits. Where others have seen Cartesian philosophy as a triumph of reason, Gadberry reveals that the phi - losopher accused of having \"slashed poetry's throat\" instead enlisted poetic form to contain thought's frustrations. Gadberry's approach to seven - teenth-century writings poses ques - tions urgent for the twenty-rst. Bring - ing literature and philosophy into rich dialogue, Gadberry centers close read - ing as a method uniquely equipped to manage skepticism, tolerate critical am - bivalence, and detect feeling in philoso - phy.

Drawing our attention to a sea of change in the English seventeenth century, when, over the course of a half century, \"conscience\" made a sud - den shift to \"consciousness,\" he traces a line that leads from the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes to the poetry of John Milton, from the prenatal memories of theologian Thomas Traherne to the unresolved perspective on natality, con -sciousness, and ethics in the philosophy of John Locke. Each of these gures responded to the rst-person perspec - tive by turning to the origins of how hu - man thought began. Taken together, as Harrison shows, this unlikely group of thinkers sheds new light on the emer - gence of the concept of consciousness and the signicance of human natality to central questions in the elds of lit - erature, philosophy, and the history of science.Coming To Consciousness and Natality in Early Modern England TIMOTHY M.

Dora Zhang argues that descriptive practices were in fact a crucial site of at - tention and experimentation for a num - ber of early modernist writers, centrally Woolf, Henry James, and Marcel Proust. Description is the novelistic tech - nique charged with establishing a com - mon world, but in the early twentieth century, there was little agreement about how a common world could be known and represented. Zhang argues that the protagonists in her study re - sponded by shifting description away from visualizing objects to revealing relations\u2014social, formal, and experi - ential\u2014between disparate phenom - ena.

He is the author of five books of poems, most recently, Earth - ling, and eight critical works, most recently, The Virtues of Poetry and How Poems Get Made . For more than a century, American po - ets have heeded the siren song of Ezra Pound's make it new , staking a claim for the next poem on the supposed obso - lescence of the last. But great poems are forever rehearsing their own pres - ent, inviting readers into a nowness that makes itself new each time we read or reread them. They create the present moment as we enter it, their language relying on the long history of lyric po - etry while at the same time creating a feeling of unprecedented experience. In poet and critic James Longen - bach's title, the word \"now\" does double duty, evoking both a lyric sense of the present and twentieth-century writers' assertion of \"nowness\" as they crafted their poetry in the wake of Modernism. Longenbach examines the fruitful - ness of poetic repetition and indeci - sion, of naming and renaming, and of the evolving search for newness in the construction, history, and life of lyrics. Looking to the work of thirteen poets, from Marianne Moore and T. S. Eliot through George Oppen and Jorie Gra - ham to Carl Phillips and Sally Keith, and several musicians, including Virgil Thomson and Patti Smith, he shows how immediacy is constructed through language. Longenbach also considers the life and times of these poets, taking a close look at the syntax and diction of poetry, and offers an original look at the nowness of lyrics.The Lyric Now JAMES LONGENBACH AUGUST 128 p. 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 ISBN-13: 978-0-226-71599-5 Cloth CRITICISM 80 special interest Lisabeth During is associate professor of philosophy and aesthetics at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. In The Chastity Plot , Lisabeth During tells the story of the rise, fall, and trans - formation of the ideal of chastity. From its role in the practice of asceticism to its associations with sovereignty, violence, and the purity of nature, it has been loved, honored, and despised. Obses - sion with chastity has played a powerful and disturbing role in our moral imagi - nation. It has enforced patriarchy's double standards, complicated sexual relations, and embedded in Western culture a myth of gender that has been long contested by feminists. Still not yet fully understood, the chastity plot remains with us, and the metaphysics of purity continue to haunt literature, religion, and philosophy. Idealized and unattainable, sexual renunciation has shaped social institutions, politi - cal power, ethical norms, and clerical abuses. It has led to destruction and passion, and to seductive fantasies that inspired saints and provoked libertines. As During shows, it should not be un - derestimated. Examining literature, religion, psychoanalysis, and cultural history from antiquity through the middle ages and into modernity, During provides a sweeping history of chastity and insight into its subversive potential. Instead of simply asking what chastity is, During considers what chastity can do, why we should care, and how it might provide a productive disruption, generating new ways of thinking about sex, integrity, and freedom. The Chastity Plot LISABETH DURING\"With astonishing breadth, sophisti - cation, and erudition, The Chastity Plot spans from philosophy to literature and from Hollywood mov - ies to Greek tragedy. With differ-ent global genealogies of chastity coming to the fore, investigating its grammar and place in West-ern culture is a crucial and timely endeavor. Rather than sanctifying chastity as source of perfection or dismissing it as source of oppres - sion, During gives us the geneal-ogy of the Western chastity plot in all of its complexity, ambivalences, and polyphonies.\"\u2014Chiara Bottici, author of Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary )(%58$5< 392 p. 6 x 9 Melvin L.

While historians have long privi - leged the genre's popular origins, op\u00e9ra comique was brought under the protec - tion of the French crown in 1762, thus consolidating a new venue where \"of - cial\" music was debated and dened.

In this book, sociologist Max Besbris shows how agents successfully upsell, inducing buyers to spend more than their ini - tially stated price ceilings. His research reveals how face-to-face interactions influence buyers' ideas about which neighborhoods are desirable and which are less-worthy investments and how these preferences ultimately contribute to neighborhood inequality. Stratication denes cities in the contemporary United States. In an era marked by increasing income segrega -tion, one of the main sources of this in-equality is housing prices. A crucial part of wealth inequality, housing prices are also directly linked to the uneven dis - tribution of resources across neighbor - hoods and to racial and ethnic segrega - tion.

Challenging the traditional model of powerful forces, in The Hinge , Gary Alan Fine emphasizes and describes those meso-level collectives, the orga - nizations that bridge our individual interests and the larger structures that shape our lives. Focusing on the ex - istence of \"tiny publics,\" he describes these meso-level social collectives as \"hinges\": groups that come together to pursue a shared social goal, bridging the individual and the broader society.

Rafalow is a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society and a social scientist at Google. This is his rst book.In the digital age, schools are a central part of a nationwide effort to make ac - cess to technology more equitable, so that all young people, regardless of identity or background, have the op - portunity to engage with the technolo - gies that are essential to modern life. Most students, however, come to school with digital knowledge they've already acquired from the range of activities they participate in with peers online. Yet, teachers, as Matthew H. Rafalow re - veals in Digital Divisions , interpret these technological skills very differently based on the race and class of their stu - dent body. While teachers praise affluent white students for being \"innovative\" when they bring preexisting and sometimes disruptive tech skills into their class - rooms, less affluent students of color do not receive such recognition for the same behavior. Digital skills exhibited by middle-class, Asian American stu - dents render them \"hackers,\" while the creative digital skills of working-class, Latinx students are either ignored or earn them the label of troublemakers. Rafalow nds in his study of three Cali - fornia middle schools that students of all backgrounds use digital technology with sophistication and creativity, but only the teachers in the school serving predominantly white, affluent students help translate the digital skills students develop through their digital play into educational capital. Digital Divisionsprovides an in-depth look at how teach - ers operate as gatekeepers for students' potential, reacting differently accord - ing to the race and class of their student body. As a result, Rafalow shows us that the digital divide is much more than a matter of access: it's about how schools perceive the value of digital technology and then use them day-to-day.Digital Divisions How Schools Create Inequality in the Tech Era MATTHEW H.

Attached was a virus, the Love Bug, and within days it had been circulated across the globe, paralyzing banks, broadcasters, and businesses in its wake, and extending as far as the UK Parliament and, reportedly, the Pentagon. The outbreak presaged a new era of online mayhem: the age of Crime Dot Com . In this book, investigative journalist Geoff White charts the astonishing develop-ment of hacking, from its conception in the United States' hippy tech community in the 1970s, through its childhood among the ruins of the Eastern Bloc, to its coming of age as one of the most dangerous and pervasive threats to our connected world. He takes us inside the work-ings of real-life cybercrimes, drawing on interviews with those behind the most devastating hacks and revealing how the tactics employed by high-tech crooks to make millions are being harnessed by nation states to target voters, cripple power networks, and even prepare for cyber-war. From Anonymous to the Dark Web, Ashley Madison to election rigging, Crime Dot Com is a thrilling, dizzying, and terrifying account of hacking, past and present, what the future has in store, and how we might protect ourselves from it. Geoff White is an investigative journalist who has covered technology for numerous outlets, including the BBC and Channel 4 News (UK).\"Brilliantly written and researched, Crime Dot Com is a vivid insight into the scale of the threat to us all from crime born of and facilitated by the digital age.\"\u2014Jon Snow, Channel 4 News (UK) \"White offers up a comprehensive and intelligible account of the elusive world of hacking and cybercrime over the last two decades. . . .

Wigs are present at parties and in chemotherapy rooms, in pop music and contemporary art. In this witty and eloquent book, Luigi Amara reflects on the curious history of the wig and along the way takes a sideways look at Western civilization. Amara illuminates how the wig has starred throughout history, from ancient Egypt to the court of Louis XIV, and from British courtrooms to drag shows today. Contain-ing many striking and unusual images, The Wig will appeal to all those interested in the history of fashion\u2014as well as philosophy, art, culture, and aesthetics.

Long before a few seventeenth- century minds started to decipher their true, organic nature, fossils had been eaten, dropped in goblets of wine, buried with the dead, and adorned bodies. What triggered such curious behavior was the belief that some fossils could cure illness, protect against being poisoned, ease the passage into the afterlife, ward off evil spirits, and even kill those who were just plain annoying. But above all, to our early prehistoric ancestors, fossils were the very stuff of artistic inspiration. Drawing on archaeology, mythology, and folklore, Ken McNamara takes us on a journey through prehistory with these curious stones, and he explores humankind's unending quest for the meaning of fossils. Ken McNamara is a paleontologist and former director of the Sedgwick Museum at the University of Cambridge. He is the author of Shapes of Time and The Star-Crossed Stone , published by The University of Chicago Press.\"McNamara opens window after window on the use and interpretation of fossils by different cultures from Ireland to Australia over the millennia and up to the present.

Personal ambition, revenge, and anger have encouraged many to violent deeds, like the Turkish sul- tan who had nineteen of his brothers strangled or the bodyguards who murdered a dozen Roman emperors. More recently have come new motives like religious and political fanaticism, revolution and libera-tion, with governments also getting in on the act, while many victims seem to have been surprisingly careless: Abraham Lincoln was killed after letting his bodyguard go for a drink. So, do assassinations work? Drawing on anecdote, historical evidence, and statistical analysis, Assassins' Deeds delves into some of history's most notorious acts, unveil- ing an intriguing cast of characters, ingenious methods of killing, and many unintended consequences.

From Richmond to Rainham, Cockfosters to Croydon, this sweeping literary tour of the thirty-two London Boroughs describes how writers, from the seventeenth century on, have responded to and ctionally reimagined London's suburbs.

Wanderers traces their foot- steps, from eighteenth-century parson's daughter Elizabeth Carter\u2014 who desired nothing more than to be taken for a vagabond in the wilds of southern England\u2014to modern walker-writers such as Nan Shepherd and Cheryl Strayed. For each, walking was integral, whether it was rambling for miles across the Highlands, like Sarah Stoddart Hazlitt, or pacing novels into being, as Virginia Woolf did around Bloomsbury. Offering a beguiling view of the history of walking, Wanderers guides us through the different ways of seeing\u2014of being\u2014 articulated by these ten pathnding women. Kerri Andrews is a senior lecturer in English literature at Edge Hill Univer- sity.

Peter Staneld lays down a path through the British pop revolution, its attitude and style, as it was uniquely em-bodied by the band: rst, under the mentorship of arch-mod Peter Meaden, as they learned their trade in the pubs and halls of suburban London; and then with Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, two aspiring lmmakers, at the very center of things in Soho. Guided by the con-cerns of contemporary commentators\u2014among them George Melly, Lawrence Alloway, and, most conspicuously, Nik Cohn\u2014Staneld tells the story of a band driven by fury, and of what happened when Town-shend, Daltrey, Moon, and Entwistle moved from backroom stages to international arenas, from explosive 45s to expansive concept albums.

SMITH Smart Machines and Service Work Automation in an Age of Stagnation In recent decades digital devices have reshaped daily life, while tech companies' stock prices have thrust them to the forefront of the business world. In this rapid, global development, the prom- ise of a new machine age has been accompanied by worries about accelerated joblessness thanks to new forms of automation. Jason E. Smith looks behind the techno-hype to lay out the realities of a period of economic slowdown and expanding debt: low growth rates and an increase of labor-intensive jobs at the bottom of the service sector. He shows how increasing inequality and poor working conditions have led to new forms of workers' struggles. Ours is less an age of automation, Smith contends, than one in which stagnation is intertwined with class conflict. Jason E. Smith lives in Los Angeles.

But many of these are among the most mysterious and alluring in the his - tory of art. Paintings such as The Three Philosophers and The Tempest remain compellingly elusive, seeming to deny the viewer the possibility of interpret - ing their meaning. Tom Nichols argues that this visual elusiveness was essential to Giorgione's sensual approach and that ambiguity is the dening quality of his art. Through detailed discussions of all Giorgione's works, Nichols shows that by abandoning the more intellec - tual tendencies of much Renaissance art, Giorgione made the world and its meanings appear always more inscru - table.Giorgione's Ambiguity TOM NICHOLS Renaissance Lives OCTOBER 288 p. 40 color plates, 20 halftones 5 1/4 x a lecturer in Italian Renaissance art at the University of Amsterdam and visiting professor at the University of Florence.

Written from an independent perspective, it provides a valuable assessment of our own times, as he shows how the three Germanies (Bonn, Pankow, and today's \"Berlin Republic\") sought to establish governments that could create stable states. \"The amount of political and economic information provided is prodigious. . . .

English art critic John Ruskin was one of the great visionaries of his time, and his infl uential books and letters on the power of art challenged the foundations of Victorian life. He loved looking. Sometimes it informed the things he wrote, but often it provided access to the many topographical and cultural topics he explored\u2014rocks, plants, birds, Turner, Venice, the Alps. In The Art of Ruskin and the Spirit of Place , John Dixon Hunt focuses for the rst time on what Ruskin drew, rather than wrote, offering a new perspec-tive on Ruskin's visual imagination.

He is the author of many books. In this historical tour de force, Roy Porter takes a critical look at represen-tations of the body in health, disease, and death in Britain from the mid-seventeenth to the twentieth century. Porter argues that great symbolic weight was attached to contrasting con-ceptions of the healthy and diseased body, and that such ideas were mapped onto antithetical notions of the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly. With these images in mind, he explores aspects of being ill alongside the prac-tice of medicine, paying special atten-tion to self-presentations by physicians, surgeons, and quacks, and to changes in practitioners' public identities over time. Porter also examines the wider symbolic meanings of disease and doc-toring and the \"body politic.\" Porter's book is packed with outrageous and amusing anecdotes portraying diseased bodies and medical practitioners alike. \"Porter is one of the world's best historical writers: his prose is pithy, wit-ty, vivid, engaging and perfectly paced. . . .

Perhaps none of her works display that qual- ity as clearly as On the Royal Road . Three weeks after Donald Trump's election, Jelinek mailed her German editor the rst draft of this play, which turns out to be a stunningly prescient response to Trump and what he represents. In this drama we discover that a \"king,\" blinded by himself, who has made a fortune with real estate, golf courses and casi-nos, suddenly rules the United States, and the rest of the people of the world rub their eyes in disbelief until no one sees anything anymore. As topical as the evening news, yet with insight built on a lifetime of closely observing politics and culture, On the Royal Road brings into focus the phenomenon of right-wing populism, which spreads like a vi-rus and has a lasting effect on global politics. Carefully perched some-where between tragedy and grotesque, high-pitched and squeamish, Jelinek in this work questions her own position and forms of resistance.

We Defy Augury moves easily from Cixous's Algerian childhood, to Bacharach in the Rhineland, to, eerily, the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center, in the year 2000. In one of the most astonishing passages in this tour-de-force performance of the art of digression, Cixous proclaims: \"My books are free in their movements and in their choice of routes [...] They are the product of many makers, dreamed, dictated, cobbled together.\" This unique experience, which could only have come from the pen of Cix-ous, is now available in English, and readers are sure to delight in this latest work by one of France's most celebrated writer-philosophers.

The question may sound like a theological quibble, or even a joke, but in The Kingdom and the Gar- den, Giorgio Agamben uses it as a starting point for an investigation of human nature and the prospects for political transformation. In a tour-de-force reinterpretation of the Christian tradition, Agamben shows that the Garden of Eden has always served as a symbol for hu-manity's true nature. Where earlier theologians viewed the expulsion as temporary, Augustine's doctrine of original sin makes it permanent, reimagining humanity as the paradoxical creature that has been com-pletely alienated from its own nature. From this perspective, there can be no return to paradise, only the hope for the messianic kingdom. Yet there have always been thinkers who rebelled against this idea, and Agamben highlights two major examples. The rst is the early medi-eval philosopher John Scotus Eriugena, who argued for a radical unity of humanity with all living things. The second is Dante, whose vision of the earthly paradise points towards the possibility of a genuine human happiness in this world. In place of the messianic kingdom, which has provided the model for modern revolutionary movements, Agamben contends that we should place our hopes for political change in a return to our origins, by reclaiming the earthly paradise. Giorgio Agamben is one of Italy's foremost contemporary thinkers. He recently brought to a close his widely influential archaeology of Western politics, the nine-volume Homo Sacer series. Adam Kotsko is an American theologian, religious scholar, culture critic, and translator. Praise for The Church and the Kingdom \"Faithful to its surrounding, as if a similar place almost invokes this, Agamben's text can be regarded as some sort of ser-mon. Contrary to most sermons, however, Agamben's essay does not mainly have the faithful in mind.\"\u2014 Plurilogue The Italian List AUGUST 164 p. 5 1/2 x 7 3/4 ISBN-13: 978-0-85742-786-1 Gazing Eastwards Of Buddhist Monks and Revolutionaries in China, 1957 In 1957, renowned Indian historian Romila Thapar visited China, where, together with Sri Lankan art historian Anil de Silva, she worked at two cave sites that were the locations of Buddhist monasteries and shrines from the rst millennium CE. The rst site was the then lesser known Maijishan in north China, and the second was the famous site of Dunhuang on the edge of the Gobi desert in Northwest China. Now, decades later, she is supplementing the aca-demic work that emerged from that trip with a captivating travelogue: Gazing Eastwards takes readers back to midcentury China, through the observations that Thapar made in her diary during her time at the two archaeological sites and her trips there and to other sites. Traveling by train or truck, Thapar met people from throughout the country and all stations in society, from peasants on a cooperative farm to Chair-man Mao himself. An enchanting document of a long-lost era, Gaz - ing Eastwards is a marvel, a richly observed work of travel writing that brings a time and a place fully to life.

Similarly comprising on-the-spot jottings, philosophical reflections, literary commentary, dream narratives and sundry \"notes,\" this book nonetheless differs from the preceding volumes in that the Swiss poet includes more personal material than ever before. Drawing on unpublished notebooks from the years 1952 to 2005, Jacottet offers here passages about his family, the death of his father-in-law and of his mother, his encounters with other major poets\u2014such as Ren\u00e9 Char, Francis Ponge, Jean Tardieu, and his friends Yves Bonnefoy and Andr\u00e9 du Bouchet\u2014and his trips abroad, as well as, characteristically, his walks in the countryside around the village of Grignan, in the south of France, where he has lived since 1953. For a poet who has been noto-riously discreet about his life, this book offers unexpected glimpses of the private man. Above all, the entries in this notebook show how one of the greatest European poets grapples with the discouraging elements of existence, counterbalancing them by recording fleeting perceptions in which \"something else,\" almost like a threshold, seems present. Born in Switzerland and a longtime resident of France, Philippe Jaccottet is a celebrated poet. In 2014, his collected writings were published in Gallimard's prestigious Pl\u00e9iade series. John Taylor has translated many French and Franco- phone poets, including, for Seagull Books, Catherine Colomb, Pierre Chap-puis, and Georges Perros.

Weaving together elements of crime story, Cold War espionage, family tragedy, and a dystopian future, he creates a tap-estry of fragile humanity and menacing inhumanity. The investigation of a series of gruesome killings takes a detective inspector into explora-tions of a secret intelligence program in former East Germany and the role of a family with a tragic history. The more is uncovered, the more disorienting it becomes, and the reader is drawn into a complex web of discovery and suppression. Reinhard Jirgl was born in Berlin in 1953 and is the author of numerous novels that were censored by the GDR but published after the border between East and West Germany opened in 1989.

His book is not so much a call to action as a summons to more vigorous thinking, the examination and reflection that must pre-cede any effective action. The rst section of the book considers this matter tersely: Jean-Luc Nancy's quickness of language and grace of humor lead the reader carefully past the dangers of oversimplication, toward a general awareness of meaningful being. In the last section, Nancy examines the realities of terrorist actions\u2014specically those that shocked Paris a few years ago, and more generally the frightening world of politics without conscience, where conscience is the root of all thinking. Jean-Luc Nancy is the Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Chair and professor of philosophy at the European Graduate School. Charlotte Mandell has trans- lated more than forty books, including several other works by Jean-Luc Nancy. She lives in the Hudson Valley with her husband, the poet Robert Kelly. Praise for Jean-Luc Nancy 'Nancy is indeed one of the most interest- ing thinkers in France today.'\u2014 Common Knowledge The French List DECEMBER 132 p. 6 x 9 ISBN-13: Porcelain Poem on the Downfall of My City Translated by Karen Leeder Porcelain is a book-length cycle of forty-nine poems written over the course of more than a decade that together serve as a lament for Durs Gr\u00fcnbein's hometown, Dresden, which was destroyed in the Allied rebombing of February 1945. The book is at once a history and \"declaration of love\" to the famed \"Venice on the Elbe,\" so catastrophically razed by British bombs; a musical fusion of eyewitness accounts, family memories, and stories, of monuments and relics; the story of the city's destiny as seen through a prism of bio-graphical enigmas, its intimate relation to the \"white gold\" porcelain that made its fortune and reflections on the power and limits of poetry. Musical, fractured, ironic, and elegiac, Porcelain is controversial, too, in setting itself against what Gr\u00fcnbein calls the \"myth\" of the Germans as innocent victims of a war crime. At the same time, it never loses sight of the horror deliberately visited on an unwitting civilian population, nor the devastation that looms so large in the German memory. Pub-lished for the rst time in English, on the seventy-fth anniversary of the rebombing, this edition contains new images, notes, Gr\u00fcnbein's own reflections and an additional canto\u2014an extraordinary act of po-etic kintsugi for the fractured remains of Dresden's memory. Durs Gr\u00fcnbein was born in Dresden in 1962, and now lives in Berlin and Rome. He is professor of poetics and aesthetics at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, and he has written more than twenty-ve books, including poetry, libretti, essays, and translations. Karen Leeder is a writer, translator, and academic, and teaches German at New College, Oxford, where she works especially on modern poetry. \"For a rather long time now\u2014approximately, since the Berlin Wall came down\u2014the name Durs Gr\u00fcnbein has been the answer to the question: Who's the leading young poet in Germany?\"\u2014 Guardian The German List NOVEMBER 96 p. 5 halftones 5 x 8 A Land Like You Translated by Joyce Zonana Cairo 1925, Haret al-Yahud, the old Jewish Quarter. Esther, a beautiful young woman believed to be possessed by demons, longs to give birth after seven blissful years of marriage. Her husband, blind since childhood, does not object when, in her effort to conceive, she participates in Muslim zar rituals. Zohar, the novel's nar-rator, comes into the world, but because his mother's breasts are dry, he is nursed by a Muslim peasant\u2014also believed to be possessed\u2014who has just given birth to a girl, Masreya. Suckled at the same breasts and united by a rabbi's amulet, the milk-twins will be consumed by a pas-sionate, earth-shaking love. Part fantastical fable, part realistic history, A Land Like You draws on ethno-psychiatrist Tobie Nathan's deep knowledge of North African folk beliefs to create a glittering tapestry in which spirit possession and religious mysticism exist side by side with sober facts about the Brit-ish occupation of Egypt and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Free Ofcers' Movement. Historical gures such as Gamel Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, and King Farouk mingle with Nathan's ctional characters in this riveting and revealing tale of an Egypt caught between tradition and modernity, multiculturalism and nationalism, oppression and freedom. Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Universit\u00e9-Paris VIII, Tobie Nathan is the author of a dozen novels and numerous psychoanalytic studies. A pioneering practitioner of ethno-psychiatry, in 1993 he founded the Centre George De-vereux, where he worked primarily with migrants and refugees. He has served as a diplomat in Israel and Africa and is a Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres. A Land Like You was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt in 2015. Joyce Zonana is a writer and literary translator and professor emerita of English at the City University of New York.

As a writer, Brigitte Reimann could not help but tell a compelling story, and that is borne out here in her diaries, which are gripping as any novel. She recorded only what mattered: telling details, emotional truths, and political reali-ties. Never written for publication and rst published in full in Ger-man only after the fall of the Berlin Wall, these diaries offer a unique record of what it felt like to live in a country that no longer exists, was represented for years largely through Cold War propaganda, and is still portrayed in fairy-tale Stasi dramas. Here we get a sense of lived experience, as if Doris Lessing or Edna O'Brien had been allowed in with their notebooks. This volume continues where her earlier book of diaries, I Have No Regrets , left off, in 1964. It sees Reimann grow wistful and at times bitter, as her love life, her professional life, and her health all suffer. Yet throughout she retains a lively appetite for new experiences and a dedication to writing. Finally she nds security in a surprising new love, and although she died soon after this volume ends, the novel she was writing was to become a much-read cult hit after her death. A remarkable document from a time and place that we still strug- gle to see clearly, It All Tastes of Farewell is unforgettable, a last gift from an essential writer. Brigitte Reimann (1933-73) was a German teacher and writer. Her novel Ankunft im Alltag is regarded as a masterpiece of socialist realism. Steph Morris has translated a range of German prose, poetry, and drama, ranging from Ilse Aichinger to Feridun Zaimoglu, Martin Suter, and Pina Bausch. He is also a poet and artist.

These were extraordinary times of oppression, poverty, and hopelessness, and the novel depicts everyday life under the brutal communist dicta-torship of Nicolae Ceau\u00e7escu, the unnamed \"one-eared hangman\" in the novel. He is an omnipresent gure, appearing in portraits, in class-rooms and schoolbooks, in the empty food stores, in TV programs, and in obligatory Party demonstrations. He also seems to invade the bodies and minds of the common people, who become cruel to one another during this cruel period of history, just like the dictator. Our narrator is a teenage \"Girl\" who observes life through tangled, almost interminable sentences, as she tried to understand why her family is falling apart, why her mother has three jobs, why her father becomes an alcoholic, and why her grandmother dreams of \"Hun-garian times\"\u2014and most of all, why there is persecution all around. Brutal though the times are, the Girl's narration is far from a mere indictment. It is suffused with love, tenderness and irony. This novel is fundamentally a woman's book; it is written by a woman, with women playing the principal roles in holding together the resilient fabric of society. Evocative of the celebrated wry humor that distinguishes the best of Hungarian literature, The Hangman's House is a tour de force that introduces a brilliant writer to an English-language readership. Andrea Tompa is a Hungarian writer born in Romania in 1971. She is the au- thor of three novels and lives in Budapest. Bernard Adams was born in 1937 in the English West Midlands, was a pupil at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and studied Hungarian and Russian at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He now lives in Z\u00e1nka, in western Hungary. \"The narrator-girl is just eighteen when the novel opens: at its beginning the rst pistol-shots signal the revolution in Romania, around which the book is so devised as never explicitly to say a word about it.

But with the storm clouds of war gathering over Europe, the Politeama Theatre in Buenos Aires is chosen as the venue for the Chess Tournament of Nations. The world's eyes are suddenly xed on Heinz's newly adopted city. Heinz and a colorful cast of characters\u2014drawn from real life, the author's imagination, and stolen from the pages of Stefan Zweig\u2014 nd themselves caught up in a web of political intrigue, romantic entangle-ments, and sporting competition that seems to hold the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Ariel Magnus leaves no stone unturned in his efforts to learn more about his grandfather and the country to which he emigrated in the 1930s. Chess with My Grandfather is a playful, genre-shifting novel com-bining tales of international espionage, documentary evidence, and family lore. In this extraordinary book, Magnus blends fact and ction in a delirious exploration of a dark period of history, family, identity, the power of art and literature and, of course, the fascinating world of chess. Ariel Magnus is an Argentine writer and literary translator. He has published numerous novels and story collections, and he has edited anthologies of Argentine humor and misanthropy. Chess with my Grandfather is the rst to be translated into English. Kit Maude is a Spanish translator based in Buenos Aires. \"Literary ction merges with documentary source materials in a feat of the imagi- nation that carefully reconstructs the Buenos Aires of the period: we wander through Harrods Department Store, watch the boxing at Luna Park and even get drunk at the Gran Rex. . . .

These stories are truly an event in the history of modern Hindi literature\u2014his work marks a complete break from the neo-ro-manticism and mysticism of his predecessors and contemporaries and establishes him as the denitive founder of the modern Hindi short story. His stories are populated with lonely characters from all walks of life: doctors, students, nomadic communities, acrobats, single mothers, soldiers returning from war, neglected children, and more. They are people living on the margins, introspecting their own anxieties and existence in an increasingly uncertain world set in places as far apart as hill stations, anonymous Indian villages, highways, railway compart-ments, and small towns in France. This new collection includes all of Bhuwaneshwar's twelve pub- lished short stories, none of which have been translated into English before now. Cinematic and peerless, these tales combine images, sketches, sounds, fragments, dialogues, and frame-narrative tech-niques of Indian folktales, ultimately creating a montage of modern Indian psyche not found in any other work of Hindi literature. Nearly a century old, Bhuwaneshwar's stories read like they were written in modern times, dealing with questions and anxieties that continue to haunt and reappear, much like his iconic wolves, in the twenty-rst century. Born in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India, Bhuwaneshwar (1910-1957) spent a childhood marked by abject poverty and neglect. He was discovered by the iconic Hindi writer Premchand for his exceptional literary talent in 1933. He enjoyed some success before being shuttered out by the literary commu-nity, which began his tragic and eventually fatal decline into poverty, mental illness, and alcoholism. Saudamini Deo is a writer, photographer, and transla- tor based in Jaipur, India.

Through the eyes of a young Ortho- dox Jewish girl growing up in Tel Aviv, we watch a colorful mosaic of characters from Soviet revolutionaries to weapons runners during the War of Independence. Faced with the difculties of the traumatized adults around her, from panic attacks to suicide attempts, the girl seeks moments of wonder among the struggle and tragedy. We join her as she moves amid the Tel Aviv streets, avoiding the spots exposed to Arab sniper re; seeks literature of the wider world in a city awash in translations of Soviet propaganda novels; and navigates the idiosyncrasies of the adults around her. With her, we listen in on political discussions, reminiscences of Russia and wartime Eastern Europe, and Soviet revolutionary songs accompanied by balalaikas. We track the lives of the couple for which the novel is named. Mrs. Yankinton smuggled grenades in her baby's carriage during Israel's War of Independence; for years after, she would end every day standing at attention, alone in her living room, when the national anthem came over the radio. Mr. Yankinton, whose arrest as a revolutionary in Soviet Russia foiled his plans to study medicine, became the proud curator of the Zionist visionary Jabotinsky's complete works. In this rich mosaic of scenes and characters from postwar Tel Aviv, Shihor muses on the vital signicance of the act of remembering and of the search for flashes of magic in the darkness. Rachel Shihor has written several works on philosophy, and a bilingual (Hebrew-English) collection of short stories Stalin Is Dead: Stories and Aphorisms on Animals , Poets and Other Earthly Creatures . Her most recent book was the novel Days of Peace , also published by Seagull Books. She lives in Tel Aviv. Sara Tropper is a translator and linguistic editor living in Efrat, Israel. Esther Frumkin is a translator living in the Jerusalem area. She grew up in Massachusetts and has lived in Israel since 1987. \"Shihor takes risks in her choice of form as well as content: her preferred genres\u2014the fable, the aphorism, the novella\u2014have been, historically, unconventional in Western literature, and the stories she chooses to tell hint at an unsettling ten-sion and articiality at the base of the society that emerged from the twentieth-century. . . . The essential thing is to have the courage and honesty to examine our lives with a clear and steady eye, and this is exactly the gift Shihor so gracefully of-fers us through her ction.\"\u2014 Asymptote NOVEMBER 168 p. 143 SANDRO PENNA Within the Sweet Noise of Life Selected Poems Translated by Alexander Booth Widely considered to be among the most important Italian poets of the twentieth century, Sandro Penna was born and raised in Perugia but spent most of his life in Rome. Openly gay, Penna wrote verses celebrating homosexual love with lyri-cal elegance. His writing alternates between whimsy and melancholia, but it is always full of light. Juggling traditional Italian prosody and subject matter with their gritty urban opposites in taut, highly concentrated poems, Penna's lyr-ics revel in love and the eruption of Eros together with the extraordi-nary that can be found within simple everyday life. There is something ancient in Penna's poetry, and something Etruscan or Greek about the poems, though the landscape is most often of Rome: sensual yet severe, sinuous yet solid, inscrutable, intangible, and languorous, with a Sphinx-like and sun-soaked smile. Penna's city is eternal\u2014a mythi-cally decadent Rome that brings to mind Paris or Alexandria. And though the echoes resound\u2014from Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Baudelaire to Leopardi, D'Annunzio, and Cavafy\u2014the voice is always undeniably and wonderfully Penna's own. Sandro Penna (1906-77) was an Italian poet. During his life, he was awarded two of Italy's most important literary awards, the Premio Viareggio and the Premio Bagutta. His work has been translated into many languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish, and has appeared in numer-ous anthologies of Italian poetry. Alexander Booth is a writer and translator who lives and works in Berlin. \"I have made a cult of you . . . perhaps the greatest and most delightful Italian poet alive.\"\u2014Pier Paolo Pasolini \"I believe that one day, in another age, if there is another age, the poetry of Sandro Penna will be read by all and his greatness recognized by all.\"\u2014Natalia Ginzburg The Italian List JANUARY 120 p. 5 x ISBN-13: Hold of Stars Coolitude Translated by Nancy Naomi Carlson Cargo Hold of Stars is an ode to the forgotten voyage of a forgot- ten people. Khal Torabully gives voice to the millions of in-dentured men and women, mostly from India and China, who were brought to Mauritius between 1849 and 1923. Many were trans-ported overseas to other European colonies. Kept in close quarters in the ship's cargo hold, many died. Most never returned home. With Cargo Hold of Stars , Torabully introduces the concept of \"Coolitude\" in a way that echoes Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire's term \"Negritude,\" imbuing the term with dignity and pride, as well as a strong and resil-ient cultural identity and language. Stating that ordinary language was not equipped to bring to life the diverse voices of indenture, Torabully has developed a \"poetics of Coolitude\": a new French, peppered with Mauritian Creole, wordplay, and neologisms\u2014and always musical. The humor in these linguistic acrobatics serves to underscore the violence in which his poems are steeped. Deftly translated from the French by Nancy Naomi Carlson, Cargo Hold of Stars is the song of an uprooting, of the destruction and the re-construction of the indentured laborer's identity. But it also celebrates setting down roots, as it conjures an ideal homeland of fraternity and reconciliation in which bodies, memories, stories, and languages mingle\u2014a compelling odyssey that ultimately denes the essence of humankind. Khal Torabully is a poet, essayist, lm director, and semiologist who has pub- lished over twenty-ve books. Nancy Naomi Carlson is a poet, translator, and editor based in Maryland. A recipient of a literature translation fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, she is also a senior translation edi-tor for Tupelo Quarterly . \"A clear, prospective dimension accom - panies the memory of the forgotten, devoured by history, in this song of love with its Homeric reminiscences.\" \u2014Ottmar Ette \"Whether you have a valentine this month or not, this love poem by prize-winning Mauritian poet and thinker Torabully is not to be missed.\"\u2014 Johannesburg Review of Books The French List JANUARY 200 p. 6 1/4 x 9 I Did Not Die Translated by Isis Nusair Edited by Levi Thompson \"I gathered these texts like someone collecting body parts. Here are the pieces of my body, haphazardly brought together in a paper bag. It looks like me with all my madness and sickness\u2014how the revolution made me grow up, what the war broke inside me, and what exile chipped away.\" The texts gathered in Ever Since I Did Not Die by Syrian-Pales-tinian poet Ramy Al-Asheq are a poignant record of a fateful journey. Having grown up in a refugee camp in Damascus, Al-Asheq was imprisoned and persecuted by the regime in 2011 during the Syrian Revolution. He was released from jail, only to be recaptured and imprisoned in Jordan. After escaping from prison, he spent two years in Jordan under a fake name and passport, during which he won a literary fellowship that allowed him to travel to Germany in 2014, where he now lives and writes in exile. Through seventeen powerful testimonies, Ever Since I Did Not Die vividly depicts what it means to live through war. Exquisitely weaving the past with the present and fond memories with brutal realities, this volume celebrates resistance through words that refuse to surrender and continue to create beauty amidst destruction\u2014one of the most potent ways to survive in the darkest of hours. Ramy Al-Asheq is a Syrian-Palestinian poet, journalist, and curator based in Berlin. He has published ve poetry collections in Arabic, and many of his texts have been translated and published around the world. He launched the German-Arabic magazine FANN in 2017 and was recently selected as a fellow at the Academy of Arts in Berlin and Academy Schloss Solitude.

This gift made him wonder anew why rabbits were their symbol of visitation: \"How did this kind of creature become such a powerful way of feeling your presence?\" Through philosophy, history, education, art, and personal musing on everyday uncanny experiences, Menza reveals why people have long found rabbits our special kin and emblems of love. Menza considers human nature and how we are undone by separation\u2014both from one another and from our childhood selves. Surprising allies in these non-traditional philosophical wanderings include Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, William Shakespeare, Elizabeth Bowen, William Turner, Al-bert Murray, Beatrix Potter, Henry Koster's lm Harvey Leopold Senghor, and Lev Vygotsky. Menza offers examinations of what symbols are and how they work, the value of dialect, and the subversive lessons in animal fables, along-side his thoughts on language learning, memory, and slavery. Only now did he see that he'd taken to Brer Rabbit early on. Just as the Uncle Remus tales displayed the small hero's virtues in warm dialogues, The Rabbit Between Us shows how we abound in talents and moves when we \"lean like Socrates did to the Aesop in us.\" Gentle and political at once, this unique book will appeal to any intellectually curious reader. Raised in Buffalo, New York, Victor Menza (1953-2013) attended the Univer- sity at Buffalo and then Johns Hopkins as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow for a PhD in philosophy. He received a National Endowment for the Humanities award for his teaching at Dartmouth College and writing on Plato. He left to work in prose and in practice outside the academy.

John Taylor has translated several French and Francophone poets, including Catherine Colomb, Pierre Chappuis, and Philippe Jaccottet. Should you nd yourself strolling along the coastal heights of Douarn-enez, a Brittany town near the western-most point of continental France, you would do well to look out for a signpost marked, \"Georges Perros (1923-1978) 'Dazzled by the sea.'\" Perros, who fa-mously made that remark and settled here in 1959, was initially an actor but is now best known for his literary output, which was marked by stylistic freshness and frank criticism. Perros lived anony-mously in the shing port of Douarn-enez, scraping by as a freelance author and manuscript reader who taught and published a few books, but mostly cor-responded with fellow writers or rode his motorcycle along the country roads. Indeed, Perros is known for his fame-shunning habits and for choosing to take up residence far from the sophisti-cation of the capital city. But behind the folksy, sometimes sighing, sometimes bitter, sometimes sar-donic, even sometimes resigned voice, lurks an intensely sensitive, highly cultivat-ed ruminator on the human condition. He is best remembered for the autobio-graphical poems collected in Blue Poemsand An Ordinary Life , as well as for Paper Collage , his three-volume compendium of maxims, vignettes, short prose narratives, occasional diary-like notations, critical re-marks, and personal essays. This edition presents a selection of these touching and thought-provoking short texts alongside numerous maxims, a genre in which Per-ros excelled. With typical modesty, the au-thor called himself a journalier des pens\u00e9es , a day labourer who tills thoughts. As read-ers, we can do no better than to read the tilled thoughts of Georges Perros.

Tess Lewis 's numerous translations from French and German include works by Peter Handke, Jean-Luc Benoziglio, Kalus Merz, in Jean-Luc Benozi- glio's Privy Portrait has fallen on hard times. His wife and young daughter have abandoned him, he has no work or prospects, he's blind in one eye, and he must move into a horribly tiny apartment with his only possession: a twenty- ve-volume encyclopedia. His neighbors, the Shritzkys, are vulgar, narrow-minded, and racist. And be-cause he has no space for his encyclope-dia in his cramped room, he stores it in the communal bathroom, and this be-comes a major point of contention with his neighbors. The bathroom is also the only place he can nd refuge from the Shritzkys's blaring television and he barricades himself in it to read his en-cyclopedia, much to the chagrin of the rest of the residents of the building. Darkly amusing, Privy Portrait is the monologue of a man, disoriented by the gaping void of not knowing his own nationality, recounting the nal remnants of his own sanity and his life. In this buffoonish, even grotesque, yet deeply pitiful man, Benoziglio ex-plores, with a light yet profound touch, weighty themes such as the roles of fam-ily, history, one's moral responsibility towards others, and the fragility of per-sonal identity.

With its long history of working con- temporary events into storylines and commenting upon cultural and military confl icts, professional wrestling is in-trinsically political. Its performance\u2014theatricalities, machinations and con-ditions of production, gurations, and audiences\u2014arises from and engages with the world around. Whether fl owing with the mainstream of popular culture or ghting at the fringes, professional wrestling shows us how we are ghting, what we are ghting about, and what we are ghting for. This edited volume asks how pro- fessional wrestling is implicated in the current resurgence of populist politics, whether right-wing and Trump-infl ect-ed, or leftist and socialist. How might it do more than refl ect and, in so do-ing, reaf rm the status quo? While pro-voked by the disruptive performances of Trump as candidate and president, and mindful of his longstanding ties to the WWE, this timely volume looks more broadly and internationally at the infusion of professional wrestling's worldview into the twinned discourses of politics and populism. The contribu-tors are scholars from a wide range of disciplines. Together they argue that the game's popularity and its populist tendencies open it to the left as well as to the right, to contestation as well as to conformity, making it an ideal site for working on feminist and activist proj-ects and ideas.

Christopher J. Lee is associate professor of his- tory at Lafayette College, in Pennsylvania. One of South Africa's best-known writ- ers during the apartheid era, Alex La Guma was a lifelong activist and a mem-ber of the South African Communist Party and the African National Con-gress. Persecuted and imprisoned by the South African regime in the 1950s and 60s, La Guma went into exile in the United Kingdom with his wife and chil-dren in 1966, eventually serving as the ANC's diplomatic representative for Lat-in America and the Caribbean in Cuba. Culture and Liberation captures a differ-ent dimension of his long writing career by collecting his political journalism, literary criticism, and other short pieces published while he was in exile. This volume spans La Guma's po-litical and literary life in exile through accounts of his travels to Algeria, Leba-non, Vietnam, Soviet Central Asia, and elsewhere, along with his critical assess-ments of Paul Robeson, Nadine Gordi-mer, Maxim Gorky, Alexander Sol-zhenitsyn, and Pablo Neruda, among other writers. The rst dedicated collec-tion of La Guma's exile writing, Culture and Liberation restores an overlooked dimension of his life and work, while opening a window on a wider world of cultural and political struggles in Afri-ca, Asia, and Latin America during the second half of the twentieth century.

Idolized as a model of marital obedience and chastity Valmiki's Ramayan, Chandrabati's lyri - cal retelling of Sita's story offers us a fresh perspective. Written in order to be sung before a non-courtly audience, mainly of womenfolk of rural Bengal, Chandrabati's Ramayan adds new char -acters and situations to the story to provide new interpretations of already known events drawing richly on ele - ments of existing genres. Its location in the tales of everyday life has ensured that Chandrabati's Ramayan lives on in the hearts of village women of modern-day India.

The culmination of research under - taken in the rural panchayats of Guja - rat and Tamil Nadu, A Foot in the Door brings the voices of Dalit women to the forefront of the ongoing conversation about their political oppression. The authors examine the patriarchal and caste-based barriers to Dalit women's political participation in Panchayati Raj, explaining clearly that without a more holistic approach, the panchayats will only continue to reinforce exist - ing and undeniably violent hierarchies of caste and gender. Dalit women's political participation remains a risky endeavor and involves very little actual transfer of power. Getting 'a foot in the door' is not enough\u2014the afrma - tive action that secures a Dalit woman's right to enter the panchayats often still silences them in the process of seeking active participation. An essential read for feminist and Dalit scholars working on issues of gender, caste, and political participation, A Foot in the Door argues that there is a need for deep, systemic change at every level of governance\u2014only then can equal and meaningful participation be ensured.

During London's \"gin craze\" in the eighteenth century, the spirit gained popularity\u2014and notoriety\u2014as consumption increased rapidly. In recent years, gin has enjoyed a resurgence, with botanical flavorings offering rened new ways to enjoy the classic cocktail. With this volume, Chris Thorogood and Simon Hiscock provide an account of how gin has been developed and produced. A diverse assortment of aromatic plants from around the world have been used in the production of gin over the course of several centuries, and each combination of botanicals yields a unique flavor prole that equates to more than the sum of its parts. Understanding the different types of formulation, and the main groups of plants used therein, is central to appreciating the drink's complexities and subtleties. Garnished with sumptuous illustrations of the plants that tell the story of this complex drink, this enticing book delves into the botany of gin from root to branch. As this book's extraordinary range of featured ingredients shows, gin is a quintessentially botanical beverage with a rich history like no other.

Victorian Views on Vocabulary as Told in the Pages of Punch The vocabulary of the past is always intriguing, especially when it is no longer used in modern English. Many of the words and phrases that were popular in Victorian England may sound foreign today, but looking to original sources and texts can yield fascinating insight, especially when we see how vocabulary was pillo-ried by the satirists of the day. In That's the Ticket for Soup! , the renowned language expert David Crystal returns to the pages of Punch magazine, England's widely read satirical publication. Crystal has pored through the pages of Punch between its rst issue in 1841 and the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 and extracted the articles and cartoons that poked fun at the jargon of the day. Here we have Victorian high and low society, with its fashion-able and unfashionable slang, its class awareness on display in the vocabulary of steam engines, motor cars, and other products of the Industrial Revolution. Then, as now, people had strong feelings about the flood of new words entering English. Swearing, new street names, and the many borrowings from French provoked continual irritation and mockery, as did the Americanisms increasingly encountered in the British press. In addition to these entertaining examples, Crystal includes commentary on the context of the times and informative glos-saries. This original and amusing collection reveals how many present-day feelings about words can be traced to the satire of a century ago.

He has been summoned to the court of King Noble the Lion, charged with all manner of crimes and misdemeanors. How will he pit his wits against his accusers\u2014greedy Bruin the Bear, pre-tentious Courtoys the Hound, and dangerous Isengrim the Wolf\u2014to escape the gallows? Reynard was once the most popular and beloved character in European folklore, as familiar as Robin Hood, King Arthur, or Cin-derella. His character spoke eloquently for the voiceless and disen-franchised, but also amused and delighted the elite, capturing hearts and minds across borders and societal classes for centuries. Based on William Caxton's bestselling 1481 English translation of the Middle Dutch, this edition is an imaginative retelling of the Reynard story, expanded with new interpretations and innovative language and char-acterizations. With its themes of protest, resistance, and duplicity led by a personable, anti-heroic Fox, this gripping tale is as relevant and controversial today as it was in the fteenth century.

These gardens were not merely ornamental; even the most elaborate and fashionable gardens had areas set aside for growing herbs, fruit, vegetables, and flowers for domestic use. Meanwhile, more modest households considered a functional garden to be a vital tool for the survival of the house and family. The seventeenth century was also a period of exciting introductions of plants from overseas, which could be used in all manner of recipes. Using manuscript household manuals, recipe books, and printed herbals, The Domestic Herbal takes the reader on a tour of the produc-tive garden and of the various parts of the house\u2014kitchens and service rooms, living rooms and bedrooms\u2014to show how these plants were used for cooking and brewing, medicines and cosmetics, in the making and care of clothes, and to keep rooms fresh, fragrant, and decorated. Recipes used by seventeenth-century households for preparations such as flower syrups, snail water, and wormwood ale are also included. A brief herbal gives descriptions of plants both familiar and less known to today's readers, including the herbs used for common tasks like dye-ing and brewing, and those that held a particular cultural importance in the seventeenth century. Featuring exquisite colored illustrations from John Gerard's herbal book of 1597 as well as prints, archival ma-terial, and manuscripts, this book provides an intriguing and original focus on the domestic history of Stuart England.

How is a chaperone connected to a bird of prey? What is the etymology behind cloud architect? Is there a link between secretaries and secrets? The story behind these (and many more) job titles is rarely pre-dictable and often fascinating. In this highly original book, linguist Alexander Tulloch examines the etymology behind a selection of trades and professions, unearthing intriguing bits of historical infor-mation along the way. Here readers will nd explanations of common surnames, such as Spencer, Hayward, and Fletcher; obsolete jobs such as pardoner, cordwainer, or telegraph boy; and roles for the modern era, such as wedding planner, pundit, and sky marshal. Packed with additional etymological information and literary quotations, this book will appeal not only to linguists, but to anyone interested in the quirky twists and turns of meaning that have led to the familiar job titles of today.

Gentlemen were asked to leave their swords at home and ladies to come without hoops in their skirts in order to t more people into the audience. The initial performance was so well-received in Dublin that an encore perfor-mance was given a few weeks later. Why then, did this now famous and beloved oratorio receive a somewhat cool reception when it premiered in London less than a year later? Placing Handel's best-known work in the context of its times, this vivid account charts the composer's working relationship with his librettist, the gifted but demanding Charles Jennens, and looks at Handel's varied and evolving company of singers together with his royal patronage. Through examination of the original composition manuscript and Handel's own conducting score, held in the Bodleian Library's collection, The Making of Handel's Messiah sheds new light on the piece's construction, performance, and reception. Exploring the complex history of one of the most successful pieces of choral music of all time, this volume examines issues around the performance of sacred texts in a non-sacred context, particularly Handel's collaboration with the men and boys of the Chapel Royal. This book also explores the later reception and performance history of the piece, including the festival performance attended by Haydn, the massed-choir tradition of the Victorian period, and today's \"come-and-sing\" events. Andrew Gant is an author, composer, former organist of Her Majesty's Chapels Royal, and stipendiary lecturer in music at St Peter's College, Oxford.The Making Of SEPTEMBER 144 p. 54 color plates 6 3/4 x 8 1/4ISBN-13: 978-1-85124-506-2 Paper $25.00 MUSICNAM Bodleian Library, University of Oxford 159 PETER HUNT The Making of Lewis Carroll's Alice and the Invention of Wonderland Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass are two of the most famous, translated, and quoted books in the world. What began as a simple tale told by eccentric Oxford mathematician Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) to Alice Liddell, daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, become a worldwide phenomenon. Fostering lm adaptations and retellings, and influencing countless other works, the Alice books have a deeply cherished place in popular culture. Known for their oddities and absurdities, the books have been endlessly interpreted and analyzed for symbolism and hidden mes-sages. Peter Hunt cuts away the psychological speculation that has grown up around the Alice books, and instead traces the historical sources of their multilayered in-jokes and political, literary, and philosophical satire. He situates the books in the history of children's literature and explores the local and personal references that the real Alice would have understood. Equally fascinating are the rich fragments about everything from the \"sensation\" novel to Darwinian theory\u2014not to mention Dodgson's personal feelings\u2014that he wove into the books as they developed. Illustrated with manuscripts, portraits, Sir John Tenniel's original line drawings for the rst editions, and contemporary photographs, this is an innovative look at two remarkable stories. The Making of Lewis Carroll's Alice and the Invention of Wonderland takes us on a guided tour from the treacle wells of Victorian Oxford through an astonishing world of politics, philosophy, humor, and nightmare.

However, a nineteenth-century plan to tear the medieval library down and replace it was only narrowly prevented. This brief history of Europe's oldest surviving aca - demic library begins with its origins in the thirteenth century, when a new type of community of scholars was rst be - ing set up, and follows through to the present day and its multiple functions as a working college library, a unique resource for researchers, and a delight for curious visitors. Drawing on the remarkable wealth of documentation in the college's ar - chives, this is the rst history of the li - brary to explore collections, buildings, readers, and staff across more than seven hundred years. The story is told in part through stunning color images that depict not only exceptional trea - sures but also the library furnishings and decorations, and which show man - uscripts, books, bindings, and artifacts of different periods in their changing contexts. Featuring a historical time - line and a floor plan of the college, this book will be of interest to historians, alumni, and tourists alike. Merton College Library JULIA C.

The artist, known simply as \"Mariano,\" explored variations on central themes that reappeared and evolved throughout his lifetime, most famously his iconic \"gallo\" (rooster) paintings. The McMullen Museum's exhibition and catalog offer an expanded look into Maria-no's six-decade career from interdisciplinary perspectives. Essays con-sider Mariano's formative association with Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Lozano and the Mexican School in the thirties and the symbiotic relationship that developed between Mariano and Cuban intellectuals to create a rich cultural history in the forties. The catalog discusses Mariano's shift from guration to abstraction in the fties and his return to guration with startling grotesque imagery in the sixties. There is also a focus on Mariano's nal period, which explores the individual and the collective, both compositionally and politically, in the seventies and eighties. Together, these essays illuminate both Mariano's rootedness in traditional forms of Cuban symbolism and his forging of a unique style that came to characterize his work beyond \"lo cubano.\" Elizabeth Thompson Goizueta teaches Hispanic studies and Latin American and Peninsular art, culture, and literature at Boston College.

With masterpieces by such artists as Vermeer, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Titian, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jan Steen, Claude, and Canaletto, this publication offers new insights into these world-famous works of art. The authors encourage readers to look at the works in a new way and to consider how Claude paints a sky; how Rubens models the landscape through his use of color; and how Titian uses contrast to add gravitas to a portrait. Rather than re-treading the old boards of provenance and attribution, the authors seek to engage with differ-ent, perhaps riskier and more subjective, questions: asking not when were they painted and by whom, but why should we concern ourselves with them? A short introduction gives an account of the creation of the Picture Gallery and tells the story of the monarchs who curated this extraordinary collection of paintings and how the works entered the Collection.

This volume, the rst of cial history of the Palace, traces the history of the building from its origins as a twelfth-century abbey, to its role today as royal residence and art gallery. Throughout its storied history, the Palace has served many purposes: It has been the unlikely residence of Jacobites, a Russian prin-cess, and even a few lions. The Palace later served as a family home to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on their way to Balmoral and is now used by The Queen each summer to host garden parties and investitures. The Palace of Holyroodhouse covers the uncharted early history of the site and sheds light on well-known stories such as the infamous court murder in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. James IV's lost Renaissance palace is reimagined using newly commissioned archaeological plans and reconstruc-tion drawings of the Palace at various stages in its development. These plans, commissioned speci cally for this vol-ume, are used to illustrate the func-tion and social history of the building and the surrounding landscape. This is the rst of cial publication to trace the history of the Palace of Holyrood-house, making this volume an essential authority on the Scottish Palace.

Foundations, in both senses of the word, naturally play an important role in architecture. Histories and theories of architecture rely upon ideas of foun-dations and beginnings. On the occa-sion of its ftieth anniversary, the ETH Zurich's Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) set out to address the problem of beginnings, looking at its own history and that of architecture in general while analyzing the role of founding myths in particu-lar. As architecture's continual recourse to concepts such as the primitive hut or the three Vitruvian principles ( rm-ness, utility, and beauty) show, myths occupy an important place in profes-sional discourse. The contributions to this issue of gta papers question the tradition of these myths, their potential for interpreting the past, and their role in the design of future projects.

This TONY HALL Gardening With Drought-Friendly Plants Gardening with Drought-Friendly Plants is an essential guide to growing and maintaining plants best suited to our changing climate of warmer, drier summers. Drawing on his two decades of experience working with drought-friendly and Mediterranean plants, gardening expert Tony Hall proles more than two hundred species and cultivars that are suitable for all types of planting environ-ments, whether a large outdoor plot or a small indoor pot. Hall offers tips and advice on maintenance and pruning and shows which plants can survive with minimal tending\u2014perfect for leaving alone during a gardener's vacation. Many of the plants Hall chooses are native to Mediterranean climates and therefore well adapted to growing in hot, dry conditions. These plants provide year-round interest in the garden through the wide varieties in their size, shade, and scent, and continue to perform during winter by way of evergreen color, silver foliage, or attractive dried seed heads. They are also perfectly suited to low water usage, something any gardener should be conscious of in a changing environment. Beautifully illustrated with 170 color photographs, and featuring accessible expert advice on watering, pruning, and other plant care essentials, Gardening with Drought-Friendly Plants is the perfect resource for patio, courtyard, or window gardener. Tony Hall is senior arboretum and gardens manager at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and author of The Immortal Yew and Wild Plants of Southern Spain , both published by Kew Publishing.\"Hall's sound practical advice, keen eye for quality plants and extensive personal experience of drought-friendly plants, make this a 'must have' book for anyone who wants to create a successful water-wise garden.\"\u2014Matthew Biggs. gardener, writer and broadcaster SEPTEMBER 160 p. 170 color plates 8 1/4 x 10ISBN-13: 978-1-84246-709-1 Cloth $35.00 GARDENINGCMUSA 166 Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew JAN HENDRIX Jan Hendrix: Paradise Lost Foreword by Richard Deverell Jan Hendrix is a true international artist: born in the Netherlands in 1949, he traversed Europe during the '70s before landing in Mexico City, his home since 1978. It's tting, then, that the publi- cation of Jan Hendrix: Paradise Lost coincides with an exhibition based on some uniquely far-flung history: the English arrival in Australia in the late eighteenth century, and the wealth of plant samples collected there by Sir Joseph Banks, Kew's unofcial rst director. This book collects works produced by Hendrix over two decades, in a variety of media, in which the ecologically minded artist both responds to the landscape of Australia's Botany Bay and celebrates Banks's legacy. When Banks landed there in 1770 as part of the HMS Endeavor expedition, Botany Bay was a pristine environment teeming with native flora and fauna, which inspired its apt English name. Banks and his crew collected hundreds of plant cuttings, pressing them between the pages of the book Notes on Paradise Lost by Joseph Addison. The historical material collected in Botany Bay and along the Endeav-or River in Queensland is the starting point for Jan Hendrix's beautiful and thought-provoking works, which blend silkscreen, sculpture, and the moving image. The landscape of Botany Bay is today dominated by suburban Sydney, complete with an airport and oil depot\u2014a far cry from the unspoiled landscape Sir Joseph Banks encountered in 1770, and even more threatened now by climate change. Tied to Hendrix's rst solo exhibition in the United Kingdom and featuring a foreword from Kew director Richard Deverell and a slew of supporting texts from art historians Dawn Ades and Deborah Ely, and lmmaker Mike Leggett, Paradise Lost is a tribute to the richness of the natural envi- ronment as well as a stark response to the ecological ravages of global colonialism. Jan Hendrix is a Dutch-born, Mexico-based artist who works in a number of media.SEPTEMBER 160 p. 100 color plates 9 1/4 x 11ISBN-13: 978-1-84246-716-9 Cloth $35.00 ARTCMUSA Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew 167 CHRISTINA HARRISON The Botanical Adventures of Joseph Banks Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820)\u2014the unofcial rst director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew\u2014was a peerless scientic adven-turer and pioneer. Not only did he reveal the floral wonders of the South Pacic, New Zealand, and Australia to European eyes, but he set Kew Gardens on its path to becoming the world's foremost botanic garden, bringing in a wealth of rare and useful plants with far-reaching impact. He helped to raise botanical science to new heights and brought many new beautiful plants to England, which Britons now take for granted in their gardens. Quite simply, no one before or after Banks has had such influence in the sphere of botany. The Botanical Adventures of Joseph Banks is an unprecedented look at Banks's botanical life, providing a breezy and entertaining history of his invaluable contributions by highlighting a selection of the intrigu-ing objects, books, and plants from the collections at Kew Gardens\u2014the place he held dear all his life. Banks had a hand in some of Brit-ain's most well-known historical expeditions, including James Cook's Endeavour voyages in the Pacic and William Bligh's Bounty , and the book lavishly showcases his nautical adventures as well as his dedica-tion to botany with art, photos, and engravings from Kew's collections. Published to coincide with the bicentennial anniversary of his death, The Botanical Adventures of Joseph Banks is a colorful introduction to a one-of-a-kind gure in British history.

OLCOT Frida Kahlo and San Francisco This book marks the triumphant return of Frida Kahlo to San Francisco, the city where her artistic life began to unfold. Kahlo's sojourns to the United States were brief, but forma- tive. It was in the California city\u2014the rst she visited in the United States\u2014that she ventured into a new world beyond the scope of Coyoac\u00e1n, Mexico City, and Cuernavaca. Kahlo rst visited San Francisco in 1930 with her husband Diego Rivera and stayed for a year while he completed murals for the City Club of San Francisco and the San Francisco Art Institute. It was love at rst sight. Kahlo appreciated the beauty of the city, relished its eth-nic diversity, and was mesmerized by neighborhoods like Chinatown. She met fascinating people, many of whom became lifelong friends. It was also in San Francisco that Kahlo began to fashion her indigenous (and now iconic) Mexican identity, deliberately distinguishing herself from the local women, whom she called \"scarecrows\" and \"dull.\" Kahlo rened her sartorial flair, enhanced her political and social worldview, and began to paint seriously. Today she is recognized as a cultural icon and one of the most critically acclaimed artists of the twentieth century. Presented alongside a major exhibition at the de Young museum in San Francisco, this catalogue includes essays exploring Kahlo's role as an artist and her time in San Francisco, as well as a selection of artworks by the artist and photographs of her. Frida Kahlo and San Francisco provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which politics, gender, trauma, and national identity influenced Kahlo's diverse modes of creativity.

This stunning volume presents in large-format illustra-tions the works of Klimt alongside those of artists who were close to him, revealing signi cant and often surprising parallels. With these juxtapositions, we see Klimt contrasted with artists who worked in a variety of style and techniques, all very different from Klimt's. These pages offer new insight into not just the work of Klimt and his con-temporaries, but also the ways that artists share innovations in style and subject, and how the infl uence of an artistic milieu reveals itself in unexpected ways.

This exhibition catalogue, which marks the 100th anniversary of Modigliani's death, shows him for the rst time as a leading member of the avant-garde who carried the revolution of Primitivism well into the 20th century. Modigliani's famous nudes, unusual portraits, and unique sculptures are contrasted with works by Pablo Picasso, Constantin Br\u00e2ncusi, and Andr\u00e9 Derain, as well as artifacts from so-called \"primitive\" cultures. In doing so this volume focuses in particular on Modigliani's lifelong study of the art of Primitivism, which also interested the artist friends who influenced his work.

He describes the city as his muse and has repeatedly recorded it and its people in haunting photographs. This richly produced volume showcases a selection of highly personal images from Frajndlich's oeuvre that are very different from the ubiquitous New York of postcards and posters. The selection of images has been curated in collaboration with the photographer himself, and the works are taken from his own archive\u2014many of them never published or seen before. The result is a multifaceted picture: the black-and-white photographs are sometimes perceptive, sometimes thoughtful, and sometimes witty or quirky\u2014but they are always a declaration of true love for New York.

From Georg Minne and F\u00e9licien Rops to Fernand Khnopff and James Ensor, artists throughout Belgium created portraits, gure paintings, and landscapes that revealed a fascination with the eerie and the nefarious, with Thanatos and Eros. The most remarkable feature of Belgian Symbolism is its predilection for the morbid and the bizarre. Linking this new mysticism with an extravagant and precious style, these artists returned again and again to the central gure of the femme fatale as an expression of excess and lust, often paired with echoes of the esoteric and the demonic. This lavishly illustrated volume reveals Belgian Symbolism in all its brilliant, decadent glory, showing its creativity, reach, and ongoing influence.

Well educated and very well connected, she enjoyed an international reputation, admired by Goethe and Herder and counting among her clients queens and emperors from across the continent. This publication explores the larger-than-life story of the Kauffman myth, which arose even while she was still working as a portraitist. Her remarkable life and work are presented here through beautiful reproductions of more than one hundred of her best paint-ings and drawings, including many never before seen. The book pays particular attention to Kauffman's impact in England, where she was the rst female member of the Royal Academy of Arts. Angelica Kauffman stakes a claim for the artist as a pioneering history painter, fashionable portraitist, and champion of new ideals of masculinity and femininity. Bettina Baumg\u00e4rtel is a German art historian who is head of the painting collection of the Museum Kunstpalast in D\u00fcsseldorf.

Bruegel is known for being technically inno- vative, and this book explores that aspect of his work through a close look at this beloved painting, accompanied by stunning full-page detail reproductions of the work. Using the newest technology available to art historians and working with printed graphics and drawings in addition to the painting itself, the book offers new insight into the ways Bruegel worked and achieved his still-fresh effects. Accompanying an exhibi-tion at the Oskar Reinhart Collection in Winterthur , Switzerland, this catalog has something new to offer even to the most dedicated fan of this European master.

MANN Paintings on Stone Science and the Sacred, 1530-1800 Paintings on Stone examines a fascinating tradition long over- looked by art historians\u2014stone surfaces used to create stun-ning portraits, mythological scenes, and sacred images. Written by an international team of scholars, the catalogue reveals the signif-icance of these paintings, their complex meanings, and their techni-cal virtuosity. Using a technique perfected by Sebastiano del Piombo (1485-1547), sixteenth-century Italian artists created compositions using stone surfaces in place of panel or canvas. The practice of using stone supports continued to engage European artists and patrons well into the eighteenth century. This volume reveals the beauty of these works and examines the complexity of using materials such as slate, marble, alabaster, lapis lazuli, and amethyst. Illustrated with more than one hundred examples, and with essays on topics ranging from importing stone to its relationship to alchemy, Paintings on Stone will become the essential reference on this little-studied practice.

One of the most important representatives of Jugendstil, Mucha attracted a wide audience by moving among genres more skillfully than virtually any other artist of his day. After training as a stage decorator in Vienna, Mucha moved to Paris, where, in the 1890s, he created a stir with his stylistically rened and elegantly executed posters. Mucha's designs represented not merely a personal artistic breakthrough; they also revolutionized the aesthetics of what was still a new medium. In his later works, he developed the inimitable \"Mucha style,\" which celebrat-ed floral elements, lines, and beauty. This book traces the trajectory of Mucha's career, offering brilliant reproductions of his work in various media that showcase his innovative designs.

Only gradually did they realize that in the painter, dead at thirty-one, they had had an outstanding artist in their midst. Today Modersohn-Becker is regarded as one of the pioneers of Expressionism. Sculptor Bernhard Hoetger was one of the few people who recog- nized Modersohn-Becker's talent from an early stage. In 1920, he pub-lished a book collecting his memories of her, and they are reproduced as facsimile here. In addition to Hoetger's writings, the book offers an essay tracing Modersohn-Becker's life and work from a present-day perspective, together with a traditional biographical sketch and repro - ductions of forty of her most important works.

Beginning in 1970 with her arrest in connection with a courtroom shootout, then moving through her trial and acquittal, the book traces Davis's life and work during the subsequent decades and her influen-tial career as a public intellectual. Profusely illustrated with materials found in the archive, including press coverage, photographs, court sketches, videos, music, writings, correspondence, and Davis's politi-cal writings, the book also features interviews with Angela Davis and Lisbet Tellefsen, the archivist who collected those materials, as well as essays that touch on visibility and invisibility, history, memory, and the iconography of black radical feminism.

UNDERWOOD Textures The History and Art of Black Hair Textures synthesizes research in history, fashion, art, and visual culture to reassess the \"hair story\" of peoples of African de-scent. Long a fraught topic for African Americans and others in the diaspora, Black hair is here addressed by artists, barbers, and activists in both its historical perceptions and its ramications for self and society today. Combs, products, and implements from the collec-tion of hair pioneer Willie Morrow are paired here with masterworks from artists like Sonya Clark, Lorna Simpson, Mickalene Thomas, and Alison Saar. Exploring topics such as the preferential treatment of straight hair, the social hierarchies of skin, and the power and politics of display, Textures is a landmark exploration of Black hair and its important, complicated place in the history of African American life and culture.

Their transla-tions of photography challenge the medium's long-assumed qualities of objectivity, legibility, and identication.

Sikander is widely celebrated for expanding and subverting miniature painting to explore gender roles and sexuality, cultural identity, racial and other underrepresented narratives, and colonial and postcolonial histories. This lively volume presents her powerful early work, created between 1987 and 2003, from South Asian, West Asian, and Western perspec-tives, illuminating new understandings for a wide audience. Charting her early development as an artist in Lahore and the United States, the book reclaims her critical role in bringing miniature painting into dialogue with contemporary art, especially in Pakistan, international art discourse of the 1990s, and contemporary global practices and debates.

Keats poses critical questions, asks us to fundamentally reconsider our assumptions, and proposes radical methods of response. In a time when the environment and human lifeways are experiencing unprecedented change, thought leaders like Keats are needed to encourage us to consider new possibilities\u2014from the absurd to the profound. Since the turn of the millennium, Keats has comprehensively used his academic training in philosophy to present conceptual art projects that he refers to as \"thought experiments.\" These include installations and performances in museums and galler-ies around the globe. His motivation is to make space for exploring ideas, offering provocations, and confronting systems we generally take for granted. By prototyping alternative realities\u2014systematically asking \"what if?\"\u2014these projects probe the world in which we live, exploring the potential for societal change.

Clemente's travels, which nd him frequently alternating among India, New York, and Europe, contribute to the remarkably multifaceted aspects of his works.

Frequently using material derived from corpses or that has come into contact with them, including human blood or water from the washing of dead bodies, she examines through pictures, sculptures, installations, performances, videos, and photographs the brutality of death within the context of violence, unjust social conditions, and gender hatred. Rendering the body into abstract forms that are manifest in red bricks or in mud, water, and blood-soaked cloths, she creates an abstraction from terror itself.

The very personal experiences of flight, of giving up shared communities and having to search for a new identity, have left their mark on his artistic work. Over the past twenty years, those themes have found expression in the form of videos, photos, paintings, and sculptures that interpret these existential experiences. This book presents reproductions of a range of the iconic works that have earned Paci a global reputation, many of which center on themes of uncer-tainty. In one of his most well-known video works, Centro di permanenza temporanea (2007), a group of refugees wait on a set of stairs on an airplane tarmac\u2014yet no airplane arrives. In the sculpture Home to Go (2001), a man carries the roof of a house on his shoulders. These stun-ning works and the accompanying essays take up the topical political subjects underlying Paci's art and examine his oeuvre from various angles, while an interview with Paci and some of his personal poems round out the volume.

In her works, Kraijer examines human nature, rendering the body as synonymous with humanity. Her monumental drawings, photographs, sculptures, and video works sound out and dissolve the boundaries of the human body and reveal hybrid creatures some-where between animal and human. Kraijer primarily portrays female gures whose bodies have mostly undergone a metamorphosis: they dissolve into swarms of sh, fuse with gnarled branches, or become transformed into animals. In her work, the usual boundaries of bodies are constantly sounded out\u2014and crossed. This book presents in large format a selection of Kraijer's works, offering an overview of the artist's oeuvre, and it is accompanied by by an interview with the artist.

This lavishly illustrated volume focuses on the aspect of stagecraft that characterizes all her works. Hausner, who previously worked as a set designer, constructs three-di-mensional settings for her pictures in her studio before she begins painting. Fragments of cars or train compartments become backdrops, and mundane, everyday objects become co-actors in her quirky comic strips. She thus confronts us through staged excerpts with the contra-dictions inherent within ourselves, with facets that we do not reveal to the outside world. Those ctions are what permits her to search with a penetrating vision for the true heart of the matter\u2014and to reveal it in her pictures. Starting with Hausner's early works from the 1990s and tracing her career through her most recent, powerfully moving, Exiles series, this book lures us into the mysterious world of interpersonal relationships.

The Graphische Sam - mlung ETH Z\u00fcrich, which has a long-standing relationship with the artist and which is one of the most important presentation locations for his printed works, is celebrating the occasion with an ex-hibition and a lavishly illustrated jubilee publication. In addition to his portraits, which are now counted among the icons of Swiss art, Gertsch is famous for his captivating landscapes. Less well known, however, are his outstanding early works, created in the 1940s and 1950s, and it is on these that the volume focuses. In consultation with Gertsch him-self, curators chose a number of themes from his own collection and the holdings of the Graphische Sammlung ETH Z\u00fcrich.

But few people are aware of the close links between his begin- nings as an artist and his experience of landscape and nature in the town of Thun and Lake Thun. Sojourns in Thun and its surroundings were crucial to the development of Itten's concept of art and his path towards abstraction. Using examples of the representations of nature in Itten's early work, this volume shows in depth how he discovered his own, very personal\u2014and later internationally famous\u2014approach to art and painting style and presents his pictorial transformation of nature as it extended through to the artist's late works.

I am a painter,\" he declared afterwards. A few years later, in 1921, Klee's friend Wilhelm Hausenstein placed the artist at the center of his book, Kairouan, and was thus one of the rst people to recognize the artist's genius. This edition combines Hausenstein's rare original text with rich examples of Klee's most important works. The particular charm of this volume lies in the unique combination of a monograph on the artist, novel narrating Klee's of development, and an exclusive book presentation. Kairouan is a treasure for long-time lovers of Klee as well as those whose interest has just been awakened. It grants an incomparable insight into the life of Paul Klee as an artist within the context of European art and society. Wilhelm Hausenstein (1882-1957) was a German politician, writer, journalist, art critic, historian, and diplomat.

On her fth birthday Ticka was given a cat, which she named Pitsy. When the Nazis came and abducted her parents, Ticka and Pitsy hid in the wardrobe; the only reason Ticka wasn't discovered and taken away was that Pitsy leaped from the cupboard herself, distracting the Nazis and saving Ticka's life. Alone in war-ravaged Hungary without her parents, Ticka pretended to be a deaf-mute child and traveled across Europe by train, nally reaching the refugee ship Exodus in France, which took her and more than 4,000 other Holocaust survivors to Palestine. But even that wasn't the end of Ticka's story: Exodus was forcibly prevented by British warships from traveling to Palestine, and the refugees were taken back and interned in Germany. It was months before the refu-gees could re-board and try again. Ticka did not reach Israel until May of 1948. Through expressive drawings, sensitive dialogue, and diary-like texts, Esther Shakine tells her own personal story through the tale of little Ticka. Presenting the trauma of war, persecution, and home-lessness from a child's point of view, Exodus also offers an inspiring account of civil courage, hope, and humanity. Esther Shakine was born 1932 in Szeged, Hungary, and survived the Holocaust as a child. She emigrated to Israel on the famous refugee ship Exodus after the war and was raised in a kibbutz.JULY 48 p. 93 color plates 6 3/4 x 9 1/2 ISBN-13: 978-3-7774-3553-4 Paper $17.95 GRAPHIC NOVEL CMUSA 196 Hirmer Publishers 2nd PROOF MARY JULIE Edited by NICOLAUS SCHAFHAUSEN and MIRJAM ZADOFF Tell Me About Yesterday Tomorrow Historical events and our knowledge of them inevitably mold our understanding of today's world. This interdisciplinary volume focuses on institutional memory\u2014on the connec- tion between past and future. Tell Me About Yesterday Tomorrow is a bold and unusual publication whose approaches and themes extend from biographical experiences via intergenerational exchange to the discussion of current social phenomena. To what extent does knowl-edge of the past, or lack thereof, influence our view of the present and our conception of the future? Authors from the realms of history, art, philosophy, journalism, poetry, graphic novels, and lm investigate complex everyday reality in history and the present, directing their attention towards the shifts in political hegemonies which lead to os-tracism, denigration, and destruction. The editors of this volume have explicitly chosen to emphasize an international perspective which shows that social polarization and radicalization are not phenomena limited by national boundaries, but are universal social manifestations in a globally interlinked world. Tell Me About Yesterday Tomorrow includes authors such as Roger Cohen, Liam Gillick, Ydessa Hendeles, Philippe Sands, Geraldine Schwarz, and Niko Wahl. This volume is presented in cooperation with the Munich Documenta-tion Centre for the History of National Socialism, a place of education and remembrance documenting and addressing the crimes of the Nazi dictatorship and their origins, manifestations, and consequences up to the present day.

Villa by Tegethoff Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) is one of the outstand- ing representatives of the Bauhaus movement. He achieved legendary fame as the director of the Bauhaus in Berlin, and later as a teacher at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Two of his major projects\u2014the pavilion built at the World Exhibition in Barcelona in 1929 and the Haus Tugendhat in Brno, Czech Re-public, completed one year later\u2014became icons of Modernist style. The Pavilion of the German Empire was dismantled at the end of the exhibition in Barcelona and underwent a large-scale reconstruction in 1986 to mark the architect's 100th birthday. The Haus Tugendhat, on the other hand, has largely survived despite seventy years of neglect. It was only between 2010 and 2012, however, that it could be meticulously restored to its original state. To mark these reconstructions, the archi-tecture photographer Klaus Kinold has portrayed both buildings in accurate, detailed photographs. To complete the volume, historians of architecture Wolf Tegethoff and Christoph H\u00f6lz outline the construc-tion histories of the two projects and pursue the question of justica-tion for the reconstruction of modern architecture.

A native of Aurich, in East Friesland in Germany, he was a stu- dent at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1930. During his time as a student there, Bredendieck worked with Marianne Brandt to design famous lamps such as the \"Kandem Bedside Table Lamp,\" which can be found on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1937, Bredendieck emigrated to the United States, where he was appointed as a teacher at the New Bauhaus Chicago. From there, he moved on to become the founding director of the Institute for Indus-trial Design at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, and from this perch he established himself as one of the most influential mediators of Bauhaus ideas in America in the postwar years. This richly illustrated volume showcases Bredendieck's life and work in lavish detail.

Introduced by migrant potters around 1500, the medium of maiolica offers a unique point of entry into Venice's material world as it was shaped by Mediterranean trade and local luxury production. This richly illustrated volume explores maiolica's multifaceted connection to objects ranging from Islamic metalwork to Venetian glass and examines the role of maiolica within the vast range of luxury objects made in Venice and imported into the city, highlighting the place of the medium at the nexus of cross-media and cross-cultural exchanges. Thematic discussions investigate the circulation of artifacts and the migration of ornament, the lure of Chinese porcelain, and maioli-ca's position in the material culture of splendor that characterized elite interiors. The book also includes an essay on glass as a Venetian luxury good, written by Christopher Maxwell, curator at the Corning Muse-um of Glass. Global Luxury in Renaissance Venice also addresses works made in the thriving workshops of Jacomo da Pesaro and Domenego da Venezia and suggests a connection between the rise of villeggiatura (a rural holiday retreat) in the mid-sixteenth century and the ascent of Venice's maiolica industry. A work of deep scholarship that is also lavishly produced and full of images of luxurious maiolica, this will appeal to art historians and fans of Venice alike. Karine Tsoumis is the curator of the accompanying exhibition Global Luxury in Renaissance Venice presented at the Gardiner Museum, Toronto, where she serves as the curator of the historical collection. The Gardiner Museum is among the few museums in the world focused on ceramics and one of the world's most notable specialty museums.

Yet even though his works are made with iron, they defy our sense of the metal's heaviness and density: His sculptures radiate lightness and move - ment, inviting the viewer to a playful relationship with ever-changing angles. The heaviness of iron is replaced by an almost flowing dynamism, which suits his works, many of which are abstracted and derived from the constant move -ment of water.

Francis's engagement with the world and his fascination and involvement with different cultures, in particular that of Japan, is explored in this compelling volume, published in conjunction with the exhibition Sam Francis and Japan: Emptiness Overflowing at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Richard Speer, a co-curator of the exhibition, offers astute insights into the visual, technical, and philosophical afnities between tradi-tional Asian art and Francis's work as a modern abstract painter. He delves into the relationship of Francis's aesthetics to much older Japa-nese artistic traditions, in particular the concept of \"ma,\" a symboli-cally rich in-between zone that is paralleled in the lyrical deployment of negative space in Francis's paintings. In addition, Speer looks at Francis's friendships with many of the Gutai and Mono-ha artists and highlights their shared conceptual theories involving notions of time, space, and a limitless continuum. A contemplative and discerning overview of the artist in Japan, the book draws on archival research and individual interviews with Fran-cis's Japanese colleagues, as well as family and friends. It suggests the transformative power of art as a cultural bridge while expanding our insight into the artist's visual language and his devotion to the image. Francis's own aphoristic essay \"One Ocean One Cup,\" rst published in Japan in 1977, revealing the artist's reactions to living and working in the transcendental Japanese environment, rounds out the book.

SULLIVAN Harry Bertoia Sculpting Mid-Century Modern Life Italian-born American Harry Bertoia (1915-78) was one of the most prolic and innovative artists and designers of the postwar period. Trained at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he met future colleagues and collaborators, such as Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, and Eero Saarinen, he went on to make one-of-a kind jewelry, design iconic chairs, create thousands of unique sculptures in-cluding large-scale commissions for signicant buildings, and advance the use of sound as sculptural material. His work speaks to the con-fluence of numerous elds of endeavor but is united throughout by a sculptural approach to making and an experimental embrace of metal. Harry Bertoia: Sculpting Mid-Century Modern Life accompanies the rst US museum retrospective of the artist's career to examine the full scope of his broad, interdisciplinary practice and feature important examples of his furniture, jewelry, monotypes, and diverse sculptural output. Lavishly illustrated, the book offers new scholarly essays as well as a catalog of the artist's numerous large-scale commissions. It ques-tions how and why we distinguish between a chair, a necklace, a screen, and a freestanding sculpture\u2014and what Bertoia's sculptural things, when taken together, say about the fluidity of visual language across culture, both at midcentury and now.

Whether the work was a square, triangle, or circle, or Wilhelm Wagenfeld's lamp, Oskar Schlemmer's Kopf, or white cubes with flat roofs, the Bauhaus created iconic visual symbols and a style that is neither functional nor social but visually striking. Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, from the outset sought to develop the school into a brand\u2014and he succeeded. More than eight decades after its forced closure, the Bauhaus is more present than ever in consumer life, politics, and culture alike. It has become a participative brand that escapes centralized control entirely, forged collectively by countless designers, manufacturers, and consum-ers. Yet its founders' initial pledge for functionality and social commit-ment remains unfullled. In this stunning and pugnacious book, Philipp Oswalt, former di- rector of Foundation Bauhaus Dessau, explores the development of the Bauhaus brand and its use around the world, illustrated with some 950 images that highlight the vast range of Bauhaus appearances across the past century.

Featuring 164 ctitious screen presidents\u2014including the rst female president, seen in the 1964 comedy Kisses for My President \u2014the book shows lm presidents making speeches, in the Oval ofce, riding around in limos, addressing the press, and in more private moments. Graphic designer Lea N. Michel has sorted these presidents into six key types\u2014Father and Husband, Villain, Alien, Clown, Hero, Lover\u2014which she has further sorted into a dizzying 240 subcategories, such as Shaking Hands, Looking Shocked at a Screen, or In a Video Conference with a Terrorist. Drawn from both lms and TV, familiar works and lesser-known productions, the images highlight the intense relationship between c-tion and reality in a time when the sitting president exploits all media to an unprecedented extent to market himself and to increase his popular - ity.

The time has come for repurposing coexistence, aided by post-human thought and technological advance-ment, and for realizing that humans are merely part of, rather than the center of, our world. Potential Worlds: Planetary Memories and Eco-Fictions , published in conjunction Museum f\u00fcr Geg- enwartskunst and Baku's YARAT Contemporary Art Space, questions forms of knowledge developed in the course of annexation of the envi-ronment and asks what ideas of nature might emerge from the current crisis and how we might perceive nature in the future. Thirty-six artists from around the world featured in this book examine the ecological and social consequences of the past and ongoing conquests of land for purposes of accumulating power and resources. Essays by Benjamin H. Bratton, T. J. Demos, Reza Negarestani, and Jussi Parikka shed light on multiple different perspectives, such as colonialism, post-humanism, ecology, and artistic adaption of new technologies, and investigate the potential future of mankind living in alliance with nature and the role of art in this undertaking as a technological, scientic, and social experiment.

Brown is professor of twentieth-century and contemporary art history, theory, and criticism at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas.Jun Kaneko, born in 1942 in Nagoya, Japan, and based in Omaha, Nebraska, since 1986, is revered for his role in es - tablishing modern ceramic art, yet he has been equally prolic in a range of other media. This book offers an entire - ly new and detailed survey and analysis of nearly six decades of Kaneko's work in ceramics, drawing, painting, instal - lation art, and opera design. Tracing the career of this dynamic artist from his early training and subsequent asso - ciation with the pivotal California Clay Movement to his important public com - missions and philanthropic concerns of the present, it focuses in particular on the past twenty years, which have previ - ously not been the subject of a compre - hensive volume. Drawing extensively on interviews he has conducted with Jun Kaneko since 2002, Glen R. Brown reflects on the principal concepts that have shaped Kaneko's art, situating them in the space between a Japanese Shinto ethos and the aesthetic tenets of Western art informel and Post-Painterly Abstrac - tion. These concepts provide context for in-depth discussion of Kaneko's art, from the colossal glazed-ceramic Dangos to the sensitive coloristic stage and costume designs for Madama But - terfly , The Magic Flute , and Fidelio . From these, a fascinating picture emerges of Kaneko's unique, relentlessly self-sus - taining creative process and the mul - tiple conceptions of space that inform it. Featuring two hundred color illustra - tions and substantial information not previously available in published form, this book offers an up-to-date denitive critical survey of this important artist's life and work.Jun Kaneko A Retrospective GLEN R.

She lives and works as a freelance photographic artist in Zurich. Peter Pfrunder is director of the Swiss Foundation of Photography in Winterthur, Switzerland. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the youth of Zurich were rebellious. An entire generation of students sought fervently for the new. Simone Kappeler was one of them, and in 1981 she left her native Switzerland, setting off on a road trip across America. She took with her a 35 mm Hasselblad, as well as a Polaroid. Over the course of the journey, she would add a multitude of cheap cameras to this collection that enabled snapshot-like images\u2014taken un-selfconsciously whenever a motif struck her. The resulting images reflect a direct and unrestrained manner, tell - ing of immediate sensual experience and the longing for freedom and inde - pendence. Decades later, Kappeler has revisit - ed the vast collection that resulted from her undertaking, and the result is this striking volume. Both the selected im - ages and their composition in the book reveal a consistent artistic perspective and a signature style. Through these photographs, we simultaneously see the development of an artist and a lost era of American life.Simone Kappeler-America 1981 Photographs by SIMONE KAPPELER Text by Peter Pfrunder JULY 256 p. 160 color plates, 77 halftones 9 1/4 x 13 1/4ISBN-13: Seung-Hye lives and works in Seoul, where she also teaches as a professor in the Department of Fine Arts, Seoul National University of Science & Technology.Seoul-based artist Hong Seung-Hye has garnered a unique position in the art scene through her bravado in defying conventional borders, whether it's mix - ing the abstract and the gurative or the plane and the three-dimensional.

Along with documentaries on various subjects he has also directed numerous dramas and comedies.Temporality and age are inherent in every object and creature and, depend - ing on one's outlook, may transcend to innity. But how can we imagine that innity? What goes beyond it? In his latest movie about architecture, Swiss lmmaker Christoph Schaub sets out on a personal journey through time and space. He starts in his childhood, when his fascination with sacred build - ings began, as did his wondering about beginnings and ends. In dialogue with architects Peter Zumthor, Peter M\u00e4rkli, and Alvaro Siza, artists James Turell and Cristina Iglesias, and musician Jojo Mayer, Schaub explores the magic of sacred spaces, a term that for him rep - resents much more than just churches. Architecture of Innity traces spiritu - ality in architecture and ne arts as well as in nature, moving beyond the limits of thought. The lightly floating camera immerses the viewer in somnambulistic images, taking us on a sensual and sens - ing journey through vast spaces, guid - ing our eyes towards the star-spangled sky's innity and the depths of the ocean.

Angelika Affentranger-Kirchrath lives and works in Zurich as a freelance publicist, critic, and curator.Swiss artist Sophie Taeuber-Arp (1889- 1943) was a pioneer of the twentieth-century avant-garde. Remarkably versatile and immensely gifted, she produced an oeuvre that encompasses the entire range of the modernist move - ment, from applied and ne art and dance to architecture, interior design, and teaching. This volume offers a close look at one of Taeuber-Arp's most impor - tant works, Equilibre . Created in 1931, it marked the beginning of Taeuber-Arp's career as an accomplished painter, as she moved away from guration to focus on shape and color. Circle, square, and rectangle would dene her future vo - cabulary. While in her earlier textiles she had used multiple shades and hues, she now reduced her palette to primary colors alongside black and white, sig - naling a markedly changed sense of col - or. The painting's title, assigned after Taeuber-Arp's death, emphasizes her constant striving for an ideal balance of color, shape, and indeed all the ele - ments in her paintings. From there, she sets out to explore movement, circles, and spaces, and later gradations and lines. Equilibre , a landmark of Taeuber- Arp's oeuvre, looks ahead to her future subject matter, while at the same time referencing her earlier work; this vol - ume helps us understand Equilibre , and, through it, the entirety of Taeuber-Arp's career.Sophie Taeuber-Arp-Equilibre Landmarks of Swiss Art WALBURGA KRUPP Edited by Angelika Affentranger-Kirchrath Landmarks of Swiss Art JULY 96 p. 39 color plates, 4 halftones 8 3/4 x 10ISBN-13: Affentranger-Kirchrath lives and works in Zurich as a freelance publicist, critic, and curator.Swiss artist Franz Gertsch, born in 1930, is one of the most important exponents of photorealism worldwide. Yet unlike many of his fellow artists, he takes lib - erties when translating a photograph into one of his large-format paintings or prints, thus animating his depictions of human faces or landscapes. This volume offers a close look at a single key work by Gertsch, R\u00fcschegg , created in 1988. It was both his rst at - tempt in woodcut for a landscape and his rst large-format work in that genre. Having abandoned painting a few years earlier, he developed a special wood - cut technique, and, having worked in portraiture almost exclusively for many years, Gertsch used that technique to begin an exploration of nature. Starting from a view of his gar - den in the Swiss village of R\u00fcschegg, Gertsch singled out some of its ele - ments, such as a footpath, rocks, shrubs and trees, grass and leaves, taking them as individual motifs rst for woodcuts and later for monumental \"portraits\" of such pieces of nature. Thus, R\u00fcscheggalso stands for Gertsch's movement away from the representation of hu - mans to that of nature, just as it links his later work with the landscape stud - ies of his early years.Franz Gertsch-R\u00fcschegg Landmarks of Swiss Art ANGELIKA AFFENTRANGER-KIRCHRATH Landmarks of Swiss Art JULY 96 p. 45 color plates, 3 halftones 8 3/4 x 10ISBN-13: 978-3-85881-663-4 Cloth 216 Scheidegger and Spiess Martin St\u00fctzle obtained his education in art at the School of Art and Design in Bern, Switzerland and also trained as a stonemason. He lives and works as a freelance artist in the Swiss Canton of Glarus. Fridolin Walcher lives and works as a photographer in the Swiss Canton of Glarus, pursing freelance artistic and commissioned projects.Glaciers in the Alps and on Greenland have been melting away slowly for de - cades, but in recent years, global warm - ing has increased the speed of their retreat dramatically. The rst survey of the Clariden glacier was conducted by a Swiss geophysicist Alfred de Quervain, who initiated and led important scien - tic expeditions on Greenland in 1909 and 1912. A more recent link between Glarus and Greenland comes in the work of Swiss artist Martin St\u00fctzle and photographer Fridolin Walcher. Both have made the Swiss glaciers the subject of their work, and in May 2018 the duo joined a Swiss research campaign inves -tigating the current state of the glaciers on Greenland. The photographs and prints they produced from the journey reflect an intense awareness of scientif - ic facts, yet they strike the viewer emo - tionally and aesthetically. This book blends the essence of glaciological and geophysical research with contemporary art and picks up on de Quervain's legacy. Prints and pho - tographs are featured alongside three easy-to-read essays offering a concise survey of the ndings of the 2018 expe - dition, while a fourth essay comments on St\u00fctzle's and Walcher's works and explores current trends in climate art.The Glacier's Essence Greenland\u2014Glarus.

From the beginning, Otth's artistic trajec - tory, which was influenced by the prac - tice of painting, became closely tied to the emergence of new technologies. Throughout his career he mixed im - material video projection with material reality and explored their interaction. While constantly questioning the me - dia he used, Otth produced borderline works that test the observer and pro - voke desire through covering-up, re - framing, and shifting.

Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich is one of Europe's leading art museums and will become Switzerland's largest in 2021.

In the run-up to this milestone in the museum's development, this new book looks back at the museum's archi - tectural history. The lively story it tells begins in 1847 with the initial gallery building for the Zurich Artists' Society. In 1910, the story of the museum took a major step forward, when distinguished Swiss architect Karl Moser's Kunsthaus was opened. In the twentieth century, three major additions were carried out, in 1925, 1958, and 1976, even as many additional attempts to create a vision - ary large-scale extension were made. Those efforts will bear fruit in the fall of 2021, as Chippereld's addition will give the museum greatly expanded gallery space that offers continuity with the Kunsthaus's history while also looking to the future. Illustrated with historic images, reproductions of plans and drawings, and newly drawn floor and site plans, the book documents all stages of constructing Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich.The Architectural History of Edited by Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich JULY 80 p. 22 color plates, 24 halftones 7 1/4 x 9ISBN-13: 978-3-85881-859-1 Paper $25.00s de Lausanne , founded in 1841, is an art museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.Founded in 1841 and located since Oc - tober 2019 in a striking new building by celebrated Spanish-Italian architects Barozzi Veiga, the Mus\u00e9e Cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne (MCBA) is one of Switzerland's major public art galleries.

Tim-ber frame construction quickly came to dominate the built landscape of America because of the ready availability of the principal material required, the simplicity of construction, and its ability to be erected by low or unskilled workers. The result was a built environment that erased typological and class distinctions of architectural production, as both rich and poor lived in houses that are built the same way. American Framing is a visual and textual exploration of the condi- tions and consequences of these ubiquitous structures, the architec- ture which enables architecture. Archival drawings and historical images, along with newly commissioned photographs by Linda Robbennolt, Daniel Shea, and Chris Strong, in addition to plans and drawings, shed new light on this quintessentially American method of construction.

Projects by Xu Tiantian, DnA_ Beijing Architecture can revitalize, spark rural self-condence, and turn wasteland into a welcoming space\u2014and it can do it at a low cost. This is the mission statement of architect Xu Tian- tian, founder and principal of Beijing-based studio Design and Archi-tecture (DnA). In 2014, Xu began to work in the remote Songyang County in China's Zhejiang Province. Her holistic concept does not en-gage in erasing existing structures but is instead guided by the concept of Architectural Acupuncture, which prefers smaller interventions to extensive redevelopments, and which has gained much recognition as a model for similar regions around the world. For Xu, architecture as a language should address the traditions of Songyang County\u2014each solution is unique; only the small budget is common to all of them. Yet all of them are interrelated and serve the broader goal of mutual enhancement. The Songyang Story introduces Xu's concept of Architectural Acupuncture and discusses the influence of architecture on cultural self-understanding and economic renewal in twenty-rst-century rural China. Richly illustrated, it features some twenty new buildings and conversions of existing structures with diverse functions. These inter-ventions work in the local context and greatly affect Songyang Coun-ty's social fabric, housing, culture, industry, agriculture, landscape conservation, and tourism. Published alongside the illustrations are essays by international economists, sociologists, and curators as well as by the secretary of the Songyang County Party Committee, examining the social, political, and economic implications of sustainable planning and collective action in the Chinese province.

His work spans from futurism through fascism to the ex-perimentations linked to the invention of reinforced concrete. Though he is often remembered exclusively for his early futurist and fascist works, De Giorgio was an architect whose production evolved through-out his life. Until his nal years, he developed his work experimentally and dynamically, a method that had also characterized its beginnings. Quirino De Giorgio: An Architect's Legacy is the rst English-language book dedicated to this innovative Italian architect. The reader experi- ences this constellation of the ninety-nine surviving buildings through stunning images by photographer Enrico Rizzato whose pictures cap-ture the universality of De Giorgio's built designs in their present state. Site plans, floor plans, and sections provide deeper insight into De Giorgio's spatial, structural, urban, and landscaping inventions, while a newly reconstructed list of De Giorgio's works offers new guidance for scholars. The perfect introduction to this highly original, yet still too little-known architect, Quirino De Giorgio: An Architect's Legacy emphasiz - es how time marked and transformed De Giogio's creations and takes us on a journey across the different facets of Italian architecture.

Storing, packaging, classifying, assembling, and other ancillary processes of manufacturing and distribution are car-ried out 24/7 in extensive logistics parks. Their vast sites, often brightly lit during night hours, have doubled in terms of area covered every four years during the past two decades. These \"steel cities,\" as some locals have termed them, occupy increasing amounts of what has been fertile farmland, deeply affecting the lives of local residents and creat-ing entirely new relationships. Steel Cities investigates the impact of these vast industrial estates on landscape and society from various perspectives. It reveals the architectural and spatial, legal, economic, social, and environmental ramications of the logistics system in this region and elsewhere. It examines the ensembles of windowless steel boxes on three scales: as an architectonic-landscape entity the size of a small town, as a network that reshapes the map of Europe so to dene its own territoriality, and as part of the everyday life of the workers inside and the residents around them.

They made their name in the years following Ger - many's reunication, when dozens of prefabricated plattenbauten in the former German Democratic Republic needed refurbishment and moderniza - tion. Rather than demolishing and re - building housing structures, SFA care - fully adjusted existing buildings to the new needs of fewer people and more humanness in the shrinking cities of the newly formed federal states in the reunited country's east. Since then, SFA have moved on, ex - ploring the topic of housing in increas - ingly dense metropolitan environments and creating a remarkable and mani - fold body of work in this eld. Their de - signs comprise large-scale public multi-unit blocs, townhouses, at times by way of transforming former ofce and public administration buildings.

Yet Milan is a leading global city eco - nomically as well, regarded as one of the \"Four Motors in Europe.\" How did Milan become a city of such impor - tance both economically and artistical - ly? Its remarkable position is the result of the constant modernization Milan undertook throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The city's up - per classes were the main drivers of this development, which made Milan a true metropolis\u2014one that reflected their common interests, rooted in keen en - trepreneurship, a sense of history, and their origins. In Ideas of Ambiente , Angelo Lunati investigates the relationship among the Milanese upper class, its specic ur - ban culture, and architecture. Lunati realizes his homage to a metropolitan bourgeoisie through the comprehen - sive concept of \"ambiente,\" reaching beyond the mere built environment to comprise much wider cultural and social aspects as well. Ideas of Ambiente invites us to appreciate Milan's archi - tectural trajectory, from its initial ro - manticism via bold modernism to the elegant yet politically charged aesthetic of the post-WWII period. Lunati dem - onstrates how the \"ambiente\" works as a binding agent to which certain neigh - borhoods owe their environmental unity and how it makes a consistently modern architecture just the latest ex - pression of a historical continuity.Ideas of Ambiente History and Bourgeois Ethic in the Construction of Modern Milan, 1881-1969 ANGELO LUNATI NOVEMBER 288 p. 46 color plates, 68 halftones 7 3/4 x 10 1/4ISBN-13: 978-3-03860-153-1 ARCHITECTUREUK/EU/CN/HK Martino Pedrozzi graduated from EPFL's School of architecture in Lausanne, Switzerland. He runs his own studio in Mendrisio, Switzerland, where he has also been directing the Workshop on International Social Housing at Academy of Architecture since 2003.For more than twenty years, Mar - tino Pedrozzi has been working on the partial reconstruction of derelict dwellings on alpine pastures in the mountains of southern Switzerland. His interventions in Valle di Blenio and Val Malvaglia, at altitudes around 6,500 feet, are part of a plan to protect and preserve the cultivated landscape that was shaped by generations of local farmers grazing their cattle. Pedrozzi collected and put in place again stones that had been used as building material for the ancient dry-stone walled struc - tures, which have been abandoned in recent decades. This recomposition is meant to reconstruct a public space and to retain landmarks in the barren alpine landscape, and also as a monu - ment to the civilization that has lived in and been sustained by it for centuries. This book documents Pedrozzi's work and highlights the problem of ru - ral exodus\u2014a constant phenomenon in the history of human life, caused by conflict, economic change, natural di - sasters, and climate change. It shows, strikingly, how that exodus is mani - fested in this region through moun - tain dwellings that are no longer used because alpine agriculture has been given up in favor of better opportuni - ties and more comfortable ways of life elsewhere.Perpetuating Architecture Martino Pedrozzi's Interventions on the Rural Heritage in Valle di Blenio and in Val Malvaglia 1994-2017 Edited by MARTINO PEDROZZI OCTOBER 104 p. 15 color plates, 81 halftones, 8 1/2 x 11ISBN-13: 978-3-03860-192-0 Cloth JADA GAJDOOV\u00c1 and MATTHEW REEVES Gothic Spirit Medieval Art from Europe This publication brings together nearly thirty masterpieces made across western Europe between the twelfth and six-teenth centuries.

This book explores the his- tory of the painting, from its commission to the display of the stunning nal work. The Bishop of Arezzo regarded patience as the key to his career and achievements and wished it to be represented in a picture. Vasari, assigned the task, consulted his contemporaries and fellow human-ists\u2014as well as the great sculptor Michelangelo, as many surviving letters now reveal\u2014when deciding what form the interpretation of such a virtue should take. The painting depicts the monumental gure of a woman, life-sized, with arms crossed, as she watches time run down. The passing of time is symbolized in the drops that fall from an antique water clock beside her, gradually wearing away the stone on which she rests her foot. The image represents more exactly the Latin tag diuturna tolerantia , or \"daily tolerance.\" The painting quickly became famous in its time and was fre-quently copied\u2014but not until now has the original emerged. Thanks to letters between those involved, the painting and the process of its creation are richly documented. Furthermore, the correspondence reveals new insights and quotations about picture-making from Michel-angelo. The lavishly illustrated volume opens a new window onto the historical importance of Vasari's celebrated work, which is on tempo-rary loan to the National Gallery in London until 2023.

The anniversary offers an occasion to present a number of little-seen masterpieces, including exceptional Alten-bourg, A. R. Penck, Georg Baselitz, and Evelyn Richter. Keeping in the Present invites us to explore eighty-four masterpieces from the oldest publicly accessible specialist collection for art on paper in the German-speaking countries. Founded in 1720, the Kupferstich-Kabinett was intended as a universal collection, open to works from all periods and countries, and the current collection holds true to that past, featuring old masters and young, unknown artists alike. Works that were contemporary and still unknown at the time of their purchase are now among the most treasured items, held in equal esteem with works that entered the collection as acknowledged master-pieces. Keeping in the Present illustrates the innovative and democratic nature of the Kupferstich-Kabinett as a place of creativity, knowledge, critical thinking, and aesthetic pleasure.

Moreau painted biblical and mythological gures, and the watercolors he created to illustrate Jean de La Fontaine's Fables t comfortably into his oeuvre. Yet those paintings have not been showcased for over a century. Gustave Moreau: \"The Fables\" accompanies an exhibition that lls that void, and in the process highlights some of the most striking works of their time. Moreau created his series of fables across a variety of subjects and techniques at the height of the revival of watercolor in nineteenth-century France. With their coloristic effects, the paint-ings tell sophisticated stories that slowly reveal themselves to us, image by image. Gustave Moreau were exhibited to great acclaim in Paris in the 1880s and London in 1886, where critics compared the artist to Edward Burne-Jones. One critic commented on Moreau's \"keen ap-prehension of the weird.\" Of the original sixty-four works in the series, nearly half were lost during the Nazi era. The surviving works have not been exhibited since 1906, and they have only ever been published in black and white. This is the rst book to reproduce the paintings in color\u2014many shown at their actual size. Preparatory drawings, includ-ing animal studies made from life in the Jardin des Plantes, demon-strate the wide-ranging research that informed Moreau's visions.

He began carving at an early age when his father gave him his rst pocketknife, and throughout his life he honed his craft and created artworks that would eventually, in the 1970s, bring him national and then international fame. Elijah Pierce's America seeks to revisit the artist's oeuvre and see it in its own right, rather than as \"na\u00efve,\" as it was known at the time. Through his carvings, Pierce tells his own life story, but he also chronicles the African American experience. He made his living as a barber and was also a qualied preacher; just as his barbershop was a place for gossip and meeting, so his art reflects his own and his com-munity's concerns. His subjects ranged from politics to religion, but he seldom distinguished the race of his gures\u2014he thought of them as everyman gures. His secular carvings show his love of baseball, boxing, comics, and movies, and reflect his appreciation for American heroes who fought for justice and liberty. A critic summarized what Elijah Pierce's America foregrounds in Pierce's artwork: \"He reduces what he wants to say to the simplest forms and compositions. They are decorative, direct, bold, and amus-ing. He uses glitter and all kinds of devices to make his message clear. It gives his work an immediacy that's very appealing.\" Accompanying a major exhibition at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, Elijah Pierce's America shines a light on the sophisticated work of an artist with a distinct and important voice.

Of all the abstract expressionists, de Kooning was the only one who continued to praise Soutine throughout his career and to credit him with an infl uence on his work. But how much was de Kooning's approach impacted by Soutine? Soutine de Kooning dramatically juxtaposes the two artists and shows Soutine's decisive infl uence on the development of de Kooning's art. De Kooning rst discovered Soutine's work before World War II in the galleries of New York. The expressive force of Soutine's paint-ing, coupled with his image as an \"accursed\" artist struggling with the vicissitudes and excesses of bohemian life in Paris during the interwar years, exerted a powerful infl uence on a new generation of postwar painters in the United States. It was during these years that de Koon-ing matured his own personal form of expressionism, which, with its visceral brushstrokes and heavy impasto, lies somewhere between gu-ration and abstraction. And a signi cant turning point in de Kooning's work, evident in his celebrated Women paintings of the early 1950s, coincides with his in-depth study of Soutine at retrospectives at New York's Museum of Modern Art and his visit to the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia. This lavishly illustrated book traces the develop-ment of that infl uence, paying particular attention to the posthumous retrospective of Soutine's work that was held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1950 .

Hofmann's angular abstractions personify the insecurities of the period, but this was also the moment that he moved towards the soft, ambiguous forms that would become the hallmark of the Abstract Expressionist movement\u2014a movement that Hofmann presaged. Hans Hofmann: FURY presents Hofmann's work from 1942 to 1946, demonstrating Hofmann's development towards abstraction while revealing a representational quality that nods to his gurative begin-nings. Linear paintings particularly emphasize this artistic trajectory. Primarily known for his expressive use of bold, often primary colors, Hoffmann here uses a palette of vivid, bright colors, and contrasting dark tones, epitomizing the conflicted postwar feeling. Hans Hofmann: FURY gives particular insight into an essential moment in Hofmann's career\u2014his rst solo exhibition in New York in 1944 at Peggy Guggen-heim's gallery, which Clement Greenberg considered \"a breakthrough in painterly versus geometric abstraction that heralded abstract expres-sionism.\" David Anfam is senior consulting curator at the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver, Colorado, and director of its research center.

Explicitly designed to have monetary value, they can be used for their intended purpose. But coins have also frequently been repurposed to communicate private and public messages\u2014from ad hoc scratchings and punch marks to complete re-engraving of surfaces. As carriers of messages, coins have the advantage of being unobtrusive: They can easily be carried around, and their exchange does not arouse suspi-cion. Tokens of Love, Loss and Disrespect gives insight into the many unof- cial purposes coins served in the past. Drawing on the largest extant collection of defaced coins and tokens, Sarah Lloyd brings together the full range of expertise required to understand the phenomenon, with contributions from eleven scholars and collectors. The book focuses on a period in British history when modication of coinage expressed political commentary, commercial activity, familial and emo - tional commitment, personal identity, and life history. It examines the coins and tokens themselves and looks at who modied them, where, why, and how. Defaced coins and tokens are often enigmatic objects, and this book offers a means of decoding and assessing them, while also drawing attention to their value as a distinctive source of historical evidence. Tokens of Love, Loss and Disrespect considers what these surviv- ing coins reveal about the society in which they were produced and the light they shed on major historical developments of the period.

Sotheby's This vivid, handsomely illustrated account of Thwaytes v. Sotheby's \u2014one of the major art trials of recent times\u2014will be of interest to dealers, conservators, and lawyers as well as all admirers of Caravaggio. In 2006, a Caravaggio scholar bought a ver-sion of the painter's famous Cardsharps at Sotheby's in London for just fty thousand pounds. He then announced the piece was not a replica, as Sotheby's had stated, but was in fact Caravaggio's rst version of the masterpiece\u2014potentially worth up to fty million pounds. Shocked by the news, Lancelot Thwaytes, who had consigned the painting to Sotheby's, sued the auction house for negligence, and the case came to trial at the High Court in London in 2014. This detailed account of Thwaytes v. Sotheby's is told from the inside by an eminent art historian who acted as an expert witness in the case. The verdict had far-reaching implications for the art world, and a question that has been much debated by scholars\u2014whether or not Caravaggio made replicas of his own paintings\u2014ended up becoming a judicial matter.

Too often and for too long, however, medieval Spanish artists have been overshadowed by the art of the Italian and Northern Renaissance and have not received the attention they deserved. Spanish Paintings offers a critical reassessment of the signicance of the medieval art of the Iberian Peninsula. Alberto Velasco Gonzalez sheds light on a group of twenty fascinating paintings from private col-lections that, in many cases, have never before been reproduced in a book. Created across the Christian kingdoms of the Northern Penin-sula and the Southern Muslim state called al-Andalus, these paintings take us on a fascinating journey through what is now Spain and tell the story of the region's incredible creative flowering during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In an extensive introductory essay and each of the subsequent case studies, Velasco Gonzalez explores the imagery, function, and signicance of these works and places them within the broader cultural and historical context of their creation.

Beginning in the late eleventh century, masters and students fl ocked to Bologna to study Roman law, creating the academic setting that gave rise to the city's unique artistic culture. Professors enjoyed high social status and, most important, teachers and students created a tremendous demand for books. By the mid-thirteenth century, the city had become the preeminent center for manuscript production in Italy. In Medieval Bologna , essays by academics, curators, and educators create rich context for the nearly seventy works of art in the exhibi- tion. Drawn primarily from American libraries, museums, and private collections, many of the works have never been studied or published before. The authors discuss the illustrious foreign artists called to work in the city, most notably Cimabue and Giotto; the devastating impact of the Black Death; and the political resurgence of Bologna at the end of the fourteenth century that led to the construction of the Basilica of San Petronio, one of the largest churches in the world. In a captivating illustrated tour of medieval Bologna\u2014its porticoed streets, stunning piazzas, mendicant churches, and more\u2014the authors show us how the city became a center for higher learning and expand our understand-ing of art in the medieval world.

He moved to London, worked weekends as a caf\u00e9 dishwasher and evenings as a toilet attendant in a West End nightclub, and in every spare moment he hammered on the doors of fashion editors until one of them nally opened a tiny crack. Thomas seized the chance to be an unpaid dogsbody at Riva mag - azine, where he worked with legends of style Judy Blame and Isabella Blow and dressed artists like Lisa Stanseld, Boy George, and Kylie Minogue. Soon after, he was hired by Esquire UK and became the youngest fashion editor in the world. He ultimately moved on to edit fashion at Vogue Hommes , Vanity Fair , and Interview , and his work has since been published in a raft of international magazines. In the intervening decades, the business of styling ascended from the pavement to the penthouse. What began as kids playing dress up with ribbons and safety pins evolved into the backbone of a multibil-lion-dollar style and clothing industry. And Thomas, now one of Holly-wood's most successful stylists, rose along with it. Covering more than thirty years of fashion and celebrity, Vanity Project traces the evolution of celebrity styling from the streets of London in the 1980s to the red carpets of Hollywood today. Featuring interviews conducted by Boy George alongside 250 full-color images, the book gives readers a behind-the-curtain look at more than three decades' worth of glamour and tantrums, friendships and rivalries, and the surprisingly hard graft of celebrity styling. Dave Thomas is a celebrity stylist, fashion editor, and costume designer living in Los Angeles. His work as a stylist has been published in Vanity Fair , GQ, Esquire , and Vogue Hommes , and his clients include John Legend, Henry Golding, Calvin Harris, Kane Brown, David Guetta, Lionel Richie, and many more.SEPTEMBER 288 p. 250 color plates, 100 halftones 9 1/4 x 11 3/4ISBN-13: 978-1-913491-00-0 Cloth $59.00 FASHION USCA Unicorn Publishing Group 239 3rd PROOF MARY JULIE SOPHIE CHANG Truth and Beauty The Art of Sophie Chang With an Essay by Ian Strathcarron The latest in the Unicorn Chinese Artists series, Truth and Beauty explores the artistic world of Taiwanese modern and contemporary painter Sophie Chang. Her works incorporate Western painting style into the freehand style of Chinese ink wash paintings, merging Eastern subtleties with Western influences and inte - grating expressive use of colors into metaphysical spirituality. Chang's artistic journey progresses from realistic imagery to spiri- tual abstract languages and through her works she expresses her inner maturity and clarity. In her meditative process, she focuses her mind on nature and manifests in her unique \"inner landscapes.\" She has developed her signature technique to produce dynamic, abstract land-scapes that express the vision in her mind's eye. Using vivid colors and brush strokes, Chang's technique \"shapes\" the paintings by layering new paint on top of old. New pigments blend with old and the upper layer of oil splits, forming a ridge-like shape reminiscent of a looming mountain. The original color of the rst layer is then exposed, mim-icking the rough texture of nature and inviting the viewer to form a deep emotional connection with the objects of her art. Truth and Beauty introduces a signicant voice in Chinese art to an international market. In partnership with Intron International Cultur-al Development, the Unicorn Chinese Artists series features leading Chinese contemporary artists whose works are not yet well known enough outside China.

Herschel Grynszpan, an undocumented Jewish ado- lescent living in Paris, wants to be a champion of his suffering people. Max Schmeling, a world champion boxer, becomes a reluctant symbol of the Third Reich. Their lives intertwine without touching, eventually converging in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen. Dark haired, slight, and with deep-set, haunted eyes, Herschel re- ceives a postcard from his parents\u2014recently taken from their Hanover flat, put on a train, and dumped, with 12 thousand others, on the Polish border. Enraged, Herschel buys a gun and kills a minor German ofcial in the German Embassy. The repercussions of this act trigger Kristallnacht, the opening curtain to the tragedy of the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Max, as a result of his victory over the then-\"invin- cible\" Joe Louis in 1936, has become a poster boy for the Nazis. He and his movie-star wife, Anny Ondra, are feted by the regime\u2014tea with Hitler, a passage on the airship Hindenburg\u2014until his brutal two-minute beating in the rematch with Louis less than two years later. His story reaches a climax during Kristallnacht, where the champion performs an act of quiet heroism. Champion tells a story of tragedy and humanity as World War II unfolds.

An enthusiast for this newly invented device, she traveled the world befriending experts\u2014such as the astronomer John Herschel; the pioneering photographer (and her brother-in-law) Charles Somers-Cocks, 3rd Earl Somers; and the Swedish risk-taking artist Oscar Rejlander\u2014who taught her the magic and the science of the lens. When fourteen-year-old Mary Hillier delivered a message to Julia's door, little did she know what her life would become. Beginning as Julia's parlor maid, Mary went on to become the photographer's leading model and the focus of the artist's creative passion. For Julia, Mary personied the heavenly qualities of her quiet corner of England. For Mary, Julia's influence would echo throughout her life. This is a biography of two women who experienced beauty, love, loss, and fame, and out of them created photographs that, in Julia's own words \"should electrify you with delight and startle the world.\" Spanning the French Revolution until the 1930s, and fully illustrat- ed throughout, Light and Love tells the story of a rare partnership of a pioneer and her muse, and how their relationship would change the course of both of their lives.

Kennedy to the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound. Assassins hope to change the world, but rarely succeed: Baker suggests that the 1914 assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo was the only one that changed the course of history. Other assassinations, whether of monarchs, politicians, dissidents, clerics, journalists, or others, at best give history only a glancing blow. Baker concludes that, in Macbeth's words, an assassination \"is a poisoned chalice.\" In a wide-ranging and informative history, Baker also explores the evolution of assassinations. Since 1945, fewer and fewer assassins work alone. Rather, assassinations are increasingly more likely to be carried out by political and religious terrorists or by the security services of certain states to eliminate dissidents. Russia, Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other governments have utilized targeted killings when they consider their security to be under threat. An eye-opening exploration of the history of killing, On Assassinations shows us that the days of individual assassinations has ended, and a new era of mass murders and state-sponsored killings has begun.

Over the last two centuries, no other journal has brought its readers closer to the spheres of power and influence in Britain. First issued in 1828 in the dying days of the Georgian era, The Spectator came out ready to spar\u2014with the Tories and their Prime Min- ister, with a corrupt political system, and with the lackluster literary world of the day. More than fty prime ministers later, The Spectator has not only watched the world change but waded into the fray: it has cam-paigned on consistently liberal lines, ghting for voters' rights, free trade, a free press, and the decriminalization of homosexuality, while offering open-minded criticism of every modern taboo and orthodoxy. 10,000 Not Out celebrates the magazine's 10,000th issue and re- counts the turbulent and tortuous tales of 192 years chock full of crises and campaigns, of literary flair and barbed wit. Eight chapters chart in technicolor the evolution of the title\u2014from radical weekly newspaper, to moralizing Victorian guardian, to wartime watchdog, to satirical magazine, to High-Tory counselor, to the irreverent but influential magazine of the twenty-rst century. Replete with extracts, anecdotes, and illustrations, the book turns up many forgotten episodes in the The Spectator' s long, lush history.

This is because you are really meant to be a brilliant writer.\" And so now, badgered by Fraser and other writer friends, Reeve has at last put his talents together in a series of self-contained short stories recalling travels, anecdotes, and encounters, vividly illustrated through his colorful vignettes.

He is dangerous to look at,\" said Lady Liddell to her daughter in 1817. Handsome, charismat-ic, aristocratic, and allegedly \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know,\" Lord Byron (1788-1824) is one of the most captivating and recognizable gures of the Romantic Age. His face, gure, and appear-ance added to the appeal of his poetry, and the close association of the man with his poetic creations encouraged a wide range of artists to create portraits during his lifetime and to memorialize him after his heroic death in Greece. The rst work on the subjects of the portraits of the poet, and written by two authorities on the subject, Dangerous to Show explores Byron's life through the intriguing stories behind one hundred of these images. Reproduced in color for the rst time, we can explore the key paintings, miniatures, sculptures, drawings, and sketches, along with a selection of prints, cartoons, engravings, and other rep-resentations of the artist.

Hsiao is the rst and only post-war Chi-nese artist to attempt to convey Eastern philosophical ideas and con-cepts of mindfulness and self-contemplation in the Western pictorial language of abstraction. In 1961, he cofounded the Punto Internation-al Art Movement, which lasted until 1966. Hsiao's works are not only artistic representations of Asian philosophy but, in a broader context, are an intellectualized expression of Asian ideas in their essential forms. The understanding of the entire post-war avant-garde art scene would not be complete without mentioning Hsiao Chin and the Punto Movement, along with American abstract expressionism, French lyrical abstraction, and the Japanese Gutai group. This book records thirteen Punto exhibitions, demonstrating Hsiao's contribution to the international cultural realm throughout his artistic career. Included here are in-depth articles on Hsiao's historical signicance in the twentieth century, as well as an introduction to his iconic oeuvres over the last six decades in work that reconciles Eastern and Western art prospects.

He is perhaps best known for his pictorial poster maps, including the whimsical 1914 \"Wonderground Map\" which proved so popular with riders that it became the rst London Underground poster to be sold commercially to the public and is today considered to have saved the network by increasing off-peak travel. He enjoyed close links with many leading gures in the arts and crafts world, including the architects Sir Charles Nicholson, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and Halsey Ricardo; Edward Johnston, one of the fathers of modern calligraphy; Frank Pick, the British transport administrator who commissioned many icons of the London Underground's identi-ty; and his brother, the sculptor and typographer Eric Gill. Though his legacy is overshadowed by his controversial brother, MacDonald Gill was nevertheless a signicant and influential artist of his time. Today, his painted panel maps decorate the Palace of Westminster and Lindisfarne Castle, and the alphabet he designed in 1918 is still used on British military headstones. With a four-decade career spanning two world wars, the decline of the British Empire, and countless innovations in communications technology, his work takes on heightened historical importance, as it reflects the remarkable events and developments of his era. Drawing chiefly from family archives, MacDonald Gill: Charting a Life is the rst book to tell the story of this complex and talented man. Caroline Walker is an accredited lecturer for The Arts Society. The great-niece of MacDonald Gill, she has researched his life and work since 2006.

Naseby's rst visit to the island was in 1963 to handle a crisis in Colombo. Over the course of more than twenty visits to the island since, Naseby has been an ofcial observer at a number of presidential and general elections, witnessed the opening of the Victoria Dam as an ofcial guest, supported the Sri Lankan government and people through a civil war, and played a key role in the UK's aid response to the devastating tsunami of 2004. Indeed, a year later, the president of Sri Lanka presented Naseby with the nation's highest honor for non-nationals: the Sri Lanka Rathna, awarded for \"exceptional and outstanding service to the nation.\" This book is a powerful memoir that chronicles fty years of enduring friendship between a British politician and the people of Sri Lanka. The author's recollections offer commentary on the political landscape of a nation ravaged by civil war and explores its relation-ships with the western world. \"Naseby has been a long-standing friend to Sri Lanka.

With world population on the rise and countryside disappearing to urban sprawl and commercial agriculture, the sharing of urban space with nature is more important than ever. To strike the right balance, we have to preserve and increase the green and blue spaces in our cities and see and love the wildlife that we already have. One of the greenest capital cities in the world, in 2019 London was declared the world's rst National Park City. In Wild Neighbours , documentary and wildlife photographer Sarah Cheesbrough sets out to observe and create photographic portraits of the creatures of her home city of London.

In capturing the wildlife of her city, she gives us insight into London's natural world and inspires its conservation through love. \"Cheesbrough's stunning portraits of London wildlife are a joy to behold.

Intrigued by this incongruity, acclaimed London photographer Niki Gorick has gained unique access to cap-ture the day-to-day workings of these ancient buildings. In her explora-tion, she discovered a vibrant, diverse spiritual life stretching out into many faiths. This is a book about London and Londoners from a previously unexplored angle, revealing a rich mix of characters, traditions, and human-interest stories. From weddings, communions, evangelical studies, and carol services to Knights Templar investitures, sh dis-plays, Afghan music, and vicars wielding knives, the photographs show an extraordinary range of spiritual goings-on and charismatic per-sonalities. For the rst time, readers get to glimpse a side of London's Square Mile not dominated by money-making, where City workers try to connect to life's deeper meanings and where religious traditions and questions of faith are still very much alive.

The attacks took a brutal toll: Almost 19 thousand tons of bombs were dropped on the capital and nearly 30 thousand civilians were killed. The Blitz forever changed the landscape of the city, damaging iconic buildings like Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, and the Imperial War Museums. Whole neigh-borhoods were all but wiped out. In addition to transforming the city's physical landscape, the war brought social changes.

This is the story of John Harrison (1693-1776), the self-taught English clockmaker who dedicated his life to solving the ocean's longi-tude problem. From the end of the fteenth century, merchants, explorers, and adventurers took to the open seas in unprecedented numbers as worldwide trade increased. These journeys were hazardous not only because of the inherent dangers of the ocean but also because, once out of sight of land, sailors had no accurate means of knowing their exact position. Long-distance sea travel was so dangerous that, in 1714, the British Parliament offered a prize to anyone who could solve the problem. Inspired, Harrison designed and built the marine chronom-eter: the rst device to calculate longitude at sea. The chronometer quickly became a vital tool of maritime trade, revolutionizing sea travel and saving countless lives. John Harrison and the Quest for Longitude is the fascinating account of one man's quest to solve one of the greatest practical problems of his time. With sixty full-color images and technical drawings throughout, it sheds important new light on a fundamental piece of British mari-time and horological history.

It was then that the English fleet successfully defeated the invading Spanish Armada, which had been sent to overthrow Elizabeth. The portrait is arguably the most recognizable depiction of the Tudor queen. Still, it is also a complex, multi-layered repre-sentation of the iconography of Elizabeth I, as the \"Empresse of the world\" and the \"Virgin Queen.\" Each of the three surviving versions of the portrait includes symbolism that illustrates Elizabeth's victory. The painting, as an outstanding historical document, summarizes the hopes and aspirations of the state, and Elizabeth as its head, at a watershed moment of history. In The Armada Portrait , Christine Riding takes the reader on a journey through the painting's history, rendered possible thanks to the discoveries made during the most recent conser-vation work. The illustrated guide to the impressive \"Armada Portrait\" gives an overview of the context, creation, and signif-icance of the portrait, alongside an evaluation of Elizabeth's legacy.

Figureheads developed from an ancient tradition of decorating ships with painted eyes, carved gures, and animal heads. Vikings in northern Europe adorned the bows of their vessels with dragon heads, which were thought to help ships see their way through the sea. They are considered the only tangible evidence of the \"Great Age of Sail.\" But what other purposes did sailors believe gureheads served? What stories do these beautiful objects tell? And what do the different characters symbolize? Figureheads contains over fty examples of wooden carvings from the National Maritime Museum in London, home to the world's most extensive collection of gureheads. The illustrated guide explores themes surrounding these unique carvings from mythology and gen-der to politics and literature. For instance, superstitious crew members often lovingly cared for their gureheads, which were often the only female presence on board. Figureheads delves deeply into the history and contexts of gureheads and, by so doing, provides a fresh image of life at sea.

The history of women's activism in St. Louis began long before 1920, when Missouri ratied the Nineteenth Amendment and gave women the right to vote. Women have always been a fundamental\u2014but too often unfairly forgotten\u2014part of what made St. Louis a great American city. By taking a closer look at decades of St. Louis women from every race, class, and creed, a richer picture of the entire city's history begins to emerge.

Moon tells the stories of fty female pioneers with ties to St. Louis, from European- born settlers like Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bourgeois Chouteau to early-twentieth- century cookbook author Irma Rombauer and renowned activist poet Maya Angelou. Moon also uncovers histories of lesser-known gures who proved equally important to building the foundations of this city. Whether world-famous or not, each of the trailblazing women in this book faced a host of specic obstacles and restrictions in their chosen elds that existed solely because of their gender. Their victories were all hard won and well earned. Illustrated by St. Louis artist Rori! and published to coincide with the Missouri History Museum's exhibit Beyond the Ballot: St. Lou-is and Suffrage, this book is the only one of its kind.

Focusing rst on the turmoil of an imperfect world before turning to raging social concerns, the poems nally come to nd a refreshed sense of hope, offering spaces to pause and breathe in the world around us. First the poet addresses \"the limits of the containing air,\" the atmosphere of a world that moves along a journey ever-farther from whatever Eden it began in. He walks us through the fear and bewilder-ment, the dips and bumps, the guilt of gazing and desire along a path pointed away from paradise. These poems take in the deep\u2014even if unadmitted\u2014resentment at having to live and breathe in an uninvit-ing world, amid scorched earth, and in a human body that feels the burning of precariousness, anxiety, and grief. The second space calls us to breathe in the now, bringing attention to a troubled world where the atmosphere is lled with strongmen hungry for rivalry, with the stink of age-old inequalities, and where looming climate emergency and nuclear war hover over the waters. The poet nally leads us to green nature, to a space of freshness that somehow survives under threat. Here is the living flow of the senses, the wonders of art, and a renewed feeling of sublimity that thrills from earth to the heavens. Cal Bedient is professor emeritus at University of California, Los Angeles, is a founding editor of the New California Poetry series, and co-edits Lana Turner: A Journal of Poetry & Opinion .

He lives in Santa Monica, California.\"'What is a song without excess?' Bedient asks in his latest book of odd odes, eddying odysseys, antsy still lifes, and abstract memos on various acts of kindness, cruelty, panic, grief. Accom-panied under the 'standofsh stars' by Elvis and Eros, Rossini and Ceres, Billy Budd and Bobby Kennedy, the re- and flower-tongued voice of these poems\u2014 chthonic, muscular, debonair\u2014endeavors to overflow limits with lyric, while its elemental 'song with Rogue shadows' rebuffs ofcial national power and its tweeting twit-in-chief. Governed by thun - der and lightning and birds, by a gravitas of red, The Breathing Place suggests that beauty may be a seismic, even cosmic disorder.\"\u2014Andrew Zawacki, author of UNSUN : f/11 2C72%(5 80 Paper $17.95 / \u00a315.00 32(75< 288 Omnidawn Publishing, Inc. 2nd PROOF MARY JULIE NATHALIE KHANKAN Quiet Orient Riot Tracing the conception of a child through to her birth, Quiet Orient Riot addresses birth regimes and the politics of repro- duction, unspooling the many ways that liturgical commands and an intense demographic anxiety affect a journey towards moth-erhood. Through these poems, Nathalie Khankan considers what it means to bear a Palestinian child in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly with a pregnancy enabled through contingent access to Israel's sophisticated fertility treatment infrastructure. The poems confront questions of how to be a national vessel and to bear a body whose very creation is enabled by the pronatalist state, yet not recog-nized by it. While Quiet Orient Riot chronicles a journey that is specic and localized, the larger questions that emerge from these poems reach be-yond this particular story. The book asks questions of itself, wondering what kind of language may hold precarious life and what kind of poem may see an unborn body through emergency, diminishment, and into blossoming. Through the trials of pregnancy and birth, demographic and reli- gious imperatives, these poems are concerned with many kinds of wor-ship. They bow to a \"chirpy printed sound,\" \"what grows in the rubble,\" and \"the capacity for happiness despite visual evidence.\" Wherever you look, there are water holes for the thirsty and a grove of \"little justices.\" Nathalie Khankan teaches Arabic language and literature in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and she is the founding director of the Danish House in Palestine. Her work has previously appeared in the Berkeley Poetry Review , jubilat , and Crab Creek Review . She lives in San Francisco with her husband and daughters.\"An arresting debut collection, Khankan's Quiet Orient Riot is like no other book of poems. Truly original in its approach to the poem and to saying anything, it stages a revolution against the spiritual and actual reduction of a people. . . . The poems steadfastly resist metaphor as if to say, nothing can stand in for the thing itself, or as if to say the thing itself stripped of artice needs no new dress-ing. Khankan's is a poetics of powerful imagistic nakedness. Here is where craft and urgency come together to create a voice that is both uncanny and iridescent. Here is where we're compelled to come together, not in chorus, but in guttural gesture. If we need any book of poems now, it's Quiet Orient Riot .\"\u2014Dawn Lundy Martin, author of Good Stock Strange Blood 2C72%(5 80 p. 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-1-63243-083-0 Paper $17.95 / \u00a315.00 32(75< Omnidawn Publishing, 2nd PROOF MARY JULIE CLAIRE MARIE STANCEK wyrd] bird In times fraught with ecological and individual loss, Claire Marie Stancek's wyrd] bird grapples with both the necessity and appar-ent impossibility of afrming mystical experience. It is at once a book-length lyric essay on the 12th-century German mystic Hildegard of Bingen, a dream journal, a fragmentary notebook, a collection of poems, and a scrapbook of photographic ephemera. Stancek follows Hildegard as she guides the poet through an underworld of climate catastrophe and political violence populated by literary, mythical, and historical gures from Milton's Eve to the biblical Satan to Keats's hand. The book deconstructs a Western tradition of good and evil by rereading, cross-questioning, and upsetting some of that tradition's central poetic texts. By refusing and confusing dualistic logic, wyrd] bird searches for an expression of visionary experience that remains rooted in the body, a mode of questioning that echoes out into further questioning, and a cry of elegiac loss that grips, stubbornly, onto love. \"The tremendous and multi-faceted range\u2014historical, thematic, formal\u2014of this book-length poem creates a new structure, one that might best be called a wander, through which we're led by Hildegard of Bingen and a constantly transforming and transformative host of birds. The birds become a way of interrogating corporality, their wings offering an anti-gravitational counterpoint to the round solidity of body. Haunted by recurrent characters\u2014shattered glass, a recent death, or simply the color green\u2014Stancek's language-machine cuts and splices normative syntax into sparkling patterns, juxtaposing clar-ity with a marvelous opacity, an opacity that gives her language reflec-tive properties.\"\u2014Cole Swensen, author of Gravesend Claire Marie Stancek is the author of two books of poetry, Oil Spell and MOUTHS . With Jane Gregory and Lyn Hejinian, she co-edits Nion Editions, a chapbook press. She lives in Oakland, California.\"wyrd] bird immerses us in a world of disproportionate amounts of pain and beauty. This book wants equity but won't settle for a pat response. Through intermittent states of dream, wake, and the in-between, along with a channeling of the medieval mystic Hildegard von Bingen, and a panoply of other writers (Marvell, Donne, Milton, Keats), wyrd] bird is dream journaling, resistance writing, chant and meditation; the work goes deep. Stancek has a careful, gorgeous eye and ear, and her lines will make you stop in your tracks. Words here are frenetic, alive and 'honey red-burn-ing.' Stancek asks, 'What would it mean to write an utterly embodied book?'

In This Red Metropolis What Remains , Leia Penina Wilson composes a mysteriously stark and playful pop-surreal romp through a mythic apocalypse. Dropping in and out of this mystic narrative are voices of characters who are trying to survive and to rec-oncile their own belonging. These poems reckon with what happens in the aftermath of brutal- ity, questioning what anyone can or should do after tragedy, question-ing everything until they begin to break down even their own author-ity. The landscape in the world of This Red Metropolis What Remains is itself deeply unsettled. Each form varies and reflects an endless trans-formation of embodiment and interrogation. These poems ask what can be recovered, if anything, through an uninterrupted interrogation of memory, category, and language and with an unbroken attention to the speaker's own power. Creating shifting architecture and landscape that reveals both the disintegration of cultural time and the eternity of interior time, confession and lyric wrap both speaker and listener together. Leia Penina Wilson is the author of i built a boat with all the towels in your closet (and will let you drown) and Splinters are Children of Wood . Her work has appeared in Denver Quarterly , Dream Pop Press , and Split Lip . She is an afakasi Samoan poet from the Midwest, and she lives in Pittsburgh, PA.\"I enjoyed the fabular vibe of This Red Me- tropolis What Remains, the way that ex- acting loss and neon pleasures combine with a light yet complex tone. '[I] want to be wild / in the wilderness,' exclaims the narrator-poet, as a centaur canters past or stamps its hoof in sudden anger. And what would it be to step over the bound-ary of 'red salt'? How do 'menace' and 'extinction' speak to each other across zones of human and animal comfort, or desire? Wilson conjures her magic as a poet in service of questions that, them-selves, form during the act of reading itself. All of this feels quite generous and free, optimistic, while at the same time speaking to survival. How 'something must come' no matter how 'beastly' the experience is.\" \u2014Bhanu Kapil, author of How to Wash a Heart 2C72%(5 168 p. 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-1-63243-085-4 Paper $17.95 / \u00a315.00 32(75< Omnidawn Publishing, Inc. 291 3rd PROOF MARY JULIE MAW SHEIN WIN Storage Unit for the Spirit House With sharp focus and startling language, the poems in Maw Shein Win's second book, Storage Unit for the Spirit House , look through physical objects to glimpse the ephemeral, the material, and the immaterial. Vinyl records, felt wolverines, a belt used to punish children, pain pills, and \"show dogs with bejeweled col-lars\" crowd into Win's real and imagined storage units. Nats, Buddhist animist deities from her family's homeland of Burma, haunt the book's six sections. The nats, almost all of whom were once humans who died violently, inhabit the storage units and hover around objects while forgotten children sleep under Mylar blankets and daughters try to see through the haze of a father's cigarette smoke. Assemblages of both earthly and noncorporeal possessions throughout the collection become resonant and alive, and Win must summon \"a circle of drums and copper bells\" to appease the nats who have moved into a long-ago family house. This careful curation of un-likely objects and images becomes an act of ritual collection that uses language to interrogate how pain in life can transform someone into a nat or a siren that lives on. Restrained lines request our imagination as we move with the poet through haunted spaces and the objects that inhabit them. Maw Shein Win is the author of Invisible Gifts: Poems and her chapbooks in- clude Ruins of a glittering palace and Score and Bone . Maw was the inaugural poet laureate of El Cerrito (2016-18). She lives and teaches in the San Francisco Bay Area.\"These spare poems are haunted. With a blown-up heart, Win writes about pos- sessions and flashes that hark back like ghosts to our befores. In Storage Unit for the Spirit House , prisons, tombs, portals, bottles, storage units are memorials.

In The Lower East Side Tenement Reclamation Association , David Rothman weaves a rich story about real estate, family, and memory. Daniel, the protagonist, is haunted by the memories of his childhood experiences in his grandmother's apartment, a home that he desper-ately wants to inhabit. One day he discovers a hidden relic on Rivington Street: a tenement reclamation ofce run by an eccentric centenarian named Hannah. When Daniel inquires about the chances of re-claiming his grandmother's old tenement, Hannah is not impressed. \"Things don't work like that, you rude, young schlub!\" And so begins Daniel's journey to take back his past and to secure an affordable space for his family in downtown Manhattan. This is a journey full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and an ending that would make even the most thick-skinned New York real estate agent shake. The Lower East Side Tenement Reclamation Association is the winner of the Omnidawn Fabulist Fiction Novelette Prize, selected by Meg Ellison. David Rothman teaches writing for the City University of New York, and he has had short stories published Glimmer Train , Hybrido , the Piltdown Review , and Newtown Literary , among others. He is the drummer for the NYC-based band, The Edukators, and is a proud resident of Jackson Heights, Queens (and has little or no interest in reclaiming his actual grandparents' tenement on the Lower East Side).\"The Lower East Side Tenement Reclama- tion Association is a brilliantly-written work of magical ction in which both contemporary New York and the Jewish immigrant experience come alive. I loved Daniel, who wants a Manhattan apart - ment in the most desperate way, his sensible wife Julie, and their wise little girl, Hannah. The book is both moving and comic.\"\u2014Phyllis Smith, author of I am Livia \"Rothman's novel lands readers in a magi- cal New York City, where portals and keys lead to wondrous places.

Di Piero's prose writ- ings, Fat displays the range and intensity that caused Poetry mag - azine to call him \"probably the most consistently compelling and idiosyncratic prose writer among contemporary American poets.\" Ranging from a response to 9/11 and reflections on fatherhood, food, and music, to reconsiderations of Robert Browning, James Schuyler, and other poets, to reviews of old master artists like Rembrandt and Bellini as well as modern gures like Bill Traylor and Robert Map-plethorpe, these pieces provoke and tease out the meanings of contem-porary life and the legacies of the past.

Working with a number of different composers, Browne has ranged widely across forms; what we discover here are lyrics, song cycles, songs for children, excerpts from libretti\u2014some of them in free verse, some of them formal\u2014as well as poems that, while not written to be part of specic musical works, were nonetheless written with music in mind or under the influence of particular works. The result is a volume that sits comfortably between poetry and music, lyrical and rhythmic and memorable. Michael Dennis Browne was born in England, of mostly Irish ancestry, in 1940, and came to the United States in 1965.

Added to these themes is some-thing new: Poems written in response to symptoms of late onset PTSD. Though Green's Coast Guard service in Vietnam ended in the fall of 1969, memories have returned recently in vivid, disturbing details, am-plied by the haunting knowledge that civilians in Southeast Asia are still, today, suffering death and injury from unexploded ordnance left over from that war. A powerful collection that reminds us that our past is always with us, even as we attend carefully to the present, Disturbing the Light is a masterwork from a poet at the height of his powers.

Through meticulous historical research and hours of interviews conducted with Balada over six years, biographer Juan Francisco de Dios has produced a unique portrait of the making of an artist. His imaginative eye for detail recreates a sequence of fasci-nating episodes in social history. We meet adolescent Balada at school, the only boy in a class of girls, view his suffering as a military conscript in the mountains, witness behind-the-scenes conflicts and rivalries in the production of his opera in Barcelona, and get a glimpse of a more settled life when he became an educator of musicians-to-be at Carne-gie Mellon University. Throughout, Francisco de Dios delivers riveting descriptions of Balada's music and development as a composer. This biography is an essential contribution to the understanding of a musi-cian who spans continents and the contemporary history and culture of Spain and the United States.

The poet, Daniel M. Becker, has been a physician for over thirty years, working in general medicine, geriatric clinics, and addiction clinics, supervising medical students and residents, and more. With poems such as \"Goals of Care,\" \"Before Flu Season,\" and \"Advance Directives,\" 2nd Chance covers the full spectrum of medical care\u2014birth, death, and all the surprising moments in between. Writ-ten with warmth and empathy for the human condition, these poems attempt to understand, share, and honor what both patients and medical professionals experience. Serious matters are approached with intelligence, humility, and humor, making this collection an affecting entry into the growing eld of medical poetry. \"Becker's 2nd Chance gives its readers two simultaneous chances\u2014 to perceive at once the acutely physical and the expansively spiritual. Like his doctor-poet predecessor William Carlos Williams, Becker studies 'where to draw the line / between uncertainty and mystery,' listening often with a stethoscope, often teaching others to listen. . . . The frank, reassuring voice of these poems ranges with ease from the somatic to the ecstatic and back. 'Among the Deep Listeners in Deep Listening 101' suggests: 'Look around, listen up: there are worlds beyond our thresholds. / / During the eld trip inside the sound free chamber: / those strangers pounding at the door? / Heart beats.'\" \u2014Debra Nystrom Daniel Becker practices and teaches internal medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.\"Becker's 2nd Chance is harrowing in its examination of life and death\u2014or more precisely, that space in between the two. . . .

Similarly, Swale looks outward to the natural world and directs its focus inward to the land- scape of the mind. The past presses in like a thick mist: plundering colonial ships and the cracking edges of empire coincide with contem-porary scenes and personal erosions and failures. Alongside humans are animals both living and extinct: manatees, sea turtles, and whales; roaming bears, horses, and lambs; and the flightless dodo and Steller's sea cow, gone for centuries. What happens when the mind eclipses what the body sees, and neither can be trusted\u2014when demarcations between land and water blur, and one's sense of self begins to recede? Swale interrogates the violence of colonialism and its reverber- ations over time, as well as the extinction and the rapid decline of animal species. By turns tidal and cloistered, Swale speaks of science, reliquaries, and lapis lazuli, traversing forests, seascapes, and meadows. Here, the ocean becomes a eld, a medieval tapestry transforms into a space that can be entered, and the body is fleshless, struck through with light. The speaker of these poems is ultimately unxed\u2014and with that comes both imaginative possibility and a personal unmooring. In poems that cast and recast the interior self in different guises\u2014from the perpetually off-kilter Alice to the divergent voices of the shorn lamb and predatory foxhound\u2014an unsettling anxiety grows starker, along with the wish for repair.

Accompa-nied by two travelling companions, Buchanan winds her way from Hanoi in the north to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, in the south. Driving through the spectacular scenery of Vietnam and Laos, she encounters locations from the Truong Son mountains, the Phong Nha Caves, ancient citadels and Confucian temples, to the Khmer temple of Wat Phu at the western-most point of the Trail in Laos. Buchanan records her interactions\u2014both scheduled and sponta- neous\u2014with those who experienced the Vietnam War rsthand, and these conversations with combatants and civilians provide new per-spectives on the War. She listens to the women who defended the Trail roads against the greatest bombing campaign in modern times, walks through mineelds with the demolition teams hunting for unexploded ordnance, and meets American veterans who have returned to Viet-nam with an urge to \"do something.\" Buchanan weaves informative, and often humorous, tales from her journey with excerpts from the accounts of others, situating the locations she visits in their historical and political context. On the Ho Chi Minh Trail brings together geogra - phy, history, and personal accounts to readdress the culture of indif-ference to the War, bringing to light the scale of the tragedy, its lasting legacies, and our memory of it.

Wang's debut collection of short stories interrogates personal and political events set against the backdrop of China that are both real and perceived, imagined and speculative. Wang plunges us into the ctional Chinese village of Xinchun and beyond to explore themes of tradition, family, modernity, and immigration in a country grappling with its modern identity. Violence enters the pastoral when Chinese villagers are flung down a well by Japanese soldiers and forced to abandon their crops and families to work in the coal mines; a tugboat driver dredges up something more than garbage polluting the Suzhou River; and rural and urban landscapes are pitted against each other when young villagers are promised high-paying work in the city but face violent persecution instead. In this world where China has regressed back to its imperial days, we meet an emperor who demands total servitude and swift punishment for attempts at revolution, and in another story, we follow a father who immigrates to the United States for a better life and loses everything in a tragic accident\u2014aside from his estranged son\u2014with whom he stubbornly refuses to make amends. Further News of Defeat is rich with characters who have known strug- gle and defeat and who nd themselves locked in pivotal moments of Chinese history\u2014such as World War II and the Tiananmen Square massacre\u2014as they face losses of the highest order and still nd cause for revival. Further News of Defeat is the winner of the 2019 Autumn House Press Fiction Prize. Michael X.

Incorporating experiences of food preparation, childrearing, and childbearing, the book begins with a section of po-ems that re-imagine recipes from one of the earliest cookbooks by an African-American woman: Mrs. Malinda Russell's A Domestic Cookbook . Mrs. Russell's voice as a nineteenth-century chef is joined in conversa-tion with a contemporary amateur cook in poetic recipes that take the form of soft and formal sonnets, introspective and historical lyric, and found poems. In the second section, the poet explores black maternal death and the harrowing circumstances surrounding birth for women of color in the United States. Even while confronting the dangers and tragedies of contempo- rary black life, Sherrard creates hopeful projections of the future. She imagines an afterlife in which souls of black mothers who have died in childbirth get to travel into space with the reluctant help of the as-trophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and she positions a doula as a gure of salvation who intervenes and advocates for black mothers, chal-lenging the dehumanizing practices of early obstetrics, genetics, and pseudo-science. Throughout Grimoire , Sherrard explores the precarity of black mothering over the last two centuries and the creative and ingenuous modes of human survival. Cherene Sherrard is the Sally Mead Hands-Bascom Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is the author of Portraits of the New Negro Woman: Visual and Literary Culture in the Harlem Renaissance and Dorothy West's Paradise: A Biography of Class and Color , and her debut poetry collection, Vixen , was published in 2017.

RANDAL O'WAIN Hallelujah Station and Other Stories MRandal O'Wain's debut short story collection, Hallelujah Station and Other Stories , introduces readers to a wide and diverse cast of characters struggling with and responding to change and loss. These gritty and poignant stories follow the tragic parts of life, the pieces that may neither start nor end in comfortable resolution and the pieces that make up complex realities. In the rst story, a former drug dealer reflects on a life-changing decision he made years ago that ended up hurting the person he most wanted to protect. Later in the collection, we meet a would-be robber who turns out, in strange ways, to be the hero. O'Wain's characters are often deeply flawed or totally lost, but in each instance, these traits serve to reveal the characters as real, compassionate, and, ultimately, human. Sprinkled with humor and heartache, O'Wain's stories bring us into contact with the curious, the tragic, and the authentic. \"O'Wain triumphantly brings salvation to the wrong side of the tracks. These stories of outsiders and addicts are thick with difculty and everyday struggles, but with O'Wain, they transcend.

The appendix, pinky toes, tonsils, male nipples, wisdom teeth, and coccyx are starting points through which Wiley explores exaltation, eroticism, grief, and desire. Using the slow evolution and odd disin-tegration of vestigial organs to enter the braided stories of the lives we establish for ourselves, the people we grieve, and the mysteries of youth, memory, and longing, Wiley's lens is deeply feminist and com-passionate. Turning to these mysterious anatomical remnants, she nds insight into the lingering questions of loss and the nagging sensations of being incomplete. For instance, in considering the appendix, Wiley nds herself working through her grief after the loss of her father, a sensation that again resurfaces in the face of the moon as she looks to the sky. Testing the boundaries of genre and ghting to expand the limits of perception, the stylized essays of Skull Cathedral embrace the strangeness of life through the lingering peculiarities of the human body. Skull Cathedral , Wiley's second book of nonction, won the 2019 Autumn House Press Nonction Prize.

She is the author of Antlers in Space and Other Common Phenomena , and her work has appeared in literary magazines including the American Literary Review , Terrain.org , . \"Hungry, ascetic, erotic, and haunted, Skull Cathedral moves from essay to essay as if from one dream to the next, testing what it means to be attached to a body, to beauty, to love. There isn't a sentence here that isn't in awe of consciousness and the cold, clear ache of being alive. Wiley is a writer who takes no moment for granted, and maybe that's why perception here is so intensied, from a strand of hair in an infant's hand to a stranger's lipstick left behind on a coffee cup. This is life on the brink, con-fronting the inescapable fact that all of us die and everything goes.

Powell was a leading gure in the development of jazz, but throughout his life, he also faced struggles with police brutality, harassment, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. In this collec-tion, makalani bandele explores Powell's life through a blend of both formal and free verse persona poems. These poems are multivocal, with the speaker often embodying Powell himself and sometimes a close friend or family member, the spectator of a performance, or a fellow musician. While the book follows the narrative of Powell's life, the poems are experimental in form and presentation. Playing with, reinventing, and restructuring poetic form, bandele draws on blues and jazz music theory to serve as a basis for much of the work's construction. He uses language to recreate the experience of music itself, and his poetry in-cludes a multitude of references and allusion to music lyrics and other poems. As the book recounts Powell's life, it also explores how black genius has encountered, struggled against, and developed mechanisms to cope with white supremacy in the United States. under the aegis of a winged mind won the 2019 Autumn House Press Poetry Prize. makalani bandele is an MFA candidate at the University of Kentucky and an Affrilachian Poets and Cave Canem fellow.

Jeffrey Zamostny is associate professor of Spanish at the University of West Georgia and coeditor, with Susan Larson, of Kiosk Literature of Silver Age Spain: Modernity and Mass Culture . Set in early twentieth-century Spain, Hidden Path is a lyrical coming-of-age novel told from the perspective of a painter who struggles to nd her way with art and with the women she loved. The novel is narrated in the rst-person, following Mar\u00eda Luisa as she reflects on her life from the turn of the twentieth century through the outset of the Sec - ond Spanish Republic (1931-39). She recalls growing from an imaginative tomboy into a docile wife and mother before claiming her independence as a portrait painter in Madrid's bohemian and queer circles. Along the way, she introduces us to a lively cast of charac - ters who both hinder and encourage her efforts to blaze her own path. The poetic and sensuous language of Mar\u00eda Luisa's private reveries comingles with agile dialogue as the protagonist leads us through her life. Best known in Spain as a writer of children's literature, Elena Fort\u00fan left this manuscript unpublished at the time of her death in 1952, as its semi-autobiographical content risked provoking homophobic backlash under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The rst Spanish edition appeared in 2016 and was hailed as Fort\u00fan's adult masterpiece, a previously unknown complement to her children's saga Celia and Her World . This edition, with Jef - frey Zamostny's sensitive and nuanced translation, marks the novel's rst time appearing in any language aside from Spanish; it is also the rst of Fort\u00fan's works to appear in English. With an in - sightful foreword by scholar Nuria Cap - devila-Arg\u00fcelles, this volume will be an influential contribution to women's studies, LGBT histories, and Spanish literature and culture.

Touching on matters such as marriage, child-rearing, and caregiving for her mother and her earth, Kelley's poems betray an unabashed affection for big words and small children. As a journalist, she has heard and told hundreds of stories, and like all reporters, values facts and the psychological heft behind them. Her mind catches on shiny facts and phrases that she gathers in combinations that can surprise, delight, and inform. Both reverent and irreverent, but always aiming for accuracy and empathy, Kelley explores the darkest corners, then lifts her eyes high. The poems in Rise Wildly touch on stories from the front row seat of Kelley's life, especially in her role as caregiver. Written with rever-ence for the vicissitudes of being a mother, wife, and daughter, Rise Wildly touches on it all: birth, childhood, middle age, old age, death, and their epic combinations. Musings on fact, ction, music, nature, and family are relayed with humor, grief, joy, and adoration. \"Throughout Rise Wildly , Kelley's elixir of 'Vitamin Awe' (the apt title of one of her poems) imbues dailiness with the magic of attention. Kelley's deceptively simple questions and instructions bring us to our senses: 'Count how often each year you let rain fall on your face.'

It examines the daily minutiae of caregiving, both the tender and the distasteful, that lend startling poignancy to unbearable hard-ship. Frannie Lindsay's poems chronicle how these challenges shock both self and God, dismantling that spiritual partnership and creating a new one that seems at rst a temporary refuge, but is later revealed to be sturdy and permanent. This collection explores the ways in which intimacy becomes at once tender and gritty in the face of loss. These poems investigate how we remember, and how we begin the patient reshaping of the bereft self. The Snow's Wife reaches beyond the sorrow of the poems' speaker and includes the reader in the difcult, loving acceptance of mortality. Unafraid to look beyond the sentimentality of grief, Lindsay draws an unflinching and intimate portrait of a conflicted yet tender relation-ship. Illustrating the strain that an expected death can place upon a marriage, and the myriad and surprising ways in which such strain ex-pands the heart, The Snow's Wife examines the crises of faith that arise naturally during intimate end-of-life caregiving. Frannie Lindsay 's previous volumes include If Mercy, Our Vanishing, Mayweed, Lamb , and Where She Always Was . Her work has appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the American Poetry Review, the Yale Review, Field, Plume, Salamander , and in The Best American Poetry 2014 .

In contrast to the infamous violence and rage that greeted forced school busing within the city in the 1970s, the work of METCO has quietly and calmly pro - moted school integration. But how has this program affected the lives of its graduates? Would they choose to par - ticipate if they had it to do over again? Would they place their own children on the bus to suburbia? In The Other Boston Busing Story, sixty-ve METCO gradu - ates who are now adults answer those questions and more, vividly recalling their own stories and assessing the ben - ets and hardships of crossing racial and class lines on their way to school. As courts and policymakers today are forcing the abandonment of desegrega - tion, this book offers an accessible and moving account of a rare program that, despite serious challenges, provides a practical remedy for the persistent in - equalities in American education.

In 2000, he was made a comendador da Ordem do Cruzeiro do Sul , Brazil's highest award for foreigners, in recognition of his contributions to Brazilian history.In Blood and Boundaries , Stuart B. Schwartz takes us to late medieval Latin America to show how Spain and Portugal's policies of exclusion and dis - crimination based on religious origins and genealogy were transferred to their colonies in Latin America. Rather than concentrating on the three principal divisions of colonial society\u2014Indians, Europeans, and people of African ori - gins\u2014as is common in studies of these colonial societies, Schwartz examines the three minority groups of moriscos, conversos, and mestizos. Muslim and Jewish converts and their descendants, he shows, posed a special problem for colonial society: they were feared and distrusted as peoples considered eth - nically distinct, but at the same time their conversion to Christianity seemed to violate stable social categories and identities. This led to the creation of \"cleanliness of blood\" regulations that explicitly discriminated against con - verts. Eventually, Schwartz shows, those regulations were extended to control the subject indigenous and enslaved African populations, and over time, ap - plied to the growing numbers of mes - tizos, peoples of mixed ethnic origins. Despite the efforts of civil, and church, and state institutions to regulate, den - igrate, and exclude, members of these affected groups often found legal and practical means to ignore, circumvent, or challenge the efforts to categorize and exclude them, creating in the process the dynamic societies of Lat - in America that emerged in the nine - teenth century.Blood and Boundaries The Limits of Religious and Racial Exclusion in Early Modern Latin America STUART B.

A merchant, banker, and court nancier, a scholar versed in both Jewish and Christian writings, a preach - er and exegete, a prominent political actor in royal entourages and Jewish communities, Abravanel was one of the greatest leaders and thinkers of Iberi - an Jewry in the aftermath of the expul - sion of 1492. This book, the rst new intellectual biography of Abravanel in twenty years, depicts his life in three cultural milieus\u2014Portugal, Castile, and post-expulsion Italy\u2014and analyzes his major literary accomplishments in each period. Abravanel was a tradition - alist with innovative ideas, a man with one foot in the Middle Ages and the other in the Renaissance. An erudite scholar, author of a monumental exe - getical opus that is still studied today, and an avid book collector, he was a transitional gure, dened by an age of contradictions. Yet, it is these very con - tradictions that make him such an im - portant personality for understanding the dawn of Jewish modernity.Don Isaac Abravanel An Intellectual Biography CEDRIC COHEN-SKALLI Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry NOVEMBER 256 p. 6 x 9 JULIE PETER CLARK Churchill's Britain From the Antrim Coast to the Isle of Wight More than half a century after his death, Winston Churchill, the most signicant British statesman of the twentieth cen-tury, continues to intrigue us. Peter Clark's book, however, is not merely another Churchill biography. Churchill's Britain takes us on a geographical journey through Churchill's life, leading us in Churchill's footsteps through locations in Britain and Ireland that are tied to key aspects of his biography. Some are familiar\u2014Blenheim Palace, where he was born; Chartwell, his beloved house in the coun-try; and the Cabinet War Rooms, where he planned the campaigns of World War II. But we also are taken to his schools, his parliamen-tary constituencies, locations of famous speeches, the place where he started to paint, the tobacco shop where he bought his cigars, and the graves of his family and close friends. Clark brings us close to the statesman Churchill by visiting sites that were important to the story of his long life, from the site where his father proposed to his American mother on the Isle of Wight to his grave in a country churchyard in Oxfordshire. Designed as a gazetteer with helpful regional maps, Churchill's Britain can be dipped into, con-sulted by the traveler on a Churchill tour of Britain, or read straight through\u2014and no matter how it's read, it will deliver fresh insights into this extraordinary man.

In this rst English-language biography, R\u00fcdiger G\u00f6rner depicts the artist in all his fascinating and contradictory complexity. He traces Kokoschka's path from b\u00eate noire of the bour - geoisie and \"hunger artist\" who had to flee the Nazis to a wealthy and cosmopolitan political and critical artist who played a signicant role in shaping the European art scene of the twentieth century and whose relevance is undiminished to this day. In Kokoschka: A Life in Art , G\u00f6rner emphasizes the artist's versatili - ty. Kokoschka, although best known for his painting, was more than a visual artist: his achievements as a playwright, essayist, and poet bear witness to a remarkable literary talent. Music, too, played a central role in his work, and a passion for teaching led him to establish in 1953 the School of Seeing, an unconventional art school intended to revive humanist ideals in the horric aftermath of war. This biog - raphy shows brilliantly how all the pieces of Kokoschka's disparate interests and achievements cohered in the richly creative life of a singular artist.

It's perhaps not surprising, therefore, that when they ruled Crete, the Greeks called it \"Megal\u00f3nisos\" or the \"Great Island.\" Yet the island has been ruled for much of its history by foreign invaders\u2014including Mycenaeans, Dorians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Venetians, Ottoman Turks, and, briefly, the Third Reich. In A History of Crete , Chris Moorey explores the history of the Great Island from mythological Crete until today and sheds light on how the Cretans themselves have interacted with their conquerors. A History of Crete portrays the Cretans as erce lovers of freedom who worked around and with the influence of foreign rule on their cul - ture. In an engaging and lively style, Moorey emphasizes and contrasts two periods at either end of these three thousand years of domination: the dazzling apogee of the Minoan civilization from the Bronze Age, representing the rst advanced civilization in Europe, and the brief period of autonomy before union with Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century. A History of Crete shows how the history of the contested island affected its people and made them to the Cretans of today. Chris Moorey is a writer, historian, and the author of A Glimpse of Heaven . He has lived in Crete for over twenty years.\"Moorey, a writer and independent his - torian, manages to cover the entirety of Crete's long history, from the prehistoric era to the 20th century, ending with a succinct account of the island today. . . .

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the city that is now Tokyo was a sprawling shing town by the bay named Edo. Earlier still, in the Middle Ages, it was Edojuku, an outpost overlooking farmlands. And thousands of years ago, its mudflats and marshes were home to ele-phants, deer, and marine life. In this compact history, Jonathan Clements traces Tokyo's fasci- nating story from the rst forest clearances and the samurai wars to the hedonistic \"floating world\" of the last years of the Shogunate. He illuminates the Tokyo of the twentieth century with its destruction and redevelopment, boom and bust without forgoing the thousand years of history that have led to the Eastern Capital as we know it. Tokyo is so entwined with the history of Japan that it can be hard to separate them, and A Short History of Tokyo tells both the story of the city itself and offers insight into Tokyo's position at the nexus of power and peo-ple that has made the city crucial to the events of the whole country.

It is also a story that unites Christianity and Islam\u2014two faiths that have often been at odds with each other. The accounts of the Nativity given by the Evangelists Luke and Matthew nd their parallels in Surahs 3 and 19 of the Qur'an, which take up the Annunciation to Mary, the Incarnation from the Holy Spirit, and the Nativity. Christmas and the Qur'an is a sensitive and precise analysis of the Christmas story as it appears in the Gospels and the Qur'an. Karl-Josef Kuschel presents both scriptures in a convincing comparative exege-sis and reveals startling similarities as well as signicant differences. Kuschel explores how Christians and Muslims read these texts and reveals an intertwining legacy that serves as a base for greater under-standing. Without leaving the realm of theology, Kuschel approaches his analysis in a theocentric way by emphasizing the shared belief that God is almighty, which, he argues, can act as a healing suture between Christianity and Islam. Christmas and the Qur'an gives the reader the chance to remember the message of hope that the birth of Jesus brings and invites the reader to a dialogue between Muslims and Christians. Karl-Josef Kuschel is professor emeritus of Catholic theology at the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany. His many books include Born Before All Time?: The Dispute over Christ's Origin and Laughter: A Theological Reflection. \"The depiction of Jesus and indeed of Mary in the Qur'an is a subject of great importance for a more intelligent dialogue between Islam and the Christian tradition.

The year 2021 will mark the centennial of Kropotkin's death, which this book commemorates through the rst-ever English edition of his Siberian diaries. Aged nineteen and freshly graduated at the top of his class from a prestigious military academy, Kropotkin decided to be posted to the distant backwater of Siberia, to the shock of his friends and family. There, he idealistically pursued political reforms and also participated in various ground-breaking geographic surveys, keeping a diary that recorded his experiences. Ten years later, after tenuously living a dou-ble life in the royal court and radical circles, the Tsarist Secret Police arrested him in St. Petersburg and seized his papers, including these Siberian diaries. This arrest, and his dramatic escape from prison, would spark the beginning of his reputation as one of the most famous anarchists ever. He would then spend forty years in exile before re-turning to revolutionary Russia where he would become increasingly critical of the Bolsheviks. First published posthumously in 1923 in Russia, Kropotkin's Sibe- rian diaries take us on his ve-year journey from St. Petersburg to Si-beria, via Moscow, Kaluga, Chita, and Irkutsk. These pages, published here for the rst time in English, immerse us in Kropotkin's develop-ment as a brilliant scientist as he explored almost impassable terrain while also giving us a clear picture of his early political and philosophi-cal thinking at a crucial moment in Russian history. Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921) was a renowned Russian scientist, anarchist philosopher, and activist who lectured across Europe and North America and published widely.

In seeking answers to this question over several decades, social mobilizations have been assembled and new political and legal frameworks promoted. New interpretations and political articulations of the right to the city, especially those that have emerged since the end of the 2000s, encour-age us to view it through the lens of identity politics. They propose that attention should be given to the diversity of the social groups that live in urban environments, whose voice and agency must be recognized in the construction of the city in the interests of equality and social justice. Addressing these issues involves recognizing and valuing subjects that have historically been marginalized in the construction of urban space, both physical and symbolic. We must bear in mind that the city materializes through the practices of the groups that inhabit it, in short, how their daily life takes shape\u2014and is therefore experienced in a different ways by them. Advancing Urban Rights will help both con-cerned citizens and policy makers identify and analyze redistribution and recognition policies, institutional change, and so-cial production of the city in an increasingly urban world.

Is the desertication of the planet, driven by state and corporate authority, the nal horizon of history? Is the dystopian future implied by the systemic degradation of nature and society inescapable? From mar-ginal activist groups to governments and interstate organizations, all appear to be concerned with what the future of our shared world will look like. Yet even amid the ongoing global crisis caused by capitalism, the potential of a different, radically rooted future has also appeared. Common Futures explores the global emergence of twenty-rst- century social movements, opposed to capitalism and state authority. These movements, Yavor Tarinski and Alexandros Schismenos show, transcend traditional political forms of organization and try to form autonomous networks premised on direct democracy and solidarity. The authors identify the importance of grassroots movements, which can bring radical change and create a more democratic and ecological future. Common Futures examines the social and political roots of the environmental crisis and the relationship between ecology and di-rect democracy. But Tarinski and Schismenos go beyond the analysis of crises, contemporary struggles, and social movements: They also clarify the conditions for the re-creation of free public time and space and point to practical steps that we can take to alleviate the problems of our future.

Upon the breakdown of negotiations, the police launched a violent crackdown as a re mysteriously broke out inside the center and racist chants were hurled by spectators on the street. It was a heavily mediatized flashpoint in the Canadian civil rights movement and the international Black Power struggle that would send shockwaves as far as the Caribbean. Half a century later, we continue to grapple with the legacies of this watershed moment in light of current resistance move-ments such as Black Lives Matter, calls for reparations, or Rhodes Must Fall. How is the Sir George Williams \"affair\" remembered, forgotten, or contested? How is blackness included or occluded in decolonizing dialogues? The Fire That Time addresses those questions while it commemo- rates and reflects upon the transnational resonances of Black protest and radical student movements. Through several thoughtful essays, scholars examine the unnished business of decolonization and its re-lationship to questions of pedagogy, institutional life and culture, and ongoing discussions about race and racism.

According to Trudeau, he and his Liberals have brought Canada back after the disastrous Conservative government under Stephen Harper. In House of Mirrors , Yves Engler asks probing questions and demonstrates that the opposite is true: Trudeau, he argues, has largely continued Harper's foreign policy. House of Mirrors outlines how Trudeau's government has expanded the military while ignoring international efforts to restrict nuclear weapons proliferation. The Liberals, Engler shows, have launched an unprecedented effort to overthrow Venezuela's government while siding with an assortment of reactionary governments. Flouting their climate commitments, the Trudeau government also failed to follow through on its promise to rein in Canada's controversial mining sector. With heavily documented analysis, House of Mirrors gives insight into the Liberals' rhetorical skills that whitewash their pro-corporate and conservative policies with progressive slogans.

In his eleventh book, Yves Engler, the prolic author and critic of Canadian politics, exposes the reality of Canadian wars, repression, and mili - tary culture despite the mythologies of Canada as an agent for international peacekeeping and humanitarianism. Originating as a British force that brutally dispossessed First Nations, the Canadian Forces regularly quelled la - bor unrest in the decades after Confed - eration. It would go on to participate in military occupations or invasions in Sudan, South Africa, Europe, Korea, Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, and Libya, as well as Canadian gunboat diplomacy and UN deployments that have ousted elected governments. As the federal government department with by far the greatest budget, staff, PR machine, and intelligence-gathering capacities, the Canadian military is a key developer of military technology, including chem - ical, biological, and nuclear weapons.

JIROUS End of the World Poetry and Prose Translated by Paul Wilson, Justin Quinn, and Timothy West Sometimes called the Czech Bukowski, and more widely known by the epithet \"Magor\" (which translates roughly to \"fool\" or \"madman\"), Ivan M. Jirous was one of the most signicant g- ures in the Czechoslovak cultural underground of the 1960s through the '80s. Although trained as an art historian and famed for his poetry, Jirous was convinced that it was actually rock and roll music that held the greatest potential to enact change under the repressive regime of communist Czechoslovakia. He designated himself as the artistic director of the dissident rock band The Plastic People of the Universe, legendary for psychedelic music that was heavily influenced by noncon-formist Western acts like Frank Zappa and The Velvet Underground. Alongside other gures from the musical underground, Jirous was arrested in 1976\u2014the second of ve prison sentences he would serve for his dissent\u2014which helped bring about the landmark civil rights initiative known as Charter 77. In the wake of 1989's Velvet Revolution, V\u00e1clav Havel\u2014the rst president of the Czech Republic\u2014was to say that Jirous and his unwavering commitment to liberation played \"no small part\" in casting off the yoke of Soviet oppression. End of the World is the rst major collection in English of the works of this legendary Czech \"madman.\" Although nicknamed for his aggressive and rebellious behavior, Jirous's writings reveal a rened, sophisticated, and even tender sensibility. Translated in part by Paul Wilson, an original member of the Plastic People, the book gathers his poems and letters from prison, as well as his book-length prose work, The True Story of the Plastic People, alongside critical essays on Jirous's life and work. End of the World is an ideal introduction to the raucous writer whom playwright Tom Stoppard referred to as one of the most interest-ing personalities in modern Czech history. Ivan M. Jirous (1944 -2011) was a Czech dissident, critic, essayist, poet, and artistic director of The Plastic People of the Universe.Modern Czech Classics NOVEMBER 400 p. 35 halftones 6 x 8 ISBN-13: 978-80-246-4527-8 Paper $25.00 / \u00a320.00 MUSIC POETRY CZE/SVK 334 Press, Charles University Prague JI\u00cd WEIL Lamentation for 77,297 Victims Translated by David Lightfoot \"Smoke from nearby factories shrouds a countryside as flat as a table, a coun- tryside stretching off to innity. Covering it are the ashes of millions of dead. Scattered throughout are ne pieces of bone that ovens were not able to burn. When the wind comes, ashes rise to the heavens, bone fragments remain on the ground. And rain falls on the ashes, and rain turns them to good fertile soil, as bets the ashes of martyrs. And who can nd the ashes of those from my native land, of whom there were 77,297? I gather some ashes with my hand, for only a hand can touch them, and I pour them into a linen sack, just as those who once left for a foreign country would gather their native soil so as never to forget, so as always to return to it.\" So begins Jir\u00ed Weil's unforgettable prose poem, Lamentation for 77,297 Victims , his literary monument to the Czech Jews killed during the Holocaust. A Czech-Jewish writer who worked at Prague's Jewish Museum both during and after the Nazi Occupa-tion\u2014he survived the Holocaust by faking his own death and hiding out until the war had ended\u2014Weil wrote Lamentation while he served as the museum's senior librarian in the 1950s. This remarkable liter-ary experiment presents a number of innovative approaches to writing about a horror many would deem indescribable, combining a narrative account of the Shoah with newspaper-style reportage on a handful of the lives ended by the Holocaust and quotes from the Hebrew Bible to create a specic and powerful portrait of loss and remembrance. Translated by David Lightfoot, Lamentation for 77,297 Victims is a startling and singular introduction to a writer whose works have been acclaimed by Philip Roth, Michiko Kakutani, and Siri Hustvedt.

One of the last students of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, he was a philosophical inspiration to V\u00e1clav Havel and other dissi-dents who confronted the Soviet regimes before 1989, as well as being actively involved in authoring and enacting Charter 77 in Czechoslova-kia. He died in 1977 from medical complications resulting from inter-rogations of the secret police, his political involvement cut short by an untimely death. Confronting Totalitarian Minds examines his legacy along with several contemporary applications of his ideas about dissidence, solidarity, and the human being's existential confrontation with unjust politics. Aspen Brinton puts Pato ka's ideas about political protest, citizen mobiliza- tion, and civic responsibility in conversation with those of notable world historical gures like Mohandas Gandhi, expanding the current possibilities of comparative political theory. In adding a fresh voice to contemporary conversations on transcending injustice, Confronting Totalitarian Minds seeks to educate a wider audience for this philoso-pher's continued relevance to political dissidents across the world.

Applying structuralist methods, Szary-Matywiecka situates Wirtemberska among other literary luminaries of her day, including Rous - seau and Goethe, and explores how the nineteenth-century salon culture formed the concerns and themes of her novel. Malvina 's obsession with language games recalls the vocabulary quizzes and semantic puzzles popular in the European salons frequented by Wirtemberska. Szary-Matywiecka also argues that the novel's motif of twins and twinned characters emerges from both the theatrical preoccupations of salons, as well as how Wirtemberska seemingly splits her voice between tra - ditional narration and a more intru - sive authorial style, helping shape her novel's innovative narrative method. Malvina, or Spoken Word in the Novel is an insightful deconstruction of a female-penned classic of European literature.Malvina, or Spoken Word in the Novel EWA SZARY-MATYWIECKA Translated by Magdalena Ozarska NOVEMBER 230 p. 4 5 3/4 Paper $20.00s LITERARY CRITICISMCZE/SVK Jan Patoka (1907 -77) was the leading Czech philosopher of the twentieth century. He studied phenomenology with Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. His brief teaching career at Charles University in Prague was repeatedly terminated by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Before his death, he became one of the spokesmen of the Charter 77 dissident movement. Eric Manton works at the Jan Patocka Archive at the Center for Theoretical Study in Prague.Spanning his entire career, this selec - tion of texts by influential philosopher Jan Pato ka illustrates his thoughts on the appropriate manner of being and engagement in the world. The writ - ings assembled in Living in Problematic - ity examine the role of the philosopher in the world, how the world constrains us through ideology, and how freedom is possible through the recognition of our human condition in the prob - lems of the world. These views outline Patoka's political philosophy and how his later engagement in the political sphere with the human rights initiative Charter 77 corresponds with the ideas he maintained throughout his life. This short and engaging book\u2014published in conjunction with the prestigious philosophy press OIKOYMENH\u2014is an ideal English-language introduction to the most signicant Czech philosopher in recent history.Living in Problematicity JAN PATO KA Translated by Eric Manton SEPTEMBER 84 p. 5 x 8 ISBN-13: 978-80-246-4510-0 Paper $17.00s / \u00a314.00 PHILOSOPHYCZE/SVK Karolinum Press, Charles University Prague 337 Marie V\u00e1gnerov\u00e1 is a leading Czech psychologist who teaches and publishes in developmen- tal psychology, psychopathology, and school psychology.

M. TURNBULL A History of Modern Singapore, 1819-2005 New Edition First published in 1977, C. M. Turnbull's one-volume history of Singapore has been an essential resource for more than forty years. Turnbull's History provides a solid foundation for understanding of the two-hundred-year trajectory of Singapore from colonial outpost to world city. While many modern studies focus on current affairs or very recent events, emphasizing Singapore's success-ful transition from the developing to the developed world, Turnbull connects this story to Singapore's colonial experience under the East India Company and the British Crown. This new edition, building on two earlier thorough-going revisions, presents the standard history in a new and more affordable format for students, teachers, and anyone fascinated by the many stories of changing Singapore. C. M. Turnbull (1927-2008) rst came to Asia in 1952 as an administrative of- cer in the Malayan Civil Service. In 1955 she accepted a position teaching his-tory at the University of Malaya in Singapore where she remained until 1971, having earned a PhD at the University of London in 1962. She then moved to the University of Hong Kong where she became Professor of History and Head of the Department of History.

Lisabeth Bennink is a historian and Bharatanatyam dancer. Jacob Gotfried Haafner (1754-1809) was one of the most popular European travel writers of the early nineteenth century, writing in the Romantic mode. A Dutch citizen, Haafner spent more than twenty years of his early life living outside of Europe, in India, Ceylon, Mauritius, Java, and South Af - rica. Books like his popular Travels in a Palanquin were translated into the major European languages, and his essays against the work of Christian missionaries in Asia stirred up great controversy. Haafner worked to spread understanding of the cultures he'd come to know in his journeys, pro -moting European understanding of Indian literature, myth, and religion, translating the Ramayana into Dutch. With the help of generous excerpts from Haafner's own writings, includ - ing material newly translated into Eng - lish, Paul van der Velde tells an affect - ing story of a young man who made a world for himself along the Coroman - del Coast, in Ceylon and Calcutta, but who returned to Europe to live the last years of his life in Amsterdam, suffer - ing an acute nostalgia for Asia.

Sixty Malaysian and nine - teen Singaporean religious assemblies identify themselves as Christian Breth -ren, and most trace their roots to inde - pendent local churches formed in Pen - ang and Singapore in the 1860s. After World War II, former Brethren elders founded new independent churches, from charismatic local churches and Pentecostal megachurches to a small network of Exclusive Brethren assem - blies.

He received his medical degree from Dublin and practised medicine in Singapore before migrating to Canada in 1986. If We Dream Too Long was his rst novel, and it won the National Development Council of Singapore Award for Fiction in 1976. Goh's other novels include The Immolation , A Dance of Moths, and Dance with White Clouds .Published in 1972 and widely regarded as the rst Singapore novel, If We Dream Too Long explores the dilemmas and challenges faced by its hero, Kwang Meng, as he navigates the difcult transitional period between youthful aspirations and the external demands of society and family. Shy and sensitive, he feels detached from mainstream life and is unable to identify with the values that animate his friends. Kwang Meng takes refuge in dreams of exotic faraway places, and imagines merging himself with the sea, which he loves. Yet amid this uncertainty, the reader feels that all is not lost, that the young dreamer will eventually nd his way. Kwang Meng's experiences reflect Goh Poh Seng's fascination with the question of self amid the dreariness and aimless - ness of an increasingly urbanized and materialistic Asian society. The book also provides a fascinating portrait of Singapore as it was in the 1960s, a land - scape and society that have since under - gone many changes but remain faintly visible in modern Singapore.

Drawing on original Burmese texts and illustrations, recent scholarship, and mapping, Mandalay and the Art of Building Cities in Burma argues that the founding of Mandalay shifted critically in emphasis and scale during its plan - ning from a protocol that established the royal city as a \"cosmic city\" to one that viewed the royal capital as a sanctu - ary. As part of that shift, Fran\u00e7ois Tain - turier shows, the founding protocol used Buddhist narratives as models for action and drastically altered patterns of spatial order that had been prevalent at former royal capitals. The systematic planning of Mandalay and the con -struction of its potent landscape consti - tuted the expression\u2014formulated not in words but in tangible form\u2014of the throne's claim that Burma was a \"Bud - dhist land,\" at a time when Lower Bur - ma had been annexed by non-Buddhist believers. Tainturier provides further insight into how rulers articulated their lineage, power, and the promotion of Buddhism by creating potent land - scapes. Mandalay and the Art of Building Cities in Burma renews scholarly discus - sion on Southeast Asian urban tradi - tions and offers a critical investigation into the \"cosmic\" dimensions of one of the region's centers of power.

Or so you would think from the tone of media coverage of aging. Getting Wise about Getting Old debunks that myth and many more, in the process painting a far more accurate and nuanced portrait of old age. In this book, experts address persistent stereotypes about aging on a broad array of social issues\u2014from retirement (attacking the myth that seniors are low-performance workers) to housing (clarifying the misconception that most older adults live in long-term care accommodation), and sexuality (showing that senior women remain at risk of sexual assault) to social participa-tion (arguing against beliefs that seniors are conservative and resis-tant to change)\u2014deconstructing and countering them with the latest social science ndings. Built on short, accessible chapters, this vitally important book will contribute to a better understanding of the social challenges, as well as the advantages, of an aging society.

What can they reveal about Canada's nuclear footprint? The Bomb in the Wilderness contends that photography is central to how we have represented, interpreted, and remem - bered nuclear activities since 1945. During World War II, Canada was a member of the Manhattan Project, the consortium that developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Na - gasaki. The impact and global reach of Canada's nuclear programs has been felt ever since. But do photographs alert viewers to nuclear threat, numb them to its dangers, or by some strange calculus accomplish both? John O'Brian's wide-ranging and personal account of the nuclear era reproduces and discusses a hundred photographs, ranging from military images to the atomic ephem - era of consumer culture.

A 31-year-old mother of six in Melbourne, Australia in 1865, she was newly widowed, and her husband's will, written on his deathbed, offered a reasonable annuity to support her and the children. But it came with a catch: To get that money, she had to move to Ireland with her children and live in a house of her brothers-in-law's choosing. English-born, Caroline had migrated to Australia with her family when she was only seventeen. She had never even been to Ireland. Her husband and his family, unlike her, were Catholic. What life would await her there? Bettina Bradbury tells this extraor -dinary story through compelling his - torical detective work. Piecing together evidence from archives, newspapers, genealogical sites, legal records, and old-fashioned legwork, she brings a nineteenth-century woman to life\u2014and in the process sheds new light on the workings of gender relationships and family lives that spanned the globe in the nineteenth century. Offering new insight into nineteenth-century women's property rights, migration, settler colonialism, the Irish diaspora, and sectarian conflict, Caroline's Dilem - ma shows how one middle-class woman and her family fought to shape their own lives within the British Empire.

In Ours by Every Law of Right and Justice , Sarah Carter challenges the surprisingly re - silient myth that grateful male legisla - tors simply handed western women the vote in recognition that they were equal partners in the pioneering process. Rather, she shows, suffragists worked long and hard to overcome obstacles, persuade doubters, and build allies. Yet their work also had a dark side. Even as settler suffragists pressured legislatures to grant their sisters the vote, they of - ten approved of that same right being denied to \"foreigners\" and Indigenous men and women. By situating the suf - fragists' struggle in the colonial history of Prairie Canada, this powerful and passionate book shows that the right to vote meant different things to different people\u2014political rights and emancipa - tion for some, domination and democ - racy denied for others.Ours by Every Law of Right and Justice Women and the Vote in the Prairie Provinces SARAH CARTER Women's Suffrage and the Struggle for Democracy November 272 p. 25 halftones 5 1/4 x 8 1/4ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6187-8 Cloth $30.95s :20(1\u00b76 678',(6 +,6725<USA Penny Gurstein is professor and former director of the School of Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia and is coeditor of Learning Civil Societ- ies: Shifting Contexts for Democratic Planning and Governance .

While recognizing the many successes of the \"Vancouverism\" model, the contributors acknowledge that the forces of globalization and speculative property development have increased social inequality and housing insecurity since the 1980s in the city and the region. To determine the city's prospects for overcoming these prob -lems, they look at city planning from all angles, including planning for the Indigenous population, environmental and disaster planning, housing and mi - gration, and transportation and water management. By looking at policies at the local, provincial, and federal levels and taking reconciliation with Indige - nous peoples into account, Planning on the Edge highlights the kinds of policies and practices needed to reorient Van - couver's development trajectory along a more environmentally sound and equi - table path.Planning on the Edge Vancouver and the Challenges of Reconciliation, Social Justice, and Sustainable Development Edited by PENNY GURSTEIN and TOM HUTTON SEPTEMBER 352 p. 32 halftones 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6166-3 Cloth $99.00x ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6167-0 $37.95s URBAN STUDIESUSA University of British Columbia Press 349Jeremy Patrick is a lecturer in the School of Law and Justice at the University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia, where he also convenes the law, religion, and heritage research program team.The growing presence in Western so - ciety of non-mainstream faiths and spiritual practices poses a dilemma for the law. For example, if a fortune teller promises to tell the future in exchange for cash, and both parties believe in the process, has a fraud been committed? Using that example as a case study, and building on a thorough history of the legal regulation of fortune-telling laws in four countries, Faith or Fraud exam - ines the impact of people who identify as \"spiritual but not religious\" on the future legal understanding of religious freedom. Traditional legal notions of religious freedom, Jeremy Patrick ex - plains, were conceived in the context of organized religion; now the law needs to adapt to a contemporary spirituality, in which individuals can select concepts drawn from multiple religions, philoso - phies, and folklore to develop their own idiosyncratic belief systems. Faith or Fraud exposes the law's failure to rec - ognize individual spirituality as part of modern religious practice, concluding that legal understanding of freedom of religion has not evolved along with reli - gion itself.Faith or Fraud Fortune-Telling, Spirituality, and the Law JEREMY PATRICK Law and Society SEPTEMBER 280 p. 4 halftones 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6332-2 Cloth $89.95x ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6333-9 Paper $35.95s of British Columbia Press Obiora Chinedu Okafor is the York Research Chair in International and Transnational Legal Studies and professor of law at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University.

But did they? If so, how do the responses of the two countries compare in terms of their negative impacts on refugee rights? Refugee Law after 9/11 undertakes a systematic examination of available legal, policy, and empirical evidence to reveal a great irony: refugee rights were already so whittled down in both countries before 9/11 that there was relatively little room for negative change after the attacks. Obiora Chin - edu Okafor also shows that the US and Canadian governments reacted to 9/11 through changes to their laws concern - ing refugees in much the same way\u2014and argues that these similar reactions raise signicant questions about securi - ty relativism and the cogency of US and Canadian national self-images.Refugee Law after 9/11 Sanctuary and Security in Canada and the United States OBIORA CHINEDU OKAFOR SEPTEMBER 362 p. 6 ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-6147-2 Paper $37.95s LAWUSA is associate professor of history at Saint Mary's University and the editor of Resil - ient Japan: Papers Presented at the 24th Annual Conference of the Japan Studies Association of Canada and Seven Crucial Centuries: Changes in Premodern Chinese Society and Economy, 499 BCE-1800 CE .Civilians play crucial roles in building empires.

As Bill Sewell shows, Japanese imperialism in Manchuria before 1932 developed in a manner similar to that of other imperialists elsewhere in Chi - na\u2014but thereafter the Japanese sought to surpass their rivals by transforming the city of Changchun into a grand cap - ital for the puppet state of Manchukuo, putting it on the cutting edge of Japa - nese propaganda.

Saving the Nation through Culture opens a new chapter in the history of the international Folklore Movement by exploring the evolution of the disci - pline's Chinese branch. Jie Gao shows how intellectuals in the New Culture Movement influenced the founding folklorists with their aim to repudiate Confucianism following the Chinese Republic's failure to modernize the na - tion. The folklorists, however, faced a unique challenge: advocating for mod - ern academic methods while uphold - ing folklore as the key to the nation's salvation. Largely unknown in the West and underappreciated in China, the Modern Folklore Movement failed to achieve its goal of reinvigorating the Chinese nation. But it helped establish a modern discipline, promoting a spirit of academic independence that still in - fluences Chinese intellectuals today.Saving the Nation through Culture The Folklore Movement in Republican China JIE GAO Contemporary Chinese Studies OCTOBER 364 p. 20 halftones 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-0-7748-3839-9 of British Columbia Press 351Sarah Biddulph is a professor in the Melbourne Law School and director of its Asian Law Centre, and Assistant Deputy Vice Chancellor\u2014International (China) at the University of Melbourne.

At this time, Warburg lived and researched in Florence, and the lecture series was designed to raise his prole as a private scholar back home, but also, as Warburg's brother Max put it, to give something back to the community. The Leonardo lec - tures, as they came to be known, are unique in the oeuvre of this scholar who tended to engage with very specic research problems. With an average attendance of more than 400, Warburg's lectures were a great success, and a fourth meeting, accompanied by original Leonardo drawings and photographic prints in the Hamburg Kunsthalle, had to be re - peated. Marking the fth centenary of Leonardo's death and the 120th anni - versary of Warburg's rst public lecture series, this volume contains the full translated text of Warburg's previously unpublished lectures. This translation, which is based on the texts as they sur - vive in Warburg's three manuscripts lo - cated in the Warburg Institute Archive, will bring these groundbreaking lec - tures to a new audience.Three Lectures on Leonardo ABY WARBURG Edited by Eckart Marchand, Joseph Spooner, and Bill Sherman JANUARY 60 p. 8 3/4 x 11 ISBN-13: 978-1-908590-93-0 Paper $15.00s CULTURAL STUDIES LITERATURECUSD University of London Press 357Guillermo Mira is professor of American history at the University of Salamanca.

As vice president of the International Studies Association (ISA) he founded the human rights section of ISA.Since the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, geno - cide, crimes against humanity, and oth - er mass atrocities have been explicitly illegal. When such crimes are commit - ted, the international community has an obligation to respond, which has come to be known as \"the responsibility to protect.\" Parallel to this responsibility, two related responsibilities have developed: to prosecute those responsible for the crimes, and to provide humanitarian relief to the victims\u2014what Kurt Mills in this book calls the \"responsibility to palliate.\" While this rhetoric of protec - tion is well used by the international community, its application in practice has been erratic at best. In International Responses to Mass Atrocities in Africa , Mills develops a typology of responses to mass atrocities, considering four cases in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Darfur. Put - ting the cases into historical context and analyzing them according to this typology, Mills investigates the limita - tions of these responses and calls for such responses to be implemented in a more timely and thoughtful manner.

Mapping Crisis questions whether it is the map itself that is in crisis. This book brings together critical perspec - tives on the role that mapping people, knowledges, and data now plays in hu - manitarian work, both in cartographic terms and through data visualizations. Since the rise of Google Earth in 2005, there has been an explosion in the use of mapping tools to quantify and as -sess the needs of the poor, including those affected by climate change and the wider neo-liberal agenda. Yet, while there has been a huge upsurge in the data produced around these issues, the representation of people remains ques - tionable. Some have argued that repre - sentation has diminished as people are increasingly reduced to data points. In turn, this data has become ever more difcult to analyze without vast com - puting power, leading to a dependency on the old colonial powers to rene the data of the poor, before selling it back to them.Mapping Crisis Participation, Datacation and Humanitarianism in the Age of Digital Mapping Edited by DOUG SPECHT HRC series DECEMBER 230 p. 6 x 9 ISBN-13: 978-1-912250-33-2 Paper $40.00s CARTOGRAPHY CURRENT EVENTSCUSD Anne Thurston has pioneered international solutions for managing public sector records.

Fisher is a research historian. She coordinates the Leicestershire Victoria County History for the University of Leicestershire.Ibstock is a large village 15 miles north- west of Leicester, on the eastern edge of the Leicestershire coaleld. Ibstock's character changed dramatically in the later 19th century, when the coal de - posits beneath Ibstock began to be ex - ploited. Two collieries were sunk within the parish, in 1825 and 1873, ushering in a period of rapid population growth. This was accompanied by the growth of nonconformity, including the estab - lishment of Anglican, Baptist, Primitive Methodist, Wesleyan Methodist, and Wesleyan Reform churches. In turn, this led to the establishment of numer - ous sports teams, clubs, and other so - cieties, some encouraged by Ibstock's various ministers. The former colliery brickworks continued, and Ibstock Brick, based in the parish, became one of Britain's largest brickmakers in the early twenty-rst century. The mines have since closed, and much of the un - dermined farmland has been planted with young trees from the 1990s, to be - come part of the National Forest. This volume about Ibstock marks the third book in the Victoria County History of Leicestershire, presented as part of the VCH Shorts series. This series aims to offer high-quality local histories of English towns, villages, and parishes.

His work on radical politics and anticlericalism in 1930s Spain has appeared in the English Historical Review , Cultural & Social History , and European History Quarterly .In October 1934, the northern Span - ish region of Asturias was the scene of one of the most important outbursts of revolution in Europe. Thousands of left-wing militants took up arms and fought the Spanish army in the streets of Oviedo, while in the rear-guard committees proclaimed a revolution - ary dawn. After two weeks, however, the insurrection was crushed, and the ensuing widespread repression was central to the polarization and frag - mentation of Spanish politics prior to the Civil War (1936-39). Weaving to - gether a range of everyday disputes and arenas of conflict, from tenant activism to strikes, boycotts to political violence, Unite, Proletarian Brothers! reveals how local cleavages and conflicts operating within the context of the Spanish Sec - ond Republic (1931-36) and interwar Europe explain the origins, develop - ment and consequences of the Asturian October. The book sheds new light on the long-debated process of \"radicaliza - tion\" during the Second Republic, as well as the wider questions of protest, revolutionary politics, and social and political conflict in inter-war Europe.

That determination led him to his most experimental and incendiary project, To Have Done with the Judgement of God, 1947-48 , in which he attempted to create a new language of texts, screams, and cacophonies: a language designed to be heard by millions, aimed, as Artaud said, for \"road-menders.\" In the broadcast, he interrogated corporeality and introduced the idea of the \"body without organs,\" crucial to the later work of Deleuze and Guattari. The broadcast, commissioned by the French national radio station, was banned shortly before its planned transmission, much to Artaud's fury. This volume collects all of the texts for To Have Done with the Judgement of God , together with several of the letters Artaud wrote to friends and enemies in the short period between his work's censorship and his death. Also included is the text of an earlier broadcast from 1946, Madness and Black Magic , written as a manifesto preguring his subse- quent broadcast. Clayton Eshleman's extraordinary translations of the broadcasts activate these works in their extreme provocation. Antonin Artaud (1895-1948) was a French dramatist, poet, essayist, actor, and theater director, widely recognized as one of the major gures of twentieth-century theater and the European avant-garde.

That auditorium was both a catastrophe and a vital precursor for the following cen - tury's manias for projection. Based on new research into his travels, audiences, auditoria, and projectors, The Projection - ists explores Muybridge's initiating role in moving-image projection and also maps his driving inspiration for subse - quent lmmakers preoccupied with the volatile entity of projection, from 1890s Berlin to contemporary Japan, via fur - ther World's Exposition events and cin - emas' overheated projection-boxes.The Projectionists Eadweard Muybridge and the Future Projections of the Moving Image STEPHEN BARBER JULY 208 p. 6 color plates, 20 halftones 5 1/4 x 8 3/4ISBN-13: 978-3-0358-0289-4 Paper PHOTOGRAPHY BE/FR/LU Claire Brizon is a PhD candidate in history of art at the University of Bern, Switzerland.

Scholars have emphasized this era's emerging taste for the exotic in order to explain the unprecedented craze for lacquer, porcelain, and textiles that imitated non-Western techniques and iconog - raphy. Yet what constituted the exotic during the Age of Enlightenment? How was the place of foreign material cul - ture negotiated? And how did it impact European identities? Exotic Switzerland?moves from questions about the nature of exoticism to explore exoticism in practice.

On the one hand, law is praised for being a cultural achieve - ment, on the other, it is criticized for being an instrument of state oppres - sion. Legal criticism's strategies to deal with this ambivalence differ greatly. While some seek to transcend the in - stitution of law altogether, others advo -cate a transformation of the form of law or try to employ strategies to change the content of law, deconstruct its basis, or invent rights. By presenting a variety of approaches to legal criticism, What's Legit? highlights transitions and exhib - its irreconcilable differences of these approaches. Ultimately, What's Legit? broadens debates that are all too often conducted only within the boundaries of separate theoretical currents.What's Legit?

Since the end of the eighteenth century, there has been a dynamization and fluidization of the understanding of form, as concepts such as the break, marginalization, tearing, and opening indicate. As a philosophical problem, the question of form arises in critical theory from Marx to Adorno. Since the 1960s, literary practices have prolifer - ated that generate critical statements less through traditional argument and more through the programmatic use of formal means. At the same time, the writing self, along with its attitudes, reflections, affects, and instruments, visibly enters the critical scene. This volume examines how the interdepen - dence of critique, object, and form trans - lates into critical stances, understood as learnable, reproducible gestures that bear witness to changing conditions and media of critical practice.Critique The Stakes of Form Edited by SAMI KHATIB, HOLGER KUHN, OONA LOCHNER, ISABEL MEHL, and BEATE S\u00d6NTGEN Critical Stances AUGUST 372 p. 25 halftones 4 3/4 x 7 3/4ISBN-13: 978-3-0358-0240-5 the DFG research training group \"minor cosmopolitanisms\" at Potsdam University, Germany.In the wake of rapid globalization, many enthusiastically declared cosmo - politanism to be no longer just a philo - sophical ideal, but a real, existing fact. Across the world, they argued, people were increasingly considering them - selves global citizens. Meanwhile, the global ecological crisis worsened, fas - cism returned, repression of disenfran - chised groups on a global scale persist - ed, and the \"refugee crisis\" inundated the mediascape. What happened to the cosmopolitan promise, and who be - trayed it? Minor cosmopolitan challenges the underlying premises of major cos - mopolitanism without letting go of the unfullled emancipatory potential of the concept at large. It rethinks cosmo - politanisms in the plural, and it traces multiple origins and trajectories of cos - mopolitan thought across the globe. Assembling theoretical, artistic, and essayistic contributions in textual or visual formats, minor cosmopolitan seeks to discuss how to live at once with our difference and shared struggle and asks who sustains the world's flourishing.minor cosmopolitan thinking art, politics, and the universe together otherwise Edited by ZAIRONG XIANG AUGUST 256 p. 25 halftones 6 1/4 x 1/4ISBN-13: 978-3-0358-0304-4 (1941-93) was a German philosopher, professor, and director of the Department of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City.

Extending his highly original engagement with the history of philosophy, Sch\u00fcrmann draws out this axis, which determines and localizes his theories of history, so - cial relations, and economy. Whereas Marxist readings of Marx conceive his - tory, classes, and social relations as pri - mary realities, Sch\u00fcrmann brings out a radically immanent understanding of praxis that introduces multiplicity. This edition is complemented by a reprint - ing of Sch\u00fcrmann's anti-humanism es - say, in which he reads Marx alongside Nietzsche and Heidegger as spelling out the dissociation of being and action. Reading Marx showcases underappreci - ated facets of Sch\u00fcrmann's work and offers an interpretation of Marx that resonates with the readings of Jacques Derrida, Michel Henry, Antonio Negri, and Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle.Reading Marx Materialism REINER Fabian Rauch and Nicolas Schneider Reiner Sch\u00fcrmann Selected Writings and Lecture Notes OCTOBER 176 p. 5 1/4 x 8 1/4 ISBN-13: 978-3-0358-0201-6 Paper was a German philosopher, professor, and director of the Department of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City.

Mod - ern Philosophies of the Will explores a vari - ety of topics including: the ontological turn in philosophy of the will; the will's playful character and the problem of te - leology; the will as principle of morality as discussed by Kant, of life forms as dis - cussed by Nietzsche, and of technology as discussed by Heidegger; the formal identity of legislation; and transgression of the law.

Illustrated by Junko Shibuya Why is a horse called a horse and not a giraffe or a flapdoo- dle? Why did Plato go from being called Aristocles, after his grandfather, to being called Plato, which means mus- cleman? Where do any names come from? In this delightful pop-up book, readers young and old will explore with Plato and ponder why anything or anyone has a name at all. Do readers know where their own name comes from? At its most basic, philosophy is about learning how to think about the world around us. It should come as no surprise, then, that children make excellent philosophers! Naturally inquisitive, pint-size schol-ars need little prompting before being willing to consider life's \"big questions,\" however strange or impractical. Plato & Co. introduces children\u2014and curious grown-ups\u2014to the lives and work of famous philosophers, from Descartes to Socrates, Einstein, Marx, and Wittgen - stein. Each book in the series features an engaging\u2014and often funny\u2014 story that presents basic tenets of philosophical thought alongside vibrant color illustrations.

This short-lived group\u2014with participants including G\u00fcnter Brus, Otto M\u00fchl, Hermann Nitsch, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler\u2014 stirred shock and moral outrage as it produced a series of performance-based works that transformed the human body through violent and transgressive actions, often involving blood, semen, meat, and excreta. Defying the powers of the state and rejecting traditional commodiable art practices, they enact-ed their art on the body, creating performances that live on in works of residue, photography, and lm. The lms of the Vienna Action Group\u2014made both by members of the group and by collaborators such as Kurt Kren\u2014form the essential records of their performances. The medium of lm is intimately tied to their experiments in performance and material, and this book provides an essential focus on those lms that reveal the obsessions, ambitions, and outrages of the Action Group. Their work constitutes a signicant moment in twentieth-century art and continues to influence contemporary art today, and The Art of Destruction offers a compre-hensive introduction to their radical works in lm and performance. This new edition includes new photographs throughout along with updates on the lives and recent events of the Vienna Action Group. With copious illustrations, annotations, and an extensive lmography, this book will be a resource for students and scholars of lm, art, and performance, and for those invested in questioning social and corpo-rate cultures.

SMITHIES Introducing the Medieval Ass Introducing the Medieval Ass presents a lucid, accessible, and com- prehensive picture of the enormous socioeconomic and cultural signicance of the ass, or donkey, in the Middle Ages and beyond. In medieval times, the ass was a vital, utilitarian beast of burden, rath-er like ubiquitous white delivery vans today. At the same time, however, the ass had a rich, paradoxical reputation. Its hard work was praised but its obstinacy condemned. It exemplied the good Christian, hum-bly bearing Christ to Jerusalem, but also represented sloth, a mortal sin. It had a potent sexual reputation\u2014in one literary work, an ass had sex with a woman\u2014even as it was simultaneously linked to steril-ity. Over time, the ass also became synonymous with human idiocy, a comic gure representing foolish peasants, students too dull to learn, and their asinine teachers. This trope of foolishness was so prevalent that by the eighteenth century the word \"ass\" began to be replaced by \"donkey.\" Introducing the Medieval Ass offers a wide-ranging account of the importance, and often surprising cultural prevalence, of this com-mon domesticated animal.

In the early twentieth century, he played a prominent part in the revo-lution in physics with the emergence of quantum physics, and he was an able experimentalist and brilliant theoreti -cian who made notable contributions to atomic physics and the discovery of a new elementary particle.

One of its outcomes was the unprecedented growth of Nonconfor - mity by the nineteenth century, which established a very clear difference be - tween Wales and England in religious terms. Since the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist movement did not split from the Church to form a separate denom - ination until 1811, it existed in its ear - ly years solely as a collection of local society meetings. Focusing on those early societies in southwest Wales, this study examines the grass roots of the Methodist movement, identifying the features that led to its subsequent re - markable success. At the heart of the book lie the experiences of the men and women who were members of the societies, along with explorations of their social and economic background and the factors that attracted them to the Methodist cause.

This book considers its rise as a seaside resort and reveals a history that is much more complex, lengthy, and important than has previously been recognized. As conventionally told, the story of the island as tourist resort begins in the 1890s, when the railway arrived in Barry. Yet Barry had been functioning as a watering hole since the 1790s\u2014 although decades of tourism produced no sweeping changes. Barry remained a district of \"bathing villages\" and ham - lets, rather than developing into an ur - ban resort, as might have been expect-ed. As such, the history of Barry Island challenges us to rethink the category of \"seaside resort\" and forces us reeval - uate Wales's contribution to British coastal tourism in the long nineteenth century. It also underlines the impor - tance of the agency of those who visited the island. Powerful landowners shaped much of the island's development, but ultimately it was the working-class vis - itors who turned it into south Wales's most beloved tripper resort.Barry Island The Making of a Seaside Playground, c. 1790-c. 1965 ANDY CROLL SEPTEMBER 288 p. 8 color plates, 17 halftones 5 1/4 x 8 in modern history at Swansea University.Founded in 1920, Swansea University is now the third-largest university in Wales, serving nearly twenty thousand students This volume celebrates the centennial of the university, offering a portrait of postwar academic and social change in Britain and its universities, as well as an exploration of shifts in youth culture and the ways higher education institutions have interacted with their areas and communities.

While cooking shows are far from new, they have exploded in popularity in recent years and have changed consumption patterns at a time when what we eat is of enormous consequence for climate change. What was once merely a genre is now a full-blown phenomenon: never before has food been so photographed, fawned over, fetishized, and celebrated as a way to save the planet. Celebrity chefs and so-called \"foodies\" have risen to new levels of fame, and the cultural capital of cooking has never been so valuable.

The ideas of the all-male organization were so incendiary for their time that, in 1881, its leaders created the Ladies Land League so \"that the women might carry on the work after the men were imprisoned\" and appointed Anna Par - nell\u2014sister of Land League president Charles Stewart Parnell\u2014as its head. Tale of a Great Sham is Anna Parnell's account of the work of the La - dies Land League, as well as a detailed analysis of what she saw as the short - comings of the National Land League's executive members. Anna was a com - mitted radical and remained one even after her brother Charles had dropped his most progressive views in favor of what she saw as a watered-down com - promise\u2014the so-called \"great sham\" of the Kilmainham Treaty, which did little to alleviate the injustices suf - fered by tenant farmers. Featuring an introduction from the renowned fem - inist historian Margaret Ward, Tale of a Great Sham is a comprehensive study of an important group overlooked for too long in the chronicles of Ireland's radical past.Tale of a Great Sham Edited by DANA HEARNE With an Introduction by Margaret Ward NOVEMBER 120 p. 8 1/4 x 5 1/4 ISBN-13: 978-1-910820-59-9 Paper $25.00s HISTORYNAM University College Dublin Press 379 5th PROOF MARY JULIE Irish Rivers Edited by MARY KELLY-QUINN and JULIAN D.

Joni Kitmiiq Spiess is an I\u00f1upiaq woman born in Nome, Alaska, who has been a traditional games competitor, coach, and encourager to many. Roy Corral is a veteran photographer whose work has appeared in books, magazines, and websites nationally, among them Alaska magazine, National Geographic , and Forbes . The athletes of the Alaska Native games aren't just returning to their roots. They've never left them. In this beauti - fully illustrated book, readers learn the history of twenty-ve Native games that have been handed down through gen - erations, how each one relates to the subsistence lifestyle, and how you can try them yourself, regardless of where you live. As Tricia Nuyaqik Brown shows, even though today's competitions are a big media event in Alaska, the games themselves are really no different from those of long ago. Ancestral communi - ties once pitted their strongest, their most agile, their fastest men and wom - en against those from neighboring villages or tribal groups. Those games never died, but rather than gathering in a sod meeting place, competitions are now held in gyms and arenas. Each game today can be linked to some aspect of surviving in a harsh en - vironment, of drawing sustenance from the land and sea. From the Seal Hop to the Bench Reach to the Four-Man Carry, these ancient games still require athletes to be in top physical condition and possess sharp mental focus. They hold dear the traditional Native values of honoring the elders, responsibility to tribe, sportsmanship, humor, patience, and hunter success. This book offers an engaging introduction to these games and their history, inviting people to jump in and try them for themselves!

Over the next decade, growing up and growing into her home, she found herself thinking through her ever-changing ideas about aging and place, a lot of which were wrapped up closely in her experience of living in the house itself. Cabin 135 provided shelter and security, and it also offered lessons on economic disruptions and how ideas of normalcy change.

About heeding that call? And might wandering serve not only to map new places but also to map the most familiar ones, like home? Depar - tures and returns in these essays derive in large part from the narrator's per - sonal experiences of cross-continental travel by pickup truck and by airplane, human-powered expedition-style travel by kayak, regional travel by ferry, and her daily or local travel on foot.

Focusing speci - cally on North America's Pacic coast, Hayes and Michel explain how the San Andreas Fault system created a new and complex shoreline that has enthralled visitors from around the world, and he shows how the coastline has changed through erosion driven by El Ni\u00f1os, the effects of tsunamis, the formation of spectacular raised marine terrac - es created as a result of the changing sea level during the ice ages, and the continuing rise of the Coast Ranges. Richly illustrated with original dia - grams, photographs, and satellite im - agery, the book paints a truly complete picture of a complicated topic smoothly distilled from the scientic literature and personal observations along the coast.A Coast to Explore Coastal Geology and Ecology of Central California MILES O.

Droby is a licensed psychologist who has been in the eld of mental health for nearly thirty years.In With the Wind and the Waves , psychol - ogist Ray M. Droby tells a story of treat - ment and learning, drawing on experi - ences ranging from an ocean journey he took on the Bering Sea while serv - ing in a Alaska native community to his clinical work as a psychologist in rural Alaska. Like negotiating an ocean, Droby moves \"with the wind and the waves\" while working with substance abuse disorders and mental health issues superimposed on intergenerational trauma and internalized oppression. He captures positive momentum in work aimed at facilitating self-deter - mination with Alaska natives and their communities while discouraging his - torical dependency and colonizing pat - terns of thinking and doing for mental health workers. Sensitive to the history of non-native outsiders imposing their own culture on native land, Droby pres - ents here principles, combined with cultural and therapy considerations, that are designed to help people avoid replicating this history of harm.

Once again, we are witness to a surge in right wing au - thoritarianism, ethnonationalism, and white supremacism, and the racist, xe - nophobic, and misogynist violence they spread. Like historic newsreels brought back to life, renewed waves of refugees are turned away at borders, placed in cages, or washed up lifeless on the shore. Such striking similarities be - tween present and past suggest that we are not done with the issues raised by the historical Jewish Question: that is, what is the place of \"the Jew\"\u2014the mi - nority, the relic, the rootless stranger, the racialized other, the exiled, the dis - placed, the immigrant, the diasporic? In The Jewish Question Again , leading scholars grapple with our inability to keep these struggles in the past and why we continue to repeat these atrocities.

Jon Stewart is a research fellow at the Institute of Philosophy at the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Bratislava. He is chief editor of the Danish Golden Age Studies and Texts from Golden Age Denmark series published by Museum Tusculanum Press.The Danish Golden Age was marked by several key events: the Napoleonic Wars, the bombardment of Copenha - gen, the state bankruptcy in 1814 and the ensuing nancial crisis, the revolu - tion of 1848, and the establishment of a parliamentary democracy in 1849. At the same time, there were peasant re - forms, religious upheavals, and signi - cant changes in class and social struc - tures. The contributors to this volume argue that these different crises did not just serve as a backdrop for or as obsta - cles to the flowering of culture in the Golden Age, but were instead the cata - lysts for it. Despite their many debates and polemics among themselves, the leading gures of Golden Age Denmark were generally in agreement about the fact that their age was in a state of crisis. The dramatic events spilled over into the various cultural spheres and shaped them in different ways. The essays in this volume trace the different crises as they appear in literature, criticism, religion, philosophy, politics, and the social sciences. Drawing compelling parallels between the perceived crisis of the Golden Age and the acute issues of our own day, this book strongly makes the case for the continuing relevance of the Golden Age for readers today.

Teaching and learning about the Holocaust is central to school curricu - lums across the globe. But the history of the Holocaust remains controversial and can render teaching it daunting, even to the most experienced instruc - tors. Drawing on landmark research into teaching practices and students' knowledge, Holocaust Education pro -vides unique insights about classroom learning. It sheds light on key chal - lenges in Holocaust education, includ - ing the impact of misconceptions and misinformation, the dilemma posed by images of atrocity, and how to approach teaching in ethnically diverse environ - ments. Overviews of the most signi - cant debates in Holocaust education provide wider context for the classroom evidence.

Novels have the pow - er to paint the problems presented with accessibility and spark change. Analyz - ing ve iconic literary texts, including Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left of Darkness , Verena Stefan's H\u00e4utungen , Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time , and June Arnold's The Cook and the Carpenter, Luck dives into the possi - bilities and challenges of linguistic neu - trality.

The book provides a detailed study of three doctrinal paradigms where proprietary relations have been erased, denied, or misappropriated by the In - dian state. It examines three instan - tiations of negation, where the Indian state de facto adopted the doctrines of terra nullius (in the erasure of indigenous title), res nullius (in acquiring museum objects), and, controversially, corpus nulli - us (in denying ownership of one's person - hood in citizens' data collected through biometric identication). Nullius contends that even though property rights and ownership are a cor - nerstone of modern law, they are a spec - tral presence in the Indian case. This book will be of interest to scholars and students of the anthropology of the state, law, data, museums, legal history, intellec - tual property, cultural property, heritage, historical anthropology, and South Asia.

Mitchell undertook eldwork on suffering and healing among the Lujere of Papua New Guinea's Upper Sepik River Basin. At a time when it was not yet common to make colonial agencies a subject of an - thropological study, Mitchell carefully located his research on Lujere practices in the framework of a history of coloni - zation that surrounded the Lujere with a shifting array of Western institutions, dramatically changing their society for - ever. This work has been well known among anthropologists of Oceania ever since, but the bulk of it has remained un -published until now. In this major new work, Mitch - ell revisits his earlier research with a three-part study on: the history of colonial rule in the region; the social organization of Lujere life at the time; and the particular forms of affliction, witchcraft, and curing that preoccu - pied some of the people among whom he lived. This is a magisterial contribu - tion to the ethnography of Papua New Guinea and it is sure to be an invaluable source for scholars of Oceania, of medi - cal anthropology, and of the anthropol - ogy of kinship, myth, and ritual.A Witch's Hand Curing, Killing, Kinship, and Colonialism among the Lujere of New Guinea's River Basin WILLIAM E.

He conducts research on kinship, gender, residence, and intimacy among the indigenous Guna of Panama.Through a rich narrative ethnography of domestic life, this book explores the philosophy of social relations among the Guna (Cuna), an Amerindian people of Panama. This intimate study brings us into the heart of the family economy, describing its nuanced inter - actions among coresidents through two dimensions: an aesthetic of production resting on the gendered division of la - bor and an ethic of affects informing the language and enactment of kin - ship. By exploring local techniques of nurture\u2014child-rearing, singing, feeding, and care practices\u2014the book shows how the Guna create kinship and inhabit gender. The acceptance the Guna show for same-sex relationships and cross-gender roles\u2014which they accorded to the author himself\u2014al - lows kinship to be both subverted and afrmed at the same time. Subvert - ing kinship does not undermine the structure or dynamics of residential interrelations; on the contrary, it dra - matically foregrounds kinship as a lived experience of reciprocal nurture, thus enabling gender to be modulated, and inhabited in multiple ways.

Whether faced with trag-edy, approaching disaster, or an all-too-familiar uncertainty, Stansel's protagonists\u2014siblings, lovers, executives, drifters\u2014reveal complex and often startling turns of mind, surprising themselves as well as the reader. In Boulder, a man calls into a radio program with an altered tale of his brother's murder\u2014and faces the consequences when the story goes viral. In Tampa, a woman attends a convention of people believ-ing themselves to be targets of clandestine government agencies. In Houston, a family with many secrets attempts to escape an oncoming tropical storm. In an East Coast college town, a professor has a charged run-in with a young woman from the radical right. And in Iowa, a cult suicide spurs the lone survivor to create a \"glossary\" in an effort to come to terms with his experience. Simultaneously gritty and lyrical, grounded and visionary, Glossary for the End of Days gives us characters grappling with how to push on through dark days and dark times. This arresting, relevant collection tunes into and seeks to illuminate shared anxieties about the present\u2014and future\u2014of our world. Ian Stansel is the author of the novel The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo and the short story collection Everybody's Irish , a nalist for the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize for Debut Fiction.

In this poetry collection, the goddess of spring now comes and goes erratically, drinks too much, and takes a human lover in our warming, unraveling world. Meanwhile, Persephone's mother searches for her troubled daughter, and human-ity is rst seduced by the unseasonable abundance, then devastated by the fallout, and nally roused to act. This ecopoetic collection interweaves the voices of Persephone, Demeter, and a human chorus with a range of texts, including specu-lative cryptostudies that shed light on the culture of the \"Late Anthro-pocene.\" These voices speak of decadence and blame, green crabs and neonicotinoids, mysteries and efgies. They reckon with extreme weather, industrialized plenty, and their own roles in ecological collapse. Tonally, the poems of this book range between the sublime and the profane; formally, from lyric verse and modern magical-realist prose poems to New Farmer's Almanac riddles and pop-anthropology texts. At the heart of this varied and inventive collection is story itself, as Demeter deconstructs \"whodunits,\" as the chorus grasps that myth-making is an act of \"throwing their voices,\" and as their very language mirrors the downward spiral of destruction. Together, the collected pieces of Persephone in the Late Anthropocene form a narrative prism, ex-ploring both environmental crisis and the question of how we tell it.

(\"Very: is there a weaker, sadder, more futile word in the English language?\") Clarke supports his case with passages by and about writers who have both infl uenced and irritated him. Pieces such as \"What the Cold Can Teach Us,\" \"The Case for Meanness,\" \"Why Good Literature Makes Us Bad People,\" and \"The Novel is Dead; Long Live the Novel\" celebrate the achievements of master practitioners such as Muriel Spark, Joy Williams, Donald Barthelme, Flannery O'Connor, Paul Beatty, George Saunders, John Cheever, and Colson Whitehead. Of particular interest to Clarke is the contentious divide between ction and memoir, which he investigates using recent and relevant critical arguments, also tackling ancillary forms such as \" ctional memoir\" and the autobiographical novel. Anecdotal and unabashed, perceptive\u2014 not to mention fl at-out funny\u2014 I, Grape ; or The Case for Fiction is a love letter to and a passionate defense of the discipline to which its author has devoted his life and mind. It is also an attempt to eff the ineffable: \"That is one of the basic tenets of this book: when we write ction, sur-prising things sometimes happen, especially when ction writers take advantage of their chosen form's contrarian ability to surprise.\" Brock Clarke is an award-winning author of eight works of ction, including the bestselling An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England . He lives in Maine and teaches at Bowdoin College.

Chris Hanlin is an architect, amateur historian, photographer, and longtime cyclist. Bicycling Through Paradise is a collection of twenty historically themed cycling tours in and around Cincinnati, Ohio\u2014each ten to eighty miles in length and divided into 10-mile segments. Written by two longtime cyclists\u2014one a profes-sor of history and one an architect\u2014the book is an affectionate, intimate, and provocative tour of the local landscape and history. Navigated and narrated by these Cincinnati locals, Kathleen Smythe and Chris Hanlin wind their way through tours lled with trails and tales of Native Americans, early settlers, and recent change-makers. With exten-sive details on routes and sites along the way, and photos, the tours are de-signed for all levels of cyclists, and can be equally enjoyed by the armchair ex-plorer. Riders and readers will visit towns called Edenton, Loveland, Felicity, and Utopia. They'll encounter an aban-doned Shaker village near the Whitewa-ter Forest and a tiny dairy house called \"Harmony Hill,\" the oldest standing structure in Clermont County, Ohio; and they'll take in the view from the top of a 2,000-year-old, 75-foot tall, conical Indian mound at Miamisburg. Riders can follow the Little Miami Sce-nic Trail and take a detour to a castle on the banks of the Little Miami River. Other sights include a full-scale replica of the tomb of Jesus in Northern Ken-tucky and the small pleasures of pub-lic parks, covered bridges, tree-lined streets, riverside travel, and one-room schoolhouses. And if all this isn't exact-ly Paradise, well, it's pretty close.

He is professor of English at the University of Cincinnati. The Speaking Stone: Stories Cemeteries Tell is a literary love letter to the joys of wandering graveyards and the discov-eries such wanderings can yield. Here, Michael Grif th roams Spring Grove (founded 1844), the nation's third-largest cemetery, following curiosity and accident wherever they lead. The result is this fascinating collection, which narrates the lives of those he en-countered on the way. Grif th lingers amidst the traces left behind\u2014these are stories of race, feminism, art, and death, uncovered through obituaries, archival documents, and family lega-cies. Some essays focus on well-known gures like the feminist icon and free-thinker Fanny Wright, but most chron-icle the lives of lesser-known gures (a spiritual medium, a temperance advocate, the designers of caskets and hearses, the inventor of the glass-door oven) or of nearly unknown ones (a young heiress who died under myste-rious circumstances, the daring sign-painters known as walldogs). The Speak-ing Stone examines what endures and what doesn't, refl ecting on the vanity and poignancy of our attempts to leave monuments that last. Archival photos grace the pages of these thirteen essays that explore a larger, deeply tangled complex of ideas about place, history, self, and art.
