Alternative medicine includes commonly known therapies such as acupuncture and chiropractic, as well as many other, lesser-known, treatment options. Sometimes, these treatments are referred to as \"complementary medicine,\" when used alongside traditional western practices. Approximately 40% of U.S. adults say they have used some form of alternative or complementary medicine. Alternative or complementary medicine is used to treat a variety of physical and mental ailments - everything from chronic pain to stress to high blood pressure. Interested in learning more about your options outside of the doctors office? Here are 7 of the most common alternatives to traditional medicine: - Chiropractic Of course we had to start with chiropractic care... A visit to the chiropractor may not seem like \"alternative medicine\" to you. That is because chiropractic care has become mainstream, with numerous studies showing tangible health benefits. Chiropractic focuses on alleviating ailments of the musculoskeletal system, including back and neck pain. Commonly, patients receive a chiropractic adjustment, or the application of controlled force (usually from the hands of the chiropractor) on the areas around the joint. This is meant to restore joint mobility and ease muscles, fostering healing of tissue and alleviation of pain. Chiropractic care is a safe alternative or complement to traditional medicine in treating chronic pain in people of all ages, including pregnant women. Research on chiropractic care has proven its effectiveness in decreasing pain and restoring mobility. - Acupuncture You are probably familiar with acupuncture as the practice of placing small needles on the face and body to stimulate healing and promote relaxation. In fact, that is only one type of acupuncture. Other types also include stimulating certain areas of the body using methods other than needles toward the same goal of alleviating pain and stress. While there are many acupuncture practitioners in the U.S., and several studies affirm its efficacy, acupuncture remains controversial. If you decide to try it, be sure to use an experienced practitioner, do your research, and start slowly. - Acupressure Acupressure and acupuncture are part of the same family of practice, with the aim of stimulating certain points of the body to restore wellness. Acupressure involves a practitioner using their hands, elbows, or feet to put pressure on points along the \"meridians\" of the body. Acupressure theory asserts that \"meridians\" are bodily channels that are responsible for distributing life energy, or ch'i. When a meridian is blocked or off-balance, wellness is at risk. Acupressure works to restore the meridians to proper functioning, thus alleviating illness and pain. Research on acupressure is sparse, but the studies that have been done have found positive results, particularly in reducing nausea for patients receiving chemotherapy and in anxiety reduction. - Reflexology Similar to accupressure, reflexology is the practice of applying pressure to certain points on the hands, ears or, most commonly, feet. Theory states that these points correspond to certain bodily systems or organs, and positive pressure can promote healing and wellness. For example, putting gentle pressure on a certain area of the foot is purported to have a positive effect on the functioning of the bladder. Reflexology is a practice that can be done by a professional, or practiced on oneself. Around the world, reflexology is a common treatment for numerous ailments including cancer, asthma, and anxiety. Studies are inconclusive on the effectiveness of reflexology in treatment of major illnesses, but have found that it can have a positive effect on breast cancer patients. - Biofeedback Biofeedback is the manual controlling of physiological processes that normally happen involuntarily, including heart rate, tension, body temperature, and blood pressure. Biofeedback techniques are said to alleviate issues like high blood pressure and chronic pain, issues commonly tied to stress. A therapist versed in biofeedback techniques can help a patient learn basic practices that can be continued on one's own at home. Usually, a first biofeedback session includes attaching electrodes to the skin to collect measurements, but little to no equipment is required for the practice of biofeedback. Research is unclear on how it works, but shows biofeedback to be effective in relieving symptoms and issues tied to stress or anxiety. - Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is another popular form of alternative medicine that is easy to practice at home. Using a variety of essential oils, the extracts of the leaves, roots, or seeds of plants, aromatherapy is meant to enhance wellness, provide relaxation, and promote the healing of a variety of ailments, including infection or inflammation. Aromatherapy oils are most often inhaled (you can purchase an inexpensive oil diffuser online), or occasionally taken by mouth. Research has found a link between aromatherapy and reduction in pain, anxiety, and depression, but more study is needed to prove direct causation. - Naturopathy Naturopathy is a term used to describe a broad practice of alternative or complementary medicine. Doctors that practice naturopathy may also practice traditional medicine, blending the two to help patients relieve pain and increase their wellness. Naturopathic medicine takes into account not only the physical symptoms of a condition, but explores the mental and spiritual elements of it as well. Treatment techniques may include herbal medicine, nutritional adjustments, behavioral therapy, homeopathy, and acupuncture or acupressure. Because the practice of naturopathy includes such a broad range of techniques and theories, it has not been widely studied. However, the studies that have been done have shown positive results.
