Coordination of Benefits Coordination of Benefits (COB) is a process, regulated by law, which determines the financial responsibility for payment when a Member has coverage unde r more than one plan. The primary carrier pays up to its maximum liability and the secondary carrier considers the remaining balance for covered services up to, but not exceeding, the benefits that are available and the dentist's actual charge. Determination of primary coverage is as follows: For a Group Medical Insurance Qualified Health Plan: A Group Medical Insurance Qualified Health plan providing pediatric dental essential health benefits is the primary carrier for such covered services. This applies to plans provided on the California Health Benefit Marketplace and to plans provided outside such Marketplace. For Dependent Children covered under Group Dental Plans: The determination of primary and secondary coverage for Dependent children covered by two parents' plans follows the birthday rule. The plan of the parent with the earlier birthday (month and day, not year) is the primary coverage. Different rules apply for the children of divorced or legally separated parents; contact the Member Serv ices Department if you have any questions. Coverage under Access Dental and another pre -paid dental plan: When an Access Dental Member has coverage under another prepaid dental plan, whether Access Dental is the primary or the secondary coverage, PCD may not collect more than the applicable Patient Charge from the Member. Coverage under Access Dental and a traditional or PPO fee -for-service dental plan: When a Member is covered by Access Dental and a fee -for-service plan, the following rules will apply: When Access Dental is primary, Access Dental will pay the maximum amount required by its contract or policy with the Member when coordinating benefits with a secondary dental benefit plan. When Access Dental is secondary, Access dental will pay the less er of either the amount that we would have paid in the absence of any other dental benefit coverage or the Member's total out -of-pocket cost payable under the primary dental benefit plan for benefits covered under the secondary dental benefit plan. Access Dental will not coordinate nor pay for the following: HBEX -EOC-IP-CA-18 Any condition for which benefits of any nature are paid, whether by adjudication or settlement, under any Workers' Compensation or Occupational Disease law. Treatment provided by any public program, except Medicaid, or paid for or sponsored by any government body, unless we are legally required to provide benefits.
