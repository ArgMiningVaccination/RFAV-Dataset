A primary health care provider, like a doctor or nurse practitioner, is there to provide care to you from diagnosis to after treatment. They can help to coordinate your care. If you do not have a primary care provider, call 8-1-1 to try to find a provider that may be near you. You can also call the First Nations Virtual Doctor of the Day program at 1-855-344-3800. A team of health care providers may support the different needs you may have. In addition to your primary health care provider (doctor or nurse practitioner), this may include Elders, traditional healers, specialists, social workers, mental health workers, community nurses and home support workers. The treatment that is required for each person's type of cancer is unique and will be determined by factors including the location, stage and aggressiveness of the cancer. Three main types of cancer treatment are surgery, drug therapy and radiation. Every BC Cancer Centre has various support programs as well as patient and family counselling services. Indigenous cancer patient navigators may also be available. You are encouraged to reach out to your regional BC Cancer Centre to learn more about what supports are available to you.
