How to make bone broth Note: Recipe sourced from [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-bone-broth-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-215311) Ingredients: - 2 pounds mixed beef bones, short ribs, oxtails, knuckles and neck bones - 3 quarts water, plus more as needed to cover - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar - 1 large carrot - 1 large yellow onion Directions: - Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F and rinse the bones. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400\u00b0F. Place the bones in a colander, rinse under cool water and pat dry with paper towels. - Roast the bones for 30 minutes. Arrange the bones in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until golden-brown, about 30 minutes. - Cover the bones with water and the vinegar and rest for 30 minutes. Transfer the hot bones to a large stockpot. Add the water and vinegar and stir to combine. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes. - Bring the pot to a rapid simmer over high heat. - Skim the broth for the first hour. Immediately turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Check the pot occasionally, skimming off any foam that collects on the surface and adding additional water as needed to keep the ingredients covered. Cover and keep the broth at a low simmer for 24 hours. - Add the onions and carrots and cook for another 12 to 24 hours. Add the carrots and onions and continue to simmer for 12 to 24 hours more, adding more filtered water as needed to keep the bones covered. The broth is done when it is a rich golden-brown and the bones are falling apart at the joints. - Strain the bone broth. When the broth is finished, strain and cool it as quickly as possible. Set a strainer over a large pot or even a stand mixer bowl and line it with cheesecloth if desired. Carefully strain the bone broth into it. Discard the spent bits of bone and vegetables. - Cool the bone broth and store. Prepare an ice bath by either filling a sink or basin with cold water and ice and set the pot of broth inside the ice bath. Stir regularly until the broth is cooled to about 50\u00b0F, about 15 minutes. Transfer the broth to airtight containers or jars. Refrigerate for up to five days or freeze up to three months.
