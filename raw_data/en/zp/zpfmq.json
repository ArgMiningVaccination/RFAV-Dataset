Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and provides the only programmed research funds received by the University. This program facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty, supports state-of-the-art capabilities for training military medical students, and allows the collection of pilot data by the University's faculty researchers. Pilot data allow the faculty to secure research funds from non-DoD sources (est. $20-$25 million annually). Approximately 80 to 100 intramural research projects (20-25 new starts) are awarded each year, on a peer-reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the fund of knowledge intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense science and technology (S&T) programs. (U) The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions o f importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Combat Casualty Care (CCC), Infectious Diseases (ID), Military Operational Medicine (MOM), and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Medical Defense. The port folio of research projects will vary annually because this research is investigator- initiated. Examples of typical research efforts are: Combat Casualty Care: ischemia and reperfusion injury, traumatic brain and peripheral nerve injury, cryopreservation and substitution of blood components, endotoxic shock, inflammation and wound healing. Infectious Diseases: immunology and molecular biology of bacterial, viral and parasitic disease threats to military operations. These threats include E. coli and their shiga toxins, gonorrhea, streptococcus, hepatitis A, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), malaria, and bartonellosis. Military Operational Medicine: military and medical training and readiness. Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense: basic research questions concerning nerve agent intoxication and treatment.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 ILIR (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Combat Casualty Care : This program supported 24 projects in Combat Casualty Care.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) P103, University Research Initiative (URI). The URI has three primary objectives: (1) to support basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining our military technology superiority; (2) to contribute to the education of scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to defense needs; and (3) to help build and maintain the infrastructure needed to improve the quality of defense research performed at universities. Paralleling these objectives, this project, in conjunction with the other project within this program element, competitively supports programs at universities nationwide in three interrelated categories: Research . The main thrust of the URI is multidisciplinary research program of the University Research Initiative (MURI). MURI efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high -priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline; for many comple x problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application. In addition, the URI supports the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single -investig ator research efforts performed by outstanding scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Education . The URI promotes graduate education in science and engineering for U.S. citizens through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program. Through FY 1998, the URI also supported the Augmentation Awards for Science and Engineering Research Training (AASERT) program, which awarded research traineeships for graduate students and also supported laboratory experiences for undergraduate students on defense research projects. Infrastructure . URI support for the development of research infrastructure responsive to defense needs includes three programs. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) allows researchers to purchase more costly items of research equipment than typically can be acquired under single -investigator awards. The URI Support Program (URISP) broadens the base of academic institutions participating in defense research by involving institutions that historically have not received much defense funding. The third program is the Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in project P104. (U) P 104, Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Res earch (DEPSCoR). The DEPSCoR further helps to build national infrastructure for research and education in defense -critical fields by involving institutions of higher education in states that historically have not received much Federal research funding. It is executed in coordination with state committees formed for the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.

A MURI competition conducted by the Services resulted in 17 new starts in high -priority areas of multi -Service interest related to four Strategic Research Objectives identified in the DoD's corporate Basic Research Plan: nanoscience, biomimetics, compact power sources, and mobile wireless communications. Fundamental advances in these areas will enable the development of new technologies applicable to a broad range of future military systems. The multidisciplinary nature of these areas, and their multi -Service relevance, make them ideally suited for inclusion under the multidisciplinary element of the URI. In addition to the new MURI efforts, multidisciplinary and PECASE programs begun in prior years continued, with new competitive awards for PECASE programs. ( $ 117.660 Million) Education . Under the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program, 96 new graduate fellowships were competitively awarded for study leading to advanced degrees in science and engineering fields of importance to national defense. The FY 1998 competition for the AASERT program led to the award of research traineeships for more than 125 graduate students and support for the involvement of more than 50 undergraduate students in defense research. ( $ 29.003 Million) Infrastructure . More than 230 new awards were made under the FY 1998 DURIP competition, enabling the purchase of research instrumentation needed to sustain universities' capabilities to perform cutting -edge de fense research. Under the URI Support Program, efforts initiated in prior years continued in areas such as electronic and magnetic materials, image analysis, micromanufacturing, and neurodynamics. The FY 1998 competition under the DEPSCoR program resulted in 72 new awards. ( $67.937 Million) UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Selected technical accomplishments: Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, and University of Minnesota at Minneapolis used a new method to demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to detect the initiation of flaws and other potential failure sites in annular structures, such as those in helicopter rotor hubs. The method includes a theoretical model for the propagation of ultrasonic waves of multiple frequencies traveling at different velocities through a complex structure, and a transfer function to interpret the effects of cracks or other flaws on the acoustic waveform when a structure is subjected to such waves. The new method has multiple advantages over existing x-ray, destructive -testing, and pulse -echo methods for detecting cracks in annular structures: it is less expensive and faster than any of the them; it does not require removing and replacing suspected parts, as do x-ray and destructive-testing methods; and it probes the entire path through the structure, unlike the pulse-echo methods that rely on reflection of transmitted pulses from cracks or other flaws. The use of the new method will increase understanding of deterioration mechanisms in materials and structures, and should enable development of technologies for detecting and predicting microcracks and fractures in real-time. These advances underpin early detection of structural flaws to prevent catastrophic failures in ships, aircraft, and other defense systems (e.g., due to metal fatigue and wearout in rotating machineries, such as high -cycle fatigue in jet aircraft). Scientists at Tufts University, Pennsylvania State University, and Columbia developed a biomimetic \"nose\" to detect volatile organic chemical compounds at vapor-phase concentrations of tens of parts per billion, more than ten times as sensitive as previous man -made \"noses\" and approaching the sensitivity of canine noses. It also has dramatically improved signal -to-noise ratios of man -made devices. The \"nose\" is biologically inspired in that it mimics olfactory systems of dogs and other vertebrates in two new and important ways. First, it detects the organic compounds using ensembles of different receptors distributed randomly on a surface, mimicking the olfactory epithelium in an animal's nose. The receptors are polymer microspheres impregnated with various fluorophors that fluoresce in the presence of different, specific compounds. A fiber -optic bundle images the detecting surface on a charged -coupled device; the spatial pattern of the fluorescence and its temporal duration vary with the compound being detected, due to the different spatial distribution and temporal response of the receptors for that compound. The second way in which this \"nose\" mimics animal olfactory functions is in the data processing for detecting, classifying, and quantifying the compounds; it uses computational neural networks that \"learn\" the spatial and temporal pattern of the response for each chemical using algorithms that are based on those that animal brains use to process olfactory data. The new \"nose\" can detect single compounds or mixtures of various compounds. It is a major advance in detection and identification of minute traces of biochemical compounds and has great potential for application in unexploded ordnance detection, chemical and biological warfare defense, and other areas important to protecting warfighters on land and sea.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED A team at the University of Illinois and the University of Texas at Austin made three significant advances in the area of predicting radar scattering from complex surfaces. First, they extended the new Fast Multipole method to numerically solve equations of electromagnetic wave propagation and compute in a day the scattering of 3 -gigaherz radar from the Northrup/McDonnell -Douglas YF -23 (using a computer -assisted design file for the plane); this is a major advance over earlier methods, when solving a complex problem like this one, with two million unknowns, would have taken months and been plagued with errors. Second, they found a quicker way to compute scattering from nearly planar surfaces, which includes important cases such as optical gratings, scattering from very corrugated surfaces with high spatial frequencies (such as vegetation and other ground clutter), and microstrips on ground planes; for this class of scatterers, the researchers discovered a clever way to represent the problem using an integral that can be evaluated by an even faster algorithm than the standard Fast Multipole method. Third, the team devised a new Plane -Wave/Time -Domain (PWTD) algorithm that can quickly compute scattering involving wider frequency ranges, such as scattering of wideband radars. The PWTD calculation in the time and space domains can handle those problems, complementing the Fast Multipole method's Fourier transforms into the frequency domain that cannot do so. Like the Fast Multipole method, the PWTD method uses surface integrals that have major advantages over earlier methods that use volume integrals; it is faster and does not introduce the grid induced dispersion and numerical artifacts produced by the other methods. The team has extensive contacts with industry and government offices that will use the greater power and fidelity of the new methods to design low -observable platforms and target recognition systems for the DoD. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed a process to make nanocrystalline phases of iron-cobalt ( FeCo) and demonstrated that the materials have excellent soft magnetic properties that persist at higher temperatures needed for military platform applications. Soft magnetic materials are used in alternating -current devices, such as rotors of electric generators, because t hey can be easily magnetized and demagnetized in the presence of oscillating, applied magnetic fields and have correspondingly lower power losses due to hysteresis effects in those oscillating fields. The military services need soft magnetic materials as they move toward air, land, and sea platforms with more electric systems to replace fluid -cooling and hydraulic systems that require a great deal of maintenance and are a major cause of breakdowns. The new iron -cobalt materials are nanocrystalline, so they have soft magnetic properties that are superior to those of a single crystal or amorphous material; most importantly low power losses. The new materials exhibit those superior properties at higher temperatures than previous nanocrystalline soft magnets; they do so up to a Curie temperature of 970 degrees Celsius, 200 degrees higher than the Curie temperature for previous materials and high enough for applications in aircraft engines operating at 600 degrees Celsius with the needed safety margin. They also exhibit the properties at much higher magnetic fields, up to 2.1 Tesla, than earlier nanocrystalline magnetic materials; with the higher fields, generators made from the materials have higher efficiency. Thus, the new materials have good potential for application in electric systems to help increase efficiency and reduce weight, cost, and need for maintenance in aircraft engines and other subsystems for military platforms. The university researchers' collaborations with industry and national and DoD laboratories will promote transition of the research findings to potential applications.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Scientists at Clemson University, North Carolina State University, and the University of Michigan developed unique measuring and modeling capabilities and used them to begin to understand the physical mechanisms affecting quasi -optical power generation by arrays of discrete solid -state sources at frequencies of 10-100 Gigaherz. Vacuum tubes traditionally have been used to get the multiwatt powers at higher frequencies that are required for missile seekers and military communications applications, but there is interest in using solid -state devices because they are cheaper, smaller, and more reliable. The problem is that a single solid -state source produces only 0.1-0.2 watts at the higher frequencies of interest. Using networks with transmission lines to combine outputs of single sources in a brute force way works for 10 sources, but begins to drop off in efficiency for greater numbers of sources due to the complexity of the combining networks. Attempts to get the higher powers by quasi -optically combining the electromagnetic outputs of arrays of 36 -100 sources, rather than using metal connections, have yielded total power much lower than the sum of the powers of the single devices. To try to understand the problem with these quasi-optical methods, the researchers developed the first instrument that measures the electromagnetic field amplitude and phase in three dimensions near these solid-state arrays with minimal dist urbance of the field. They also developed a unique model to simulate the electromagnetic field inside and outside the array, as well as temperature and nonlinear device effects inside the solid -state material. What they found, which is entirely new and u nexpected, is that fields emitted by some sources within an array can be out of phase with those emitted by other sources, causing destructive interference in the electromagnetic field; essentially, power emitted by the former sources is being dissipated by the latter sources due to the phase mismatch. The understanding that the researchers are gaining of the fundamental physics should enable the control and elimination of the interference effects, which will improve output powers of high -frequency, solid-state arrays by factors of ten or more to the multiwatt levels needed for military applications.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) A shared commitment between industry and Government continues to be created via the Government/Industry Co-sponsorship of University Research (GICUR) program. It will capitalize on university based research, education and training in technologies of strategic importance to national defense and also to industry. It provides an emphasis on ground-breaking research with a long-term horizon, and education and training in selected research areas which are vital to advancement of technologies The commitment is a jointly formed pool of funding and a share d management structure for sponsoring this sort of long term basic research at universities. This will provide the military with leading-edge technologies as well as reducing vulnerabilities of industries involved, increase long-term technical growth in the se areas, infuse new ideas and approaches, all of which are important for national security. Industry and government share responsibility for research focus area selection and overall direction. This program will also employ advances in information technologies and telecommunications to provide extensive connectivity among the partners and research performers from the outset. Thus, strengths of individual investigators can be effectively linked, taking advantage of geographically disbursed nation al re sources. Mechanisms will be established for personnel exchange and interactions to provide for continuing education of highly qualified researchers already working in leading edge and emerging S&T. One program area implemented is on Complex Adaptive Networks. It meets the program criteria and is vital to DoD needs. The high priority thrust in this area is providing powerful mathematical and computer modeling methods to steer technology such that cascading effects and rapid, catastrophic failure of networks (e.g., battlefield communications, electrically powered ships, multisensor surveillance/ integration) are avoided. The results are of extreme importance for the Critical Infrastructures Protection national need. The second area implemented emphasizes basic concepts for DoD needs in high frequency applications such as radars, millimeter/microwave communications and radiometry, with special attention to devices fabricated from compound semiconductors, such as gal liumarsenide. This thrust is unique to DoD. The thrust is by no means limited to silicon-based CMOS (complementary metal oxide silicon) digital topics. Research here is aimed at breakthroughs to enable rapid, correct, verifiable, implementable designs of complex circuits . Interconnect research will include causes of delays and performance limits as features become smaller (for higher speed). Higher conductivity metals and very low dielectric constant materials will be investigated, as will non-conventional, innovative fabrication processes beyond present vision.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) program is a high technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). LL is operated as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) administered by the DoD, and is unique among DoD FFRDCs. It has no funding sources other than the Line for its innovative research and development efforts. This is due to the fact that LL is operated by MIT at no fee and may not charge for IR&D (under A-21). Other DoD FFRDCs do charge a fee with which they may support research efforts. (U) The LL funds research activities that directly lea d to the development of new system concepts, new technologies, and new components and materials. Historically, funding supports many development and demonstration programs which have led to such significant DoD systems as JSTARS, MILSTAR, GEODSS, as well as to solid-state devices and processes of major importance to the military industrial base. In addition to being the foundation for many new LL programs, the funding also supports other ongoing Laboratory programs with state-of-the-art technology developments. The program has the following 4 research elements: Target surveillance and recognition , with emphasis on (1) revolutionary sensing techniques and algorithms for detecting and recognizing battlefield targets both in the clear and in difficult deployments, (2) supporting data collection and phenomenology, and (3) fundamental target-recognition bounds and their implications for sensor and algorithm design.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA Lincoln Laboratory PE 0602234D8Z UNCLASSIFIED High-connectivity, low-cost military global defense network and communications systems , with emphasis on new antennas, RF technology, network protocols (including for mobile users with lightweight transceivers), high-rate fiber and free-space optical communications systems, and the interconnection of these very disparate modalities into a global defense network that can truly realize the vision of a \"from sensor to shooter\" communications infrastructure which will greatly enhance force effectiveness by providing the right information at the right time anywhere in the world; Advanced combat support technologies for hyperspectral sensing systems, Micro Air Vehicles for battlefield surveillance and compact biological agent detection systems.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program supports applied research to investigate new approaches that will lead to advancements in biomedical strategies for preventing, treating, assessing and predicting the health effects of ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with other biological warfare (BW)/chemical warfare (CW) toxicants. The premise is that DoD must be ready to conduct tactical, humanitarian or counterterrorism missions within radiation environments. Development of protective and therapeutic strategies will enable military forces to operate, when required, in nuclear or radioactive combat environments, while minimizing both short- and long-term risks of adverse health consequences. Advancements in tools to measure radiation exposure to military personnel will be us ed in triage, treatment decisions and risk assessment. Accurate models to predict casualties, particularly in combined nuclear-biological-chemical NBC environments, will promote effective command decisions and force structure plannin g to ensure mission success. (U) The program has three primary goals: (1) to understand the pathological consequences of radiation injury and radiological haza rds in order to provide a rational basis for prophylactic and therapeutic drug development; (2) to develop novel biological markers and delivery platforms for rapid, field-based individual dose assessment; (3) to define any interactions between radiation and BW or CW agents that cause more severe injury and the drugs used to protect against them -- with the goal of developing new models to predict casualties. (U) This program is executed by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) which, because of its multidisciplinary staff and facility resources, is uniquely qualified to carry out this mission. AFRRI's radiation sources allow the simulation of any radiological environment that might be encountered. Because national laboratories operated by the Department of Energy no longer support research efforts relevant to military medical radiobiology, the AFRRI is currently the sole laboratory with the combined capabilities needed to conduct this research.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 to 9.210 8.903 8.742 8.990 Number and Title: P505 Radiation Injury Assessment and Therapeutic Approach (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Developed new strategies for preventive tr eatments of both acute and chronic radiation injuries based on (a) fundamental mechanisms of cellular and molecular injury, (b) selecting less toxic drug alternatives, (c) pharmacologic quenching to reduce drug toxicity, and (d) new drug delivery alternatives.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program supports efforts in advanced technology development to provide biomedical strategies for preventing, treating, assessing an d predicting casualties from ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with biological warfare (BW)/chemical warfare (CW) agents. It is directed at the need for the Department of Defense (DoD) to be prepared to execute military missions within radiation environments, to manage radiation crises associated with terrorist activities, and for consequence management in the event of nuclear weapons detonation. The DoD is ethically committed to protection of Service members from the adverse health effects of ionizing radiation to the fullest extent consistent with operational requirements. The program incorporates findings from basic and applied research into highly integrated and focused advanced technology development studies to produce: (1) protective and therapeutic strategies, (2) tools to measure radiation exposure to military personnel, and (3) accurate models to predict casualties, particularly in combined nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) environments. This program is executed by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) which, due to its multidisciplinary staff and exceptional laboratory and radiation facilities, is uniquely qualified to carry out this mission. Because national laboratories operated by the Department of Energy no longer support advanced research relevant to military medical radiobiology, AFRRI is currently the sole laboratory in existence with the combined capabilities needed to conduct this research.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM Medical FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 to 2.130 2.007 2.057 2.091 2.133 2.130 2.007 2.057 2.091 2.133 Project Number and Title: P506 Risk Assessment and Biomedical Applications (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Completed a pilot demonstration of an improved clinical support protocol for acu te, potentially fatal radiation injury.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) P484, Counterterror Technical Support (CTTS). This program develops technology and prototype equipment that address needs and requirements that have direct operational application in the national effort to combat terrorism. It integrates defense advanced development efforts with government-wide and international efforts to combat terrorism. Projects support antiterrorism and counterterrorism activities to: conduct tactical operations; protect military forces, civilian personnel, installations, infrastructure elements and the general populace from terrorist attack; detect, neutralize, and mitigate the effects of conventional and unconventional (chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological) devices; conduct surveillance and tracking of terrorist; conduct threat and event assessments; and process and disseminate information. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict directs the CTTS Program which addresses combating terrorism requirements identified by the interagency Technical Support Working Group ( TSWG). (U) The TSWG is a multi-agency R&D working group under the aegis of the Nation al Security Council's Interagency Working Group on Counterterrorism. As such, the CTTS program supports, and is integrated into, the national interagency response to terrorism. Also, it conducts a cooperative international R&D program, and is executing projects with three countries.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense UNCLASSIFIED(U) The CTTS program develops technologies and state-of-the-art prototype equipment that have direct operation al application in the national effort to combat terrorism. Projects address the highest priority needs as dictated by current threat assessments. Documented activities and capabilities show that terrorists continue to be technologically and tactically sophisticated, which poses new challenges to our capability to respond. The CTTS program supports measures against chemical and biological terrorism and is fully coordinated with the Chemical/Biological Defense Program and the Counterproliferation Support Program. Current priorities are the detection and neutralization of terrorist-built explosive devices, countermeasures for chemical and biological terrorism, and t he detection and surveillance of terrorists. (U) Projects are structure d to address numerous technical focus areas.

Counterproliferation Support Program funds are used to leverage DoD acquisition programs to meet the counterproliferation priorities of the Commanders-in-Chief ( CINCs) of the Combatant Commands and accelerate the deployment of enhanced capabilities to the field. Specifically, the goal of the Counterproliferation Support Program is to improve specific military counterproliferation capabilities by (1) building on ongoing programs in the Services, DoD agencies, Department of Energy and US Intelligence; (2) focusing on the most critical counterproliferation shortfalls to address major gaps in deployed capabilities (as reflected in the CINCs' priorities and the Counterproliferation Review Committee's (CPRC) prioritized list of counterproliferation Areas for Capability Enhancements); (3) leveraging existing program funding to more rapidly field capabilities by accelerating the deliverables of DoD programs; (4) identifying and enhancing the development of high payoff technologies to accelerate capabilities to the warfighter; (5) identifying and promoting key non-materiel initiatives that complement technological advances; and (6) transitioning Counterproliferation Support Program projects to the Services as soon as practicable. The FY 1998 Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) directed the establishment of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) effective 1 October 1998. The DTRA will be formed through the consolidation of three existing agencies: the Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA), the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA), and the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA). In addition, several functions from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) currently involved in the management of associated programs will transfer to DTRA as well. The DTRA will also carry out programs to counter proliferation and reduce threats posed by weapons of mass destruction and provide nuclear weapon stockpile and related support. As part of this budget submission, Counterproliferation Support Program funding and manpower resources programmed for FY 1999 and out are transferred to the DTRA. A five-percent military and civilian personnel savings associated with the DTRA consolidation has already been applied and is reflected in the funding and personnel transfers to DTRA.February 1999 3 - Advanced Technology Development 0603160D8Z Counterproliferation Advanced Technology DevelopmentDATE BUDGET ACTIVITY PE NUMBER AND TITLEUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 PROJECT P535 Project P535 Exhibit R-2 (PE 0603160D8Z) SOF Counterproliferation Support 16189 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 16189 A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Project P535 - SOF Counterproliferation Support : In 1995, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) assigned the core task of countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to Special Operations Forces (SOF). The SOF Projects will develop and demonstrate SOF unique devices that enable SOF and special mission units to detect, disable and neutralize WMD and their associated facilities under the direction of a geographic combatant commander-in-chief (CINC) in support of Concept Plan (CONPLAN) 0400. These projects are to be employed by SOF units with direct application to the nation's effort to counter the spread of WMD (CP-WMD). These include efforts to defeat hard and deeply buried targets (HDBT), explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) and maritime efforts to prevent the spread of WMD technology or systems using the sea-lanes. HDBT is focused on breaching tools, improved communications, life support equipment, detection and defeat sensors, underground navigation systems, and target defeat. The EOD focus is on detection, characterization, extraction, and emergency destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) agents and devices. Efforts to seek to improve these capabilities by providing greater standoff and utilizing non-intrusive technologies. Maritime counterproliferation (CP) operations concentrate on defeating and neutralizing WMD or WMD material being transported or concealed on maritime platforms. Also included are efforts to enhance our existing capability in support of the domestic response to the WMD threat on U.S. soil. The CP-WMD effort also includes support requirements that apply to all three efforts. Under Project 535, First Responder Projects quickly leverage DoD biological and chemical response, detection and mitigation technologies to crisis and consequence management response teams such as the US Army Technical Escort Unit (USA TEU), the Navy Defense Technical Response Group (DTRG), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Secret Service (USSS) and the Department of Public Health and Safety ( PHS). These projects are executed in conjunction with the Joint Chiefs of Staff CONPLAN 0300, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflicts) and the Technical Support Working Group of the National Security Council's Interagency Working Group on Counterterrorism to ensure full interagency coordination of requirements.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Project P539 - Counterforce: The purpose of this project is to develop technologies, demonstrate prototype systems in an operationally realistic environment and provide the warfighter with enhanced capabilities in response to current threat projections for potential adversaries who have the capability to develop and/or employ nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons in future regional conflicts involving the U.S. or its allies. The U.S. requires the capability to identify and characterize NBC research, production, storage and operational support facilities and be prepared to attack and neutralize them while mitigating collateral effects resulting from expulsion and release of NBC agents. The potential target set includes fixed, aboveground and underground hardened and unhardened facilities. The project started in FY95 and was structured to exploit ongoing technology programs wherever possible. Early project emphasis was applied to efforts to predict and measure target response and dispersion of agents associated with attacks against NBC facilities using existing conventional weapons. Current emphasis is to mitigate collateral effects through advanced weapon development and greatly enhanced deliberate target planning leading to optimized weapon employment. The near-term focus is the demonstration of target planning tools, weapons and sensors supporting direct attacks on an expanded set of NBC targets. In the longer-term, the project emphasis will change to standoff penetrating weapons, collateral effects assessment and the supporting planning tools. Prototype or modified systems integrating these technologies will then be evaluated in an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), and a residual operational capability provided to the warfighters. A second counterforce CP ACTD is approved by DUSD(AT) and is awaiting signature of the management plan. The original CP ACTD has been retitled CP1 ACTD is called the Counterforce Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (CP2 ACTD). FY98 is transition year with CP1 ACTD concluding and CP2 ACTD starting. This project builds on previous Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) projects to develop and mature sensor systems to provide additional capabilities for pre-, trans- and post-attack target characterization, and damage and collateral effects assessments. The project further develops and accelerates capabilities in collateral effects prediction, target/weapon interaction prediction, and funds the integration of these capabilities into Service/CINC target planning systems. The project also builds on Service programs in advanced weapon guidance, penetration and fuze enhancements. Service weapon development expertise will be used to integrate complementary, demonstrated technologies into prototype weapons that can improve prompt response, enhance lethality and control collateral effects. The project milestones are broken into four major product areas or subprojects, sensors, collateral effects, target planning and weapons, plus the operational demonstrations. 1. Sensors . This effort will provide improved warfighting residual capabilities for facility characterization, battle damage assessment (BDA) and collateral effects assessment against the spectrum of NBC facilities. Research and development is currently in progress at DSWA to characterize signatures from shallow underground facilities for exploitation by tactical unattended ground sensors (TUGS). Objectives of the current program include development of techniques for source identification,February 1999 3 - Advanced Technology Development 0603160D8Z Counterproliferation Advanced Technology DevelopmentDATE BUDGET ACTIVITY PE NUMBER AND TITLE UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) PROJECT P539 Project P539 Exhibit R-2 (PE 0603160D8Z) UNCLASSIFIED localization, and performing change detection in trans-attack signatures for weapon effectiveness analysis. Current intelligence community (IC) and Department of Energy (DOE) programs involve research and development to assess sensor performance and approaches for optimum sensor application for surface target detection and underground facility detection and characterization. Other project activities include enhancing the performance of existing forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensors and a weapon based sensor to provide high confidence BDA. This sub-project will leverage existing programs to (1) define concept of operations and sensor system (ground, air, and weapon based) architectures for BDA, collateral effects assessment and facility characterization; (2) develop and demonstrate sensor technologies and prototype sensor systems for BDA and facility characterization; (3) produce a data fusion and processing module for BDA and facility characterization to meet user requirements on existing platforms; (4) produce an integrated BDA module to support airborne sensors; (5) develop and demonstrate a man- emplaced TUGS system that includes multi-sensor arrays; (6) integrate stand-off and point chemical sensors onto an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) and an expendable mini-UAV, respectively, and demonstrate the ability to confirm, identify, and assess the release of chemical agents in support of attacks on NBC facilities. CP2 ACTD sensors and data fusion will address confirming the presence of chemical agents post attack and assist in predicting transport patterns by updating pre-strike predictions of the potentially hazardous plume with real-time data. The CP2 ACTD sensor program will leverage on-going chemical sensor efforts within the chemical and biological defense community to minimize program risk in developing chemical sensors for counterforce missions. This program will also monitor the progress of remote biological agent detectors for potential incorporation into the collateral effects assessment system. 2. Collateral Effects . The Collateral Effects program provides predictive tools for NBC expulsion and dispersion resulting from attacks on WMD facilities as well as acts of terrorism and hostile use of WMD for a variety of applications supporting NBC target attack planning. Requirements include high resolution weather models, weather measurement systems, and population databases. A key element in developing these collateral effects codes is chemical/biological expulsion tests and modeling. Modeling of chemical/biological expulsion sources will be based on theoretical model and empirical data. Codes will be validated from existing data, other predictive models and special collateral effects experiments. The collateral effects tools will provide pre-attack prediction and post-attack assessment. The Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) is a major product that predicts the release and transport of NBC materials and the subsequent collateral effects. The high resolution weather prediction capability, another area of emphasis in the subproject, will provide timely wind, cloud, and precipitation data necessary for NBC collateral effects predictions. Weather data currently does not have the resolution or quality necessary. This weather data will also be available to other users in the theater such as Joint Warning Network (JWARN). These tools will also be integrated into the target attack planning tools to assess the consequences of attacks on WMD facilities. 3. Target Planning . This effort will provide a new deliberate planning combat assessment capability and a major upgrade for existing theater level planning capabilities for defeating or denying NBC facilities and capabilities. This effort builds upon the Integrated Mission Effects Assessment (IMEA) planning tool developed for CP1. IMEA provides a forward deployable target planning capability for NBC targets. IMEA is an integration of the Munitions Effects Assessment (MEA) tool providing targeting solutions using conventional weapons for a variety of structures and equipment and the HPAC developed under the Collateral Effects subproject. The current effort will produce the Integrated Target Planning Tool Set (ITPTS) that will provide a spectrum of planning capabilities from deliberate to crisis. ITPTS includes IMEA II and high resolution weather prediction. IMEA II will import target data and import attack assessment data from prior planned strikes. ITPTS will also predict weapons performance and associated NBC collateral effects, develop targeting solutions that minimize collateral effects, and provide the results through the appropriate interfaces for a variety of targets including functionally and structurally complex facilities. The major differences between IMEA and IMEA II is a greatly enhanced interface to theFebruary 1999 3 - Advanced Technology Development 0603160D8Z Counterproliferation Advanced Technology DevelopmentDATE BUDGET ACTIVITY PE NUMBER AND TITLE UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) PROJECT P539 Project P539 Exhibit R-2 (PE 0603160D8Z) UNCLASSIFIED Intelligence community and upgrades to handle additional target types including complex facilities, to handle additional weapons and platforms, to provide more operator friendly displays, to import attack assessment data, and to efficiently interface with Service planning systems. The ITPTS interfaces include but are not limited to Global Command and Control System, the Service targeting and strike execution control systems, strategic and tactical intelligence and sensor systems, the weather community, and the NBC warning system. A key interface for CP applications is with the Tactical Multi-Sensor Fusion (TMSF), providing critical pre- and post-strike target characterization information. The \"plug and play\" architecture is required to accommodate differing CONOPS, theaters, and performers in several geographic locations. The deliberate planning capability requires significant input from the intelligence community including data regarding NBC facilities, processes, and surrounding populations. This effort will support the intelligence community in developing the necessary interfaces to provide for the efficient transfer of intelligence data. ITPTS will include IMEA II, IMEA II Prime, an advanced wind and weather prediction capability, and a \"plug and play\" architecture. This effort will execute a full verification and validation program for all delivered capabilities including extensive field testing at all functional levels. 4. Weapons . Conventional explosive-filled weapons are often relatively ineffective in destroying large underground reinforced concrete facilities. Even if the weapon detonates inside the facility, substantial interior walls and/or floors often confine the blast and fragmentation thus causing significant overpressure and venting through the penetration hole. Likewise conventional explosive-filled weapons often result in complete and uncontrolled destruction of soft buried and aboveground facilities. When these facilities protect NBC, the random use of conventional weapons greatly increases the risk of agent dispersal that may result in extensive civilian or force casualties. This sub-project will develop, integrate and demonstrate advanced conventional weapons technologies to improve mission effectiveness against NBC facilities while mitigating collateral effects. For CP1 ACTD, these technologies include improvements in adverse-weather/precision guidance, enhanced penetrating capabilities, and advanced fuzing options. Technologies that have been successfully demonstrated will be weaponized into prototype systems. Advanced fuzes will enable weapons employment options to maximize lethality and/or control collateral effects. The focus for CP2 ACTD is to provide the warfighter with a demonstrated option to attack NBC facilities in a standoff mode. CP2 ACTD will improve on existing stand-off weapon platforms to provide enhanced penetration, advanced fuzing, and enhanced payloads that can reduce collateral effects by neutralizing agents before they are released or reducing the amount released. Standoff weapons to be enhanced include the conventional Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM-C) and the Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM). Enhanced payloads will explore alternate warhead options to conventional blast/fragmentation with the objectives of mitigating collateral effects associated with dispersal of NBC materials while also minimizing the number of weapons required to functionally defeat WMD facilities. 5. Operational Demonstrations . The Counterproliferation ACTD will improve the operational capability for holding NBC targets at risk with minimum collateral effects. The objective is to integrate available or near-term technologies for sensors, weapons, collateral effects prediction and target planning tools, evaluate the technologies in an operational context, and transition improved capabilities rapidly to warfighters. Specifically, this project will enhance and accelerate existing programs to provide integrated target planning to include collateral effects prediction codes and sensors for facility characterization and BDA, and advanced weapons development programs to meet NBC target defeat requirements. This project will also support demonstration operations to include system operational concept, demonstration planning, scenario development, execution of the ACTD and post-demonstration analysis. Planning and execution of the ACTDs uses a time phased approach to screen candidate technologies for maturity, develop prototype systems and demonstrate enhancements in military capability against a warfighter prioritized subset of all potential NBC target types. This approach results in a cycle of prototype development and testing followed by periods of operational demonstration.February 1999 3 - Advanced Technology Development 0603160D8Z Counterproliferation Advanced Technology DevelopmentDATE BUDGET ACTIVITY PE NUMBER AND TITLE UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) PROJECT P539 Project P539 Exhibit R-2 (PE 0603160D8Z) UNCLASSIFIED Two operational demonstration series were defined for the CP1 ACTD. The first demonstration, named Dipole Orbit (DO), was successfully completed in February 1997. This first demonstration used new target planning tools to determine the \"best\" employment of current weapons with a smart fuze against simulated biological agents housed in soft above-ground bermed structures. The second and final demonstration series, named Dipole Jewel (DJ), is scheduled for completion in July 1998. This demonstration will assess improved capabilities in weapons, sensors, and enhanced planning tools against a simulated, hardened chemical weapons production facility in a shallow-buried, cut-and-cover structure. After the start of CP1 ACTD, the sponsoring command identified a need to understand their ability to conduct counterforce operations against soft above-ground simulated chemical production facilities using the TLAM-C. The Dipole Tiger (DT) demonstration series was added as a quick response to the users' request. DT started in April 1997 and will end in FY98. Four operational demonstration series are planned during CP2 ACTD over the period of FY1999-2002 to provide the sponsor and participating commands with the opportunity to assess the utility of the selected technologies. The objective of the first demonstration series in CP2 ACTD, called Dipole Xeric (DX), is to employ current technology products in weapons and improved target planning tools, using new weapon delivery tactics, and operationally demonstrate their enhanced penetration capabilities against a simulated chemical agent production and storage facility considerably harder than the structure used during CP1 ACTD Dipole Jewel series. The objective of the second demonstration series, called Dipole Yukon (DY), is to exploit near -term technology by demonstrating the baseline capabilities of the Joint Air-to- Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) to conduct chemical/biological (C/B) counterforce missions through operationally realistic attacks against a simulated biological weapons storage facility. The objective of the third demonstration, called Dipole Zodiac (DZ), is to assess the suitability of the CALCM with a penetrating warhead and a Predator UAV-based standoff sensor providing collateral effects assessment. The objective of the fourth demonstration series, called Divine Canberra (DC), is to evaluate the end-to-end set of products of the CP2 ACTD including the target planning tool, in its final operational context, a TLAM stand-off attack penetrating weapon capability, and remote combat assessment using a small expendable mini - UAV with a chemical point sensor on-board (and deployed from the Predator UAV demonstrated in DZ) against a relatively hard chemical production and storage facility. DC also includes demonstration of a weaponized enhanced payload. The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is to develop an ionospheric research facility to study and exploit emerging ionospheric technology for DoD surveillance and communications applications. The specific application of this project is imaging of underground counterproliferation related facilities.

Through our funding arrangement with DOE, DoD resources are matched. More importantly, this relatively small DoD contribution effectively taps the annual billion-dollar DOE RDT&E investment by accessing the specialized skills, scientific equipment, facilities and computational tools not available in DoD. (U) The effort exploits the extensive and highly developed technology base resident in the National Laboratories relevant to achieving the goal of developing capable, cost-effective conventional munitions, and leverages DoD investments with matching DOE investments. The current program supports 43 projects in warhead technology, energetic materials, advanced initiation and fuze development, munitions lifecycle technology and demilitarization, and computer simulation. A specific Service laboratory sponsors each of these active projects. The program is administered and reviewed by a Joint Technical Advisory Committee composed of members from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OSD, and DOE. Projects are peer-reviewed semi-annually by DoD Service Laboratory/Technical Center personnel in order to monitor technical excellence and insure that the technologies under development address priority DoD needs. The program is integrated with Service efforts through the Project Reliance Weapons Panel and participation in the Defense Technology Area Plan for Conventional Weapons. The program is reviewed under the Technology Area Review and Assessment process.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Munitions (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) This development effort continues to provide improved component options for use in robust, low-cost, miniature electronic safing, arming and firing systems. The objective is to provide a set of characterized, qualified, generic components (and suppliers) and to demonstrate their use in prototype designs. The primary challenge is to significantly reduce system size and cost while increasing the operational capability and survivability and maintaining safety and reliability. A further challenge is to extend the technology to high velocity penetrating weapons and to artillery and mortar rounds. The functionality and reliability of a new semiconductor switch was demonstrated that is a factor of 5 lower in cost and a factor of 10 smaller than the vacuum switch used in current systems. The firing voltage for chip-slapper detonators was decreased 30% by using composite flyers and aluminum bridges. Lower detonator voltage allows the use of smaller, lower-cost energy storage devices and other components. The functionality of redesigned 1 kV ceramic capacitors was demonstrated for fire set application to replace custom mylar units. Capacitor costs decreased from $100 to $2-$10; size decreased by a factor of 10. These new components have been demonstrated in a working prototype electronic safing and arming device (ESAD) that is 1.25 cubic inches in size with parts cost of $120. This represents a factor of 5 reduction in size and a factor of 4 reduction in cost over current state-of-the-art technology. Multi- point detonators are the enabling technology for advanced aimable and multi-mode warheads. A 20-point design utilizing new lower energy and lower voltage Safe, Low-Input, Microslappers (SLIM) is being transferred to the Air Force contractor working on the multi-mode warhead for LOCAAS. Fast charge coupled devices (CCD) are being used to build a high-speed imaging (4000 frames/s) camera with a 512x512 pixel array for use in range-gated sensors and experiment diagnostics. Fabrication and testing of the imager at full pixel clock rate was completed. ($3.380 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense JOINT DoD/DOE MUNITIONS PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) DoD and DOE have very similar requirements for energetic materials. Both agencies desire high explosives with increased or tailored performance and decreased sensitivity. Recent accomplishments have benefited both agencies. LLM-105, a new energetic molecule that combines moderate energy with excellent insensitivity properties, was scaled up using a batch process to a 0.4-kg quantity. Instrumented shock loading tests showed a prototype formulation to be extremely insensitive, thereby increasing the likelihood of it becoming a practical material for munitions. A R&D 100 Award, given to the top 100 inventions in the US each year thought to have the greatest impact, was won for a new explosive compound that produces no smoke yet generates large quantities of gas. It is an excellent candidate material for low-signature rocket propellants. A hard target penetrator explosive, RX-35-EK, which combines nearly 50% increase in energetic performance with improved survivability, was transferred to Eglin AFB for testing. The CHEETAH 2.0 thermochemical code, used by over 250 DoD organization and contractors for prediction of the performance of high explosives (HE) as well as gun and rocket propellants, was released to users. This update tripled the database of HEs and enables CHEETAH to be used over a very comprehensive range of energetic materials problems. An initial code suite for use in multidimensional cookoff studies was completed and transitioned to the NAVY. This first-ever truly predictive capability for cookoff is composed of coupled thermal/mechanical/chemical codes for predicting when and where initiation occurs, along with shock physics tools for predicting the resulting violence of reaction. ($3.480 Million) (U) Polymeric carbon monoxide, the first of a new and potentially very interesting class of metastable High Energy Density Materials (HEDM) was synthesized under very high pressure and temperature in the laboratory and recovered for characterization at ambient conditions. Energy content of this class of materials is predicted to exceed that of known high explosives by a factor of 2 to 4. Scale-up activities and performance evaluations continued on another new class of energetic materials, Metastable Intermolecular Composites (MIC), where 500 prototype MIC-based, green (lead-free) percussion primers for small-arms ammunition were produced and evaluated by the Army; all performance specs were met. Work on a carbon/hydrogen HEDM continued. The energy storage mechanism was established and preliminary experiments showing feasibility of production scale-up were completed. ($1.060 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Eulerian hydrocodes, coupled code systems, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) codes, and supporting materials models and constitutive relations developed at the nuclear weapons laboratories, have been improved and adapted to DoD problems and transitioned to the DoD user community for use in warhead design and evaluation. This program provides prompt and direct access to the substantial investments in computational mechanics and materials modeling by the DOE and acts as the conduit for transition. Specific activities supporting the technology transition include distribution of computational tools to the DoD community, support of DOE codes on centralized DoD computing systems, training of the user community, and consulting as needed. The smooth particle hydrocode SPHINX, used for detailed endgame analyses of high-speed missile intercepts, was improved and adapted to parallel computer architectures. New materials and failure models required for this application were implemented. Material constitutive models for composites and explosives were developed using experimental data from a new Hopkinson bar made of magnesium, which allows dynamic strain rates of low-density materials to be determined. ($2.822 Million) (U) A new concept for hard target w eapons, the monolithic ballasted penetrator, has been developed that significantly increases velocity limits, penetration depth into concrete, and volume for energetic materials. The first prototype penetrator was fabricated demonstrating casting of ultra high strength alloy steel, net-shape processing and cost-effective manufacture. Preparations for testing are underway. Completed successful instrumented test of mid-scale conventional penetrator at high velocity (3500 fps) into concrete providing first detailed environmental data for components and payload at these conditions. These tests directly support the challenging problem of designing a fuze and payload that will survive high velocity impact into rock and concrete. A new level of shaped charge performance (classified), resulting from hydrocode design tools, was demonstrated. Two separate designs were developed; one of which originated from using the Global Local Optimizer (GLO) code coupled with the hydrocode CALE. GLO enhances the effectiveness of the designer approximately 10-fold. This was the first attempted use of GLO to accomplish a completely new warhead design. Both of the designs were successfully tested and achieved the predicted levels of performance. A new understanding of the influence of material properties on warhead liner performance provided the first correlation and explanation of the combined influence of material grain size and impurity concentration of liner ductility. ($3.250 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense JOINT DoD/DOE MUNITIONS PE UNCLASSIFIED(U) DoD and DOE efforts toward muni tions lifecycle technologies including stockpile aging, surveillance, demilitarization and disposal are coordinated under the auspices of this program. Work was completed on molten salt and base-hydrolysis, two competing technologies for the destruction of explosives and other organic materials. Prototype units have been constructed and delivered for pilot plant use and evaluation. The molten salt destruction of energetic materials project was completed with transition of pilot plant reactors to the Bluegrass Ammunition Depot and to Air Force Research Laboratory at Eglin AFB. A portable base-hydrolysis unit and hydrothermal unit was designed, fabricated, tested and delivered to a DOE facility for evaluation. Initial tests were performed using a femtosecond laser, demonstrating the capability to cut through HE samples, both bare and inside of a case, without any evidence of chemical reaction in the HE. These test results served to initiate a major effort to exploit the technology for demilitarization and precision machining of HE. In collaboration with a DoD contractor a process was developed for cofiring rocket motor propellant washout waste streams contaminated with asbestos fibers. The presence of asbestos is a result of the washout process. Combustion conditions and control strategies were demonstrated that burns the residual propellant and transform the asbestos fibers into amorphous, harmless magnesium silicates. A prototype robotic workcell for disassembling 40-mm projectiles was developed and delivered to McAlester Army Ammunition Plant for testing and evaluation. Age-related degradation of materials within high value weapon systems was studied in order to understand and predict changes in munitions safety, performance and reliability during long term storage. Development of predictive models for materials and system aging was begun based on evaluation of stockpile materials and components. The focus is on solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics with an emphasis on plastic encapsulated microcircuits, and the aging of propellants.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems improve the capabilities of our armed forces by enabling them to make better use of the information provided by such military sensor systems as radar, laser, infrared (IR), hyperspectral, identification friend or foe (IFF), and electronic signal measurement (ESM). ATR enhances the combat capabilities of our forces by increasing the lethality and survivability of our weapon systems and decreasing the time required to acquire and identify potential adversaries. ATR technology reduces our risk of fratricide by augmenting combat identification systems to improve our ability to distinguish between friend, foe, or neutral forces under high stress conditions. When coupled to appropriate sensor suites, ATR allows rapid detection of individual surface and buried mines and unexploded ordinance (UXO). ATR technology provides significant workload reduction for the intelligence forces by aiding the image analyst to exploit imagery rapidly and accurately. In an era of decreasing military manpower, improved ATR will enable our forces to handle an ever increasing load of sensory information in the complex situations to be encountered in the military missions of the future. (U) Increasing ATR operational effectiveness requires research and development to enhance sensors and algorithm processing. Additionally, improved, standardized procedures and metrics for measuring and demonstrating ATR effectiveness must be developed. The utility of ATR is highly dependent on the quality of the information provided by the sensor system(s) and the ability to process that information effectively to provide reliable decisions with operationally acceptable false alarm rates. Service and Agency ATR efforts have concentrated on algorithm development for conducting post-processing comparison and decision making which exploit improved digital computational capability. This program will focus on determining effectiveness of ATR, establishing benchmark metrics, and conducting and collecting single and multi-sensor data for potential reuse in Service and Agency algorithm development and objective evaluation. Consistent with the 1997 report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on ATR, this program will establish standard tests and procedures to provide an \"honest broker\" assessment of current leading candidate ATR's, as well as emerging ATR technology for the next generation of ATR systems.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 Target Recognition PE 0603232D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) The ATR program funds th e integration and demonstration of advanced technology for field experimentation and assessment. The result of the ATR program efforts is the integration of the demonstrated technological capabilities and the capability to assess algorithms and various technologies. This leads to greatly improved understanding of the Joint Warfighting utility when assessed in realistic operational contexts. The Military Services provide air, land, and naval technological superiority, respectively, and ACTDs rapidly prototype and transition technological solutions to specific threat scenarios. This program provides timely resources and flexibility to horizontally integrate technology solutions across Services and Agencies and identify new and emerging \"best-in-class\" ATR systems with confidence so that this critical technology can be fielded sooner.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments: (U) Work continued to assess key ATR metrics to find the \"best in class\" and spur fielding for critical needs identified by the Defense Science Board (DSB) and Joint Requirements Oversight Council. An ATR Transition Conference was held to address a DSB recommendation to bring developers and operators together to better understand each other's perspectives and expectations for ATR. The Virtual Distributed Laboratory (VDL) was brought on-line with the central site at Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson AFB, OH. The VDL is a high-speed network to Service sites to host test procedures, data sets, and ATR results to reduce the cycle time for ATR development and evaluation. A cooperative multi-sensor data collection, referred to as the Mother-of-All Data Collections-1 (MAD- 1), was conducted at Eglin AFB, FL in conjunction with the Air Force, Army, and DARPA. The imagery of operationally deployed target sets was used to assess Laser Radar ATR performance and is being hosted on the VDL to mature surveillance and attack ATR algorithms. The longer-term approach to provide imagery to ATR's for evaluation is to use multi-sensor synthetic imagery. For the first time, synthetic infrared imagery was input to an ATR for evaluation and its results were compared to those obtained with the corresponding real imagery as an initial step for validation. The recommendation of the OSD Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) Integrated Product Team (IPT) to establish a Hyperspectral Technology Assessment Program was implemented. The Hyperspectral Technology Assessment Program (HTAP) will lay out the framework needed to characterize the potential value of HSI systems to DoD operations, and will apply this framework to identify opportunities for near-term technology development and demonstration.

A comparative assessment of ATR's for SAR will be conducted and the results used to both establish the state-of-the-art performance and to assess concepts for performance benchmark metrics. Techniques and metrics to quantitatively describe input image difficulty, or clutter, will be developed. The program will cooperate with a service Program Manager to facilitate transition of an ATR application through enhanced evaluation techniques directed toward mission specific problem sets. \"Best Practices\" for standardized ATR evaluation and assessment will be established and promulgated through the Automatic Target Recognition Working Group (ATRWG). ATR evaluation techniques will be applied to hyperspectral imaging systems. The use of synthetic imagery for forward- looking infrared (FLIR) ATR evaluation will be validated. Humanitarian Demining Operations will be addressed through evaluation of ATR technologies developed to detect mines and UXO. More extensive multi-sensor algorithms will be evaluated. For HTAP, the two most promising application domains to pursue are 1.) tactical target detection and classification; and 2.) battlespace environment characterization, from both airborne and spaceborne sensors. Hyperspectral algorithm assessment and performance modeling will be undertaken for these two domains. ( $5.010Millio n) (U) FY 2000 Plans: (U) Standard metrics to describe ATR performance and associated problem sets will be adopted which cover surveillance, weapon, and attack applications of ATR's. The evaluation effort to determine \"best in class\" will be expanded to include more complex ATR functions such as scene analysis, and new sensor types to include hyperspectral and multi-mode sensors. Quantitative performance for hyperspectral algorithms will be established and used to refine a system level performance model. The Services' synthetic image generation capabilities will be applied to multi-spectral ATR's as a means to assess ATR performance over a wider range of operating conditions. During this time period more extensive subsystem technology effectiveness demonstrations will be conducted which support a broader range of system/platform applications. Modeling and simulation tasks will be conducted to provide software and hardware in the loop effectiveness analyses refine design requirements and manufacturing approaches. These models and simulations will be used to expand the range of tests and provide greater confidence in ATR field tests, which are limited in scope and duration, to facilitate transition to production programs. A quantitative understanding of HSI performance and operational utility will be established as a basis for future investment decisions. This timing is consistent with the current schedules for ASRP flight demos and launches of Warfighter -1 and the Navy Earth Map Observer.

This effort will support the validation of using multi-spectral synthetic imagery generated \"on-demand\" for the selected ATR in its operational scenario. The application of such multi-sensor synthetic imagery in High Level Architecture (HLA) simulations will be assessed as a technique to determine dynamically ATR effectiveness. In the hyperspectral area, an end-to-end performance model, incorporating sensor and processor models, will be validated. The end- to-end model will be used to conduct performance and subsystem trade off analyses between hyperspectral sensors and their ATR's. Service models developed to predict ATR performance will be refined to include evolving high fidelity multi-mode sensors.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) was established by Congress in 1990 (10 U.S.C . Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns. It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia. SERDP's objective is to improve DoD mission readiness by providing new knowledge, cost-effective technologies, and demonstrations in the areas of environmental cleanup, compliance, conservation, and pollution prevention. SERDP does this by (1) addressing high priority, mission- relevant, defense environmental technology needs necessary to enhance military operations, improve military systems' effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents; and (2) enhancing pollution prevention capabilities to reduce operational and life-cycle costs, as well as reducing the cost of necessary cleanup actions and compliance with laws and regulations. As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems. The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively to these priority defense needs; the pursuit of universal, world-class technical excellence; emphasis on constant technology transfer to field use; and sound fiscal management.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Strategic Environmental Research (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Pollution Prevention: (U) Next Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program (NGFSTP): This umbrella project which began in FY 1997 is part of the NGFSTP for the replacement of Halon 1301 in DoD weapon systems, the production of which was banned by the Montreal Protocol. It is divided into the following six fully integrated technical focus areas each with sequential and synergistic research elements (a total of 32 research elements). Research and development activities began in the following sub-thrust areas: Mechanisms of Ultra-High Efficiency Chemical Suppressants, Suppression Dynamics of Fine Droplets and Particles, Stabilization of Flames, Suppression System Effectiveness Screening, and Advanced Propellants/Additive Development for Gas Generators. In FY 1998, data on fires in military platforms and the outcome of these fires were received from military safety centers and a draft report summarizing these was completed. A number of compounds containing such atoms as phosphorus, iron, nitrogen, and bromine have been demonstrated to be at least as effective as Halon 1301 with little potential environmental impact. Additionally, characterization of the particle behavior in flames as a function of the individual size groupings and position in the flames of various strain is underway and fabrication of wind tunnel for flame spread experiments is completed. A successful workshop on screening methods for agent compatibility with people, materials, and the environment was held. A detailed summary of the discussions and conclusions from the workshop is available online at http://flame.cfr.nist.gov/ngp/. Also, sixteen new research elements were initiated.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: In May 1998 the Secretary of Defense appointed Commander-in-Chief, United States Atlantic Command (CINCUSACOM) as the Defense Department's Executive Agent for Joint Experimentation. Subsequently, the Department realigned resources to support ACOM's new role. FY 99 funding from this Program Element was redirected to support the initial stand-up of ACOM's Joint Experimentation Directorate. Funding for joint experiments was transferred to ACOM. Funding to support the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program concept development, the digital network infrastructure, and technology feeder support for joint experimentation was retained in this PE. Program Element 0603727N has been established to provide ACOM with their own funding source in FY 00. Consequently, the FY 98 accomplishments and FY 99 plans in this exhibit include ACOM's activities. Detailed funding changes are in section B. The Joint Warfighting PE supports three related activ ities: the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP), the Information Technology Backbone (ITB), and technology feeder support for joint experimentation. While these activities strongly support ACOM's joint experimentation efforts, a separate program element has been retained since the activities support other organizations in addition to ACOM, and they require a degree of independence from ACOM to function as envisioned.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDThe JAWP was established by OSD, with the support of the Vice Chairman of the Joi nt Chiefs, to serve as a catalyst for innovation and change. This program's focus is on assisting in the formulation and assessment of advanced concepts and capabilities, plus identifying enabling technologies and integration options for the Department. These concepts drive changes in the doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel and leadership (DOTML) of the Services. The JAWP serves a key role in identifying, exploring and evaluating breakthrough warfighting capabilities. It builds on the lessons learned from earlier Service experiments that have underscored the importance of having a firm conceptual basis upon which to build experiments. The JAWP concentrates on joint vice Service unique revolutionary concepts. In identifying and elaborating innovative Joint concepts and capabilities, and associated enabling technologies, the JAWP will not only take into account Service efforts but those of CINCs and Defense Agencies as well. The JAWP promotes integration and assists implementation. The JAWP's work complements and supports the activities of the Atlantic Command (ACOM), the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. It provides an independent source for formulating advanced concept candidates for joint experimentation. The JAWP is composed of both civilian analysts and technologists, and military operators. The civilians provide a level and quality of expertise not generally available in the Department of Defense. The active duty military provide current operational perspective to concepts under investigation and serve as a vital link to ongoing relevant activities in the Services. (U) The Information Technology Backplane provides an advanced network infrastructure that extends commercial capabilities to provide capabilities needed to meet JV2010 needs. Information Superiority is a key JV2010 building block and the ITB provides the means to experiment with the digital transmission capabilities that will be available in five years. The ITB is not a new physical network. It is a virtual network that capitalizes on existing physical networks such as the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Leading Edge Services Network, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and the experimental Advance Technology Demonstration (ATD) net. The ITB has many users from sites served by existing networks but the funding included in this PE is the incremental funding needed to support joint experimentation. For example, this PE provides the circuit costs to extend the ITB from the experimentation site to the nearest point on the backplane (where no other network exists), and only the \"extra\" backplane costs generated by the Joint Warfighting Experiments. Since joint experiments are very dependent on advanced distributed simulation, or on limited live command post exercises that are being driven by simulations, a robust network is needed to interconnect the various sites. Often times, these simulations press the state of the art in networking capability, including that of requiring Type-I encryption for protected communications. The ITB also supports new bandwidth intensive applications such as video teleconferencing and high definition television.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint 0603727D8Z third effort supported by this PE is technology feeder support for joint experiments. There are many technology demonstrations, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept and technology demonstrations that can provide advanced technologies to support joint experiments. For example, the Joint Staff has prepared 72 desired operational capabilities based on JV2010 concepts and 21st Century Challenges. For each Challenge, the Joint Staff has prepared roadmaps that provide opportunities to assess each Challenge. The roadmap for the battlefield awareness challenge shows 42 Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations ( ACTDs) that have the potential to demonstrate some aspect of a desired operational capability supporting battlefield awareness. This effort provides technology managers the resources to expand the scope of a test or demonstration to collect data for the joint staff or ACOM, thereby leveraging the OSD and Service ACTD investment. (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHM ENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (V) USACOM was officially designated Executive Agent for Joint Experimentation on October l, 1998. However in FY 98 an extensive effort was focused on four objectives: the stand-up of USACOM J-9 organization, the development of the Joint Expcrimentation process, concept development and selection, and development of the experimentation program for FY 99-01. Additionally, USACOM sponsored thc live fly portion of Information Superiority Experiment 1.1 in 4th quarter FY 1998. Leveraging thc United States Air Force's Expeditionary Forces Experiment (EFX) 98, USACOM investigated and tested new concepts and organizations to enhance Joint Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (JSEAD) against mobile targets. Data assessment is ongoing and is included in ACOM's FY 1999 Joint Experimentation program. ($4.055 Million) (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) was established in April 1998. Working for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Atlantic Command (ACOM) and their subordinate activities in support of Joint Warfighting Experimentation, it has: (1) identified key elements of a joint experimentation process; (2) began development of candidate advanced concepts for joint experimentation; (3) began development of an exemplar joint experiment; (4) developed prototype experimentation plans; (5) conducted research and seminars to classify works on future operational concepts and future security environments that are relevant to joint experimentation; and (5) planned for seminars and workshops with other government organizations to identify complimentary and supporting technology programs and activities. ($1.500 million) (U) An Information Technology Backplane (ITB) compliant with the Joint Technical Architecture, and Advanced Battlespace Information System (ABIS) was integrated and put in place, thereby providing an environment of existing information technology components into which prototypeUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting PE 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDand other emerging products can be inserted, exercised and evaluated with respect to interoperability and joint warfighting potential. The ITB builds upon existing networks and complements, not duplicates, other networking efforts by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Director Defense Research and Engineering/ High Performance Computing Management Office (DDR&E/HPCMO) and Naval Research Lab (NRL). The ITB was extended into ACOM (Joint Training, Analysis and Simulation Center) and Institute for Defense Analyses. (U) In the commercial environment, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the protocol of choice for simultaneously processing multiple applications that have huge amounts of data with low latency. ATM provides an economical method to dynamically combine large, low latency data streams like video and voice over a single transmission resource. The 98 accomplishments all relate to our efforts to evolve ATM services to meet JV2010 requirements, while still using commercial of the shelf equipment. In the network management area we provided the means to separate hundreds of switches into logical groups that can be administered by different organizations/services. Work also began on a Java-based network management tool that automatically discovers these logical groups of switches and simplifies their interconnection. In the network security area work began to strengthen the authentication needed to access ATM switch management features using Kerberos security. In the area of Quality of Service (QoS), drivers were implemented to map the Internet Protocol flows to ATM Quality of Service. We also deployed Multiple Protocol Over ATM (MPOA), which eliminates traditional router bottlenecks by creating ATM virtual circuit shortcuts. In the area of ATM applications we implemented Voice-Telephone-Over-ATM, which enables a site to carry both voice from standard handsets and data over a single network connection. In the area of test tools work began on tools that will exercise network devices to assist in lab bench testing, live network testing and network monitoring. Finally, network equipment will be acquired to support ACOM's end node, field two deployable network suites, and upgrade test beds. ($2.700 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, broken into three categories: (l) USACOM Generated Events - Events developed \"in-house' by USACOM J-9 specifically to support assessment of one or more concepts; (2) Major Leveraged Events - Events that are planned, developed and executed by CINC, Service, or Agency in which USACOM plays a major role in modifying the event to support assessment of one or more concepts; and (3) Minor Leveraged Events - Events intended to provide relatively small amounts of information in a more narrowly focused area for further development. Capitalizing on existing resources end work accomplished by the Joint Staff and Services, USACOM's FY 99 experimentation focus is to provide \"Proof of Concept\" of the Experimentation Process by conducting Joint Experiment Number I (JE-1). In addition, USACOM will leverage ongoing Service sponsored Experiments to test various warfighting concepts. In total USACOM will be involved in the execution and assessment of one USACOM Generated Event (JE-1), two Major Leveraged Events, and ten Minor Leveraged Events. USACOM will sponsor other concept development studies and Red Team vulnerability assessments. Experiment support technologies including prototypes, advanced technologies, surrogates, and integration materials will be used to support experimentation efforts. Concurrently, USACOM will host a series of Futures Seminars and Warfighter Reviews as a part of the baseline analysis on mid-term and future concepts. Analysis, modeling and simulation and wargames are an integral part of the FY 99 plan. Advanced planning for FY 00 and 01 experiments will be conducted in parallel of ongoing FY 99 experiments. ($ 10.562 M) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) will support JV2010 implementation and the Joint Experimentation work in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the Atlantic Command (ACOM) and subordinate elements. Efforts will be both on front-end identification and elaboration of concepts and capabilities, plus support for the conduct of experiments. It will continue to develop and refine candidate advanced warfighting concepts and capabilities using wargames, and modeling and simulation. It will identify promising and enabling technologies. It will collect and analyze data to support the formulation of the Department's overall Joint Experimentation efforts. The JAWP will begin to evaluate these concepts and systems through simulation, wargaming and analysis. The JAWP will help in the construct, design and conduct of joint warfighting experiments. The JAWP will have a major role in executing the simulation portion of ACOM's Joint Experiment-1. It will also participate in other experiments during the year that support advanced joint warfighting. The JAWP will look specifically at the Revolution in Military Affairs to analyze the impact of revolutionary technological concepts on doctrine and investment strategies. Workshops, seminars and conferences will be held to inform the discussions and shape the debate on future concepts and exercises. It will begin to conduct vulnerability assessments using \"Red Teaming\" techniques to identify weaknesses and avoid surprises. Transformation will also be a key focus. The JAWP will begin to identify programs, systems and methods to improve and expedite the process of executing and implementing the recommended changes, which result from the jointUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint Warfighting PE 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDexperimentation process and the development of new technological capabilities. Included in these latter activities, the JAWP will evaluate the systems and products developed during the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) for use in support a robust modeling and simulation capability which can provide near and mid term support to ACOM's experimentation activities. The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office will oversee the JAWP M&S activities to insure that they are consistent with department policy and the DOD High Level Architecture for simulations. $4.3 Million) The Information Technology Backplane will be expanded and network services and equipment will be provided to ACOM. In the network security area work will continue on the authentication system for web servers and ATM switch management. The ITB will also serve as a NSA alpha and beta test site for cryptographic testing (specifically the KG-75 Release 3 FASTLANE and the KG-175 TACLANE). In the area of ATM applications workstation voice-over-data capability will be converted to a standards based system which will allow users at workstations to conduct voice calls using the microphone and speakers attached to the computer. Work will also be continued on tools to exercise network devices, to assist in lab bench testing, live network testing, and network monitoring. A significant part of the ITB effort will provide direct support to ACOM. Circuits will be upgraded to 155Mbs and network management provided between ACOM, IDA, the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program, and Naval Research Lab (NRL). Since NRL is a physical hub, network access to other Defense Research and Engineering Network sites such as Space and Naval Warfare Center, Army Research Lab, etc, will be leveraged without cost to this program. ACOM will also be provided a distributed file system node capable of accessing high-end computing resources and sharing files across the High Performance Computing Office of the DDR&E. Coordination will begin with appropriate OSD ACTD managers and service activities such as USA-CECOM and USAF-Rome Labs to define the network architecture for ACOM's Joint Contingency Force experiment in FY 00. ($1.817 Million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support: ACOM's Campaign Plan, dated 1 December 1998, provides the list of ACOM generated events, major leveraged events and minor leveraged events for FY 99-01. The next step is to develop detailed concept papers for each of the eight concept areas that ACOM is pursuing. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems and Concepts) in coordination with ACOM and the Joint Staff will assist in determining which ACTDs, ATDs, and/or Technology Demonstrations best support ACOM's experimentation events. This funding will be provided to the selected technology managers to support a joint experiment. Funding will be provided for efforts such as system integration, and logistics and test support. ($2.00 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, continue to build on its FY99 efforts to support the Department's Joint Experimentation efforts. The focus will be on increased involvement in additional Service/joint exercises and the Atlantic Command's (ACOM) Joint Experimentation activities, with emphasis on advancing the understanding of specific concepts and in conducting experimentation. Opportunities will be identified to leverage and integrate Service and other agency programs, as well as activities such as Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations. Data collection and independent analysis will be conducted and used to produce reports and papers intended to inform the OSD, Joint Staff and ACOM leadership of experimentation results and to make recommendations for future activities. In addition, the JAWP will identify breakthrough concepts and technologies that could produce revolutionary future warfighting capabilities. Vulnerability assessments and \"Red Teaming\" will be conducted to improve the validity and robustness of experimentation. A major effort during the FY will be a focus on the transformation process. The JAWP will work on the identification of vehicles and opportunities that can be used in the early transition of new concepts and technologies in to actual operational military capabilities. ($4.300 Million) (U) The ITB will continue to be upgraded to reflect emerging protocols that show promise from advanced research network testbeds. In the area of network management Kerberos authentication will be extended into Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3). In the area of applications, the capability for a workstation voice user to communicate with a standard handset voice user will be provided. Efforts in support of ACOM will continue. Selected circuits will be upgraded from 155Mbs to 622Mbs. This will enable experimentation with \"killer applications\" such as High Definition Television (HDTV), which produces data at gigabit per second rates. Lower bandwidth, high quality HDTV will be purchased and installed at key sites. HDTV provides mission planners and commanders the ability to observe real-time or near-real-time temporally meaningful data. ACOM will be provided with the network infrastructure that supports their Joint Contingency Force experiment. ($1.572 Million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support for Joint Experimentation will continue. ACOM's Campaign Plan 00, which will be published in April 99, will provide additional experimentation detail and refinements to the current plan. Integrated concept teams will have had the opportunity to prepare more detailed experimentation and assessment plans. Once the concepts and experimentation plans are more clearly articulated, technologies supporting the experiments will be identified. It is anticipated that plans for the Joint Olympic event in the FY 04 timeframe will become clearer and work will be begin to align the technologies supporting this major integrating exercise. Once again, this funding is only intended to leverage ongoing developments to support joint experiments, and not to fund the development itself.($2.000 Million) (U) FY 2001 Plans: (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) will continue support of the Department's Joint Experimentation activities. It will mature those promising concepts developed and demonstrated during the previous two years. It will exploit successes and continue to serve as a catalyst for change and transformation.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : The Department of Defense recognizes the need to rapidly develop and field new technological capabilities, and to explore new and innovative operational and organizational concepts associated with those capabilities. Such advances are critical to the objective of achieving a \"revolution in military affairs\" to support the Chairman's Joint Vision 2010 . Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) are low risk vehicles for pursuing that objective. ACTDs are capability demonstration and evaluation programs in which the development and employment of technology and innovative, operational concepts by the military user are the primary focus. The demonstrations involve a material development organization that develops the technology, and a warfighting organization responsible for assessing the military utility. In addition to stimulating innovation, ACTDs offer three other significant opportunities. They provide experienced combat commanders with an opportunity to develop operational concepts and operational requirements to fully exploit the capabilities being evaluated. They allow the users an opportunity to assess the military utility of the proposed capability prior to a major acquisition decision. They also provide the Services with a mechanism for compressing acquisition cycle time, thus significantly improving their response to priority operational needs. As such, ACTDs are at the foundation of the DoD acquisition reform process. In FY 1999, ACTDs also became an integral part of the Joint Warfighter Experimentation process. U.S. Atlantic Command's (ACOM) Joint Experimentation Plan 99 identified twelve ACTDs in its near-term experimentation matrix. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advance Systems and Concepts) (DUSD/ASC) is working closely with ACOM in preparing Campaign Plan 00 to insure ACTD work to integrate technology and develop new concepts of operation is fully leveraged and integrated into future joint experiments. (U) Other sources provide most of the funding for ACTDs. Funding from this program element, typically 10 to 20%, is used: 1) to support actual demonstrations and exercises, 2) to provide hardware to demonstrate military utility, and 3) to fund interim capability operations and support for two years after the \"operational demonstration phase\" of the ACTD. This two-year phase provides the operators with adequate time to continue to address the issues of supportability, maintainability and training identified by the ACTD.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date: February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 PE 0603750D 04/09/99 9:48 AM UNCLASSIFIED(U) Both the Science and Technology (S&T) and the warfighter communities submit candidate ACTDs in January of each year. The candidates proposed by the S&T community reflect technological opportunities that have been enabled by recently demonstrated technology. The candidates proposed by the warfighter community (Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Unified Commanders in Chief (CINCs), Service operational organizations) respond to a deficiency in military capability or to an emerging military need. For each candidate, it is necessary to confirm that the proposed concept is based on technology that is sufficiently mature, and that the capability addresses a priority military need. (U) The maturity of the technology associated with the proposed capability is assessed by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems and Concepts (DUSD (ASC)), with assistance of senior members of the science and technology community (known as the Breakfast Club). The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) determines the military need by prioritizing the ACTD candidates. The principal management tool for the ACTD is the ACTD Management Plan. Each approved ACTD will be described in a top-level document that provides details of the demonstration/evaluation, the main objectives, approach, critical events, measures of success, transition options, participants, schedule, and funding. (U) The typical timeline of two-to-four years for the operatio nal demonstration phase of an ACTD is compressed compared to normal timelines for fielding an operational capability. These shorter schedules are made possible by the fact that the ACTDs incorporate mature or nearly mature technology and, therefore, forgo time consuming technology development and technical risk reduction activities. At the end of the ACTD, the user sponsor is able to determine if the capability provided by current technology has sufficient utility to warrant procurement; if there are significant shortcomings, either to pursue an advanced technology demonstration to improve performance, or not to pursue the technology any further at this time. In cases where the operational user is satisfied the prototype has significant utility, the prototype can be used as an interim capability and then move quickly to enter the formal acquisition process and to acquire quantities to fully satisfy the need. (U) The request for Fiscal Year 2000 candidate ACTDs was issued October 1998. Proposals were rec eived from the CINCs, Services, other Department of Defense Agencies, and industry in January 1999. Candidates are organized into the Joint Vision 2010 focus areas of Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, Full Dimensional Protection and Focused Logistics. Plans are being finalized with the Joint Staff to begin the process of identifying and reviewing the candidates for FY 2000 ACTDs in February/March 1999. Funding for FY 2000 ACTDs is approximately $10 million. (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS : (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments : All ACTDs initiated in FYs 1995, 1996 and 1997 have been reviewed for objectives, content and management. This includes in-depth review by some of the ACTD operational sponsors such as United States Atlantic Command (ACOM). Fourteen new ACTDs were started in FY 1998: Adaptive Course of Action, Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) for Coalition Warfare, High PowerUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date: February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 04/09/99 9:48 AM UNCLASSIFIEDMicrowave, Information Assurance: Automated Intrusion Detection Environment, Joint Biological Remote Early Warning System, Joint Continuous Strike Environment, Joint Modular Lighter System, Line of Sight Anti-Tank System, Link-16, Migration Defense Intelligence Threat Data System, Precision Target Identification, Space Based Space Surveillance Operations, Theater Precision Strike Operations and Unattended Ground Sensors. The selection process for FY 1999 ACTDs began in October 1997. Thirteen final ACTD candidates, of the 37 received from the Unified Commands, the Services and Defense agencies, were considered for final selection. Candidates covered a broad range of technologies and needs, including logistics, intelligence, medical protection and telemedicine, information technology, mission planning, battle damage assessment, automated maintenance, personnel recovery and air defense. These candidates were evaluated for technical maturity by the Breakfast Club and for operational need and utility by the Joint Staff Joint Warfare Capability Assessment (JWCA) process. The JROC then prioritized these thirteen candidates and eleven were finally selected based upon funding availablity. In order to validate technical maturity, program planning and program management, each final candidate underwent a one-day comprehensive review (termed a 'final scrub') prior to final selection and ACTD start in early FY 1999. FY 1998 funds were transferred to the executing services/agencies in the amount of $74.756 million. (U) 1998 accomplishments include: FY 1995 Starts: Advanced Joint Planning (AJP): Developed software tools that provide the insight into readiness of component forces and the ability to manage Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) demonstration on a daily basis at U.S. Atlantic Command (ACOM). Utility of these tools (Time- Phase Force Deployment Data Editor ( TPEdit), Force Modual Editor ( FMEdit), Force Module Editor ( FMEdit), Course of Action Selection Tool (COAST), Target, Automated Joint Monthly Readiness Review (AJMRR), and the Joint Readiness Assessment Management System (JRAMS)) has been successfully completed. TPEdit, FMEdit, COAST,and Target have been delivered to Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) D6 for final testing and fielding. JRAMS has been distributed to several CINCs for demonstration of improved responsiveness and accuracy of the CINC readiness assessment. Both JRAMS and AJMRR were delivered to DISA D6 in November 1998. High Altitude Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (HAE-UAV): Successful first flights for both Global Hawk and DarkStar air vehicles were conducted. Global Hawk Air Vehicles #1 and #2 have flown a total of ten air worthiness and payload test flights at Edwards AFB CA for a total of 50.4 hours. Eight of the ten flights have reached altitudes in excess of 50,000 feet. The latest flight was the first payload mission on 22 Jan 99; the Global Hawk Integrated Sensor Suite (which includes three different types of sensors) successfully used these sensors to gather 'spot' and 'swath' imagery, and also transmitted the imagery via satellite communications to a ground station in San Diego CA. DarkStar has completed five successful airworthiness test flights to date totalling 6.1 hours. Four of the flights went to 5000 feet in altitude; the latest flight on 9 Jan 99 flew for 2.7 hours and 25,000 feet in altitude Joint Countermine (JCM): Completed Phase II and the second demonstration during MARCOT/Unified Spirit 98 on 6-26 June 1998 in Stephenville, Newfoundland, Canada. Demonstrated ten novel systems, C4I integration, and legacy systems during the operational exercise.

In addition in August 1998, ACOM sponsored Warfighter Analysis Laboratory Experiment to allow warfighters to apply lessons learned during a simulated exercise. Several land based countermine systems were also demonstrated in JTFEX 98-1 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina in February 1998. ACOM published its military utility assessment in October 1998. Precision Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Targeting System (PSTS): Completed a final demonstration phase in Korea in September 1998. The PSTS integrated airborne and National SIGINT to achieve accurate geolocation of emitters. The demonstration included upgraded capabilities for the U.S. Army GUARDRAIL system, processing software and communications links. The ACTD leaves a limited operator capability and transitions into a long-term program to upgrade all airborne and National SIGINT systems to provide precision geolocation of Electronics Intelligence (ELINT) and Communications Intelligence (COMINT) emitters. Rapid Force Projection Initiative (RFPI): Completed the full scale demonstration phase in August 1998. This demonstration incorporated new sensor, shooter and command and control technologies into the nation's light, first-to-fight forces. The demonstration concluded with a large free- play engagement between a brigade of the 101st Air Assault Division and a combination of real and virtual opposing forces. The new capabilities that were demonstrated included the Hunter Sensor Suite, Remote Sensory, Integrated Acoustic System, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Automated 155 Howitzer and digital command and control in the form of a Light Digital Tactical Operations Center (LDTOC). These components will be entering an interim capability and transition phase. Synthetic Theater of War (STOW): Participated in a major operational exercise in support of ACOM and began transition of STOW technologies to the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) and the Services. In all supported events to date, STOW has been distributed among many sites that interface to it via operational command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) systems. This integration allows realistic interaction between real-world planning and simulated combat implementation. STOW has achieved new milestones in the number and fidelity of entity-level simulations. FY 1996 Starts: Air Base/Port Biological Detection: Conducted Aerosol Background Environmental Sampling at four U.S. installations in Central Command (CENTCOM)/Pacific Command (PACOM) areas of responsibility. At CENTCOM request, the ACTD prototype network was deployed for Operation Desert Thunder. It was operational for 24 hours a day, ran for over 3000 hours with zero network false alarms, and less than one half of a percent of false positives. In addition, the Mark-III sensors have been reduced 25% in size and 35% in weight. Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination (BADD): Installed a software package at multiple sites providing an integrated environment of broadcast management, information dissemination management, and battlefield awareness service that provide near-real-time imagery, geographic and video products at transfer rates ranging from hundreds-to-thousands of times faster than current capability.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) The purpose of the Commercial Technology Insertion Program (CTIP) is to reduce ri sks and increase opportunities for the insertion of commercial technologies into defense systems. By supporting the required nonrecurring engineering, test and qualification, CTIP enables commercial components to be used confidently in weapon system applications. By demonstrating open system architectures that take advantage of the latest commercial technologies, CTIP increases the ability of defense systems to avoid parts obsolescence and keep pace with commercial technology advancement. Commercial technologies selected for insertion through this Program apply to more than one weapon system and will reduce life cycle costs and improve performance, reliability and maintainability. This Program implements the Department's strategy for using more commercial technologies in military equipment. (U) The Program is managed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and executed by Service program offices. Proposed projects for the insertion of commercial technologies and demonstration of open architectures in defense systems are selected by the Services and approved for funding by the OSD. The systems selected as initial applications are planned/ongoing development and modification programs. CTIP has defined two major thrust areas for the FY 97-99 program: P795 - Commercial Technology Insertion for First Use Military Applications and P796 - Open Systems Demonstrations to Expand Commercial Insertion Opportunities.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 Program PE 0603752D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) P795. The first thrust eliminates barriers to the insertion of a commercial components in a military system. DoD program managers are often reluctant to take the risk of using parts whose characteristics in a military operating environment have not been tested and validated. The business case often does not exist for a single program to make the required investment in adapting and testing commercial items. As a result, military unique items continue to be selected by designers of defense systems, leading to higher costs, lower reliability, increased parts obsolescence, and often lower performance than commercial alternatives. CTIP addresses this problem by providing the engineering and qualification testing needed for the \"first user\" program, thereby reducing the risk and expense to an acceptable level for follow-on programs. CTIP also provides information to users on test and operational experience with commercial parts in military applications. Two projects were initiated in the first year of the program: (1) commercial microelectromechanical sensors for fuze, safe, and arm devices, with initial applications for undersea weaponry and missiles, and (2) commercial analog to digital signal processing architecture for the F-15 radar. (U) P796. The second thrust focuses on the system engineering of open system architectures (OSA). OSA are based on commercial market developments and standards. This thrust demonstrates the effectiveness and suitability of these open architectures for use in weapon systems. The purpose is to increase the opportunity for insertion of commercial subsystems and components from sources other than the original equipment manufacturer, and to facilitate upgrades over the life cycle to keep pace with commercial technology advancement. Defense system architectures are often proprietary system solutions that make parts substitution and future upgrades difficult. By contrast, the best practice in the commercial sector is to rely on open system standard interfaces that make upgrading faster, easier and less expensive. Commercial interfaces apply to computer hardware and software and to other electronic, electrical and mechanical attributes.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM Element (PE) Cost18.000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Continuing Continuing Commercial technology Insertion for First Use Mili/P7958.905 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Continuing Continuing (U) Project Number and Title: P795 Commercial technology Insertion for First Use Mili (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Expanded testing and qualification of commercial MEMS sensors for application to Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM) and Low Cost Competent Munitions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program (HPCMP) directly supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing the highest computational power available to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers. By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems quicker and with more precision than any potential adversary threatening national security. The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by increasing our fundamental understanding of the battlefield environment as well as improving upon weapon system design, development, test, evaluation, deployment, operations and sustainment. As such, high performance computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's Science and Technology (S&T) and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) programs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE January 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING MODERNIZATION PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) The HPCMP has established and suppo rts four major shared resource supercomputing centers as well as several smaller, special-purpose distributed supercomputing centers. These centers directly support the DoD S&T and DT&E laboratories and centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access. Providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely-used applications and algorithms to address S&T and DT&E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve, is an integral part of the program. The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academe, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise. (U) The HPCMP user base includes approximately 4,300 computational scientists and engineers and over 60 DoD laboratories and developmental test and evaluation facilities. The integrated HPCM program consists of a set of four large Major Shared Resources Centers ( MSRCs) that are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD's S&T and DT&E computational workload as feasible. These MSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, programming environments, and training. A limited set of smaller shared resource centers, Distributed Centers ( DCs), augment the MSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. Distributed Centers address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at MSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC expertise located at the remote sites. The MSRCs and DCs are currently interconnected with all S&T and DT&E user sites via the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). Additionally the Common HPC Software Support Initiative (CHSSI) develops a set of critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems at the MSRCs and Distributed Centers. (U) True modernization of DoD's HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC. While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting and related support systems. The goals of the HPCMP are to: Provide the best commercially available, state-of-the-art HPC capacity and capability to enable weapons development and more capable warfighting systems, Ensure development of software tools, supportive programming environments, and applications to exploit the capabilities of HPC, Expand and train the DoD HPC user base to more effectively use HPC, Link users and HPC centers through robust high speed networking (thus facilitating classified and unclassified access and the creation of collaborative work environments), and Engage, leverage, contribute to, and be a major participant in the national HPC infrastructure and exploit benefits for Defense R&D.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE January 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING MODERNIZATION PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Four major contracts to support each of the MSRCs were competitively awarded during FY 1996. These contracts provide equipment for up to five years and comprehensive support services for the next five to eight years. The four MSRCs and their location are: Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station (CEWES), Vicksburg, MS Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO), Stennis Space Center, MS (U) Nichols Research Corporation of Huntsville, AL was awarded contracts to support both the ASC and CEWES MSRCs. Grumman Data Systems of Herndon, VA was awarded the contract to support the NAVO MSRC. Finally, Raytheon E-Systems of Garland, TX was awarded the contract to support the ARL MSRC. Each of the MSRC contracts contains provisions, i.e. established contract options, to allow significant expansion of high performance computing systems and related support systems over the first five years of the contract. These contract options ensure that MSRC system expansions can take place in a timely fashion during each fiscal year. (U) There are currently 12 distributed centers. In FY 1998 five existing centers were upgraded. In FY 1999, one distributed center was retired. Also in FY 1999 multiple distributed center proposals will be evaluated resulting in three to five awards. The distributed centers and their locations are listed below: Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN Air Armaments Center (ARC), Eglin AFB, FL Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC), Minneapolis, MN Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC), Maui, HI Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), Patuxent River NAS, MD Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSCSD), San Diego, CA Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL-Rome), Rome, NY Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), Huntsville, AL Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), Warren, MI White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NMUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE January 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING MODERNIZATION PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC), Huntsville, AL (U) In addition to the distributed centers listed above, the Arctic Region Supercomputer Center (ARSC) has been funded by Congress in FY 1996, FY 1997, 1998 and FY 1999 and is providing computational resources to the HPCMP user community. (U) The Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) provides wide area network (WAN) connectivity among the Department's High Performance Computing resources (high performance computing systems and the HPC user base of scientist and engineers in the research, development test and evaluation community). The DREN is implemented through the DREN Intersite Services Contract (DISC) awarded to American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) in FY 1996. This contract allows the government to purchase high-speed network service to anywhere in the United States at bandwidths ranging from 3.0 megabits per second to 622 megabits per second (OC-12), with upgrade potential to 2.4 gigabits per second (OC-48) over the five year life of the contract.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE January 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide / BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE HIGH (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Shared Resource Centers: The program continued the modernization and sustainment of the Shared Resource Centers. Additional HPC systems, storage, and scientific visualization capabilities were acquired to populate and upgrade the established MSRCs to fulfill a substantial portion of the projected HPC requirements of the laboratories and R&D centers. Contract options were executed to upgrade performance at four MSRCs, minimally tripling their computing capability over the two year period (FY 1997 and FY 1998). The program assessed and prioritized HPC requirements for DCs and deployed new systems at five existing DCs to accomplish S&T and DT&E mission needs which cannot be met effectively or efficiently at the MSRCs. (U) Networking: The DREN fully replaced the Interim DREN in FY1998. The DREN started operation with 10 service delivery points on 1 July 1997. By the end of FY 1998, a total of 60 government facilities and 4 Internet network access points ( NAPs) will be connected via DREN. Full Internet Protocol (IP) service is extended to all sites and more robust Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) ATM services are provided to sites with local infrastructures capable of supporting these services (21 sites). Current communications bandwidths provided to sites range from 3 megabits per second to 155 megabits per second. Collaborative work continued with the Federal networking community to assure DREN remains compatible with future technology changes.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office has corporate-level responsibility for the cooperation and synergism of modeling and simulation (M&S) activities within the Department of Defense. M&S has demonstrated the capability to revolutionize the way in which the Department makes decisions and conducts its operations. Working as a system of systems, M&S can support a full range of applications (e.g. joint training, doctrine development, formulation and assessment of operational plans, mission rehearsal, force structuring and the acquisition of new systems). To ensure effective and efficient use of M&S, the Department has developed a strategy fostering interoperability and re-use, embodied in the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation Master Plan, which serves as the basis for execution of this program. The major element of the strategy is development of a common technical framework (CTF) for M&S consisting of three components: the High Level Architecture (the most important); Conceptual Models of the Mission Space (CMMS); and Data Standardization. Supporting these is a broad range of shared common services which include environmental representation; human and organizational behavioral representation; verification, validation and accreditation of simulations; a modeling and simulation resource repository; a modeling and simulation operational support activity; and outreach and education initiatives to ensure standardized and timely implementation of the plan. As a result of this effort, the Department will be able to improve readiness, enhance mission rehearsal, optimize investment decisions, and achieve cost-effective acquisitions.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE JSM (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1998 Accomplishments: (U) Continued development of support software for testing and Federation Object Model (FOM) developmen t; incorporated modification to legacy systems to interoperate through the HLA; completed competitive procurement process for Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) software; continued development, integration, test and standardization; began HLA compliance testing and simulation certification.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 4 based on the demonstration/ validation activities ongoing within the program. The purpose of this program is to develop physical security equipment (PSE) systems and to safeguard DoD acquisition information for all DoD components, to include Force Protection. This program supports the protection of nuclear weapons, tactical and nuclear weapons systems, DoD personnel and DoD weapon systems. Funding for critical RDT&E security improvements within service channels has fluctuated widely over the years and prompted the consolidation of the Services and former Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) PSE RDT&E funds into this single OSD controlled program element. This program was originally formed by the Congressional consolidation of the three Services and the former DSWA RDT&E PSE budget submissions for FY 1989. The funds are used to provide PSE RDT&E for individual Service and joint PSE requirements. The PSE program is organized so that an ongoing DoD-coordinated Joint Action Group, consisting of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) representatives monitor, direct, and prioritize potential and existing PSE programs. With few exceptions, each Service sponsors RDT&E efforts for technologies and programs, which have multi-service applications. In several cases, applications are unique to only one service. The funds are also employed to evaluate exploratory development of Physical Security Equipment. This program element supports the Army's advanced and engineering development of Interior Detection, Exterior Detection, Security Lighting, Security Barriers and Security Display Units. In a like manner, the program element also supports the Air Force's PSE RDT&E effort in the area of Exterior Surveillance, Entry Control and Airborne Intrusion. Finally, the program supports Navy RDT&E efforts in the areas of Shipboard Security, Waterside Security, Explosive Detection, Locks and anti-compromise and emergency destruction of classified material equipment. Concerns regarding the protection of DoD weapon systems acquisition information at DoDUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 1999 RDT&E facilities has led to an expanded role for this Program Element since FY 1995. Beginning with FY 1997, this PE includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) evaluation and testing, which has received focus since the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing incident. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies, which are considered effective for DoD use.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The program element provided funding for large scale, high leverage demonstrations of the integrated application of existing commercial and DoD technologies, practices, standards and products for order of magnitude weapon system affordability and support improvements. Demonstrations were selected to 1) measure the risks and show the feasibility of payoff from selected technology applications and 2) show novel or unorthodox alternatives to conventional weapon system acquisition and support. Demonstrations showed technology applications which provide a highly integrated and automated set of weapon system support capabilities (built in test, factory, depot, and test equipment, technical information, etc.). The demonstrations were intended to lead to reduced maintenance man-hours, \"per weapon system\" deployment tails, and weapon system acquisition and ownership costs. The demonstrations examined leveraging industry manufacturing processes and integrated acquisition processes/technology approaches to address systemic weapon system production and support affordability drivers. The projects have demonstrated the value of incorporating integrated diagnostics approaches for weapon systems support and the methodologies used to acquire and manage diagnostics. After recognizing the value and the low risk of this approach, Service weapon program managers have begun or are planning to incorporate integrated diagnostics in new platforms such as the JSF, F/A-18E/F, surface combatant ships, and missile defense. The program was also instrumental in establishing DoD Automatic Test System policy. This program has achieved its original goal to \"seed\" these approaches in the acquisition community, therefore the Department concluded this program. B. Program Change Summary: The Department has concluded this program . C. Other Program Funding Summary : Not Applicable D. Acquisition Strategy : As preconditions to initiating a demonstration, Service managers committed to provide the R&D or procurement investment to transition the products to the selected demonstration field weapon system fleet and to incorporate products and concepts into new weapon systems designs for long-term payoffs.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 4 based on the demonstration/validation activities ongoing within the program. This PE was established in response to Congressional guidance to consolidate DoD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to increase focus of the Services' robotic programs on operational requirements. The program will demonstrate maturity of robotics technologies for their application to the formal acquisition process of land systems and subsystems. Emphasis is on the development of robotic technologies that: are amenable to multi-service applications; provide capability in high hazard environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability; reduce or enhance force manpower and support; and are affordable. This PE consolidates the DoD robotics program for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) into two activities: (1) advancement of UGV concepts into Advanced Development (AD) acquisition projects and (2) the enhancement and exploitation of critical robotic technologies for today's and future UGV acquisition requirements. Categories under this PE are: (1) Man Portable Robotic Systems (MPRS) - consolidated efforts to develop smaller (10-40 lb. Class) UGVs in response to emerging user requirements. Two MPRS programs are underway: the Basic Unexploded Ordnance System (BUGS), which is a joint service effort to locate and dispose of surface UXO; and the Outdoor Miniature Robotic Ground Vehicle (OMRGV), which is a small robotic vehicle for reconnaissance and other hazardous tasks in special operations or light infantry missions; (2) the Robotics Ordnance Clearing System (ROCS) - a USAF effort to develop a robotic/autonomous vehicle capability for area clearance, including active range clearance (ARC). Platforms include the following: All-purpose Robotics Transport System (ARTS), Subsurface Ordnance Characterization System (SOCS), Automated Ordnance Excavator (AOE), and Joint Amphibious Mine Countermine (JAMC). This technology can also be applied to formerly used defense sites for cleanup/disposal; (3) the Technology Enhancement program (DEMO III) is centered upon the enhancement and exploitation of critical robotics technologies for today's and future UGV acquisition requirements. DEMO III, in part a follow-on to the very successful DEMO II program, is a four year effort to further advance semi-autonomous technologies; and (4) the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Ground Systems (JAUGS) which is a software-standards oriented approach to standardizing all aspects of protocols and approaches to the software aspects of all anticipated DoD unmanned systems.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 1999 (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments VEHICLE TELEOPERATION (VT) (11.500 million) Obtained favorable MS I/II for entry into combined Program Definition/Risk Reduction (PDRR) /Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase Awarded Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase III contract to enter combined PDRR/EMD phase in support of VT acquisition program Developed final Performance Specification for MK4 (EMD) VT kits, and initiated configuration control Developed, built, and demonstrated Standardized Teleoperation System (STS) kits for M9 Armored Combat Excavator (ACE), D5, and T3 bulldozers Completed initial development testing for the STS Completed Limited User Testing for STS on the M-1 tank, and the D7G, D5, T3, and M9 ACE bulldozers Increased involvement with USMC and USAF Started design/development of Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) for US Army Engineer School (USAES) Defined VT requirements for the USAF, USMC, and USN TACTICAL UNMANNED VEHICLE (TUV) (4.685 million) Finalized System Specification for TUV and developed a Draft Request For Proposal (RFP) for EMD Continued long-term User Appraisals in support of Evolutionary Acquisition Strategy Improved reliability performance in SARGE prototype for participation in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) Advanced Concepts Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Trained USMC Chemical, Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) and integrated robotics into contingency exercise training JOINT ARCHITECTURE FOR UNMANNED GROUND SYSTEMS (JAUGS) DEVELOPMENT (0.200 million) Continued to update JAUGS based on technology improvements, Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) standards established by DoD, and mission requirements Coordinated JAUGS activities closely with 4D/RCS and Demo III development efforts Began validation process on the JAUGS Incorporated JAUGS as a requirement in the TUV contract requirements package Incorporated JAUGS into the VT contract Commenced planning and coordination for the configuration management of JAUGSUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 1999 U) FY 1999 Plans JOINT ARCHITECTURE FOR UNMANNED GROUND SYSTEMS (JAUGS) DEVELOPMENT (0.400 million) Evolve, refine, and update to achieve greater autonomous capability.

The Demo III Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Program is designed to advance and demonstrate the technology required to develop future unmanned ground combat vehicles through three major thrusts: (1) concerted technology development; (2) modeling, simulation and experimentation; and (3) technology integration and evaluation with users. Demo III focuses on demonstration of technology that will enable the development of small, highly agile, unmanned vehicles capable of off-road, semi-autonomous operation at speeds of up to 32 km/hr during daylight and 16 km/hr at night by 4Q FY 2001. Demo III supports development of two emerging ORDs at the U.S. Army Armor School for a robotic scout system and a robotic leader-follower system. Technologies for these systems are applicable to a wide array of Army programs. (U) FY1998 Accomplishments : Concerted Technology Development: The technology development community, drawn primarily from government laboratories such as NIST, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and ARL, has organized itself into a series of working groups to address six technology areas deemed critical to the success of the program. The primary focus of the effort has centered on the development of perception for autonomous mobility; algorithms for local planning and autonomous behaviors; an intelligent software architecture and a small, highly capable control interface that can be integrated into standard display units. A development plan that will provide the critical elements of technology required to advance technology and meet performance goals specified for Demo III has been charted, initial steps towards implementing the plan have been executed and first demonstrations of incremental advancement have been completed. The working groups have also completed detailed trade studies of required technologies. Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation: A modeling, simulation and experimentation effort conducted by the MMBL, with assistance from ARL, has been running in parallel with the technology development program. The program has the twin goals of utilizing simulations to estimate the operational effectiveness of differing technological solutions and hardware/software configurations and developing TTPs required to employ this technology effectively. An important outcome of thisUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2a, RDT&E Project Justification Date: February 1999 effort will be the technical support package (TSP) that will be required to support the second generation Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) user appraisal currently scheduled for FY 2002. The second of four constructive simulations and the first virtual simulation investigating alternative chassis configurations with differing size, weight, and mobility characteristics, together with a series of reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) mission packages of varying capability using Modular Semi-Automated Forces ( ModSAF) simulations at the MMBL has been completed. Here, the Demo III XUVs were employed together with manned systems to form notional battalion and brigade scout forces engaged in both offensive and defensive operations as part of a mechanized combined arms force. Measures of effectiveness, such as loss exchange ratio were obtained for a limited number of experiments employing accepted, standard operational scenarios. The technology integration effort represents the third thrust of the Demo III effort. This final component of the program will integrate technology on-board a testbed vehicle and demonstrate autonomous mobility required to conduct the military scout mission under tactical conditions. Unlike the other program elements, this program element was designed to be conducted by an industrial contractor chosen through a competitive procurement process that is being managed by the U.S. Army Tank -automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC). In January 1998, TARDEC awarded a contract to a contractor team lead by Robotic Systems Technology (RST), teaming with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Center for Intelligent Systems (CIS) and Sarnoff Corporation. A Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was conducted in late July by the technology integration contractor team who presented their initial design and integration plans - the result of an extensive series of trade studies and analyses conducted over the past five months - for review, analysis and constructive criticism by the government participants, and for further refinement prior to the Critical Design Review (CDR).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) Brief description of element: CALS is an international core strategy to share integrated digital product data through a set of standards to achieve efficiencies in business and operational mission areas. DoD's overarching goal in CALS is to develop a seamless defense enterprise in which the knowledge products of the acquisition process are immediately and rapidly accessible to all authorized users while maintaining near immediate currency and quality of information. This desired state is referred to as the \"Integrated Data Environment (IDE)\". The IDE (immediate access to quality information) drives many defense-wide and functional-specific reforms and business process improvements. The rapid sharing of information is an implied requisite of Integrated Product and Process Teams, a fundamental process for implementing concurrent engineering and streamlining project management. Digitized information frees logistics support and operator personnel from the burden of cumbersome document or file formats for information processing or presentation - enabling new methods for the performance of maintenance and training tasks based on interactive electronic technologies. This program element is to (1) assess and transition evolving automation technologies into the CALS strategy; (2) develop, maintain and apply to weapon system program office operations an executable business model for the application of CALS and related technologies; (3) integrate technical and functional requirements into a Shared Information Framework of the standards, protocols, procedures, and network management conventions required to achieve compatible implementation of the IDE throughout the international defense enterprise. (U) Program Accomplishments and Plans: (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments : Supported Joint Service initiatives for Business Process Improvements (BPI) using CALS technology. Areas of focus were on identifying opportunities for and implementing BPI concepts to establish the Integrated Data Environment ($1.000 Million) Supported a Weapon System Program's development of an IDE ($1.147 Million) Continued development and update of analytic tools and methods to support the IDE implementations ($.025 Million) Completed Integrated Weapon System Database (IWSDB) technology ($4.000 Million) (U) FY 1999 Plans: Complete Tri-Service IETM architecture ($4.125 Million) Reengineer logistics processes based on CALS technologies ($1.000 Million) Assess integration of CALS technologies with dynamic product models ($.368 Million) Complete development of CALS-based Navy \" Telogistics\" prototype ($.120 Million) Complete integration of prognostics and IETM architecture ($2.152 Million)UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Justification February 1999 (U) FY 2000 Plans: Continue to reengineer logistics processes based on CALS technologies ($.895 Million) Employ CALS in developing architectures to govern the modernization of integrated supply chain information systems ($.757 Million) (U) FY 2001 Plans: Continue to reengineer logistics processes based on CALS technologies ($.925 Million) Continue to employ CALS in developing architectures to govern the modernization of integrated supply chain information systems ($.698 Million) (U) B.

Today, national defense planners and strategists have to operate with the knowledge that future adversaries will have access to satellite derived intelligence, warning, communications, navigation, weather and other information that can significantly enhance their war-fighting capability and increase the risk to U.S. and allied forcesUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) FEB 99 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Anti-Satellite Program Development - PE 0603892D (U) In 1989 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop a ground-launched, kinetic energy (i.e., hit-to-kill) anti-satellite (KE ASAT) weapon system which would leverage off technologies developed by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command in support of the (then) Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Following a Milestone I Defense Acquisition Board Review in December of 1989, the Army was given responsibility for development of the weapon elements of the system (booster, kill vehicle, launch and ground support systems, and the mission and battery control centers.) The Air Force was given responsibility for development of the command and control elements that would have allowed the Commander-in- Chief, U.S. Space Command (USCINCSPACE) to plan and control ASAT engagements. (U) With the end of the cold war the perceived need for this capability, as well as support for continued funding diminished steadily and the program was restructured several times. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 (FY 1994) directed that the program be converted to a Tactical ASAT Technology Program as opposed to an acquisition program with a low funding level. Under this current program, the KE ASAT was test fired in September 1994, successfully meeting all requirements. This 94-pound kill vehicle is the critical component of a KE ASAT. The following was accomplished in FY 1998: KE Hover Test Completed at National Hover Test Facility, Edwards Air Force Base Weapon Control Subsystem (WCS) Demonstrator Software Upgraded and W5 Test Completed Graphical Display System (GDS) Added to WCS Screens KV Divert and Attitude Control System (DACS) Design Upgraded and Components Fabricated KV Flight Software Developed and Testing Initiated on Software Testbed KV Avionics Components Fabricated KV Digital Flyout Simulation Completed Seeker and GN&C Processors Upgraded UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) FEB 99 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity NOMENCLATURE Program Development - PE 0603892D FY98/99 Plans INTERCEPTOR COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION AND TESTING $6,750K INTEGRATED COMMAND AND CONTROL SUBSYSTEM $5,500K KV SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND TESTING $6,750K KILL MECHANISM TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT $8,250K HWIL FACILITY PREPARATION AND TESTING $4,000K PROGRAM MANAGEMENT $2,250K TECHNICAL SIMULATION & SUPPORT (SBIR) $4,000KUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: 99 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Anti-Satellite Program Development - PE 0603892D (U) FY 1998 Plans : The Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized $37.5 million for KE ASAT in the FY 1998 Authorization Bill.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS : (U) This Humanitarian Demining R&D program element focuses on the testing, demonstration and validation of equipment suitable for immediate use in various international humanitarian demining missions and environments. The goal is to provide the equipment to the international demining community so that they may assess the equipment's capabilities in actual demining conditions. This program focuses on R&D technology development that reduces the time and cost associated with demining while improving the overall safety of the operator. This is accomplished through the adaptation of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, the integration of mature technologies and the leveraging from past and current R&D project activity in U.S. and foreign countermine, as well as civilian unexploded ordnance clearance mission areas. The primary objectives this program aims to achieve in technological development are to improve existing mine detection technologies, overcome the heavy vegetation problems in specific environments and provide improved protection for deminers. These areas of emphasis have been adopted as a direct result of the feedback received at the Humanitarian Demining Workshop held January 20-22, 1998 and the Washington Conference on Global Demining held May 20-22, 1998. A corollary benefit form this program is that many of the technologies pursued have very high potential for satisfying requirements in other DoD mission areas, such as military area clearance. Additional technologies identified in these workshops will also be addressed. These include technologies that: detect individual mines/minefields; detect explosives in buried mines ( biosensors); confirm the presence of mines (verification); mark and map mines/minefields; improve current wide area survey equipment; clear large areas faster and more efficiently with improved mechanical clearance equipment; improve post clearance QA equipment; train deminers in mine awareness, and improve deminer hand tools.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 Title: P920t Humanitarian Demining (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY1999 Plans: (U) This program aims to initiate and/or continue development and demonstration of demining technologies while maintaining focus on the three primary areas of emphasis that include: improving current mine detection technologies, overcoming heavy vegetation problems in specific environments and providing improved protection for deminers. These primary areas of focus were defined by the various non-governmental organizations ( NGOs) present at the Humanitian Demining Workshop held in January 1998 and the various donor governments, international organizations and NGOs that participated in the May 1998 Washington Conference on Global Demining. This program will also continue development of: large mechanical clearing devices for agricultural areas and QA operations ; new alternatives for in-situ neutralization devices that are simple to use, affordable and expendable; simple, safe, robust and affordable technologies for detecting, discriminating and identifying landmines; and mine/minefield marking and mapping systems. A new area of development will be in improved large area survey equipment used for demining mission planning. Finally, the program will continue to concentrate on operational fielding of mature technologies suitable for demining.($ 18.498 Million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, FY2000 Plans: (U) Complete development and demonstrations on the improvements of existing mine detection technologies to include detection to a depth of 27cm and a publication containing a \"Consumer Report\" type approach for outlining the results of the R&D findings on currently available and near term detection technologies.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program element funds management and execution of international cooperative programs designed to maximize DoD's capability to engage in coalition warfare. Global geopolitical milieu mandates coalition operations to confront conventional and asymmetrical threats. Coalitions are preferred way to address international crises of the 21st century; coalitions lend political legitimacy to an effort and provide a broad base of support; and coalitions provide resources that mitigate the need for the U.S. to shoulder the total financial and military force burden. Furthermore, coalition doctrine, tactics and procedures must accommodate Joint Vision 2010 (JV 2010) technologies relating to information dominance, precision strike,C3I interoperability and focused logistics. The scope of the cooperative program includes the full spectrum of coalition operations, ranging from peace keeping, through tension and crisis to theater war. This program funding will leverage DoD's investment strategy to ensure DoD programs and JV2010 technologies operate in the coalition environment.

This PE was established by FY 1998 PBD 202, in response to OSD and Service agreement at the April 1997 Joint Robotics Program General Officer Steering Committee (GOSC) to have OSD retain consolidation of DoD robotics programs on unmanned ground systems through EMD. Individual Services are responsible for requirements generation and procurement funding. The JRP demonstration/validation efforts have demonstrated maturity of robotics technologies for their application to the formal acquisition process of land systems and subsystems. Emphasis is on the development of robotics technologies that: are amenable to multi-service applications; provide capability in high hazard environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability; reduce or enhance force manpower and support; and are affordable. Success has been achieved in three programs to justify EMD at this time. This PE establishes the consolidated DoD robotics program for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) which advances the UGV concepts into EMD acquisition projects for (1) the Standardized Robotic System (SRS) - a generic, modular set of kits that can be used to retrofit several different types of currently fielded vehicles to allow remote teleoperation capabilities, like obstacle breaching operations (minefields, earthworks, bunkers, etc,), that have supported Operations Joint Endeavor and Joint Guard in Bosnia; and (2) the Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) - a light version, RCSS-L will be developed for limited anti-personnel (AP) landmine/scattermine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) proofing for the light, rapid deployment forces, while a medium version, RCSS-M will be designed for AP landmine/scattermine, UXO and wire obstacle clearing, and bucket and fork capabilities to support operations by heavy force divisions and corps engineers in all terrain conditions; and (3) the Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) - a joint Army/USMC effort to develop a robotic UGV for the Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) mission; and (4) the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System, Interior (MDARS- I) - is intended to support the physical security of fixed installations, protection of critical inventory items, and tracking movement of items in warehouses.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 1999 (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments TACTICAL UNMANNED VEHICLE (TUV) No EMD Funding during this fiscal year (U) FY 1999 Plans TACTICAL UNMANNED VEHICLE (TUV) No EMD Funding during this fiscal year (U) FY 2000 Plans TACTICAL UNMANNED VEHICLE (TUV) No EMD Funding during this fiscal year (U) FY 2001 Plans TACTICAL UNMANNED VEHICLE (TUV) (2.042 million) TUV EMD effort for the design, manufacture and delivery of engineering prototypes Engineering and program management support for the TUV development B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low-Volume Terminal (LVT) is a U.S. joint and international (U.S., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) cooperative program to develop and produce the next generation LINK 16 system. Designed for tactical com bat applications and env ironments, MIDS will provide a highly jam-resistant, secure, digital (voice and data) information distri bution system, enabling rapid integrated communications, navi gation, and identification among tactical and command and control warfare elements. Affordability is being achieved through the implementation of open and commercial architecture standards and parts which will allow the tailoring of production configurations to the minimum needs of different U.S. platforms and missions. MIDS-LVT will be interoperable with the earlier generations of LINK 16 equipment, JTIDS Class 1 and 2. This Program Element will fund the U.S. cost share of development, fabrication and test of EMD terminals, and terminal level pre-operational support for U.S. platforms which are implementing MIDS. This element also funds preparations for competitive production. This element does not include the qualification and procurement of a MIDS variant for the F-15 which is called Fighter Data Link (FDL); the FDL is funded as an F-15 program element.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : The purpose of the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI) is to reduce weapon system life cycle costs, especially operating and support (O&S) costs, by inserting commercial products and processes into military systems. COSSI is a crucial element in DoD's strategy to reduce the operations and support (O&S) costs of fielded equipment. As legacy systems age, O&S costs increase, and COSSI is an effective way to lower these costs. Reducing O&S costs can make more funds available for procurement. In addition, COSSI allows DoD to capitalize on the commercial innovation cycle so equipment can be modernized faster. Adapting commercial technologies for use in military equipment often requires non-recurring engineering, testing and qualification. COSSI shares the costs of these efforts between the contractor and the Government. If the testing is successful and the cost savings validated, the items are purchased as retrofits. All COSSI projects must have an endorsement by a military customer and be linked to an existing military system. The benefits include: improved mean time between failure, improved logistics support by reducing parts obsolescence, reduced software reprogramming time and costs, improved performance, and the promotion of open system designs making future upgrades easier and less costly. COSSI uses Other Transactions rather than FAR procurement contracts so companies that do not normally do business with DOD are given the opportunity to provide cost saving ideas that would otherwise go unnoticed. OSD funding incentivizes the Services to structure joint projects with pervasive impact across weapon systems, and to institutionalize the use of Other Transaction Agreements. This program was previously been managed by DARPA. In FY1999, funding and management responsibility were transferred to the Services and OSD.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE COMMERCIAL O & AND PLANS : (U) FY 1998 Accomplishments: In FY 1998, COSSI was managed and funded by DARPA (PE 603805E).

A solicitation was issued for COSSI proposals in December, 1998. Twenty-eight proposals were received and approximately ten more are expected. Many of the proposals involve the use of commercial computers, electronics, and interfaces to reduce O&S costs on legacy aircraft, system redesigns for improved fuel efficiency and improved test equipment. The proposed projects have the potential to substantially reduce O&S costs. The proposals are being evaluated by the Services and the best ones will be provided funding. (U) FY 2000 Plans : DoD will again issue a joint solicitation for the FY2000 program. Lessons learned during previous rounds of COSSI will be used to further refine the program. DoD will use the OSD line to incentivize joint projects. Based on previous experience, most cost saving projects are expected to pertain to upgrading electronics and computers on legacy aircraft. (U) FY 2001 Plans: DoD will issue a joint solicitation for the FY2001 program. Lessons learned during previous rounds of COSSI will be used to further refine the program. DoD will use the OSD line to incentivize joint projects.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE COMMERCIAL O & S SAVINGS INITIATIVE PE 0604805D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) B.

A6.(U) JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENT FOR THE PROGRAM ELEMENT: (U) The program element is correctly classified in Budget Activity 6 because it provides operational technical support for the Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Technology by identifying and assessing militarily critical technologies DOD assesses as critical to maintaining superior US military capabilities. Some technologies may require protection under one of the multinational control regimes. Other technologies may be eligible for use in multinational technology programs. A7. (U) ACQUISITION STRATEGY: (U) The completion of the task detailed in this program element requires technical analyses across a broad spectrum of technologies which are deemed critical to continuing US military superiority. These analyses provide the basis for: the Militarily Critical Technologies List (required by the Export Administration Act); economic and national security assessments of controls in specified technology areas; foreign technology assessments to support economic and national security policy decisions; development of export control proposals for negotiations at the Wassenaar Arrangement and multinationalUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET February ACTIVITY RDT&E, PE 0605110D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDcontrol regimes and the identification of international cooperation opportunities. The USD(A&T) provides the technical management and oversight but does not have the broad technical expertise required to accomplish these tasks. This breadth of technical knowledge can only be obtained from Government, industry and the academic community. A7. (U) ACQUISITION STRATEGY: (Continued) (U) These tasks are best performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). An FFRDC can produce independent and objective analyses of multinational programs which require access to the proprietary technical data of US and foreign defense industries, the existence and nature of which must be kept secret from potential competitors. The required access to sensitive US Government policies, and decision-making procedures concerning multinational defense critical technology programs, and the close collaboration with Government agencies required to perform these tasks, would give a contractor the marketing intelligence necessary to position itself unfairly in future multinational technology markets.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE February ACTIVITY RDT&E, funds transferred to PE0605110T for FY1999 and then to PE0605110BR for FY2000 and beyond.

The program will support critical industrial analysis to support acquisition and investment decision-making. The program objective is to ensure the Department will have access to a competitive and innovative industry capable of meeting Defense requirements when needed. Results and analytical findings will support the development and improvement of Defense policies, practices, and resource allocations to ensure availability of adequate, competitive industrial capabilities. The research agenda will initially address concerns of prime and subtier competitiveness from the system to the commodity levels. Research projects address sector consolidation, capacity issues, prime and subtier contractor capabilities, government-owned industrial and technological facilities, and system/component availability. Projects will examine supplier relationships in and between the traditional domestic Defense industry, commercial industry, and the global marketplace. Projects will identify potential competitive and capability retention issues to improve the Department's insight of sector, supplier, and system/component areas for key defense product and technology requirements. Industrial capability benchmarks, analysis tools, and educational modules are developed to improve DoD managers' understanding of acquisition decision impacts on industrial resource availability and competitiveness.

Counterproliferation Support Program funds are used to leverage DoD acquisition programs to meet the counterproliferation priorities of the Commanders-in-Chief (CINCs) of the Combatant Commands and accelerate the deployment of enhanced capabilities to the field. Specifically, the goal of the Counterproliferation Support Program is to improve specific military counterproliferation capabilities by (1) building on ongoing programs in the Services, DoD agencies, Department of Energy and U.S. Intelligence; (2) focusing on the most critical counterproliferation shortfalls to address major gaps in deployed capabilities (as reflected in the CINCs' priorities and the Counterproliferation Review Committee's (CPRC) prioritized list of counterproliferation Areas for Capability Enhancements); (3) leveraging existing program funding to more rapidly field capabilities by accelerating the deliverables of DoD programs; (4) identifying and enhancing the development of high payoff technologies to accelerate capabilities to the warfighter; (5) identifying and promoting key non-materiel initiatives that complement technological advances; and (6) transitioning Counterproliferation Support Program projects to the Services as soon as practicable. The FY 1998 Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) directed the establishment of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) effective 1 October 1998. The DTRA will be formed through the consolidation of three existing agencies: the Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA), the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA), and the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA). In addition, several functions from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) currently involved in the management of associated programs will transfer to DTRA as well. The DTRA will also carry out programs to counter proliferation and reduce threats posed by weapons of mass destruction and provide nuclear weapon stockpile and related support. As part of this budget submission, Counterproliferation Support Program funding and manpower resources programmed for FY 1999 and out are transferred to the DTRA. A five-percent military and civilian personnel savings associated with the DTRA consolidation has already been applied and is reflected in the funding and personnel transfers to DTRA.February 1999 6 - Management Support 0605160D8Z Counterproliferation Management SupportDATE BUDGET ACTIVITY PE NUMBER AND TITLEUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 PROJECT P542 Project P542 Exhibit R-2 (PE 0605160D8Z) CP Architecture Studies and Mgt/ Oversight 5042 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5042 A.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Project P545 - Nuclear Matters : In accordance with the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the Nuclear Matters (NM) office is in the process of being realigned. Budget justification and missions descriptions reflect the transition of the NM office to the new staff structure. Nuclear weapons receive special consideration within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) because of their political and military importance, destructive power and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act. Consequently, nuclear weapons issues must receive senior level attention, action and support. NM provides technical policy guidance to senior OSD leadership on complex and demanding issues pertaining to nuclear stockpile sustainment. The office works closely with OSD Policy, the Department of Energy (DOE), Congress, and foreign governments to provide policy guidance for - and oversight of - a wide variety of nuclear weapons activities. In support of these activities, Project 545 provides for analysis and assessments of issues associated with the reliability, safety, security, transportation, command and control, maintenance, storage and sustainability of the enduring stockpile. Acquisition Strategy : FY 1998 Accomplishments: 495 Recurring Obligations and Requirements Development: Produced analyses in preparation of the annual Nuclear Weapons Deployment Request to the President and support activities for senior level groups such as the Joint Advisory Committee on Nuclear Weapons Surety. Conducted analyses and assessments which provided guidance for preparation of the annual Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum, Long Range Planning Assessment to the President, the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) Chairman's Annual Report to Congress, and NWC Standing and Safety Committee actions. Products provided basis for technical policy recommendations to the President, Secretary of Defense, and NWC Chairman. 400 Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) Support: Provided support to the NWC staff and members via products on technical issues concerning the evolution of the nuclear weapons complex and infrastructure.

The solicitations are the means, prescribed by statute, through which DoD describes its research needs and solicits research proposals from small technology companies. This budget item also funded the monitoring of DoD-wide SBIR program expenditures, as required by law, as well as DoD's annual reporting to Congress and the Small Business Administration on the operation of DoD's SBIR program. And this budget item funded two national SBIR conferences each attracting 800-1000 companies, in which the companies met directly with DoD scientists, contracting officers, and program managers, and learned how to prepare SBIR proposals and design research projects that will serve the DoD mission. In addition, this budget item funded USD(A&T) initiatives to streamline the SBIR process and facilitate participation in the program by companies not used to doing business with the government. Such initiatives included the creation and distribution of an SBIR desk reference for DoD contracting officers and technical personnel, the operation of an SBIR Help Desk (800/382-4634) for program participants, the operation of an SBIR Home Page, and other projects. Lastly, it funded the first stage of a USD(A&T)-directed evaluation of DoD's new SBIR \"Fast Track\" policy, under which small businesses that attract matching funds from outside investors receive a significantly higher probability of SBIR award. ($1.609 Million) FY 1999 Plans : This budget item continues to fund the core administrative functions discussed above - coordination, publication, and distribution of the solicitations; monitoring and reporting on the DoD-wide operation of the program; and sponsorship of the national SBIR conferences. It also continues to fund the USD(A&T) initiatives to streamline the SBIR process (SBIR Desk Reference, SBIR Help Desk, SBIR Home Page). It will also fund the second stage of the Fast Track evaluation (see FY 1998 discussion). Finally, it will fund a new initiative launched by the USD(A&T) in February 1998 to: (1) develop and implement quantifiable, performance-based metrics of the SBIR program's effectiveness in spawning viable new productsUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDsold to DoD and others; and (2) systematically monitor the track record of multiple award winners in developing successful new products, and to use that track record in the SBIR proposal evaluation process. This program element includes funding for travel, including invitational travel, in support of the above activities.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element : The non-lethal tactical UAV systems for DoD provide warfighters with a dedicated capability for day/night aerial reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA); intelligence; communications/data relay; electronic warfare; weather data collection to support combat operations; minefield detection; and nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance in limited adverse weather. Tactical UAVs provide ground and naval commanders with near-real-time reconnaissance capability for sustained, deep RSTA support, and combat assessment (CA). UAV support to the maneuver battalions and brigades incorporates downsized, portable equipment that is capable of rapid deployment, easy to operate and maintain with minimum manpower and training requirements, and capable of launch and recovery in a constrained operating environment. The shipboard capability supports the Naval Task Forces. UAVs are intended for deployment in environments where immediate feedback is necessary and manned aircraft are unavailable or excessive risk makes the use of manned aircraft undesirable. Current Hunter UAV assets support training and UAV commonality and interoperability efforts. Scaleability requirements are captured in the Tactical Control System (TCS) to meet users' operational needs at multiple echelons. The Outrider Tactical UAV (TUAV) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) provided a single UAV that moves towards meeting Joint Services tactical UAV requirements. The TUAV endurance objective is to provide four hours flying time on station at a distance of up to 200 kilometers. The baseline UNCLASSIFIED Exhibit R-2, RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, DEFENSE-WIDE/BUDGET ACTIVITY 7R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE RSTA capabilities. The basic ACTD includes risk mitigation efforts of a UAV Common Automatic Recovery System (UCARS). The Outrider ACTD program demonstrated Joint Services (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) tactical UAV requirements culminating in each Service's Military Utility Assessment. Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) addresses the ground based and shipboard operations of tactical UAVs. In addition, efforts are underway to develop a common TCS to provide an interoperable capability for control of the spectrum of present and future tactical UAV air vehicles and payloads utilized by the military services for RSTA and CA. TCS will interface with the High Altitude Endurance (HAE) UAV systems and multiple C4I systems. TCS is structured to develop concepts of operation in conjunction with warfighters, to transform the operational concepts into a technical architecture with technical performance parameters, to demonstrate key capabilities through a rapid prototyping and demonstration effort, and to conduct supporting analyses, simulations, and trade studies leading to production in FY99. The Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) is an integral part of the TCS development. The SIL allows the integration and simulation of air vehicles, payloads, and system upgrades prior to actual flight. Integration of software and hardware within this controlled laboratory environment reduces the cost of test and evaluation and the risks associated with actual flight test. The Common Systems Development (CSD) provides for system interoperability and commonality among UAVs. Efforts such as open architecture, payload development, joint logistics, and simulation and modeling continue to ensure reduced life cycle costs, improved supportability, and the exploitation of technological advancement having UAV application. This program is categorized as Budget Activity 7 because it provides for development of technologies and capabilities in support of operational system development.

A.Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element : The Tactical Control System (TCS) provides interoperability and commonality for mission planning, command, control, communications, and data dissemination for the current and future family of tactical and Medium Altitude Endurance (MAE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It provides a full range of scaleable UAV capability from passive receipt of air vehicle and payload data to full air vehicle command and control. TCS functionality supports the joint warfighter with a common core operation environment to receive, process, and disseminate UAV air vehicle and payload data from two or more different UAV types for reconnaissance, surveillance, and combat assessment. TCS also has an objective capability to receive and disseminate payload information from the Global Hawk and DarkStar endurance UAVs. TCS supports seamless integration into the existing C4I architecture and interfaces with other manned and unmanned reconnaissance platforms and intelligence systems providing information superiority through cross cueing. TCS maximizes the use of Commercial and Government off-the-shelf (COTs and GOTs) hardware and software whenever possible. TCS software will be interoperable and operate on existing service computer platforms and compliant with the ASD(C3I) Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), Common Imagery Ground/Surface Station (CIGSS), and the United States Imagery Standards, and Defense Information Infrastructure/Common Operating Environment (DII-COE). The UAV Joint Technology Center and Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) supports the assessment of system integration readiness prior to actual flight testing. The JTC/SIL provides for hardware-in-the-loop tests of payloads, air vehicles (A/V), ground system components, and joint interoperable interface and UAV Concept of Operations (CONOPS) evaluations using the Multiple UAV Simulation Environment (MUSE) in Advanced Warfighting Exercises (AWEs).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element : The High Altitude Endurance (HAE) UAV Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program consists of two types of air vehicles, the Conventional HAE (CONV HAE) - Global Hawk and a Low Observable HAE (LO HAE) - DarkStar, and a Common Ground Segment (CGS), common and interoperable with both types of air vehicles. The Global Hawk and the HAE UAV Common Ground Segment projects are documented separately. The objective of this program is to place the assets in the hands of the warfighter as quickly as possible to assess the utility of the system via military exercises with other service/theater systems. The execution of the DarkStar project is dependent on funding of the HAE UAV Common Ground Segment project which contains the ground segment RDT&E and government developmental and demonstration support funding for both DarkStar and Global Hawk A/Vs. The DarkStar will provide continuous, all-weather, day/night, wide area reconnaissance and surveillance in direct support of the Joint Forces Commander. The system consists of aircraft, sensors, communications and interfaces to theater systems to support tactical warfighters at various levels of command. The DarkStar will integrate with the existing tactical airborne reconnaissance architectures for mission planning, data processing, exploitation, and dissemination. The DarkStar will provide wide area search, over 15,000 sq nm per mission, with either the Electro Optical (EO) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors at 1m resolution. In addition, the DarkStar is capable of 600 spot images per mission with either sensor at 0.3m resolution. The search and spot modes can be interleaved with attendant reductions in the overall coverage. The system will support a targeting accuracy of at least 20m CEP. The stealth capabilities of the DarkStar allow the system to operate in high threat environments beforeUNCLASSIFIED Exhibit R-2, RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, DEFENSE-WIDE/BUDGET ACTIVITY 7R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (EUAV) PE 0305205D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDsuppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) where manned reconnaissance and the Global Hawk are not viable options.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element : The objective of the CDL effort within the DARP is to define an interoperable command, control and communications capability for intelligence and reconnaissance assets to include both manned and unmanned platforms. CDL will achieve interoperable communications paths by employing an architecture based on developed hardware, software, and waveforms to promote commonality among the Services. The CDL program will maintain design configuration commonality resulting in lower life-cycle costs. The CDL design will permit existing and future reconnaissance assets to operate worldwide, providing sensor data directly to ground sites or via satellite or air-to-air relay when the asset and ground site are not within line-of-sight. This effort will integrate commercial satellite communications into the available satellite relay options to ensure sufficient wideband data relay capability. The system will have sufficient bandwidth to accommodate numerous sensors collecting SIGINT, IMINT and Multi-spectral data. Modular design allows for future technology insertion. The commonality of modular components reduces non-recurring engineering and life cycle costs to the DoD user. Interoperability provides for the exchange of data across service or agency boundaries.

Acquisition Strategy : The Advanced Sensors line funds virtually all airborne advanced sensor developments necessary to collect against an increasingly sophisticated and rapidly evolving collection threat. It consists of one large SIGINT program (JASA) and several smaller programs - SIGINT, IMINT, & MASINT. The DoD placed increased emphasis in making the numerous SIGINT systems flying on Service platforms more interoperable and common. A Joint SIGINT Avionics Family is being developed to achieve this goal. In the interim, collection capability must be sustained in existing manned reconnaissance aircraft until more enhanced, capable JASA systems become available. This line also funds IMINT and MASINT developments and upgrades such as the MSI H/SIP and SYERS upgrades and the imagery sensor development to be flown on the Predator UAV. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Brief Description of Element : There are two primary objectives for the Advanced Technology funding: (1) to evaluate the utility and maturity of technology for airborne reconnaissance applications; and (2) to reduce the risk of employing emerging technologies in system upgrades, new system acquisitions, or Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations ( ACTDs), by integrating and exercising them in developmental and operational tests. Once technologies are matured under this project, they often feed into Advanced Sensor projects for further development prior to being transitioned to the Services for procurement. These technologies help satisfy the requirements of the objective architecture set forth in the Integrated Airborne Reconnaissance Strategy (IARS). These technology investments are also identified in the Airborne Reconnaissance Technology Program Plan (ARTPP), published in November 1994. They were carefully selected from a broad range of technologies to provide utility to the warfighter at acceptable levels of cost and risk. This project continues technology transition programs in the critical areas identified in the ARTPP. Included are: exigent target detection; advanced exploitation, geolocation; communications, advanced digital reconnaissance, and advanced signals intelligence (SIGINT). This is not a prioritized listing. A new category, technology initiatives, includes technology transition programs including those designated by Congress. This program is categorized as Budget Activity 7 because it provides for the development of technologies and capabilities in support of operational system development.

The CIGSS objective is to enable all systems to receive, process, exploit, and report any imagery source regardless of platform or sensor type to meet the intelligence and targeting needs of tactical commanders. The CIGSS project provides the warfighter with an integrated and interoperable airborne reconnaissance imagery processing and exploitation capability that can be tailored for all levels of conflict. CIGSS consolidates the JROC and DARSC approved restructure of the Joint Service Imagery Processing System (JSIPS) program including JSIPS-Navy, JSIPS-Air Force, JSIPS-Marine Corps, Enhanced Tactical Radar Correlator (ETRAC), Modernized Imagery Exploitation System (MIES), PACAF Interim National Exploitation System (PINES), and Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG) into a single project. The Navy CIGSS component, JSIPS-N, includes three major components, the Digital Imagery Workstation Suite Afloat (DIWSA), the National Input Segment (NIS), and a subset of equipment from the Tactical Input Segment (TIS). DIWSA receives, exploits, and disseminates imagery products based on multi-source imagery. The NIS and TIS provide the capability to receive, record, and process imagery from multiple sources. The Air Force CIGSS component consists of two deployable JSIPS systems, a deployable commercial imagery ground system (Eagle Vision), and the fixed PINES system. The Army CIGSS components consists of the MIES, ETRAC and the imagery portion of the Tactical Exploitation System (TES) systems. MIES receives and exploits imagery from national and theater sources and provides intelligence reports and exploited imagery products to the field commander. ETRAC is a C-130 drive on/off capable system that receives Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data inputs from various platforms, converts the SAR data to exploitable images, and is capable of stand-alone operations. ETRAC and MIES are combined in the TES to be fielded beginning in FY 1999. The Marine Corps component of CIGSS consists of a JSIPS system identical to the UNCLASSIFIED Exhibit R-2, BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION DATE February 1999 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, DEFENSE-WIDE/BUDGET ACTIVITY 7R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE 0305208D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDAir Force JSIPS and three JSIPS variants referred to as the Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG). It will be a small, highly mobile system that will provide the Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) with the capability of processing and exploiting SAR and Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) imagery from theater and tactical reconnaissance aircraft. A mobile CIGSS testbed was developed to support the integration and test of CIGSS components and validation of interfaces prior to the introduction of CIGSS into the operational environment. The testbed will also be used by Program Offices to test interfaces with new sensors, applications, and other modifications. This program is categorized as Budget Activity 7 because it provides for development of technologies and capabilities in support of Operational System Development.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a major initiative introduced by NATO at the January 1994 Brussels Summit. The Partnership is working to expand and intensify political and military cooperation throughout Europe, increase stability, diminish threats to peace, and build strengthened relationships by promoting the spirit of practical cooperation and commitment to democratic principles that underpin the Alliance. Partnership for Peace Information Management System (PIMS) is a DOD leadership project that will enhance cooperation and coordination bilaterally and multilaterally in accordance with US policy and to US benefit. Firmly based on priority requirements, PIMS is part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 and one of only two specifically highlighted activities. PIMS implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructures. R&D funding is critical to provide tailored database development support to US and NATO-approved PfP Cooperative Areas such as Peacekeeping, Civil-Military Emergency Planning, and Exercises. It is also necessary to provide the requisite technical support to establish an information sharing capability to achieve the JCS Chairman's interoperability and integration goals outlined in Joint Vision 2010 for working in concert with allied and coalition forces in future operations. In addition, R&D dollars are essential to the enhanced systems development required to support the recently announced SecDef three-part proposal for building an enhanced PfP education and training framework. This framework incorporates a Consortium of Defense Academies and Security Institutes; an exercise simulation network focused on peace support operations; and a cooperative network of nationally sponsored PfP training centers. The proposal envisions a lead role for PIMS to provide research, development, and specialized engineering services in support of a distributed training environment. Moreover, R&D dollars must be directed to ensuring that PIMS is compliant with the evolving Defense Information Infrastructure and follows the guidance and recommendations of the Clinger-Cohen Act. The program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because it supports currently employed systems and training activities. * Includes Congressionally-mandated funding plus-up for IT support to international educational medical programs utilized on PIMS .U N C L A S S I F I E D U N C L A S S I F I E DExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: February 1999 Program Plans - Database development in support of OSD and Joint Staff policy objectives, i.e. Peacekeeping, Emergency Planning, and Professional Military Education, tailored to PfP mission enhancement.
