For example, I talk about Christopher Reeves a lot because most people know who he was. He was a very famous actor who fell off a horse and broke his neck and drove some bone fragments into the spinal cord and limited the communication from the brain to the rest of the body. Now, everyone knows that he couldn't walk, and he couldn't breathe on his own. What a lot of people don't know is that any quad or paraplegic, after a spinal cord injury that limits nerve system function, gets put on antibiotics usually for the rest of their life. Why? Because the medical doctors know that when there is that much pressure or interference on the nerve system, it can't tell the immune system what to do. Doctors artificially pump people up with antibiotics to kind of let the pills do the job that normally the nerve system would do. If someone has a subluxation and there is irritation to the nerves, not to the same degree as Chris Reeves or a quad or paraplegic, it is still limiting the function of their nerve system and limiting the function of their immune system. We want that pathway to be clear and free from interference so the body can run, regulate, and heal itself by maximizing the function of the immune system, not limiting it to a lesser role. It's got to be at or as close to one hundred percent as possible for the immune system to work as best as it can. The better the immune system works, the better you are at fighting infection. That includes COVID or any other infection, it just doesn't matter. The major premise is always to remember that regular chiropractic care keeps the bones in good alignment, keeps pressure off the nerves, and it allows the nerve system to control all the other systems better including the immune system. And that's why it's about natural immunity and letting your body function as best that you can. There are times when the body needs some help. Christopher Reeves or any other quadriplegic might need that help because there's no adjustment that can get rid of their type of interference. However, in the average person, optimizing the nerve system will optimize the immune system and make them a stronger, healthier individual. Now, it stacks the deck in your favor but there is no guarantee. Chiropractic is not a panacea. It does not make you bulletproof, but it certainly stacks the deck in your favor. And that's what we're all looking for, especially in times like these. [Click here to receive more information & to "}
