Steiner frequently reminded the audiences at his lectures and tirelessly described for his readers how human souls were once so embedded in the creativity of the spiritual worlds that it was their physical surroundings, not their spiritual origins, which were unfamiliar to us. Now, thanks to the evolution of our souls' consciousnesses, our souls feel fully at home in the physical world but in the process we have lost our capacity to recognize the scope and nature of spirit existence. Perhaps not all human beings feel the loss yet. But humanity does have the longing and potential to turn the soul toward spirit powers that sleep in us, and toward spirit beings who await our efforts with an expectant interest. Steiner describes the evolution of human soul capacities that have evolved along with our souls' consciousness, in this age of the consciousness soul (which started in the fourteen and fifteen hundreds) and the time of the Archangel Michael's regency over humanity's spiritual culture on Earth (which started in 1879 and has three or four hundred more years to go.) Steiner has a second name for the consciousness soul. He calls it the \"spirit soul\" and he describes it as the forerunner of, and prerequisite for, what he calls the \"spirit self,\" a metamorphosis in our \"astral\" or \"soul\" bodies. Anthroposophy and its path of knowledge, \"uniting the spirit in the human being with the spirit in the universe,\" will help to create this first of three possible metamorphoses in humanity's supra-sensory bodies. We whose souls meditate along that path of knowledge will surely contribute to the evolving spirit self. As Steiner's well 2 known characterization of Anthroposophy points out, those of us who feel the loss of intimate understanding of the gods are earnestly seeking what anthroposophy brings. In the first paragraph of his characterization, Steiner speaks of Anthroposophy as a guide that already inhabits the human being. Anthroposophy arises there \"as a need of the heart, of the life of feeling and...can be justified only inasmuch as it can satisfy this inner need.\" With \"certain questions on the nature of the of the human being and the universe\"\u2014questions that humanity experiences as \"an elemental need of life, just as one feels hunger and thirst\"\u2014Anthroposophy reaches out from a human being's inner, microcosmic spirituality to the spirit in the outer, macrocosmic universe. In the second paragraph, Steiner's characterization of Anthroposophy changes its \"angle of vision\" as Emerson would say. Now Steiner's view takes in the culture, or perhaps the general thinking, of his time and ours. In the first quarter of the 20th century, and still today at the early decades of the twenty-first, the notion of a science of spirit sounds paradoxical or whimsical to some readers, who then dismiss it as wishful thinking. Steiner himself does not share that view. In this second paragraph of his characterization of Anthroposophy, he says directly that there is no reason to feel compelled to turn away from perceiving spirit realities when one comes to an apparent barrier. He draws attention to an apparent limit or borderline which, however need not be seen as a wall but can instead be perceived as a door. Anthroposophy, Steiner says, lives on both sides of this apparent boundary, or it cannot really live at all\u2014a serious, telling, and urgent summary. Here is the second paragraph of the characterization: Anthroposophy communicates knowledge that is gained in a spiritual way. Yet it only does so because everyday life, and the science founded on sensation 3 and intellectual activity, lead to a barrier along life's way\u2014a limit where the life of the soul in the human being would die if it could go no further. Everyday life and science do not lead to this limit in such a way as to compel the human being to stop short at it. For at the very frontier where the knowledge derived from sensory perception ceases, the further outlook into the spiritual world is opened through the human soul itself.i Steiner emphasizes the barrier that can seem either wall or door because he wants to concede its double presence and at the same time say clearly that the door is open to those who can perceive it be so. Fortunately, those whose souls experience the yearning, heart-felt questions that Steiner describes in the first paragraph are fully able to see the barrier of the second paragraph as a frontier, where physical becomes spiritual, or finite infinite, and a mystery with infinite proportions beckons. Steiner's characterization of Anthroposophy manages to honor the sincerity with which those who feel drawn to Anthroposophy engage it and at the same time to point out candidly that its knowledge is \"gained in a spiritual way.\" A warning? An apology? A proud announcement? One need not decide. It is obvious that Steiner's statements about the apparent barrier that can actually become a frontier have no intention to persuade or proselytize. They simply assert that Anthroposophy needs to be perceived and cognized as a spiritual knowledge. Anthroposophy's path of knowing is a path of recognizing that a frontier exists where the spirit in human beings can orient toward the task of spiritual knowing and can engage the possibility to integrate that fuller knowing with the \"I\". Those whose destiny brings them to anthroposophy in this current incarnation, Steiner suggests, can expect to encounter a new experience of both knowledge and spirit. 4 Meditation in the Soul and in the \"I\" Is the \"I\" spiritual or physical? Does it incarnate or hover? In Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path (1894) Steiner speaks of two connections between the human being and our \"I\": The physical body \"organization\" as he calls it has one relation to our \"I,\" and the consciousness soul has another. In the first relation we identify ourselves with our physical body from the time we are able to say the word \"I\" in reference to our self. But the second relation has to do with the scope and nature of our essential thinking: It is purely spirit; it actually takes place in the body when the organization of the body makes room for it.ii The resulting interaction between physical and spiritual can be found in Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path, but it is clearer, if less epistemological, in the following quotation from Steiner's Theosophy:iii Steiner explains how \"The \"I\" lives in the soul\": The \"I\" lives in the soul. Although the highest manifestation of the \"I\" belongs to the consciousness soul, it is also true that the \"I\" radiates outward from there, filling the entire soul and exerting its influence on the body through the soul. Within the \"I,\" the spirit is alive and active. The spirit streams into the 'I,\" taking it as its \"garment\" just as the \"I\" itself lives in the body and the soul. The spirit shapes the \"I\" from the inside out and the mineral world shapes it from the outside in. We will call the spirit that shapes the \"I\" and lives as \"I,\" spirit self, since it appears as the human \"I,\" the \"self.\" Having shown that the spirit self is part of the \"I\" and vice versa, Steiner goes further into the question of the self as physical, or spiritual, or both: 'The spirit self is a revelation of the spiritual world within the \"I,\" just as a sense perception, coming from the other side, is a revelation of the physical world within the \"I.\"\" We learn from 5 what follows now that the \"I\" \"opens its doors on both sides\" when it lives in the soul (my emphasis): Through intuitions, the \"I,\" awakening in our soul, receives messages from above, from the spiritual world, just as it receives messages from the physical world through sensations. In this way, the \"I\" makes the spiritual world part of its personal soul life, just as it does with the physical world by means of the senses. The soul, or rather the \"I\" that is beginning to shine within it, opens its doors on two sides, toward the physical world and toward the spiritual. In other words, when we meditate, we exercise the \"I\" and, since it lives in our soul, we learn from it as well. The \"I\" can \"open its doors\" to spiritual realities and it can help receive sensations from those realities when we manage to work with our spirit soul, as distinct from our physically opened senses. In this way, the \"I\" and the spirit soul meditate as one. Anthroposophical knowing is essentially spiritual, not physical, which means it is essentially infinite in significance and in character. What is it in us that allows us to open the door into the infinite? The \"I\" is Steiner's cherished and foundational answer to this question. The spiritual-physical nature of our \"I\" was the main theme of Steiner's dissertation, \"Truth and Knowledge,\" and of his foundational book, Philosophy of Freedom(1894).iv As I briefly noted above, in that book Steiner makes the point that the human \"I\" is, at first, felt to be part of our body (Chapter 9). This feeling we have makes us at first identify our Self with our body. Still, the \"I\" in us is in fact spiritual and our bodily self can perceive that fact when we trade our ordinary thinking (as Steiner often calls it) for our living, essential thinking. In Chapter 9 of Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual 6 Path he specifies that \"The essence of thinking can be grasped only through intuition,\" which is a deep level of thinking, and that such thinking is perceiving itself as \"a self supporting, spiritual entity\" because we are observing it while we are doing it: To observe thinking is to live, during the observation, immediately within the weaving of a self-supporting spiritual entity. We could even say that whoever wants to grasp the essence of the spirit in the form in which it first presents itself to human beings can do so in the self-sustaining activity of thinking. ...Our organization [that means our body in this sentence] suspends its own activity\u2014it makes room\u2014and, in the space that has been made free, thinking appears. When essential thinking appears, the apparently physical, body-bound \"I\" lets it perceive itself as the floor of spirit realities rather than the ceiling of physical ones. That means that our \"I,\" which we ourselves identify with our body, can also be perceived by us as belonging to the infinite. Our self-consciousness, on the other hand, belongs to our body until we realize that the activity of our essential thinking is our own even though it is body-free. With that realization, we begin to perceive that the I-consciousness (where our narcissism lives) and our thinking (which is purely spiritual) can work together toward freeing the selfless self (the essential one) from the selfish one (tied to the physical). Eventually, the two kinds of \"I,\" selfish and selfless, come together in the fitting paradox, \"Selfless Selfhood\" and the \"I\" becomes the heart of Anthroposophy, an example of spirit in action. 7 Meditation as praxis and devotion Meditation is a praxis. It is the part of your life where you consciously practice the techniques that will enable you to work with your life questions\u2014doubts and certainties, pains and joys\u2014so that you can ponder, deepen, and sometimes even organize the results of those exercises and experiments, results which are your experiences and, perhaps, findings. Not that Anthroposophy locks one into egoity. Not at all: egoity, by definition, locks one into one's narcissism without needing any help. But according to the process I just described, when the human ego is understood, through Steiner's various ways of thinking about the human being's various \"bodies,\" we realize that our ego and our self, our \"I,\" our unique being, are identical to us. The prologue to the Gospel of John counts \"life\" as among the things that God's divine word (also called the Logos) made in the beginning. Life was made in that beginning force of creativity. The prologue says about that life, \"in it [the beginning creativity] was life and the life was the light of humanity.\" I wondered for years how it could be that the light in the life that was made by God was specifically the \"light of humanity.\" Then quite recently, after literally decades of living a meditative life on the path of knowledge mapped for us by Steiner, it became suddenly clear that this 'light of humanity' is the light with which humans meditate. The life-light is \"of humanity\" when human beings meditate, that is when we rise out of our bodily existence but maintain our wakened consciousness. Without the light that dwells in divinely created life, not one of us could meditate. We meditate by means of the light, and in its company we experience its word-like intelligibility, which is able to communicate cosmic knowledge of itself to each of us. 8 Focusing: the Main Praxis When, through meditation, we find the life in which the light of humanity shines, we change. We begin to use both the life and the light consciously. We begin to perceive that the cosmos itself is our environment and is the macrocosmic source of our microcosmic existence. Practicing the intimate activity of summoning our attention and keeping it focused at will develops a two-fold capacity in us, both micro- and macrocosmic. Such practice enhances our spiritual knowing, making it ever more widely immortal, more vividly infinite. The developed attention, our higher \"I,\" can focus itself; sometimes it can also open itself to receiving what may be ready for it to know. The open attention that is ready to receive is the major ingredient of all serious, knowledge-oriented meditation. But even if one never or rarely can come to such experiences, the focusing aspect is already an enormous gift that our higher, yet microcosmic selfhood can give us, and\u2014note well\u2014can contribute to life on earth. I am my attention. Where my attention is there am I. You can test the truth of this assertion by performing a little thought exercise about it. You are walking with a friend, immersed in conversation, listening intently, when suddenly your attention wanders (as we say) and though your friend continues her story and you keep walking along, your attention has turned to planning tonight's dinner, which reminds you that you still haven't found the right present for tomorrow's birthday party, which brings you to the funeral in the community, which sets you musing at the mystery that death is part of life, when\u2014who knows why\u2014your focus returns to listening. To repeat: Where my attention is, there am I. Essentially, I am my attention. 9 Being able to focus one's attention at will and to erase its object while still keeping the attention itself empty but present may not come easily, but practicing it is a worthy way to spend the daily (or otherwise rhythmical) time you give to meditating. It's worthy because you do get stronger at summoning the attention and less invested in whether you're doing it well. It is useful to imagine a big \"x\" like this one here X The bottom triangle is your focusing area. Its sides grow slowly closer to a point, until they meet and cross in one gesture. Thereafter everything is the same but different. What was working upward from the bottom and narrowing has become the upper half, which is open at the top, empty, and waiting. Of course that big X is not a symbol or an image of anything, just a schematic drawing of the summoned, awakened attention. On the path of knowledge, focusing our self and our attention is the sine qua non of anything else we might want to do meditatively\u2014dance, paint, sing, grieve, contemplate, connect with the dead, send inner strength to our living ones in danger. Without concentration none of that can happen. The Devotional Aspect of Praxis: When Steiner created his 6-month auxiliary exercise, he began with focusing the attention on an object, which he had already pointed to as the first requirement for meditating in any way. The second of the six was to summon your will by deciding to perform a completely useless activity once each day at about the same time. Just as the object of the first exercise should be of little interest to you, so that you have to provide 10 the interest yourself, so also the little daily task of the will exercise should give you no particular advantage or value. That is, it can't be watering a plant, sewing a button, cleaning a spot on the table, because any of these are tasks you would have to do anyway, not an activity that has no purpose or reward for you. Decide to tap your left foot once or maybe twice each morning around 8:15 without forgetting to do it if you happen to be driving or food-shopping at that time. (You can do it in your imagination if the other task presents a problem.) Usually you remember it at 7:30 and will suddenly recall it at 9:30 but you will have forgotten all about it at the specified 8:15. Anthroposophists love to talk and write about \"the pencil exercise,\" as I am starting to do here. Actually, I want to emphasize not how many ways you can do these exercises but how truly devotional meditating them is. Yes, devotional. Every one of Steiner's exercises\u2014the auxiliary ones to do with one's attention, will, equanimity, positivity, and openness to new experiences; or the most exalted ones like the Rose Cross symbol exercise\u2014each and all of them have a devotional aspect. Not one of them lacks that potentially offertory quality and function. If you meditate with the reverence and humility that Steiner specifies in HowTo Know Higher Worlds, then the selfless selfhood form of your \"I\" is performing them. It's the act of performing them, not their content, that makes this praxis devotional. By meditating on the path of knowledge one generates one's own seriousness and one's own lively interest in the praxis; and one finds that performing each meditation or exercise for its own sake is basic to the whole endeavor. Meditation has no goals. How could it? We meditate to put ourselves in a situation where being there is enough. To borrow from one of Steiner's verses, life becomes clearer around you, life becomes 11 harder for you, life becomes richer in you: Those are the conditions and fruits of meditating in anthroposophy. \"Many people abandon the path to occult knowledge soon after embarking upon it because they do not notice any immediate progress,\" Steiner warns. \"Courage and self-confidence are two beacons on the path to higher knowledge. No one, who cannot patiently repeat an exercise that has failed, to all appearances, countless times before, will travel far on the path.\" v The Threefold nature of both meditation and the \"I\" Anthroposophy has no handle. It is a sphere and it doesn't matter where you pick it up. That said, it is nevertheless appropriate to return to the \"I\" at the end of this Introduction to Meditation and Spiritual Perception. The mystery of the \"I\" reigns now in the time of the consciousness soul (which began in the fourteen hundreds) and in the time when the Arch-Angel Michael, the messenger of Beginning (arche) and the messenger also of time, has his regency over human culture here on Earth, while materialism and spirituality are contending more strongly than ever for what humanity will be able to experience as real and true. For those reasons, in closing this introduction, I will speak again of the \"I\"\u2014this time of its paradoxical uniqueness and universality within humanity. We have said that the \"I\" is who meditates. We should add here that the \"I\" is, for human Earthlings, the one who dies on Earth into cosmic life whence it also enters a new birth when the time comes to return to Earth, bringing the pre-birth intentions it had crafted among the spheres. Our \"I\" enacts Anthroposophy's central mission: to live as an individual who comes to birth from an earlier life and will return to that source-like 12 \"place\" or existence after so-called death, returning with new karma when ready to be born on Earth again. Each and all of us are individuals, which means that each and all of us have our own uniqueness. Everyone has it; no human is without it. In that sense, uniqueness is the one thing all human beings have in common. The word that each of us can say about ourselves, \"I,\" is the same word for each of us. But we can only use it to refer to our self\u2014not to others, not even to one single other! Such multiplicity in the very place of one-ness signals the paradoxical character of the \"I\" and of the spiritual realities that Anthroposophy brings us to on the path of knowledge. Of course, paradox is hardly unique to Anthroposophy. Every Koan depends on it, as do riddles. Avoiding paradoxical speech in ordinary science is symptomatic of that science's reductive culture, whereas anthroposophy, as a spiritual-physical science, discovers paradox at every turn. The \"I,\" then, belongs to anthroposophical discourse, and meditation on the path of knowledge often engages the \"I.\" Of the twelve senses Anthroposophy attributes to human beings in earthly life, the \"ego sense\" or \"I-sense\" is the highest, the twelfth. It is also called the \"you-sense,\" and that nomenclature opens a marvelous field of spiritual activity to explore on the path of knowledge. Is the self only selfish? To be selfless must I shed my selfhood? As we work with such questions, both as questions and as experiences that, later, can illumine the question we find that our Selfhood has a selfless quality more or less hidden in it. Selfless Selfhood is our potential when it comes to transforming what we have been given into that with which we can give. That capacity has three angles to it. The \"I\" angle of individuality described earlier, and two more\u2014freedom and knowledge. 13 Freedom characterizes our humanity as much as uniqueness does. Without freedom we believe we are dependent on circumstances\u2014poverty, illness, an inheritance from a billionaire, a great talent, an extraordinary beauty, a life of hatred, violence, and mendacity, any seemingly dominating circumstances in our life. The spiritual power to discriminate between our \"I\" and our circumstances lives in us as freedom. When we find freedom and own it, our dependency leaves us, the pain that our circumstantial troubles seemed to bring us is lifted to a large extent, and a grace lives where the problems used to be. On the other hand, individuality and freedom can clash\u2014for example, when your personal ethics are at odds with social expectations of your community. The great 19th-century satirist and novelist, Mark Twain (1835-1910) often placed his characters in positions where they have to decide whether to obey the expectations of the corrupt but socially admired leaders in their community, or find a way out without being ostracized or otherwise punished. In his Masterpiece, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Huck has stolen Jim, a slave \"belonging\" to the conventional, conservative, extremely proper white woman, Mrs. Watson, because young Huck, who is white, wanted to free Jim, who is black, from slavery. Huck also wanted to get away from his drunken father while he was at it, and, if truth be told, to get away from proper, small town life and have some adventures out in the world. Together, Huck and Jim escape, fashion a raft, and let it take them down the Mississippi River. Young Huck and kind, grateful Jim stay hidden so that they will not be caught, and at first they have an idyllic journey, eating well, sleeping under the stars, and enjoying their new friendship. Soon, however, they find themselves involved in some particularly trying adventures. Huck suddenly feels overwhelmed by the complexities of 14 hiding Jim and guilty about the lies and dissembling he has done to forestall one near mishap after another. He writes a letter to Mrs. Watson confessing all and telling her he will return her \"property,\" Jim, to her. As it turns out, though, before he has a chance to mail the letter, Huck discovers that Jim has wandered off and is currently lost. Huck agonizes about the whole situation. He fears for Jim's safety, realizes Jim may already be caught, and feels how much he will miss Jim if they don't soon reunite. At the same time, the god-fearing, church-going people at home, including Mrs. Watson, know that stealing is a sin and he does not particularly fancy the idea of going to Hell, which is, he knows, what sinners do. Finally, Huck realizes that he cannot bear to return Jim to his \"owner,\" or himself to his father. Tearing up the letter of confession, he makes his famous choice: \"All right then, I'll go to hell.\" Of course all Huck's agonizing makes Twain's readers respond with laughter and keen sympathy for Huck and Jim, as well as savoring Twain's satire at the expense of Mrs. Watson and those like her\u2014Philistines, Steiner would have called them. Mark Twain's great scene perfectly demonstrates the moral weight of true freedom. Steiner calls it \"ethical individualism,\" a high social and personal capacity of the \"I.\" Those who have attained it use their developed intuition to realize what they themselves must do in a particular situation, and then, counting on their intuition and drawing on their courage, they do it no matter what conventions would have required. The third angle belonging to the strangely shared uniqueness that we all call individuality is knowledge. Like freedom, it brings one to realization where there may have been a lack of understanding, inadequate ability to realize how much we may be worsening the problem, or other projections and forms of insufficient awareness. When, 15 as individuals, we find how our freedom works with knowledge, the grace of the \"I\" shows itself as a capacity for selfless selfhood. In any case, for all\u2014absolutely all\u2014human beings, without exception, this selfless selfhood is represented on Earth by the greatest possible sacrifice and the One Who made it: Christ Jesus. Steiner's Christology, including his wondrous lectures on the Gospels, knows Christ as the \"representative of humankind\" and knows that the three years Christ was able to live and then die in the body of Jesus of Nazareth is essential to the Mystery of Golgotha, as Steiner has named it. That mystery is representative not only of humanity's nature but of our capacities to live the physical spiritually. If we take seriously that the barrier in those two paragraphs characterizing Anthroposophy does not compel us to stop (as Steiner puts it so firmly), the fact that what may seem a wall is in fact a door, spiritually speaking, sets us on a path of knowledge which, whether it is meditative or not, is the path that can also be called Anthroposophy. Meditating is a way of living Anthroposophy; it makes the two one. Ultimately, living Anthroposophy is the main gift of meeting Anthroposophy through Rudolf Steiner. In the third of his three-lecture sequence on the question, \"What Is Anthroposophy?\" (July 1923), Steiner speaks forcefully, even irritably about making images of anthroposophy in contrast to actually living it. He calls the latter activity a meditation and he charges us to do it. I close with his strong words on the efficacy of living anthroposophy: Someone suggested today that we should describe an image of Anthroposophy, a picture. But is Anthroposophy not present as a reality? Do we really need another 16 image? What we need is to become intimate with Anthroposophy by means of our own inner sincerity. ... We must live concretely with Anthroposophy as a real Being that moves among us. ...We do not need a mere image for the eye of the soul. Our hearts need a love for the Being of Anthroposophy. This is what we need. This can be the best impulse for our age\u2014the experience of Anthroposophy in the human soul and heart. This intimate experience of Anthroposophy in the deepest recesses of the human soul and heart is the meditation that will lead us to a true encounter with Anthroposophy.\"vi This Volume: These \"classics\" fall into four categories. Numbers 1 through 6: The first six authors think in a parallel way about Anthroposophy and related approaches to spirituality. Such approaches make for substantial and welcome attention to Anthroposophy in congenial contexts. Numbers 7 and 8 These two speak about relationships to the dead, an area in which Anthroposophy's objectivity and detailed knowledge make rare and instructive reading. Numbers 9 through 12 The next four are autobiographical considerations of how the authors experience their meditative life, a topic which is highly pertinent to readers interested in Anthroposophy's contributions to that fast growing category in today's culture. Numbers 13 and 14 The last two pieces close the collection in a shared mood of trust in Anthroposophy and in the future. It is a mood that anthroposophists can experience earnestly by acknowledging that Anthroposophy itself has created a capacity for a truly considered optimism. 17 i Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts: Anthroposophy as a Path of Mystery (London: Rudolf Sgteiner Press,1998), p.13, italics mine.
