Much of \"complementary and alternative medicine\" is non-scientific, violating many well-established principles of physics and relying on anecdotal evidence of little scientific merit. In particular, no scientific basis exists for the notion of special vital forces or energy fields associated with living organisms. Medical journals should follow the lead of most scientific journals and not publish extraordinary claims without extraordinary evidence. Introduction One of the primary assumptions within \"complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\" is that living things possess a special energy field, linked to the cosmos, which I will call the bioenergetic field. \"Pure energy\" is viewed as a biophysical substance separate from and superseding matter. Electromagnetic fields are presented as examples of pure energy and are identified with the bioenergetic field. Newtonian mechanistic, reductionistic physics is reported to be refuted by modern physics. Quantum physics is called upon to back the assertion that the universe is one continuous, interconnected whole of which human consciousness is a part, thus allowing the mind to control reality. While generally applied to human therapies, much of CAM has appears to have found its way into veterinary medicine [1]. A major theorist of CAM is Martha Rogers [2-5], who has introduced what she calls The Science of Unitary Human Beings. In Rogers' words: Energy fields are postulated to constitute the fundamental unit of the living and nonliving.\" [The field is] a unifying concept and energy signifies the dynamical nature of the field. Energy fields are infinite and paradimensional; they are in continuous motion [5:30]. Following Rogers' lead, Joanne Stafantos, asserts: The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics. Bioenergetic medicine is the study of human and animal bodies as dynamic electromagnetic fields existing in an electromagnetic environment. ... Based on Einstein's theories of quantum physics, these energetic concepts are being integrated into medicine for a comprehensive approach to disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [6:227]. Another leading guru of the CAM movement is Deepak Chopra, the author of numerous best-sellers including Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old. Here is a sample of Chopra's assertions [7,8]: - \"The physical world is a creation of the observer.\" - \"The body is information and energy spanning the universe.\" - \"Thoughts and emotions create physical processes.\" - \"All of us are connected to patterns of intelligence that govern the cosmos.\" - \"Inside us is a field of non-change that creates who we really are.\" Psychiatrist Patricia Newton has argued that traditional healers \"are able to tap that other realm of negative entropy\u2014that superquantum velocity and frequency of electro-magnetic energy and bring them as conduits down to our level. It's not magic. It's not mumbo jumbo. You will see the dawn of the 21st century, the new medical quantum physics really distributing these energies and what they are doing.\" [9] This paper analyzes such claims within the framework of established physics. Substance Duality Most lay people believe that the universe is made of two kinds of stuff: - Matter, which includes the bodies of living organisms and the other material stuff of the universe. They have heard that matter is composed of particulate atoms, and associate material objects with notions of discreteness and scientific reductionism. - Energy, which is associated in the lay mind with spirit or soul. The common belief is that living things possess some special quality that makes them alive, an elan vital, or vital force, of living energy. CAM theorists often identify this bioenergetic field with physical electromagnetic fields, which still appear mysterious to many more than a century after their discovery. These energy fields are associated with notions of continuity and holism that are said to oppose the discreteness and reductionism of \"cold\" physical science. However, these beliefs do not reflect developments in either the physical or biological sciences of several centuries. Prior to twentieth century, most scientists held to the following picture: Energy and matter indeed were regarded as separate and distinct substances. On the other hand, while appearing continuous to the naked eye, matter was already understood to be composed of discrete, localized atoms. Light had been shown to be a form of electromagnetic wave, which was believed to result from the vibration of a continuous cosmic field, the aether. Electromagnetic waves were regarded as a form of pure energy. Gravity was thought to be a continuous action-at-a-distance field. In the twentieth century, these views evolved and changed to the following. Energy and matter were recognized to be the same stuff, as signified by Einstein's famous equation E = mc2.The discrete nature of matter was fully confirmed, and energy was shown to occur, like matter, in discrete lumps called quanta. In fact, this was the discovery of Max Planck that triggered the development of quantum mechanics. Despite what the CAM theorists seem to think, quantum mechanics is about discreteness, not continuity. The search for the continuous aether met with failure and the concept was discarded in the new physics or relativity and quantum theory. Indeed, no evidence has been found for any continuous medium in universe. Light is composed of particulate matter-photons. Fields are composed of discrete particles-quanta. The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic field, which is, in effect, like a field of pebbles. The electron is the quantum of the electron field. Finally, general relativity explains gravity in terms of the curvature of space rather than as a continuous force field. The Standard Model of Matter Material objects are made of atoms, which in turn are composed of nuclei and electrons. Nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons, which themselves are composed of quarks. By the 1970s, the following picture of matter (and energy) had been strongly established in what is still called the standard model, but is now a fully-developed and highly successful theory. Three generations of quarks and leptons exist, as illustrated below: u c t d s b ve v\u00b5 v e \u00b5 The top two rows are the quarks, and the bottom two rows are the leptons. Each column represents a \"generation,\" where the first generation encompasses the great bulk of familiar matter. The proton is composed of the three quark combination uud, while the neutron is the combination udd. These, along with the electron e, compose all the atoms of the chemical periodic table. The third row of particles are the neutrinos, which while not present in atoms are perhaps the most common particle in the universe. Each particle in the above table has an associated antiparticle. The Standard Model of Forces The elementary particles that make up matter are only half the story. The standard model also tells us how these particles interact with one another to make up the more complex stuff that has evolved into stars, planets, and horses. In the standard model, forces result from the exchange of particles called gauge bosons: electromagnetism -> photon strong nuclear -> weak bosons (4) gravity -> graviton (I have included gravity, although no quantum theory of gravity yet exists and it is not normally considered part of the standard model). While these \"force particles\" are described by quantum fields in the theory, no continuous medium, such as the aether, is involved. Quantum Fields Quantum fields are strictly theoretical objects, like the density field that describes average behavior of particulate matter. They do not describe a continuous medium, such as an aether, pervading space. Since every particle is the quantum of a quantum field, no fields exist independent of particles. Furthermore, quanta do not act instantaneously over space. Their effects propagate no faster than the speed of light. That is, quantum fields are not holistic and no basis in modem quantum physics exists for the claims made by CAM theorists-despite their unbridled use of the term \"quantum.\" Life and Mind All living organisms are composed of the same quarks and electrons as compose a rock or a river. They are acted on by the same forces. Physicists have been able to measure effects of the electromagnetic force to one part in a billion, but see not the slightest hint of special vital or psychic forces. No evidence has ever been found for any unique fields or radiation associated with living organisms. Life and mind can be understood as emergent properties of matter. Brain imaging and other neuroscience provide strong evidence for localized, material sources of thoughts and emotions. The Unconscious Quantum Quantum mechanics is said to provide a basis for a mind-matter connection. This notion arises from the fact that, in quantum mechanics, the act of observation interferes with what is being observed, as expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Chopra and others claim that reality is thus determined by consciousness. But mind and consciousness are not independent of matter. The brain is wired to the body, but not to other bodies. Nothing in quantum phenomena or quantum theory requires the introduction of non-material or holistic elements. Has Modem Physics Shown that Classical, Reductionist Physics is \"Wrong?\" Most physics taught in classrooms is still classical physics. Modern physics is built on a base of classical physics and is still completely materialistic and reductionistic. Modern technology, biology, and medicine still rely heavily on classical physics. The claim that a paradigm shift occurred with modern physics is debatable. In fact, the last major paradigm shift in physics occurred when Newton's physics replaced Aristotle's. As Nobel physicist Steven Weinberg has explained: Revolutions in science seem to fit Kuhn's description only to the extent that they mark a shift in understanding some aspect of nature from pre-science to modem science. The birth of Newtonian physics was a mega-paradigm shift, but nothing that has happened in our understanding of motion since-not the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics, or from classical to quantum physics-fits Kuhn's description of a paradigm shift [10]. What Constitutes Evidence? Any claim that implies the overthrow of well-established scientific principles has an extraordinary burden of proof. Since so much rubbish is out there, the only rational and practical policy is to ignore such claims until extraordinary evidence is presented. Anecdotal evidence is ordinary, since people can be easily tricked or self-deluded. The placebo effect is powerful and difficult to eliminate even in the best controlled experiments. A single experiment, even peer-reviewed, is never enough. Multiple independent replications are essential. Let me list some ordinary claims that, if true, would violate no established science: Ordinary Claims - Some herbs may have some medical benefits. - Relaxation or meditation may have some medical benefit. - Chiropractic treatments may ease back pain. - A patient's state of mind can affect his or her health. - Treating the \"whole patient\" may be better than just treating his or her parts. - High frequency electromagnetic radiation has harmful effects. On the other hand, consider the following examples of extraordinary claims that, if true, would violate well-established science: Extraordinary Claims - Homeopathic remedies can have any effect at all. - Meditation tunes you into the cosmic field of mind. - Chiropractic treatments can cure a wide range of illnesses. - Mind can overcome established physical law. - You can improve a person's health by manipulating his or her vital energies. - Acupuncture is more than a placebo effect. - Low frequency electromagnetic radiation has harmful effects. - Placing magnets on the body will have any effect at all. Publication Thresholds Based on the standards of physics, where extraordinary phenomena are often observed, the threshold for publication of extraordinary claims in medical journals should be raised considerably. Most journals in medicine, psychology, and pharmacology, as well as parapsychology, seem to allow publication at the p = 0.05 significance level, usually misrepresenting this as the \"probability for the result being due to chance.\" The precise definition of the p-value is as follows: If the null hypothesis is correct, then the reported effect or a greater one would occur as a statistical artifact on the average a fraction p times. That is, the p-value makes no statement about the likelihood that the reported effect is real. It only makes a statement about the expected frequency that the effect would result from chance when the effect is not real. Thus, according to statistical theory, when a reported effect is said to have a p-value of 0.05, then in every 20 replications of the experiment we can expect one, on average, to be a statistical artifact. Since few experiments showing null effects are published, it is easy to imagine 19 of these left in the \"filedrawer.\" For example, the significance of a highly touted study on the medical benefit of prayer was p = 0.04. One might ask how many negative experiments were not published? Perhaps 25 or more and only the one that gave an effect at this level of significance was reported. The field of physics is rife with examples of reported extraordinary effects with p-values much lower than .05 that failed to be replicated and never became a part of established knowledge. The accepted criterion in most physics journals is p = 104. That is, an effect is published when only one in 10,000 experiments or more would produce the observation as a statistical artifact. A much stricter threshold than p = 0.05 should be used for extraordinary claims in all branches of science. Ordinary claims, consistent with existing science, can be published with weaker significance, on the understanding that these reports should do more good than harm. Great harm can come from claiming a great medical breakthrough that is nothing more than a statistical fluke. Conclusions Most CAM is non-scientific. If it were scientific, it would be neither complementary or alternative but part of the mainstream. Energy therapies and other forms of CAM are based on the ancient notion that living matter possesses some special vital force or energy that is separate from matter. Today this energy is mistakenly associated with electromagnetic or quantum fields. However, no evidence for any special vital forces, energies, or fields has ever been found. Modern physics has shown that energy and matter are the same entity and finds no evidence for continuous fields. The quantum fields of theoretical physics are directly connected, one-to-one, to particles, the quanta of the fields. A consistent picture of elementary particles and forces that successfully describes all current observations exists within the framework of the standard model. Living matter is composed of the same particles acted on by the same forces as non-living matter. Quantum mechanics provides no basis for paranormal or holistic claims while all of modem physics remains totally materialistic and reductionistic. No mega-paradigm shift occurred in the twentieth century comparable to that of Newton in the seventeenth century. Reports of extraordinary claims should not be published unless the evidence is extraordinary. The violation of established physical law is sufficient to ignore such claims until extraordinary evidence is presented.

William M. London, Ed.D., M.P.H.May 15, 2001Executive Order 13147 calls for the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](https://www.whccamp.hhs.gov/) make recommendations addressing: - The education and training of health care practitioners in complementary and alternative medicine - Coordinated research to increase knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine practices and products - The provision to health care professionals of reliable and useful information about complementary and alternative medicine that can be made readily accessible and understandable to the general public - Guidance for appropriate access to and delivery of complementary and alternative medicine In making these recommendations, the Committee should acknowledge that the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" implies much more than the definition used by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) covers a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. Generally, it is defined as those treatments and healthcare practices not taught widely in medical schools, not generally used in hospitals, and not usually reimbursed by medical insurance companies. The NCCAM definition is similar to the definition of \"unconventional medicine\" in a paper by Eisenberg and others [1] who reported on a national telephone survey of adult use of methods such as relaxation techniques, massage, exercise, prayer, self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. This study is often misrepresented as evidence that Americans are so interested in \"complementary and alternative medicine\" that NIH funding of CAM research is needed. (The terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" have far more promotional value than \"unconventional.\") Many of the methods included in the Eisenberg survey are either self-care or medically establshed methods that don't fit the study's definition of \"unconventional medicine.\" [2] The study actually showed that few survey respondents used commercially promoted methods such as acupuncture, homeopathy, energy healing, megavitamin therapy, and herbal medicine. Strangely, 30% of respondents who reported use of chiropractic didn't actually see a provider of chiropractic services. The NCCAM definition has little to do with the meaning of \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" in everyday language. These words imply that such methods actually complement or serve as sensible alternatives to other methods. The \"CAM\" marketplace is dominated by products, services, and regimens that do not. The American Heritage Dictionary defines complementary as: \"1. Forming or serving as a complement; completing. 2. Supplying mutual needs or offsetting mutual lacks.\" [3] Thus, referring to something as \"complementary medicine\" implies that it completes what some other medicine does not do on its own. However, just because someone refers to a method as complementary does not mean it actually complements anything else. If a method doesn't add to the outcome, it isn't complementary; it just adds to the cost. The American Heritage Dictionary defines alternative, when used as an adjective, as: \" 1. Allowing or necessitating a choice between two or more things. 2.a Existing outside traditional or established institutions or systems: an alternative lifestyle. b. Espousing or reflecting values that are different from those of the establishment.\" [3] The NCCAM definition suggests that \"alternative\" medicine is \"alternative\" in the sense of dictionary definition 2a. To some extent this is a fair characterization. However, \"alternative\" medicine is largely \"traditional\" itself and it has become its own \"establishment.\" Promoters of \"alternative\" medicine often promote traditional systems for alleged healing. Strong reliance on tradition is one of \"alternative\" medicine's biggest problems. Tradition-bound systems resist change. Their proponents selectively seek affirming evidence while rejecting disconfirming evidence and criticism. Proponents adhere to orthodoxy. On the other hand, science/evidence-based medicine is iconoclastic. Medical practice changes over time because scientifically-based practitioners learn to discard unsafe and ineffective methods. Traditionalists and true-believers cling to unsafe and ineffective methods as a matter of faith. I am unaware of any efforts by the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine and later by the NCCAM to identify methods promoted as \"complementary\" or \"alternative\" that should be discarded. In order to provide reliable and useful information about complementary and alternative medicine, it is necessary to identify methods that should be discarded. I ask that the WHCCAMP make recommendations to accomplish this based on [principles of consumer protection and science](http://www.ncahf.org/about/mission.html) and recognition that [health fraud and quackery](http://www.ncahf.org/pp/definitions.html) constitute a public health scandal [4]. Much has been written about the \"medical establishment\" and its institutions and systems of delivering medical care. I think it is fair to note the existence of the \"'alternative' medical establishment\" which includes promoters, practitioners, organizations, foundations, retail businesses, wholesale businesses, politicians, the NCCAM, the WHCCAMP, and other institutions. The \"alternative\" medical establishment has even extended its reach into medical schools, other professional schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, and insurance plans. In so doing, alternativists have increased their power and, in effect, invalidated the NCCAM definition of complementary and alternative medicine. \"Alternative\" medicine is alternative in the sense of espousing or reflecting different values. The science-based medical establishment insists that health products and services be proved safe and effective\u2014with proponents bearing the burden of proof\u2014before promoting them. Alternativists often value hunches, clinical impressions, subjectivity, anecdotes, reports of best cases, legends, and so-called \"other ways of knowing,\" as sufficient \"proof\" to justify their promotional efforts. They tend not to value efforts to identify sources of clinical illusions and to reduce the problems of systematic and nonsystematic errors leading to faulty conclusions. Alternativists also value different credentials and standards of practice than most consumers expect. Many \"alternative\" credentials and standards of practice do not require professional accountability. I believe the WHCCAMP should note that this poses a problem for consumers. Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer, former editors of The New England Journal of Medicine, have pointed out: There cannot be two kinds of medicine-conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work [5]. Medical alternatives can be classified into three categories: genuine, experimental, and questionable [6,7]. - Genuine alternatives are backed by sufficient scientific evidence showing that the potential for benefit exceeds the potential for harm to specific populations for specific intended purposes. Genuine alternatives or genuinely complementary methods tend not to require the justification of labels like \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" in marketing. - Experimental methods are unproven, but are studied responsibly with extra care given to the rights of study participants and protecting participants from exploitation. It is reasonable for taxpayers to expect that their financial support will be used to study promising rather than implausible methods. But many taxpayers don't realize that alternativists do not espouse such values. Alternativists have no problem with taxpayers supporting the study of implausible methods. Remarkably, NCCAM is currently funding a study of an \"alternative\" protocol involving enzyme supplements and coffee enemas in the treatment of people with pancreatic cancer. The protocol is implausible [8]. It had been used on a Hodgkin's lymphoma patient who died. Last year a jury found that the patient was 51% responsible for her harm. The jury said that the patient was \"negligent\" in letting the physician treat her and for foregoing the standard care her original doctors had recommended [9]. - Questionable methods are those fthat are unproven but lack a scientifically plausible rationale. Some of these are still promoted even after repeated failures in scientific testing. Such methods aren't just unproven; they are\u2014for practical purposes\u2014disproved. The most implausible questionable methods are legitimately described as dubious or quack. According to a usage dictionary, \"alternative\" may suggest adequacy for some purpose and/or \"compulsion to choose.\" [10] Questionable and dubious methods are not adequate for their intended purpose, and consumers should not feel compelled to choose them. It is unavoidable for responsible healthcare professionals to use unproven methods in caring for patients. We will never have all the answers to address the complexities of human health problems. Clinical judgment and innovation will always be an essential part of the art of delivering healthcare. However, responsible healthcare professionals do not promote the use of unproven methods. The promotion of unproven methods through such methods as advertising and publicity is objectionable because it is deceptive. It violates the ethical principles of veracity and nonmaleficence (the general duty of \"first do no harm\"). Consumers want alternatives, but they want genuine alternatives. Many promoters of \"alternative\" medicine exploit this by calling for \"freedom of choice\" for consumers. What these promoters really want is freedom from accountability to consumers. They support the concept of caveat emptor (\"let the buyer beware\") and oppose the concept of caveat vendor (\"let the seller beware\"). Caveat vendor provides a rationale for consumer protection laws to compensate for the disadvantageous bargaining position consumers have in the health marketplace. It is difficult to evaluate claims for health products and services. People are especially vulnerable to mistaken perception and deception when they feel threats to their well-being and are desperate for answers. It is important to protect consumers from both intentional and unintentional deception. And it is also important to preserve true freedom of choice. Thus, the motto of The National Council Against Health Fraud is: \"Enhancing freedom of choice through reliable information.\" Recommendations NCAHF urges the Commission to enhance freedom of choice by recognizing the need to identify health fraud and quackery masquerading as \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine. In line with the four topics you are charged to address: - The education and training of health care practitioners must address principles of consumer protection and science. Health care practitioners must learn to recognize quackery/health fraud associated with \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine. - WHCCAMP should promote opportunities for research to increase knowledge about quackery/health fraud as a public-health problem associated with the \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine marketplace [4]. - WHCCAMP should declare that it is misleading to use the terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" to refer to questionable, unproven, and disproved methods. Reliable and useful information must be grounded in principles of consumer protection and science. - WHCCAMP should recommend that appropriate access and delivery of healthcare be based on principles of consumer protection and science.

I have an interest in science and am increasingly worried by the growing prevalence of junk science and the irrationality of the \"New Age movement\" which, if not unchallenged, will impede scientific and technological progress. Quackwatch has become my first stop on the Internet for answers to my medical questions. I wish that there were more Web sites that tell the actual facts about health issues. Instead, the Internet, magazines, and radio and television broadcasts are saturated with medical nonsense. It appears that every quack in the world is getting his or her \"fifteen minutes of fame,\" whereas the voices of medical reason seem to be few and far between. There is clearly a battle between the proponents of \"alternative\" medicine and those of science-based medicine. I wish that I could say that the good guys are winning. But to be quite honest, I'm not at all sure that is the case, particularly in light of the many people I know with strong beliefs in \"alternative\" modalities. I have tried my best to educate them and have given them articles that I have downloaded from Quackwatch, but it is virtually impossible to reason with them. They have such an irrational hatred for the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry that they would rather believe in the metaphysical nonsense of [Gary Null](../../04ConsumerEducation/null.html) and Bernie Siegel than go to a doctor. Many people who admire Drs. Andrew Weil and [Deepak Chopra](../../04ConsumerEducation/chopra.html) probably have no idea that they believe in some very weird and strange things. Andrew Weil for instance has said that many of his basic insights about the causes of diseases and the nature of healing come from \"stone thinking,\" that is, thoughts experienced while under the influence of psychedelic agents or during other states of \"altered consciousness\" induced by trances, ritual magic, hypnosis and mediation. He has said that \"stoned thinking\" has advantages over \"straight thinking.\" Among them are a greater reliance on intuition and an acceptance of the ambivalent nature of things, which to him means \"the coexistence of opposites that appear to be mutually antagonistic.\" Any doctor who said those things would probably have his medical license revoked. Weil has also said: My intuitions about disease are that its physical manifestations are mostly caused by nonmaterial factors, in particular by unnatural restraints placed on the unconscious mind and second, that the limits to what human consciousness can cause in the physical body are far beyond where most of us imagine them. Since leaving the world of the allopathic practice, I have witnessed a number of impressive non-allopathic cures of dramatic illnesses, including cancer and life-threatening infections. Faith healing is held in contempt by most rational people, despite the abundant evidence of cures. I have seen Weil on television saying that energy healers cured him of a cold and that LSD might be a viable treatment for curing allergies. I wish that I was making these things up, but I'm not. This is not science; it is New Age metaphysical junk. It is also very dangerous, given the large number of people who respect and admire Weil for his so called \"pioneering work\" and expertise in \"alternative\" medicine. Weil is indeed an expert\u2014at fooling the public and perhaps even himself. He has proven nothing, done no clinical trials, and published no research reports in any reputable medical journal. Yet, like a magician, he is praised for creating the illusion of something out of nothing. As for Chopra, I can't understand why anyone would trust somebody who claims that he has levitated and who says that \"if you think happy, you will have happy molecules.\" I suspect that many people who buy his books don't actually read them because if they did, they would never buy another one again. His beliefs include the idea that \"illness and aging are an illusion and we can achieve an ageless body and a timeless mind by the sheer force of consciousness.\" Try telling people with cancer that their illness is an illusion and can be cured by happy thoughts. Most of what Chopra advocates is typical New Age babble. For example, he says that (a) a person is a field of vibrating energy, information and intelligence connected to the entire cosmos; (b) all organs of the body are built from a specific sequence of vibrations; (c) when organs are sick, they are vibrating improperly; (d) certain herbs and aromas can help to restore proper vibrations; (e) certain gems and crystals can rejuvenate human skin; and (f) good thoughts can reverse the aging process.\" How does he know all this? Simple, because he believes it to be true and as a result, it is unnecessary for him to prove it. Personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as \"alternative\" medicine. The word alternative implies choosing between two valid approaches that hopefully will have a similar outcome. But there is no such thing as alternative medicine, just as there is no such thing as Chinese or Indian medicine. There is only medicine that has been proven to be effective. But the proponents of \"alternative\" medicine are under the misguided belief that if you believe something, it doesn't have to be proven. One fervent believer told me that whatever modality you choose will only work if you believe it will work. However, antibiotics, for example, will do their job whether the patients believes in them or not. That certainly is not the case with homeopathic products. When I asked a believer in homeopathy if she understood the principles behind it, she replied that homeopathic products contain the \"essence\" of the original substance and therefore exert a very powerful curative impact. I was so stunned that I didn't know how to reply. Homeopathic medicine is actually the essence of nothing. I've learned that there is little or no use trying to reason with believers in metaphysical medicine, especially those who believe there is a conspiracy to destroy \"alternative medicine.\" According to the \"true\" believers, mainstream doctors are wedded to outmoded thinking and refuse to accept the reality that \"alternative medicine works.\" All you have to do is eat macrobiotically, practice visualization techniques, take homeopathic medicine, think happy thoughts, go for acupuncture treatments, take herbal baths, become a vegetarian, don't eat refined sugar and meditate. I wish that it were that easy. I wish that a macrobiotic diet could cure cancer, homeopathic medicine could cure pneumonia, or thinking positively could cure Parkinson's disease. If such was indeed the case, we could save billions of dollars in medical costs and tens of thousands of lives. But it's not that simple. The human body is very complex and requires more than positive thinking or eliminating meat from your diet to cure it. If indeed \"alternative\" practitioners did have the answers, it would be very easy for them to prove it and clear up any doubts. But they don't want to do that. When Andrew Weil was asked during a \"60 Minutes\" interview why he doesn't perform clinical trials, he replied that he was not a clinical researcher. But without well-designed studies, how can he know that his methods actually work? To him, apparently, belief is far more important than scientific evidence. Virtually all the advocates of \"alternative\" medicine share this view. In Reclaiming our Health, John Robbins, a New Age devotee, vegan, and animal rights activist, states that \"many conditions, including most forms of cancer, viral infections, allergic and autoimmune disorders, and most chronic degenerative diseases . . . are more effectively handled with alternative approaches.\" This is statement is startling, but he provides no evidence to back it up. As noted by the prominent astronomer and skeptic Carl Sagan, \"Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.\" But for the \"alternative\" crowd, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary belief. The believers in \"alternative\" medicine castigate drugs because of their side effects. Instead, they espouse herbs, even though many herbs also have side effects and some are quite dangerous. But there is a misconception that because something is natural it can't possibly be dangerous. Try taking hemlock and see how benign it is. And many other herbs are harmful. Aloe and arnica, for example, should not be ingested, while periwinkle, pennyroyal, squill, petasite, and tansy are quite dangerous. It worries me that many people self-medicate with products that they literally know nothing about and that many rely on the advice of salespeople at their local \"health food\" or \"natural food\" outlets. Don't they realize that they are playing Russian Roulette with their health? Modern medicine is not perfect. Doctors make terrible mistakes. Many drugs are overprescribed and have troublesome side effects. People die unnecessarily in hospitals. Some doctors are greedy, incompetent, and unsympathetic. Some operations are not necessary. Doctors often don't spend enough time getting to know their patients. But despite its faults, modern medicine is infinitely better than the quackery of \"alternative\" medicine.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-thirty-five) [\"Alternative Medicine\" and the Psychology of Belief](https://quackwatch.org/related/altpsych/) In 1988, I was part of a six-person delegation from the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) that visited the People's Republic of China. We had been invited to investigate (a) Qi Gong, a vitalistic belief system that, among other things, is employed to diagnose and heal disease, and (b) the abilities of a group of children who, it was claimed, could read with their armpits. During our stay in Beijing, I developed a very sore throat, due, I thought, to the visibly polluted air.

In 1988, I was part of a six-person delegation from the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) that visited the People's Republic of China. We had been invited to investigate (a) Qi Gong, a vitalistic belief system that, among other things, is employed to diagnose and heal disease, and (b) the abilities of a group of children who, it was claimed, could read with their armpits. During our stay in Beijing, I developed a very sore throat, due, I thought, to the visibly polluted air. This made it difficult to engage in conversations and deliver the speeches that were expected of us. Eventually, I was taken to the outpatient clinic at Beijing Hospital, where, after a very brief examination, was given two medications. The first, labeled in both Chinese and English, was erythromycin, an antibiotic. That seemed reasonable enough for what I thought to be a bronchial infection. The second medication was labeled \"Chuanbeiye,\" with the chief ingredients listed as \"snake bile, tendril-leafed fritillary bulb, and almond, etc.\" Our interpreter assured me that she always relied on the snake bile preparation whenever she had any throat problems, but despite her earnest testimonial, I declined to use it. I relied instead upon the erythromycin, and within a few days, my throat recovered. Offered folk medicine and snake oil, I had chosen scientific Western medicine and was healed by it. Or so I thought. After our return from China, Paul Kurtz recounted this incident in an article in CSICOP's journal, the Skeptical Inquirer. A few months later, a physician responded in letter to the editor: All too often bronchial infections are due to viruses and therefore not treatable with antibiotics. Unfortunately, there is such a demand from the lay public to treat everything with antibiotics that it is not unusual for the encumbered physician to prescribe them for infections they know cannot be helped by antibiotics. . . . If this was a viral infection, then the antibiotic and the snake bile were of equal efficacy [1]. But I got better, didn't I? Doesn't that tell me that the antibiotic worked? When we talk about the appeal of this treatment or that treatment, this is what is at the heart of it all\u2014we use medicines because they seem to work. If we get better, we naturally credit the treatment (whether it had any effect or not). And when we do not improve, we naturally assume that the treatment did not work, and we may then seek out other therapies that might. So-called alternative or complementary therapies are popular only to the extent that they can satisfy some people's needs better than conventional medical therapies do. If every visit to the family physician cured our complaints and satisfied our needs (the two are not necessarily the same), then the vast majority of people would never consider alternate therapies. And if, once people tried alternative therapies, they did not seem to be effective, most people would stop using them and they would eventually die out. It is a mistake to assume that people who use unproven or even disproven therapies are generally less rational, less sensible, or even less educated than those who do not. Most surveys show that users of alternative medicine tend to have more years of formal education than nonusers\u2014a by-product of the fact that these users must generally pay out of their own pockets and thus must have more disposable income [2]. No one that I have ever met would knowingly submit to treatment that he or she believed to be totally useless or harmful. We pursue a therapy because we believe\u2014or at least hope\u2014that it may work. (This may not apply, of course, to the radical fringe, people for whom use of alternative medicine is an integral part of an overarching sociopolitical, antiscience, or New Age worldview.) The interesting question is how we come to believe that a therapy may be worthwhile. And since none of us is likely (even if we possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and wherewithal) to carry out clinical trials before choosing a treatment for the first time, we must ultimately base our initial decision on our faith in others' opinions and even, perhaps, others' research. However, once we decide to try a therapy, our own experience becomes very important, and a variety of psychological factors come into play that may help persuade us that the therapy is effective, even if it is not. Most people turn to and believe in alternative therapies for the same reasons they turn to and believe in evidence-based medicine. Most users of alternative medicine are ignorant of, and uninterested in, the theoretical basis of homeopathy or chiropractic or naturopathy, just as most users of evidence-based medicine are ignorant of and uninterested in its theoretical underpinnings. Physicians have taught us not to enquire too much about what is in this tablet or how that injection works. We wouldn't be able to understand it anyway, and after all, we have come to the physician because we trust that he or she understands so that we don't have to. Most people who keep using alternative therapies do so because they believe it helps, just as is the case with those who continue to go back for treatment with evidence-based therapies. In the end, it boils down to what our individual belief systems incline us to accept as evidence. This article discusses how we learn about causality, how our beliefs and our trust develop, and how this shapes our concepts of illness and healing. It is through these mechanisms that people come to have confidence in any therapy, evidence-based or not, and effective or not. How We Learn About Causality When I stated earlier that the antibiotic made me better, what did that statement actually mean? In reality, all that happened was that two events occurred in succession: One, I took the medicine, and two, not too long afterwards, I felt better. Yet, my conclusion was a causal one: The medicine made me better. That is consistent with my limited knowledge of medicine and my expectations. Since I knew nothing directly about the causal link, or even for sure if there was one, my judgement was really magical thinking. Magical thinking describes what happens when we experience two successive events and conclude that the first event caused the second, without any concern for the putative causal link. All humans are to some degree magical thinkers. Until recently, most psychologists used to think that textbook logic and reasoning practices were the \"default mode,\" and that when people engaged in magical or superstitious thinking it was some kind of pathology, a deviation from the inbred norm. Research has taught us, however, that magical thinking (i.e., \"quick-and-dirty\" reasoning tactics that get it more or less right a sufficient portion of the time to be useful) is our first line of attack when reckoning with the world\u2014logical, analytical reasoning is a fragile add-on that must be painstakingly learned [3-5]. We actually have two quite distinct information-processing systems in our brains and nervous systems that lead us to conclusions about causality. On the one hand, we learn quickly from direct experience. Put your finger in a live lamp socket, and your experience quickly teaches you not to do that again. This is experiential learning. No knowledge of electricity, no understanding of physics, is necessary. A dumb animal would learn as quickly not to touch the socket again. On the other hand, we also process information in an intellectual manner, through reasoning, logic, and analysis. Through intellectual learning, we come to know that a flow of electrons races down our finger when we touch a live contact point in the socket, and we can learn to avoid touching sockets even if we have never had any direct experience with them. Experiential Learning Experiential learning occurs at a primitive level\u2014it is automatic, rapid, and often tied up with emotional reactions. It requires no formal teaching, no practice, no theoretical understanding, no contemplation, no logic. It is based on patterns that we detect in the world around us. We enter this world superbly equipped to learn quickly about our environment. Our nervous systems are bombarded with an unending shower of sensory stimulation from both within and without our bodies. We are able at birth to begin to find patterns in this stimulation, to make sense out of it. To do so we rely on two factors\u2014temporal contiguity and stimulus generalization. By temporal contiguity, I mean that events that occur closely together in time have a special impact on our nervous systems; they set up an \"association\" in our brains. Touch a hot stove, feel pain, and the nervous system \"learns\" to avoid the hot stove. And then, by the process of stimulus generalization, one learns not only to avoid that stove, the one that caused the pain, but other stoves and any object that looks similar to that stove. In other words, without the need for any reasoning or logic or words or understanding, we quickly internalize some \"knowledge\" about the world\u2014don't touch stoves; they cause pain. The importance of such learning for survival is obvious. Yet, again, note the imputation of causality, when all we really experience is temporal contiguity. This applies just as readily to positive outcomes: Take a pill and the headache goes away. We attribute the pain relief to the pill. Asymmetric effect of pairing and nonpairing. It is important to understand, as I have discussed in detail elsewhere [6,7], that we do not easily unlearn associations between important events. If the infant, by accident, touches the same stove a day later, but this time it is cold and so no pain occurs, his or her nervous system does not simply reset to itself to zero so far as stoves are concerned. Obviously, this would not be very adaptive in terms of our survival: The rabbit that encounters a snarling, biting fox and lives to remember it would not be well served by a nervous system that unlearns the fear of foxes, just because on one occasion, the rabbit encounters a fox that makes no effort to turn it into dinner. The association set up by the co-occurrence of two significant events is not easily undone. If your migraine went away last week when you took a pill, but did not abate when you took another pill today, would you decide that the pill does not work after all? Not likely. Intermittent reinforcement. Indeed, what happens if, ten times in a row, the child accidentally brushes against the stove, but the stove is cool? With an accumulation of such experiences, the association between stove and pain will gradually weaken, but\u2014and this is a very important \"but\"\u2014if every now and then touching the stove produces pain, this results in an even more enduring association between stove and pain, for one automatically learns that the fact that the stove was harmless enough\u2014even a number of times in a row\u2014does not mean that it will not burn the next time. Occasional, intermittent reinforcement produces even more enduring associations than continuous reinforcement \u2014 if you doubt this fact, just watch the \"one-armed bandit\" players in any casino for a while. The intermittent reinforcement effect is just as true for the pill that is followed by relief every now and then, if there is no other apparent relief mechanism available. Superstitious conditioning. I have been discussing a situation where there actually is a causal relationship between the hot stove and pain and perhaps between pill and relief. However, our nervous systems have no direct way of knowing that. That conclusion belongs to the realm of reason, not experience. Suppose that by happenstance, a child reaches for a new toy just as there is a terrible clap of thunder that frightens him or her. The association will be set up between toy and the fearful noise, and the child may from now on avoid that toy. This is referred to as superstitious conditioning. It is interesting to note that the term \"superstitious\" is applied by the observer who knows that there really is not a causal link. In fact, most of the time, when we are inferring causality, we cannot really tell whether there is a causal link or not. We take the vitamin C and feel better, or we don't catch a cold; did one cause the other? We are likely to think so \u2014 especially if we have other reasons\u2014authority, testimonials, and beliefs consistent with that interpretation. Only very careful and time-consuming research can really tell us whether there is any causality involved at all. Intellectual Learning Be that as it may, while our experiential learning is of vital importance for survival, the major reason that we have triumphed over other species and made them part of our food chain, rather than the other way around, is that we possess relatively advanced cognitive abilities. With our rich heritage of logical analysis and our culturally-codified knowledge base, we are able, through contemplation, to estimate the value and meaning of most things around us. And through our highly efficacious communication abilities, we can teach our children about \"how things work,\" without the need for them to go out and experience everything firsthand, or to develop intellectual understanding from basic principles. (Now, if we could only get them to pay attention!) Yet, we have to learn how to learn in this way. We have to learn logic. We have to learn how to organize our knowledge into categories and categories into an explanatory framework. We have to learn that surface appearances don't always relate to underlying realities. And just as it took civilization thousands of years to develop what we think of today as logic and scientific inquiry, so each individual spends many years in formal education. In this way, each of us is taught how to think in a logical manner, although, strangely enough, not all that much of children's formal education is devoted to developing logical abilities that will serve them well in everyday life. There is no reason why we could not teach children in grade 5 about the need for double-blind randomized clinical trials, especially if we used age-appropriate, attention-grabbing examples. They could understand, and it would be a big step towards fostering critical thinkers, savvy consumers, and informed voters. Human beings are constantly seeking to \"understand.\" We want explanations for events around us. What was that noise in the garage? There should be no one in there\u2014is it a raccoon, a burglar, the wind, or am I just \"hearing things\"? Why isn't my doctor curing my condition? We make causal attributions continually\u2014the floor is wet because the shower curtain was not all the way into the bathtub. The tree branch was blown down by the wind. Martha ignored me because she is envious. Harry was nice to me because he wants to borrow some money. I got better because I took the erythromycin. And most of us are uncomfortable when we are unable to assign causes to events. \"Harry is floating in midair. Shucks, that is strange; but I don't have an explanation, so I will just forget about it.\" Martha recovered from terminal cancer, when the doctors said she would die\u2014it must have been the laetrile that saved her, or it must have been the prayer. Most of us, in our personal lives, have a hard time accepting ambiguity, accepting that sometimes we just don't know. Conflicts between the Experiential and the Intellectual As determined as we may be to base our decisions on fact, not faith; intellect, not emotion; reason, not rhetoric; we can do so only up to a point. Like it or not, our lives are to a considerable degree governed by primitive associations hardened into our nervous systems by experience. There will be times where we \"know\" one thing intellectually, but \"feel\" strongly something else. You may \"know\" that the garter snake in the cage cannot really hurt you, but you cannot push yourself to touch it. You may \"know\" that flying through turbulence is not dangerous and no different than being on a motor boat on some choppy water, but nonetheless, you may feel irrational, even incapacitating, fear. What do we do when faced with the choice between going with logic or emotion, reason or intuition? As much as we may be dedicated to reason, emotion has a very forceful way of making us an offer that is hard to refuse. As the public speaker seized by stage fright knows all too well, we cannot by virtue of rationality or willpower simply turn off those powerful feelings\u2014and they are often impossible to ignore. Sometimes, the easiest way to reduce the conflict is to bring the intellect into line with the emotions, because most often we cannot do the opposite [8]. \"Yes, airplanes are dangerous\u2014my fear is justified.\" And if evidence-based medicine can't cure you, and alternative medicine says it can, which do you believe? Many people experience a decrease in anxiety if they accept the alternative healer's claims, and that anxiety relief may thwart whatever challenges are mounted by data and intellect. Beliefs Our beliefs are, in essence, our expectations about the world around us. I believe the road continues on the other side of the hill. I believe that submitting to surgery will take away the pain in my belly, even it the pain initially increases. I believe that oil of tangerine will cure my headaches. But where do our beliefs originate? - From direct experience: I had a bad headache, took oil of tangerine and it went away. - From watching others: Mum always took oil of tangerine whenever she had a headache. - From logical, analytical thought\u2014evaluating research on oil of tangerine. - From authority, being taught directly by parents, teachers, media: \"Now children, don't forget to take your oil of tangerine.\" Authority is, of course, a primary source of belief. We spend many years in school, being pushed to master sets of facts provided by authority, most of which we have very limited means to challenge. Similarly, the media bombard us with assertions that many are inclined to accept because, \"They couldn't say that on TV if it weren't true, could they?\" And our most unshakeable beliefs are often those for which we have no direct experiential support, but have come down to us from one authority or another, and are shared by people around us. For example, we learn that the earth is not flat\u2014despite whatever our direct experience of it might suggest, and even though it is the rare person indeed who has ever actually tried to conduct research into the claim. Most would not even know where to begin. But we do not hear many people expressing doubt on the matter. We all accepted what was, initially at least, handed down by authority. And if someone in authority, even if that authority is self-proclaimed, tells me to reduce the amount of fat in my diet in order to preserve my health, or tells me to take St. John's Wort if I am depressed, why shouldn't I believe? Our beliefs become integrated into a fabric that makes them difficult to change, even if information that contradicts them comes along [9]. If I come to believe that chiropractic is effective therapy, then even if research studies find no benefit, \"it must work\u2014it helped my back, my uncle swears by it, health insurance covers it, a regulatory body supervises it. One study isn't going to convince me that all those people are wrong.\" This is as true for our personal beliefs about aspirin or penicillin as it is for chiropractic or Echinacea. Of course, the social support resulting from a sharing of belief is important. If you have never heard of oil of tangerine until I mention it, you may hesitate to take it, but if you have read testimonials about its virtues; if you have other acquaintances who use it, it is more likely that you will try it, and you will want it to work. You may reason, \"What's the harm\u2014if it doesn't work, at least it can't hurt me\"\u2014or so many people are predisposed to believe about alternative therapies. Of course, we do learn to be skeptical, too. We soon learn that not all sources of information are equally reliable, and as we become better educated by life, we come to accept information from some sources almost without question, while routinely discrediting information from other sources. But how do we choose our sources, our authorities? I allow certain people wearing white coats to inject substances into my veins, almost at their whim, or to put their fingers in orifices that they were not designed to enter, without being told anything other than the potion or the prodding will have a therapeutic or diagnostic benefit. Yet, certain other people in white coats who may want to give my neck a good twist or insert tiny needles into my skin with the promise of bringing benefit I do not allow near me. Why not? We all have learned to choose our authorities. Illness and Healing Now let's turn to a series of questions about illness and healing: How Do We Know We Are Ill? Language is a wonderful tool for disseminating knowledge about most things in our world. However, since we have no method of determining whether or not a child is in pain, or whether or not a child is frightened or worried, except by judging his or her behavior, how do we know what a child is feeling? Of course, we do not, not before the child can talk. We may measure the child's temperature and decide that there is fever, but is the inference that the child feels in pain or sickly necessarily correct? We don't know. We teach young children about their emotional states, about pain, about sickness, by our judgments of what they must be feeling or should be feeling. We teach them the language of pain and illness: \"I feel like I am going to die\" or, \"It's nothing, just a flesh wound.\" We teach children to relax or to worry, based on our reactions to our definition of what is going on inside them. We teach children\u2014and this is in part culturally based of course, a sick role\u2014how they are to react\u2014to be passive, dependent, let the parent or doctor take care of them [10]. And since, even as we grow up, the innards of our bodies remain to a very large extent unknown to us, we teach children to rely for the most part on other people\u2014on authorities\u2014to tell them what is wrong and to fix the problem. We learn that when we are sick, our job as patient is to follow orders and the doctor's job is to make us better. But I come back to the question of how we know we are sick. Generally, it is simply because we don't feel well, or we are vomiting, or we are always tired, or we experience pain, dizziness, or difficulty moving. None of these necessarily means that we are have a disease, but we are likely to view them as problems that need treatment. Indeed, some people grow up learning to interpret many aspects of emotional distress as having a physical rather than an emotional basis [11]. And so we go to the physician or homeopath or chiropractor. How Do We Choose a Therapist or Therapy? The choice of therapy brings us back to the subject of authority again. For most people, credentials are very important. But what are credentials? A Doctor of Medicine has credentials. A Doctor of Chiropractic has credentials, as does a Doctor of Naturopathy or a Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine. How is the public to choose among them? A Doctor is a Doctor is a Doctor to most people. When pharmacies promote herbal remedies alongside pharmaceuticals, when the nursing profession does not speak out against laying on of hands (\"therapeutic touch\"), and supposedly responsible media programs tout the benefits of unproven therapies, how is the public to choose among the various credentialed authorities? Not even looking for a basis in science is enough: Just as during wartime, when each nation proclaims that \"God is on our side,\" so too do most promoters of therapy\u2014whether conventional or alternative\u2014claim science as their ally. Homeopathy, we are told, has passed scientific muster. Chiropractic is described as an art and a science and a philosophy. Say, which is that \"scientific\" medicine again? Moreover, we happen to live in an age where there is, in many quarters, a growing distrust of established authorities. Today's distrust of authority is based in part on a devolution of social power that brings more and more decision making to the level of the individual, leaving less and less control in the hands of politicians, priests, physicians, and professors. On the whole, this is probably a positive development. However, when people are encouraged to make choices about health care, but are missing the tools they need to weigh one therapy against another, they are not necessarily better off, and may sometimes be much worse off, than when designated authorities made such decisions for them. What if the Therapist Says There Is Nothing Wrong? What if the family physician informs you that the vomiting is due to stress and you should change careers, or tells you that your pain is just something that you will have to live with? Doctors are supposed to make us well. There is nothing in television advertising that says \"Live with your headaches\" or \"There is not a pill for everything.\" If the doctor isn't making us well, then maybe we need another doctor. And if that doctor fails, then maybe we need another kind of therapy\u2014at least one where they promise relief. How Do We Know That a Therapy Works? When we are given therapy for our problem, how do we know it works? I come back to where I started out, with the antibiotic. It works\u2014we surmise\u2014if we feel better. It works if our sore throat goes away or our backache improves or our warts disappear. There are many reasons why we might feel improvement, however, even if the therapy has absolutely no effect. We may feel better after the treatment, even if it really had no effect, because: - We were on our way to recovery anyway, or our symptoms fluctuate and we interpreted a temporary improvement as being due to the treatment. - We never really had the disease\u2014the symptoms were psychosomatic;. - We believed that the therapy would work, and therefore relaxed and slept better and ate better and helped our bodies along in that way. Perhaps the therapy motivated other things that were helpful\u2014e.g., given a natural medicine and told to avoid alcohol, we moderated our drinking; given a spinal manipulation, we came away feeling that the therapist really cares about us; given a herb, we mobilized the joint more, despite some initial pain. - We want to believe that we are getting better, and so we reinterpret the symptoms and minimize their severity. These and other factors [12], can lead us to perceive improvement in our symptoms as being caused by the treatment, thereby validating both therapy and therapist, and setting into play a new round of testimonials. Incidentally, if \"feeling better\" is one criterion for judging a therapy as effective, what happens if we did not feel bad in the first place? Consider this: Research indicates that at least one-third of all patients do not comply with the medical regime suggested by their physicians [13]. Noncompliance is a particular problem when patients do not know they have a problem until they undergo a routine checkup. For example, even though hypertension can lead to stoke, heart failure, renal failure, and blindness, between 75 and 90 percent of patients diagnosed with this disorder fail to take their medication regularly or follow other recommendations[14]. Why such noncompliance? In part, it may be because the symptoms of hypertension are not usually obvious to the patient, who may wish to minimize the perceived threat by persuading him- or herself that there really is not a problem. This is a kind of \"alternative nonmedicine\" \u2014 if you feel all right, don't take anything! However, there is more to it than that. The research literature shows that patients comply more when they regard their physician as caring, friendly, and interested in them[15]. Patients are also more likely to comply when physicians make definite follow-up appointments in order to monitor progress [16]. This again points to an advantage that some alternative therapists have over conventional physicians\u2014increased specialization and technology and the economics of managed, third-party-payer health care tends to produce a rationing of the leisurely \"bedside manner\" that many patients crave almost as much as effective therapy itself. Alternative healers can cater to this need for reassurance, existential support, and sympathetic human interaction by being more friendly, chatty, taking more time, and scheduling a series of \"maintenance\" or \"wellness\" appointments. This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, unless the alternative healer offers something dangerous, extracts unconscionable sums of money, or diverts the patient from proven therapies. Alternative Medicine vs Scientific Medicine So, when we ask \"What makes people think that alternative remedies work?\" we should first ask ourselves \"What makes people think that conventional medicine works?\" The answer to the two questions is pretty much the same. We think they work largely \"because\" we feel better after taking them, or authorities tell us that we are better. Post hoc ergo propter hoc, after the fact, therefore because of the fact. (Note that I am discussing the reasons for belief in a therapy, and not the efficacy of the therapy, per se). Proponents of alternative therapies are largely winning the public relations war with their hopeful, uplifting messages, whereas proponents of scientific biomedicine have so often assumed that the superiority of their product was self-evident (while underestimating the strength of the \"antidoctor backlash\" in society). Alternative remedies have appeal to the extent that conventional remedies fail to provide relief. Indeed, the areas where alternative therapies seem to have most appeal is in the very areas where conventional therapies are not able to satisfy the expectations of the consumer, e.g., chronic headaches and backaches, low energy, nausea, arthritis, gastrointestinal complaints, allergies, things which are often caused by or exacerbated by stress or emotional disorders. The alternative therapist, through validating the client's complaints (and often his or her unconventional worldview), providing hope for overcoming the complaints, and giving much personal attention and support, can indirectly serve some of the emotional needs that often underlie many complaints that physicians dismiss. They also offer hope for conditions that physicians cannot cure. Remember Chuanbeiye, the snake bile preparation I mentioned at the beginning? On the back of the box is written the following: This is an efficacious drug for sputum crudum, cough, asthma caused by cold, bronchitis and bronchitis chronic, etc. Because it is very sweet and convenient for taking therefore it is very welcomed by diseases at home and abroad. The effective rate that treats these diseases is 96.8% and the apparent effective rate is more than 76.8%. That seems to suggest that some people get better but don't realize it! Whatever the author really meant to say, as patients with a disease, we have to leave it to medical scientists to establish the real effective rate. All our experience tells us about is the apparent effective rate, how often we seem to improve when we take the medicine, whether it actually helps or not. For the reasons I have discussed in this paper, it should not be surprising that alternative medicine is capable of producing \"apparent effective rates\" that are even higher in some circumstances than those produced by evidence-based medicine. Ultimately, therein lies their appeal. References - Cloutier RP. Infection irony. The Skeptical Inquirer 13:331, 1989. - Beyerstein BL. Alternative medicine. Where's the evidence?

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-thirty-three) [Alternative Medicine: A Public Health Perspective](https://quackwatch.org/related/altmed/) A Chinese proverb states that \"the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names.\" To determine whether alternative medicine is science or snake oil, one must define it carefully. Webster's Dictionary defines \"alternative\" as \"a choice between two or more things, only one of which may be chosen.\" Stung by instances in which patients have been lured from life-saving therapy, some alternativists have adopted the more benign-sounding term \"complementary,\" which Webster's defines as \"serving to fill and \"mutually supplying each other's lack.\" \"Complementary medicine\" claims to provide this but actually does not. Modern health care abounds with genuine alternatives, for which reliable information about safety and effectiveness is available. \"Alternative medicine\" is defined by what it is not. Its ... A Chinese proverb states that \"the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names.\" To determine whether alternative medicine is science or snake oil, one must define it carefully. Webster's Dictionary defines \"alternative\" as \"a choice between two or more things, only one of which may be chosen.\" Stung by instances in which patients have been lured from life-saving therapy, some alternativists have adopted the more benign-sounding term \"complementary,\" which Webster's defines as \"serving to fill and \"mutually supplying each other's lack.\" \"Complementary medicine\" claims to provide this but actually does not. Modern health care abounds with genuine alternatives, for which reliable information about safety and effectiveness is available. \"Alternative medicine\" is defined by what it is not. Its methods are not part of standard health care. They not only lack scientific proof of safety and/or effectiveness. They also lack a plausible rationale. The U.S. Public Health Service's Official Attitude In the early 1990s,National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) defined alternative medicines as: Any medical practice or intervention that (a) lacks sufficient documentation in the United States for safety and effectiveness against specific diseases and conditions; (b) is not generally taught in U.S. medical schools; and, (c) is not generally reimbursable by health insurance providers [1] Despite the favorable publicity given to OAM's creation, NIH's position was expressed in bold-face type in the foreword to the book Alternative Medicine; Expanding Medical Horizons: This document does not reflect endorsement of these therapies or recommendations for research by the NIH, the U.S. Public Health Service, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It reports on a series of opinions expressed by nongovernment participants in the workshops . . . . The NIH cautions readers not to seek the therapies described in this document for serious health problems without consultation with a licensed physician. The NIH further cautions that many of the therapies described have not been subjected to rigorous scientific investigation to prove safety or efficacy; and many have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [2]. Marcia Angell, MD, executive editor of New England Journal of Medicine , has stated that the very name \"alternative medicine\" is Orwellian newspeak, because it falsely implies that it is a viable option. She considers the term a new name for snake oil [3]. Experts in the psychology of deception speak of \"sleight of mind\" techniques such as \"doublespeak.\" William Lutz, editor of the Quarterly Journal of Doublespeak, states: Doublespeak is language that pretends to communicate but does not, that makes the bad seem good, the repulsive appear attractive or at least tolerable. It is language that avoids, shifts, or denies responsibility, language at variance with its real or purported meaning. Basic to doublespeak is incongruity; the incongruity between what is said, or left unsaid, and what is; between the word and the referent. It perverts the essential function of language, which is communication, in order to mislead, distort, deceive, circumvent. Doublespeak is the deliberate use of language as a weapon or tool . . . to achieve their ends at the expense of others [4]. Physician Interest Report that physicians are interested in alternative medicine require careful interpretation. Doctors are primarily interested in what their patients are doing. They hear about alternative medicine in the media, so they are curious. Current studies of medical attitudes toward \"alternative\" methods consistently find a combination of interest and ignorance. No data suggest that physicians perceive complementary medicine as useful and/or effective [5]. Unless predisposed to believing in a unscientific ideology, the more doctors learn about these procedures, the more negative their attitudes are likely to become. Popularity among Americans Many reports have misrepresented both the nature of alternative medicine and its popularity. In 1993, Eisenberg and others reported that 34% of Americans used \"unconventional\" medicine [6]. They did not use the term \"alternative.\" The authors actually said that \"unconventional therapies are generally used as adjuncts to conventional therapy rather than as a replacement for it.\" Their survey found that 13% used unspecified \"relaxation techniques\" for insomnia, headache, high blood pressure, digestive problems, anxiety, and depression; 10% used \"chiropractic\" for back problems and arthritis; and 7% used \"massage\" for back problems, sprains or strains. These three categories accounted for 30 of the 34% utilization, and only 36% of the users \"saw a provider,\" reducing the percentage who used providers to 12%. Among the remainder were commercial weight-loss programs (e.g., Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, NutriSystem), health spa methods, and self-help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous). These data did not support the authors' conclusion that the frequency of use of unconventional medicine in the United States was \"far higher than previously reported.\" The FDA's 1968 landmark study [7] found that 1% reported \"ever having used\" a naturopath, but naturopathy didn't even make a showing in 1990. Acupuncture use was under 1%, which was substantially less than the 4% Harris reported in 1987 [8]. The use of homeopaths was very low in both studies\u2014.5% reported \"ever having used\" a homeopath in 1969, while 0.32% used a practitioner in 1990. Only two areas showed a significant increase in use: over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic remedies, both of which are clearly due to aggressive marketing in the face of lax regulation by the FDA. A major homeopathic manufacturer noted that although homeopathy had received much favorable publicity and sales of homeopathic medicines to consumers with little knowledge of homeopathy were \"way up,\" sales to physicians and consumers using the more traditional homeopathic medicines were \"flat.\" [9] A recent study has confirmed that Eisenberg's figures were inflated. Using data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, researchers from Yale University concluded that only 8.3% of Americans used the services of an \"alternative\" provider, with chiropractic use most common (used by 3.3% of the survey population), followed by massage (2%), herbal remedies (1.8%), spritual healing (1.8%), nutritional (0.6%), meditation (0.5%), and homeopathic remedies (0.4%). This survey was more significant because it covered more than twelve times as many people as the Eisenberg study and interviewed a more representative population sample [10]. User Characteristics Most people who clamor for alternative medicine (\"traditional users\") constitute a small segment of society. Such people are often referred to as \"health conscious,\" \"health enthusiasts,\" \"health-seekers,\" and \"the worried of 1,036 Americans funded by the Fetzer Institute and the Institute for Noetic Sciences divided people into 3 groups: 47% modernists 29% heartlanders Of 13% were labeled \"greens,\" and 11% as \"New Agers deeply committed to the inner life.\" Fifty-two percent of cultural creatives reported using alternative health care in the previous year [11]. This is far higher than has been reported for any other group. A 1996 survey of herbal supplement users found that most of the growth in use was coming from \"first time tryers.\" Compared to \"more traditional users,\" the first-timers were: - more likely to have purchased supplements in a supermarket or drug store, vs a health-food store - more likely to be light users of herbal supplements - less likely to also be taking vitamins (overall, 64% of herbal supplement users also took vitamins, 36% did not) - less knowledgeable about the herbs they used - more concerned about the safety and efficacy of the supplements they were trying. A marketing analyst stated that herbal marketers \"were not off to a good start with consumers.\" The high cost of herbal supplements is discouraging to consumers, and less knowledgeable and skeptical new users can easily be disappointed if near-term results do not live up to expectations and claims. The analyst recommended \"education\" by herbal marketers [12]. The use of alternative health care is likely to increase among those \"without much knowledge\" due to the finding that people with persistent health concerns try everything they hear about (dubbed \"rampant empiricism\") [7]. This is likely to be enhanced for practices that do not have the stigma of quackery. Media reports showing health professionals taking an interest in alternative medicine is all the endorsement most people would need to give something a try. It also appears that the public holds many misconceptions about \"alternative\" health care (alt-care). Common Misconceptions In 1994, Washington and Alaska Blue-Cross (WABC) conducted an experiment in which 1,000 subscribers were enrolled on a first-come basis for one-year's coverage of alternative care. The AlternaPath program took in $170,000 and paid out $650,000. Some of the overcosts apparently were due to subscribers stocking up on supplements. Analysis of the data showed differences between consumer perceptions about alt-care and its realities [13]. Misconception #1: Alt-care would save money over time because it emphasizes prevention and wellness. The reality is that in many instances, adding alt-care has increased costs to insurers without providing any measurable benefits. In 1983, Blue Cross of Arizona was forced by the legislature to cover chiropractic on the theory that competition would cut healthcare costs. A 3-year study found an opposite outcome. The average chiropractic case cost was $587, which was 8% higher than surgeons, and 352% higher than general practice MDs. From 1984 to 1986 chiropractic claims rose much faster than hospital or MD costs (70% versus 23% and 33%, respectively). Within 79 categories of service, DCs were the most expensive in 32. Among the most common diagnoses for which DCs render services, their average charges were $370, versus $166 for DOs and $112 for MDs. Despite the increased costs to the system, there was no reduction in hospital admissions for conditions within the scope of chiropractic practice. The volume of chiropractic services increased to the point that by mid-1986, it accounted for more than all physician providers combined within the chiropractic scope of practice [14]. A comparison of DC v hospital outpatient care in the United Kingdom found DC care more expensive, despite being limited to 10 treatments [15]. CHAMPUS, the armed forces program for military dependents, conducted an 18-month demonstration project to determine the cost-effectiveness of chiropractic. It found that chiropractic care added costs to health care programs without improved the health of the insured population [16]. Misconception #2: Alt-care providers look at the whole person. In reality, alt-care providers have a narrow view of disease and its treatment. Acupuncturists place needles on imaginary \"points,\" chiropractors are obsessed with manipulating the spine which according to chiropractic theory is a near-panacea. Naturopaths overemphasize dietary supplements, herbal remedies, and tend to focus on the colon. Homeopaths are supposed to pay attention to emotional complaints, but prescribe medications in the same manner as do regular physicians. Alt-care providers focus more upon patient satisfaction than regular doctors, but much of this is contrived. Practice management seminars teach DCs how to trick their patients into unneeded care, how to rope them for a lifetime of useless \"preventive\" care, and how to make them believe that chiropractice care is \"working.\" Patient deception has been intricately described by sociologists who worked as chiropractic assistants [17]. Misconception #3: Alt-care providers spend more time with patients. In fact, some alt-care practitioners do spend a lot of time with patients, but others do not. Classical homeopaths are trained to spend 30-90 minutes with patients, and to spread treatment over extended time periods, but this is inefficient and unlikely to be acceptable to managed care administrators. Most chiropractic practice-builders emphasize high-volume practices, and teach DCs to train assistants to line up patients so the \"doctor\" can go down the line \"adjusting\" spines. Some high-volume practitioners have reported \"adjusting\" over 300 patients a day. Misconception #4: Alt-care providers focus more on prevention. In reality, alt-care providers make a pretense of practicing preventive medicine by prescribing lots of dubious supplements. But their methods of prevention are apt to be just as unproven as their therapeutic procedures. The reality is that many alt-care providers attack scientifically proven preventive measures (eg, immunization, fluoridation, pasteurization, food irradiation). \"Diversion by a homeopath\" was the most common reason for parental refusal to immunize their children in the United Kingdom [18]. Only a minority of American chiropractors advocate immunization [19]. Naturopaths have traditionally bad-mouth immunization [20]. Misconception #5: Alt-care is more \"natural.\" Here again, people seem to be confused by semantics. Webster's Dictionary defines \"natural\" in many ways, including \"being in accordance with or determined by nature,\" \"untouched by the influences of civilization and society,\" and \"having a form or appearance found in nature.\" Poking acupuncture needles into the skin, swallowing homeopathic concoctions elaborately prepared according to Hahnemannian principles, manipulating the spine, colonic irrigations, or swallowing handfuls of dietary supplements are no more \"natural\" than medical procedures. In the case of fluoridation, alt-care providers have been against this procedure which merely adjusts the level of fluoride in water to mimic the tooth decay prevention seen in areas where fluoride occurs naturally. Immunization also is based upon mimicking naturally-acquired immunity discovered by medical pioneers. Registered dietitians promote food rather than pills for good nutrition, but alt-care providers are notorious for pushing dietary supplements. Alt-care may be low tech, but it is not as natural as science-based medicine. Misconception #5: Alt-care is more \"holistic.\" Acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, and some types of massage therapy are rooted in vitalism, the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force. Supernaturalism is the opposite of the naturalism upon which evidence-based medicine is based. Although most of the alt-care systems named claim to be \"holistic,\" vitalism represents dualism, not holism. Vitalists believe in a Life Force that can exist apart from the physical body. Acupuncturists call the alleged force \"chi,\" chiropractors call interpret herb-induced hallucinations as \"out of body\" experiences. Some have said that the failure of a patient to respond to treatment meant that \"the spirit has decided it is time to leave the body.\" Modern science is truly holistic because it holds that the \"mind\" is a functioning brain that is inseparable from its anatomy, not a metaphysical entity. Conclusions Having tracked health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems for more than 25 years, I conclude that little has changed besides increased attention to nonstandard health practices and a revision of the language used to describe them. Alt-med succeeds because its providers: - use buzz-words that \"nontoxic,\" \"nutritional,\" \"preventive,\" \"holistic,\" \"wellness\"), vaguely understood - employ \"feel good\" methods (herbal uppers & downers, \"pep talks, and hands-on procedures such as massage and manipulation that increase suggestibility [21]. - exploit the wishful thinking of patients - exploit the symbolism of \"good\" vs \"bad\" foods, including the guilt induced by people's pursuit of pleasure - exude self-confidence; - string patients along with a \"never-say-die\" approach. Although these tactics may improve patient satisfaction, they are not compatible with tight-fisted managed care programs. Anyone insuring alt-med should consider the nature of its hard-core users. Many are health neurotics with an insatiable appetite for attention and pill-taking. Alt-care is appealing to some insurers because it is low-tech and dietary supplements are cheaper than medications. The low cost of low-tech methods may offset the propensity of alt-care providers to overtreat, but as a policy-holder, I would not want my premium dollars wasted on alt-care. Insurance carriers should limit alt-care coverage to an optional accessory strictly on a business basis. Should unusual approaches to health and healing be studied? Of course. Should we abandon the scientific method to allow questionable methods to compete openly with those that have met the standards of science and ethical care? Absolutely not. Patient well-being is at stake, and no one has the right to subvert responsible health care. Are some practices mislabeled as \"alternative\" that may be appropriately applied as \"complementary\" therapies as part of the art of medicine? Yes, but these require careful handling to avoid undesirable side-effects in emotionally vulnerable patients. References - NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. General information flyer, 10/4/94.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-thirty) [Questionable Organizations: An Overview](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/nonrecorg/) Promoters of questionable health practices often form organizations to multiply their effectiveness. How can one tell which ones are reliable and which are not? There is no sure way, but ten precautionary questions may help: 1. Are its ideas inside the scientific mainstream? Some groups admit that they were formed because their founders felt alienated from the scientific community. One group that made no secret of this was actually called the American Quack Association, whose main purposes were to provide emotional support to its members, poke fun at their critics, and stimulate positive public feelings toward unconventional practitioners. The group was founded in 1985 by Jonathan Wright, M.D., who became its president, and Roy Kupsinel, M.D., a \"holistic\" practitioner from Florida, who became its vice-president. ... Promoters of questionable health practices often form organizations to multiply their effectiveness. How can one tell which ones are reliable and which are not? There is no sure way, but ten precautionary questions may help: 1. Are its ideas inside the scientific mainstream? Some groups admit that they were formed because their founders felt alienated from the scientific community. One group that made no secret of this was actually called the [American Quack Association](https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aqa.html), whose main purposes were to provide emotional support to its members, poke fun at their critics, and stimulate positive public feelings toward unconventional practitioners. The group was founded in 1985 by Jonathan Wright, M.D., who became its president, and Roy Kupsinel, M.D., a \"holistic\" practitioner from Florida, who became its vice-president. It attracted about 300 members but no longer appears active. 2. Who are its leaders and advisors? The International Society for Fluoride Research may sound respectable, but it is actually an antifluoridation group. The International Academy of Preventive Medicine (now called the International Academy of Nutrition and Preventive Medicine) numbered among its leaders Carlton Fredericks, [Linus Pauling](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/pauling.html), [Lendon Smith,](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/lendonsmith/) and other promoters of questionable nutrition practices. The Health Resources Council was founded by [Gary Null](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/null/) to promote \"alternative\" health methods. 3. What are its membership requirements? Is scientific expertise required\u2014or just a willingness to pay dues? An organization open to almost anyone may be perfectly respectable (like the American Association for the Advancement of Science), but don't let the fact that an individual belongs to it impress you. The International Academy of Nutritional Consultants, the [American Association of Nutritional Consultants](https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aanc.html), the [National Academy of Research Biochemists](https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/narb.html), and the [International Association of Therapeutic Specialists](https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/iats.html) issue attractive certificates, but their only requirement for \"professional membership\" has been payment of a modest fee. Some \"institutes,\" \"research\" centers, and voluntary organizations are simply names adopted by an individual or a few people who wish to make their commercial activities sound more respectable. The National Academy of Sports Medicine, for example, began as a private corporation used for marketing dubious products; and the \"Noble Research Society\" merely marketed a quack device. 4. Does it promote a specific treatment or treatments? Most such groups should be highly suspect. A century ago, valid new ideas were hard to evaluate and often were rejected by the medical community. But today, effective new treatments are quickly welcomed by scientific practitioners and do not need special groups to promote them. The American College for Advancement in Medicine, the main purpose of which has been to promote [chelation therapy](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelation.html), falls into this category. Others include: - The American Academy of Environmental Medicine, which promotes \"clinical ecology\" and the bogus concept of [multiple chemical sensitivity](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mcs.html). - The American Association of Orthopedic Medicine, which promotes prolotherapy. - The American Schizophrenia Association, which promotes megavitamins, and the group's parent organization, the Huxley Institute for Biosocial Research. - The International Health Foundation, which promotes the fad diagnosis of [candidiasis hypersensitivity.](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html) - The Physicians' Association for Eradicating Chronic Disease (which promotes [Maharishi Ayur-Veda](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/chopra/)) - The National Wellness Coalition, whose stated mission is \"to promote wellness principles, policies and practices as the key to affordable, effective health care and a healthy prosperous nation.\" Despite the rhetoric, however, the coalition pays very little attention to proven health methods and promotes a broad spectrum of unscientific approaches. - The World Research Association and various other groups that promote questionable cancer therapies. A few groups promote a mixture of science-based and dubious practices. The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy, for example, promotes the concepts of [clinical ecology](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mcs.html), and the American Academy of Osteopathy espouses [cranial therapy](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/qa/osteo/). Some groups have even set up their own certifying boards. 5. Does it oppose proven public health measures? [Opposition to fluoridation](https://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/fluoride.html) and immunization are tipoffs to extremely poor judgment. The names of such organizations sometimes fail to reveal their true purpose. \"Pure water\" and \"Safe Water\" groups nearly always have dishonest opposition to fluoridation as their central focus. The Preventive Dental Health Association is opposed to the use of [amalgam fillings](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mercury.html) as well as to fluoridation. The World Children's Wellness Foundation is a chiropractic group that opposes the immunization of children. 6. Does it espouse a version of \"freedom of choice\" that would abolish government regulation of the health marketplace? Such \"freedom\" is nothing more than a ploy to persuade legislators to permit the marketing of quack methods without legal restraints. Consumers for Dental Care, for example, has sought an end toward what it calls \"discrimination\" against dentists who advise patients to have their [amalgam](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mercury.html) fillings removed. 7. How is it financed? The Council for Responsible Nutrition, despite its respectable-sounding name, represents manufacturers and distributors of food supplements and other nutritional products. Don't assume, however, that funding by an industry makes an organization unreliable. Reliability should be determined by judging the validity of a group's ideas rather than its funding. The National Dairy Council and the [Institute of Food Technologists](http://ift.micronexx.com/sc/sc_g00.html) are highly respected by the scientific community for their accurate publications on nutrition. The [Partnership for Safe Medicines](http://khn.org/news/non-profit-linked-to-phrma-rolls-out-campaign-to-block-drug-imports/), which opposes importation of drugs from even legitimate Canadian pharmacies, has deep ties to the drug industry's major lobbying group. 8. Is it a real organization? Some entrepreneurs simply make up names for the purpose of marketing products, such as weight-control pills, sex enhancers, or various dietary supplements. \"clinic,\" \"laboratory,\" \"research center,\" or professional-sounding \"association\" uses sensational claims to market products by mail or through the Internet, it is probably a phony. For example, the \" [American Urological Clinic](http://web.archive.org/web/20031206123941/http://www.ago.state.mo.us/51898b.htm),\" which marketed a phony impotence remedy called Vaegra (not Viagra) in 1998, was merely a rented mailbox in Kansas City, Missouri. Scams also exist in which donations are solicited for a phony organization with a name similar to that of a well-known genuine charity. 9. If it is a school, is it accredited by a recognized agency? Accreditation constitutes public recognition that an educational program meets the administrative, organizational, and financial criteria of a recognized agency. In the United States, educational standards for schools are set by a network of agencies approved by the [U.S. Department of Education (USDE](https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/)) or the [Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA](http://www.chea.org)). USOE or CHEA do not accredit individual schools, but they approve the national and regional agencies that do so. Almost all such agencies are voluntary and nongovernmental. Accreditation enables credits to be transferable from one school to another and is used as a basis for entering various professions. In other countries, schools approved by the Minister of Education tend to be reputable. Degrees from entities that are not accredited or approved should not be regarded as equivalent to those from accredited or approved schools. Lack of accreditation of a health-related school should be considered a very bad sign. I have never encountered a nonaccredited school that issued health credentials that did not promote misinformation. Of course, neither accreditation nor affiliation with an otherwise reputable university provides any guarantee of reliability. The U.S. Secretary of Education has recognized agencies that accredit schools of chiropractic, astrology, acupuncture/oriental medicine, massage, and naturopathy with little regard to the validity of what they teach. Moreover, many universities promote health-related nonsense in addition to sound science. Temple University's Center for Frontier Sciences and Columbia University's [Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine](https://www.quackwatch.org/12Web/rosenthal.html) are examples of bad components of basically good institutions. 10. If it awards certifications, how stringent are its requirements? Various types of unscientific practitioners have formed boards through which they certify themselves. In the United States, the recognized standard-setting organization is the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), which recognizes more than 100 specialties and subspecialties. Some medical certifying boards outside of this system have high standards, but most do not. I view the following with considerable distrust. Some are no longer active.

Consumers filed 17 complaints to the AARP Fraud Watch Network last month after being billed thousands of dollars for DNA test kits promoted as providing information about one's risk of developing malignancies. They were solicited largely through telemarketing calls or online ads. Test kits for swabbing the inside of the cheek for DNA were then mailed out but, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, many consumers have reported that they never received test results or were given incomprehensible lab readouts. [Mulcahy N. [One of the biggest healthcare frauds ever is ongoing](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/950461). Medscape, May 4, 2021] Before the pandemic, seniors were typically offered \"free\" cancer genetic tests at health fairs, senior centers, and through telemarketing as part of schemes to defraud: - In April 2019, [AARP reported](https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2019/dna-testing-scam.html)that: (a) the network received 15 reports from consumers who were offered such free tests; (b) several U.S. states issued alerts about scammers using the test offers to steal victims' insurance and personal information in order to be reimbursed by Medicaid or Medicare. - In September 2019, the [the U.S. Office of Inspector General warned the public](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/consumer-alerts/fraud-alert-genetic-testing-scam/)about scammers offering Medicare beneficiaries free screenings or cheek swabs for genetic testing in order to obtain their Medicare information for identity theft or fraudulent billing purposes. \"If Medicare denies the claim, the beneficiary could be responsible for the entire cost of the test, which could be thousands of dollars,\" the warning stated. - By September 2019, the fraud hotline of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services received as many as [50 calls weekly complaining about genetic testing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fraud-genetics-specialreport/special-report-new-frontier-in-health-fraud-genetic-tests-of-the-elderly-idUSKBN1WA2H1). - In September 2019, it was announced that [35 individuals were indicted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-law-enforcement-action-involving-fraudulent-genetic-testing-results-charges-against)for conspiracy to commit health care fraud, conspiracy to pay and receive kickbacks, and health care fraud\u2014they were alleged to have participated in a scheme that fraudulently billed Medicare more than $2.1 billion for medically unnecessary cancer genetic tests.

Ideological bias in \"alternative medicine\" research noted. Dr. Edzard Ernst, who was the first Chair in Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, UK, has reported that acupuncture enthusiast Dr. Adrian White authored 24 acupuncture research publications while working under Ernst's supervision from about 1994 until 2005, none of which had favorable conclusions, Despite this, Dr. Ernst reports, White authored 24 acupuncture research publications since leaving the department, none of which had unfavorable conclusions. [Ernst E. [A longitudinal study of 'ideological' bias in research of 'alternative medicine'](https://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/04/a-longitudinal-study-of-ideological-bias-in-research-of-alternative-medicine/). Skeptical Inquirer, May/June 2021] Dr. Ernst concluded: Of course, this analysis is merely a case study and therefore its findings are not generalizable. However, in my personal experience from twenty-five years of SCAM [so-called alternative medicine] research, the described phenomenon is by no means an exception. On my blog (edzardernst.com), I regularly publish a growing list of SCAM researchers who managed the extraordinary feat of never publishing any negative conclusions about their specific SCAM. I've christened it \"The Alternative Medicine Hall of Fame.\" As of January 2021, the list contains just seventeen names, but is expected to grow steadily. \"Ideological\" conflicts of interest seem to have a more powerful influence in SCAM research than financial ones. As the influence of ideological bias can be so dominant in SCAM, it is important to know about it. Consumers need to be aware when SCAM research originates from unreliable sources, and funders of SCAM research would be wise to stop supporting researchers who are prone to generating findings that are false-positive. In the final analysis, research by hopelessly biased SCAM researchers is worse than no research at all. \"Energy medicine\" paper retracted.

The letter ended with a warning: By preventing mature minors from obtaining vaccinations without parental consent, your state is both hampering its ability to bring COVID-19 (and any future pandemics) under control, as well as violating the fundamental rights of teenagers in the state. To prevent the need to vindicate such rights through litigation, we are hereby requesting that either through legislative action, or through a determination by your office that existing law already requires, that an alternative process to obtaining parental consent through judicial proceedings or a juvenile court or an administrative agency or officer . . . be established whereby mature minors can be vaccinated without parental consent or notification. In absence of such action, CFI will be compelled to bring action on behalf of individuals prevented from being vaccinated and medical professionals prevented from administering those vaccines. It is of paramount importance that as many people are vaccinated as soon as possible.

FTC press release, April 15, 2021] According to its [complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/2023188eneputecomplaint.pdf), the [FTC sent a letter](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_eric_nepute.pdf) in May 2020 warning Nepute about unsubstantiated COVID-19 efficacy claims that he was making for some products. The letter advised him to review all other claims for products he was selling and to stop making claims not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Despite the letter, Nepute continued marketing vitamins and mineral products\u2014specifically, Wellness Warrior vitamin D and zinc\u2014as proven immunity boosters that effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. He also claimed they offered equal or better protection from the disease than currently available vaccines. The FTC alleged that Nepute and Quickwork baselessly or without substantiation claimed: - COVID-19 patients who get enough vitamin D are 52% less likely to die. - People who get enough vitamin D are 77% less likely to get the disease. - Wellness Warrior vitamin D is more effective at preventing the disease than approved vaccines. - Wellness Warrior zinc treats or prevents COVID-19 and it is scientifically proven to work. The FTC is asking the court to: (a) exercise a provision of the new law to impose monetary penalties on Nepute and Quickwork, (b) grant a preliminary injunction against the defendants, (c) bar the defendants from making such health claims unless they are true and can be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence, and (d) bar the defendants from falsely claiming to have scientific evidence about the effects of vitamin D and zinc on COVID-19.

The researchers reported: - In 22 cases, the adverse event was indirect, ranging from mild to life-threatening. - In the indirect adverse-event cases, 16 were due to delay or cessation of a regular diagnosis or treatment, four were due to deficient or extremely restrictive diet, and two were due to an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist. - In cases of indirect harm, the methods used instead of proper care included [bioresonance](https://quackwatch.org/device/reports/a-skeptical-look-at-the-healy-bioresonance-device/), [chiropractic neck reintroduction of gluten, and unknown therapies. - In nine cases, including three infants, there were moderate-to-life-threatening adverse events directly associated with the specific CAM therapy. - All cases involving direct harm followed treatment with supplements, vitamins, manipulation of the neck, or Chinese herbs. - In one case involving [naturopathy](https://quackwatch.org/naturopathy/), the pediatrician had identified a potentially life-threatening situation due to risk of anaphylaxis in a child with a serious food allergy who had been prescribed a supplement that the pediatrician had stopped from being used. Eight cases were deemed to be mild, 12 moderate, eight severe, three life-threatening, and one potentially life-threatening. Five children were hospitalized, including one child with a four-week stay at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. In 18 cases, the pediatricians indicated that the causal relationship between the adverse event and the CAM usage was \"certain,\" in three cases the relation was \"probable,\" in nine cases it was \"possible,\" and in two cases the relation was \"unassessable.\" The researchers suspect that adverse events, especially mild ones, were underreported.

In 2021, he was convicted of a federal felony related to his attempts to promote a misbranded drug as a preventive for COVID-19. For this he was sentenced in 2022 to eight months in federal prison to be followed by one year of supervised release. This article describes these government actions in detail. Wilson's Syndrome For more than 20 years, \"functional hypothyroidism\" has been promoted as \"Wilson's Syndrome,\" a term concocted by [E. Denis Wilson, M.D](../../../01QuackeryRelatedTopics/fad.html#wilson)., who practiced in Florida in the early 1990s. The syndrome's supposed manifestations include fatigue, headaches, PMS, hair loss, irritability, fluid retention, depression, decreased memory, low sex drive, unhealthy nails, easy weight gain, and about 60 other symptoms. Wilson claims to have discovered a type of abnormally low thyroid function in which routine blood tests of thyroid are often normal. He states that the main diagnostic sign is a body temperature that averages below 98.6\u00b0 F (oral), and that the diagnosis is confirmed if the patient responds to treatment with a \"special thyroid hormone treatment.\" [1] In 1992, the Florida Board of Medicine fined Wilson $10,000, suspended his license for six months, and ordered him to undergo psychological testing [2]. Although he does not appear to have resumed practice, his ideas are still promoted by the [Wilson's Syndrome Foundation](http://donotlink.com/www.wilsonssyndrome.com/). Wilson's syndrome is not recognized by the scientific community as a legitimate diagnostic entity. In 1999, the American Thyroid Association issued a strongly worded statement that concluded: - The proposed basis for \"Wilson's syndrome\" is inconsistent with well-known and widely-accepted facts about thyroid hormone production, metabolism, and action. - The diagnostic criteria for \"Wilson's syndrome\"\u2014nonspecific symptoms and body temperature measurement\u2014are imprecise. - There is no scientific evidence that T3 therapy is better than a placebo would be for management of nonspecific symptoms, such as those that have been described as part of \"Wilson's syndrome,\" in individuals with and normal thyroid hormone concentrations, - T3 therapy results in wide fluctuations in T3 concentrations in blood and body tissues. This produces symptoms and cardiovascular complications in some patients, and is potentially dangerous [3]. Note: Although \"Wilson's Syndrome\"\u2014as defined by Dr. Wilson\u2014is a bogus diagnosis, there is a Wilson's disease, a rare condition caused by a defect in the body's ability to metabolize copper. Disciplinary Action in 1998 In 1994, a local newspaper reported that Marschall had learned about \"Wilson's Syndrome\" by studying Wilson's publications and had consulted Wilson by phone. The article said that Marschall was treating more than 200 Wilson's Syndrome patients and that the cost of the initial diagnosis, including the blood test, was $400 [4]. Court documents filed on September 30, 1997, by Washington's Secretary of Health state: - In 1994, Marschall \"met\" Patient A, a California resident, through an online computer service and discussed Patient A's health concerns via the online service. Soon thereafter, Marschall mailed the patient a personal history form, a fee schedule, a patient/physician contract to read and sign, and instructions on how to take her temperatures. After reading Patient A's completed personal history form and temperature log, he diagnosed the patient as suffering from a thyroid problem and determined treatment for that diagnosis in a telephone conversation with the patient. - Marschall never performed a physical examination of Patient A and did not order or perform the standard laboratory tests used for appropriate diagnosis of thyroid malfunction. Despite this, in January 1994, he prescribed a synthetic thyroid hormone (liothyronine) that was mailed to patient A from Bellgrove Pharmacy in Bellevue, Washington. - In 1995, Marschall diagnosed and treated between 75 and 100 long-distance patients for \"functional hypothyroidism\" solely via telephone, online computer services, and/or by mail. He prescribed liothyronine for at least five of them who resided in states other than Washington. - The standard recommended dosage of liothyronine is between 25 and 75 micrograms per day. Marschall prescribed dosages as great as 300 micrograms per day, with about 25% of his \"functional hypothyroidism\" patients receiving doses greater than 200 micrograms per day. Excessive ingestion of liothyronine is hazardous and can result in death. Unprofessional conduct, as defined by Washington's laws and regulations, includes conduct that \"creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed.\" [5] During the proceedings, Marschall claimed that he had based his diagnosis of Patient A on laboratory records obtained from the Kaiser Foundation Hospital/Kaiser Permanente Medical Group. However, Kaiser personnel stated that the records were not requested until 1998, and Patient A stated that she had not signed any release for Marschall to get her records [6]. In 1998, the Washington State Department of Health suspended Marschall's license for 30 months with the provision that he could continue practicing if he did not treat out-of-state patients without physically examining them and treating them in tandem with a health-care professional from the state where the patient resides. He also agreed to pay a $3,000 administrative fine and to permit a Health Department investigator to audit records and review what he was doing twice a year for a two-year period [7]. The proceedings did not address whether \"Wilson's syndrome\" is a genuine entity or whether the factual details in the complaint were accurate. Criminal Prosecution In February 2009, customs agents intercepted a package of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that was addressed to Marschall from India. To be properly labeled, HCG must contain a warning that it has not been demonstrated effective for the treatment of obesity. The FDA then sent Marschall a detention notice which said that the drug was improperly labeled and would be released to him only if he provided a good reason to believe that the product complied with the law. He replied: I am an endocrinologist, a hormone expert. I use Human Chorionic Gonadotropin to treat infertile patients. I require it in 5,000 units ampules most of the time. Some times use 10,000 unit ampules which I can get from American pharmaceutical manufacturers. But American manufacturers do not make 5,000 unit ampules. HCG has only a 60 day shelf life so when I need 5,000 unit ampules to treat over a longer period of time I must purchase them from pharmaceutical manufacturers who make it that way and they happen to be in other countries. I have been in practice 23 years and I have a lot of experience with HCG. The HCG that I get from these suppliers works just as well as the HCG I get from US manufacturers and cost about the same. I hope you will release my shipment soon, I have several patients in need of treatment. If I can answer any other questions you have please email me [8]. The FDA did not release the shipment to Marschall. In July 2009, customs agents detained a similar HCG shipment and sent Marschall another detention notice. Despite these notices, Marschall ordered (and received) illegally manufactured HCG from a compounding pharmacy in Florida\u2014which FDA investigators found by searching the trash picked up at his clinic. In 2010, federal agents searched Marschall's clinic and seized computers, patient files, and dozens of boxes of HCG. During the search, Marschall falsely told FDA official that he prescribed HCG for infertility. However, his Web site stated that he used it for weight-loss. (In fact, in 2009 and 2010, the site claimed that users of his HCG-Slim program would \"lose a pound a day and keep it off for life.\") In 2011, Marschall was charged with one count of causing the introduction of misbranded drugs. [9].Shortly afterward, he entered a guilty plea in which he acknowledged that he had lied to the FDA [10]. The court sentenced him to 2 years supervised release and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,000 fine plus a $100 special assessment. At the sentencing hearing, Marschall told the judge: It is clear to me that I made a mistake by ordering HCG over the Internet. I will say in my defense that HCG is something that has been used in the world since the 1930s, and it has been used for heart disease and rheumatoid problems, prostatic hypertrophy, for immune system disregulation, as well as for weight loss. I have been using it for all those different things. So when my sources in America were unable to provide me\u2014and I contacted every possible compounding pharmacy from California to the East Coast to try to get HCG through my normal channels. I never ordered off of the Internet for any other reason than this. I felt, knowing that it was at least a misdemeanor to do so, that in my belief system, according to the philosophy I was trained under at the University of Santa Clara, you can break a civil law in pursuit of a higher moral law. So in my opinion, in my belief at the time, getting HCG for patients who had benign prostatic hypertrophy, who were struggling with cancer as well as weight problems and an inability to get pregnant and heart disease and several of the conditions that this amazing compound, this natural compound was providing benefit for, if they couldn't supply\u2014if the three American manufacturing suppliers couldn't provide it for me and the Canadians had documented safety evidence for their HCG, which is what they told me and what I was aware of from other sources and other patients who were getting it from the same place, then I did break the law and I did do that. And as soon as\u2014I guess you might say some people would have said to me that you are a victim of your own success, meaning about the 13th clinic that I could ascertain by 2008 to provide HCG for any reason, other than undescended testicles and infertility which the FDA has approved it for. I was training other doctors around\u2014some of my fellow naturopathic doctors who are endocrinology trained in our own way. They started ordering, and we couldn't get it domestically, so in fact we got it this way, not just myself, but as many Americans do, when they can't get their own pharmaceutical drugs that they either can't get or afford, they do it through that way. I was looking for another source and within just several months, it came available in Florida. And at the time the FDA actually took my HCG, they took domestic HCG from my clinic, a thousand dollars worth which they never returned, and it only has a shelf life of six months, so that's the case. I guess if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have done it. It was a mistake. Look what it has gotten me into here. Even with the benefit of these patients, I broke the law. So I don't intend to ever do that again, ever [11]. Further Government Actions In 2012, following his conviction, the Washington Department of Health (DOH) charged Marschall with unprofessional conduct [12 ]. The charges included (a) improperly representing himself as a \"bariatric endocrinologist\" and (b) being convicted for trafficking in human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which he was illegally prescribing as a weight loss drug. The charges were settled with an agreed order under which: - Marschall admitted that between 2008 and 2010, he prescribed HCG to approximately 170 patients who lived outside of Washington State and had never seen him in person. - The DOH fined him $10,000, suspended his license for at least one year, ordered him to take continuing education courses in ethics, endocrinology, and obesity. - Marschall was ordered to remove references to HCG from his Web site and indicate that all new patients must be examined during their initial visit. - If his license is reinstated, he must serve seven years on probation with semi-annual record audits for one year and annual audits for four years [13]. In 2014, while his license was under suspension, the board learned that Marschall was still holding himself out as a practicing naturopath, soliciting patients, and prescribing drugs. In fact, pages on archive.org indicate that he continuously advertised naturopathic services at his Natural Healing Clinic until at least the end of 2014 [14]. In September 2015, he signed an agreed order that required him to pay a $5,000 fine and permanently cease and desist from practicing naturopathy in the State of Washington without a requisite health credential [15]. However, he continued doing business as \"Rick Marschall, N.D.\" at his Natural Healing Clinic. The clinic Web site stated: After 31 years I have retired from prescriptive practice. I have let go of my license to practice medicine or naturopathic medicine in the State of Washington and I am not licensed to prescribe prescription drugs in the State of Washington or plan to do so anywhere else. I have learned how to help people with significant health challenges in a more effective, sustainable and inexpensive way without the need for drugs for most issues. Read on and then call me at no charge to discuss whether this diet and lifestyle change is of interest to you [16]. The treatments mentioned on his site included \"nutritional counseling,\" \"sex hormone balancing,\" \"constitutional homeopathic energy medicine,\" investigators found that he was still prescribing HCG to patients. In 2017, Marschall pleaded guilty to introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and was fined $2.000 and sentenced to two months in prison to be followed by one year of supervised release. Documents in the case state: - Between February 2014 and February 2017, Marschall prescribed HCG to about 60 individuals for weight loss. - Marschall obtained the HGH from various compounding pharmacies by lying about the states of his license and DEA registration number. - In September 2016, two Washington Department of Health investigators went undercover as patients and listened as Marschall touted HCG for weight-loss and described how he would set up a program of injections for them. - Later that fall, Marschall communicated via email with an undercover FDA criminal investigator, conducted a one-hour telephone screening, and, without meeting or examining the patients, mailed HCG to her at a cost of $550 for a one-month supply [17,18]. In 2018, Marschall signed an agreed order under which Marschall admitted that he had been practicing naturopathy illegally since 2013. The order also \"permanently enjoined from the practice of naturopathic medicine, and from representing himself as a naturopathic physician or using the initials 'ND', the title 'doctor' or 'naturopath', or any other similar title, without the requisite health care credential [19]. However, he continued to market himself himself a \"health coach\" and \"retired\" naturopath. In March 2020, FDA criminal investigators began reviewing complaints from the public about postings on In October 2021, following a 4-day trial, Marshall was convicted for the third time of distributing misbranded products [21]. In March 2022, Marschall was sentenced top eight months in prison plus one year of supervised release. In asking for a prison sentence, the prosecutors wrote to the court: For decades, Marschall lied and broke the law to provide unapproved treatments and healthcare services. Marschall lied to patients. He lied to authorities. He treated patients without examining them. And he prescribed substances in unusually large doses. Marschall repeated that dangerous playbook in this case: lying to the undercover agent about his credentials, treating her and her children over the phone without a physical exam, and recommending an extremely high dose of his drug.\" [22] References - Wilson ED.

NATUROTHERAPIST TOLD DIABETIC TO STOP INSULIN From the sad but true department: Louise Lortie, a \"naturotherapist,\" was sentenced by a judge in Hull, Quebec to three years in prison for the death of a 12-year-old diabetic girl. The judge found Lortie guilty of criminal neglect after she recommended that her patient rely on a combination of salt baths and herbal remedies instead of insulin to treat her diabetes. Three days later the Lisanne Manseau girl died in a diabetic coma. Crown prosecutor Martin Cote noted in an interview outside the courtroom, \"The message that had to be sent to the community had to be clear and, as I told the judge, when you have someone who has access to the media and who indicates that she's not responsible for her actions, that it's someone else's fault, it's important that the judge takes that into consideration and sends a very loud and clear message that that's not to be repeated.\" [Christopher Guly, The Ottawa Citizen, c.February, 2000] RISKS TO SURGICAL PATIENTS USING ALT-COMP MEDICINES Carol Norred, a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), researcher and PhD candidate at the UCHSC Department of Anesthesiology and School of Nursing, recently published a study in the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) stating that patients who use complementary and alternative medicines within two weeks of surgery may experience adverse side effects. The study, titled \"Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicines by Surgical Patients,\" appears in the February issue of the AANA Journal. She studied 500 patients having elective surgery and found evidence of likely side effects from the use of unconventional medicines taken up to two weeks before surgery. The study goes on to categorize complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) according to potential \"adverse effects\" with drugs used during surgery. The study concluded that some supplements can increase bleeding and prolong coagulation time during surgery. These include alfalfa, chamomile, some Chinese herbs, garlic, ginkgo, kava, licorice, vitamin E and fish oil. Supplements such as Black Cohosh, used to treat menopause, menstrual cramps and osteoporosis, tend to lower a patient's blood pressure during surgery. Conversely St. John's Wort, used to control depression, was found to raise blood pressure as well as cause confusion, agitation and drowsiness in surgical patients. Norred believes that more scientific research is needed to safely integrate CAM into the management of surgical patients. As always, an \"open dialogue between patients and providers can prevent complications related to the use of unconventional medicines.\" The AANA advises full disclosure of herb, vitamin supplement use before any surgical operation. [Park Ridge, IL, BW HealthWire, 3/14/00 via NewsEdge 10-year-old girl suffocated during a \"rebirthing\" process. Candace Newmaker of North Carolina, was wrapped tightly in a blanket and pillows to simulate a womb. Therapists would push on the \"womb\" to simulate uterine contractions. Candace, an adopted child, had not bonded with her parents-a condition termed \"attachment disorder.\" Therapists theorize that re-enacting the birth experience may enable the patient to relive early developmental phases that were missed. A video tape of the session revealed that the girl told her therapists seven times that she could not breathe. The therapists urged her to push her way out of the blanket through a twisted end. Therapists Brita St. Clair, Jack McDaniel, and Julie Ponder, all employees at Connell Watkins and Associates counselling office, which specializes in \"attachment therapy, in Evergreen, Colorado were arrested and charged with \"child abuse resulting in death.\" The charge carries a 16-year minimum mandatory sentence, and a maximum 48 years in prison. Watkins has been ordered to discontinue rebirthing in her practice. [Reuters, 5/18/00; and 5/23/00] NORTH AMERICAN GINSENG LOSING POPULARITY Chai-Na-Ta Corp, the world's largest producer of North American ginseng, filed for creditors' protection under the federal Companies Creditors Arrangement Act in the British Columbia Supreme Court. It seems the market prices for North American ginseng has fallen drastically in recent years. As recently as 1996, the suburban Langley, BC-based firm was among the Toronto Stock Exchange's Composite Index 300. But it has fallen on tough financial times as the international price for ginseng root plummeted in recent years. According to Chai-Na-Ta president Gerry Gill, the entire industry is under pressure as prices continue to decline. \"Market prices for North American ginseng continue to be depressed, putting the entire industry under pressure,\" Chai-Na-Ta's stock price on the TSE hit close to $26 in March 1994. However, on November 12, 1999, the stock closed at 27 cents. The company has been trying to refinance its debt with it's principle lenders. Gill believes that market conditions will improve as the ginseng supply declines. Currently, 99% of Chai-Na-Ta's ginseng harvest is exported through Hong Kong to China and southeast Asia. It's widely used there for its medicinal qualities. According to Gill, Chai-Na-Ta expects to present its restructuring proposal to creditors in the next 30 days. [Wyng Chow Vancouver (CP) 11/13/99] LINK BETWEEN FAITH AND HEALING Does deep religious faith help the healing process? A number of recent studies seem to point in that direction. This seems especially true with the increasing popularity of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age beliefs, and alternative medicine. So is there really a link between spirituality and the healing process? But a couple of studies coming out of Columbia University suggest otherwise. Dr. Richard Sloan and colleagues at Columbia University in New York City contend that the link spirituality, and health is \" weak and inconsistent\". After all, common sense tells us that people of faith tend to lead healthier lives, i.e. non-use of tobacco and alcohol products. Sloan goes on to say,\" Avoidance of these risks may influence their overall health to a much greater extent than simple religious belief. Their review appears in the February 20 issue of The Lancet. Although the Columbia University team also produced a study that found regular churchgoers did indeed have a lower risk of illness and death than non- churchgoers, they reported a flaw in their own study, i.e the fact that ill health may prevent many individuals from attending church in the first place. Based on that, the Columbia University team concludes \"doctors should remain cautious when 'recommending' faith as a possible aid to physical recovery\".. While a link between faith and healing remains unproved, \"respectful attention must be paid to the impact of religion on the patient's decisions about health care,\" they conclude.

[Columbia, SC, 2/17/00, PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation] NEVADA HOMEOPATHS SCRAP RETRY AT EXPANDING SCOPE OF PRACTICE Another short chapter has been written in the saga of one state's flirtation and struggle with quackery. First, some background information. In 1983, the influence of a powerful state political leader led to the establishment of a Homeopathic medical licensing board in Nevada. The state quickly became a magnet for troubled and delicensed medical renegades who practiced a grab-bag of quackery. Most popular were galvanic devices used as part of so-called \"energy medicine.\" The \"energy\" was alleged to be of the cosmic, metaphysical kind dubbed chi, prana, vital energy, and the like, by healing systems rooted in ancient superstitions. Few, if any, of the licensees were actually practicing traditional homeopathy. It was an incredible situation in which a fake system (homeopathy) was being faked, so that consumers could be exploited with another fake system (energy medicine). The devices are boons to quackery because they enable practitioners to create the illusion of diagnosing, treating or prescribing for phantom diseases. This places them in full control of the clinical situation. It also provides a defense against other physicians who testify as medical experts because they know nothing of these allegedly specialized devices which influences juries to favor the innovative defendant. In 1987, the legislature became aware that it had been snookered by the energy medicine merchants. The result was a new homeopathic practice act that specifically limited licensees to the homeopathic substances prepared according to the \"methods of Hahnemannian dilutions and succussion, magnetically energized geometric pattern as defined in the official homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States.\" Wow! what language. This was a classic example of the institutionalization of pseudomedical gibberish by scientifically illiterate lawmakers! Well, the medical renegades didn't like it much either, and have plotted to undo the limitations of the practice act ever since. The most recent attempt was to expand its licensee's scope of practice by instituting its own new regulations to include virtually any type of alternative medicine as long as patients consented. However, opposition by the Nevada State Medical Association and the Board of Medical Examiners, plus the vow by Reno pathologist W.J. Diamond to sue the homeopathic board if it adopted its self-imposed practice expansion, caused homeopathic board chairman, Dr. Fuller Royal, to drop the proposal. [Las Vegas Review-Journal. 4/30/00] Comment. Royal refers to the resistance of standard medicine to the expanded scope as \"a turf war,\" and vows to try again in the future. Of course, it isn't a true turf war in which equivalently competent practitioners are competing for the privilege of delivering legitimate health services. This is an issue of the legalization of buccaneer medical entrepreneurialism versus accountable evidence-based medicine, with consumers caught in the middle. The lesson to be learned here is that opposition by standard medicine can still be an effective way to thwart the advancement of quackery. Too many in leadership positions have given up fighting for the tenets of professionalism and consumer protection. CHIROPRACTIC CLINICS RAIDED Officers looking for information on past patient accounts seized 9 computers from the Sacramento billing office of the chiropractic offices of a chain known previously as the California Back & Neck Pain Specialists. Charges include false billing and workers' comp fraud.

Elder has renamed the business America's Back & Neck Pain Specialists. [Sacramento Bee, 11/13/99] ACUPUNCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EVENTS Sometimes it may work, and it seems harmless enough, so why not try acupuncture for what ails you. While admitting that the procedure is usually harmless, researchers Vickers and Zollman, found that, when a systemic infection does occur, it can be devastating. In a published review of acupuncture, the single reported fatality from acupuncture was due to streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. The case involved a 41-year-old man receiving acupuncture for shoulder pain. He collapsed three days later with the skin of his shoulder succumbing to a rapidly spreading erythematous and necrotic condition. Despite immediate extensive antibiotic treatment, he died within twenty-four hours. Although life threatening complications involving acupuncture is rare, the literature reports 11 such cases in 1998. Although several other cases of infection that were severe enough to require intensive treatment were also found, there were frequent delays in accurate diagnosis because patients were hesitant to tell their doctors they had tried the procedure. Two cases of angina from electroacupuncture have been reported. Both cases were confirmed when symptoms recurred during re-exposure. This is the first such finding. The survey concluded that acupuncture does occasionally have serious adverse events and even the rare fatality. Most of these outcomes were negligence related. It should be obvious that all concerned with setting standards, delivering training and maintaining competence in acupuncture be familiar with the lessons taught by these events. [BMJ 19 February 2000;320:513] ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF BOTANICAL PREPARATIONS The passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) stimulated 5 years of unprecedented growth of the herbal and nutritional supplement industry. While it seems growth is slowing, US consumers are using increasing amounts of herbal and nutritional products, along with, or instead of conventional medicine. Physicians and pharmacists seek answers to consumer questions out of concern about the safety and efficacy of these substances. In trying to answer these questions, authors McDermott and Motyka take a look at issues in regard to product quality and standardization of the botanical preparations, and present an outline of issues for healthcare professionals to consider when making recommendations regarding botanical products. They begin by defining the problem as it exists since the passage of DSHEA, the act that allowed the large array of herbal and nutritional supplements to enter the marketplace. As is well known, these products are produced and marketed outside the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is up to manufacturers to ensure the safety of supplements. Authors state that problems related to the quality of herbal supplements can be found throughout the lay and professional literature. They place reports into four categories: intentional addition of an active drug causing for therapeutic or adverse effects; unintentional substitution of the herbal with a toxic species; environmental contamination of the herb with a chemical or pathogen; and suboptimal or varying amounts of active ingredient within a formulation. They go on to give specific examples of each category as found in the literature. [Medscape, 2000, Inc] HUMANA TO SETTLE ALLEGED DECEPTION FOR $800,000 Here's one for the citizens of Florida. Due to deceptive practices Humana Health Plan Inc. will refund a total of $800,000 to about 2,100 Florida Medicare beneficiaries. It seems they were allegedly enticed to join the plan with a deceptive hearing aid offer. According to Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Humana admitted no wrong doing but agreed to revise its marketing practices. According to Butterworth, Humana promised consumers who joined its Gold Plus Plan a free set of hearing aids or a $700 discount on more expensive models. But members who opted for the high-end models paid a higher base price for them than people not covered by the plan, offsetting the so-called discount, he explained. \"Such practices are reprehensible under any circumstance, but the fact that many of the victims were elderly people on fixed incomes makes them even more so,\" Butterworth said. Members who chose the more expensive hearing aids will be refunded the amount they were overcharged. [Reuters Health, 2/17/2000] RESEARCHERS FIND LESS GRAY MATTER IN SOCIOPATHS According to a report in Archives of General Psychiatry researchers have found the first evidence that people suffering from antisocial personality disorder (APD) have less gray matter in the front part of their brains than healthy people. Gray matter is the thinking part of the brain. Researchers caution, however, less gray matter isn't the only factor in the making of a sociopath. Societal factors such as drug or alcohol abuse, as well as upbringing also contribute to the problem. Other physical traits like high levels of the male hormone testosterone, birth complications or a breakdown in other parts of the brain can all contribute to antisocial behavior.In collecting data researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the prefrontal cortex gray and white matter of 21 men with APD. Then they compared the measurements to 34 healthy men and 26 men who had abused drugs. Findings revealed that the volume of gray matter was 11% less in the sociopaths when compared to healthy men. For more information on antisocial personality disorder, see Internet Mental Health or Columbia University's Internet site. [HealthSCOUT, 2/15/00] MAN TRIED FOR MURDER WHEN 'CURES' WENT WRONG Portugal's Lusa news agency reported that Manuel Dinis Pimentel, a Portuguese man, went on trial in Portugal's Azores Islands charged with murdering eight people. The prosecutors said the eight had died over a two week period, in summer 1998, after Pimentel applied a solution containing pesticides to their skin. He claimed to have his own cancer cures as well as cures for other serious diseases. Pimentel, who had been treating patients with his own remedies for 20 years on the far-flung Azores islands of Pico, Faial and Sao Jorge, was also charged with 21 cases of attempted murder and 21 cases of fraud. Pimentel, who faces 25 years in jail if found guilty, denies murder and says the people died because they failed to tell him they were also suffering from other illnesses, such as diabetes. [Lisbon, Reuters, 2/23/00] CONGRESS OKAYS HALF-TRUTHS (LIES) AS HEALTH CLAIMS There is no such thing as a \"half-truth.\" Something is either true or untrue. Granted, the term \"misleading\" is used for the clever lies hucksters use to label and advertise their wares, but such are ultimately judged to be false. Your and my representatives have again showed us where their hearts are. As if it weren't enough for dietary supplements hucksters to be given free reign as to what they may bottle and sell, now they may legally make misleading claims as to the value of their nostrums. Section 201.(g)(2) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act defines a drug as: articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or any other animals. This sensible, scientifically accurate definition has been dismembered by the shyster lawyers now serving as legislators in our congress. Hucksters may not mention specific diseases in their marketing claims, but they are permitted to pretend to alter the structure and function of the body-something that is factually inseparable from diseases and disorders. For instance, the quacks cannot say that their pills and potions treat or cure arthritis, but they may say \"helps support healthy joints.\" They cannot say that the dietary supplement prevents, treats or cures \"heart disease,\" but they can say that it \"keeps your arteries clean,\" or \"... from being narrowed.\" They cannot mention Alzheimer's disease but can say that a supplement \"helps mental functioning or memory.\" Consumers clearly cannot distinguish between these carefully-worded phrases. Comment. If members of Congress don't understand this they are stupid. If they realize how deceptive this is but do it anyway they are crooks. In either case, they are unqualified to be public representatives. The media should be screaming about this travesty. Is the money they earn by advertising dietary supplements sealing their lips, or do they too hold strong beliefs about the power of special foods, herbs, and vitamins to prevent disease and produce a kind of superhealth?

Volume 19, Issue #6 COLLOIDAL SILVER PRODUCTS WIDELY CONDEMNED Colloidal silver is being huckstered as a superior germ fighter by a number of promoters, including the wacky naturopath-veterinarian Joel Wallach. NCAHF reported that a permanent skin discoloration known as argyria can result from ingesting too much silver. Now, even the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) is warning health food dealers and consumers that colloidal silver products have not been proved either safe or effective (NNFA Today, Oct, 1996). Of this, NCAHF president William Jarvis says, \"Pinch me, I must be dreaming!\" Since when does the NNFA worry about unproved safety or efficacy? NNFA was a driving force behind the passage of the Hatch Bill forbidding the FDA from regulating dietary supplements on the basis of safety or efficacy. Most NNFA members live off of the selling of health products that are unproved. \"Let's hope that this new-found concern over public health and safety extends itself to other health food products,\" Jarvis says. In addition to the NNFA criticism, a consumer named Rosemary Jacobs of Derby Line, Vermont, has filed a citizen's petition with the FDA asking that all orally-administered products containing colloidal silver be required to carry a warning label. Jacobs asked the FDA to consider banning all ingestible products containing silver unless the manufacturers can prove that they are effective. (Food Chemical News, 10/14/96) YAM PRODUCTS Taking hormone supplements is a current fad. People are ingesting melatonin, DHEA, human growth hormone, testosterone, etc, with a startling lack of fear. Among the popular items on the growing list are Mexican yam supplements that are alleged to become the building blocks for DHEA or progesterone. By way of background, in the not-too-distant past the main source of steroid hormones was animal glands. This was not efficient because the amounts were very small-it took 625 kg of ovaries from 50,000 sows to produce 20 mg of pure crystalline progesterone. In 1943, it was found that Mexican yams (Dioscorea species) were rich in steroidal sapogenins that could be converted to progesterone. This hormone and the process used to prepare it were the foundation stones of the Syntex Company (Pharmacognosy, 1988, p.175). Mexican yam became the principle raw material from which birth control pills (ie, \"the pill\") are made. Now the health food industry is peddling Mexican yam supplements as a \"natural\" way for women to avoid post menopausal estrogen therapy, and for others to provide their bodies with the building blocks of DHEA. People do not stop to think that any substance that actually has a hormonal effect upon the body is potentially dangerous and must be carefully monitored. The difference is that the legitimate drug companies are fulfilling their duty to warn users of their products of potential adverse effects while the health food promoters are not. Worse, they make \"natural\" seem to be synonymous with \"safe\" when it is not. Now comes a report from Aeron LifeCycles Laboratory which says that Mexican yam-containing products do not contain, nor act as precursors to, progesterone, progestin, or DHEA. (Townsend Letter, 10/96, p.104) This is good news on the safety front, but still leaves users as victims of another dietary supplement hoax. NEBRASKA OUTLAWS EPHEDRA DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS In July, the Nebraska State Legislature enacted a law that categorizes products containing ephedra as prescription only. Exempted are FDA-approved over-the-counter products. The Nebraska law is a reaction to the irresponsible 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act (DSHEA) which stripped consumers of protection from hazardous dietary supplements. It only deals with one dangerous substance being hawked by the health food industry, but it shows how states can undo the folly of bad laws passed by Congress. Obviously, what is needed is a total repeal of the DSHEA, but with the industry willing to throw big money at our lawmakers, the chance of getting the right thing done is slim. The industry is reported to have given $2.5 million to lawmakers \"to get its message across.\" GNC REMOVES EPHEDRINE PRODUCTS General Nutrition Centers has removed products containing ephedrine from its 2,700 stores due to the bad publicity the substance has been receiving in the press, which had led to a 20% drop in the value of GNC stock. Ephedra products make up about 6% of GNC's business. GNC is asking its manufacturers to reformulate products. Although a company spokesman declared that GNC was \"erring on the side of safety by removing ephedrine,\" NCAHF suspects that the fact that several states have banned ephedrine products following many deaths that have been linked to the substance is a major factor in GNC's decision. As a national chain it is important to have standard products that can be marketed in all states. (FDA Hotline, October, 1996) Comment: In some products ephedrine is being replaced with phenylalanine. According to Graedon's Best Medicine, (Bantam, 1991) \"There may be a risk of hypertension with l-phenylalanine, so this amino acid should not be taken unless under a physician's supervision.\" Graedon says that l-phenylalanine also carries a possible risk of malignant melanoma, which is no small matter to sun-loving health enthusiasts who make up an important segment of consumers of such products. Many products continue to contain caffeine in substantially higher doses than a cup of coffee. CHIROPRACTIC CENTER AT NIH On September 30, President Clinton signed into law the 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act which includes nearly $1 million for the continuation of the \"chiropractic demonstration grants program.\" Under the 4-year-old program, chiropractic colleges conduct collaborative demonstration projects with DCs and MDs working together to diagnose and treat spinal and lower back conditions. The bill also establishes a Chiropractic Center within the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. The primary political support for these developments came from Senators Arlen Spector (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA). Both states have chiropractic colleges. (Dynamic Chiropractic, 11/18/96) Comment: Up to now chiropractic had been largely left out of the discussion on \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine at NIH. Having a designated center now catapults it ahead of some of the other guilds. This is an important, and possibly constructive development. The American Medical Associations 1997 edition of Physician's Current Procedural Terminology now includes an identification code for \"chiropractic manipulative treatment\" to \"influence joint and neurophysiological function.\" Although some may view this development as another example of the degradation of evidence-based medicine, there is some reason for optimism. The more association chiropractic has with standard health care, the more limited it becomes in its scope of practice. Chiropractic's future lies in treating low back pain, less neck rotation (because of the unjustifiable risk/benefit ratio), and an abandonment of the subluxation concept. In isolation, chiropractic got crazier. In association with standard medicine, it will become more sound. PATIENTS CAN HELP DETECT HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD Fraudulent pharmacy practices, such as short counting prescriptions, can steal millions from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance companies. Patients should count the number of pills in a bottle carefully to be sure they are getting the prescribed amount. If a pharmacy does not provide the full prescription and asks you to return for the remainder, be sure to do it and check the count. Always ask your doctor for the total number of pills being prescribed and match it with the number from the pharmacy. If the prescription is marked for refills, be sure to get them when the time is due. Ointments and creams should be checked for size. For example, the patient may receive a 15 g tube while the company is billed for a larger size. Medicaid and Medicare are said to be the most vulnerable to such fraudulent practices. This is the type of fraud that is least likely to attract attention of the anti-fraud agencies. It is small time stuff to them but costs the nation many millions. Only alert consumers can police such practices. RAND FINDS LITTLE JUSTIFICATION FOR NECK MANIPULATION The Rand Corporation conducted a review of the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine employing the same technique it had used to evaluate spinal manipulative therapy for back pain. A panel of nine judges (4 DCs, 4 MDs, and 1 MD/DC) rated cervical manipulation for appropriateness for specified clinical conditions. Each scenario was rated twice-once individually, and then again after a group discussion. A scale of 1 to 9 was used to judge appropriateness based upon the evaluator's opinion of its benefit-risk ratio. Only 11.1% of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriate. The most important finding was the paucity of evidence for the benefit of these procedures. The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. Estimates of risk run from as low as 1 in 40,000 manipulations for mild complications, to 1 in one million for serious complications. [Coulter, et al. The Appropriateness of Manipulation and Mobilization of the Cervical Spine. Santa Monica, CA, Rand Corp, 1996] Comment: Although the report discussed the differences between mobilization and manipulation (the latter is more forceful with extension and rotation), there was insufficient attention paid to differences in the risks of these procedures. NCAHF contends that, since neck stiffness and/or soreness are self-limited, and that there is no important medical benefit to neck manipulation, any risk of stroke or paralysis-no matter how small-is unacceptable. Even if the risk is 1 in one million, the thought of 50,000 chiros nationwide doing 20 to 40 manipulations each working day presents the nightmare of 1-2 patients a day experiencing completely avoidable strokes or paralysis. Given the history of chiropractic silence on its shortcomings, and an ideology that teaches that everyone will benefit from having his or her neck \"cracked,\" NCAHF can only repeat its strong warning against neck manipulation. KENNEY PICKS A BONE WITH THE ZONE The TV tabloid shows are gushing about the latest food fad in Hollywood: going for \"the zone\" as promoted in the book by the same title written by Barry Sears, PhD (biochemistry, Indiana University). \"The zone,\" Dr. Sears claims, is a \"nearly euphoric metabolic state\" in which athletes perform their best, those with weight problems lose their bulk, and all will reduce their risks of serious diseases. Sears recommends a 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 30% protein diet to live in the zone. Sears contends that the high complex carbohydrate, low fat diets recommended by Pritikin and Ornish, are dangerous. This has prompted NCAHF vice president, James Kenney, PhD (Rutgers), a nutritionist at the Pritikin Longevity Center, to respond in detail. Lest readers accuse Kenney of financial conflict of interest, please bear in mind that Sears not only is selling his book but also has a line of BioZone snack bars that will cost users about $40 per week if they follow the \"Spartacus Quick Start Plan.\" Kenney's critique fills the entire 8 pages of the Sept-Oct Nutrition & Health Forum (formerly Nutrition Forum). Bonnie Liebman didn't like The Zone either. Her 3-page critique appeared in the July-August, 1996 issue of Nutrition Action. Both give credit and criticism alike on similar points, but for dietitians and nutritionists who want the details, Kenney's critique has 56 references. CHROMIUM PICOLINATE PROMOTERS SETTLE FTC FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGES The Federal Trade Commission announced settlements with three California companies charged with making unsupported claims about weight loss and health benefits for chromium picolinate. The companies, Nutrition 21, Body Gold, and Universal Merchants, were unable to provide solid scientific evidence to back their claims. [FTC News Notes, 11/4/96] CAN STANDARD MEDICINE EMPLOY \"ALTERNATIVE\" & \"COMPLEMENTARY\" MEDICINE WITHOUT LIABILITY? Trial lawyers should be licking their chops as naive hospital administrators rush to market alternative medicine because it is a fad. The reason is that when things go badly standard medicine cannot be protected from legal liability in the same way nonstandard practitioners have in the past. An investigation of why the attorneys who have managed to make a good living off of medical malpractice cases haven't been able to make a dent in the problem of quackery uncovered some important reasons why patients this is so. Deep Pockets Lawyers pursue \"deep pockets,\" and off-beat practitioners avoid looking like good target. Many do not carry insurance, a fact that they inform patients about by posting signs in their offices (patients are not always warned but find out after the fact). In a sad case in which a woman was paralyzed from the neck down by a chiropractor, she found that he had no insurance whatever because he had crippled 2 others and could not buy insurance. Most of his assets were in his wife's name, and his worth was only about $50,000. No attorney was willing to do all of the necessary work for such a paltry collectible award. Differing standards of conduct Acupuncturists, chiropractors, naturopaths, etc, do not practice medicine; therefore, they cannot be held to medical standards. Case: An Oregon woman fell on her tail bone. She went to a chiropractor instead of a physician. He x-rayed her back, but didn't see the fracture. After some time, she developed chronic, severe back pain. A physician found that the failure to immobilize her fractured vertebra had caused bone spurs to develop. She sued but lost because, in the eyes of the law she had gotten what she had paid for-she had chosen the chiropractor \"at her own risk.\" Other chiropractors had testified that he had followed standard practice for chiropractors. This defense won't work when it can be shown that patients believed that they were chosing medicine, and that the provider knew-or ought to have known-that the safety of the \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" procedure was unproven which is inherent in the definitions of such procedures. Primum non nocere (\"above all, do no harm\") is the oldest consumer protection principle in history. Culpability For Referrals Even if patients are referred out, medical doctors or clinics referring patients to nonstandard practitioners carry a degree of responsibility if things go badly. Administrators should be alert to the fact that nonstandard practitioners generally employ a kind of \"heads I win, tails they lose\" psychology. When things go well they take the credit, but when things go badly they blame standard medicine. Alternative practitioners have traditionally substituted patient satisfaction for true clinical effectiveness. Their ability to convert patients to their way of thinking generally puts the patient on the side of the alternative practitioner when disputes arise. Barnum wisely advised, \"Never try to beat a man at his own game.\" A MOTHERING GROUND OF QUACKERY William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. During 25 years of studying quackery, I have been struck by the high proportion of major types of quackery that originated in a relatively small region of western Europe. Herbalisma, magnetic Gerson cancer therapyk, to name a few. I believe that the European tradition of alchemy which was embodied in the German alchemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), seeker of medical remedies, is significant. Paracelsus, who was extreme in both mysticism and intelligent observation, is an icon who has inspired a devoted following of medical cranks and influential lay persons-among them Prince Charles [1]. Although already familiar with Paracelsus from my study of medical history, I had the opportunity to read Paracelsus's writings first hand while a witness in a case involving the starvation death of a 17-month-old Canadian child. The Germany-reared herbalist responsible for the tragedy was so devoted to Paracelsus that he had translated his books into English and used them as his source of authority. Medical historians give Paracelsus some credit for his views, but most of what he taught is very weird by any standard. Skrabanek said that \"Paracelsianism is fundamental to the credibility of holistic medicine, and that it is no coincidence that Paracelsus was resurrected by Nazi leaders in their promulgation of naturopathy.\" [1] Naturopathy began in the 19th century German water cure spas, and Germans today are said to be \"by far the world's leading spa-goers\" with more than 6 million going on a \"cure\" each year [2]. In Germany, 7 out of 10 general practitioners practice alternative medicine [3]. A dozen off-beat clinics in the region promote unproven cancer cures-most are in Germany. Use of unproven cancer remedies in the region are the highest ever reported: Germany (65.7%), Austria (59%), and Switzerland (52% & 70%). [4] Many of these bogus cancer remedies are available at Mexico border clinics. A large homeopathic medicine industry thrives in Europe-90,000 of the 126,000 medicines on the market in Germany are \"homeopathic and natural medicines.\" [5] The European Common (EC) Market situation forced pharmacists there to face up to the reality that homeopathy is a delusion. Even after a debate that acknowledged homeopathy's absurdities, pharmacists voted to continue selling irrational homeopathic remedies. Despite its name, the EC's European Medicines Evaluation Agency does not evaluate medicines but merely coordinates the evaluations of drugs made by EC member states [6]. Alderidge provides a description of nonstandard medicine in specific European countries [7]. It's not a pretty picture for those who believe in evidence-based medicine. The next time someone tells you about medicines that are available in Europe that our hard-nosed FDA won't allow into this country-remember its legacy of quackery. Citations.

Thus, an herb that resembles an organ or malady is useful in its cure.

One hundred years later a magnetic healer named Daniel Palmer invented chiropractic. (c) While living in Austria in 1790, German physician Franz Josef Gall (1757-1828), theorized that the shape of one's skull was a map that revealed personality. He and his pupil, Johann Sebastian Spurzheim (1776-1832) formulated phrenology in four treatises (1810-19). It has disappeared, but its kin, physiogamy (character is revealed in the shape of the face) is still alive. (d) In 1810, German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who earned a living translating classical works into German because he had become disillusioned by his inability to cure his patients, discovered the same primitive idea of correspondences that inspired Paracelsus. (e) Aromatherapy has its roots in the ancient miasmic theory-foul odors cause disease (eg, mal-airia = \"bad air\" fever) which also gave rise to the French perfume industry-Lemery's Pharmacopee universelle (1697) was used for years as an authoritative source of remedies. (f) Traced to Bavarian Father Sebastian Kneipp's cold water treatment. In 1902, German \"Dr.\" Benedict Lust (1872-1945) purchased the term \"naturopath,\" formed the Naturopathic Society of America.

His quest for the biological roots of the libido theory led him to formulate his orgone theory. Reich built The Orgone Energy Accumulator to treat diseases by absorbing \"blue bions\" or \"Cosmic Orgone Energy.\" The American College of Orgonomy uses and promotes Reich's methods.

Niehans used a special flock of sheep as donor animals because he believed they did not get cancer.

NEW BOOK ON MAGNETISM PROVIDES TOOLS FOR DEBUNKING VITALISM Belief in vitalism, \"the doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\" (Webster's Dictionary); or, \"the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force; opposed to mechanism\" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary) provides the conceptual underpinnings that sustains the perpetual plague of quackery. Vitalistic of the \"physicochemical forces\" despised by vitalists embraces the physics of magnetism, an understanding of which is key to debunking vitalistic psychobabble. Dr. James Livingston makes the physics of magnetism clear in his marvelous book, Driving Force (Harvard, 1996). Livingston writes in a delightfully readable style. Readers will not only learn marvelous facts about lodestones, how the earth generates its own electromagnetic field, and the role of magnetism in nearly every modern technology, but they will also see how pseudosciences have exploited the mystery of magnetism for their purposes. Livingston provides useful information on how magnets are used to deceive people for entertainment by magicians, and how these same tricks have been used by phoney psychics, such as Uri Geller, to deceive the public. Kusche wisely stated that the less a person knows about a subject, the easier it is to make it into a mystery, in his debunking of the Bermuda Triangle myth (The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, Warner, 1975). Livingston explains the lack of science and the appropriate skepticism that should be applied to magnet products that claim to treat pain and disease. Nikken, Oriental Medical Supplies, and other companies are discussed with the caveat that none of these products have proven value for anything medical. This is contrasted with understandable explanations about how the medical marvels like Magnetic Resonance Imagery, positron emission tomography, and computerized taxial tomography work. Carl Sagan has said that the appeal of pseudosciences is that they seem to provide insight into the construct of the universe and how things work. Sagan contends that the realities science uncovers are more wondrous than the fantasies of the mystics. Livingston has filled in the information we need to appreciate what Sagan was talking about. I have put Driving Force on my basic reading list for anyone who seeks the knowledge needed to attack pseudoscience and quackery at their foundations.

It includes a brief review of magnetism and electronics, how these are viewed by the health sciences and pseudomedicine, and how devices are regulated by the FDA. A compendium of questionable electronic devices includes information about Radionics devices (Radioscope, Drown Devices, Rife Frequency Generator, Digitron), Galvanic devices (Energy Medicine, Ellis Microdynameter, E-Meter, Accupath 1000, Electroacuscope 80, Roscher Probe, QiGong Machine).

CONSUMER REPORTS UNFAIRLY ATTACKS ACSH Consumer Reports (CR) (5/94) carried an article, \"Public interest pretenders,\" that did a good job of exposing ostensible consumer groups which are funded by industry, such as an auto consumer group funded by the industry, a Coalition that is challenging the restaurant smoking ban in court supported primarily by tobacco companies, and so forth. Unfortunately, the article also contains a side-bar titled \"Forefront of science, or just a front?\" attacking the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) that was extremely unfair and without substance. CR's accusation that ACSH is a \"front\" was because it receives about 40% of its funding from industry. This was unfair because ACSH makes no attempt to hide this fact publicly listing its donors. ACSH limits the amount it will take from any single source. CR gave no evidence that industry funding has compromised any of ACSH's reports. After noting that ACSH's director stated that it accepts industry funding only for general operating funds, not earmarked for specific projects, CR did a lateral shift to a different matter of seeking money specifically to disseminate its work. Apparently CR cannot tell the difference between the integrity of a report and its distribution. Those of us who have been reviewers of ACSH reports know that the review process is very thorough, and is as good or better than that used by CR. Hints of why CR attacked is found in its reference to ACSH's 1994 report Alar Five Years Later: Science Triumphs Over Fear which showed virtual unanimity among scientist that alar was safe when used as intended. CRwas on the wrong side of the alar question with its outrageous cover story \"Bad apples\" (5/89). CR also has taken the fear-mongers side instead of the science of the bovine somatotropin (BST) issue (\"Utter insanity,\" CR, 5/92). CR accuses ACSH of being anti-regulatory, when it actually favors more regulation in many areas of consumer protection. Another possible reason for the attack may be the influence of CSPI's Michael Jacobson, a Consumer's Union board member, who accused ACSH of industry bias when it first organized and before it had issued a single report. Having been a member of the ACSH board of advisors (unpaid) since its inception, I can attest to its integrity and credibility. As an associate member of Consumers Union, I am distressed with CR, not only for its unwarranted attack on ACSH, but for taking the fearmonger, rather than the scientific, side of the alar and BST issues. Correspondence reveals that key members of the present staff believes that public perception is more important than scientific realities in controversial issues. I believe this is folly, for once a consumer organization abandons reality for perception, it become just another voice in the chaos of conflicting public opinions. Science provides a standard because it builds upon a provable base. CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE TOXICITY IN HONG KONG Physicians at the Dept. of Clinical Pharmacology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the Prince of Wales Hospital there, have collaborated on a review of the published work on the dangers of Chinese herbal and proprietary medicines. The article says that in Hong Kong, surveillance and legislation are required to control the use of these medicines, but the government is reluctant to interfere with Chinese culture and practice. The writers note that traditional Chinese medicines are shipped by mail around the world or brought by visiting friends. Among the hazards are known toxic herbs (10 of 150 most commonly used); adulteration (with cheaper, more toxic substances); inclusion in proprietary medicines of western drugs without warnings of possible side-effects; and, the fact that some contain toxic heavy metals (cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury). [\"Chinese herbal medicines revisited: a Hong Kong Lancet, 1993;342:1532-4] THE ANTIOXIDANT SCARE Vitaminophiliacs (vitamin-lovers extraordinaire) were stunned by the New England Journal of Medicine report (1994;330:1029-35) from Finland in which male smokers ingested antioxidant dietary supplements or a placebo. The exceptionally high quality intervention study concluded that antioxidants beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol not only did not confer benefits but that they may be harmful. This finding came as no surprise to NCAHF board member Dr. Victor Herbert who has been saying for several years that antioxidant pills act as redox agents making them pro-oxidant (ie, contributing free radicals to the cellular environment instead of sequestering them as the antioxidant theory of aging proclaims. For proof that Herbert can say \"I told you so!\" see NCAHF Newsletter, May-June, 1992. Some reporters have tried to pooh-pooh the findings by noting that the subjects were smokers. This is not a valid criticism for the reasons that (1) the effects of smoking were equalized in the control group; and, (2) vitamin sellers have been proclaiming that antioxidants were \"protectors\" and included smoking among the many possible things a person could be protected from. The fact is that the value of antioxidants has been more an illusion created by the vitamin hucksters than scientific reality. Addendum: On 4/29/94, the Vitamin Information Service, a Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. propaganda agency sent out a packet of previously published reports on the safety of vitamin E and beta carotene. Apparently the vitamin hucksters are concerned about the negative affect on their business that the Finland study results may have. MANGA REPORT CRITIQUE An Analysis of \"The Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Chiropractic Management of Low-Back Pain\"(1/21/94) by Toronto physician Hamilton Hall is a critique of a 1993 report by Canadian economist Pran Manga. Hall's analysis cites at least 70 points in the Manga report of bias, omission, lack of insight, inappropriate comparison, or other statement that is inconsistent with Manga's conclusions. Copies of the 15-page analysis are available from NCAHF. Send $2 and a double-stamped, business-sized, self-addressed envelope. According to The Digest of Chiropractic Economics (Mar-Apr, 1994, p.65) January Manga spoke at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in January and \"began his presentation by telling students that his own chiropractor is a Palmer graduate.\" It appears that Manga is a chiropractic devotee who has let his own personal experience color his reporting. HOMEOPATH ARRESTED Dr. Lawrence Taylor, 70, and his partner William Stacy, 46, who has posed as a doctor, were arrested on 3/24 at their Hillcrest, California office on charges of grand theft and 30 misdemeanor violations of the state health and safety codes. The men were promoting worthless drugs Immunostim and 714-X for terminal AIDS and cancer patients. (714-X is the concoction from Canada that inspired former congressman Berkeley Bedell to create the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. ) Taylor got widespread attention in 1991 for treating a Utah boy for cancer who was the focus of a parental dispute in which the mother wanted standard therapy at Mayo and the father wanted Taylor's methods. A Salt Lake City judge allowed for both kinds of treatment. Court records indicate that Taylor reduced the boy's standard drugs. He died that same year.

J Health Ed, 1994;25:(2):82-8 THE FRUITS OF THE ANTI-IMMUNIZATION IDEOLOGY The San Francisco Chronicle (4/20/94) reports on an outbreak of whooping cough at the Starchild Waldorf Preschool in Sonoma County (Calif) that is the result of anti-immunization beliefs of the families who send their children there (they also reject antibiotic therapy). Last year, another Waldorf school in the Santa Rosa area experienced a measles outbreak for the same reason. Waldorf schools are associated wit h Anthroposophical Medicine (AM) AM is an organization of the disciples of Rudolph Steiner. Steiner called for a rejection of materialism as a basis for scientific research; he believed that the concept of God and that the \"the divine element in nature\" should be introduced into the scientific enterprise. Steiner's published works are said to be over 300 volumes that cover art, religion, science and agriculture. His concept of biodynamic farming involved composting manure to enrich the soil; a method to produce foodstuffs that would nourish the spirit as well as the body [1].. AM practitioners frequently prescribe homeopathic remedies, study of musical instruments, social service projects, prayer and meditation [1]. There are some 300 Waldorf Schools in 21 countries, with about 19 in North America. James Randi has criticized the Steiner schools for teaching children to cast horoscopes and to believe that sprites inhabit trees and rocks [2]. Citations. 1. East/West J, 3/84; 2. Time, 4/13/92. [Note: It is not necessary for 100% of a population to be immunized to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases as long as the unprotected are spread throughout society, but when nonimmunized people cluster together for substantial time periods (such as in a school), outbreaks are likely to occur.] OUTMODED DENTAL INFECTION THEORY TRYING A COMEBACK The so-called \"focal infection theory,\" popular in the early 1900s, is being touted by Root Canal Cover-up Exposed! by George Meinig, DDS. The idea is that bacteria trapped in the dentin tubules can escape and be transported to other organs of the body where they start a whole new infection process. The theory led to the unnecessary removal of millions of teeth in a misguided effort to cure diseases supposedly caused by root canal therapy. Anti-dental amalgam guru, Hal Huggins, DDS, of Colorado also supports Meinig's notions and is mentioned in the book. The American Association of Endodontists (AAE) now offers a patient education brochure titled Are Your Root Canals Making You Sick? and a statement on the focal infection theory and a selected bibliography. These may be obtained from the AAE at 211 E. Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611; call 1-800-USA-ENDO for information. George Meinig is a Fellow of the Price-Pottenger Foundation, a proponent of dubious nutrition and health ideas related to dentistry. William Jarvis detailed some of these in a chapter on the problem of food faddism within dentistry in the textbook Nutrition In Oral Health and Disease (Lea & Febiger, 1985). PINHOLE EYEGLASSES FRAUD Two companies and three individuals who market pin-hole eyeglasses have agreed to settle FTC charges that they made false and unsubstantiated claims about the vision-improvement benefits of their product. $425,000 will be put into a fund for consumer redress. [FTC News Notes, 1994;94:(Issue 11):1] CHIROPRACTIC AND STROKES A study in which 177 California neurologists responded to the survey conducted by the Stanford Stroke Center found that within a 2-year period, 56 strokes had occurred among patients within 24-hours after receiving neck manipulation by a chiropractor. One patient died and 86% were left with permanent impairment. Most (53/56) involved intervertebral artery damage. The age range of patients affected was 21-60 with most occurring in young individuals. [From abstract: Carlini et al. \"Incidence of stroke following cervical chiropractic manipulation\" to be published near the end of 1994.] Comment: The risk of stroke following neck manipulation is well-known. NCAHF warned of this problem in its 1985 position paper on chiropractic. Proponents estimate the risk of chiro neck manipulation to be 1/million. We calculate that 56 strokes in 2 years in California alone at 1/million means that the state's 9200 DCs performed 56 million neck manipulations in 2 years; or 6,087 each (3,043.5 per yr). At 5 days/ week for 50 weeks, this would only be a little over 12 neck manipulations per work day, so the 1/million estimate seems quite plausible. The possibility that repeated neck manipulation injures the fragile lining of the intervertebral artery increasing the risk of a stroke at some time beyond the 24-hour time period is a very real possibility. If this is true, the number found in this study underestimates the risk. Thus, 1/million is a conservative estimate of the risk. This risk must be measured against the proven benefit of chiropractic neck manipulation which, in the face of a total absence of value is zero! The message is clear: Do not allow a chiropractor to manipulate your neck under under any circumstances. DEEPAK CHOPRA GETS AN UNFLATTERING REVIEW Forbes magazine makes Deepak Chopra, MD, look more like Bozo the Clown than Robert Fulton (as in \"they laughed at\u2014\") in \"Lord of Immortality*\" (4/11/94). Chopra is portrayed as \"the latest in a line of gurus who have prospered by blending pop science, pop psychology and pop Hinduism. The message: You can wish yourself young.\" The article quotes Dr. George Solomon, a pioneer in the field of psychoneuro-immunology as saying that Chopra may be doing the mind/body field of medicine a disservice by his overstatements and failure to adhere to science. When pressed for scientific evidence, says Forbes, Chopra proclaims that he has a medical degree (from All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi), and states, \"I am not at all attached to the scientific worldview at the moment. I see myself as a bum on the street who has a lot of fun writing.\" The article describes some of Chopra's current financial interests, including his consultant role at San Diego's Center for Mind Body Medicine where people spend $1,125 to $3,200 for a \"purification\" treatment of massages and herbal cures, plus lectures on ayurveda. [*The title conferred upon Chopra by TM guru Maharishi Mehesh Yogi (see NCAHF Newsletter, July-August, 1991)] STUDY VINDICATES SUGAR AND ASPARTAME & BEHAVIOR A double-blind, controlled trial with two groups of children, 25 normal (3-5 yrs) and 23 (6-10 yrs) described by their parents as sensitive to sugar, found that \"even when intake exceeds typical dietary levels, neither dietary sucrose nor aspartame affects children's behavior or cognitive function.\" [New Engl J Med, 1994;330:301-7] HERB PRODUCT ADULTERATED WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG A weight loss product called Quicky, manufactured by Neways, Inc. of Salem, Utah, was recalled by the FDA in November.

[Salt Lake City Tribune, KINESIOLOGY: COMPLETE HOAX OR UNDISCOVERED PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TOOL? William T. Jarvis, PhD Applied Kinesiology (AK)* (aka, Contact Reflex Analysis, Dental Kinesiology, or Behavioral Kinesiology) is a procedure in which resistance-response (aka, \"muscle strength testing\") explorations of an extended arm or leg is \"tested\" while a person is subjected to various influences (foods, vitamins, herbs, homeopathic remedies, music, colors, etc.). Weak responses are interpreted as \"bad,\" and strong responses as \"good.\" These form the basis for making diagnoses, prescriptions, food selections, or other health-related choices. [Note: AK is not part of the science-based field of Kinesiology, ie, \"the study of the principles of mechanics and anatomy in relation to human movement\" Webster's Dictionary.] AK has been associated with a number of cases of serious harm. A New York chiropractor used it to demonstrate alleged improvements in learning disabled children. The physical and psychological damage done to the kids by his treatments resulted in a $565,000 jury award. On the instructions of a holistic dentist, AK was employed as a way of testing the \"purity\" of foods by the family of a diabetic who died while trying to substitute vitamins for insulin. His wife (an RN!) refused to accept the reality of his death keeping his mummified body in the house for 8-years. The technique was used by a clinical ecologist to tell a mother that her children were not allergic to peanuts with the result that when given peanut butter their allergic reactions nearly killed them. He eventually lost his license to practice medicine for employing nonscientific techniques. AK was used by an Arizona chiropractor to assure a patient that she did not have cancer. She subsequently died due to lack of treatment. He was suspended from practice. Controlled studies of AK have repeatedly shown that responses are random under conditions where both the tester and test subject are unaware of the substance being tested, but the AK experience can be very persuasive under uncontrolled conditions because people can definitely feel the differences in responses. The subjective experience can be overwhelming and turns many patients into believers. AK's originator, chiropractor George Goodheart, organized the International College of Applied Kinesiology (ICAK) in an effort to gain some control over the practice and its claims. Goodheart once expressed skepticism about using AK to choose one's personal lucky star (subjects were tested while pointing at various candidate stars). Over time, ICAK has become more conservative in its claims for AK and now states that it is not valid used by itself. [Applied Kinesiology Status Statement, International College of Applied Kinesiology-USA, 6/16/92 ] Explanations of what is actually happening in AK responses range from trickery by practitioners, who may vary the point of contact on the lever (arm or leg) thus improving their mechanical advantage whenever they want to obtain a weak response; or, who catch the subject off-guard to elicit weakness versus telegraphing the test thus allowing a split-second for the subject to prepare their response. However, I believe that it may be a mistake to dismiss all AK practitioners as tricksters. It may be that AK users are fooling themselves through the uncontrolled use of a potentially useful psychological assessment tool. Just as Mesmerism unwittingly exploited the power of suggestion-the same potent psycho-physiological phenomenon of clinical hypnosis-AK may be a means of testing for the psychological make-up of subjects (eg, conditioning, expectation, suggestibility or other personality factors). On the other hand, AK could turn out to be unreliable or not as good as other tests now in use. Unfortunately, we are not aware of anyone who is studying AK scientifically to find its valid use.

The article gives some insight into how unorthodox practitioners view themselves. Such insights are useful to anyone who wishes to understand how well-intended, intelligent people can fall into quackery.

Consistent with other studies, sugar caused kids to become less active, not hyperactive as is commonly believed. (Pediatrics, 86:75, 1990). A second study, that measured blood glucose and insulin levels in 137 male juvenile delinquent teenagers and 41 non-delinquent controls, found that delinquent boys had slightly lower blood glucose and slightly higher blood insulin levels but there was no evidence of reactive hypoglycemia in either group.

Topics covered include fallacious theories and treatment about bad blood or bad food causing mental disorders; New Age brain-wave scams; positive approaches to integrating folk and scientific medicine in a cultural setting; the abuse of amino acids in psychotherapy; misdiagnosed emotional disorders (yeast infection, environmental sensitivity, chronic fatigue syndrome); unvalidated treatment of PMS; and mental health quackery in cancer care. Comment: This publication is a significant contribution to the literature on mental health quackery though it barely scratches the surface of this enormous field. FAT MAGNET SETTLES WITH FTC, TO REPAY CONSUMERS Allied International Corp., promoters of Fat Magnet, and one other corporate and three individual defendants, have agreed to settle charges that they made false and unsubstantiated claims for Fat Magnet diet pills. (FTC News Notes, 12/17/90) DEMONSTRATORS DISRUPT ALLERGY WORKSHOP John C. Selner, MD, reports the following incident that took place at the November meeting of the American College of Allergy and Immunology in San Francisco: We arrived at our workshop to find a number of patients confined to wheel chairs with oxygen masks in place, or wearing filters who were identifiable as patients with so-called environmental illness. Approximately 4-hours into the workshop I was confronted by a CBS radio news reporter who interrupted my presentation to ask if I was aware of a public demonstration in front of the hotel. ..The reporter indicated that he had been informed by environmental activists that a demonstration would take place. A clinical ecologist (MD) accompanied the demonstrators as they forced their way into the workshop. When asked to leave they refused and the ecologists demanded to have access to the platform. The workshop was recessed and the speakers disbursed to reconvene after the demonstrators had been evicted by the security personnel and local police. It appeared that the environmental activists had alerted ACT-UP members to cooperate with their demonstration. At least this would be the impression arrived at by the placards utilized by some of the demonstrators. It would appear that any programs that might address issues surrounding the effects of unproven and controversial methods of diagnosis and treatment may be targeted for such demonstrations in the future. Irony might be found in the fact that the message the co-moderators of this workshop were attempting to highlight for psychiatrists and psychologists was the importance of taking patients very seriously who present without objective signs of disease, but with the so-called environmental illness scenario, and to recognize many of these patients may be able to be helped. Further, we were attempting to emphasize the importance of environmental chemicals in the induction of disease including psychological presentations. Comment: It seems that organized quackery learned something about the media and the political system during the laetrile crusade. The tactics described are nearly identical to those used to legalize laetrile. Stewart notes in her monograph \"Emotional disorders misdiagnosed illness: environmental hypersensitivity, chronic fatique syndrome\" (Int J Ment Hlth, 19:56-68, 1990) that support groups not only lobby for legislation in recognition of their disabilities, and try to get the media to carry stories about people disabled by these disorders, but also threaten legal action against those who criticize the practice of clinical ecology and attempt to interfere with objective study of these disorders. SUPREME COURT REFUSES REVIEW OF CHIROPRACTIC ANTITRUST VERDICT On Nov. 26, 1990 the U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment review of the Wilk vs AMA case. Although less than a victory, the court lets stand a bizarre and twisted decision that not only defies reason and justice, but inhibits professional associations from organized opposition to pseudomedicine and quackery. Chiropractic public relations promoters have had a field day with this case generally misrepresenting it as validating chiropractic care. However, there is no evidence that MDs are any more willing to expose their patients to chiropractors through referrals than before. Chiropractors are discovering that it was not the AMA any more than doctors at the grass-roots level that regard them as hazardous to their patients' well-being.

LIABILITY CONCERNS CLOSE LIVINGSTON CLINIC A San Diego Judge responded to an attorney overseeing the estate of the late Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, MD, and ordered her clinic closed in early December. Concern was expressed over liability and the fact that there is no licensed physician available to head the corporation even though there are several MDs still working at the facility. According to the report, the possibility still exists that as yet unnamed individuals could take over its operation. One of VLW's stepsons, Gary Wheeler stated in an interview that \"Virginia once called it (the clinic) her little gold mine.\" An accountant's report shows it grossed from $2.1 to $3 million per year for the past five years. (San Diego Union, 12/9/90) VITAMIN A TOXICITY A believable review of the toxicity of vitamin A appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (52:183-202, 1990). Unlike a questionable review recently done by employees of a pharmaceutical firm known for its aggressive promotion of self- supplementation, this review is from the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The review concludes that although the scientific information is not sufficient to definitively provide a specific minimum threshold intake for adverse effects, an intake of 25,000 IU/d is nutritionally excessive and carries some risk of toxicity. An intake of 10,000 IU/d is more than adequate and low enough to avoid toxicity in most people, but cannot be guaranteed safe for all individuals in a large population. FOOD SENSITIVITIES IN CHILDREN Bock and Atkins report (The Journal of Pediatrics, 117:561-567, 1990) on 16 years of utilizing the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) as a method for diagnosing food sensitivities in children. 480 children, with a history of adverse reaction to food and subsequent confirmation by DBPCFC, were studied. Egg, peanut and cow milk accounted for 73% of DBPCFC positive reactions. Skin tests were positive in 98% of DBPCFC positive cases over 3 years of age (83% below 3 years). Negative skin test is a reliable exclusionary finding researchers say. DBPCFC is the \"gold standard\" for both research and clinical diagnosis of food sensitivities. Bock, et al, provide a manual illustrating the proper office procedure for administering the DBPCFC in The Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, 82:986-97, 1988. Comment: One of the most troubling and abused aspects of health care is the improper diagnosis of food allergies, intolerances and sensitivities in children. Failure to properly diagnosis a food allergy can be life-threatening; false diagnoses can prevent relief, and contribute to the development of health neurosis. These articles represent a major contribution to the field of pediatric allergy diagnosis and care. NEW FDA COMMISSIONER PLEDGES TOUGHER ENFORCEMENT New FDA Commissioner, David Kessler, who was sworn into office on Nov. 8, 1990, stated in a letter to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee that \"Improving enforcement at the agency will be among my highest priorities. I appreciate the fact that the heart and soul of the FDA is its nationwide field operations.\" Kessler co-authored a detailed study of the 1976 Medical Device Amendment and recommended many of the changes adopted by Congress. (The GMP Letter, November, 1990) Comment: NCAHF prays that Kessler will follow through. NCAHF's only concern is that Kessler's ex-boss and mentor was Senator Orrin Hatch who has demonstrated either a naivete or tolerance toward quackery. Hatch seems to support \"buccaneer entrepreneurialism\" (see NCAHF Newsletter, Nov-Dec, 1990). His home state of Utah is the heartland for many herbal multilevel firms engaging in large scale quackery. According to Health Foods Business (Nov. 1990, p.6), Hatch was responsible for last minute changes in the new nutritional food labeling bill that \"averted what could have been a devastating situation\" for the health foods industry. Hatch's changes exempted dietary supplements from the bill's health message requirements (an admission by the health foods industry that truthful labeling is bad for business!). The bill requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a separate procedure for evaluating supplement claims. Hatch clearly is no friend of consumer health education. Let's hope that Kessler has learned from Hatch by his negative example! THE BRITISH CHIROPRACTIC STUDY ANOMALY: WAS THE KEY PATIENT SATISFACTION? People familiar with clinical tests of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for back pain were puzzled by the outcome of the British study by Meade, et al, (Brit Med J, 300:1431-37, 1990) which found chiropractic care to be more effective in the long term than hospital management (for chronic back pain sufferers only). Studies designed to test SMT against other modalities have consistently found that although SMT may produce more rapid relief there are no differences over the long term (for a review see Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research, 179:62-70, 1983). The Meade study did not test SMT against other modalities but merely compared hospital with chiropractic care in which a flock of modalities were employed. It did not even equalize the number of treatment sessions nor length of time under care. The most likely answer to this anomalous finding lies in patient satisfaction. The Ostwestry Disability Questionnaire employed by Meade is a 10-item patient self-report on the relief of symptoms during specified activities. Although the test has high reliability (.99), this matter involves its validity. Cherkin reports \"there is mounting evidence that patient satisfaction is associated with desirable outcomes including self-assessed relief of symptoms\" (Chiropractic Technique, 2:138-142, 1990). Parker & Tupling (Med J Aust, 2:373-376, 1976) also reported: \"satisfaction at follow-up was associated with reported improvement in the condition, greater approval of chiropractic treatment, and less reporting of pain at follow-up.\" DCs generally score better than MDs on patient satisfaction because of such factors as: \"making the patient feel welcome\"; \"ability to explain problem & treatment\"(1); \"amount of time spent listening to my description of pain\"; \"seemed to believe that my pain was real\"; \"seemed confident that the diagnosis s/he gave was correct\"; \"seemed confident that the treatment s/he recommended would work\"; \"seemed comfortable dealing with my back pain\"; \"concern about my pain after the office visit\" (2). The explanation that patient satisfaction rather than real differences was responsible for better long term Ostwestry scores is supported by the fact that a significantly greater portion of chiro patients reported being \"satisfied or very satisfied\" in the Meade Study.

ACLU TO AID PSEUDOMEDICINE After a long hard struggle, the medical licensing board of North Carolina managed to delicense the only MD in the state practicing homeopathic pseudomedicine. Now the ACLU has decided to attempt to take a patient class-action case to the U.S. Supreme Court based upon a legal theory of the public's right to privacy and the practitioner's right to privacy and liberty. In other words, the ACLU will challenge the licensing board's duty to assure consumers of medical quality. Underlying this question is the fundamental that the practice of medicine is not a right but a privilege that should only be granted to competent, trustworthy individuals. The cult-like behavior of patients who will clamor on behalf of their guru should carry little weight in a matter of the state's duty to protect its citizens. It's disappointing to see the ACLU wasting its resources on the defense of pseudomedicine. FDA STOPS HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SALES The FDA's district office in Minneapolis has halted sales of Peroxy Gel and Peroxy Spray, products made with hydrogen peroxide and aloe vera, because of false claims that they could treat AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, and emphysema. These were products of Vital Health Products of Minneapolis, Conrad LeBeau, President. (FDA Consumer, 12/90) \"60 MINUTES\" DENTAL MERCURY REPORT CBS's 60 Minutes has again demonstrated its inability to either thoroughly investigate or fairly report on an important public health topic. Its December broadcast \"Is there poison in your mouth?\" was a public disservice of immense proportions. Dental offices were flooded with calls from panicky patients asking for their amalgams to be removed. A Newsweek article (1/14/91) offered some good advice: patients are subjected to far more mercury while having fillings removed than by leaving them in, and anyone with mysterious health problems should consult a physician, not a dentist. NCAHF would add that people should be sure that the physician is not a member of the American Quack Association! Addendum. 60 Minutes' mishandling of its report on alar has led to a $100 million lawsuit by the nation's apple growers. While the courts usually bend over backward to protect the network's freedom of speech, the tabloid-style TV show could be in for trouble. PARALYSIS FOLLOWING CHIROPRACTIC MANIPULATION In Sept-Oct, 1990 we reported on a tragic case of quadriplegia following chiropractic manipulation of the neck, and called for information on the risks of this procedure. A report from Canada cites an alert by the Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons that doctors warn patients about the risks involved in neck manipulation. The College had become alarmed after it found that six cases of brain stem injury had occurred in the province in the past 3-years. In all cases the patients suffered permanent paralysis. (The Medical Post, 1/28/86). A second report sent to NCAHF is an article from Neurology (40:611-615, 1990) describing 4 young (ages 28-41) healthy patients, who suffered strokes (Wallenberg's syndrome) following chiropractic neck manipulation over a 3-year period. All recovered with minor residual defects. NCAHF continues to be concerned about the justification for forceful neck manipulation under any circumstances. It is doubtful that the procedure could survive an objective benefit-risk assessment. We are unaware of any condition that can be helped by neck manipulation that merits the serious consequences of paralysis or stroke even if the probability of injury is slight. Neither are we reassured that the risk is only slight. CLINICAL ECOLOGIST MD LOSES LICENSE Irvine Allen Korman, MD, of Willowdale, Ontario, has lost his license for professional misconduct and incompetence. Korman's questionable practices included testing a patient for allergies by swinging a quartz ball attached to a string (ie, medical dowsing). He also advised a patient to have her metal dental fillings removed and that she was \"allergic to electricity.\" Korman acknowledges that he has left the world of scientific medicine and practices \"energy medicine.\" Several of his patients testified in glowing terms as to the success the doctor had in treating their \"environmental illnesses.\" (Toronto Star, 10/19/90) Addendum. Readers may remember Korman from a report in the May-June, 1989, NCAHF Newsletter in which his license was suspended following the near-death of child he misdiagnosed using Applied Kinesiology (muscle-testing). MAVERICKS GROAN AS FDA MOVES AGAINST CLINIC On Sept. 6 and Oct. 25, FDA agents raided the Century Clinic in Reno, Nevada, seizing patient records, products and medical devices. Among the items seized was a Dermatron (a device used in the speculative field of \"Energy Medicine\" which alleges to measure electrical resistance on so-called \"acupuncture points\" from which diagnoses and prescriptions are made), homeopathic remedies, enzymes and other items. The Century Clinic is operated by Yiwen Tang, MD, who formerly practiced in San Francisco. Tang referred to the federal agents as \"Nazis\" (apparently he has never had any experience with real Nazis) and moaned \"I thought this was a free country!\" Comment: The country sometimes seems freer than perhaps it should be, especially when it comes to the freedom allowed questionable doctors to continue practicing. For instance, Tang is permitted to practice in Nevada after the state of California placed his medical license on inactive status following an investigation into his use of laetrile as a cancer therapy and charges of negligence and incompetence (Las Vegas Review Journal, 3/4/1987). A bright note is that FDA San Francisco Regional Director Ron Johnson was quoted as saying that \"these devices have been imported and manufactured in this country illegally; we regard these devices to be illegal no matter who uses them.\" NCAHF is pleased with Johnson's statement. Heretofore, FDA has ducked enforcing the 1976 Medical Device Act against practitioners using these devices on the basis that jurisdiction belonged to state licensing boards. The boards apparently expected FDA to enforce the federal law more vigorously than it was doing. The result was nobody did anything and unapproved devices proliferated. FOOD COMPANIES TOLD TO REMOVE HEALTH CLAIMS The FDA sent warning letters to 6 food companies telling them to remove unsubstantiated health claims. Most were bran products. In some cases FDA complained that there was insufficient bran in a serving of the product even if evidence existed to justify a claim for bran. (FDA Consumer, 11/90) INSIGHT INTO THE MACROBIOTIC DIET SHAM Two Nutrition Forum articles, \"The Macrobiotic Diet: no cancer seminar for professionals\" (May-June, 1990) provide valuable insight into the background, claims, promotion, and lack of validity of the Macrobiotic Diet. NCAHF considers Macrobiotics to be very dangerous because of needless deaths that have occurred due to applying its philosophy to cancer care. Cases of malnutrition and starvation have also been associated with the Macrobiotic Diet. AYURVEDIC DOCS PROMOTE UNPROVEN AIDS PILLS Two British doctors have been accused of offering patients an expensive AIDS treatment that offers no substantial benefit. Drs. Roger Chalmers and Leslie Davis belong to front organizations for the Transcendental Meditation cult of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and three herbal concoctions are called Maharishi Ayurvedic pills. The doctors regard the contents of the pills as secret and refuse to reveal their contents. They claim that the pills inhibit virus proliferation. The doctors are unable to produce evidence of effectiveness. Independent tests conducted by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control found that the pills had a negligible effect upon the HIV virus, but were 100,000 times more toxic than AZT. The report contains a curious story about deceased AIDS patient Steve Nixon who learned of Ayurvedic medicine through newspaper articles. Nixon was required to take part in an initiation ceremony in which he was told to bring offerings of fresh fruit and flowers and lay them on an altar in front of a picture of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (MMY was once the Beatles' guru). Also challenged is the claim that Ayurvedic medicines have no negative side-effects as claimed by the doctors. Warnings have been given about both TM and the Maharishi Ayurvedic Diet. (The Independent on Sunday, 8/19/90) PHARMACISTS' SUPPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS SURVEY A survey of pharmacists and their practices in the USA vs the UK found that 40% of US vs 28.6% of UK pharmacists recommended vitamin-mineral supplements more than 5 times per week. A large number placed non-specific symptoms of fatigue and stress among the 5 most common reasons why they recommended supplements. (J Clin Pharm & Therap, 15:131-139, 1990) T. Ph.D. \"Today's unorthodoxy is probably going to be tomorrow's convention ..\" Prince Charles, 1983 The notion that many of the great medical innovators of the past were quacks who are recognized today as simply being ahead of their times, known to debunkers of pseudoscience as \"The Galileo Ploy\", is deeply embedded into Western folk culture. As appealing as this idea is (we all love cliches such as \"I told you so!\" and \"They said it couldn't be done, but he went right ahead and did it anyway!\"), historical facts do not support the myth that today's quacks will become tomorrow's medical heroes (its corollary that some of yesterday's medicine would be considered quackery if promoted today is more likely to be true). In 1847, Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-65), observed that a maternity ward differed from a second with a lower mortality rate in that students came directly from the dissecting room and made vaginal exams with unclean hands. Autopsy studies revealed that fatal infections were the same. Semmelweis instituted precautions (thorough scrubbing in a chlorinated lime and sand solution) that cut the death rate by 2/3's. His university friends were convinced that Semmelweis had found the answer and urged him to publish his findings and speak before medical groups. Although sternly positive in his teaching, he refused to write and was hesitant about speaking. His medical associates spoke on his behalf. At that time before germs had been discovered, a large number of practitioners vehemently opposed the reforms Semmelweis' supporters advocated. Opposition to Semmelweis' methods was led by his clinic director, Professor Klein, whose methods he was challenging and whom he had irritated in the past. Although opposition was strong among Viennese doctors it did not prevent him from being appointed Professor of Theoretical and Practical Midwifery at the University of Pest in 1855. In 1861, he finally published his theories and findings in a book described as \"disorganized and difficult to follow\" but \"moving, best documented and closely reasoned.\" The deaths of his first two children (1862-3) depressed him and coupled with his disappointment over the failure of his book to persuade his adversaries, his mind became deranged. Semmelweis died in 1865 of the same kind of an infection, contracted during an operation, about which he had written. Ironically, the day before Semmelweis died, Joseph Lister of Glasgow, acting on Louis Pasteur's publications (Pasteur was a Professor of Chemistry, not a physician) for the first time used carbolic acid in treating a compound fracture wound. Within twenty years Semmelweis' contribution to medical science was recognized. Semmelweis, or other innovators who met resistance, are not suitable models to be used to justify quackery. Rather, they are part of the history of science which recognizes that although people wrongly \"laughed at Fulton\" they rightly laughed at many, many more cranks, clowns and charlatans who were promoting nonsense. The only way to tell the difference is for proponents to produce evidence that is reproducible by others who are both skeptical and qualified to do the work. At no time did Semmelweis behave as a quack. He did not promote his methods through advertising and publicity; he demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of his methods by experimental evidence, not by anecdotes or testimonials; and, he did not seek to escape accountability by arguing for freedom of choice for his patients.
