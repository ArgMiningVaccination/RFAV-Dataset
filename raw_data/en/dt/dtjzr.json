The heart is intrinsically involved in the interplay between inner and outer, the dynamic boundary between self and the environment. At the same time, it is the center and lifeblood of the human organism, just as the Sun is for the living Earth. By exploring the wide fields of the heart's functions, Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler sheds light on how immunity is integrally connected with the heart and the inner sense of self. If we disempower the individual through anxieties and fears or through dependence on outer authority, we reduce the confidence and strength of self. This leads in turn to a significantly reduced ability of the immune system to fend itself against outer influences, such as viruses and other pathogenetic influences. The author leads us on a path, showing how strengthening our inner spiritual life\u2014our inner sun\u2014will also strengthen our health and immunity and illumine riddles of conscience and common sense.
