Enable cookies to use the shopping cart This Everyday Aromatherapy range has been especially created to be very budget friendly, so no-one needs to compromise their families health by using toxic, harmful to health candles using artificial perfume, colours and/or paraffin wax. Approx 5.6cm in height, 8.9cm diameter. You may wonder why we've decided to make our own? We have noticed when shopping for Citronella candles for ourselves, (before deciding to make our own) that they smelt quite unpleasant to us as well as the bugs they are designed to keep away, this is because mostly they are just citronella (not the prettiest of oils we feel), mixed with paraffin wax a known harmful wax to burn, and they then when we did find a citronella candle made with a non-toxic wax such as soy wax it was in such small quantities of essential oil that the candles would hardly be effective, we saw a need for something much more effective, after research we established a blend of essentials oils much more effective than just citronella alone and smelling a lot nicer too-this has led to this NEW 'Bugs Away' blend being created unique to us at LOCK & LATCH. As with our Everyday Aromatherapy range we wanted this range to be in a one grab tin, which has a strike paper on the underneath and a safety match included under the lid, so you can keep one or a number of these in a safe place where all the family knows where they are kept incase of an impromptu picnic, garden party, BBQ or even in an emergency such as a power shortage. They can even be popped into your holiday luggage or an emergency go-bag, being in a tin rather than glass means these are a lighter, safer, waterproof option for travel. When empty these tins are perfect for use around the home, such as storing matches, dried herbs and spices, all you need is to clean them thoroughly and add a label of what's inside.
