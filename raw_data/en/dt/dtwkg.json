Immune Support Lifestyle Recommendations 1. Start an exercise routine Regular mild-to-moderate exercise has been shown to support overall health as well as a healthy immune system. Extreme exercises, however, has been shown to have a suppressive effect on the immune system. 2. Minimize alcohol consumption Try to abstain from alcohol, and avoid drinking more than 2 drinks on any given day. Alcohol is known to cause inflammation and suppress the immune system. 3. Sleep is key The immune system is very active when we are asleep. Ensure proper sleep hygeine with a cool, dark room. Also consider powering down electronics about 45 minutes before sleep as these can worsen sleep quality. 4. Address stress Stress is directly linked with immune suppression. Increase ways to focus on relaxation in your life. Consider a meditation app or yoga class. Lower stress leads to increased energy for the things you want to do. 5. Increase hydration Be sure to stay hydrated with pure filtered water and not sugar-sweetened beverages. Healthy hydration is an important requirement for the body to keep it from becoming weakened and thus susceptible to disease. Dietary Recommendations 1. Avoid too much sugar Too much sugar can increase inflammation and can hinder the immune system's ability to fight infection when in excess. 2. Eat more garlic and onions Garlic and onions are part of the group of plants called \"alliums.\" These spicy plants are high in phytochemicals that support the immune system and are antimicrobial in their own right. 3. Increase fruits and vegetables with color A varied diet of some fruits and mostly vegetables provides a plethora of key nutrients and vitamins to support the immune system and overall wellness. 4. Cook with herbs and spices Rosemary, ginger, tumeric, coriander, parsley, and thyme all provide supportive phytochemicals that encourage robust health. 5. Indulge in fermented foods Fermeneted foods support a healthy gut flora, which in turn has immune-supportive benefits.
