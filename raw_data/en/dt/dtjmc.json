Method: This protocol conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta - Analysis Protocols (PRISMA -P) and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We selected qualified studies published as of May 1, 2022 , and systematically searched 6 English database (Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central of Cont rolled Trials (CENTRAL ), and Clinicaltrials.gov) and 5 Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) , VIP Database for Chinese T echnical Periodicals, Wanfandata, SinoMed, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry). At the same time, relevant reviews and a list of references included in the study were retrieved, and Epistemonikos.org, ISI Web of Science and OpenGrey were manually searched to screen any other studies not included in the previous search. There will be no language restrictions. The inclusion criteria were clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving the use of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of varicocele. The main results were fertility rate, adverse events, semen quality and scrotal pain score after 3 months , 6 months and 1 year follow -up. Bias analysis and evaluation will be performed based on risk of bias (ROB) assessment tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook. And use GRADEpro GDT to grade, evaluate and score the quality of the evidence. Heterogeneity will be judged by I2 value.

According to the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Evaluation of Interventions (Higgins 2011), if the data showed sufficiently high quality and some degree of similarity, we included the data for the meta -analysis. For dichotomy data, we selected an effect scale relative risk (RR) represented by a 95% confidence interval (CI). The continuous data is expressed as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Result: This study will provide high -quality evidence for the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of varicocele in subfertile men. Conclusion: This study will provide an eff ective and safe choice for Chinese herbal medicine to improve the fertility of patients with varicocele. Ethics: The data of this study are based on published studies and do not require additional ethical approval. We will publish our findings through peer-reviewed journals.

The pathogenesis of VC is not clear. At present, the mainstream view is the increase of local temperature in the scrotum [6] , oxidative stress [7] , kidney and adrenal gland [8] lead to decreased spermatogenic function and poor sperm quality. Although some patients with varicocele can give birth normally without intervention, most patients still need active intervention to achieve be tter results [9]. At present, surgical treatment is widely used in patients with abnormal semen parameters [10]. However, surgical repair is not always accompanied by an improvement in sperm quality [11] and an increase in pregnancy rate [12]. Therefore, some patients and doctors try to seek adjuvant treatment of Chinese herbal medicine to improve the curat ive effect. Although some basic studies have confirmed that the use of traditional Chinese medicine can improve sperm quality through antioxidant and anti -inflammatory effects [13-16], the lack of clinical evidence st ill makes the application of Chinese herbal medicine in the shadow. Before this study, some researchers tried to make a meta -analysis of the effects of Chinese herbal medicine , but did not get a credible result [17]. Therefore, on the basis of previous studies, this study will further include new studies, optimize the retrieval strategy, and systematically evaluate the improvement effect and safety of Traditional Chinese medicine on the fertility of patients with varic ocele, so as to provide evidence -based medical basis for clinical All rights reserved.

This protocol of the systematic review has been registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration number : CRD42022331218 ). 2.1 Inclusion criteria 2.1.1 Types of participants This study includes participants who having had normal sex (or married) for more than 2 years but did not make the spouse pregnant . Participants who were infertile due to immunization problems, female fertility problems , or other causes were excluded . 2.1.2 Types of intervent ions Various forms of formula, including decoction, pill, electuary, with or without other therapeutic interventions, can be included a nd meets the following criteria. 1. Traditional Chinese Herb versus no treatment/any treatment. 2. Traditional Chinese He rb combined with other therapies versus the same other therapies. For grou ps that use the same prescription but have multiple doses, their results will be combined. If ther e are multiple dose groups, first determine whether the same prescription has a clear target dose (standard dose). If there is a definite target dose, we only need to extract the data of the target dose group and combine the target dose All rights reserved.

If there is no clear target dose, it is necessary t o compare whether the dose groups included in the literature are consistent. If there is consistency, the data of each dose group are extracted independently and meta -analysis. If there is no consistency, the data of multiple different dose groups need to be merged, and the mean and SD of multiple dose combinations can be calculated according to the following formula. Suppose there are two different dose groups, the sample size of dose group A is N 1, the mean is M 1, and the standard deviation of SD 1; dose g roup B is N 2, the mean is M 2, and the standard deviation is SD 2. The combined sample size is N= N 1+ N 2, the mean is M = (N 1 M1+ N 2 M2) / (N 1+ N 2), and the SD is: Assuming that there are several different dose groups, according to the above formula, the data of two dose groups are merged first, then the data obtained are combined with the third dose group, and so on. 2.1.3 Types of studies This study is intended to include a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) involving the use of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of varicocele. Animal experiments, case reports and non -randomized controlled trials were excluded. And there will be no additional restrictions on the language. 2.1.4 Types of outcomes According to the recommendations of the guid elines and previous studies [18-20]. The following main outcome indicators were set . All rights reserved.

Fertility rate at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after follow -up b. Adverse events 2.1.4.2 Secondary outcomes a. Semen quality b. Scrotal pain score 2.2 Data sources and search methods 2.2.1 Electronic searches We systematically searched 6 English database (Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central of Co ntrolled Trials (CENTRAL ), and Clinicaltrials.gov ) and 5 Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) , VIP Database for Chinese T echnical Periodicals, Wanfandata, SinoMed, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ). In addition, we will retrieve relevant reviews and a list of references included in the study, and manually search Epistemonikos.org, ISI Web of Science and OpenGrey to find any other studies not included in the previous search. We selected qualified studies published as of Ma y 1, 2022. The combination of subject terms and free terms is used as the retrieval strategy. The retrieval strategy is decided by all the participants. The main search terms are varicocele, varicocelectomy and Chinese herbal medicine. T ake Embase as an ex ample, the retrieval strategy is shown in T able 1. And adjust the specific database accordingly. 2.3 Data collection and export All the literatures were imported into Endnote X9 software (Thomson Research Soft, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted January 10, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.09.23284339doi: medRxiv preprint Stanford, Connecticut). First of all, duplicate documents are eliminated through the duplicate checking function of endnote, and then two independent reviewer (Wenting T ong and Zhimin Zhao ) read titles and abstracts to eliminate unqualified documents, and then conduct full -text screening of th e remaining documents to determine whether they meet the inclusion requirements, and seek the help of language experts for studies that need translation. Finally, the two reviewer compare the screening process for consistency according to the PRISMA flowch art. Any differences during the screening process will be agreed upon through discussions between the reviewers or by seeking the advice of a third reviewer (Hui Zhang). The selection process is recorded in the PRISMA flow chart [21]. 2.4 Data extraction and analysis Develop an excel data extraction table and extract data independently from the included qualified studies by two independent reviewer. Any differences will be settled by All rights reserved.

Any differences in the extraction process will be agreed upon through discussions between the two parties or seeking the advice of a third party (Hui Zhang). The mai n data extracted are as follows : Title, author, year, source of funding, sample size, age, duration of disease, specific interventions, Fertility rate (if applicable), how to confirm pregnancy, semen quality (if applicable ), scrotal pain score (if applicable), adverse events. And the randomization method of the study, the specific blind method, the nature of the study, the follow -up time, and record the basic situation of the woman, such as the age of the partner and whethe r to exclude the infertility caused by the female factor (if applicable). If the data are missing, try to contact the lead author of the study. 2.5 Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies The two researchers will conduct bias analysis and assess ment based on risk of bias (ROB) assessment tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook [22]: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting) and other bias. Evaluate and fully describe the basis of judgment through the three gr ades of \"low bias\", \"high bias\" and \"ambiguity bias\". Any differences in the screening process shall be discussed by both parties or seek third parties (Hui Zhang) . 2.6 Assessment of heterogeneity The heterogeneity of this study will be judged by the I2 value. If I2 < 50% , P > 0.1, we believe that there is no statistical heterogeneity among the included studies, and the fixed All rights reserved.

If there is obvious heterogeneity (I2 < 50%, P > 0.1), we use the random effect model (REM) for meta analysis, or consider a descriptive analysis without merging the results. 2.7 Assessment of reporting biases For publication bias, funnel chart and Egger linear regression analysis to test whether there is publication bias were used if the number of studies included was more than 10. The report bias will be done through R software. 2.8 Data synthesis According to the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Evaluation of Interventions (Higgins 2011), if the data showed sufficiently high quality and some degree of similarity, we included the data in the meta -analysis. For dichotomy data, we selected an effect scale relative risk (RR) represented by a 95% confidence interval (CI). The continuous data is expressed a s mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). We plan to compare the baseline to the changes after the intervention rather than individual final measurements. According to the heterogeneity test results, we choose fixed effect model or rand om effect model. According to the specific situation, subgroup analysis and meta regression were carried out. If it is not suitable for merger analysis, descriptive analysis is used. If there is a lack of key data in the study, we will try to contact the m ain authors of the study to obtain the missing data. If the above methods ca n't help us to obtain data, we will take the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) stochastic simulation method as the guidance, based on the multiple filling method to deal with the missing values, in order to fit the missing data to the maximum extent.

If necessary, the study of subclinical varicocele is distinguished. 2.10 Sensitivity analysis We conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the stability and reliability of the results of this study, and sensitivity analysis will be carried out through R software. 2.11 Grading the quality of evidence We use Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool to evaluate the quality of the evidence. The comparison will be evaluated by two reviewers based on recommended ratings, and any inconsistencies in the assessment will be decided by a third reviewer . 3. Discussion Varicocele surgery is often used in patients who expect to improve sperm parameters, but successful surgery does not mean s acceptable results. Apart from the improvement in the reproductive capacity of some patients [23] , many patients did not achieved significant benefits [1]. As a supplementary treatment of surgery, Chinese herbal medicine is widely used in the treatment of varicocele. However, because the shortage of existing research, the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment is still confusing, and it is worth more discussion on related issues. In addition, the ingredients of Chinese herbal All rights reserved.

Therefore, the side effects in the use of Chinese herbal medicine are also the issues we need to concern . We tried to evaluate specific prescriptions in this study, however, because the regulation of drugs in traditional Chinese medicine is reflected in the dose of individual drugs in the prescription, and that each individual has a unique physique, based on t he different understanding of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, it is difficult to use the same prescription for comprehensive analysis. Therefore, we regard traditional Chinese medicine as a whole intervention and look for evidence -based medicin e that Chinese herbal medicine prescription plays a role in the a djuvant treatment of varicocele, just like the research related to acupuncture [24, 25].
