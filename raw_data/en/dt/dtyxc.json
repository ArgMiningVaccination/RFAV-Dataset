The demand for medical care and the complexity of the care delivered have increased. Narrowing insurance networks have decreased access and eroded continuityof care. Increased physician productivity ex- pectations have led to shorter clinic visits and decreased time with patients. New regu-latory requirements (meaningful use, e-pre- scribing, and medication reconciliation) and more widespread penetration of elec-tronic health records (EHRs) have increased clerical burden. 1,2Simultaneously, an array of metrics (eg, patient satisfaction, howrapidly physicians process inbox messages and close charts, quality measures, and rela- tive value unit generation) have been intro-duced to assess physician performance. 3 These measures are imperfect, often fail tocapture the nature of physicians 'work, and leave many physicians feeling micromanaged and demoralized. 2-4Time and motion studies as well as analyses using EHR timestamps indicate that 50% of the physician workday is now spent on administrative work and \"desktop medicine. \" 5,6Much ofthis clerical work is performed on personal time, with studies suggesting that the average physician spends 28 hours on clin-ical documentation on nights and weekends each month. 7 Although each of these changes had an underlying rationale and, in many cases, were intended to improve patient care or manage costs, they place new burdens onphysicians. As a result, many physicians feel the care delivery system has become a barrier to providing high-quality care ratherthan a supportive infrastructure facilitating it. 3,8National studies indicate that the prev- alence of burnout in physicians is dramati-cally higher than that in the general US working population. 4,9,10Extensive evidence indicates professional burnout, and erosionof meaning in work have both personal and professional implications. 11,12Recog- nizing the importance of this problem, anumber of vanguard organizations and pro- fessional societies have prioritized address- ing this issue. 13To date, these efforts have typically focused on a collection of opera- tional approaches to improve ef ciency, redesign work flows, and enhance teamworkFor editorial comment, see page 1401 From the Department of Medicine (T.D.S.), Depart-ment of Otolaryngology(L.B.M.), Department of Psy-chiatry and Behavioral Stanford School of Medi-cine, Stanford, CA; Organiza-tional Culture and LeadershipInstitute, Menlo Park, CA (E.S.,P.S.); and Association ofAmerican Medical Colleges, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

UNDERSTANDING CULTURE Although physician distress and some of the contributing factors are now widely recog-nized, we believe that many of these prob- lems are symptoms of more insidious issues affecting the culture of our professionas well as the culture of our health care orga- nizations and the health care delivery sys- tem. Culture refers to the shared and fundamental beliefs, normative values, and related social practices of a group that are so widely accepted that they are implicitand no longer scrutinized. In the life of indi- viduals, organizations, and societies, culture is a pervasive, powerful, and often unseenforce. Although visible manifestations of cul- ture, such as workplace regulations, policies, benets, tolerance of mistreatment or harass- ment, professional behavior, and the incen- tive system, are often mistaken for culture, such characteristics are better thought of as climate and can be altered through the ac- tions and in fluence of an individual leader or group of leaders. Culture is more expansive, multifaceted, and deeply rooted in the history of the pro-fession or organization. Culture provides identity, order, meaning, and stability. Cul- ture is preserved over time (passed fromolder members to younger members) because it served an adaptive purpose that allowed a group to endure through historicalchallenges. 21There are at least 3 levels to culture.21Artifacts (or symbols) are the visible manifestations of culture dour ac- tions, behaviors, heroes, and rituals. Espoused values are what we claim our values and priorities to be, as manifested in missionstatements, the communications shared across the organization or profession, pub- licly stated values, and even advertisingand promotional messaging. Tacit assump- tions are the underlying things we truly believe and value, that is, the unwritten rulesthat drive our daily behavior. In this context, it should be emphasized that the term arti- facts refers to tangible characteristics of the culture or institution not \"something belonging to an earlier period \"or\"a specious effect. \" In the culture of medicine broadly, how we design clinics as well as how we treat pa- tients and colleagues are examples of arti-facts; the Hippocratic Oath and the Charter on Professionalism 22are examples of espoused values. The belief that physiciansshould always be motivated by the best inter- est of the patient is an example of a tacit assumption. In addition to the overarching culture of the profession, physicians practice within or-ganizations that have their own cultures. Each health care organization has its own ar- tifacts (eg, their policies about access for theunderserved or their compensation system), espoused values (the mission statement), and tacit assumptions (we exist to providemedical care to all residents in our commu- nity regardless of the ability to pay [or not]). A review of the mission statementsof nearly all US health care organizations in- dicates that they claim to be committed to providing the highest quality of care to indi-vidual patients in need. They simultaneously espouse different degrees of emphasis on compassion, learning, discovery, healing hu-manity, and strengthening communities, all of which are noble ambitions. They differ at the tacit assumption level in the degreeto which they emphasize other values such as quality, community or employee health, or economics as deep drivers of theirpractices. DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS IN THE CULTURE OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH CARE When challenges with culture arise, they almost always relate to a problem with a sub- component of the culture even as the largerculture is well adapted to operating realities. A simple way to diagnose problems with a given dimension of culture is to look at in-congruity between artifacts and espoused values. This is often best accomplished through group interviews and discussionHEALING THE CULTURE OF MEDICINE Mayo Clin Proc. nAugust 2019;94(8):1556-1566 nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2019.03.026 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org1557among members of the organization or pro- fession along with external experts (often consultants) who are not part of the culture.The inclusion of experts from outside the culture is important because insiders often become blind to some inconsistencies andmight opt for an approach that violates some fundamental mission assumptions without realizing it.When we see behavior that does not reflect espoused values, it invites re flection to identify the tacit assumption that mayactually be driving behavior. 21In this frame- work, we would propose that challenges with the EHR, excessive clerical work, over-emphasis on productivity (generating rela- tive value units), loss of flexibility/ autonomy, and too little time with patientsTABLE 1.

This incongru- ence reveals the deeper more fundamentaltacit assumptions of our organizations, health care delivery systems, and our profes- sion that require re flection. We must acknowledge that at the profes- sional level, we have some blind spots and unhealthy norms that can lead to potentiallydestructive behavior. As physicians, we tend to overwork, imply that normal human lim- itations do not apply to us, and often assumethe role of a hero. 23-26We inculcate future physicians with a mindset of perfectionism, lack of vulnerability, and low self-compas- sion.27We teach them that they should al- ways defer self-care and personalrelationships as long as needed to meet pro- fessional demands. Mistakes are the fault of the individual and are unacceptable. 25,28To err is human, but we are superhuman. We espouse the importance of prevention, self- care, and personal behaviors to promotehealth for our patients, but often do not engage in these behaviors ourselves. 29-31 We prioritize professional life above all, even if it means we are working in a manner that is not sustainable or that renders our medical decision making suboptimal.25 One view is that these approaches served a purpose in historical settings in which there were too few physicians da world in which all physicians needed to care for as many patients as possible and, in such situa- tions, an exhausted physician was betterthan no physician at all. Similarly, 50 years ago, individual perfectionism by an authori- tarian physician was our profession 's approach to quality. In most settings today, these assumptions no longer serve the best interest of patients, physicians, or our caredelivery system. In the cultures of our organizations and the health care system, there is also incon-gruence between behaviors and espoused values. 32-34We claim to believe that physi- cians are competent and trustworthy profes-sionals who set, maintain, and enforce professional standards but payers and regu- lators have created a tedious process of pre-authorization and onerous documentationrequirements that are costly and inef cient and show a lack of trust. 1,35We claim that physicians are our most valuable resourcebut saddle them with excessive, low-value, clerical work. 2We decry con flicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry yet simul-taneously promulgate compensation systems in our health care organizations that are designed to maximize productivity overquality, reward overuse of resources, and treat physicians like a unit of production rather than a professional. 36-38We claim to value shared decision making and personal- ized care for patients yet demand 20- minute of ce visits that do not provide adequate time to pursue these goals.39Our mission statements espouse social justiceand fair distribution of resources for our pa- tients and communities, 32,33,40yet we use organizational tactics that limit access onthe basis of ability to pay. These incongruities between stated values and organizational behavior are clearto physicians and create cognitive disso- nance that breeds cynicism and a sense of misalignment between the organization 's goals and the altruistic aims of the profes- sion. What can we do to change some of the tacit assumptions that are driving thissystem or ameliorate their negative effects? THE IMPERATIVE FOR CULTURE CHANGE Cultures change when there is a stimulus that upsets the equilibrium. Leaders and members of a culture must believe some- thing bad will happen if they do not change.This precipitates \"survival anxiety. \" 21There is now overwhelming evidence that this is the situation that our profession, our organi-zations, and the US health care delivery sys- tem nd themselves in. Symptoms of burnout and professional distress aredramatically more common in physicians than in workers in other elds. 4,9,10Burnout has been associated with social problemsranging from broken relationships to aban- doning the profession. 41Equally concerning, there are clear associations between burnoutand mental disorders, including substance abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicidal- ity. 42-45At the professional level, our lackHEALING THE Clin Proc. nAugust www.mayoclinicproceedings.org1559of self-care, dysfunctional fatigue/exhaustion, lack of vulnerability, and \"physician as hero \"mentality are not serving us well. Survival anxiety should also be high for all stakeholders in our health care organiza-tions and delivery system. Physician burnout is associated with reduced quality of care, increased medical errors, and lower patientsatisfaction. 11,12,46,47Multiple studies now report that burnout is associated with reduced productivity, turnover, and physi-cians leaving the profession, 41,48-50all of which threaten access to care precisely at a time we are already facing substantial short-ages of physicians. 51The threat and the imperative for change are not hypothetical. There are already negative effects on patientcare, the profession, and the system in which they interact. Once survival anxiety occurs, an opposing force d\"learning anxiety \"dis also created and manifests as resistance to change. 52The essence of learning anxiety is the realization that we may not be able to make the changes needed to solve the prob- lem. They will be too dif cult, too costly, ortoo disruptive. The resulting resistance to change often manifests as minimizing the problem, ignoring evidence, or total denial.21 It also takes the form of defending tradition (\"This is how we 've always done it. \"), using anecdotes ( \"It worked for me. \"), blaming the individual ( \"You chose this profession. \"), suggesting change will be too costly ( \"We don 't have the resources. \"), trying to justify ignoring one problem by articulating a larger unrelated or tangentially related problem (\"There are children starving in Africa. \"or \"Many of our patients cannot even afford to buy food. \"), or the belief that virtues and vice cannot be separated (eg, \"If we acknowledge human limitations, we cannot uphold high standards. \"). INITIATING CULTURE CHANGE Survival anxiety and learning anxiety are competing forces. The key to initiatingchange is tipping the balance of these forces (Figure ). 21Although the temptation is to do so by further increasing survival anxiety, thisapproach often just increases resistance to change and the tension in the system.

To do so, we must nd speci c areas in which change is feasible and in which the in- dividuals who will have to change areengaged and supported rather than forced to change. We begin by articulating a compelling positive vision of what the ideal future state would look like. The recently published Charter on Physician Well-being is an excel- lent framework from which to build. 53 Mature cultures, such as the culture of med-icine and the culture of most health care or-ganizations, typically must unlearn some old habits and ways of thinking before new ones can be incorporated. Once we have de nedthe ideal future state, we can then evaluate how it differs from the present state and identify gaps and barriers that need to be addressed to make progress ( Table 2 ). This comparison helps us de ne the old beliefs and habits we need to unlearn as well as the new things we need to learn, therebyallowing us to plan and manage the change. In planning culture changes, it is critical to recognize that many of the elements thatconstitute our professional culture are a source of strength. These positive aspects of our culture will help us change the dimen-sions that need changing. 21The robust cul- ture of medicine includes countless praiseworthy elements such as altruism,TABLE 2.

We are motivated by the needsof our patients and what is best for them. We are deeply committed to supporting our col- leagues. We believe in the biomedical basisof disease, including mental disorders, and are fervently against stigmatizing health con- ditions. Although we believe in being heroichealers, we also have a foundational belief in humility. We know some of our current ap- proaches are wrong and we are dedicated toobjectively testing interventions and using evidence to re ne them. The distress and burnout created by select professional norms and certain aspects of the practice environ- ment run counter to these deeply heldvalues, and it is these values that will help us reform those aspects of our professional and organizational cultures that requirechanging. Once we have identi ed the future state to which we aspire in speci c behavioral terms, we must decrease learning anxiety by creating psychological safety for the peo- ple and organizations who will have to learnnew things. 21We will have to identify new collaborative strategies and tactics for physi- cians and leaders to gain experience withnew modes of working, group dynamics, and different organizational norms. 21,52We must provide formal training opportunitiesand the time and resources to participate for leaders, groups, and teams. We will need positive role models (individuals,leaders, and organizations) who help show what the new way looks like. We will need practice elds that allow units to try new ap- proaches to work, along with advisors and coaches to help them be successful. We will need new systems, structures, controls,rewards, and processes consistent with desired changes. 21Although the learners do not always get to choose the goal, theymust have some control of the process of learning and how they will achieve the goal. 52,54Bidirectional communication be- tween leaders and learners throughout this process is critical to ensure that the vision of the future state is clear and that the con-cerns or reservations of the learners areunderstood and appreciated. Although this inclusive approach is slower, such involve- ment is critical to implementing and inter-nalizing the new norms and values and incorporating them into the existing culture. When it comes to improving physician well-being, all of these steps have already begun (Table 3 ). It is important to recognize that once a culture is mature, it can only be purposefully changed through \"managed evolution. \" 21 This means that some beliefs and values have to be deliberately dropped, some new ones adopted, and some transformed. The hardest part of this process is to come to terms with the present culture, which is taken for granted. Therefore, in diagnosingthe present culture and identifying the po- tential areas of change, it is important to create a temporary parallel learning structureto both design the future and assess the pre- sent. A parallel learning structure involves a group within the culture developing andtesting a new approach. Some member(s) (individuals, work units, divisions/depart- ments, or organizations) within the culturemust separate and be exposed to new ways of thinking, allowing an objective assess- ment of the strengths and weakness of thecurrent approach, as well as learning new ways of behaving and thinking. 21This may involve scanning the environment for solu-tions that can be adopted or \"trial and error learning. \"New solutions in the parallel sys- tem can then illustrate for the rest of the or-ganization (or to other organizations) how the new way can work and help de ne what it looks like. This decreases learninganxiety for the rest of the group and encour- ages those who continue to resist change to adapt or leave. Pilot studies, phased initia-tives, or empowering one department or group to develop and test as an alternative method before scaling it more broadly arealso useful structures to facilitate learning new approaches. MANAGING THE TRANSITION For a dimension of culture to change, it is also necessary for leaders to be convinced that a change is necessary. To manage theMAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS 1562 Mayo Clin Proc. of top execu- tives and representatives of the major units of the organization plus representative stake- holders outside the organization should beconstituted as a \"change steering task force. \" This team must identify the problem and set in motion the design, planning, and imple-mentation of the next steps. The group should become part of the basic \"parallel \" structure and continue to exist throughoutthe change program and be accountable for the various interventions that are made. Top level leaders (eg, dean, chief executiveofcer, and chief medical of cer) must spearhead and remain deeply involved in this work to sponsor, support, or supplycover for the various initiatives that will arise within the different parts and levels of the organization. The steering committee must understand the dynamics of the change process and recog- nize that all forms of the assessment of the pre- sent culture as well as change proposals areinterventions in their own right and will have known and unknown consequences. If major behavioral changes or changes in beliefs andvalues are envisioned, it becomes essential for this planning group to involve the individ- uals who will become targets of the change,because the best way to overcome learning anxiety and make the learners feel psycholog- ically safe is for them to become involved in theTABLE 3.

The rst step would typically be to \"share the problem \"by bringing together leaders of the relevant groups that would beaffected by the changes to begin dialogues around their perception of the problem and cocreate what adaptive moves might have tobe made, how the culture might aid or hinder the change, what parts of the culture would have to be evolved, and especially what the sys-temic effects would be of proposed changes. Building relationships at this level early is also a necessary investment in successfulimplementation at the later intervention stages. CONCLUSION If we are going to make substantive progress in many of the problems facing our health care delivery system and the high prevalenceof professional burnout plaguing US physi- cians, we must recognize the cultural dimen- sions to these challenges. This will requirean honest appraisal and new dialogue at the level of our profession, our health care organizations, and the health care deliverysystem. Some may say such efforts are weak- ening the profession. They incorrectly will suggest that we are overstating the depthand breadth of the cultural problem and will focus only on artifacts rather than the fundamental issues related to a lack of trustin physicians and economic assertions that view physicians as units of production. They will suggest that attending to self-care, acknowledging human limitations, and cultivating self-compassion mean advo- cating for lower standards, less commitment,and coddling of physicians and physicians in training. This predictable learning anxiety and the path to overcoming it to make mean-ingful progress are described in the system- atic approach outlined above. It is time for an honest look in the mirror and beginningthe important work to heal the culture of medicine for the bene t of our patients, our colleagues, and our profession.
