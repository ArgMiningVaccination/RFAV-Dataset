The Federal Government and the Department of Energy (Department or DOE) are committed to addressing essential work requirements and reentering employees saf ely to the workplace consistent with best public health practices. The Department's paramount concern is the health and safety of all Federal employees, contractors, and individuals interacting with the Federal workforce. As set forth in the January 20, 20 21, Executive Order 13991 \" Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask -Wearing, \" the policy of the Administration is \"to halt the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by relying on the best available data and science -based public health measures\". This Framework has been developed in accordance with relevant orders and guidance, including: the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-21-15, COVID -19 Safe Federal Workplace: Agency Model Safety Principles , issued January 24, 2021; M-21-25, Integrating Planning for a Safe Increased Return of Federal Employees and Contractors to Physical Workplaces with Post -Reentry Personne l Policies and Work Environment , issued June 10, 2021; Safer Federal Workforce Task Force COVID -19 Workplace Safety: Agency Model Safety Principles , updated September 13, 2021; Executive Order 14042, Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors , signed on September 9, 2021, E xecutive Order 14043, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees , signed September 9, 2021, and relevant court orders; guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force; updated U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines; and other federal guidance. This Framework outlines the requirements to protect the health and safety of the workforce for a safe reentry to DOE Federal facilities as well as the reentry schedule for the safe accomplishment of the DOE mission in a COVID -19 environment. The Framework is a living document that will be updated as needed to account for changing COVID -19 conditions, Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, Exceptions and CDC guidelines. Scope and Applicability This Framework replaces the DOE COVID -19 Workplace Safety Framework , revised on June 13 , 2022, and provides overall DOE requirements and guidance for associated site/facility plans. DOE will update site/facility plans as appropriate to ensure compliance with this overarching COVID -19 Workplace Safety and Reentry Framework. The safety principles in this Framework document apply to Federal employees, contractors, and any others entering or working at DOE sites/facilities. The principles presented here establish a minimum level for workplace safety and are developed from current CDC guidance and established public health best practices, based on evolving understanding of the pandemic. These principles will be reassessed over time, as conditions warrant. This document is not meant to be exhaustive, and additional program or site/facility controls will b e developed as needed. Site/Facility safety and reentry plans will build upon these principles and be tailored as appropriate for mission requirements and facility status and will be reviewed by the cognizant DOE Departmental Element. DOE conduct ed an orde rly reentry to the workplace where employees return ed in waves to the physical workplace. During this process, Federal employees continue d to work under their current work schedules until directed to return to the physical workplace aligned with the timefr ame for their position's work category as set forth in this document. Departmental Elements will continue to use the guidelines in this 4 | Page document to refine their plans and prepare sites for the workforce who will return onsite in the future . For DOE Headqua rters, the Office of Management and the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer are responsible for reviewing and updating the plan for the National Capitol Region (NCR). This Plan applies to all DOE elements within the NCR. For DOE sites that have Manag ement and Operating (M&O) or prime contractors that have previously developed and implemented site/facility plans, these plans will be updated accordingly, and each cognizant DOE Departmental Element will review these plans, as appropriate. Departmental El ements are expected to satisfy applicable Federal collective -bargaining and labor -management relations obligations before finalizing site/facility plans. For DOE sites/facilities outside of the NCR that are not co -located with M&O or other prime contracto rs, each site/facility will either review and update its existing plan or develop a site -specific plan if one does not exist. The cognizant DOE Departmental Element will review these plans. COVID -19 Coordination Team On January 20, 2021, DOE established a COVID -19 Coordination Team that reports directly to the Secretary of Energy through the DOE Chief of Staff. This executive leadership team represents the complex -wide components of DOE and keeps Heads of Departmental Elements (HDEs) and other DOE leadersh ip apprised of issues. Departmental Elements maintain line management authority and are responsible for monitoring site/facility plans and considering potential changes to site/facility plans to remain in compliance with any revisions to this Framework or other new guidance. The COVID -19 Coordination Team is responsible for establishing, implementing, and monitoring compliance with the health and safety requirements specified in this Framework as well as coordinating with appropriate agency programmatic and acquisition staff regarding the application of safety protocols to contractor employees. The team meets regularly to review this Framework and to consider potential revisions and updates based on emerging guidance and any other operational needs. Decisions are coordinated with cognizant site security officials, as appropriate. For privately owned facilities leased by the Federal Government, the team coordinates with the General Services Administration (GSA), where appropriate, and the lessor's designated r epresentative. Principles The health and safety of DOE Federal and contractor employees are of paramount importance and guide all actions for employees to reenter DOE facilities. The Department will utilize telework and flexible work schedules consistent with the principles set forth in OMB Memorandum M -21-25. This Framework aligns with the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force's model safety principles and will be revised, as necessary, to account for any superseding or additional guidance. CDC -recommended practices, including enhanced entrance screening, social distancing, and workplace protocols as outlined on Workplaces and Businesses | COVID -19 | CDC , will be used, as practical and appropriate, to lower risk. Where a locality has imposed additional pandemic -related requirements more protective than those set forth in this Framework, those requirements should be followed in DOE buildings, in DOE -controlled indoor worksites, and on DOE land in that locality. Plans and protocols will consider contingencies to prepare for potential new developments. The Department will use CDC guidelines and monitor the COVID -19 Community Levels to reassess and inform decisions as conditions warr ant. 5 | Page Executive Order 14043 requires Federal employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 regardless of the employee's duty location or work arrangement (e.g., telework, remote work), subject to such exceptions as required by law . At this time , Executi ve Order 14043 is subject to a preliminary nationwide injunction. Although this injunction may ultimately be supplemented, modified, or vacated, depending on the course of ongoing litigation, the Federal Government will take no action at this time to imple ment or enforce Executive Order 14043's requirement that employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Approach to Reentry In addition to ensuring the health and safety of DOE Federal and contractor employees, DOE's approach to reentry and the post -reentry work environment is focused on mission accomplishment and sustainability. The approach incorporates values to shape a future workplace that achieves a reduced carbon footprint, improves recruitment and retention, reduces facility costs, and cr eates a better work - life balance without negatively impacting mission delivery. DOE is committed to creating a flexible and agile workforce that is better able to respond to local and world events and that highlights DOE's core values and principles of di versity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. DOE site decisions will consider the impact on local communities. Taking into account the evolving future work environment, DOE conduct ed an orderly reentry to the workplace through a phased return to the physical workplace by Federal employees. To facilitate this process, this Framework outline d the timeframes for Federal employees to reenter the physical workplace based on the work category and key duties of an employee's position as defined below. Site/Facility contractors coordinate d with local DOE offices in the development of their specific reentry plans, which are to be aligned with the principles and requirements of this Framework. The COVID -19 pandemic forced changes to our workplace. Many DOE employees and contractors have learned how to perform the functions of their job in a new way during a difficult time, meeting the challenges head- on. DOE has demonstrated that we have been abl e to carry out our missions effectively. Accordingly, we now have an opportunity to revisit how we were operating prior to the pandemic and leverage lessons learned during the pandemic to integrate telework and remote work into our workforce plans. As we look to the future, DOE is encouraging programs to strategically leverage workplace flexibilities such as telework, remote work, and alternative/flexible work schedules as tools to help attract, recruit, and retain the best possible workforce. Reentry and Position Work Categories This Framework is informed by the feedback gathered from our workforce through varied means, including a Department -wide Federal employee survey, listening sessions, COVID -19 Coordination Team Office Hours, and input and collaboration with our union partners. Our approach allows DOE supervisors to determine the right mix of onsite and telework work for their offices based on their mission needs and in accordance with DOE's values. DOE recognizes that many employees may be authorize d to telework a greater percentage of their time post -reentry than they did before the COVID -19 outbreak based on the experience gained during this pandemic. At this time, Federal positions at DOE are divided into three main work categories: Site Critical: Most or all key duties must be performed onsite (e.g., regular access to classified information, site safety and security activities), including onsite mission essential scientific research and national security activities (e.g., Primary Mission Essential Function activities). Site Flexible: Some key duties or work activities are required to be performed onsite (e.g., intermittent access to classified information, project oversight, onsite inspections, improved efficiency of mission essential work). 6 | Page Site O ptional: Most or all key duties can be performed effectively and efficiently from a remote location. Reentry for Federal Employees The Department completed its reentry to the workplace on March 14, 2022. Extenuating circumstances that prevent an employee from returning onsite are being handled on a case -by-case basis. To assist, consistent with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's determination that the COVID -19 pandemic continues to qualify for an exigency of public service , HDEs or their designee m ay temporarily exempt the requirement for telework employees to report onsite twice- in-a-pay- period, if such a schedule can be supported by mission operations. This temporary suspension applies for employees whose position has been designated as telework eligible and who will be expected to return to the DOE official worksite on a regular and recurring basis absent the COVID -19 pandemic. HDEs will be notified when this authority ends. As of February 28, 2022, routine use of Weather and Safety Leave (WSL) for non -telework eligible positions (i.e., Site Critical and Site Flexible work categories ) is no longer in effect for COVID - 19 purposes . On that date, ev acuation orders w ere rescinded, and excused absence for caregiving no longer appl ies for employees in those work categories . For the Site Optional work category, these flexibilities end ed on March 14 , 2022, when the final wave of DOE's workplace reentry w as completed. Please note WSL may continue to be needed on a very limi ted basis as outlined in this Framework. DOE will formally assess the effectiveness of its workplace flexibilities, including telework and remote work, within one year after reentry is complete to inform DOE's Future of Work planning. Vaccinations Vaccinations are the most effective tool we possess to protect public health, the health of our workforce, and DOE's ability to accomplish its critical work during this pandemic. To promote the safety of the workforce, in accordance with applicable law and collective bargaining obligations, Federal employees are strongly encouraged to be fully vaccinated to conduct work or business at a Federal site. In implementing Executive Order s 14042 and 14043, the Department will comply with all relevant court orders, including following relevant OMB and Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance. Federal Employees In connection with recent court orders that have been entered concerning EO 14043, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees , signed on S eptember 9, 2021, the Department will continue to strongly encourage all Federal employees to be vaccinated but is not enforcing a requirement for vaccines. As of the date of this plan, Federal employees will not be required to provide proof of vaccination status . This may be revisited depending on court decisions or future CDC guidance . Covered Contractor and Subcontractor Employees In connection with court orders that have been entered concerning Executive Order 14042, Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors , DOE may not attempt to add a clause implementing requirements of the Executive Order into newly awarded (awarded, option exercised, renewed) contracts and contract -like instruments if the work under such a contract is performed entirely in a U.S. state or outlying area subject to the court order. For existing contractors or contract -like instruments that contain the clause, DOE has notified contractor s that it will take no action to enforce the clause implementing requirements of Executive Order 14042, absent further written notice from DOE, where the place of performance identified in the contract is in a U.S state or outlying area subject to a 7 | Page court order prohibiting the application of requirements pursuant to the Executive Order. These requir ements may be subject to future change depending on the outcome of ongoing litigation and the receipt of updated guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. In implementing Executive Order 14042, the Department will comply with all relevant court orders, including following relevant OMB and Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance . Vaccination Status In accordance with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, the Department considers Federal employees, contractor employees, and visitors fully vaccinated for COVID -19 two weeks after they have received the requisite number of doses of a COVID -19 vaccine approved or authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration or that has been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. For Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca/Oxford, Novavax fully vaccinated is 2 weeks after an employee has received the second dose in a 2 -dose series. For Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen, fully vaccinated is 2 weeks after an employee has received a single dose. The CDC recommends that employees stay \" up to date \" with vaccin ations which includes booster shots. Should the Safer Federal Workforce Taskforce update thei r definition of fully vaccinated, DOE will follow th eir recommendation. Please note that the CDC updated their vaccination guidance to include those who are \"up to date\" with the vaccine requirements and includes a booster shot. Vaccine -Related Leave Fully Vaccinated Federal employees are strongly encouraged to be fully vaccinated. However, due to the injunction, the time an employee spends obtaining any COVID -19 vaccination doses (including travel time) is covered under administrative leave , not duty time . In most circumstances, DOE authorizes employees to take up to four hours to travel to the vaccination site, complete any required vaccination dose, and return to work \u2014for example, up to eight hours of administrative time for employees receiving two doses. If an employee needs to spend less time getting the vaccine, only the needed amount of adm inistrative leave should be granted. DOE requires employees taking longer than four hours to document the reasons for the additional time (e.g., they may need to travel long distances to get the vaccine). If, due to unforeseen circumstances, the employee is unable to obtain the vaccine during basic tour of duty hours, the normal overtime hours of work rules apply. Booster Shots Federal employees will be granted up to four hours of administrative leave to receive any authorized COVID -19 vaccine booster shot, if they are eligible to receive such a booster shot, or any authorized additional dose of COVID -19 vaccine. The administrative leave will cover the time it takes to travel to the vaccination site, receive the vaccination dose, and return to w ork. Because there is currently no requirement for Federal employees to receive a vaccine booster shot or additional dose, the use of duty time is not allowable in these instances. Recovery from Vaccine Federal employees will be granted up to 2 workdays of administrative leave if an employee has an adverse reaction to any COVID -19 vaccination dose, including a booster shot, that prevents the employee from working (i.e., no more than 2 workdays for reactions associated with a single dose). If an employee requests more than 2 workdays to recover , the employee may take other appropriate leave (e.g., sick leave) to cover any additional absence. 8 | Page Accompanying a Family Member Federal employees will be granted up to 4 hours of administrative leave per dose to accompany a family member (as defined in OPM's leave regulations, see 5 CFR 630.201) who is receiving any COVID -19 vaccination dose. DOE grants leave -eligible employees up to four hours of administrative leave per dose \u2014for example, up to a total of twelve hours of leave for a family member receiving three doses \u2014for each family member the employee accompanies. If an employee needs to spend less time accompanying a family member who is receiving the COVID -19 vaccine, DOE grants only the needed amount of administrative leave. Employees should obtain advance approval from their supervisor before being permitted to use administrative leave for COVID -19 vaccination purposes. Employees are not credited with administrative leave or overtime work for time spent outsi de their tour of duty helping a family member get vaccinated. This policy applies to covered vaccinations received after July 29, 2021. Additional Health and Safety Requirements The Department follows CDC guidance and will implement updated guidance as it becomes available. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, DOE will continue to take a measured, methodical approach in implementing new guidance as it is issued. Taking into account the diversity of DOE's mission objectives and operations, the following requirements set the minimum threshold for health and safety and must be included in all site/facility plans. Where DOE has sites/facilities in the same geographic region but are managed by different DOE Departmental Elements, Fed eral officials shall coordinate as practicable. In the event the health and safety information in the Framework conflicts with CDC guidance, the CDC guidance will always supersede the Departmental guidance and apply automatically without the need for changes in the Framework. Community Levels at DOE Sites When applying COVID -19 workplace safety protocols , DOE sites should reference the CDC COVID -19 Community Levels t o determine appropriate steps . Sites should use the county where the Site/Facility is located to determ ine the community level . For Headquarters facilities, Washington, DC and Montgomery County, MD will be used as appropriate to determine Community Levels. Where a locality imposes more protective pandemic -related safety requirements, those requirements are followed by DOE employees and onsite contractor employees, in DOE buildings, in DOE controlled indoor worksites, and on DOE lands within that locality. The following masking requirements will continue to apply to all DOE sites and other facilities owned or leased by the Department based on the CDC Community Levels: COVID -19 Community Level Mask Wearing Physical Distancing LOW Optional None MEDIUM Optional Encouraged to m aintain distance from others and avoid crowding HIGH Required Encouraged to m aintain distance from others and avoid crowding 9 | Page Face Masks Site/Facility plans, including the plan for the NCR , will outline specific protocols for wearing masks , as stipulated by the CDC Community Level . When masks are required, employees, contractors, and visitors must wear high- quality masks or respirators (e.g., surgical masks, N95s, KN95s). Unfiltered cloth masks are not permitted . In Government -operated vans, cars, trucks, and other motor pool passenger vehicles, Federal employees are required to wear masks when there are multiple occupants . Importantly, i ndividuals may choose to wear a mask regardless of the COVID -19 Community Level. Screening In accordance with the guidance released by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force on February 28, 2022 and updated on August 12, 2022, the Department will no longer conduct screening testing based on locality transmission rates or vaccination status. DOE Sites/facilities may continue to conduct previously implemented serial screening testing of individual employees where there is no differentiation based on their COVID -19 vaccination status depending on their job functions and work environment. New screening testing programs should not be implemented pending further guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force . All tests will be proctored. Testing may be made available to DOE Federal employees and onsite support service contractors who may have been exposed while on official government business or while on official government travel. Contact Tracing In accordance with CDC and Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, c onta ct tracing is not required. When Sites /facilities perform contact tracing , it should be handled in accordance with CDC guidelines to help identify, track, and manage work -related close contacts of COVID -19 cases. Site contact tracing should be done in collaboration with, and in support of the contact tracing programs of local health departments, as applicable. Site/Facility Workplace Safety plans should include site procedures and protocols to implement infection control and workplace safety efforts once i nformed of a case of COVID - 19, as appropriate . Disclosures of COVID -19 cases should be made to local public health officials as required or necessary to provide for the public health and safety of DOE employees and contractors in accordance with local publ ic health mandates. COVID -19 Reporting Programs and sites will continue to follow established protocols for reporting the status of COVID cases to the DOE COVID -19 Hotline (or a field office or agency component designee) . The numbers of onsite active confirmed cases (those cases where an individual has been onsite in the 10 days prior to onset of symptoms or testing positive or within the 5 days after onset of symptoms or testing positi ve), including total confirmed cases (since March 2020), and deaths shall be reported every Monday. All deaths associated with COVID -19 must be reported to the DOE COVID -19 Hotline within one business day. An anonymized summary narrative will be requested for each death associated with COVID -19. Sites may use the COVID -19 Hotline's application to track cases at their site. To promote transparency and safety, sites will notify their workforce about confirmed COVID cases, as relevant and appropriate, consiste nt with local and Federal privacy and confidentiality regulations and laws. Depending on the circumstances and such factors as the size of the site, notifications will be made by contacting individuals or by issuing broader messages. In addition, anonymize d data on the DOE -wide total number of confirmed cases as well as the number of confirmed cases at each site is available to the 10 | Page workforce on the Department's COVID -19 Powerpedia Portal. Travel The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force has issued extensive t ravel guidance that is located at Travel | Safer Federal Workforce . This includes but is not l imited to guidance if a Federal employee develops probable or confirmed COVID -19 while on official or local travel and if a Federal employee has come in close contact with someone who has confirmed COVID -19 while on official or local travel. Regardless of vaccination status, Federal and contractor employees cannot go on official travel if they have a n active case of COVID -19. Federal and contractor employees are to adhere strictly to CDC, state, and local guidelines before, during, and after travel, regardless of whether the travel is personal or for official business. The CDC has provided guidance on travel for fully vaccinated people . Federal and contractor employees , regardless of vaccination status, can go on official travel using the normal organizational approval processes . Official domestic and international travel for Federal and contractor employees will be conducted in accordance with applicable CDC guidance and the January 21, 2021, Executive Order Promoting COVID -19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel . Approval for travel varies when Federal and contractor employees have had a known close contact with someone who has COVID -19: If Federal and contractor employees are not \" up to date \" with vaccination requirements and are recommended to quarantine for 5 days after the close contact , official travel cannot be approved for the 5 days after the close contact pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance . Please see the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force FAQs on travel f or additional guidance on how to proceed regarding approval to travel on days 6 - 10. If Federal and contractor employees are \"up to date \" with vaccination requirements and therefore not recommended by the CDC to quarantine after exposure but have not had confirmed COVID -19 within the previous 90 days, only mission critical travel may be approved during days 1 - 5 after the close contact. Any official travel may be approved through the normal organizational approval processes to travel on days 6 - 10 provid ed the individual tests negative no more than 1 day before travel and wears a high- quality mask when around others for the duration of the travel that falls within the 10 days after the last close contact. If Federal and contractor employees are \"up to date \" with vaccination requirements and therefore not recommended by the CDC to quarantine after exposure and have had confirmed COVID -19 within the previous 90 days , any official travel may be approved through the normal organizational approval processes to travel on days 1 - 10 provided the individual wears a high- quality mask when around others for the duration of the travel that falls within the 10 days after the last close contact . For domestic travel, Federal employees follow CDC guidance in addition to other Federal, state, Tribal, and local requirements during travel. They must also monitor their symptoms and i f symptoms develop, they must isolate themselves, notify their physician, and follow their site requirements for notification. For international travel, prior to arrival in the United States, all air passengers coming to the United States, including U.S. citizens and fully vaccinated people, are required to follow CDC guidance before they board a flight to the United States. Official Government travelers may use their t ravel card for payment of COVID -19 tests recommended or required prior to or following travel. The travel costs for required COVID tests may be reimbursed as a miscellaneous travel expense. If a traveler cannot use the travel card due to a blockage on the card, the traveler can be reimbursed via the travel voucher, with a receipt for the test. 11 | Page Symptom Monitoring If Federal employees, contractors, or visitors are not feeling well, they are not to enter the Federal workplace. Site/Facility plans must ensure procedures and processes are in place requiring Federal and contractor employees working on site to complete screening for symptoms (e.g., a symptom questionnaire, a temperature check, self -verification of entry requirements) upon entry to the workplace. Visitors may also be asked to complete symptom screening before entering a DOE facility. Entry screening may be self -screening or administered in- person by the site contractor or DOE office. Individuals are encouraged to monitor themselves for the development of symptoms. Any individua l who develops any symptoms consistent with COVID -19 during the workday, even if fully vaccinated, must immediately isolate, notify their supervisor, and promptly leave the workplace. Isolation Effective August 2022, CDC updated its quarantine and isolation guidance and removed the requirement to quarantine after an exposure to COVID -19. Any individual , who is per the CDC guidelines due to COVID symptoms or testing positive , will not be allowed onsite consistent with and in compliance with local laws and regulations. Individuals will also need to follow CDC guidelines with respect to travel , mask wearing , and getting tested . Individuals should contact their health care provider and follow their instructions, if different than the CDC guidelines . Unless advised otherwise by a health care provider, health department official, or site occupational medical official, a person with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 may return to work in accordance with the CDC guidelines. Any individual who has been exposed to someone who has COVID -19 or has been exposed to someone who tested positive does not need to quarantine, but must follow the CDC guidelines for exposure . If the exposure is potentially work -related, an individual must follow the site guidelines for reporting COVID -19 cases and/or work- related accidents, injuries, and illnesses. On- site testing may be available. Leave Related to Close Contacts, Isolation, and Travel The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force has issued extensive leave guidance for Federal employees related to close contacts , isolation, and travel that can be found at Leave | Safer Federal Workforce . In all situations, Federal employees who are eligible to telework and are subject to CDC isolation requirements will be required to take leave or telework for the duration of the CDC isolation period before they are allowed to return to the workplace, as well as follow any applicable testing guidance. Federal employees who are not telework eligible must work with t heir management on an appropriate work status for the duration of the CDC isolation period to mitigate impacts to the mission of their office to the greatest extent possible; otherwise, WSL is provided. Federal employees are reminded that m aking a false st atement to the Department regarding close contact , quarantine or isolation matters could result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal service. DOE may ask for additional information if necessary to confirm notification of a close contact, including if there is reason to believe the employee requested leave under false pretenses. If requested, DOE will comply any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If an employee is subject to CDC solation and the employee is unable to telework because they are too sick to telework, or the employee is ineligible for telework and is sick, weather and safety leave cannot be used. Employees request may use sick leave or may also request accrued annual leave and other forms of paid or unpaid leave in this situation as appropriate. Confidentiality When providing information to the workforce on confirmed COVID -19 cases, the Department must 12 | Pagebalance the privacy rights of the individual diagnosed with COVID -19 with the need to openly communicate with the workforce. All medical information collected from personnel, including vaccination information, test results, and any other information obtained as a result of testing and symptom monitoring, will be treated confidentially in accordance with applicable law, and accessible only by those with a need to know in order to protect the health and safety of personnel. The DOE COVID -19 Hotline Response Team will direct all questions re lating to personal medical data to an appropriate point of contact. Generally, in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act, and with privacy laws, managers and supervisors may not specifically disclose the identity of an individual who has or may have COVID -19 or provide information, such as the specific location of the individual's workstation, which will allow other employees to identify the individual. Supervisors may ask the individual for consent to share their identity information with those whom they have been in close contact. Even if an individual consents to such disclosure, identifying information is only to be provided to those who have a need to know. The COVID -19 Hotline Response Team or the site individuals who are performing contact tracing will work with managers and supervisors to verbally (vice email) notify coworkers who may have been in close contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID -19 to provide these employees more information to help when monitoring themselves for signs or symptoms and quarantining themselves, if appropriate. Again, the information provided about any individual's health should be minimized as much as possible. Workplace Operations Planning and Preparation The Department will continue to follow CDC, OSHA, and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidelines applicable to the Federal workplace. The principles presented here establish a minimum level for workplace safety and are aligned to current CDC guidance and established public health best practices, based on evolving understanding of the pandemic. Principles will be reassessed over time, as conditions warrant, and as new guidance is issued. This document is not meant to be exhaustive, and additional program or site/facility controls will be developed as needed. Site/Facility plans should align with these principles to the extent possible but may be adjusted as appropriate for mission requirements and changing CDC or public health guidance. In addition, sites should incorporate location specific plans to appropriately reorient returning workers to site operations considering items such as: Emergency procedures and responsibilities Facility orientation to include COVID controls General employee training and specific safety and health training (e.g., HAZWOPR, Radiological Training, Respiratory Protection) Job specific proficiency needs and training Office information technology readiness Physical Distancing In accordance with CDCs guidance , and consistent with guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, Federal employees, contractors, and visitors entering or working inside or on the grounds of a DOE site/facility are no longer required to maintain a physical distance of at least six feet in DOE buildings or in DOE leased spaces, except where called for by Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations. Floor markings, one -way walkways, reconfiguration of workspaces or office assignments, and 13 | Pageother mitigation strategies may continue to be implemented to minimize interactions. In addition, consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, when Community Levels are at MEDIUM or HIGH, signage will be posted in DOE facilities encouraging individuals, regardless of vaccination status, to consider physically distancing themselves from others and avoiding crowding in indoor c ommon areas, meeting rooms, and high- risk settings while onsite . Environmental Cleaning Enhanced cleaning in common use/high touch/high density spaces, such as lobbies, restrooms, elevators, and stairwells will continue to be performed. Office space tha t is in regular use will be cleaned regularly, and in accordance with CDC guidelines. Wipes, gloves, and EPA -approved disinfectants will continue to be made available for individuals to wipe down their workstation and related personal property. Physical barriers such as plexiglass shields may continue to be used where appropriate. In accordance with CDC and GSA guidelines, if a person who has tested positive for COVID -1 9 has been in a facility within the last 24 hours, the spaces occupied by that person should be cleaned and disinfected unless it will not be occupied for the subsequent 3 days. If more than 24 hours has passed since the person has been in the space, regular cleaning is sufficient. If more than 3 days have passed since the person was in the space, no additional cleaning is necessary. Judgement should be used in identifying the appropriate scope of the cleaning and in cleaning industrial and radiological work areas. Site/Facility plans must ensure procedures and process are in place that determine the scope of any w orkplace or area closures related to cleaning and disinfecting requirements. Hygiene Hand sanitizer stations will continue to be available at building entrances and throughout workspaces, and must contain hand sanitizer, with at least 60 percent alcohol and be manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DOE sites should ensure that the hand sanitizer is not on the FDA's do not use list . Personnel are encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer or alcohol - based hand rubs frequently. To reinforce the importance of hygiene, signage is required at all DOE sites/facilities. Each Site/Facility plan must have procedures and proce sses for disinfecting shared tools, equipment, and common work surfaces (e.g., workbenches, laboratory spaces, desks). Disinfectant wipes will continue to be provided by the DOE or the contractor, as appropriate. Ventilation and Air Filtration To the maxi mum extent feasible, and with consideration of current guidance from the CDC , indoor ventilation will be optimized to increase the proportion of outdoor ventilation, improve filtration, and reduce or eliminate recirculation. Where technically practicable, and depending on the availability of funds, continued action will be taken to improve engineering controls such as improving Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) filter efficiency ratings and sealing of filters. Space heaters, desk fans and other devices that provide air movement inside a space are to be eliminated to the extent practicable. If needed, work should be relocated to room/buildings with better ventilati on characteristics. Visitors Areas open to the general public must post signs indicating any requirements for wearing masks when in the area. Visitors must comply with all relevant CDC guidance, including wearing a mask, when appropriate .

In-person attendees in areas of HIGH Community Levels m ust wear a high- quality mask in public indoor settings. Regardless of Community Levels, Departmental Elements cannot collect vaccination information or require proof of negative COVID -19 tests for meeting attendees. Elevators Assessments will continue to be performed to determine the safe occupancy level of elevators to ensure social distancing, and signage detailing the requirements will be posted near the entrances. The use of stairs by those who are physically able is strongly encouraged. Signage has been posted to explain current procedures. Shared Spaces Assessments will continue to be performed to determine the safe occupancy level of shared spaces such as elevators, conference rooms, auditoriums, and cafeterias and the requirements will be posted near the entrances. Other visual markers will be installed to promote physical distancing within common spaces, and furniture should be removed. DOE COVI D-19 Hotline Response Team The DOE COVID -19 Hotline Response Team protocols will be used across the DOE complex for handling reports of COVID -like symptoms and confirmed cases. Field sites will be responsible for following established DOE -wide protocols, a nd where applicable, managing the site/facility cases, and providing recommendations to site staff. Field sites will report the status of their onsite confirmed cases and occupancy to the DOE COVID -19 Hotline Response Team in weekly status updates every Mo nday. Information may be entered directly into the COVID System Metrics (CSM) application. For DOE HQ, the COVID -1 9 Hotline Response Team will triage potential onsite cases and follow up on cases at Headquarters. The COVID -19 Hotline is available for repo rting cases as well as for answering questions. The COVID -19 Hotline can be reached by calling at COVID -1 9inquiries@hq.doe.gov . Emails with personal information should be sent using Entrust. "}
