The fall timing of the first trial raised the question of whether this symptomatic improvement might have been attributed to cooler temperatures. But women who began the study as weather warmed up in the spring had the same benefit, ruling out the effect of outside temperature. \"These new results suggest that a diet change should be considered as a first-line treatment for troublesome vasomotor symptoms, including night sweats and hot flashes,\" explains Dr. Barnard. Included in the [study](https://pcrm.widencollective.com/portals/mhyjnmns/WAVSMediaResources) were 84 postmenopausal women reporting two or more hot flashes per day. They were randomly assigned either to an intervention group\u2014consisting of a low-fat, vegan diet, including half a cup of cooked soybeans daily\u2014or to a control group that made no diet changes for 12 weeks. Intervention study participant [Margo LaMarsh](https://pcrm.widencollective.com/portals/mhyjnmns/WAVSMediaResources) says of the changes she experienced during the trial, \"The hot flashes were less frequent, and they were also less intense. I no longer had to change pajamas in the middle of the night due to sweating. The diet made me feel so much better. I have so much more energy, my skin is clearer, and I lost 20 pounds in 12 weeks.\" The researchers took advantage of technology, using a cellphone app to track the frequency and severity of hot flashes in real time, electronic questionnaires to track other symptoms, and self-calibrating digital scales to track weight changes. \"This [study](https://pcrm.widencollective.com/portals/mhyjnmns/WAVSMediaResources) demonstrates the effectiveness of a dietary intervention for menopausal symptoms,\" Dr. Barnard explains. \"As well, it is precisely the diet that would be expected to reduce the health concerns of many women reaching menopause: an increasing risk of heart disease, breast cancer, and memory problems.\" Her Hot Flashes Started Going Away In 10 Days Media Contact Leslie Raabe 202-527-7319 lraabe[at]pcrm.org Founded in 1985, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization that promotes preventive medicine, conducts clinical research, and encourages higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in education and research.
