At the end of the day we can feel scattered, stressed, and worn down. Over time we can carry a lot of stress and may adopt unhealthy habits as coping mechanisms. Although we are more digitally connected than ever before, we are increasingly disconnected from our peace of mind. Perhaps it's time for a mental and spiritual cleanse! In this day of silence and guided meditation you will find the space and time to truly de-stress and connect with inner peace within a like-minded community. To help you remain in this mindset for the day, a vegan lunch will be available for everyone so you can stay within the center grounds and in the spirit of retreat, and gain maximum benefit from this special event. Join us for a uniquely purifying and meaningful experience and let go of the noise of distracting thoughts.
