The energy is entirely different with everything being so fast and intense. Everybody is in a hurry to be something, go somewhere or get something done. It can get crazy and in the midst of the insanity, one can lose their spiritual center sometimes. Firstly, remember that it will sometimes be a challenge to find balance and hence lower your expectations regarding your spiritual goals. Dealing with the daily grind can be too much for all of us, so try to relax and be flexible even when you seem to lose control. 2) Take the Stress out While many people around us go on with their busy lives with a sense of pride and wear their anxiety as a badge of honor, it's extremely important to address stress and find the way to get it out of our system. Some people try journaling to face their thoughts, while others turn negative energy into fuel by indulging in [exercises to bring balance](https://centracare.org/florida/blog/2017/01/09/exercises-improve-balance/) on both physical and spiritual levels. Other activities like drawing, cooking, and de-cluttering are also known to help. 3) Be in the Arms of Nature Going outdoors and feeling the elements, regardless of the lack of nature, is essential. It's believed that human beings feel better spiritually when engaged with the natural elements than when they sit around all day. The weather is one feature of the natural environment that is always accessible even in a big city. Relish it! It's also effective to own pets and have plants fill our houses as they also contribute to making us feel connected and refreshed. 4) Do Slow Activities It takes some time to practice becoming slower. The finest thing for you to do when feeling out of balance is to grab a relevant book and read, go for long walks in a quiet area minus the mobile phone. You can also meditate or call a loved one over to talk about your feelings or things that really matter to you. This can help instantly in feeling more connected to your spiritual side. The movement of energy away from technology is very serene and renewing. Swap a \"fast\" activity, like watching movies or surfing the Internet, for one \"slow\" one and feel the difference yourself. 5) Reevaluate Your Social Circle It is truly vital to discover like-minded people in the city. It's also significant to identify that there might be certain people in your life that are dragging you down or colliding with your balance. These can be people who are constantly complaining about their lives while wasting it away on drugs and alcohol. It can also be people who are always angry, in a hurry or in a bad mood. They might even be your friends! But if being away from them for a short while makes you feel calmer, more balanced and in sync with yourself then maybe you need to stop spending your time with them. Weeding out things that don't serve you well in life and moving towards more grounding and connected experiences goes a long way in finding that balance which helps you live optimally.
