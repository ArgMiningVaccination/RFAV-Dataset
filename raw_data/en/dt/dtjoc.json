Keep reading to find out why conventional body lotion stinks and why I recommend making the switch to a natural body lotion STAT! Plus learn how to find the best body lotion for YOU - whether you have dry skin, dehydrated skin or any other skin concerns! 3 Reasons to Switch to a Non-Toxic Body Lotion When it comes to choosing a body lotion, the easiest thing to do is grab the cheapest product you can find at the drugstore, or to keep buying that same old lotion you grew up using. Body lotion can seem like a no-brainer purchase - but it should be more than that. Here's why you should make the swap to a natural, non-toxic body lotion: 1.) Avoid toxic ingredients Most body lotions are a mix of cheap chemical ingredients, some of which are linked to negative health effects like hormone disruption, allergic responses and even cancer. The filler ingredients are petroleum based instead of plant based, making them worse for the planet too. As an example, check out the ingredient list for Vaseline Aloe Soothe Body Lotion: As you can see it contains paraben preservatives (propylparaben and methylparaben), PEG compounds, artificial fragrance, mineral oil and petrolatum. It even has a California Proposition 65 warning label that it could cause cancer or birth defects. Yikes! For something that is used so frequently and over a large part of your body, you want your body lotion to be made from clean, natural ingredients, not toxic chemicals. Read up about the [top ingredients to avoid in personal care](https://mindfulmomma.com/toxic-ingredients-in-beauty-personal-care-products/) and take note of ingredients when you purchase body lotion. If you are unsure about a body lotion, you can consult the [Skin Deep database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep) for information and ideas. And read up on [how to find the safest personal care products](https://mindfulmomma.com/non-toxic-beauty/) before you shop. A note about preservatives: Any product made with water (or aloe vera), like a body lotion, must have some type of preservative in order to give it a shelf life of more than a month or so. That's because products containing water will grow mold, yeast or bacteria over time. So unfortunately, a preservative-free body lotion is not a thing. Instead, the best clean body lotion brands use a small amount of a safer preservative that will still be effective to prevent microbial growth in products. If you want to avoid preservatives altogether, try a body oil or skin balm that does not contain any water. 2.) Skip the stinky artificial fragrances Want to know why artificial fragrances stink? Because \"fragrance\" is an ingredient loophole that allows thousands of chemicals to be used without being listed on the ingredient label. Some of those synthetic fragrance ingredients could be phthalates, which are endocrine disruptors and other ingredients may cause allergic reactions. Bottom line is, when you see the term \"fragrance\" or \"parfum\" on an ingredient label, you have no idea what is in there. 3.) Natural body lotions are nicer to use I've been using natural and organic body lotions for years but every once in a while I'll use one (at a hotel or someone's house) that reminds me why I made the switch. So many body lotions have a waxy feel to them and you can tell they are just coating your skin. A high quality non-toxic body lotion will have beneficial ingredients like plant oils, natural butters and botanical extracts that absorb into your skin, helping hydrate and nourish for the long term. A great body lotion will feel smooth and silky going on, not waxy or sticky like those other lotions. And forget those heavy, artificial fragrances - a natural body lotion will be either fragrance-free or scented with natural essential oils - which is a much nicer experience in my opinion.
