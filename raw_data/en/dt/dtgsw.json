Our mission at Texas Wesleyan University is to develop students to their full potential as individuals and as members of the world community. The University is committed to the principles that each student deserves personal attention and that all members of the academic community must have freedom to pursue independent thought and to exercise intellectual curiosity. The University actively seeks and employs faculty and staff with commitment and dedication to teaching, inspiring, and serving students. Texas Wesleyan University recognizes its responsibility to the community by providing leadership and talent through programs that enable and enrich society. The University endeavors to create a learning environment where each student is provided an opportunity to pursue individual excellence, to think clearly and creatively, and to communicate effectively. The University also strives to develop a sense of civic responsibility and spiritual sensitivity, with a commitment to moral discrimination and action. Texas Wesleyan University strives to develop informed, responsible, and articulate citizens. Vision Texas Wesleyan University aspires to be a values- and student-centered university where motivated students prepare for graduate school and leadership in professional careers. This vision is premised upon the understanding that professional employers seek individuals who have attained the essential skills of critical thinking, analytical reasoning and creative problem solving. Texas Wesleyan believes that the best way for undergraduate students to learn these skills is in a liberal arts setting through intentionally small classes led by gifted faculty who are committed to student success. This vision also recognizes that most students will need graduate professional degrees to further their careers and that these same skills are required for admission to and successful completion of graduate professional programs. Realizing that most students will enter the workforce before returning to graduate school, Texas Wesleyan University will maintain graduate professional programs of high quality in formats that are accessible to working adults. These programs will focus on deepening and broadening critical thinking, analytical reasoning and creative problem solving skills in the context of professional content. Accreditation Texas Wesleyan University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral level degrees.

History Texas Wesleyan University was founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in 1890 on a site east of Fort Worth donated by area pioneers, A. S. Hall, W. D. Hall, and George Tandy. Originally named Polytechnic College, the school held its first classes in September 1891, with a handful of faculty members and 111 students. In the early 20th century, H.A. Boaz conceived the idea of a new university for Southern Methodism and planned to develop Polytechnic College into that university. When Southern Methodist University was established in Dallas, the Polytechnic campus was designated the Woman's College for Southern Methodism. Texas Woman's College, as it became in 1914, developed into a major force in North Texas. However, faced with dwindling resources during the Depression, trustees voted to close the school in 1931. A merger with the financially secure Texas Wesleyan Academy in Austin kept the doors open and created the new, co-educational institution of Texas Wesleyan College in 1934. Since then, Texas Wesleyan has remained a co- educational, liberal arts-based institution with an increasingly comprehensive academic and student life program. In addition to strong undergraduate programs, the University added graduate programs in education in the 1970s, and nurse anesthesia and graduate business programs in the 1980s. The University assumed control of the Nurse Anesthesia Program at Harris Methodist Hospital and the program, now known as the Graduate Program in Nurse Anesthesia and accredited by the Council of Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia, is the largest in the country. Recognizing the growth in programs, trustees changed the name of the institution to Texas Wesleyan University, effective in January 1989. Texas Wesleyan has historically combined service to a residential population along with its strong commitment to a commuting and adult population. To add flexibility in the scheduling of courses and to recognize the special needs of adult learners, the University added the C.E. Hyde Weekend/Evening Program in 1994. The University established a campus in downtown Fort Worth in 1997 with the relocation of the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, which was established in 1992 and is fully accredited by the American Bar Association. Texas Wesleyan continues to grow in the 21st century. The psychology department moved into its new home, the Nenetta Burton Carter Building in 2001, and a new building for the Graduate Program in Nurse Anesthesia opened in 2003. A graduate program in counseling was added in 2004. In Texas Wesleyan University 18 2005, Texas Wesleyan opened its first apartment-style dormitory for students and completed renovations of the Polytechnic United Methodist Church. In 2007, the Ed and Rae Schollmaier Science and Technology Center opened as well as the Louella Baker-Martin Pavilion. In 2008, the historic Baber Building was renovated, and Texas Wesleyan established the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice and, in 2009, the Doctor of Education. In 2010, the Claudia Stepp Scene shop opened for use by the theatre department, and the university unveiled the new Jack and Jo Willa Morton Fitness Center. The Campus Texas Wesleyan University maintains a historic campus in east Fort Worth and a downtown campus that is adjacent to the Fort Worth Convention Center and immediately across from the Water Gardens in Fort Worth. The historic campus includes more than 75 acres four miles southeast of downtown and is located on one of the highest points in the city. The heritage of Texas Wesleyan is reflected in some of the historic buildings with Georgian-style columns, while progress is seen in the contemporary design of the newer buildings. Wesleyan also has a satellite location south of Fort Worth in the city of Burleson. The downtown campus of the University is located at 1515 Commerce Street. The downtown campus houses the School of Law through which the University offers its juris doctor program. This mixture of old and new is reflected in all aspects of Texas Wesleyan University's life where new and innovative ideas complement more than a century of traditions.

Baker-Martin House (1928, moved to campus in 1996) houses the Office of Advancement. Originally located in the Riverside area of Fort Worth, it was moved to the campus in 1996. James B. Baker built the Georgian-style home across the street from his business, Baker Brothers Nursery, one of the first The University 19 nursery and landscaping operations in North Texas. The Baker family has a long history of involvement with Texas Wesleyan University. J.B. Baker served on the Board of Trustees of Polytechnic College from 1895-1913. His son, Edward L. Baker, Sr., served on the Texas Wesleyan College Board of Trustees as a member, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Chairman of the Board from 1945 until his death November 29, 1969. Edward Baker's daughter, Louella Baker Martin, is a trustee of the University. Because of her great affection and memories of the Baker-Martin home and the long- standing relationship of the family with Texas Wesleyan University, Mrs. Martin donated the home to the University.

The McCann University Professorship was established in 1996 through a bequest from the Ralph and Sue McCann Trust. The McCann University Professorship is designed to celebrate faculty strength by allowing for enhanced professional development. ROBING CEREMONY From the time this institution was founded in 1890, a strong bond has united members of the faculty with members of the student body. This close relationship has developed because of the desire of the faculty to teach more than the subject matter and because Texas Wesleyan University students have wanted to learn and understand the beliefs, philosophies, and attitudes of the instructors and professors. Throughout the more than 100 years of the University's history, it has been recognized that if the student is to receive an education and if the faculty is to maintain an appropriate perspective on that process, this relationship must exist. The Robing Ceremony, an academic convocation that had its beginning in 1927, expresses this warm and interdependent relationship between faculty and student. By asking a faculty member to vest her or him, the graduate acknowledges the importance of this crucial interpersonal process. The ceremony has made significant contribution to the rich heritage of the University; it is a vital part of the concluding activities of the student's graduate career. Graduate students eligible for graduation and thereby participation in the Robing Ceremony may select a faculty member who has been meaningful to them for vesting of the Robe at the Robing Ceremony preceding the graduation program. Persons to vest the student must be eligible to wear academic regalia. Persons eligible include all faculty, full or part-time, and staff who hold faculty rank. Texas Wesleyan University 22 GRADUATION CEREMONY\u2014SCHOOL OF LAW Each academic year, the law school acknowledges its candidates for the juris doctor degree at commencement ceremonies in December and May.

Texas Wesleyan University 44 UNIVERSITY POLICIES Academic Integrity Academic freedom is the cornerstone to a university education. It allows students to examine, learn, and synthesize various topics. Freedom is predicated on integrity, trust, and honesty. All undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff are expected to show integrity in their academic work, including discussion, written submissions, examinations, and laboratory work. Failure to conduct academic work honestly is a serious breach in trust and is considered a serious offense. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, the following: A. Cheating: The unauthorized use of materials, devices, or information on an academic exercise. Examples of cheating include submitting another's work as one's own, using unauthorized notes or electronic devices during an examination, changing or altering a score in any way, stealing an examination or answer key, or allowing another person to complete one's assignment. B. Fabrication and Falsification: The inaccurate presentation of data in an academic exercise. Examples of fabrication and falsification include creating false data for a laboratory exercise or falsifying citations of sources used. C. Facilitation and Collaboration: The unauthorized aiding of another student in her/his academic exercises or allowing another student to violate academic integrity. Examples of facilitation and collaboration include knowingly allowing another student to cheat, completing another student's academic work, or conducting group work when not allowed by a professor. D. Interference: Any act that prevents other students from completing their academic work or prevents their work from being evaluated fairly. Examples of interference include defacing library or university material in a way that prevents others from using it, defacing another's work, offering bribes or threats to influence grading of academic work, or intentionally disrupting the academic process. E. Plagiarism: The use of the words, ideas, and data of others without giving credit to that person. Examples include failing to provide proper citations for ideas, facts, opinions, theories, or statistics, or presenting these as one's own, or submitting work previously submitted to another course when not allowed by professor. University Policies 45 CONSEQUENCES OF ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT What the instructor should do when academic misconduct is suspected: 1. Have a preliminary meeting with the student to present any evidence of academic misconduct within one week of discovery of the alleged incident to determine if a violation has occurred. 2. If a violation of the academic integrity policy is determined, issue the appropriate sanction (detailed in the Sanctions section). 3. If a sanction is imposed, complete the Report Form for Allegations of Academic Dishonesty (available in the dean's office) within one week of the sanction determination. The instructor submits a copy to the student, the dean of the school, and the Dean of Students. What the student should do when accused of academic misconduct: 1. Attend the preliminary meeting with the instructor. Failure to attend this meeting is considered an additional violation. 2. Remain calm and listen to the evidence of academic misconduct being presented. 3. Present student's point of view. 4. If the instructor imposes sanctions, obtain a copy of the Report Form for Allegations of Academic Dishonesty from the instructor. 5. If sanctions are imposed and if the student disagrees with the alleged misconduct and/or the sanctions, the student may file a written appeal. A copy must be submitted to the instructor, the dean of the school, and the Dean of Students within one week of receiving the Report form for Allegations of Academic Dishonesty from the instructor. 6. Attend hearings and/or appeals as required by this policy. Unless requested by the instructor or student, there are no official hearings for first-time offenses. OFFICIAL HEARINGS AND APPEALS The University Hearing Board hears appealed cases as well as repeat, multiple, and severe allegations. The instructor or student can also request an official hearing for a first-time academic integrity violation. Hearings are conducted in the same manner as non-academic misconduct cases (detailed in sections C2a-b and 3a-b of the \"Disciplinary System (Non-Academic Matters)\" section of the Student Handbook and outlined for academic misconduct, below*). Judicial boards will strive to complete proceedings within 10 days of receipt of the report of violation. Any appeal of decisions of the University Judicial Board is made to the Provost. The student must submit a written appeal with explanation to the Provost, the instructor, the dean of the school, and the Dean of Students within 7 days of the University Judicial Board's decision. The Provost's decision is final. No grade penalty can be assigned by the instructor until the case and all appeals are resolved. If the charges cannot be resolved prior to the end of the semester, the instructor will assign the grade of \"I\" (Incomplete) until the case is resolved. SANCTIONS Sanctions for academic misconduct are intended to educate the student, change inappropriate behaviors, and assure that the severity of the sanctions Texas Wesleyan University 46 fit the misconduct. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include one or a combination of the following, at the instructor's discretion: 1. An oral reprimand; 2. A written reprimand; 3. An additional assignment to replace the work; 4. No credit given for the work; 5. Lower or failing grade for the particular assignment, exam, or course; 6.

Removal of student from the program, major, school, or University; 2. Withdrawal of the degree or academic credit bestowed; 3. Disciplinary probation (with length of time and conditions of return specified). Access to Student Records The US Dept of Education reiterates that FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) rights transfer to a student when s/he enters a postsecondary institution. Texas Wesleyan University supports this statement in regard to access to individual student academic records and will not provide record access to parents without signature of the student. A specific form (located on the website) is available for this purpose. FERPA does allow institutions to disclose information to appropriate officials in a health or safety emergency, including parents if the emergency involves their child. Texas Wesleyan reserves the right to notify appropriate officials and parents in any situation determined to be an emergency. RECORDS MAINTAINED 1. The University maintains records for each student that include name; address; student identification number; information on parents, guardian, and spouse; general information on academic status at the University; previous school data; results of standardized admissions, examinations, and courses previously taken or being taken; credits; and grades. The University Registrar is responsible for maintaining all of these records, except for those involving financial aid. These records are available to the University Registrar, the Dean of Students, the President, the Provost and Senior Vice President, the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services, the Director of Financial Aid, and to the faculty of the University. Staff members affiliated with the University may be designated as having access to the records on a need-to- know basis. The University Registrar, in consultation with the Provost and Senior Vice President, will be the individual charged with responsibility for determining the need to know. Prior consent is not required for the release of educational information under certain circumstances (such as the need to know by other school officials when a student transfers to another school, when requested by federal/state officials functioning in their official capacity, for financial aid purposes, to certain educational organizations, and in certain emergency situations). University Policies 47 2. Applicants for financial aid have an additional file that contains information submitted as part of the process of applying for financial assistance. Records involving financial aid are maintained by the Director of Financial Aid and are available to the Director and staff, the President, the Associate Vice President for Student Services, the Provost and Senior Vice President, and to the Committee on Scholarships for the purpose of granting and administering the University's financial aid programs. All of these records also are available to such other organizations and persons as are entitled to them under Part 99 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 3. The University is required to maintain records for each F-1 student (immigration classification) to whom it has issued Form I-20 A-B. The required information includes: name; date and place birth; country of citizenship; address; status (full-time or part-time); date of commencement of studies; degree program and field of study; whether the student has been certified for practical training, the address of the places of employment and dates when employed during certified practical training, and the beginning and ending dates of certification; termination date and reason; documents and information related to the student's qualifications for admission to the school as an F-1 student; number of credits completed each semester; and a photocopy of the student's I-20 ID copy. In addition the University is required to maintain records on F-1 students and their dependents: their identity and current (local) address; their nonimmigrant classification; the current academic status (including whether full- or part-time); and disciplinary actions regarding these students as a result of a criminal conviction. These records are maintained by the Office of International Programs. 4. The University considers the following to be directory information: student's name; hometown address; student's local address; telephone and place of birth; major field of study; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; dates of attendance; grade level; enrollment status; degrees and awards received; the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student; and the student's thesis title. 5. The University maintains a development database that is intended for the use of University employees and volunteers acting on behalf of the University. The database may include information on students as drawn from the registrar file and may include directory information. The information is not for sale to outside agencies and is released outside the internal campus community when necessary for University business. Research and gift information contained in the database is strictly confidential and will only be released outside the Office of Advancement when necessary for University business. 6. The University also maintains for each student a medical record showing history, treatment, etc. These records are maintained at the Student Health Center and, while specifically excluded from Public Law 90-247, are still available for inspection by the individual student on request. 7. The University also maintains for each student seen by the Office of Guidance and Career Development or the Section 504 Coordinator, records of those visits and other relevant records in those offices. Texas Wesleyan University 48 8. The University also maintains advising information on each student. Unofficial and informal advising materials may be maintained by individual faculty advisors. SPECIAL RECORDS 1. Student discipline records are maintained by the Dean of Students in that office and are available to the student life staff and disciplinary committee as needed. 2. These records are also available to senior administrative officers or their designees as appropriate. The University will keep a record, available to the student and kept with the personal file, of all persons and organizations, other than those authorized within the University, requesting or obtaining access to the files. This record will indicate specifically the legitimate interest that each person or organization obtaining access to the records has in such records. ACCESS DEFINED 1. Access to student records by University officials is a by-product of the need to know. Such access is delineated in item 1 of this policy; the need for an individual to know information in order to fulfill her/his responsibilities does not allow that individual to share the information with other staff or with individuals external to the campus without the permission of the student. 2. Neither student records nor those housed in the Office of Financial Aid nor any personally identifiable information, other than directory information (see #4 above), will be made available to anyone else, other than the student, without written consent. Where consent is required and given, the student upon request, will receive a copy of the records to be released. 3. No student can be required, nor will be asked, to waive rights under Part 99 of the Code of Federal Regulations. However, a student may voluntarily waive right of access to confidential statements made by third parties respecting admission to education agencies or institutions, applications for employment, or the receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. In case of waiver, the confidential statements will be used solely for the purposes for which they were specifically intended, and the student will, upon request, be notified of the names of all persons making such confidential statements. 4. Any student who desires to review her/his record may do so by making a written request to the appropriate office immediately responsible for the record. Students may inspect their academic transcripts during normal working hours. The process for specific record access and/or copying of the record is summarized here: To see other records, students must provide a written request to the Office of Student Records, the Director of Financial Aid, or the Dean of Students, as appropriate. A mutually convenient time will be arranged within 10 working days after receipt of the request for the student to examine the records in the file. At that time the student may examine all records in the file with the exception of those specifically exempted by Part 99 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The student may obtain copies of any of the records available; the cost will be $.50 for the first page copied and $.10 for each additional page. All reasonable requests for University Policies 49 explanations or interpretations of the records will be honored, and if inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate data are found in the records, they will be promptly corrected or deleted. The student also has the right to insert into the records a written explanation respecting the contents of such records. APPEALING THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD 1. If the student and the University Registrar, the Director of Financial Aid, the Dean of Students, or their deputies do not agree on items contained in the records, the student may submit a written request to the Provost and Senior Vice President for a hearing to challenge the content of the records. The Provost and Senior Vice President will schedule such a hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request and will notify the student reasonably in advance of the hearing of its date, time, and place. The hearing will be before a board composed of the Provost and Senior Vice President or her/his designee, the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services or her/his designee, and at least one disinterested member of the faculty who shall be appointed by the Provost and Senior Vice President. None of those hearing the challenge may have a direct interest in the outcome. Students will be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assisted or represented by individuals of their choice at their own expense, including an attorney. The decision of the board on the correctness of the record, as determined by the majority vote, will be in writing and will be final. This decision will be based solely upon the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of the evidence and the reasons for the decision. 2. If, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the information in the files is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, the University shall amend the records accordingly and so inform the student in writing. However, if, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, it shall inform the student of the right to place in the records a statement commenting on the information in the records and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the University. MAINTENANCE OF THE RECORD 1. The University reserves the right, after a three-year period, to destroy any and all records that it maintains on a student except to the extent that law requires their maintenance for a longer period of time. 2. The Office of Advancement will assist former students of the University in acquiring information related to their own individual record. No inquiries from outside organizations or agencies will be accepted. The Office of Advancement will also assist, where possible, former students in getting information about other students. This assistance will occur only after the student inquired about is notified. Texas Wesleyan University 50 Administrative Suspension If, in the judgment of the Provost and/or Dean of Students, a student's behavior is disruptive to the educational process and/or a potential danger to a student and/or faculty/staff member and/or other individual in an off- campus Wesleyan educational placement (e.g. internship, practicum, or other), an administrative suspension may result. University officials and/or employees will not release any information regarding the reasons for the administrative suspension other than verifying the status (Right to Privacy Act). An exception will be made if the student gives written permission to disclose information regarding the suspension. All disciplinary files and permission letters will be kept in the Office of the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students or her/his designee is the only person authorized to discuss the case with anyone outside of the University. Administrative suspensions may be made by the Dean of Students and/or the Provost. Change of Name or Address A student who changes name, residence, or mailing address is expected to notify the Office of Student Records of this change immediately. Any communication from the University that is mailed to the name and address of record is considered to have been properly delivered. Holds A \"hold\" is an action on a student record that prevents students from registering, receiving official transcripts, receiving transfer credit, and/or graduating from the University.

School Manuals/Handbooks Schools and/or departments may publish manuals or handbooks outlining specific program requirements to supplement the University catalog. Students are expected to follow these policies, as related to their chosen major. Manuals may be obtained from a student's major department or school. Student Handbook The Texas Wesleyan University Student Handbook is published biannually by the University and is distributed during registration for the fall and spring semesters. It contains policies, procedures, and regulations developed by students, faculty, and administrative personnel of the University. The purpose of the handbook is to set forth the standards of conduct Texas Wesleyan expects of its students, to inform the student body of individual and group rights and responsibilities, and to describe the due-process procedures to be followed when citizenship violations occur. The handbook contains extensive information that is intended to acquaint the student with various aspects of University life and to serve as a guide to University services and activities. University Policies 53 It is important that the student become acquainted with the contents of the Student Handbook since enrollment at Texas Wesleyan is considered by the University as an implicit declaration of the acceptance of the rules and regu- lations contained therein. Copies of the Student Handbook may be obtained from the Office of Student Life.

Further documentation may be required to confirm the disability claim or to assist the University in determining the appropriate academic adjustment. Following its review, the Director will reach a determination regarding the existence of the disability for purposes of providing an academic adjustment. Information concerning a student's disability will be treated in a confidential manner in accordance with University policy as well as applicable federal and state law. The student will be informed of the Director's determination within 15 calendar days. If the determination confirms the existence of a disability requiring an academic adjustment, the student may meet with the Director to explore possible adjustments. A letter describing the adjustment the University will provide the student will be issued to the student within 15 calendar days after the formal request and all documentation is received. The student will have the responsibility of delivering the letter to, and conferring with, her or his professor concerning the implementation of the adjustment. If the academic adjustment is not provided or followed as outlined, the student shall report the matter to the Director within 15 calendar days. Application Deadlines To allow adequate time to evaluate the data properly and notify the parties involved, the following cut-off dates for application shall apply: Fall: November 15 Spring: April 1 Texas Wesleyan University 54 If the Director does not confirm the disability or the need for an academic adjustment, the student may challenge the determination by following the procedures outlined below.

Such confidential information shall only be disclosed on a need-to-know basis to those in the University or their designees and legal representatives (including outside counsel) authorized to participate in the investigation, adjudication or resolution, or to those outside the University, as required by court order or otherwise required by law. The University cannot guarantee confidentiality. Texas Wesleyan University 58 PROCEEDINGS Once the complaint has been received, the appropriate authority, as defined by this policy, shall promptly initiate the specific complaint and investigation procedure applicable for the accused individual, according to the appropriate policy. The unified policy and procedures are cross-referenced to appropriate University policy manuals. COMPLAINT PROCEDURES IN GENERAL The University recognizes the need for each of the three segments of the University community (faculty, staff and students), with their unique missions and roles, to have their own respective complaint procedures. Although this is a unified policy for the University community, specific complaint procedures are listed for each segment, depending upon which member of the University community is being charged with harassment or discrimination. Complaints against vendors and guests should follow the complaint procedures for charges against staff employees. Complaints should be delivered in writing to the appropriate person as specified in this policy. However, verbal complaints may be accepted. Complaints must provide the name of the person alleged to have harassed or discriminated against the complainant, specific details of the alleged conduct or act, a list of witnesses (if any), a desired remedy, and any other pertinent details. WHO MAY USE THE PROCEDURE The complaint procedure described herein shall be available to any faculty member, staff member, student, vendor or guest who believes that he or she has been harassed or discriminated against by a faculty member, staff member, student, vendor or guest in the context of the accused individual's performance of University-related functions. LODGING OF COMPLAINT AGAINST A FACULTY MEMBER Investigation Any complaint of harassment or discrimination against a faculty member shall be reported immediately to the Provost. The Provost shall promptly assign the complaint to two (2) appropriate administrators of at least the senior staff level or someone who directly reports to the senior staff. These administrators shall investigate the complaint, interview the parties and others in possession of pertinent information, review relevant documentation and evidence, reach an initial determination of whether harassment or discrimination has occurred and, depending upon its severity, seek to resolve the matter informally. If the administrators believe that immediate harm to either party or the integrity of the investigation is threatened by the continued performance of the accused faculty member's customary duties or responsibilities, the administrators may recommend to the Provost that the accused faculty member be suspended with pay, or reassigned pending the completion of the investigation. The investigation shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the complaint by the Provost, unless notice of delay is given. Within this time frame, the administrators shall prepare a written report of the investigation, which shall include their initial determination. University Policies 59 Informal Resolution Upon completion of the investigation and depending upon its severity, the administrators are authorized to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the University, the complaining party and the accused faculty member. If a resolution satisfactory to the University and both parties is reached through the efforts of the administrators, a written statement, a copy of which shall be attached to the administrators' report, shall indicate the agreement reached by the parties and shall be signed and dated by each party and by the administrators. At that time, all action contemplated under the agreement shall be taken and the investigation shall be closed. Determination of Merits of Complaint In arriving at a determination of the existence of harassment or discrimination, the administrators shall consider the evidence as a whole, the totality of the circumstances, and the context in which the alleged events occurred. The determination of the existence of harassment or discrimination shall be made from the facts on a case-by-case basis. Determination of No Harassment or Discrimination If the administrators determine that no harassment or discrimination has occurred, they shall dismiss the complaint, giving prompt written notice of said dismissal to each party involved. The complaining party or the University has the right to appeal said dismissal in writing, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of the notice of dismissal, to the Provost. If no appeal is filed within the fifteen (15) calendar day period, the matter is automatically closed. If a determination of no harassment or discrimination is appealed, the Provost shall make a written recommendation to the President within seven (7) calendar days. The President shall notify all parties of his or her decision in writing within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the Provost's recommendation. The President's decision is final. Determination of Harassment or Discrimination If the administrators determine that harassment or discrimination has occurred and that a particular sanction is appropriate, they shall promptly notify the parties without providing details of the sanctions to the complainant. The accused faculty member, the complaining party or the University may appeal said determination, in writing, to the Provost within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of notice of determination. If no appeal is filed within the fifteen (15) calendar day period, the matter is automatically closed. If a determination of harassment or discrimination is appealed, the Provost shall make a written recommendation to the President within seven (7) calendar days. The President shall notify all parties of his or her decision in writing within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the Provost's recommendation. The President's decision is final. Revocation of Tenure and Termination as Possible Sanction for Harassment or Discrimination If the administrators determine at any stage in the investigation that the evidence of harassment or discrimination is sufficiently clear and severe, and the Provost concurs in writing, so as to warrant the immediate commencement of proceedings to revoke tenure and/or terminate the faculty member, the case shall be removed from the complaint procedures contained herein and resolved in accordance with the revocation of tenure and termination policies and procedures for faculty members. The faculty member shall be suspended, with pay, pending formal resolution of the matter. Texas Wesleyan University 60 LODGING OF COMPLAINT AGAINST A STAFF EMPLOYEE, GUEST, OR VENDOR Persons who have complaints alleging harassment or discrimination against a staff employee, guest or vendor are encouraged to raise them either orally or in writing to the Associate Vice President for Administration and Human Resources, a supervisor, the department head, Dean, Divisional Vice President or the Provost. It is recommended, although not required, that the complainant follows the \"chain of command.\" For example, staff employees are encouraged to lodge complaints within their respective work area. The person receiving the complaint shall communicate it promptly to the Associate Vice President for Administration and Human Resources or the Director of Human Resources. The Office of Human Resources shall be responsible for investigating complaints. In the event of a conflict of interest involving the Office of Human Resources, the complaint shall be assigned by the Associate Vice President for Administration and Human Resources to a Divisional Vice President for investigation. Nothing in this policy shall require a complainant to file a complaint with the individual who is accused of harassment or discrimination. Investigation Upon receipt of a complaint of harassment or discrimination against a staff employee, guest or vendor, the Office of Human Resources shall investigate the complaint itself or assign it to two (2) administrators, each of whom must be either a Vice President, Associate Vice President or someone who directly reports to a Vice President, Associate Vice President and who is employed at least at the director level. The Office of Human Resources or the assigned administrators shall investigate the complaint, interview the parties and witnesses involved and gather all pertinent information. The investigation shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the complaint, unless notice of delay is given. A written report shall be prepared, unless advised otherwise by University legal counsel. At any stage in the investigation, an accused employee may be suspended with pay or reassigned.

This policy may be amended, amplified or withdrawn by the University, in its sole discretion, at any time. Written Student Complaint Policy Texas Wesleyan University recognizes the value of information provided by students about the performance of the University in providing the services and meeting the goals which our mission describes. It is University policy to invite feedback, and, whenever possible, to use that feedback to continue to improve the services and functions of the University. Ideally, students will be able to resolve any problems by dealing directly with the individual (such as a faculty or staff member) or office (such as a student service or administrative office) involved. However, if a student is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution and wishes to pursue the matter further, or if a student wishes to register a formal complaint, a written complaint may be addressed to the Office of the Provost. Written complaints should contain the following information: \u00b7 The complainant's name and contact information; \u00b7 A clear description of the problem or complaint; \u00b7 Appropriate supporting documentation that is directly related to the complaint; \u00b7 A description of any subsequent actions taken by the complainant or the University; \u00b7 A description of the desired outcome. University Policies 63 All written complaints received and copies of any responses will be kept on file in the Office of the Provost. Complaints that are unsigned or are not received in written format (e.g., complaints received by phone or electronically) will not be considered. The Provost will respond to each complaint within 15 business days of receipt. If no other action was requested, the response will acknowledge receipt of the complaint. If further action is requested, the response will describe the actions to be initiated by Office of the Provost and any further information from the complainant that may be required. ACADEMIC MATTERS Written complaints about grades will not be addressed by the Office of the Provost unless the student has already discussed the grade with the course instructor, the department or division head (if any), and the appropriate Dean, respectively. Appropriate documentation would include copies of the student's coursework, the course syllabus, and any other materials related to specific assignments (such as handouts or correspondence with the instructor). NON-ACADEMIC MATTERS Written complaints about administrative or other student services should be directed initially to the appropriate office, but may be submitted to the Provost if satisfactory resolution is not achieved. Appropriate documentation would include copies of any relevant contracts, notices, or other official or informal correspondence with the office or other University personnel.

Roles of Academic Offices OFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT The Provost and Senior Vice President serves as the chief academic officer at the University. As such, the Provost acts on recommendations from the deans and directors regarding matters of academic policy, student petitions, and other matters affecting the academic lives of the students of the University. Questions concerning issues of academic policy should be directed to the Office of the Provost. Students seeking counsel on specific academic programs or seeking to address issues affecting their program should consult with the program director of their graduate program and the dean of the school in which she/he is enrolled. All petitions for course substitutions, readmission to the University, or other exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Office of the Provost for final determination. ACADEMIC DEANS Texas Wesleyan University is organized into five academic schools: Arts and Letters, Business and Professional Programs, Education, Law, and Natural and Social Sciences. Each school is headed by the dean of the school who has primary responsibility for implementing academic policies affecting those schools. Students with questions about programs that are not addressed in this catalog should consult with their program director and/or with the dean of the school. Students seeking alternatives to the stated requirements should consult with the dean of the school or her/his designee. All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the graduate program director of the student's program and the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Concerns regarding the faculty or staff assigned to the respective schools should be addressed to the dean of the school. Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 65 GRADUATE PROGRAM DIRECTORS Each graduate program is headed by a graduate program director who has primary responsibility for program implementation for the school. The director coordinates program offerings in conjunction with the dean, admits students in cooperation with the Admission Office, plans the new student orientation, and serves as initial advisor to the student. Students with questions concerning academic policy should initially consult with the program director and then the dean of the school. UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE PROGRAMS The University Committee on Graduate Programs provides a forum for graduate program issues and academic affairs. The Committee reviews nominations for graduate faculty and the process for the hiring of contributing graduate faculty. It also assesses and evaluates all graduate programs. Membership includes the director of each graduate program, two faculty members from each graduate program, one dean from the four schools (term limit one year, non-voting), Provost (ex-officio), Director of West Library (ex-officio), and Coordinator of Graduate Admissions (ex-officio). GRADUATE FACULTY Appointed Graduate Faculty To be appointed to the graduate faculty, an individual must be nominated according to the graduate faculty appointment policy by his/her dean to the Committee on Graduate Programs. Nominations are then sent to the Provost who in turn makes the appointment. Candidates must have an earned terminal degree (or ABD with satisfactory progress) in the discipline or disciplines of the graduate courses being taught or must otherwise meet accreditation guidelines. It is expected that the candidate meet the \"18 hours in a field\" guideline and/or have clinical and/or unique qualifications. They must also demonstrate successful teaching in the discipline, demonstrate intellectual activity at the graduate level, or show progress towards intellectual activity at the graduate level, and they must hold the University rank of Assistant Professor, or higher, or the title of administrative faculty in the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia. Contributing Graduate Faculty Full-time, adjunct, and/or part-time faculty, called contributing graduate faculty, may be invited or assigned to teach graduate courses on a semester by semester basis. The invitation or assignment is made by the dean of the school and a school-based faculty committee, and the process is reviewed by the Committee on Graduate programs. OFFICE OF STUDENT RECORDS The purpose of the Office of Student Records is to provide secure, efficient storage of permanent student records and to maintain the integrity of the University Undergraduate and Graduate catalogs. Students rely on the office for a variety of services including registration, schedule changes, verification of enrollment, maintenance of current address information, graduation audit, grades, official transcripts, and degree plans. Texas Wesleyan University 66 Academic Policies ACADEMIC STANDARDS Academic standards are designed to provide close supervision of the program of study and academic progress of a student. Students should refer to the catalog section of their program of study for expected standards. CATALOG A student will normally complete requirements for a degree within the maximum 10 calendar years from the date of initial enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University. A student who has not been in continuous enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University and who re-enrolls after the 10-year maximum time period has elapsed will complete requirements for a degree under the catalog that is current on the date of re-enrollment. A student who re-enrolls within the 10-year period should continue with their original catalog. Exceptions must be approved by the dean of the school. Students may elect to move to a more recent catalog to complete their degree. However, this election to change catalog years will be allowed only once. All degree requirements in the most recent catalog must be completed. A Catalog Year Change Request Form must be completed and retained in the student's academic file. COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY Basic to success in any academic program is skill in written and oral communication. The student must exhibit a capability in communication as a requirement of any course. Any instructor in any course may require a student who lacks skill in communication to seek assistance. COURSES Auditing Any course may be audited with approval of the instructor. On the first day of class, permission should be obtained from the instructor and the completed audit form submitted to the Office of Student Records. The student will be registered as an audit student and pays an audit fee. The term \"AU\" will appear on the student's transcript. A grade will not be awarded. A student may not change from audit to credit nor credit status to audit after the conclusion of the drop/add period. Change of Schedule (Add/Drop) After registration has been completed, a student may change her/his schedule only during the drop/add period. Courses may be dropped or added only with the permission of the instructor and graduate program director using the \"Change of Course\" form. No course may be added after the first week of classes. Class Attendance Regular and punctual attendance at all scheduled classes is expected of all students. University regulations authorize certain absences of students when representing the University (e.g. participation in Intercollegiate athletic competitions, and student government, student development, or fine arts events). Absences that may be necessary to fulfill course requirements and are approved by the Provost are also considered to be authorized. The maximum number of authorized absences during one semester is five for Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 67 a Monday-Wednesday- Friday class, three for a Tuesday-Thursday class, and two for a class or laboratory meeting once a week. Additional authorized absences may be granted on an individual basis when extreme circumstances warrant (e.g. advancement to and representation of the university at regional or national level intercollegiate athletic, academic, or fine arts competition). Individual faculty may not enforce a more restrictive policy than what is set by the University. Students are required to notify instructors prior to any missed class and will be held responsible for all class and laboratory assignments. Unauthorized absences may be excused when caused by illness or other emergencies and should be reported promptly to the instructor. When a student has a number of unauthorized absences equal to the number of days the class meets per week, the student may be dropped from the class roll by the instructor of the class. (See \"Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal from a Course\" in the Graduate Catalog.) Class attendance is critical to a student's success in the C. E. Hyde Weekend/Evening Program, since many classes meet every other weekend. A student who is absent from class must contact the instructor before the absence if possible. Class absences jeopardize a student's academic success and grade. Each instructor determines specific attendance policies. Class Load The normal graduate class load is 9 hours and is the minimum class load for classification as a full-time student during the fall, spring, or extended summer semester. Summer sessions may be offered in two shorter sessions, in this instance 6 hours per term is the maximum class load for which a student may register. During the fall, spring or extended summer terms, 12 hours is the maximum for which a student may register. Any exception to this must be made with the written permission of the dean of the student's school. The number of hours in which a student enrolls should be carefully considered in consultation with her/his advisor. As a general rule, a full-time class load of 9 hours is a commitment to a 40-hour week of attendance and out-of-class preparation/assignments. Concurrent Enrollment Texas Wesleyan University students desiring concurrent enrollment must have the written approval of the dean of their school before enrolling at another institution. When a student requests concurrent enrollment, consideration must be given to the residence requirement. Conference Course A conference course is a course taught by an instructor to an individual student. A student may enroll for a conference course only by approval of the instructor of the course, the dean of the school in which the conference course is offered, and the University Registrar. Approval is normally given only when the following requirements are met: (1) a conference course may be taken only in the last regular semester or summer term before the graduation of the student; (2) the course requested must be required for graduation; (3) the course is not scheduled to be taught that semester or term; (4) there is a conflict in schedule between two required courses during the last semester or term before graduation; and (5) the student must be enrolled in one or more regular courses in the University. An additional fee is charged for conference courses. Texas Wesleyan University 68 Course Credit Academic credit assigned to a subject is expressed in semester hours. The credit-hour value of each course is indicated by the second digit in the course number. The number of hours a class meets each week is the same as the credit-hour value of the course, with some exceptions, such as laboratory- type courses. Course Descriptions Students should refer to the catalog section pertaining to their program of study. Course Numbering Courses numbered 5000 and above are graduate-level courses. The first digit of the course number indicates course level, the second digit indicates credit hour, and the third and fourth digits give the course sequence. If the content of a course and/or its title changes, a new course number may be assigned and students may enroll in the new course to complete a degree requirement requiring the former. The former course number will appear in parentheses, ( ), after the new title in the course listing. Course Substitution or Waiver When a student seeks approval for a change in the degree plan from the requirements stated in the catalog, a substitution or waiver form must be completed. The student, the student's advisor, and the dean must sign this form before it is forwarded to the Office of Student Records to be included in the student's permanent file. A course substitution form is required for all transfer credit. Independent Study An independent study course covers subject matter that is not offered in the university catalog but is of special interest to the student. These courses of independent study or supervised research may be offered for 1 to 4 hours credit. The third and fourth digits in the number listing for these courses will be 50. Approval of the proposed study by the dean of the school, the chairperson of the department, and the instructor who will supervise the study is required prior to registration. A syllabus must be acknowledged by both the instructor and student and a copy kept on file in the dean's office. A maximum of 9 hours of directed study and supervised research will be accepted for graduation requirement. Joint Undergraduate/Graduate Enrollment Undergraduate students with senior standing may register for up to six hours of graduate credit (see 5000 or above series courses in the Graduate Catalog) with the consent of the dean of their school and the dean of the school in whose program the courses reside/Director of GPNA and the course instructor. Graduate courses applied towards an undergraduate degree may not be applied towards a graduate degree. Certain courses are cross\u0001listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross\u0001listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 69 Repeating Courses Any course taken at Texas Wesleyan University and repeated for a grade must be repeated at Texas Wesleyan University. Any course taken at another institution may be repeated at Texas Wesleyan, and the most recent grade on the course will be counted. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be computed using the most recent grade achieved. The student is advised to notify the Office of Student Records when a course is repeated so that proper grade points can be recorded. Individual program requirements may restrict the repetition of some courses. Special Topics Special topics may be offered at a level of 5000 or higher in any department; credit hours may range from 1 to 4 hours. The third and fourth digits in the number listing for these courses will be 99. Approval of the proposed special topics course by the dean of the school is required prior to scheduling the course. This course may be repeated with change of topic. Undergraduate/Graduate Cross-listed Courses Certain courses are cross-listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross-listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. In cross-listed courses, graduate students must complete additional course requirements in order to receive graduate credit. GRADING A grade is assigned for each course in which a student is regularly enrolled. A passing grade may be earned only if the student is enrolled for the duration of the course. The following grades are used by Texas Wesleyan University: Grade Description Grade Points A Excellent 4.0 B Above average 3.0 C Average 2.0 D Below average 1.0 F Failing 0.0 P Passing * *Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA) The following may appear on the transcript in lieu of a grade but are not included in the GPA calculation: AU Audit * CR Credit * I Incomplete * W Withdrawal * T Temporary * *Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA) The grade \"I\" (incomplete) is given only when the student's work is satisfactory but, for reasons beyond the control of the student, has not been completed. It is not given in lieu of an \"F\" (failing). It is the responsibility of the student to confer with the instructor of the course and to complete the Texas Wesleyan University 70 prescribed requirements of the course by the designated date shown in the University Academic Calendar. For each \"I\" assigned, the instructor will file an Incomplete Grade Form with the Office of Student Records. On or before the designated date, the instructor will assign a grade and report it to the Office of Student Records. If a new grade is not reported by the designated date, the \"I\" will automatically convert to an \"F.\" Once an \"F\" is given, it cannot be changed without repeating the course in which it was given. No grade changes may be made after one (1) year from the time the grade was originally issued. This limit also applies to grades issued following completion of an \"incomplete\" (I) grade. The grade \"T\" is a temporary grade assigned if a course extends beyond the regular semester dates. This grade is not used in lieu of an \"I\" but is given to students who are enrolled in courses in which grades will not be available until after the regular semester ends. Examples of such courses are Weekend University summer courses and certain courses taken abroad. In some programs, selected courses may be graded on a \"P\" (pass) or \"F\" (fail) basis at the option of the Graduate Advisory Committee. A factor in determining a student's grade in any course will be competency in the use of written and spoken English. Grade Point Average. Grade points are used in computing the grade point averages (GPA) required for admission, graduation, and other scholastic requirements. Grade point averages are computed based on A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0. Grade point averages are computed at the end of each semester and at the end of each summer term. The GPA for a particular period is determined by dividing the total number of grade points received by the total number of hours for which the student was enrolled and in which a grade other than \"W,\" \"I,\" \"P,\" or \"T\" was received. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be computed, within the limitations of the student's specific program, using the most recent grade achieved. The student is advised to notify the Office of Student Records when a course is repeated so that proper grade points can be recorded. For courses taken at another institution and repeated at the other institution prior to enrolling at Texas Wesleyan University, the last grade awarded for the course will be shown on the Wesleyan transcript. Grade Appeal Process 1. Students wishing to appeal a grade must do so in a timely fashion. For grades assigned during a semester and which are incorporated into the final grade, the appeal must be initiated before the completion of the semester. For course grades or grades on assignments completed within the last week of the semester, the appeal must be initiated before the end of the following semester. For appeals of grades assigned in the fall semester, a student has until the end of the following spring semester; for grades assigned in the spring, the student has until the end of the following fall semester; for grades assigned during the summer, the student has until the end of the following fall semester. 2. If a student decides to appeal a grade, the student makes an appointment with the instructor for the purpose of discussing the grade assignment. This meeting establishes an appeal. If an instructor is not available because of part-time, sabbatical, or other circumstances, the student may begin with step (3). Under extremely unusual circumstances, grades may be appealed beyond these deadlines. Students should realize that Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 71 pertinent documentation (e.g. other students' papers) becomes less readily available as time passes. 3. If the results of the meeting with the instructor are unsatisfactory, the student makes an appointment with the department chair*. 4. The student will bring to the meeting with the department chair a written complaint (a) stating what grade is being appealed and, (b) on what basis it is being appealed. The student should also bring all pertinent materials such as the assignment for which the grade is being appealed, the syllabus for the course, previous grades assigned in the course, etc. 5. The department chair will review the materials and the appeal with the student with the thought of ascertaining the issues involved in the appeal. Additional information may be requested from the student and/or the instructor. The department chair will attempt to resolve the appeal informally between the student and the instructor. 6. If the appeal cannot be resolved informally, the department chair will meet with the dean to discuss the issues involved and to transmit the documentation developed to that point. The dean will then schedule an appointment with the student and the instructor to discuss the appeal. The dean will have the responsibility to determine the merits of the appeal. The dean may request assignments submitted by other students, a review or re-grading of the assignment, and a review of the grade(s) by qualified individuals or other faculty, and/or request other materials as necessary to support a decision. The decision to obtain more information or to refer the case to others is that of the dean. 7. The dean will make a written recommendation to the Provost to approve or deny the grade appeal. 8. If the grade appeal is denied, the student may appeal to the Provost as the chief academic officer. The Provost has the responsibility to review the procedures followed in the review process in order to determine if due process was followed. If the grade appeal is approved, the instructor may appeal to the Committee on Faculty Grievances. *If there is no department chair, the appointment is made with the dean and steps (4) and (5) are carried out by the dean. If the grade appeal concerns the department chair, the appointment is made directly with the dean. If the grade appeal concerns the dean, the appointment is made with the Provost. If the grade appeal concerns the Provost, the appointment is made with the President. PETITIONS All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. All petitions for exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Office of Student Records. GRADUATION APPLICATION DEADLINES An application for graduation must be filed in the Office of Student Records during the term prior to completing graduation requirements. November 1 is the application deadline for Spring graduates, and late applications will not be accepted after February 28 of the Spring semester in which graduation occurs. Texas Wesleyan University 72 April 1 is the application deadline for Fall graduates, and late applications will not be accepted after September 30 of the Fall semester in which graduation occurs.

When a student has a number of unauthorized absences equal to the number of hours the class meets per week (in a fall or spring semester), the student may be dropped from the class roll by the instructor of the class. A student dropped by the instructor for excessive unauthorized absences will have a grade of \"DP\" (dropped) recorded on her/his transcript. A grade of \"F\" (failure) will be assigned if the withdrawal is after the date for receiving a grade of \"DP\" as specified in the University catalog. A student may be reinstated in the class with the consent of the instructor and the dean of the school in which the course is offered. A student who has been absent from any regular examination and has satisfied the instructor that the absence was due to serious illness or other unavoidable cause may take a special examination at the discretion of the instructor concerned. Student Initiated Withdrawal from a Course. A student may drop from a course during the period specified in the University catalog and will have a grade of \"DP\" (dropped) recorded on her/his transcript.

Graduate Programs in Business 75 GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN BUSINESS Hector Quintanilla, Dean Sameer Vaidya, Associate Dean Mission The School of Business Administration and Professional Programs (SOBAPP) is a community of learners dedicated to pursuing and sharing the values, knowledge and skills that enable our students to compete in a dynamic and increasingly global environment. The School of Business Administration and Professional Programs is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) and a non-accredited member of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Degrees and Programs Offered B.B.A./M.B.A. Bachelor of Business Administration/ Master of Business Administration M.B.A. Master of Business Administration BACHELOR OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION/ MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (B.B.A./M.B.A.) The joint B.B.A./M.B.A. program provides students an undergraduate degree with a concentration in accounting and a M.B.A. degree. By meeting requirements for the two degrees simultaneously, students are able to earn the B.B.A. and M.B.A. degrees in a shorter length of time than if each of the degrees were pursued separately. The joint B.B.A./M.B.A. degree program gives students planning to take the CPA exam the capability to complete the 150 semester hours of study required by the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy to become licensed as a Certified Public Accountant. This degree may be completed in approximately five years. Applicants are initially admitted into the Bachelor of Business Administration with an Accounting Concentration program and follow that program's requirements. Students may apply for admission into the M.B.A. program upon completion of 90 undergraduate credit hours of their junior year and are admitted to the M.B.A. program in their senior year. When a student has earned 115 credit hours and has been admitted into the M.B.A. program, they may choose to remain in their original undergraduate catalog year for graduate school or change to the current graduate catalog year. MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (M.B.A.) The M.B.A. program at Texas Wesleyan University provides students with an overall business management education through both classroom study and opportunities to apply a core set of management skills in a hands-on field setting. The M.B.A. program consists of three levels of study: (1) foundation courses; (2) core courses; and (3) functional, or elective, courses. Foundation courses provide students without business degrees a basic level of business knowledge that will contribute to a student's successful completion of Texas Wesleyan University 76 graduate-level business courses. Foundation course work consists of classes related to business statistics, marketing and management principles, accounting principles, and economics and finance principles. Students without basic computer skills will be required to complete a fundamental computing course. These hours do not apply toward the M.B.A. degree and are in addition to the 36-hour requirement for the graduate degree. Fundamental course work is determined based on a review of students' transcripts. Graduate-level core courses are required of all graduate students. Core courses are required and provide students with a well-rounded base of business courses giving graduates the business management skills needed to be competitive in today's business job market. The functional (elective) courses are primarily designed to provide students with applied business education in \"real-life\" business situations. Graduate Faculty Individuals appointed to the graduate faculty hold the highest degree in their field except in those cases where a person possesses special knowledge or has had unique business experience. The graduate faculty is appointed by the Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Program as outlined in the graduate faculty appointments and assignments policy in the faculty handbook. Graduate Committee in Business The Graduate Committee recommends policy, hears appeals, and approves and recommends curricular changes for the graduate business programs. Membership includes: \u00b7 Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs; \u00b7 Associate Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs (Chairperson); \u00b7 All appointed and contributing graduate faculty in the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs. Graduate Student Orientation Each semester the Dean of the School of Business Administration and staff host an orientation session for the purpose of acquainting new graduate students with the campus, faculty, and administration.

ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Applicants to the joint degree B.B.A./M.B.A. program must meet the admission requirements of both the undergraduate and the graduate programs and follow the application procedures for the respective programs. Please see the Undergraduate Catalog for undergraduate admission requirements. M.B.A. admission decisions are based on an overall evaluation of the items listed below to estimate an applicant's potential for success in the graduate program. Admission requirements for the graduate programs are as follows: Degree-seeking students \u00b7 A baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university; \u00b7 For the M.B.A. or the 5-year dual accounting degree, an applicant must have an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution with an overall GPA of 2.6 or higher and a minimum of 1000 points based on a GPA for the last 60 hours and a Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score. To calculate the minimum points, use the formula: GPA (last 60 hours) x 200 + GMAT score (or GRE to GMAT conversion score) \u0001 1000*; \u00b7 Three letters of recommendation showing that the applicant is motivated to achieve; has the capacity to contribute to the learning process; and will bring real life experience to the program that will enhance the overall experience of other graduate students*; Texas Wesleyan University 78 \u00b7 Two essays to document the student's objectives in pursuing a graduate business degree; \u00b7 A copy of student's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to assess professional and academic preparation for graduate studies; \u00b7 An interview with the Dean of the School of Business Administration to ensure the student's goals are consistent with the program. *B.B.A./M.B.A. in Accounting students must submit letters of recommendation from at least two full-time accounting faculty members indicating academic capability and commitment to the program and an accounting career. Minimum points and scores are subject to change upon revision to graduate admissions tests. Provisional Admission Students applying for admission to the M.B.A. or 5-year dual accounting degree program who do not meet the minimum point requirement but show promise through their work experience, interview, and recommendation letters may be considered by the Dean of the School of Business Administration for provisional admittance to the program. After 12 hours, the student will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee to determine their status in the M.B.A. program. Conditional Admission Students who wish to start the program prior to taking the GMAT exam may be conditionally admitted for one term only and for no more than 6 semester hours. Students conditionally admitted must provide satisfactory test scores to the Graduate Business Programs Office within two months of the semester start date in which they were admitted (fall, spring, or summer). Students who submit GMAT scores that, combined with GPA, do not meet minimum admission requirements have the remainder of that semester to repeat the exam and present minimally acceptable scores; else, they may be classified as non-degree seeking and will be required to complete 12 hours of foundation coursework with grades of \"B\" or better in each class before their program status may be reconsidered. Non-Degree Seeking Students A non-degree-seeking student is defined as a student holding an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution with an overall GPA of 2.5. The student may enroll for only selected graduate or undergraduate courses at Texas Wesleyan University and is not eligible for financial aid. However, students may still be eligible for an alumni discount as prescribed by the current graduate catalog. A graduate faculty advisor will assist the student in selecting appropriate courses. Up to 12 hours of course work completed under non-degree-seeking status may be applied toward a graduate degree at Texas Wesleyan University. A student who wishes to be admitted to the graduate program as a degree-seeking student must reapply through the Office of the Dean of the School of Business Administration. OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS Transcripts from all institutions of higher learning attended must be submitted, regardless of whether a degree was earned. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the issuing institution to the Graduate Business Programs. The designation \"student copy,\" \"issued notations are not acceptable. This includes hand-delivered transcripts or copies received from a third party, Graduate Programs in Business 79 except in rare and documented instances in which international applicants are unable to provide official transcripts. If you attended a non-U.S. institution, please send transcripts in both the original language and an official translation of the transcript. A copy of your diploma (graduation certificate) is also required. Assistance with Your Application: If you have any questions about applying to the program or would like assistance in completing your application, please contact the Office of Graduate Admissions. Academic Policies TRANSFER CREDIT There is no automatic transfer of credit from another university. The Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs and the Graduate Committee must review and recommend approval of transfer of credit. To be eligible for transfer, the course(s) must be a part of the student's chosen program and must have been completed within the seven-year time limitation in which the master's degree is to be completed. To be eligible for transfer, a course grade of \"B\" or above is required. A maximum of 6 hours of graduate credit may be transferred from an accredited institution. Acceptance of transfer credit toward business graduate degree program requirements is contingent upon its relevance and appropriateness to the degree being sought and is subject to approval by the Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs and the Graduate Committee. Transfer hours will receive a grade of \"P\" and will therefore not be computed in the GPA. Courses credited toward a previous degree may not be credited toward the Master of Business Administration. Students enrolled in \"for credit\" special courses, college-sponsored seminars and institutes are expected to obtain grades of \"B\" or above. To apply these credits (maximum 6 hours) toward a degree, the student must obtain approval from the Graduate Committee and subject to final approval by the Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs. TIME LIMITATION A student must complete the requirements for a graduate degree in the School of Business within seven years from the date of initial enrollment in graduate courses at Texas Wesleyan University. Students may, in writing, request an additional extension of time to graduate which must be approved by the Graduate Committee. All decisions made by the Graduate Committee will be communicated to the student in writing and approved extension requests may have stipulations or conditions included which must be adhered to by the student. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT To be awarded the Master of Business Administration or Master in Management, students must successfully complete a minimum of 30 credit hours at Texas Wesleyan University. Texas Wesleyan University 80 GRADING Graduate credit is allowed only for courses completed with grades \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C,\" although grades \"D\" and \"F\" are used in computing grade point averages. No final grade assigned for a graduate-level course may be raised unless an error has been made. The substitution of another course for one completed with a lower grade is not permitted. Selected courses may be graded on a \"P\" (pass) or \"F\" (fail) basis at the option of the Graduate Advisory Committee. No more than 3 hours may be graded pass/fail. A grade of \"P\" for a pass/fail course is not calculated in the grade point average. However, a grade of \"F\" for a pass/fail course will be used in the grade point calculation. MINIMUM ACADEMIC STANDARDS The graduate business programs in the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs requires that a student maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (\"B\") or better. The Graduate Committee of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs will recommend withdrawal of a student from a master's program if a student receives two course grades below \"C.\" This rule applies to all course work, including any foundation or foundation equivalent the student undertakes after being admitted to the M.B.A. program. For purposes of enforcing this withdrawal rule, the first grade received in a course is used by the Graduate Committee. Master's program students may not graduate with more than two \"Cs\" in their program requirements, although a course may be repeated once to raise a grade of \"C\" or lower. A student may not repeat more than three courses at the graduate level, and all replacement course work must be completed at Texas Wesleyan University. Pending recommendation of the Graduate Committee, the Dean of the School of Business Administration and Professional Programs will make the final decision on a student's withdrawal. When a graduate student's academic performance falls below a cumulative GPA of 3.0 on all graduate work attempted, she/he will be placed on academic probation. Probationary students must obtain an advising clearance form from their advisor. Students who register for courses other than those permitted by advisement will be administratively withdrawn from the courses. Students will remain on probation and be allowed to re-enroll for a subsequent semester as long as they achieve a minimum 3.0 GPA on all graduate work attempted during the semester, even if their overall graduate GPA remains under 3.0. The probation status is removed when the student's cumulative GPA on all graduate work attempted has been raised to 3.0 or better. Should students on probation fail to earn a 3.0 GPA in graduate work attempted during a semester (fall, spring, or summer), they will be withdrawn from the program. BACHELOR OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION/ MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION IN ACCOUNTING The student earning the joint B.B.A./M.B.A. degree with a specialty in accounting must meet the following requirements: Graduate Programs in Business 81 \u00b7 Completion of at least 36 semester hours of graduate work beyond the undergraduate credit hours required for the joint degree; \u00b7 A cumulative GPA of at least a 3.0 on all graduate work taken at Texas Wesleyan; \u00b7 A cumulative GPA of at least a 3.0 on all accounting courses, both graduate and undergraduate, taken at Texas Wesleyan after admission to the M.B.A. program; \u00b7 Cumulative GPA of at least a 3.0 on all courses taken for graduate credit; \u00b7 Cumulative GPA of at least a 2.5 on all non-accounting undergraduate courses taken at Texas Wesleyan University after admission to the M.B.A. program; \u00b7 At least 9 hours in 5000-level (or above) accounting courses at Texas Wesleyan; and \u00b7 Minimum academic standards for School of Business Administration and Professional Programs graduate students.

No application will be processed without valid nursing licensure. Applications that are incomplete at the application deadline date will not be considered. INTERVIEWS Interviews are conducted either on campus in Fort Worth or at select primary clinical training sites. Some of the primary clinical sites wish to participate in the interviews of the students who will train at their facility. Therefore, the applicant may need to participate in more than one interview during the selection process. Clinical sites that wish to interview their own applicants are identified on the program application form. SELECTION CRITERIA Total enrollment in the nurse anesthesia programs is limited. Therefore, all applicants who meet minimum requirements for admission may not be selected for an interview or to the program for the particular year in which the applicant wishes to enter. The admission of each class will be based upon the \"best qualified\" as determined by the Admissions Committee. Selection will be based upon the following criteria: \u00b7 Personal interview* in which the applicant demonstrates critical care knowledge, skills, and abilities; \u00b7 Work experience; \u00b7 Grade point average; \u00b7 GRE score; \u00b7 References that rate professional performance as excellent or above average; \u00b7 Medical questionnaire/certification form demonstrating applicant's good mental and physical health; \u00b7 Completed application form; \u00b7 ACLS and PALS; \u00b7 CCRN certification (if not previously submitted). * All positions are filled on a competitive basis. Therefore, all applicants that meet minimum admission requirements may not be granted an interview. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 155 Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant as determined by the Admissions Committee. All decisions by this committee are final and not subject to appeal. Outstanding candidates may qualify for early acceptance. The Graduate Program does not work on a \"waiting list\" system. If you are not selected for the year that you originally applied, you must submit the following to reapply for the next year: 1. Letter of intent and summary of your experiences; 2. Reference from a supervisor (on our reference form); 3. Official transcripts from colleges/universities that you may have attended since applying to our program; 4. CCRN certification (if applicable). You do not have to complete a new application or submit an additional application fee. It is unusual for applicants to be granted a third interview. BACKGROUND CHECKS After acceptance into the M.S.N.A. program, all students will be given instructions on how to complete a required background check. The background check must be completed using the system put in place by the program between the date of the acceptance letter and July 1st of the year the student is scheduled to start the program. All students may be required to complete and pass a background check at the completion of Phase I to meet the requirements of clinical training facilities. The cost of the background checks is the students' responsibility. Students who do not pass a background check may be denied entry into the program or entry into Phase II of the program which will result in dismissal from the program. TRANSFER CREDITS Candidates for the Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia (M.S.N.A.) must complete all Texas Wesleyan University Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia courses. No courses may be transferred into the University. Candidates for the Master of Health Science may transfer 15 credit hours with approval of the Director, Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia. Rights of Applicants 1. The applicant has the right to expect honesty from the program and the program's publications. 2. The applicant has the right to expect fair and equal evaluation and consideration when applying for a position in the program. Environmental Exposure The evidence that trace anesthetic gases are harmful is at present suggestive rather than conclusive. A cause and effect relationship between occupational exposure and the adverse reproductive outcomes, such as spontaneous abortions, has not been firmly established.

Immunization Division, 800/252-9152. NON-DISCRIMINATION Texas Wesleyan University and Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia will not discriminate against any employee, applicant for employment, student, or registrant in the course of study because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or disability. Students will be assessed on an individual basis in relation to their ability to meet the didactic and clinical requirements of the curriculum. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Texas Wesleyan University and the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding its students with disabilities. It is the policy of Texas Wesleyan University that no student shall be denied access to or participation in the services, programs, and activities of the University solely on the basis of his or her disability. However, all students must be able to perform all of the didactic and clinical requirements of the curriculum as well as the physical competency standards with or without reasonable accommodations. Didactic and clinical professional and physical competency standards include: 1. Ability to observe and communicate. Nurse anesthetists must be able to observe, hear, and understand evidence about a patient's status quickly and accurately as well as communicate rapidly and clearly with patients, members of the healthcare team, and others. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 157 2. Physical capabilities and motor skills. Nurse anesthetists are required to move, transfer, and position patients and to locate and arrange equipment as needed; to be sufficiently mobile to provide care to several patients at a time, and to have sufficient dexterity, hand/eye coordination, and stamina to operate complicated instruments and perform proceedings for prolonged periods as necessary. 3. Cognitive skills and intellectual capacities. Nurse anesthetists are able to understand complex medical information related to patient needs and care; to transcribe and communicate that information quickly and accurately; and to distinguish standard from nonstandard patterns of patient behaviors and responses. 4. Decision making skills. Nurse anesthetists are expected to demonstrate the capacity to gather, organize, assess, prioritize, make decisions, and then act on information appropriately so as to facilitate the prompt and timely delivery of patient care. 5. Behavioral and social attributes. Nurse anesthetists should exhibit professionally appropriate behaviors at all times with patients, members of the healthcare delivery team, and the public. These behaviors include capacities to establish rapport and trust including respect for team roles and norms; to preserve confidentiality; to communicate clearly with patients, other health care providers and the public; to complete work in a timely manner; and to demonstrate commitment to ensuring the quality of and upgrade the practice of nurse anesthesia. 6. Ability to complete above competencies in the work environment. The operating room environment (including all anesthetizing areas) is loud and often chaotic. A nurse anesthesia provider, both CRNA and student, must be able to block out the confusion and maintain his or her patients' safety. This requires the nurse anesthesia provider to remain focused on the tasks at hand, evaluate and act in a timely fashion and communicate effectively with the other operating room personnel. At times of extreme stress, when the patient requires the full attention of the nurse anesthesia provider, additional time and a quiet environment cannot be given. DISABILITY SERVICES Students who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity can apply for accommodation according to the policies and procedures for students with disabilities. See \"University Policies\" in this catalog or contact the Director of Counseling for specific information. Academic or physical adjustments will be implemented in accordance with University Policies. Academic Accommodation Students who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity can apply for academic adjustments according to the policies and procedures for students with disabilities. See \"Students with Disabilities and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Policy and Procedures\" in the Graduate Catalog or contact the Director of Counseling for specific information. Academic adjustments will be implemented in accordance with these University policies. However, please note that for students enrolled in the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia, the University will not provide an academic adjustment or accommodation that would alter or waive the essential didactic and clinical professional requirements and/or physical competency standards stated above during any phase of the required training.

The RRNA is provided with operating room attire during clinical instruction. Most students will be required to rotate to enrichment health care facilities to meet all clinical requirements for graduation. Rotations may be local to or distant from the student's primary site. If a student rotates to a distant site, all costs including transportation, licensure, and housing may be the student's responsibility. Rotations to enrichment sites may be up to four months in length (total time) during Phase II and the student is encouraged to budget accordingly. Computer Requirements All students must maintain a working laptop computer and will be required to bring their computer to all classes. Computer maintenance is the responsibility of the student and computer malfunction will not constitute an excused absence from classroom participation or examinations. Course syllabi, notes and examinations will be provided/conducted on-line. Accessing and printing class material is the Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 159 students' responsibility. Lecture back-up streaming video is available only with high-speed Internet access. The computer should be less than three years old, wireless enabled, use Windows XP or newer operating system and run newer versions of Microsoft Office. In class monitors 13 inches or greater require a privacy screen. Radio controlled remote accessories are not permitted, but Bluetooth accessories are acceptable. All Texas Wesleyan Nurse Anesthesia classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled. All material is posted in Windows compatible format. MAC computers are permitted; however, users are responsible for their own compatibility issues. Academic Policies RRNA The term RRNA (Resident Registered Nurse Anesthetist) refers to a student enrolled in the Texas Wesleyan University's Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia program. RRNA appears to be a more acceptable term than \"student\" when in a patient care setting. Due to individual hospital or anesthesia group policies, a student may need to be identified as a SRNA (Student Registered Nurse Anesthetist) while performing clinical training at these facilities. ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP Associate membership is required in the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). Attendance at locally held meetings may also be required. Each student is required to attend a minimum of one local, state, or national meeting sponsored by the AANA or a state association. RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES The student has the right to: \u00b7 expect quality, appropriate education; \u00b7 be represented in the educational process; \u00b7 be regarded as a professional member of the health care community; \u00b7 receive fair and objective evaluations; and \u00b7 exercise due process of appeal. In addition, the RRNA has the responsibility to: \u00b7 demonstrate a professional manner at all times; and \u00b7 adhere to regulations and policies as set forth in the policy manuals and Student Handbook of Texas Wesleyan University and affiliating clinical settings. PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVES Professionalism includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following. The RRNA demonstrates: 1. Courtesy; 2. Honesty; 3. Punctuality; 4. Enthusiasm; 5. Appropriate language/communication skills; Texas Wesleyan University 160 6. Positive attitude; 7. Personal cleanliness/grooming; 8. Analytical/evaluation skills; 9. Willingness to follow instructions; 10. Willingness to learn/work hard; 11. Proper wearing of operating room attire; 12. Vigilance/awareness; 13. Organization/neatness of anesthesia area. 14. Preparedness. Failure to meet professionalism objectives may result in termination from the program. TIME COMMITMENT The student's time commitment during Phase I is approximately 60 - 70 hours during a seven-day week. This may vary from week-to-week depending upon the student and the testing cycle. The student's time commitment during Phase II should average between 55 - 64 hours per week and may vary from clinical site-to-clinical site. Each student will be assigned shifts other than day shifts. These shifts may include rotating call shifts, evenings, nights, weekends and holidays. This time commitment includes study time. One hour of classroom time generates three hours or more of study time. The clinical day, on average, involves 10 to 12 hours in the hospital. MINIMUM CASE AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia meet or exceed the general require- ments as set forth by the Council on Accreditation as stated in the Standards and Guidelines for Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs/Schools. Each RRNA is required to complete a 16 month full time clinical residency including a minimum of 650 diverse cases and all specific case requirements. The RRNA's level of preparation is a factor in determining case assignments. GRADING The graduate program at Texas Wesleyan University requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 for graduation. A course grade of \"B\" is required in the following courses: HSC 6603 Principles of Anesthesia Practice Physiology, and Pathophysiology II All Clinical Didactics Courses during Phase II A course grade of less than \"B\" in the above courses will result in dismissal from the program. A course grade of less than \"C\" in any course will result in dismissal from the program. No more than a total of two course grades of \"C\" will be acceptable. A grade of no less than \"B\" will be accepted in a course that is repeated. A grade is assigned for each Phase II Clinical Practicum. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 161 *Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA). READMITTED STUDENTS It is the intent and hope of the administration of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia that all students are successful in their attempt to complete the program. However, history tells us that this is not the case and that on average, approximately 12% - 15% of students are unsuccessful during Phase I of the program. Students who are unsuccessful on their first attempt at completing Phase I are eligible to request readmission to the program. Those selected for readmission are given the opportunity to repeat the entire first year. To start the process, the unsuccessful student must submit a written request for readmission to and receive approval to re-interview from the Program Director. If the student's failure to complete Phase I is due to academic performance, the student must also obtain approval from the instructor(s) in which grades less than \"B\" were made. Once approval for the re-interview has been granted, the student will be assigned a date and time to re-interview with the program's Admissions Committee. The decision to readmit a student is that of the Admissions Committee. All committee decisions are final and not subject to appeal. Once a student has been readmitted, he/she will take all of the Phase I courses with the exception of the fall semester Professional Aspects course, and, the spring semester Research course - providing that the student had previously passed these courses. The student must attend all program courses. For all courses that the student received the grade of \"B\" or higher, the student must agree to maintain the same course average or better. For all courses in which the student did not receive the grade of \"B\" or higher, the student must obtain a course grade of at least a \"B\". The readmitted student agreeing to the grade statements will sign a contract that identifies the requirements that the student must meet to successfully complete the program. The student will be assessed the current tuition and fees for each course that is being repeated if the student failed to achieve a grade of \"B\" or higher during the first attempt. The student will be assessed the current audit fees and the additional university fees for each repeated course in which the student achieved a grade of \"B\" or higher during the first attempt. The success rate for repeating students is high. Readmitted students are not guaranteed a specific clinical training location. Clinical assignments will be made based upon clinical site availability and will be made no earlier than the end of the spring semester. All students readmitted into Phase I must agree to the terms and conditions identified in the Readmitted Students Policy stated above. Students dismissed from the program during Phase II will not be considered for readmission. Readmitted students who are unsuccessful will not be offered another opportunity for readmission. Grade Description Grade Points P Pass 0.0* F Fail 0.0 Texas Wesleyan University 162 GRADUATE STUDENT OF NURSE ANESTHESIA CODE OF CONDUCT Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia at Texas Wesleyan University is a community of faculty, clinical instructors, support staff, and students involved in teaching, clinical training, and learning. Students are members of this community for the period of their registration in the program and as such assume the responsibilities that such registration entails. This program is dedicated to providing a quality comprehensive academic and technical education and considers the students as colleagues in the learning process. Nurse Anesthesia students are adults who are responsible for their own actions and who should be free to pursue their educational objectives in an environment that promotes learning and protects the integrity of academic process. The standards are designed to foster that environment. The Code of Conduct defines standards of student behavior during their enrollment in Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia and should be seen as a supplement to the Academic Integrity Policy in the Texas Wesleyan University Graduate Catalog and the Code of Student Conduct in the Texas Wesleyan University Student Handbook. Disciplinary procedures are detailed in the Student Handbook. Clinical students will also be held to the standards of professional conduct defined by their licensure and clinical facility. Standards of Conduct: Academic conduct will reflect the highest level of honesty and integrity both in the classroom and clinical area. Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated. Harsh penalties up to and including dismissal, will be imposed for failure to comply with these standards. Academic Dishonesty includes but is not limited to: \u00b7 Unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests or exams. \u00b7 Use of unauthorized material in carrying out assignments. \u00b7 Acquisition without permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a faculty or staff member. \u00b7 Illegal possession of questions or unauthorized notes or obtaining information from another student during an exam. \u00b7 Forgery or Plagiarism \u00b7 Lying \u00b7 Assisting others in committing academic dishonesty. \u00b7 Removing or reproducing test questions during or after the exam. \u00b7 Falsifying academic or clinical records. The student is expected to: 1. Demonstrate civil, courteous and respectful treatment of all of the members of the University Community. Faculty and staff are responsible for class requirements, content and classroom behavior. The students do not have the right to interfere with the freedom of the faculty to teach or the other students to learn. Violations include: a. Disruptive behavior in the classroom, office or clinical site. b. Disrespectful verbal, written or electronic communications with faculty, staff or other students. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 163 2. Demonstrate respect for personal, academic and physical property of all members of the University Community. a. All Blackboard material, both lecture notes and video recordings, are the property of the instructor and intended for use only by those enrolled in the course. b. Streaming video lectures are to be viewed live from Blackboard, downloading or copying is strictly prohibited. Violators will be dismissed from the program. c. Unauthorized copying or distributing of these materials is strictly prohibited and subject to disciplinary and/or legal action. d. Provision of unauthorized materials to underclassmen is considered a violation of this code. 3. Demonstrate group behavior that promotes respect and equality. 4. Demonstrate strict adherence to the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia's substance abuse policy. 5. Demonstrate compliance with the Code of Ethics for the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist as published by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. The AANA Code of Ethics is required reference material and can be purchased from the AANA. The Director of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia retains the right to dismiss a student from the program for grave offenses to the Code of Conduct. Violations of the student Code of Conduct will be handled according to the policies defined in the TWU Student Handbook and Graduate Catalog. The following is a brief outline of the process: 1. Preliminary faculty - student meeting 2. Report Form for Allegation of Academic Dishonesty submitted to the Dean. (Obtained from the office of the Provost) 3. Appeal process if appropriate a. Academic Judicial Board b. University Judicial Board c. The University Provost Graduate students are responsible for becoming familiar with the information included in the Texas Wesleyan Graduate Catalog, the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia Handbook of Didactic and Clinical Practice and Procedures, and the Texas Wesleyan University Student Handbook. These references will be issued during orientation with the Student Code of Conduct and receipt will be verified by student signature. Should conflict arise from the reference material, The Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia Handbook of Didactic and Clinical Practice and Procedures shall take precedence. PROBATION The Program Director may place a student on probation for failure to comply with any Professionalism Objectives. The terms and length of the probation is at the discretion of the Program Director. An RRNA may be placed on probation during Phase II if the student's performance is judged by the hospital Anesthesia clinical faculty to be unsatisfactory. Probationary status is the decision of the Clinical Evaluation Texas Wesleyan University 164 Committee (CEC), which will determine the specific objectives a student must meet in order to successfully complete the probationary period. The length of the probationary period is at the discretion of the CEC. Students who are unable to achieve probation objectives within the time allowed by the CEC are subject to dismissal from the program. AN RRNA IS SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY PROBATION IF AT ANY TIME THE STUDENT'S CONDUCT IS DOCUMENTED AS \"UNBECOMING TO A PROFESSIONAL.\" However, a student is not entitled to a probationary period prior to dismissal if the University's program director determines that immediate dismissal is warranted based on the nature of the student's conduct. The Professionalism Objectives are outlined in the Texas Wesleyan University Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia Handbook of Didactic and Clinical Practice and Procedures. DISMISSAL An RRNA is subject to immediate dismissal from Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia if at any time the student's conduct is documented as \"unbecoming to a professional.\" An RRNA may be dismissed from Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia for failure to: \u00b7 Satisfactorily complete Phase I within the allotted time frame as outlined in the program's curriculum; \u00b7 Meet minimum grade requirements; \u00b7 Meet any Phase I or Phase II probation objectives; \u00b7 Meet professionalism objectives; \u00b7 Comply with hospital policies and procedures; \u00b7 Fulfill clinical expectations; \u00b7 Provide for patient safety. Patient safety is a primary consideration for continuation in the program. Therefore, an RRNA may be dismissed from the program following a single documented incident where patient safety is severely compromised. Based on the circumstances of the incident, the hospital Anesthesia clinical faculty may bypass the probationary process. When such an event occurs, dismissal from the clinical training site is at the discretion of the hospital Anesthesia Director of the Anesthesia Department or designee. Dismissal from the program is at the discretion of the University's program director or designee. RRNA's shall adhere to affiliated hospital or clinic rules, regulations, policies, and procedures at all times during the period of instruction. The hospital or clinic may terminate an RRNA for flagrant or repeated violations of rules, regulations, policies, or procedures. The hospital reserves the right to take immediate action to remove an RRNA from the clinical setting when necessary to maintain the operation of its facilities free from interruption and/or to insure patient safety. The hospital and/or the hospital Anesthesia Department reserves the right to refuse to provide training to any RRNA. If an RRNA is terminated from a hospital or clinical site for any reason, the student is subject to dismissal from the program. Texas Wesleyan University is not responsible for placing the student at an alternative clinical site once dismissed from the program. Students dismissed from the program will be informed in writing. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 165 Additional grounds for probation or dismissal from the program may be included in the Texas Wesleyan University Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia Handbook of Didactic and Clinical Practice and Procedures. Texas Wesleyan University contracts with each clinical facility to provide clinical training to the students. Additional avenues for student dismissal may be included in the individual contracts. Where discrepancies exist between this manual and the contract, the contract has precedence. APPEAL Appeal of academic or performance probation or dismissal will be managed according to the program's policies and guidelines. All other student related matters are governed by the University's Student Handbook and the Graduate Catalog in effect at the time the student entered the program. Any student wishing to use the appeals process regarding an academic or performance issue, including hospital or clinical probation or other CEC sanctions, must notify the University's Director of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia in writing within 30 days of official notification of the action in question. All decisions of the program director related to clinical probation, CEC determinations, or a student's dismissal from the program are final and may not be appealed. Students retain the right to file a written student complaint with the Provost Office according to the procedure provided in this Graduate Catalog. However, the Provost Office cannot make any determination regarding competency or clinical performance. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students must notify the Director of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia in writing if a leave of absence becomes necessary. Documentation for the need of the leave of absence may be required for approval. Granting of the leave of absence is at the discretion of the Director. Regardless of the length of the leave of absence, the student must submit a written request for reinstatement to the Director. Documentation supporting the student's request for reinstatement may be required for approval. Reinstatement is at the discretion of the Director. During Phase I, the student must conform to policies set by Texas Wesleyan University (see Class Attendance in this catalog). During Phase II, a request for leave of absence is subject to approval by the Director. If the student is on probation or otherwise not in good standing in the program at the time the leave of absence is requested, the leave of absence may be denied. The Director will set the conditions required for reinstatement into training. At the discretions of the Director, these conditions may include requiring the reinstated student to review, retake, or audit selected didactic courses. Return to Phase II clinical training is contingent upon willingness of a clinical site to accept the reinstated student. A leave of absence in excess of the student's allowed vacation time may result in an extension of clinical training for the student to meet program completion requirements. Reinstatement into the program following a leave of absence in excess of six months may require the student to repeat all of Phase II training. Reinstatement into the program following a leave of absence in excess of one year may require the student to repeat some or all of Phase I coursework. All students required to repeat Phase I of the program upon reinstatement do so as a readmitted student and are subject to the Readmitted Student policy as published in this catalog. Regardless of the length of absence, the student must demonstrate the clinical and academic proficiency expected of a graduate nurse anesthesia student, as determined by the program and clinical staff, before the student will beTexas Wesleyan University 166 allowed to officially complete the program and become eligible to take the National Board on Certification and Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists' Certification Examination to become a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist. Students will have their leave of absence revoked and will be terminated from the program when their leave of absence extends to 18 months. SICK LEAVE Texas Wesleyan class attendance policy states that regular and punctual attendance at all scheduled classes is expected of all students. University regulations authorize necessary absences with the instructor's prior approval. Unauthorized absences may be excused when caused by illness or other emergencies and should be reported as soon as possible to the instructor and school office. At the discretion of the Director or Assistant Director, any student taking an unauthorized sick day may be required to provide a physician's excuse. The student is responsible for all class assignments missed because of absences. During Phase I, when a student has a number of unauthorized absences equal to the number of hours the class meets per week, the instructor of the class may drop the student from the class roll. A student dropped by the instructor for excessive unauthorized absences will receive the grade of \"DP\" (dropped). A student may be reinstated in the class with the consent of the instructor and the Director of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia. A student who has been absent from any regular examination and has satisfied the instructor that the absence was due to serious illness or other unavoidable cause may take a special examination at the discretion of the instructor concerned. Each RRNA is allowed 16 \"absent days\" during Phase II. From this 16-day allotment the RRNA subtracts her/his sick and vacation days. Absence from a clinical class will be counted as a sick/vacation day. If 16 days are exceeded, then the RRNA may be held past graduation on a day-for-day payback basis. Individual cases involving unusual circumstances may be taken under consideration by the Program Director. HOLIDAYS Phase I All University holiday and semester break periods to include are given the student. These include: Labor Day, Fall Break, Thanksgiving, Christmas/New Year, Easter, Independence Day, and Martin Luther King Day. Texas Wesleyan University will set the academic calendar with the exception of the summer I and II semester breaks. The summer calendar is shifted to allow students time to relocate to their primary clinical sites. These dates will be provided to students during orientation. Phase II The student will be granted hospital honored holidays which may include: Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas/New Year, Memorial Day, and Independence Day. These may not be given on the actual holiday. VACATION During Phase I, there are appropriate semester/summer session breaks that are recognized as vacation time. For Phase II, please refer to the section concerning \"Sick Leave\" above. Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 167 TRANSPORTATION Transportation to and from the hospital/University is to be provided at the student's own expense. IMMUNIZATIONS AND STUDENT HEALTH Each student must be in good physical and mental health, may not have any communicable disease when involved in patient care, and must have a medical questionnaire and physician's certificate on file at the University with proof of tuberculin testing and immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and rubella and all items listed in the Medical Requirement section of this catalog. If any student contracts a communicable disease, the student shall notify the Director or Assistant Director of the program as soon as possible after learning of same and shall be suspended immediately and indefinitely from the program until such time as the student is no longer infected with any communicable disease. HEALTH CARE INSURANCE During Phase I, students are advised to purchase their own health insurance as the University provides only minimal health care. During Phase II, students must provide their own health insurance. Proof of coverage will be required. Failure to provide proof of health insurance will result in the removal of the student from the clinical area until proof is provided. The student is not an employee of the University or the hospital where the clinical training is provided. The student is not covered by Workman's Compensation insurance and must use her/his individual health insurance to cover training related injuries (e.g. needle sticks, lifting injuries, etc.). EMPLOYMENT Although it is not recommended, students may be employed during their enrollment with the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia as long as there is no conflict in time between employment and program responsibilities. RRNA's may not work the shift prior to anesthesia-committed time during Phase II. Under no circumstance may an RRNA be employed to practice anesthesia in either title or function.

PHASE I: DIDACTIC CURRICULUM AND GRADUATION CRITERIA Phase I begins each fall at Texas Wesleyan University and is completed the following August. During this period, students earn 42 graduate credit hours. In order to begin Phase II of the program, students must complete Phase I within 12 months of the beginning of their course work. A student must have completed a minimum of 42 semester hours of work (Phase I) with a 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) overall grade point average. Long Distance Option The Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia offers two different, Council of Accreditation (COA) approved, long distance education options. Option 1: Students assigned to Primary Clinical Sites outside of the Fort Worth-Dallas metropolitan area may have the option to take Phase I Spring and Summer courses at assigned Primary Clinical Site. This option requires permission of the Program Director and the Primary Clinical Site Clinical Coordinator (not all clinical sites offer this option). Classes that are held at Texas Wesleyan are broadcast over video teleconferencing equipment. The broadcast is interactive (2-way audio and video). Arrangements are made to proctor tests at the distant site. A minimum number of 2-3 students per site must choose this option in order for it to be implemented at a particular clinical site. A Long Distance Fee of $80 per credit hour is charged (subject to change without notice). All students that choose this option are required to take Fall Semester courses on the Wesleyan campus in Fort Worth. If you are interested in this option, contact the Program Director or Admissions Coordinator. Option 2: As of June 15, 2004, the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia was approved by the COA to offer the entire didactic curriculum via the interactive video system to select primary training facilities at sites distant to the Fort Worth area. To participate in this option, the site chosen must be on Texas Wesleyan University 170 the list of sites selected by the Program Director to offer this option. A minimum number of 2-3 students per site must choose this option in order for it to be implemented at a particular clinical site. A Long Distance Fee of $80 per credit hour is charged (subject to change without notice). Students selected to participate in this option must attend classes on campus in Fort Worth for the first two weeks of the fall semester and two weeks during the spring semesters. If you are interested in this option, contact the Program Director or Admissions Coordinator. Students not assigned to a Primary Training Site that offers the Long Distance Option will not be allowed to take the Long Distance Option at another Primary Training Site that offers this option. Readmitted students must take all fall and spring classes on campus at Texas Wesleyan University. The option to take summer course at the student's newly assigned clinical site will be determined at the end of the spring semester by the Program Director. Students who are completing their Phase I coursework on campus may request to visit a Primary Training Site and participate in the long distance education for a short period of time. Permission must be obtained from the Program Director or Associate Director and the Clinical Coordinator at the Primary Training Site. PHASE II: CLINICAL CURRICULUM AND GRADUATION CRITERIA Upon completion of Phase I, students must immediately enter Phase II. This phase of the program provides clinical training to the student, lasts 16 months, and is built upon the material covered during the first phase of the program. The student must attend one two-hour clinically related course each semester during Phase II. Phase II consists of the actual administration of general and regional anesthesia with qualified clinical instructors (anesthesiologists and/or C.R.N.A.'s). Clinical Didactic courses are taught each semester during Phase II and cover topics related to advanced anesthesia practice. A grade of \"B\" must be achieved in each Clinical Didactic class. A single grade of \"C\" in a Clinical Didactics course may be retaken with instructor approval which will result in the extension of the student past the student's scheduled program completion date. A single grade of \"less than C\" or the second grade of \"C\" in a Clinical Didactics course will result in the dismissal of the student from the program. Hospital specific classroom sessions are provided the student at their clinical site and consist of clinical conferences; journal club; and seminars dealing with current topics including, but not necessarily limited to, respiratory, cardiovascular, thoracic, neuro, regional, obstetrical, pediatric, and special areas of anesthesia. Various special projects and competency examinations are administered throughout this phase. Upon successful completion of Phase II, the graduate is awarded a Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia, receives a certificate in anesthesia, and becomes eligible to take the National Certification Examination for Nurse Anesthetists given by the National Board on Certification and Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists. A graduate successfully completing this exam is awarded the title of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (C.R.N.A.). Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 171 Requirements for graduation with a Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia and an anesthesia certificate from Phase II include satisfactory completion of: 1. All case and course requirements; 2. A professional paper; 3. All written and oral examinations; 4. All financial obligations to the program; and 5. All published program requirements. OUTCOME-BASED NURSE ANESTHESIA EDUCATION The responsibility of the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia is to provide for each resident those learning opportunities that stimulate critical thinking, communication, valuing, aesthetics, professional development, independent judgment, and clinical skills. We accept the concept that learning produces a change in behavior and is a continuous process of relating new knowledge and skills to previous and concurrent experiences. It is the gradual internalization of book knowledge and the correlation of principles to clinical experience. Learning goes beyond knowing \u2014 to being able to do what one knows. We strive for the professional nurse anesthetist to be prepared to think critically and creatively, to exercise discriminative judgment in the application of principles they have learned, and to establish good interpersonal relationships for continued personal and professional growth. Overall program and professional outcomes: \u00b7 Implement a philosophy of nursing based on the intrinsic worth of each human being (patient, resident, and faculty); \u00b7 Provide clinical learning that must be integrative and experiential, active and interactive, developmental and transferable; \u00b7 Promote clinical abilities that foster communication, analytic capability, problem solving and valuing in decision-making. This is a reflective, transferable process that involves the ongoing integration and application of specialized knowledge, attitudes, and skills; \u00b7 Develop knowledge and skills in each resident that are necessary for promoting leadership, acting as a change agent, and interdisciplinary collaborator for the improvement of health care. Graduate outcomes: \u00b7 Demonstrate the ability to administer individualized safe anesthesia based on pathophysiologic principles, recognize changing conditions of the patient, and correctly alter the anesthesia management; \u00b7 Obtain and document pre-anesthesia interviews (include history, physical, and assessment) and informed consent (include risks, complications, and anesthesia alternatives). Suggest/order preoperative tests and medications. Develop an appropriate anesthetic care plan based on patient history and proposed surgical procedure; \u00b7 Select, assemble, and maintain proper equipment, anesthetic agents, and accessories while preparing for an anesthetic \u2014 general, regional, MAC; \u00b7 Conduct a physiologically sound anesthetic during induction, including positioning of the patient to assure optimal physiologic function and safety, and appropriate management of the patient's airway; Texas Wesleyan University 172 \u00b7 Administer physiologically sound anesthesia maintenance within the confines of the operative, diagnostic, and therapeutic situation and the pathological condition of the patient; \u00b7 Manage a physiologically sound anesthetic emergence within the confines of the operative, diagnostic, and therapeutic situation and the pathological condition of the patient; \u00b7 Evaluate post-anesthetic recovery of the patient in terms of recognizing complications arising from the anesthetic management and recommend/take a course of action for correcting such complications within medically established guidelines. Provide a safe transport for the patient and effectively communicate the condition of the patient to the recovery personnel; \u00b7 Demonstrate responsibility for own actions and for continuing personal and professional growth; \u00b7 Exhibit expected role responsibilities, maintaining integrity, and legal/ethical standards; \u00b7 Function within appropriate legal requirements as licensed professional, accepting responsibility and accountability for own practice. Perform clinically in ways that reflect specialized knowledge, attitudes, skills, motivations, and self-perceptions; \u00b7 Adhere to all OSHA and HIPPA/HITECH guidelines. Rights of Patients: 1. The patient has the right to know that a nurse anesthesia resident is participating in their anesthesia care; 2. The patient has a right to expect that the nurse anesthesia resident is supervised by a qualified, credentialed anesthesia provider; 3. The patient has a right to expect safe, quality anesthesia care anytime a nurse anesthesia resident is involved with their care; 4. The patient has a right to expect the nurse anesthesia resident maintain patient confidentiality. Anesthesia Care Plans: \u00b7 Each RRNA will complete anesthesia care plans for her/his patients. Forms are provided. Pre-Anesthetic Visit: \u00b7 Each patient assigned to an RRNA will be visited pre-operatively by the RRNA; \u00b7 A reasonable attempt should be made to see the patient the day prior to scheduled surgery. Post-Anesthetic Visit: \u00b7 Each patient anesthetized by an RRNA will be visited post- operatively by the RRNA; \u00b7 A reasonable attempt should be made to see the patient the day after the surgery. If approved by the clinical site, telephone calls are an acceptable alternative for outpatients; \u00b7 This visit is an evaluation in the immediate recovery phase and again in the post-recovery phase within 24 hours. It allows the student to evaluate her/his anesthetic technique and management. A post- operative visit promotes a positive relationship between the student and the patient. It provides a means for the patient to express his or her fears of surgery and obtain answers to any post-operative questions. It also enables the student to emphasize the guidelines Master's Program in Nurse Anesthesia 173 introduced during the pre-operative visit for a smooth recovery. The Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs requires that a student nurse anesthetist conduct a post-anesthesia assessment on each patient that the student anesthetizes, except ambulatory care patients and early discharges (01.15.02). Clinical Evaluations: \u00b7 The RRNA will actively seek evaluations from the clinical instructors at all times; \u00b7 Case evaluation forms are available in the anesthesia department or from the clinical coordinator. These forms are to be utilized and shared with the RRNA. The completed forms are returned to the Clinical Coordinator; \u00b7 Evaluation forms, stored in the anesthesia department, are available to all clinical instructors. Each clinical instructor is asked to regularly complete these forms and return them to the Clinical Coordinator; \u00b7 Each RRNA is required to make an appointment with the Clinical Coordinator at least every three months for purposes of evaluation and counseling. Appointments may be made more frequently as necessary. SEE EXAM All Phase II students are required to take the SEE exam during the summer or early fall semester of their last year. Information concerning the SEE exam will be provided the student well in advance of the actual testing date. The fee for the SEE exam is the responsibility of the student. REVIEW COURSES All Phase II students are encouraged to take a board review course in the spring of their last year. This is not a requirement but is strongly encouraged. All costs and fees associated with the taking of the review course are the responsibility of the student. Each student will be given a travel day on each side of the review course if the course attended is not local to the training site. Authorized travel days are not counted as \"absent days\" and do not have to be made up. Affiliations In response to the Department of Health and Human Services' Study of Nurse Anesthetist Manpower Need (Feb. 1990), Texas Wesleyan University has been able to increase the number of students who are able to enroll in our program by developing a number of primary clinical affiliations offering Phase II. The Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs defines a required (primary) clinical site as \"an institution where students receive 50% or more of their total clinical experience.\" REQUIRED (PRIMARY) SITES AND CLINICAL COORDINATORS A clinical coordinator facilitates clinical education in the hospital setting.

(Fall) Texas Wesleyan University 180 DOCTORAL PROGRAM IN NURSE ANESTHESIA John E. Martin, CRNA, MSN, MSNA, Director Ricardo E. Rodriguez, Ph.D., Associate Director Paul Austin, Ph.D., Coordinator of Nurse Anesthesia Curriculum Degree and Programs D.N.A.P. Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice Accreditation The program is approved by the Council on Accreditation (COA) of Nurse Anesthesia Education programs, a specialized accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education. Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP) The Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice Program provides Master's level prepared Nurse Anesthetists with advanced studies that leads to a Practice Doctoral Degree. The program is designed to provide scientific enhancement of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist's (CRNA) current knowledge and to develop administrative skills in both management and/ or nurse anesthesia education. The program provides advanced studies in the interrelationships of Pathophysiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology, study of management theory, educational administration and an advanced research project. The program is designed to provide students the opportunity to complete the 38-45 credit hour programs on a part-time basis in three years or two years as a full-time student. The program builds upon the scientific and leadership knowledge and skills that the student gained during their Master's Degree nurse anesthesia education as well as from their professional practice experience gained as a nurse anesthetist. The successful student will develop advanced, in-depth scientific knowledge concerning the disease processes and treatment modalities and strengthen the leadership, administrative and management skills beyond that gained at the Master's level. Two foci are offered in the program, and students may choose to complete one or both: Education Administration The education administration courses will provide the knowledge not offered in most Master's level CRNA curriculums. With the development of clinical doctoral programs for advanced practices nurses, both in anesthesia and other advanced nursing specialties, the need for doctoral prepared program administrators is great. The goal of the education specialty focus is to prepare the CRNA to administer a doctoral level program, including curriculum development and assessment. Doctoral Program in Nurse Anesthesia 181 Management The management focus courses will provide the knowledge necessary to advance into administrative roles in the anesthesia department/group or other areas in the clinical facility as well as the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge to create and operate an anesthesia group. These skills will include budget management and the contract and legal issues associated with the creation of a business. Program Length/Structure The program is provided in an online format only and designed to be completed on a part-time basis in three to five years. The program may be completed in two years of full-time study. Graduate Faculty in the DNAP Program The graduate faculty is comprised of faculty members whose experience and record of scholarship qualify them to offer graduate instruction.

Transfer Credits Candidates for the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP) must complete all Texas Wesleyan University Doctorate Program in Nurse Anesthesia Practice courses. No courses may be transferred into the program to meet program completion requirements. Time Limitation Graduate courses expire within seven years from the date of course completion shown on the transcript; thus, at the time the student graduates with the DNAP degree, no course may be more than seven years old. In the event that the required course is no longer offered, a substitute course of similar content must be taken in it's place. Approval to take this course must be obtained from the Director of the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice program. This applies to all courses taken at Texas Wesleyan University. Grading Grading for each course will be identified in each course syllabus. No final grade assigned for a graduate/doctoral level course may be raised unless an error has been made. The substitution of a different course for one completed with a lower grade is not permitted. Students wishing to raise a grade in a completed course must retake the completed course and pay full tuition for that course. The student must first gain approval from the course instructor and then petition the Graduate Advisory Committee to the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice Program through the Director of the Doctorate in Nurse Anesthesia Program. The decision of the committee is final and cannot be appealed. \"Incomplete\" grades must be removed by the date designed in the University Calendar. On or before the designated date, the instructor will assign a grade and report it to the Office of Student Records. If a new grade is not reported by the designated date, the \"I\" will automatically convert to an \"F\". Texas Wesleyan University 184 Academic Probation Doctoral degree students who have been accepted into the DNAP program must maintain a 3.0 cumulative grade point average for all graduate courses.
