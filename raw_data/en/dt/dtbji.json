What's New Version 1.8.0 Bug fixes. General stability updates. Ratings and Reviews I'm a homeopath, and I love this app! Super helpful app, I love it. Great for on the go, quick remedy comparisons, checking highly-indicated remedies for specific complaints. I have tons of homeopathy books, but this is super handy and reassuring to have with me on my phone wherever I go. It is well-organized and has a fairly large materia medica! It's a great resource for people new to homeopathy, I wish I had this back when I was a young mom just discovering homeopathy and how to use it. Does not replace consulting a professional homeopath when necessary, but a great aid for at-home acute prescribing and learning! Impressive Im impressed with this app. I have been able to find a lot of recommended homeopathic remedies for things that I've tried numerous over the counter products before. I have chronic sinusitis and drainage that causes coughing and clearing my throat. I found items from the app that helped my system heal itself. OTC products were making it worse or I was having to continually use. And I don't have to call my homeopathic friend all the time for suggested remedies. I can find them myself now. Thank you. Synaptic, clear app about homeopathy This app is synaptic and very well organized for me. I am still learning about homeopathy as a mom of two kids and I was looking for some simple help. I can find here description of health problems and their symptoms with each recommended remedy. Also each remedy is described here too. It is possible to buy course for therapy of ADHD and potency&doses. I am happy I purchased this app and can recommend to others.
