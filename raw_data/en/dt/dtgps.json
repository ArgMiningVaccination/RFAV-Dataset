I was first introduced to the magical, beautiful yerba mate during my particularly difficult and [rare spiritual awakening](https://strengthessence.com/spiritual-awakening-signs/) by my spirit guides and instantly felt better after drinking it. My nerves were calmed, my racing mind was clearer, and my mood instantly improved. Since then, my spirit guides have told me that Yerba Mate is a \"Master Teacher\" and helps to \"uplift\" and \"enlighten\". My favorite method for consuming this spiritual awakening herb is in [Organic Yerba Mate Tea](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Ancients-Organic-Yerba-Ounce/dp/B00C9UO7YY?dchild=1&keywords=yerba+mate+tea&qid=1613967960&sr=8-26&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=e4c1fc46eac9591fbbbe8ab80472bbeb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) with [Organic Almond Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Organic-Almond-Beverage/dp/B07HL1NRGQ?dchild=1&keywords=organic+almond+milk&qid=1613968165&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=a1172fc2625918e48e2e4bb3094bed8c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and [Raw Organic Honey](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Nates-Unfiltered-Brazilian-Wholesome/dp/B01IR6J4CI?dchild=1&keywords=raw+organic+honey&qid=1613968234&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=2624bf294275abeef6a053ac39f12c07&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). 2.

Besides calming the nervous system, lavender connects me to my spirit guides and angels in a very strong way, because I am matching their vibration when I use it. My favorite method for using lavender is ingesting it in this amazing super-bioavailable [Organic Lavender Extract](https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-FREE-Lavandula-Angustifolia-Glycerite-Supplement/dp/B01A3PAUJ2?dchild=1&keywords=organic+lavender+extract&qid=1613968925&sr=8-9&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=3b6d8417036125097f2ae4eaee4c6884&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) or an [Organic Lavender Tea](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Tea-Lavender-Herbal-Loose/dp/B00EVJURRM?dchild=1&keywords=organic+lavender+tea&qid=1613968997&sr=8-10&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=7769235f1d1e73580e4751953dc5262a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

Always use a carrier oil when applying essential oils to the skin! They are very strong! 3. [Whole Life-Cycle Mushrooms](https://www.amazon.com/New-Chapter-Reishi-Mushroom-Ingredients/dp/B0038ZYGD6?keywords=New+Chapter+immune&qid=1561443532&s=gateway&sr=8-3&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=84d16e231a0534146f072a2d1cbbbd0d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) During my spiritual awakening, I was given the guidance to eat more mushrooms to help me with awakening, particularly [Opening my Third Eye Chakra](https://strengthessence.com/how-to-open-your-third-eye/). You don't have to get \"magic mushrooms\" with psilocybin to have spiritual experiences! My spirit guides instructed me to use whole life-cycle mushrooms to assist with spiritual awakening. Whole life-cycle mushrooms are blends of mushrooms that contain ground up parts of all the cycles the mushrooms go through including: the mycelium, primordia, fruitbodies, and extracellular compounds produced throughout the entire life cycle of the mushroom. These mushrooms naturally contain beta glucans, digestive enzymes, fiber, prebiotics and antioxidants! While researching this, I found two incredible companies on the internet making whole life-cycle mushrooms, New Chapter and Om. I've personally used and loooove both brands! [New Chapter LifeShield Immune Support](https://www.amazon.com/New-Chapter-Reishi-Mushroom-Ingredients/dp/B0038ZYGD6?keywords=New+Chapter+immune&qid=1561443532&s=gateway&sr=8-3&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=5821615860efb4fe1b193f7c991c084d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) comes in pill form and contains the whole life-cycles of 7 mushroom types. [Om Organic Mushroom Nutrition Immune Powder](https://www.amazon.com/Om-Organic-Mushroom-Nutrition-Supplement/dp/B00MY4OH7W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3NSS84IJTCU49&keywords=om+immune+organic+mushroom+powder&qid=1561443632&s=gateway&sprefix=om+imm,aps,211&sr=8-3&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=93d0a8d8b519994e78248568218771f5&language=en_US) is cheaper per serving and virtually tasteless when mixed with water. It is great in soup, smoothies, tea, or coffee! Their mushrooms are also ID tested and carefully grown! If you don't love supplements, you can simply eat more mushrooms to help with spiritual awakening, but you won't be getting the whole-life cycle mushroom. 4. [Yarrow Flower](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Yarrow-Tea-Caffeine-Free-Bleach-Free/dp/B00QMO2RJU?dchild=1&keywords=organic+yarrow+root&qid=1614028757&sr=8-10&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=12246e25f1922919cddf0774d846c1ad&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Yarrow is a superstar herb for spiritual awakening. It awakens the [Pineal Gland](https://strengthessence.com/decalcify-pineal-gland-calcification/) and opening your third eye to the higher dimensions, especially during sleep. This magical aromatic wildflower assists with [Lucid Dreaming](https://strengthessence.com/lucid-dreams/) and [Astral Projection](https://strengthessence.com/astral-projection/) and can help you [Remember Your Dreams](https://strengthessence.com/remember-dreams/) to retain their spiritual awakening lessens. You can brew some [Organic Yarrow Flower Tea](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Yarrow-Tea-Caffeine-Free-Bleach-Free/dp/B00QMO2RJU?dchild=1&keywords=organic+yarrow+root&qid=1614028757&sr=8-10&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=12246e25f1922919cddf0774d846c1ad&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) before meditation or bed to help you have the spiritual awakening experiences you seek. 5. [Iron](https://www.amazon.com/Garden-mykind-Organics-Organic-Plant-Sourced/dp/B018KVB3BK?dchild=1&keywords=garden+of+life+iron&qid=1614029312&sr=8-9&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=e6e426685a19333a8abdfff3c55e55b0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Included in my [5 Magic Hacks for Reaching Higher States of Consciousness](https://strengthessence.com/secrets-reaching-higher-consciousness/) post, iron is an incredible way to \"turn on\" and \"tune in\". I began taking iron while I was pregnant and noticed some incredible spiritual awakening experiences. My intuition was heightened. I sensed more with my clairaudience, [Clairvoyance](https://strengthessence.com/clairvoyant/), [Claircognizance](https://strengthessence.com/claircognizant/), and [Clairsentience](https://strengthessence.com/clairsentient/). My guides told me \"iron turns us on and tunes us in\". I'm guessing it's because iron circulates more oxygen through the bloodstream, and oxygen contains the \"Infinite Intelligence of Creator\". I often take this [Organic Plant-Based Liquid Iron](https://www.amazon.com/Garden-mykind-Organics-Organic-Plant-Sourced/dp/B018KVB3BK?dchild=1&keywords=garden+of+life+iron&qid=1614029312&sr=8-9&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=e6e426685a19333a8abdfff3c55e55b0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) before writing, channeling, and meditating to help receive more Divine guidance as I do so. 6. [Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-Certified/dp/B07XHMCKXV?dchild=1&keywords=braggs+apple+cider+vinegar&qid=1614029897&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=ae99d12fc051e0e4c08cb70acc64cd2a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) If you don't already take apple cider vinegar, I suggest you start. It is amazing at detoxing your pineal gland and whole body system, which assists in spiritual awakening. The less toxins weighing down your body and brain during spiritual awakening, the better. I prefer [Bragg's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar with \"the Mother\" Enzyme](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-Certified/dp/B07XHMCKXV?dchild=1&keywords=braggs+apple+cider+vinegar&qid=1614029897&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=ae99d12fc051e0e4c08cb70acc64cd2a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_t). I like to mix mine with water since it is strong. You can also take [Organic Apple Cider Vinegar Pills](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-Capsules/dp/B07DWGQ1P5?crid=1CR2OYTP2XYR8&dchild=1&keywords=organic+apple+cider+vinegar+pills&qid=1614030167&sprefix=organic+apple+cid%2Caps%2C218&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyNjJCTkxYMzUxRkRJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDE0NjEyMVo0NEY4UU1FV1QwWiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDAzMDM3SEhVUTg4MkwzN01EJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=6db220a935bc4da48f7ec233eb47a6d6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) if the thought of drinking it turns you off. 7. [Raw Cacao](https://www.amazon.com/Milliard-Organic-Powder-Non-GMO-Gluten/dp/B07SQB7ZJN?dchild=1&keywords=organic+cacao&qid=1614030610&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=ffa0c73ca663eaafad55d95f49286232&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Often used for ceremonial purposes, raw cacao strengthens your spiritual sight and helps you go deeper into meditation, channeling, and Shamanic work. Raw cacao can also helps you gain insight into love, purpose, and strengthens intuition. Raw cacao has been called, \"The Food of the Gods\", which I totally agree with! It is an incredible food for spiritual awakening! In my most recent experience with a raw cacao ritual, I drank it in a tea mixed with honey, cinnamon, cayenne, and almond milk. It was delicious and I had the most amazing lucid dream that night! In the lucid dream, I was shown that it was the raw cacao that had strengthened my spiritual sight enough to produce the lucid dream. I love [Organic Raw Cacao Powder](https://www.amazon.com/Milliard-Organic-Powder-Non-GMO-Gluten/dp/B07SQB7ZJN?dchild=1&keywords=organic+cacao&qid=1614030610&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=ffa0c73ca663eaafad55d95f49286232&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) mixed with hot water and honey for a delicious adult hot chocolate. 8. [Chlorella & Spirulina](https://www.amazon.com/Chlorella-Spirulina-Superfoods-Minerals-Chlorophyll/dp/B01DPW5JSW?dchild=1&keywords=organic+chlorella+spirulina&qid=1614033505&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVjlZQzA5NjJWVkFUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTcxNjU2MUpKQU1TRU41SFpKTCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjk1MDU3MlRWMVg4TzMzTkFNVCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=97b1afd25785e887d9aeecf6bf560f5d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) A highly concentrated complete protein superfood, [Chlorella and Spirulina remove heavy metals, fluoride, and the Pineal Gland](https://strengthessence.com/decalcify-pineal-gland-calcification/). A strong decalcified pineal gland supports spiritual awakening in incredible ways. It opens your intuition, third eye sight, and helps during the dream state. Chlorella and spirulina also support your spiritual awakening body with nutrients that are extremely easy to digest and use. I love this brand of [Organic Chlorella Spirulina Tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Chlorella-Spirulina-Superfoods-Minerals-Chlorophyll/dp/B01DPW5JSW?dchild=1&keywords=organic+chlorella+spirulina&qid=1614033505&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVjlZQzA5NjJWVkFUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTcxNjU2MUpKQU1TRU41SFpKTCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjk1MDU3MlRWMVg4TzMzTkFNVCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=97b1afd25785e887d9aeecf6bf560f5d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)! 9. [Sananga](https://psychedelictimes.com/the-long-burn-a-30-day-sananga-challenge/) Sananga is a potent, and when I say potent, I mean very powerful and to be used in moderation eye medicine made from a shrub found in the Rain Forest. I recently had the opportunity to try sananga as one of a few cleansing herbs for spiritual awakening on a spiritual healing retreat to Moab, Utah. My spirit guides explained that it is \"potent\" and very \"energetically cleansing\" for spiritual awakening. Sananga eye drops however, are not for the faint of heart as they burn and sting your eyes for 10 - 15 minutes. Sananga has been said to help open the third eye chakra and many report \"seeing\" a lot of psychic information upon using them. However, I didn't experience any third eye visuals while using sananga. But, I have noticed an increase in ease, joy, and clarity since trying it. Sananga is less readily available than other foods and herbs for spiritual awakening, but can be [purchased here](https://psychedelictimes.com/the-long-burn-a-30-day-sananga-challenge/). 10. [Mucuna](https://www.amazon.com/Maximum-Strength-Organic-Mucuna-Pruriens/dp/B01BHF3J4K?dchild=1&keywords=mucana&qid=1613964039&sr=8-9&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=7e5c2abb9a0854d41e3d247ccfaaff49&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) One of the most incredible herbs for spiritual awakening is mucuna. Grown in jungle regions near the equator, mucuna comes from the velvet bean plant and contains high levels of L-Dopa, a precursor to dopamine. This helps mucuna stabilize and improve your mood, but it also contains trace levels of DMT, which is an active ingredient in ayahuasca and peyote. These lower levels of DMT (produced by the pineal gland), make it safe to consume without having the adverse reactions many report from plants such as ayahuasca and peyote. The pineal gland has been called \"The Seat of the Soul\" and contains vast amounts of information important in the spiritual awakening process. It is considered by many to be a \"second spiritual eye\" after the third-eye chakra, which is also used for spiritual sight. Although mucuna is not classified as a psychoactive or psychedelic plant (since the levels of DMT are minute), it is still considered a powerful spiritual awakening herb and consciousness expanding plant medicine. [Organic Mucuna Powder](https://www.amazon.com/Maximum-Strength-Organic-Mucuna-Pruriens/dp/B01BHF3J4K?dchild=1&keywords=mucana&qid=1613964039&sr=8-9&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=7e5c2abb9a0854d41e3d247ccfaaff49&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is readily available on Amazon and also in many local health food stores. It can be mixed into a ceremonial tea, or added to soups or smoothies for an energy and anti-inflammatory boost as well. 11. [Raw Organic Honey](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Nates-Unfiltered-Brazilian-Wholesome/dp/B01IR6J4CI?dchild=1&keywords=raw+organic+honey&qid=1614034806&sr=8-11&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=506056716b5e40d62362c7f3d4dbffae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Another food for spiritual awakening rather than an herb for spiritual awakening, raw organic honey does incredible, magical things for the body and spirit. Honey, especially raw and organic holds a very high vibration and assists with third eye awakening as well. My guides remind me to eat [Raw Organic Honey](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Nates-Unfiltered-Brazilian-Wholesome/dp/B01IR6J4CI?dchild=1&keywords=raw+organic+honey&qid=1614034806&sr=8-11&linkCode=ll1&tag=strengthess07-20&linkId=506056716b5e40d62362c7f3d4dbffae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) all the time and often say \"Honey is money for spiritual awakening!\" Related Posts you may like: [The Ancient Meditation for Reaching Higher States of Consciousness](https://strengthessence.com/ancient-meditation-technique-reaching-higher-states-consciousness/) [Ascension Symptoms (2021 Little-Known Empath Protection Tools](https://strengthessence.com/empath-protection-tools/) Final Thoughts on 11 Magical Herbs for Spiritual Awakening These magical foods and herbs for spiritual awakening will strengthen your intuition, [third-eye chakra development](https://strengthessence.com/developing-third-eye-chakra/), and increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming, visions, and spiritual messages reaching you in [mindfulness meditation](https://strengthessence.com/ultimate-beginners-guide-mindfulness-meditation/).
