Please note that though we are not physicians, nor do we have any medical background as such, I can share with you my personal story of using the [Detox and Cleanse Activated Charcoal Powder](https://buyactivatedcharcoal.com/activated-charcoal-health-products/detox-1600-usp.html) and how it helped with serious brain fog that resulted after I had the lower half of my mercury amalgams removed. Activated charcoal can actually adsorb mercury along with other toxic chemicals and substances. Once it has adsorbed a toxin, it will not let it go unless it reaches extremely high temperatures (600+ degrees Celsius). As a result, you do not have to worry that your body will reabsorb the trapped material, it will not. The charcoal has bonded to the toxic waste and it will remain as if sealed inside the charcoal as it passes through your body. Why I Followed a Detox Protocol Of course, as a preventive, I was taking large amounts of the Detox and Cleanse before and after my amalgams were removed. At that time, I was not taking the charcoal on a daily basis, I was only doing this to be on the safe side. I wanted to do all I could to protect myself, as I had read horror stories where people were worse off after their amalgams were removed than before. I do not remember exactly how many days or how many slurries I drank per day before and after my dental procedure. However, it was no more than a week on either side, obviously not enough. I also cannot recall when exactly the brain fog started to settle in, but I do remember being 'foggy' and not myself. For whatever reason I was not taking my charcoal. It was as if I was strangely accepting this fogginess. Then one day at work, a friend of mine who was also our shipping manager then, was getting unusually frustrated with me. I was getting so forgetful and asking the same questions over and over...Suddenly she loudly exclaimed \"I just told you that, you keep asking the same questions. Are you getting Alzheimer's or something?\" It was like a slap on my face, but I will be forever grateful she said this to me. At the time I was truly feeling foggy. I simply set down whatever I was doing on the table and left the office to go home. I can still remember; it was like I was walking through invisible walls as if in a dream. Soon I was walking through the back door of my home and I headed straight to the kitchen cupboard where I kept the Detox and Cleanse. I cannot say definitively how much I took, but I can tell you, lots and lots! I put several tablespoons in one glass and quickly drank it. I repeated that several times a day for the next few days. For me, it was nothing short of a miracle, the results were simply amazing. About day three of constant charcoal slurries all day long, it was quite apparent to myself and others, that my brain had cleared! I jumped for joy inside, I was so amazed and happy! The days following, I contemplated what had happened and how scary it was that I had accepted the fogginess. How could I have accepted the fog in comparison to the sharp clearness that the charcoal had brought me. As I pondered this, I remembered a customer that had a clinic (not an MD). He used a 13-week charcoal protocol for brain detoxing. In his practice he helped many, but one of his most miraculous testimonials was regarding a street druggy that regained a clear mind after using an immense amount of charcoal internally. 'I need to do this,' I thought to myself, 'who knows how much mercury got dumped into my system when I had the mercury amalgams removed?' Being that I do not take any prescriptive meds** (please see our disclaimer below) I then decided to complete the 13-week protocol this man had shared with me. I wasn't really expecting much as the brain fog had cleared, however, I wanted to really nail it down. I figured I had nothing to lose. How I wish now that I had kept a journal. I could share exact times and dates, but I did not. Nevertheless, I can still share with you the process I went through. The 13-Week Protocol | | Weeks 1-3 |Take 1 Heaping Tablespoon of Detox and Cleanse Charcoal Powder at the Following Times With a Large Glass of Water| | | 6:00 AM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 10:00 AM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 2:00 PM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 6:00 PM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 10:00PM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | Weeks 4-13 |Take 1 Heaping Tablespoon of Detox and Cleanse USP Charcoal Powder at the Following Times With a Large Glass of Water| | | 6:00 AM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 3:00 PM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water | | 10:00 PM | | 1 Tablespoon | | with Water After the 13 weeks, you then choose your maintenance dose. I chose one heaping tablespoon of the Detox and Cleanse with a small amount of warm water just before retiring each evening. My Reflection and Personal Benefits Because I did not keep a journal, I cannot say exactly when this happened, but it was approximately about seven or eight weeks into the protocol. I noticed that my bowels were sloughing what I soon learned to be parasites, of which one was huge. At first, I was alarmed at what I saw, a twisted rope like snake. I quickly tried to reassure myself by the realization that I actually felt great. A few quick clicks on the internet and there I found the disgusting parasites in living color, which was intriguing and a great relief. After the parasites moved on, the detox was rather uneventful, or so I thought at the time. One day, while reflecting on my 13-week charcoal protocol, it hit me like a jolt of lightning. I no longer had my chronic Candida infection, I was 100% free! Ever since I was a little girl, I battled strep throat about once a month. The pediatrician knew me so well that she would order two antibiotic shots. One the first day I came in and then another booster shot of antibiotics the following day. When I became a little older, around age seven or eight, they started to give me oral antibiotics along with the shots! Ugh......Even as a child I had yeast infections all the time. I accepted it as something I had to live with. In my late teens, I did not get strep every month, but still would succumb to it at least two to three times a year. I dealt with this on and off until age 27. I finally had my tonsils removed, that was the end of my strep throat, but not my yeast infection. Yes, I tried herbs and supplements, but nothing worked and really it was just a way of life for me, an unpleasant annoyance. I was so used to the Candida, that I did not know what life was like without it. For this reason, it was quite a shock that I no longer had a constant yeast infection. No more pads and increased energy! I mentioned earlier, choosing a maintenance level. I chose to do a heaping tablespoon every night. However, every now and then I would give myself a break and quit the charcoal for a couple of weeks. Then I would go back onto my maintenance level of a heaping tablespoon each night. About three days in, I would start to notice that my mind was clearer. After going on and off for some time, I finally asked myself, 'why am I going off the charcoal when I definitely feel so much better when I am on it all the time?' From then on, it has become a nightly ritual, and if I perchance forget to take it in the evening, then I do so first thing in the morning. Regardless of how well, and organic, we try to eat and drink, there is no way we are not taking in toxins and contaminants. The charcoal that I drink on a daily basis is my preventative for what is slipping by in the food and liquids I consume each day. I remained healthy and Candida free until last December when I had purchased some raw milk from some folks that keep a few wet cows. After my second purchase my dreaded Candida came back and I was horrified. Later, I learned that one of their cows had mastitis and they gave it an antibiotic. The antibiotics were now in me, and with it came my dreaded old enemy. Therefore, I quickly upped my heaping tablespoon to two heaping tablespoons each night. Additionally, I was taking at least two heaping tablespoons in the morning. In about two weeks the yeast infection disappeared. From that point on, I chose to continue on with my two heaping tablespoons in a small amount of warm water each night and I have not had a recurrence since, almost one year later. Other positives for me of this protocol and taking charcoal daily, is that it keeps my middle age brown spots at bay. I still have a few light ones, but far less than when I did not take the charcoal on a daily basis. Of course, the [Charcoal Soaps](https://www.buyactivatedcharcoal.com/activated-charcoal-for-health-and-beauty/charcoal-soaps.html) that I use help as well. I know that it is the daily routine that really caused most of my brown spots to disappear and brighten my skin tone. I do not wear any make up whatsoever, and occasionally people will comment on how healthy my skin looks. They think that I am younger than I am, which is always a day brightener for an old girl like me! I hope my journey will help you and make you wonder how charcoal might benefit you as well. Please note that with any such protocol, it is always best to seek the advice of a trusted health care provider. I am only sharing my experience and am not advocating that others try this and if they do, they do so at their own risk.
