[Ozone therapy](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/ozone-therapy-treatment/) is form of alternative medicine which is based on the introduction of 'ozone' (e.g activated oxygen) into the body through various routes (such as the rectum, the vagina, intravenously, and subcutaneously). It has been suggested as a treatment or therapy for conditions such as [AIDS](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/aids), [multiple sclerosis](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/multiple-sclerosis), and [arthritis](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/arthritis), along with disc problems such as herniated discs. Such claims lack significant evidence and research is limited. Why is it done? Ozone is said to enhance the circulation and cause 'inactivation' of bacteria, viruses, and yeast in the body. As an alternative therapy, it may be used to improve how the body takes in oxygen and how it uses the oxygen once inside the body. It is also said to help activate the immune system, and speed up the healing process. What does it involve? Ozone therapy can be applied in various ways, including through the vagina, through the rectum, under the skin (subcutaneously), through a vein (intravenously), and through a muscle (intramuscular application). Ozone can also be administered in other ways, such as through injections, a gas bath or sauna, or through ozonated water, drunk by the individual undergoing therapy. There is also a specific type of ozone therapy called autohaemotherapy, which involves withdrawing blood, mixing it with ozone, and putting it back into the patient's bloodstream. Alternatives to this treatment Ozone therapy is an alternative therapy itself, and should only be done under medical supervision. If you are interested in receiving ozone therapy, talk to your doctor or visit a specialist who can advise you on the best method of treatment for your condition before alternative therapies are considered.13-11-2012 13-06-2023 Ozone therapy [ Dr Gina Schoeman - Updated on: What is ozone therapy?
