AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY; and THE SCHOOL BOARD OF PINELLAS COUNTY, Defendants. DEFENDANT AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY'S NOTICE OF REMOVAL PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Defendant Aetna Life Insurance Company (\"Aetna\") hereby remove s this case from the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida, to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida , Tampa Division . In support of this Notice of Removal, Aetna states the following: I. NATURE OF THE REMOVED CASE 1. Plaintiff Scott Lake (\"Lake\") filed this civil action against Aetna and the School Board of Pinellas County (the \"School Board\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") on October 30, 2020, in the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida , Case No. 20-005171 -CI Action\"). 8:20-cv-03010Case Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 1 of 11 PageID 12 2. Plaintiff asserts claims in the State Court Action on behalf of himself and a nationwide class of alleged similarly situated individuals. See generally Class Action Complaint , Lake v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. et al. , No. 20 -00517 1-CI (Fla. Cir. Ct. Oct. 30, 2020) (attached hereto as Exhibit A) (\"Compl.\") . He alleges that his wife is \"an Aetna policyholder with self -funded insurance plan through her employer, the School Board and [he] is covered as a defendant under that policy.\" Compl. \u00b6 8. He further alleges Defendants wrongfully denied coverage under the plan for a treatment called Proton Beam Radiation Therapy (\"PBRT\"). Id. \u00b6 9. He alleges the treatment was wrongfully denied as an \"experimental or investigational\" cancer treatment under Aetna's generally applicable policy , referred to as the \" PBRT Clinical Policy Bulletin .\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 35-38. 3. Plaintiff purports to represent a nationwide class and two subclasses.1 The Complaint defines the \"Nationwide Class\" as: All participants or beneficiaries in non -ERISA plans underwritten or administered by Aetna Life Insurance Company, who, citing the application of the PBRT Clinical Policy Bulletin, were denied health insur ance coverage for Proton Beam Radiation Therapy to treat their cancer, on grounds that included the assertion that it was \"experimental or investigational \" or not \"medically necessary. \" The Nationwide Class includes both persons whose post-service claims for reimbursement were denied and persons whose pre-service requests for authorization were denied. Id. \u00b6 68. 4. The \"Florida Subclass \" is defined as: All participants or beneficiaries in non -ERISA Plans underwritten or administered by Ae tna Life Insurance 1 Aetna relies upon Plaintiff's allegations regarding the nature of the putative classes solely for purposes of asserting jurisdiction under CAFA. Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 2 of 11 PageID 23 Company under Florida law who, citing the application of the PBRT Clinical Policy Bulletin, were denied health insurance coverage for Proton Beam Radiation Therapy to treat their cancer, on grounds that included the assertion that it was \"experimental or investigational \" or not \"medically necessary. \" The Florida Subclass includes both persons whose post-service claims for reimbursement were denied and persons whose pre-service requests for authorization were denied. Id. \u00b6 69. 5. Finally, the \"Pinellas County Subclass \" is defined as: All participants or beneficiaries in non -ERISA plans underwritten or administered by Aetna Life Insurance Company for the School Board of Pinellas County, who citing the application of the PBRT Clinica l Policy Bulletin, were denied health insurance coverage for Proton Beam Radiation Therapy by the School Board to treat their cancer, on grounds that included the assertion that it was \"experimental or investigational\" or not \"medically necessary.\" The Pi nellas County Subclass includes both persons whose post -service claims for reimbursement were denied and persons whose pre -service requests for authorization were denied. Id. \u00b6 70. 6. The Complaint asserts unjust enrichment claims against Aetna on behalf of the putative Nationwide Class (Count I) and the putative Florida Subclass (Count III) and a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 86.011 on behalf of the putative Florida Subclass (Count IV) . The Complaint also asserts a claim against the School Board for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing on behalf of the putative Pinellas County Subclass (Count II) . Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 3 of 11 PageID 34 II. THIS COURT HAS ORIGINAL JURISDICTION UNDER CAFA. 7. This Court has original jurisdiction over the State Court Action under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\") , 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d) , \u00a7 \u00a7 1441(a) and 1453 . The State is a \"class action\" as defined in CAFA because it was filed under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.220, which is a \"rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by 1 or more representative persons as a class action .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(1)(B). 8. \"CAFA permits the removal of class actions to federal court where the putative class action includes 100 or more members, at least one plaintiff is diverse from one defendant, and the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.\" Anderson v. Wilco Life Ins. Co. , 943 F.3d 917, 924 \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d), 1453) . \"Unlike in ordinary cases, there is no presumption against removal in CAFA cases .\" Anderson , 943 F.3d at 925 (emphasis added) . CAFA 's \"'provisions should be read broadly, with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant .'\"2 Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens , 574 U.S. 8 1, 89 (2014) (quoting S. Rep. No. 109 -14, p. 43 (2005)) (emphasis added) . \"While a court may decide that some of a plaintiff's claims lack merit in the context of a motion to dismiss, such considerations are inappropriate as part of a jurisdictional analysis.\" McDaniel v. Fifth Third Bank , 568 F. App'x 729, 731 (11th Cir. 2014 ) (holding that district court erred when it refused to consider the amount of damages 2 This presumption in favor of exercising federal jurisdiction differs from the approach in non-CAFA cases, where courts \"are encouraged to resolve all doubts about jurisdiction in favor of remand to state court.\" Garcia v. Wal -Mart Stores E., L.P. , No. 6:14-cv-255-Orl-36TBS, 2014 WL 1333208, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 2014). Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 4 of 11 PageID 45 flowing from plaintiff's fraud claims based on its determination that those claims failed as a matter of law). A. Minimal diversity of citizenship is satisfied. 9. This is a controversy between citizens of different states , which satisfies the minimal diversity requirement of CAFA . 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2)(A). 10. The Court may look to a notice of removal and any documents attached thereto for purposes of determining diversity in a remov ed action . Pretka v. Kolter City Plaza II, Inc. , 608 F.3d 744, 752 (11th Cir. 2010); see also Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc. , 613 F.3d 1058 (11th Cir. 2010). 11. The Complaint alleges that the putative class representative is a citizen of a state different from one of the defendants. Plaintiff alleges that he \"is a citizen of Florida who resides in Pinellas County, Florida.\" Compl. \u00b6 7. Plaintiff further alleges that \"Defendant Aetna is a Connecticut corporation with its principal place of business in Hartford, Connecticut. \" Id. \u00b6 9. 12. Aetna is a citizen of Connecticut because it is incorporated and maintains its principal place of business in that state. Because Plaintiff alleges he is a citizen of Florida, t he minimal diversity required under CAFA exists between at least one proposed class member and one defendant. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2). B. The amount -in-controversy requirement is satisfied. 13. This case satisfies CAFA 's amount -in-controversy requirement because the aggregated potential value of the putative class members' claims exceed s $5 million , exclusive of interest and costs. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1332(d) (2), (6). Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 5 of 11 PageID 56 14. \"The amount in controversy is not proof of the amount the plaintiff will recover. Rather, it is an estimate of the amount that will be put at issue in the course of the litigation.\" Pretka , 608 F.3d at 751 (quotation omitted). It is well established in the Eleventh Circuit that the amount -in-controversy requirement is satisfied when \" it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requir ement. '\" Id. at 754 (quoting Williams Inc. , 269 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir. 2010)).3 In addition to relying on the factual allegations in the Complaint, a removing defendant may rely on \"reasonable deductions, reasonable inferences, or o ther reasonable extrapolations\" of the relief requested by the plaintiff in alleging that the requirement is satisfied . Id. \"Just as [the court] generally accept[s] the plaintiff's good - faith allegations of the amount in controversy to establish diversit y jurisdiction, 'when a defendant seeks federal -court adjudication, the defendant's amount -in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.'\" Roppo v. Travelers Commercial Ins. Co. , 869 F.3d 568, 579 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Dart Cherokee , 574 U.S. at 82) (footnote omitted). In considering these allegations, the court must \"aggregate the claims of individual class members and consider the monetary value that would flow to the entir e class if [injunctive or] declaratory relief were granted.\" Anderson , 943 F.3d at 925 (quoting S. Fla. Wellness, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 745 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2014)). \"Once the proponent of CAFA jurisdiction 3 See also Roppo v. Travelers Commercial Ins. Co. , 869 F.3d 568, 579 (7th Cir. 2017) (stating that amount can be calculated by reference to, inter alia , Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., Greek Yogu rt Mktg. & Sales WL (W.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2015) (discussing \"long lines of precedent in both the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits permitting removing defendants to rely on the state court complaints alo ne to establish the jurisdictional minimums, without resort to extrinsic evidence\"). Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 6 of 11 PageID 67 has explained plausibly how more than $5 million is at stake, federal jurisdiction attaches unless it is legally impossible for the plaintiff to recover that much.\" McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 12:6 (16th ed.) (emphasis added) . 15. Plaintiff purports to represent a nationwide class of individuals covered by non-ERISA Aetna plans who were denied coverage for PBRT based on the PBRT Clinical Policy Bulletin . Compl. \u00b6 68. Plaintiff alleges that he \"personally paid over $78,000 for [PBRT] treatment out -of-pocket.\" Id. \u00b6 66. He also alleges that \"PBRT has become so widespread that at a minimum, requests numbering in the hundreds, if not thousands, must have been submitted to and denied by Aetna for coverage of this therapy.\" Id. \u00b6 75. He seeks a damages award on behalf of a nationwide class . Id. \u00b6 94. He also seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief , and attorneys' fees . Id. at 28 (Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 B, H) . His request for equitable relief includes \"disgorgement and surcharges.\" Id. (Prayer for Relief \u00b6 B). He also seeks an order directing Aetna \"to reprocess\" claims \"without application of the PBRT Clinical Policy Bulletin \" as well as an order directing Ae tna \"to create a common fund out of which it will make payment, with interest, of any unpaid benefits\" to Plaintiff and putative class members. Id. (Prayer for Relief \u00b6 \u00b6 D, F). In essence, Plaintiff requests full coverage and/or reimbursement for PBRT on behalf of himself and any non-ERISA Aetna insured, nationwide, who was previously denied coverage for the treatment. 16. It is apparent fr om the face of the Complaint that the aggreg ate value of the relief requested exceeds $5 million. If one infers that the purported class members are each seeking similar amounts as Plaintiff pleaded ( i.e., approximately $78,000), and that the putative class consists of \"hundreds, if not thousands\" of members as pleaded, it is Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 7 of 11 PageID 78 reasonable to extrapolate that the relief requested exceeds the $5 million threshold amount for CAFA jurisdiction . Pretka , 608 F.3d at 754 (stating that the jurisdictional threshold is satisfied based on \"reasonable deductions, reasonable inferences, or other reasonable extrapolations\" of the relief requested by the plaintiff ); see also Todorovich v. Accrediting Bureau of Health Educ. Sch -20744 -CIV, 2017 7726729, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 2 5, 2017) (finding jurisdictional threshold satisfied where plaintiff acknowledged her individual claim totaled $21,975.44 and sought to represent a class of at least 400 people , thus establishing an amount in controversy of more than $8 million ). 17. Thus, the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold , and the amount -in-controversy requirement of CAFA has been satisfied .4 C. Venue is proper in this district and division and the other statutory requirements for removal have been satisfied . 18. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) because the Circuit Court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida is within that federal district and division . The Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, encompasses Pinellas County, Florida, where the State Court Action was filed . 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(b) . 4 In addition, the exception to CAFA jurisdiction for class actions against state actors does not apply because not all defendants are state actors. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(5 )(A); see also , 771 F.3d 1257, 1263 (10th Cir. 2014) (concluding that there is \"no doubt Congress intended the state action provision to preclude CAFA jurisdiction only when all of the primary defendants are states, state officia ls, or state entities\"); Frazier v. Pioneer Ams. LLC , 455 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting view that remand is proper where one primary defendant is indisputably a state entity and concluding that the plain language of \"\u00a7 1332(d)(5)(A) is clear \u2014all primary defendants must be states\" for the provision to apply). It is beyond dispute that the School Board is a state entity and Aetna is a private entity. Separately, the exemption for classes of \"less than 100,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(5)(B), does not app ly because Plaintiff alleges a nationwide class consisting of \"hundreds, if not thousands\" of class members, (Compl. \u00b6 75). Case 8:20-cv-03010-VMC-TGW Document 1 Filed 12/17/20 Page 8 of 11 PageID 89 19. This Notice of Removal was timely filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 14 46(b) and 1453(b) because Aetna was served with the summons and a copy of the Complaint on November 18, 2020 and is filing this Notice of Removal within thirty (30) days of service. 20. A copy of this Notice of Removal is bei ng filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida, as provided by law. Aetna will provide written notice of the filing of this Notice of Removal to Plaintiff, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d), by service on counsel. A completed Civil Cover Sheet accompanies this Notice of Removal. 21.

WHEREFORE, Aetna respectfully request s that (1) th e State Court Action be removed to this Court, (2) this Court exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over this action, and (3) the Court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper.
