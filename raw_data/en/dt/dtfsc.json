Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection It is an immuno biological substance designed to produce specific protection against a given disease . It stimulate the production of protective antibody & other immune mechanisms Live attenuated vaccines Prepared from live ( generally attenuated ) organisms . eg : BCG - pox , - Viral Organisms killed by heat or chemicals , when infected into the body stimulate active immunity Safe but generally less efficacious than live vaccines eg : Typhoid ,Cholera , polio ) , Hepatitis A & B , etc - Viral Certain organisms produce exotoxins, these toxins are detoxicated and used in the preparation of vaccines Highly efficacious & safe eg: Diphtheria, Tetanus - Bacterial Vaccines which are prepared from extracted cellular fractions Duration of experience is limitted& their efficacy and safety is high eg: Meningococcal vaccine , Pneumococcal vaccine, Hepatitis B polypeptide vaccine If more than one kind of immunising agent is included in the vaccine it is called mixed or combined vaccine eg: DPT- Diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus DT- Diphtheria-tetanus Hepatitis A& B Hepatitis A & typhoid characterstic killed vaccine Live vaccine No of dose Multiple Single Need for adjuvant Yes No Duration of immunity Shorter Longer Immunoglobulins prodused IgG IgA &IgG Stability at room temperature High Low Vaccine reaction Common , minor , more serious - reactions Local reacton , fever & systemic symptoms can result as a part of immune responds . A successful vaccine reduces these reactions to a minimum while producing the best possible immunity. VACCINE POSSIBLE MINOR ADVERSE REACTION BCG Local reaction ( pain , swelling , redness ) CHOLERA Oral presentation - none DTP Local reaction ( pain ,swelling , redness) Fever HEPATITIS A Local reaction (pain ,swelling ,redness) TETANUS Local reaction (pain swelling , redness) Malaise & non specific symptoms Common side effects of any vaccine can include: Injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) Mild fever. Shivering. Fatigue. Headache. Muscle and joint pain. Natonal Immunization Shedule The first visit when infant is 6 weeks old 2 &3 rd visits - at intervals of 1 to 2 months Oral polio vaccine may be given concurrently with DPT IMMUNOGLOBULINS Human immunoglobulin system - 5 major classes - IgG , IgM , IgA , IgD , IgE & their subclasses IMMUNITY Immunity is defined as the capacity of the body to resist pathogenic agents. It is an ability of body to resist the entry of different types of foreignbodies. Antisera or antitoxins The term antiserum is applied to materials prepared in animals Originally passive immunisation was achieved by the administration of antisera or antitoxins prepared from non human sources (horse) Administration of antisera may occasionally give rise to serum sickness & anaphylactic shock due to abnormal sensitivity "}
