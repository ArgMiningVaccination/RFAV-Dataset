An autism conference in Melbourne on Friday heard parents were being bombarded with useless and sometimes dangerous ''therapies'' such as hyperbaric oxygen chamber sessions, which can cause seizures and lung problems if not used properly, and chelation - an intravenous infusion of chemicals designed to remove heavy metals from the body. Chelation has killed three people overseas since 2003, including a child with autism, and studies of its use in rats have been halted due to brain damage. Professor Andrew Whitehouse, director of the Autism and Related Disorders research unit at the University of Western Australia, said that while there was a booming market for anything thought to treat or cure autism, there was no scientific evidence to support many complementary and alternative ''medicines'' for the condition. He said a systematic review of published research into commonly used products and treatments found the only one that worked was melatonin to aid sleep. There was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support gluten and casein-free diets, secretin (a hormone that controls secretions in the small intestine), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vitamin B6, fish oil and immune therapies such as immunoglobulin. There was also no scientific evidence to support homeopathy, ''bowel bleaching'' or chelation. Professor Whitehouse said there was some evidence that music therapy and massage could aid sleep, but no studies had measured the benefits of yoga for autism. Despite this lack of research, he said, a survey of 169 families of autistic children found 54 per cent used one or more complementary or alternative medicines for autism. This was was troubling, he said, because people can already pay more than $30,000 a year for evidence-based treatments for a child. ''This is a vulnerable group of people ... Parents go looking for answers and they will find these things everywhere on the internet,'' said Professor Whitehouse who also works for Australia's Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism Spectrum Disorders. While anecdotal reports for unconventional treatments can sound persuasive, Professor Whitehouse said, they were not enough to prove something was effective. He said that if there was a promising complementary or alternative therapy for autism, scientists would want to rigorously test it to measure its effects. ''I think there is this absolutely false assumption that scientists are in on a conspiracy theory to suppress anything that they are not interested in. My experience is that this is 100 per cent incorrect. Scientists are desperate to make a difference to the lives of people with autism. If that proves to be in a complementary or alternative medicine ... it makes no difference to us,'' he said. Dr Julie Green, executive director of the government-funded Raising Children Network said if people were interested in the evidence for various autism treatments, they should visit the site for ''quality assured and rigorously validated'' advice.
