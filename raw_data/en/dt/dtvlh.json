When I was a baby, I was captivated by the abacus. It embodies the \"digit\" in a tangible form: beads that you can directly touch and feel. As a child, the abacus became a musical instrument, an imaginary toy train, and a back-scratcher because of its transparency and aordance, things that are missing in our current digital computers with a silicon black box inside. When my mom was busy with her bookkeeping, the music of the abacus let me knowthatIcouldn'taskhertoplaywithme.Theabacusbecametheambientmediathatmade me aware ofwhat my mom wasdoing inour smallapartmentin Tokyo. Orrery I visited the Collection of Historical Scientic Instruments at Harvard University in April 1996, and was struck by the beauty of the Orreries. An Orrery, one of my favorite tangible artifacts, represents our human knowledge of the solar system. I am deeply inspired by the aesthetics and rich aordances of historical scientic instruments, most of which have disap- peared from schools and laboratories, and have been replaced with general-purpose pixels on screens.Throughgraspingandmanipulationoftheseinstrumentsthroughthehandle,students who study astronomy can then be part of the solar system, and the movement of the planets around the sun is completely in sync with the senses of kinesthesia Tangible Representation of Astronomical Knowledge: Grand Orrery in Putnam Gallery, Harvard Univer- sity (photo by Sage Ross, CC-BY-SA 3.0) Closing Ihavetoacknowledgeandthankmanyvisionarypioneerswhoshapedthedigitallandscapeof today and built the new eld of computation for humanity, including Dr. Douglas Engelbart, Dr.IvanSutherland,Dr.MarkWeiser,Dr.AlanKay,andProf.BillMitchell,whoinspiredall of us and encouraged me to embody my dream of tangibles in the past quarter-century with amazing colleagues in the TEI, HCI, and MIT Media Lab communities.

It is a story that is already many thousands of years old; yet also one thatis verynew,swiftlyblossoming ingrowthand vitality. For eons, our identities, habitats, and social interactions have been deeply rooted in phys- icality. Our bodies are physical; our world of things moveable and immoveable by our naked hands, also physical. Since the dawn of humanity we have also been creators and users of tools. Some of these are largely mechanical in nature - amplifying or transforming our abili- tiestoliftorgrasp.Othersareseenastoolsforthought-tohelpusremember,communicate, and compute. While we might view the hammer and the abacus primarily as tools of force or thought, respectively, they both engage our body and our mind. The choice of tool also has great implicationsfor whatcan beexpressed.As hasbeen noted: \"What you play with governs what you play, as you will soon discover if you try playing footballwith ashuttlecock orping-pong witha puck.\"[Parlett1990] Further, our tools as well as the objects we create when using them are nuanced in their con- stitutionsandexpressiveness.AsnotedinthisinsightfulcharacterizationwithinEncyclopedia Britannia: \"as with some other arts, the practice of architecture embraces both aesthetic and utilitarian ends that may be distinguished but not separated, and the relative weight given to eachcan vary widelyfrom worktowork.\"[Ackerman et al.2000] This assessment is broadly descriptive of design in general, and specically of this arts, andfar beyond. A related modern example can be seen in the successes of Apple Computer (at times the But also critically, we see Apple's design approach of recent decades, aligned with Sony, Braun, Ulm, and Bauhaus philosophies from earlier decades [Cain], as neither stronger or weaker exemplars toward TEI's past and future than the profoundly dierent design perspec- tives of 1920s Art Deco, (\u00ea \u0017d), BCE 1500s Minoan, BCE3000 aboriginal design from countless cultures (most tragically extinct), and 2030 and 2330 genres of cyberphysical interaction devices deeply entangled with tech- nologies yet to be conceived. This constellation also speaks to the relevance of physicist and philosopher FreemanDyson's\"cladeand clone\" concept: In biology, a clone is the opposite of a clade. A clade is a group of populations sharing a common origin but exhibiting genetic diversity so wide that they are barredfrominterbreeding.Acloneisasinglepopulationinwhichallindividualsare genetically identical. Clades are the stu of which great leaps forward in evolution aremade. Clonesare evolutionarydead ends,slowtoadaptand slowto evolve.... All this, too, has its analog in the domain of linguistics. A linguistic clone is a monoglot culture, a population with a single language sheltered from alien words and alien thoughts. Its linguistic inheritance, propagated asexually from generation to generation, tends to become gradually impoverished.... Linguistic rejuvenation requires the analog of sexual reproduction, the mixture of languages and cross- fertilization of vocabularies.... In human culture as in biology, a clone is a dead end, aclade isa promiseof immortality. Are we to be a clade or a clone? This is perhaps the central problem ourprecious biologicaland cultural diversity?[Dyson 1979] Synergistically, TEI draws great power from the evocative diversity of our physical world and social relationships. From a technology perspective, this is both distinguished from and complemented by the \"black mirror\" monoculture of contemporary multitouch devices. And from sociocultural and environmental perspectives, the potentials of TEI - both for good and ill - are profoundly amplied by the material and cultural diversity of our global cultural inheritance. This is not merely a gift; it is also an existential expectation, voiced in unison byour ancestors andour children'schildren.

For example, in some technology-oriented courses, we recommend jumping from chapter 1 to chapter 5, toward swiftly engaging project envisionment and implementation; then alternating between earlier and later chapters for broader and deeper conceptual background.

And in resonance with the deepening challenges and demands of our times, we aspire for TEI engagement with broader societal and sustainability challenges that will pro- foundly(re)shape ourchildrenand grandchildren'sfutures. If we, as a TEI community, will reach our envisioned futures and impacts remains a question.Meanwhile,thisbookchartsbothhistoryandaspirationssurroundingthisrelatively new discipline, and contemplates how we have and might realize culturally and materially sustainable futures. TEI systems consume material and energy; can they also reduce and transform material and energy consumption? Computational technologies have often sought to divorce themselves from physical reference to any particular culture; can TEI usher in ecologiesofproductsdeeplysituatedwithinnichephysicalandculturaltraditions?Weseesuch challenges as deeply important and worthy of engagement by many. In the coming pages, we examinemanydiversetrailblazingworks,andprovidewiderangingconceptualandpragmatic tools and open-source exemplars, toward weaving the animating res of computation and technology into evocative tangible forms, toward presence and action on many varied roads ahead.

We Embodied Interaction Computation, and especially its endowment with interactivity, has become one of the most transformative forces impacting human engagement with our world. Today, virtually every facet of human engagement has been touched, and often transformed, by the power of com- putation. While some computational systems remain \"below the surface,\" without obvious indication of activity to lay observers, interactivity typically provides the face and hands of computation intothe realm ofhuman experience. In the rst decades of digital computation, both the input and output to computational systems was generally physical [Bush 1931; Ceruzzi 1981; Hartree 1946]. For example, with the 1940s ENIAC computer, data input and output was channeled via paper card or tape [Alt 1972], with programs and their parameters expressed through thousands of cables, sockets, knobs,andswitches[Wilkes1967].InfluencedbypioneeringsystemssuchasSAGE[Astrahan et al. 1957; Wikipedia d] and Sketchpad [Sutherland 1964; Sutherland et al. 1969], the input and especially output of computational systems has progressively shifted to virtual, screen- based forms.

Tangible interfaces aim to engage the human senses, physical and cognitive capabilities, our cultural traditions and physicalhabitats,and express this meaning. The study of Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) spans philosophy, psychology, and theory; computing; electrical and mechanical engineering; making, design, art, culture; and well beyond.

Some of these are summarized in Figure 1.2. This is organized to express both the longevity of such practices, dating back at least tens of thousands ofyears;and thegeographicaland culturaldiversity ofsuch practices. This is a tiny sampling of the great breadth of relevant examples. As indication, a small subset of such artifacts cast in the context of \"physical visualizations\"2contains hundreds of examples[wiki].Beyondthehistoryitself,wendmanyoftheseobjectssuggestiveoffuture potentialforcomputationalmediationanduse,infashionscelebratingtheirdistinctiveorigins and cultural contexts. As one of the older, best known, and (long ago) perhaps most widely used examples, clay accounting tokens were used in Mesopotamia for thousands of years (Figure 1.3) [Hockett 1960;Schmandt-Besserat2007, 1996;Ullmer2002]. Web companion 1.2 (ch1/gs/a2) Clay accounting tokens (Wikimedia) Concept: These physical tokens were used for bartering. Their discrete physical form facilitated both the negotiation process, and the keeping of records. In early generations, each token might represent a single cow or amphora (\u00edvat) of olive oil. In later iterations, tokens represented multiple cows, amphora, etc. After a bartered negotiation and agreement was complete, the tokens are thought to have been embedded within clay \"envelopes\" as formalizations of contracts. The tokens were frequently pressed on the exterior of the clay envelope to assist identication of their contents. (It is possible that the concept of \"breaking a contract\"may haveliteralorigins inthese claycontract-envelopes.) Inlater variations, they wereinscribedwithmarkingssuchaslines,dots,andcircles[Schmandt-Besserat2007; Ullmer 2002]. Some of these forms and inscriptions were representational; others, more abstract. Of these, Schmand-Besserat writes: \"the conceptual leap was to endow each token shape... with aspecicmeaning.Consequently,unlikemarkingsontallieswhichhadaninnitenumberof possible interpretations, each clay token was itself a distinct sign with a single, discrete, and unequivocal signicance. While tallies were meaningless out of context, tokens could always be understood by anyone initiated into the system.\" [Schmandt-Besserat visualization\" have been used as terms to describe the use of physical artifacts and the physical medium to visualize data of various forms.

In time, this evolved to stylus-based inscriptions upon tablets, then parchment,andonwardtoourpresentandfuturewritingsystems,alongwithmanyentangled technologies. Philosophy and cognition: Clay tokens served not only as an accounting system, but also as a coordinated system for categorizing and communicating certain relationships within the world.Theyenabled\"referenceinabsence,\"facilitatingcommunicationandnegotiationabout (e.g.) cows and olive oil without directly manipulating the entities themselves. This may also have held religious or spiritual signicance: \"The existence of such taboos [relating to literal representation] could explain, in fact, the earliest adoption of 'arbitrary' symbols or tokens... perhaps a compromise between the signicance of the emblem and the insignicance of the pebble.\"[Harris1986]. Aspirations: In their\u00edve thousand years of use, clay accounting tokens can be seen as an underlying medium enabling new forms of numeracy, commerce, and (through their evolution to written language) literacy. They can also be seen as engaging new audiences and introducing new forms of negotiative human interaction through their accessability and breadth of use. While their use faded some ve thousand years ago, these accomplishments hold strongrelevance andprospective parallelismtoour present, andprospectivefutures.For example, with the rise in primacy of video and image on the Internet, as marked by channels including YouTube, Instagram, and Netflix, some write of \"post-textual\" futures [Kova/uni010D and van der Weel 2018; Manjoo 2018]. Especially amidst such trends, our attention is among our most limited human resources, rendering new mediums and mechanisms for engaging and helping us manage our attention - such as tangibles - correspondingly precious. Just as \"post-textual\" does not imply \"non-textual,\" neither tangibles nor any medium are, across all contexts, \"better\" or absolute replacements for their alternatives. But the clay accounting tokens, and our coming examples, illustrate some of the moments, places, and contexts in which tangibleshave andcould holdcompelling roles. Exp ressing relationships and computational thinking to w a rd b roader audiences: the Slot Machine Many precedents, practices, and potentials for TEI are interwoven with education.

Fabrication was with hand-cut transparent acrylic, with slot colors expressed by the insulation of the interconnecting wires. The slot machine was initially used to control mechatronic LOGO \"turtle\" robots. Later, they also controlled (or could have controlled) virtual screen-based turtles (potentially including large numbers of virtual or physical robots, as investigated within Resnick's StarLogo system [Resnick1996]). Philosophy and cognition: Many of the concepts children manipulated with the Slot Ma- chine are known to be challenging to much older students. For example, an with Perlman's 1976 observation in the context of engaging children as youngasfourine.Ofthis,Perlmanwrote:\"Anotherdesignissueishoweasythesystemshould make it for the child to achieve interesting eects. If it is too hard, the child will become bored with doing rather mundane projects and will become discouraged if he tries anything harder....WiththeSlotMachine,itis,ifanything,tooeasyforthechildtoachievespectacular results\" [Perlman 1976a]. This speaks to implications of toward enabling and facilitating \"computational thinking\" [Wing 2006]. We elaborate on many specic cognitive aspects underlying the Slot Machine example, including external representations,Fr\u00f6bel's gifts, andPiaget'scognitive theorieswithinChapter3. Aspirations: As perhaps the rst tangible interface backed by digital computation, the Slot Machine in some respects anticipates and inspires most TEI activity, past and future. It remains a deeply provocative example of tangible tools for computationally facilitating child learning - a theme within which hundreds of systems have since been developed [Horn et al. 2012; Marshall 2007a; Price et al. 2003; Resnick et al. 1998].

Block System (BBS) [Aish Noakes 1984a] (see Figure 1.5) and Universal Constructor [Frazer et al.1980a] (shownin Figure 1.6). Concept: Both the BBS and Universal Constructor centered around modular systems of instrumented physical blocks. The conguration and manipulation of these blocks could be sensedandmediatedbyseveralformsofcomputationalsystems.ForBBS,thismediationoften took place via text and graphics on a proximal computer screen. With Universal Constructor, thisdisplaywasoftenviaconstellationsofLEDswithineachofdozens(sometimeshundreds) of physical cubes. With BBS, one particularly notable example application related to energy consumption. As architects or their clients reconnected BBS blocks to shape a prospective building of varying spatial prole (e.g., taller vs. wider realizations of a given floorspace), the projected energy consumption across time of day and time of year were visualized on the screen. For Universal Constructor, one example \"content\" was cellular automata \"contained\" within each cube, representing (e.g.) prospective movements of human habitants within the structure. Design:ForBBS,eachmoduletooktheformofanoversized,opaqueLEGO-likeblock. These could be mechanically interconnected, much as their smaller LEGO kin; with the structure sensed by integrated electronics. The screen-based mediation can be regarded as a kind of \"magic mirror\" [Grosjean and Coquillart augmentationsfromthe associatedsimulations. WiththeUniversalConstructor,withworkingprototypesrealizedin1979and1980,phys- ical cubes were used as the constructive element. Here, the cubes' transparent walls exposed theirLED,microprocessor,andsupportingelectromechanicalenablers.Thiscouldberegarded ascomplementingthecomplexdanceoftheirlitcellularautomatabehaviorwiththeevocative complexity oftheir underlying implementation. Technology: For sensing the conguration of blocks within the BBS, Aish describes a tree-based scanning system by which complex, many-layered block combinations could be be interrogated using serial communication protocols. He describes plans to reduce these electronics to a single custom VLSI CMOS chip. (It is unclear how microcontrollers or microprocessors were used in practice.)

In a1993versionwithTomasQuijanoandManitRastogi,thesystemwasgloballyinitializedand synchronized by a strobe flash, with each autonomous cell communicating via infrared with neighboringcells [Frazer 1995]. Cognition: Aish focused on implications of his work for facilitating collaboration, espe- cially between experts and broader populations. \"It is suggested that the most important po- tential contribution... will be to enhance the relationship between the client and the design team.... It will be possible for the architect to directly demonstrate to clients... modifying the model of the proposed building and presenting the resultant changes in the predicted costs and performance\" [Aish 1979].3This is resonant with theories of distributed cognition, an approach which \"explores how cognitive activity is distributed across internal human minds, external cognitive artifacts, and groups of people, and across space and time\" [Zhang 1997]. Distributedcognitionand\"cognitioninthewild\"[Hutchins1996]willbeelaboratedinChap- ter 3. Aspirations: Aish, Frazer, and their collaborators pioneered at least two major themes: (building)architecturalapplications(oftenengagedandpublishedwithinprofessionalcontexts of that discipline); and constructive representations of cyberphysical content.

E.g., in the book InteractionDesign:BeyondHuman-ComputerInteraction,Bishop'svisioniscelebratedinthe rst Co-Founder Line-us is also tomake sure theywork, sell andcan bemade. In the early 1980s, I was introduced by my friend and fellow student Chris Murray to the work and ideas of young postmodern product designers grappling with the question 'how should a physical product represent its purpose?' I realised then that chips were replacing mechanics - in the process, breaking the foundations of formal design. A product's form, which makes it recognisable, was no longer being derived from the relationship between its mechanical elements and its use. I went back to college in the early 1990s to explore the question, 'how do we actually read our environment through objects? - which leads to 'how do the objects represent their role in new man-made systems?' This work from the early 1990s relates closely to the origins of Tangible and Embedded Computing: how we use the properties of physical objects to represent and manipulate new systems. We are all brought up to move fluidly through the world, subconsciously reading our environment and the physical representations of our society, yet we don't tend to use thistacitphysicalknowledgewhenwecreatethecomputationalrepresentationsofsocial systems,appsorsites.Thetendencyistosumupagroupofideasintoaniconandlegend forabutton.Theiconisaxedsymbolforanideaandthebuttonjustinvitationtocarry out the idea. A physical tool, like a ruler, is far more complex than a button labeled measure - it describes the idea of a unit of length and its form lets you compare this against other physical objects. Our understanding of the ruler's properties also allows us tomanipulateitincountlessnumbersofways.TangibleComputingtakesthisfurtherand places actions within a physical context.Forexample, a digitallyaugmented rulermight be placed between two ideas on a map to measure theirrelationship. I believe we have a problem in design: we are great at adding new associations and metaphors to create desire in our new products, but have not worked out how to graphically or physically represent the non-mechanical ideas - the underlying parts that we need to see that build the foundations of descriptions for new products. Instead, we resort to buttons (icon and text) which usually are metaphors to earlier tools. This approach has divided our society between users of icon/text based interfaces and text- basedprogrammingthatbuildsthem.Codeisadescriptionofbehaviour;codedescribes a system and its potential possible actions.

But this does not make the most of people in our society. By not using the memorable and descriptive principals of the physical world, we take away the ability of those with the experience to create the new tools. It is the self-descriptive nature of well-designed tangible and graphical objects, combined with mans' ability to read their purpose that will open new opportunitiesforoursocietytounderstandandmanipulatethecomputationalsystemswe are building.

Concept: Anumberofphysical/tangibleelementsarepresentwithintheansweringmachine envisionment, each with corresponding computational associations and mediations: marbles: physical marbles acted as physical containers andembodiments of voice mes- sages.

The marble-\"expeller\" embodied a visual, auditory, and haptic indicator for the arrival of new messages. The marble holding area passively indicates how many messages have been received, while exposing each marble-message toward subsequent interaction. The machine's access touchpoint (visible in Figure 1.7a below the hand) provides a locus through which marble-messages can be retrieved. Finally, the recycle chute allows marble-messages to be returned for further use when no longer needed. ecologyofpassivesynergisticartifacts: Bishop'sanimationportraysanopen-endedsys- tem of passive artifacts which can be combined with marble-messages.

The envisionment illustrates marbles of several dierent colors, leaving open-ended whether these colors are random or purposely assigned; and the colors e-ink,etc.). Philosophy and cognition: Cognitive scientists have approached a growing consensus that the process of cognition lies not only in the human mind, but also within the physical world. Boththemarbles,andtheensembleofactivedevices(e.g.,answeringmachineandtelephone) and passive (dishes, racks) serve, from a cognitive science perspective, as external represen- tations.Theseare\"knowledgeandstructureintheenvironment,asphysicalsymbols,objects, or dimensions, and as external rules, constraints, or relations embedded in physical cong- urations\" [Zhang and Norman 1994]. \"External representations Consumer p ro duct industry engagement: vision of the future Closely related to Durrell Bishop's work and other explorations at schools and universities, industry has also long explored the potential and consequences of computational technology fordesignandoureverydayinteractionwiththeworld.ExamplesincludetheworkofInterval Research [Cohen et al. 1999a; Singer et 1999a; Withgott 2015a], ATG, Philips Corporate Design (PCD), and Oba Haruo's envisionments at Sony.

While articial lighting's mechanisms and pervasiveness have evolved since Edison's 1879 public demonstrations [Wikipedia 2017], the concept, for the most part, has not. Both technically and conceptually, \"I/O Bulbs\" elicited a deeper expectation: that every \"bulb\" serves jointly as input, output, and computational mediator.

Cubb y Aroundtheturnofthecentury,theFormTheorygroupatthedepartmentofIndustrialDesign Engineering at Delft University of Technology explored tangible interaction, from within a stream of cognition theory - the ecological theory of perception by Gibson [Gibson 1979a; Norman 1999]. In Gibson's view, we perceive the world as meaningful because of our bodily 't'withtheworld,andintermsofactionpossibilities[OverbeekeandHummels2013a].The FormTheorygroupexploredthepotentialofperception-actioncouplingsforHCI,andhowto bring technology into our embodied interactions in the world.

The consequences of ecological theories for design is compellingly illustrated when the user loses an object in \"space\" outside of the display, after dragging an object \"out\" of Cubby and releasing the grip of the hybrid tool.

We consider these now through havethusfarhighlighted,before laterrevisiting theseat greaterlength. Concept: Tangibleinterfaces,inthesebeginningsandcontinuingtothepresent,haveoften beenprofessionallymotivated.Thebuildingblockssystem,universalconstructor,andUrpall drew from the architecture domain, a domain rooted in the physical world and with a long tradition of engagement with physical models. Other systems, in early days and since, have frequently engaged other professional applications. Domestic contexts have also been active areas of academic and industry consideration, as illustrated both by the Marble Answering Machineitself,anditsvisionofabroaderecologyofinteractingproducts.Educationalcontexts in general, and work with younger children in particular, have also been among the most common tangibleinterfaceapplication drivers. Design:The physical and visual design of tangible interfaces sometimes engage relatively minimalistic,abstractforms;butalsoemploydiverseexpressive,representationalstyles(e.g., Urp'sRenaissance-themedwindtangibles).Tangiblessometimesarerealizedasindividualor sets of simple geometries such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders, often in modal sizes (e.g., cubes of 5cm or 10cm sides which likely draw from human hand anatomy and grasping postures). But equally often, representation is approached as models or miniatures of other systems (e.g., Urp's buildings); or as newly conceived and expressed forms (e.g., the marble answeringmachineandslotmachine).Thephysicalmediumsoftangiblessometimesemploy the plastics and prospectively mass-produced forms common among consumer electronics; but also wood, paper, cloth, and other more organic and (sometimes) evanescent materials, sometimes infashions explicitly aspiringto hand-crafting. Technology: The marble answering machine, slot machine, building blocks system, and universal constructor illustrate pursuit of computational and networking integration within appliances and products (e.g., the Internet of Things [Atzori et al. 2010; Gershenfeld et al. 2004]). Conversely, they can be regarded as progression of computational, communication, sensor,anddisplaytechnologiesintodiversephysicalcontexts(e.g.,ubiquitousandpervasive computing [Reilly et al. 2010; Weiser 1991a]). Some of these enabling technologies are embeddedwithinthetangiblesthemselves;somewithinproximalcomputersorcomputational devices (desktops, laptops, smart phones, etc.); and some within the physical environment (e.g.,walls,floors,andceilinglamps).Someoftheenablingcomputationanddataisproximal; others, prospectivelyin remote networkand cloudcontexts. Cognition: Tangibleinterfacesaresometimesorientedtowardindividualusers,butaremore often shaped by distributed cognition involving a plurality of people (sometimes copresent in space andtime, sometimesnot).

Reactable Concept: The Reactable system [Jord\u00e0 et al. 2007] aims to enhance interactive, collaborative and real-time electronic music production (see Figure 1.14). The system was designed and developed by a research team, originally from the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.

Thus, in order to design and buildanovelmusicalinstrument,thefullecosystemforatabletophardwareandsoftware framework needed to be created rst.

Technology: The Reactable uses the reacTIVison computer vision framework [Jord\u00e0 et al. 2007] to track nger touches and objects tagged with ducial markers. The visual feedback is displayed on the surface via a short-throw projector stored inside the table. reacTIVision is an open-source cross-platform computer-vision framework, which was designed for the construction of table-based tangible user interfaces. The framework provides a standalone applicationforfastandrobusttrackingofducialmarkersinareal-timevideostream,aswell as denes the communication protocol TUIO [Kaltenbrunner 2009a], which was specically designed for encoding and transmitting the attributes of tangible artifacts found on a table surface.

Siftables and Sifteo Cub es Concept: Mosttangibleinterfaceswehaveconsideredhavecenteredonphysicalartifactsthat are either physically passive (containing no active electronics), or limited in their display ca- pacity (as with the LED-embedded cubes of Frazer). In contrast, Siftables [Merrill 2009] (as an academic prototype) (see Figure 1.15a ) and Sifteo Cubes (as a commercial product) (see Figure1.15b) were faced with pixelated LCD displays. Cube sets could be bound to many dozensofavailableapplications,whichweretypicallydrivenbythecomposition,decomposi- tion,andrecompositionofCubes.Cubescouldidentifyneighboringcubes-bothhorizontally, and when stacked vertically; and could sense screen-touch and orientation. While most Cube applications were games [Geurts et al. 2014; Merrill photographs. Siftables explores how sensor network technologies can integrate com- ponentsofgraphicalandtangibleuserinterfaceswithoutrelyingonanexternalinfrastructure for delivering graphical output, which in turn increases the directness of users' interactions with digital media. Siftables is a collection of compact tiles (36mm x 36mm x 10mm), each tted with an LCD screen and various sensors. The small and compact form factor aords grasping and physical manipulation of the tiles. Each tile can sense its own motion and inter- actionswithothertiles,aswellasgesturessuchaslifting,tiltingandshaking.Visualfeedback is displayed on the embedded LCD screen in response to the user's physical manipulation of thecollection.SimilarlySifteoCubes,thecommercialproductbasedotheSiftablesresearch et al. 2007], Merrill describes three major design generations and an implemented hardware platform [Merrill 2009].

Sifteo provided an accessible API combined with distributed networked physical platform, which allowed researchers toexperimentwith awide range ofnovelconcepts. SMSlingshot Concept: The SMSlingshot (shown in Figure 1.16) is a project developed by VR/Urban, a collective of public media interventionists that aims to reclaim screens in public places [Fis- cher et al. 2013]. The project encourages interactions with large media fa\u00e7ades and the built environment, and simultaneously creates a digital space in which the public can \"speak up.\" SMSlingshot builds on humans' longtime desire to which is deployed in an urban environment.Itconsistsofawoodenslingshotembeddedwithakeyboardandamobiledevice.

Once the user has elected their target and released the ribbon, the message is sent to the computer and is displayed in a colorful splat on the wall, at the target point.

Behind the scenes, a camera detects the laser point on the fa\u00e7ade while a laptop runs the SMSlingshot software and the laser detection program. A radio modem receives the information from the slingshot and a projector displays the visuals on the wall. The 'in the wild'deploymentsoftheSMSlingshotpushedtheimplementationtowardsproduct-nearness, accomplishing therobustness required from theenvironment.

This is a prospect toward immediate realization of user-generated virtual content in arbitrary spatial contexts. TRANSF ORM Concept: CreatedbyProfessorHiroshiIshiiandMIT'sTangibleMediaGroup,TRANSFORM (shown in Figure 3.4) morphs static furniture into a dynamic machine driven by a stream of data and energy [Ishii et al. 2015a]. TRANSFORM embodies Ishii's vision of \"Radical Atoms\"[Ishii et al. view 2021-10-11 [Ishiietal. 2015a] reflects viewers' kinetic energy captured using sensors, which is represented on the table interfacethroughthemotionofdynamicpins.Theinterfacehaspotentialtobeaneectivetool forstorytellingandartisticexpressiongivenitsabilitytocommunicateideasviathepowerof dynamic computation and tangiblerepresentation. Design:TRANSFORM is a custom built table interface embedded with three inFORM shapedisplays[Follmeretal.2013a].EachinFORMdisplayhas1,152pins(24x16pins)that shift up and down in real-time to reshape the tabletop into a dynamic display. The inFORM engines are integrated into the table with the technology fully exposed, so that the pistons and wiring are visible. The motion of the interface was inspired by: dynamic interactions betweenwind,waterandsandinnature;Escher'srepresentationsofcontinualmotion;andthe ephemeralqualitiesofsandcastlesbuiltbythesea.TRANSFORMhasthreerepresentational modes: Wave, Machine and Escher.

Modules can be combined to make larger shape display surfaces. Integrated into the hardware are custom Arduinos that run a PID controller to sense the position of six connected pins. The pins are moved via motorized slide potentiometers. The slide potentiometers are mounted onto a custom printed control board. To allow dense arrangement of the pins, Push-Pull rods link each pin with an actuator. Six buses bridged to a USB allow the boards communicate with a PC, which runs the TRANSFORM application. The application is built in C++/OpenFrameworks, and can support 3D models and grayscale images, that are rendered as a depth image, and transferred to the shape display over a USBconnection.AMicrosoftKinectismounted4maboveTRANSFORMtodetectvisitors' gesturesand arrival atthe table.

Dynamic constraints builds on and expand frameworks of Token and Constraints and appearances dynamically. TRANSFORM's shape displays can be viewed as \"digital clay\" - malleable material that is synced with an underlying digital model, and couldbe directly manipulatedbyusers'hands. Rep rise Rounding out our tangible beginnings, we consider two additional perspectives for contem- plating computationally-mediatedtangibility. T angible pa radigms Bill Verplank served as an early leader in designing computational systems at Xerox [John- son et al. 1989] and IDEO, and an early creator of tangible interfaces at Interval Research [Cohen et al. 1999a; Singer et al. 1999a]. In his paper \"Interaction Design Sketchbook\" Ver- plank[2009]introduces aframeworkfordesigninginteractiveproductsandsystems,existing of 4 parts: sketching, interaction, design and paradigms. \"The design of human-computer in- teraction has been organized around competing beliefs and professional establishments. It is important to realize how insular each of these paradigms can be and to consider how to crossparadigms\" [Verplank2009].Verplankisinspiredbythe extensions conceptof McLuhan [1964], indicating that an interaction problem is presented by everything that comes between myenvironmentandtheperson.Forexample,electronicsareextensionsofoursenses(media) and clothing is an extension of our skin (fashion). Based on the concept of extensions, Ver- plank[2009]introducessixparadigms(summarizedintheleftcolumnofFigure 1.18),where computers are seenas thefollowingmetaphors: electronic how Verplank's paradigms intersect with the exemplar interfaces discussed in this chapter. For each interface we specify a principal paradigm(denotedindarkgray)aswellassecondaryparadigms(denotedinlightgray).Most of the exemplar interfaces can be seen serving as toolswhich seems to make absolute sense considering the emphasis on tangibility to be able to directly manipulate these interactive artefacts as tools, e.g., the marble and slot machines as toolsfor operating on marble and cardmedia; or the ReacTable as instrument/tool, operating upon and \"through\" its \"control\" and \"sound objects\" (as media); or Cubby as tool/environment to interact with and operate on virtual objects displayed in this mini Virtual Reality Cave; or the Air Trac Control as instrument/tool, to get a spatial and time-related augmented overview of the dierent paper flight strips representing the dierent flights; or the Philips Vision of the Future designs as dailyobjects/tools forinteractingwithourhomeandperformingourjob(as media)aswellas expressingourselves(as fashion).AmongVerplank'sparadigms,the\"media\"roleissuggested asprincipalforthreeexemplars(BBS/UniversalConstructor,Urp,andSifteo).Ineachofthese, tangibles serve interest\" But viewed through Verplank's lens, it is perhaps more interesting and evocative to regard it as avehicle, through which access to the otherwise inaccessible (remote fa\u00e7ades) can be navigated. Perhaps similarly, the TRANSFORM platform can clearly be regarded as a tool; but both through its animatronic vitality, and through its examples as an actuated medium of tangible telepresence, Verplank's lifeparadigm/metaphor seems more suggestive. The Wearable Motherboard, where computers are woven into fabric and apparel, strongly t the fashionparadigm. Medium and message Contemplatingthewidelydivergentmessaginganddynamicsofnewspaper,radio,andtelevi- sion during the 1960s, Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan posited \"the medium is the message\" [McLuhan 1964]. In the realm of tangibility, consider wood and fabric, metal and plastic, leather and glass, paper and pylons, pasta and bone, straw and stone. Each of these physical mediums brings its own world of 10,000 diverse variations; woven into human 1.18 Verplank [2009] discerns six computing paradigms, regarding computers as dierent metaphors, more specically, as media, tool, vehicle, fashion, brain or life. When classifying ourtangiblesexemplars,weseethatmostoftheartifactsconsiderthecomputertobeatool(the principal paradigm is denoted in dark gray), followed by the metaphor of media. Moreover, most artefacts are not specied by one paradigm/metaphor, but by multiple (the secondary paradigmsare denotedin lightgray) . critical the role of the physical medium, the interwoven computational and (often) electronic mediums are equallycentral. For screen-centric computational interfaces, transience is arguably one of the central modalities and messages, with one moment's occupant of virtual real estate swiftly yield- ing to the next. Conversely, persistence is a central consequence and distinction of tangibles' physicality (though this takes an altered stance in actuated systems such as TRANSFORM). Understandingandoptimizingthetradeosattendantwithpersistenceisamajorthemeofthis book. We would also note that several of our examples deeply integrate active electronics within tangibles(Sifteo,SMSlingshot)orwithinsomeelementofthesystem(SlotMachine,Universal Constructor,WearableMotherboard,TRANSFORM).NotedresearcherKenHinckley(whose 1994\"passiveprops\"wasperhapstheearliesttangibleinterfacepublishedwithintheflagship ACM CHI conference [Hinckley et al. hardware changes all the rules\" ([Hinckley and Sinclair, 1999]). This practice of bending the form and function of one of the most general-purpose of instruments to task, data, or person specicity - is one of the great prospects,promises,and potentialsof tangibleinterfaces.re 2021-10-11 and manyothers are stories ofthe comingpages.

Programming and Rob otics TEIsystemsforprogrammingandroboticshavebeenusedinformalandinformalsettingsfor more than four decades. In Chapter 1, we described one of the earliest tangible programming systems, the Slot Machine, which allowed young children to program the behavior of robotic \"turtles.\"Foranin-depthhistorical-technicalsurveyofcomputationally-enhancedtoolkitsfor children, we refer the reader to Blikstein's survey [Blikstein 2015], which examines design principles and provides a framework for the analysis and future design of these toolkits. In this section, we chose to highlight three TEI systems for programming and robotics that evolved from academic research projects into commercial products: the LilyPad Arduino [Education],LittleBits[littleBits],andKIBO[Roboticsc].Thesethreecommerciallyavailable open-source construction kit for e-textiles [Education], which was invented by Leah Buechley in 2006 during her Ph.D. work in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Leah created the LilyPad with the intention to broaden participation in computing and robotics by enabling less gender-biased projects through the integration of electronics and soft materials [Buechley et al. 2008b]. The commercial version of LilyPad [Education] was created through a collaboration with SparkFun Electronics and launched in 2007. The LilyPad Arduino kits (see Figure 2.1) combine sewable electronics with conductive materials (thread and fabric). Two years following its release, Bueckly and HillinvestigatedLilyPad'sadoption'inthewild'[BuechleyandHill2010].Theycollectedand analyzed sales records and online project documentation and found that LilyPad was widely adopted by a new community of developers that diered in demographics from traditional electricalengineeringandcomputersciencedevelopercommunities.Asignicantpercentage oftheparticipantsinthiscommunitywerewomen.TheprojectsbuiltbytheemergingLilyPad communitywerealsodierentfromtraditionalelectronicsandroboticsprojectsandincluded interactive clothing, soft toys, costumes, sculptures, and sport accessories.

The littleBits physical electronics toolkit [littleBits] (see Figure 2.2) was launched as an open platform project in 2008 by Ayah Bdeir, an engineer and interactive artist, with the goal of enhancing creativity with electronics by \"making prototyping with sophisticated electronics a matter of snapping small magnets together\" [Bdeir 2009b]. The toolkit was releasedin2011asacommercialproduct.LittleBitsconsistsofover70dierentcolor-coded blocks (pre-assembled circuit boards) that magnetically connect to each other by snapping together.The colorcodesindicate thecategoryoftheblock: input,output,power, andlogical operators. LittleBits' design is gender neutral and age agnostic. The bits are small and are easily combined with other materials such as paper, fabric, and cardboard. Most kits do not require a computer for programming the bits, however recent kits are accompanied by a dedicated mobile application. Educational materials are available for users and educators throughmobileapplicationsandonline.LittleBitswereevaluated'inthewild'withinvarious educational settings including schools, after-school programs, and workshops [Lin Shaer 2016]andwereshowntofacilitatecreativeengagementandlearningofcomputationalthinkingre view 2.2 Clockwise from top-left: Little Bits electronic toolkit; a robotic dog created by two kindergarteners; a cat project created by a third grader; and a bird project crafted by a fourth grader [Lin and Shaer 2016]. principles.

Biology Advances in life science technologies have transformed biological inquiry and have the po- tential to alter medicine to oer much-improved health care [Chin et al. 2011]. Biological technologies are also positioned to address pressing challenges, including food and clean wa- ter shortages, and increased demand for alternative energy sources [Carlson 2010]. Consid- ering the transformative impact of biology, it is important to inspire the next generation of scientistsandinnovatorstoexplorecutting-edgeareasoflifesciencesincludinggenomics,bi- ological engineering, and synthetic biology. However, creating interactive learning activities in biology is challenging due to the several factors including the complexity of the topic, the long-time scales of living cells and organisms, prescriptive experimental design, and the fact that the behaviors of biological systems often occur at the nanometer level [Okerlund et al. 2016]. Based on our own experiences working at the intersection of biology and TEI both as interaction designers [Shaer et al. 2010, 2011, 2012;Ullmer 2012c; Wu et al. 2011] and genomic investigators [Han et al. 2007; Locke et al. 2011; Sequencing et al. 2007], we argue thatTEIapproachesoeruniqueopportunitiesforenhancinglearningwithbiology.Here,we describe several projects, which make hands-on learning activities in biology accessible for K-12students.

DIYbio (Do It Yourself Biology) is an emerging movement [Kuznetsov et al. 2012] within the broader maker culture that seeks to enable designers and makers to experiment with biological protocols outside of traditional wet laboratory settings.

The system consists of a lab in a box with a novel disposable fluidic vessel, where experiments are conducted in a bag. MFB is aordable, safe, and sterile and supports temperature control, liquid circulation, measurement of optical density, and a web interface for remote control and monitoring. A dierent project - bioMAKERlab, is a wet laboratory starter kit for synthetic biology activities in high school classrooms, which was developed by Yasmin Kafai and her team at theUniversityofPennsylvania[Kafaietal.2017].Thisbio-fabricationtoolsupportsmicrobial genetic modication and fabrication, providing students with a model for connecting biology with othermaking activities. In Chapter 6, we expand the discussion on the intersection between TEI and biology by discussing TEI approaches, which provide new ways for enhancing exploration of biological data, andfor designingwith biologicalmaterials. Cultural Heritage Cultural heritage refers to the legacy of physical artifacts as well as intangible cultural tradi- tions, expressions, and values, that are passed across generations [Ciol and Petrelli 2015].

People with cognitive impair- ments, such as dementia, can experience challenges in understanding what it means to share information online as well as how to use traditional desktop or mobile interfaces. Over the last four years, we have conducted research within a memory care center for older adults. The majority of the adults we interacted with have dementia (e.g., from Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia from stroke) that aects their memory, speech and language, and physical abilities (e.g., limited arm/hand mobility, use a wheelchair). Our work has focused on how these older adults' create, share, and connect through art- work created within an art therapy program.

This chapter examines the evolving concept of tangible and embodied interaction (TEI). Research eorts focusing on post-WIMP (Windows Icons Menus Pointing) interactions have developed in parallel in several institutions, resulting in the emergence of interaction styles and research areas that share a common vision with TEI - richer forms of human- computer interaction thatinterlink thephysical anddigitalworlds. For example, the vision of ubiquitous computing - profound interconnected technologies thatdisappearby\"weavingthemselvesintothefabricofeverydaylife\",introducedby Weiser [1991b] at Xerox PARC in 1991, has inspired numerous researchers and practitioners. In a 2004papertitled\"Bottles:ATransparentInterfaceasaTributetoMarkWeiser\",HiroshiIshii addressed a misinterpretation of the concept of ubiquitous computing, which focused on begin this chapter by surveying these research areas and their shared aspirations. We alsoconsidertheoreticalframeworksthatviewTEIaspartofanemerginggenerationofHCI, or ofa larger interaction paradigm. Finally,wehighlighttaxonomiesandframeworksthatforwardtheunderstandingofTEIby examining their properties, and provide conceptual power for analyzing and comparing TUI instances as well as generating ideas for new TEI systems. We conclude by discussing new directions that push the boundaries of TEI towards new paradigms and suggesting new areas for research. 95re view 2021-10-11 not for Computing Mark Weiser, then the director of the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at Xerox PARC, articulatedhisvisionofubiquitouscomputingintheseminalpaper\"TheComputerforthe21st Century\" [Weiser 1991b], envisioned a fu- ture where interconnected computational devices are integrated seamlessly into our everyday environment and play a prominent role in supporting daily work and leisure activities. Seam- less integration also means that computing as a technology disappears into the background, allowing peopleto focus on theirtasks andactivities ratherthan onoperatingtheir devices. Inparticular,Weiserdescribeshowmultiplecomputationaldevicesofdierentsizescould be embedded in everyday artifacts and activities; for example, the foot-scale pad and the yard-scale board described by Weiser could support both individual and collaborative work, equivalenttotoday'stabletsandlarge-scaledisplays.Theinch-scaletabsdescribedinthepaper support a variety of tasks such as displaying state information as well as tracking location, activity, and objects. These devices are comparable to the Sifteo Blocks, which we described in Chapter1, andto today'ssmartbuttons, activitytrackers,and watches. Ubiquitous computing also involves mobility of both people and devices. Instead of only interacting with computers in a xed location, people are capable of interacting with devices while inmotion. Computingis pervasive,and somedevices couldbe usedeverywhere. Today, research in this area includes the design, implementation, and deployment of ubiq- uitous and pervasive computing technologies, as well as the study of human experiences and social impacts facilitated by these technologies [ubi 2017]. Also related to ubiquitous com- puting is the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) [of Things Consortium] - a network of connected devices with services for a wide range of applications domains including smart homes,automotives,andcities.NumerouscompaniesareprovidingIoTbusinesssolutionsfor avarietyofindustriesrangingfromretail,tohealthcare,tomanufacturing,towildlifemanage- ment.

However, rather than integrating computing devices and electronics in physical objects, AR focuses on presenting virtual objects or digital information alongside physical objects in the real world [Milgram and Kishino 1994]; the information can be pro- jected uponsurfacesor objectsor displayed ona handheldor head-worndisplay. Tangible Augmented Reality (Tangible AR) interfaces [Kato et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2004; White et al. 2009] are approaches which consistently with the early denition of computer- augmented environment [Wellner et al. 1993], combine tangible input with AR involved using computer vision to track visual markers and presenting the visualization on a display so that the imagery is shown at the same location and 3D orienta- tion as the visual marker. Examples of this approach include augmented paper strips for air trac control [Vinot et al. 2014], parallel web browsing [AlSada and Nakajima 2015], books [Billinghurst et al. 2001], entertainment work environments [Gervais etal. 2016; Rekimoto andSaitoh1999]. Advances in displays, spatial audio delivery, and tracking technologies (e.g. the Hololens [Microsoft] and MagicLeap [MagicLeap] devices) allow for blending digital content into the physicalenvironmentinnewways.However,virtualobjectsareeasilydistinguishedfromtheir physicalcounterpartsupontouchduetothelackofhapticfeedback[VallinoandBrown1999]. Recent work in the area explores how to reduce this visual-haptic mismatch by scanning and selecting physical objects from the real environment that are similar to the virtual objects. Digital imageries could be overlaid on the selected physical objects to provide natural haptic feedbackthatmatchesthe form ofthevirtual object[Hettiarachchi andWigdor2016]. Current research in this area focuses on improving user tracking, surface scanning, and display technology, as well as on enriching user experiences of interacting with tangible AR and mixedAR environments.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution98Chapter 3Framing TEI Interactive Surfaces and Spaces Researchoninteractivesurfacesandspacesfocusesoninteractiontechniquesandtechnologies for tracking user actions and objects upon a surface or within an interactive space. This area is inspired by andrelates to bothubiquitouscomputingand AR. Many tangible interfaces use interactive surfaces, often tabletops, with a tracking mech- anism as the basis of interaction. For example, consider the Reactable system [Jord\u00e0 et al. 2007b], which was introduced in Chapter 1. This system for digital music performers com- bines bothtangible andmulti-touch inputupon aninteractive tabletop. Research within the area of interactive surfaces and spaces increasingly studies the use of mixed input technologies. Examples include integrating multi-touch and tangible input [Kirk et al. 2009]; utilizing active tokens with interactive surfaces [Valdes et al. 2014]; combining gaze and touch [Pfeuer and Gellersen 2016]; and enhancing interaction with touch input small skin-tap gestures[Zhang et al. 2015b], which we dis- cussed in Chapter 1, is a dynamic tangible display that transforms kinesthetically in response tothepresenceofphysicalobjects,changesindata,andusers'movements.Recenteortsalso investigatethefeasibilityofinteractivesurfacesconstructedwithnovelmaterialsrangingfrom water condensation [Tsujimoto et al. 2016], to textiles [Poupyrev et al. 2016], to food [Zhang et al.2016]. Ambient Displa ys As part of the ubiquitous computing vision, Weiser and his team at Xerox PARC have de- veloped the concept of Calm Technology [Weiser and Brown 1996b]. Calm technology was described as engaging both the center and the periphery of our attention while moving back and forthbetweenthe two. Natalie Jeremijenko, then an artist-in-residence at Xerox PARC, designed an enchanting instrument for visualizing network trac that demonstrates this concept. The LiveWire, or \"DanglingString\"[WeiserandBrown1996b],wasaneight-foot(2.4m)stringconnectedtoa smallelectricmotormountedtheceiling.ThemotorwasattachedtoanEthernetcable.When the network was quiet the string twitched every few seconds; when the network was busy the string whirled wildly and produced a noise. The instrument was placed in a side corner of a workspace so that it is visible and audible from many oces, communicating information by taking advantage ofperipheralcues. Synergistically with the development of the concept of calm technology, Ishii and Ulmer includedtheuseofambientmediaforcommunicatinginformationintheirTangibleBitsvision [Ishii and Ullmer 1997b]. In particular, they described the use of media such as sound, light, airflow,and water movementintheperipheryof humanperception.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution3.2 U nifying Frameworksfor Post-WIMP Interactions 99 However, the concept of ambient displays soon developed into a research area of its own. Most ambient displays utilize purely graphical representations on screens of various scales, though multiple projects employ tangible interfaces as ambient displays. For example, Edge andBlackwell [2009]presentedaninterfaceconsistingoftangibleobjectsplacedonasurface next to an oce worker's workspace; this interface drifts between focus and periphery of a user's attention. The tangibles represent tasks and documents to support personal and group task management and coordination.

Both frameworks can also guide us in creating new de- signsbyencouragingdesignerstoconsidertheirchoicesagainstasetofprinciples,properties, and trade-os. Instrumental Interaction Instrumental Interaction is an interaction model [Beaudouin-Lafon 2000] that extends the principles of direct manipulation to apply to post-WIMP interactions. The model is based on the observation that people naturally use tools (or instruments) to manipulate objects in the physical world. The model stresses that \"our interaction with the physical world is governed by our use of tools,\" and thereby denes direct manipulation of objects as a process that occurs when people bring objects of interest into a particular context and manipulate them with suitableinstruments. Suchmanipulation often involvestwo hands[Guiard1987]. The model distinguishes between domain objects - objects of interest and the purpose of user interactions with a given application, and interaction instruments - artifacts that a user operates to manipulate domain objects. Users act upon an instrument, which transforms user actionsintocommandsaectingtheattributesofrelevanttargetdomainobjects,andprovides feedbackasthecommandiscarriedoutontargetobjects.Themodelalsonotesthataninterface provides a potentially large number of instruments, but users might only be able to operate a small number of instruments at a time due to spatial or temporal constraints.

Realit y-Based Interaction The term Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) was proposed by Jacob et al. [2008] as a unifying framework that encompasses a large subset of emerging interaction styles including virtual reality, augmented reality, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and tangible interaction. The framework views these emerging interaction styles as a new generation of human-computer interaction, referred to as reality-based interaction. This notion results from the observation that many of these interaction styles take advantage of users' experience and well-entrenched skills and allow interaction with the real non-digital world to a greater extent than traditional graphical user interfaces. These approaches oer fluid and free-form interactive experiences that are more similar to interactions with the real world, rather than being isolated from the non-digital environment. The framework highlights four themes of interaction with the real world, which emerging interactionstyles typically drawupon (seeFigure 3.1): Naive Physics - the common-sense knowledge that people have about the real physical world. Body Awareness and Skills - people's awareness of their own physical bodies, and their skills of controlling and coordinatingtheir bodies. Environment Awareness and Skills - people's sense of surroundings and their skills of navigating, manipulating, and altering their environment. Social Awareness and Skills - the awareness people have of others and their skills of interacting and cooperatingwith otherpeople. These four themes play a prominent role in the design of emerging interaction styles and provide a basis of human-computer interaction that is closer to interaction with the real, non-re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution3.2 U nifying Frameworksfor Post-WIMP Interactions 101 Figure 3.1 Jacobetal.

By oering multiple input devices, so that input and output are distributed over space, graspable user interfaces allow for simultaneous, independent, and potentially persistent selection of objects. Therefore, space-multiplexing allows for concurrent access and manipulation with two hands or by multiple users. Specic input devices - the use of input or output devices with rich aordances that are dedicated to a specicfunctionality andpotentiallyembody thatfunctionality. Spatial awareness and recongurability - the use of physical input devices is inherently spatial. Input devices can be arranged and rearranged spatially in a way that is also physically persistent. This allows users to leverage spatial awareness and reasoning as well as musclememory. By describing these properties, Fitzmaurice et al. provided an early denition of a novel design space, and helped to highlightopportunitiesforfurtherresearch.

In this interface, multiple cards could be stacked upon one another to create composite commands. For example, a number cardcouldbestackeduponanactioncardtoindicatemoveforwardacertainnumberofsteps.

Their Token+Constraint approach combines tokens and constraints, two kinds of physical/digital objects.Tokensrepresentdigitalinformation,whileconstraintsprovidestructure(e.g.stacks, slots, racks), which guides users how to (and how not to) manipulate and compose tokens ontovariouscomputationalinterpretations.Figure 3.3illustratescongurationsoftokensand constraints.ThisapproachhasbeenappliedmostlyinthedesignofTUIswithabstractdigital information that has no inherent tangible representation or physical manipulation syntax.

More specically, they describe the invisibility dilemma - hid- ing computational augmentation yet at the same time communicating to users which objects are augmented. The framework also highlights the notions of explicit vs. implicit interaction, where explicit interactions means that the user operates a system knowingly and implicit in- teractions are caused by the user engaging in a daily activity that involves augmented objects and spaces(e.g. entering aroom,using apen). The framework of embedded interaction provides design and technical considerations for researchersandpractitionerswhodevelopnewsystems.Theconceptualnotionofembedding interaction into users' everyday tasks and context is further examined and discussed through the perspectiveof EmbodiedInterfaces. Emb o died Interfaces The rise of embedded interaction, which augments everyday artifacts and the physical envi- ronment with computing, created a need for considering new human computer interactions - ones that are situated in social, cultural, and physical contexts. In his 2001 book, \"Where the Action Is \u2014 The foundations of Embodied Interaction\" [Dourish 2001a], Dourish used the term embodied interaction as \"interaction with computer systems that occupy our world, a worldof physical andsocial reality, andthat exploitthis Yvonne Rogers, University College London Tangibility and Embodiment: Moving Beyond Grasping a) A pair of children using our tangible toolkit Magic Cubes - to learn about coding, IoT and electronics. b) The physical-digital sh pond at Great Ormond Street Hospital. c) Answering questions using physical sliders when interacting with VoxBox.

Since their inception, the concepts of tangibility and embodiment have been extended in a variety of ways leading to new design possibilities. This suggests that in the future we begin framingthemmoreasdesignprinciples,ratherthanaspropertiesperse,thatcaninform creativity in design. Below, I describe three examples of how we have been inspired to think dierently; fromobjects tosurfacestosurveys. 1.Physical-digital objects can be held in our hands and manipulated in various ways. Cubes, spheres, toys, rods, balls, bricks, phones and other customized artefacts can be interacted with, by themselves, or with other surfaces, causing digital content to appear and move on, around and nearby - be it shadows, shapes, graphs, creatures, plants and the like. This way of engaging with technology can appear to be quite magical;encouragingindividualstoexplore,discoverandwanttolearnmoreabout dierentcause-eects.Theycanalsotriggersocialinteractions,suchasspontaneous collaboration. For example, we have found in our research that children often want to show and tell others about their achievements when using one of our tangible toolkits [Johnson et al.2016]. 2.Physical-digital surfaces can elicit a variety of embodied interactions. We can use our bodies to make digital content stir, through moving around on floor displays and in front of wall displays. An example is an animated digital sh pond that is projected on the floor of the reception area at Great Ormond Street Hospital in the UK. It is programmed to move virtual sh around in response to someone standing on it by changing their direction as if moving away from the person.

For example, we developed VoxBox as an innovative method for gathering opinions and gauging the mood of communities or crowds at events [Golsteijn et al. 2015]. Responses were made physically by touching it rather than lling out a form on paper or a website. In particular, people answer questionsbyusingarangeofsliders,dialsandknobs.Aswellasgatheringopinions, VoxBox allows people to see how their views compare to those of other people, by looking at digital visualisations that appear in realtime. It was also designed to be colourful, physical and playful in appearance, in order to grab people's attention and invite them to come and touch it. We have found that in many contexts, this kindoftouchableinterfacehasbeenhighlysuccessfulatencouragingadiversityof people to participate to give their opinions.

These perspectives on embodied interaction are strongly influenced by ideas from philos- ophy and cognition.

In the next chapter, we review theses theoretical foundations in depth and discuss their implicationsfor thedesign ofTEI systems. Since tangible user interfaces seek to 'give physical form to digital information' thereby making computing part of the everyday physical world, the concepts of tangible and embod- ied interactions are highly interrelated, and can be viewed as complementary.

This starts with how much you need to read to fully understand. And when have you understood well enough? Applying theory in design then is top-down, which can result in great principled designs, but also stifles creativity. The common approach of distilling design guidelines from theorydoes notreallyresolve this. WhendevelopingmyTEIframework,discussionswithdesignersanddesigneducators unearthed another concern: For designers, guidelines are there to be understood and then to be broken with intent, not to be used as a checklist. Many designers just dislike them.Moreover,guidelinesandchecklistcanresultinthoughtlessadherence,theydonot guarantee good design. Thus, instead of guidelines, the TEI framework has sensitizing questionsatitslowest,concretelevel.Wefeltthistobeparticularlyappropriatesincenot everyaspectoftheframeworkwouldbeimportantforanygivenapplicationorsettingto design for.

This approach resonates and elaborates the discussion of a CHI 2012 panel titled \"Material Interactions - From Atoms and Bits to Entangled Practices\",whereparticipantshighlighted\"amoveawayfromaperspectivethattreatspeople and computers as two separate and distinct entities toward a perspective that acknowledges how people, computational materials, and even traditionally non-computational materials are coming together asa whole[Wiberg et al.2012].\" ThisisanexcitingtimeforconsideringthematerialityofTEI.ThematerialsTEIisplaying with is changing - the physical and dynamic qualities of materials are getting less rigid and mechanical.

Several recent projects have begun to examine such connections from a TEI perspective: Stoel Kuenen [Kuenen 2015] presented the notion of aesthetics of being together in his PhD thesis, where he explored how the presence of others is expressed in the presence of an artifact (and vice versa). For example, his group-mediating system Sliders consists of a numberofnetworkedlinearactuators(motorfaders)thatenableagroupofpeopletofeeleach other remotely [Kuenen 2015]. Bogers et al.

WhiletheseexamplesshowsomeofthepossibilitiesofTEIapproachesformesoandmacro scale interactions, the full potential of TEI on a meso and macro scale is still in its infancy and requires extensive research. The potential roles of dierent modalities for large group interactions, such as audio, touch, and smell, are still underexposed. When talking about the meso and macro level, one touches immediately upon scalability. The level of scalability of TEI is generally limited in comparison the digital world. These larger scales of interaction and the need to \"design tangible systems with simplied scalability\" [Wallbaum et al. 2017], present opportunities for new TEI paradigms that go beyond the micro level of individual or small group interaction to explore TEIat thecommunity andsocietal levels. Summa ry As the area of TEI has evolved, researchers have proposed numerous frameworks and tax- onomies that provide dierent perspectives on the design space. Most frameworks provide researchers with explanatory power, enabling them to reason about, classify, analyze, and compare interfaces. Some frameworks provide generative capacity as well, highlighting open opportunities in the design space and informing the designofnewinterfaces.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution122Chapter 3Framing TEI Figure 3.14 Hydroscope:thisPeepholeexperienceallowsuserstolookdownintothedigitaloceanthrough the hydroscope, and through pushing the hydroscope around thefloortorevealmoreoftheocean(photocourtesyChristianDindler).[Dindleretal.2007] Mazalek and Hoven proposed to map the framework space for TEI to help designers iden- tify which frameworks could guide them based on their needs [Mazalek and Van den hoven 2009].Theycreatedatwo-dimensionalframeworkmapwheretheverticalaxisrepresentsthe facet of tangible interaction addressed by the framework - technologies, interactions, physi- cality, domains, and experiences- and the horizontal axis represents the type of frameworks - abstracting,designing,andbuilding.Withinthisspace,frameworksaredenotedinatype/facet areausingboxes.Astherearenumerousframeworksthatwecouldnotincludeinthischapter, we encourage the reader to revisit Mazalek and Hoven's original frame work map [Mazalek and Van den hoven 2009].

In this chapter we delve into the cognitionfacetthatinfluencedandinformedtheconceptoftangibleandembodiedinteraction. In particular, we focus on the notions of cognition that recognize that we are physical beings, andthatourexistenceisgroundedinthephysicalworldandisprocessedthroughoursensory andmotorinteractionswiththespacearoundusandwiththethingsandpeoplethatexistwithin it. Althoughthismayseemobviousandrelatestolongstandingideasthatareatthecoreofthe philosophical movement of phenomenology [Moran 2000], broad shift from a centralist (brain-centric) view of cognition to what Killeen call an \"exocentric paradigm\"representsa\"seachange\"thatisstillrollingoutinthecognitivesciences[Hostetter and Alibali 2008]. We draw on this evolving view here, understanding cognition as a process that happens not in the brain alone (with perceptual and motor systems acting as mere inputs andoutputsforthoughtshappeninginthehead),butratherasaprocessthatengagesthebrain, the body, and the physical and social environment together. This paradigm is supported by a wide array of empirical evidence as well as diering but related research approaches that have been characterized broadly by terms like detail inthis chapter. Intro duction We opened Chapter 1 by noting the transformative power of the digital medium, which now seems to touch nearly every aspect of human engagement.

Just as the cognitive sciences are navigating a \"sea change\" to a more embodied view of cognition, so too is the eld of HCI shifting from predominantly screen-based forms to more tangible and embodied experiences of digital information. And as these two shifts operateinparallel,HCIresearchersanddesignerscanandmustlooktoembodiedcognitionas a framework for digital, tangible and embodied interaction design. Per Kirsh [2013], \"HCI is at a crossroads. We are entering a new world of physical, natural, and tangible interfaces.

Discovery and Lea rning First designed and built in the early 18th century, the Orrery mentioned in Chapter 1 is a me- chanicaldevicethatbothcalculatesandrepresentsthepassageofplanets(seeFigure 4.1,left). In his book Thing Knowledge [2004], Baird discusses the Orrery at some length, explaining how it embodies knowledge through its material relations, both geometric and causal. These material relations produce a demonstration, powering the model's ability to explain and pre- dict.Bairdalsodiscussesanotherprominentexample,thedoublehelixmodelofDNAbuiltby Watson and Crick (see Figure 4.1, right).

The tactile manipulation, which can be structural but might also be chemical, thermal, electrical, or other, is especially critical in cases where conceptual manipulations may be too dicult due to analytical complexity or lack of theory. As Baird writes about James Ferguson's 1744 Orrery and Watson and Crick's DNA model, \"Ferguson wasabletondthemoon'sorbit[aroundthesun]withhismaterialmodelwhenananalyticalre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution4.2 Thinking with Things 125 Figure 4.1 Illustrationof woodenpulleyOrrery byJamesFerguson,c.1755(left).Theorrerywasused to illustrate the motions of the Moon and Earth around the Sun.

Through physical manipulations, users can thus build up an understanding of the behavior of the systemthey aremodeling. Baird also describes other ways that artifacts, specically scientic instruments, embody knowledge. He calls these \"working knowledge\" and \"encapsulated knowledge.\" Working knowledge describes the way certain artifacts constitute knowledge by creating phenomena, for example the devices Michael Faraday built in 1821 to produce electromagnetic rotation. Encapsulated knowledge describes how certain artifacts like those used for measurement combine both model knowledge (since a model must be built into the artifact) and working knowledge (as the artifact itself has to present a phenomenon given the appropriate inputs orre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution126Chapter 4Theories ofEmbodiment Figure 4.2 Active Pathways [Mehta et al. 2016a] uses active tangibles on a tabletop surface to model biochemical reaction networks and test the built models against experimental datasets (left).

Clearly, the motor system, with actions guided by a physical artifact, is heavilyinvolvedin theircognitiveperformance. Ourunderstandingofthewaychildrenlearnalsoshowstheimportanceofinteractionwith physical artifacts and materials. Martin and Schwartz [2005] have investigated how actions impact thinking and learning, suggesting that the way in which this happens depends both on how stable the child's ideas are and how stable the environment they are working within is. Having stable ideas and working within a stable environment allows the learner to o- load their thinking into the environment. When the learner's ideas are not stable, a stable environment that oers strong constraints and clear feedback can guide interpretation. When the learner's ideas are stable but their environment is adaptable, this can leave room for the learner to develop their own problem-solving strategies. And lastly, if both their ideas and the environment are adaptable, a learner may interact with the environment without knowing exactly what steps to take or even what they want to achieve. In studying how children learn fractionswithdierentmaterials,MartinandSchwartz[2005]foundthatabenetofphysical actions for learning abstract ideas is that it allows new interpretations to emerge throughre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution4.2 Thinking with Things 127 physical adaptations to the environment.

In the TEI context, researchers have integrated these approaches with computation, for example as we discussed in Chapter 2, to introduce children to programming concepts through physical manipulation of interlocking blocks that represent actions for a robot to perform [Horn and Jacob 2007a](see Figure 4.2, right).

Second, taking a pragmatic approach to epistemology, we analyzed multiple theories of cognition and learning and extracted explicit mechanisms that we thought lend themselves to being augmented by the unique features of tangibles. Based on this analysis, we derived actionable guidelines, where evidence existed, stated at a level of specicity that allowed designers to use them not simply as a justication for why TUIs should be used in learning but to inform specic design choices. Lastly, by laying out the connections between TUI design choices and cognitive and learning theories, we proposed testable explanations about how and why TUIdesignwasexpectedtoimpactlearningandraisedresearchquestionswhereguidance was lacking.

Second, we used the theory of positive interdependence in collaborative learning, to explicitly design a tangible tabletop called Youtopia [Antle et al. 2013b]. Youtopia is a collaborative land-use planning system that enabled us to explore how to design to collaborative learning that contained instances of rich negotiation and reflection. We designed Youtopia following our own guidance to distribute tangible controls across social roles (land use developer or resource manager) using codependent access points (creating land-uses required sequences of actions with physical tools which distributed across roles).

Renowned architect Frank Gehry, for example, uses explorative model-making extensively throughout his design process , and it is only in the later stages of his design process that his practice turns to computers [Dunn2007]. Assembling and repurposing materials is also an important part of the tradition of craft and DIY (do-it-yourself) creative practices. People engage in craft and DIY activities for many dierent reasons, such as the desire to customize things they own, the desire to learn new things, or simply a personal creative drive. Over the past decades, emerging interaction technologieshaveextendedDIYdesignandmakingpracticestoincludedigitalandelectronic materials, often in combination with physical materials such as textiles, wood, paper and paint. A variety of toolkits have to support these activities, and some of these have been picked up and even fueled by the HCI and TEI community.

The Lukasa (see Figure 4.4, left) of the Luba peoples of central Africa, mentioned in Chapter 1, provides a striking example of how beautifully crafted artifacts can capture both shared and personal histories through tangible and spatially encoded elements (such as beads and carvings) that represent place, genealogy, political relations and more, in a way that is not static but rather open to interpretation. Roberts and Roberts [1996a] call the performance with a Lukasa a \"generative reconstruction of the past\" (p.118); as the performer's hands run across the surface of the Lukasa, the artifact serves as a kind of performative mnemonic, triggering memory during the act of storytelling. And this storytellingperformance,withtheLukasaaswellaswithotherLubaartifactssuchasbeaded necklaces, headdresses, stas, spears and scepters, is an inherently social process, bringing communitymemberstogetherintheco-constructionofmemory.AsRobertsandRobertswrite, \"Mnemonicdeviceselicitvisual,verbal,andperformativearts,andLubaobjectswereandare read,spoken,sung,danced,andmanipulated.\"(p.44).Inrecentwork,theconceptoftheLukasa was re-created as a tangible tabletop installation piece (see Figure 4.4, right) that was shown as part of the Mapping Place exhibit at the Robert C.

As the storyteller weaves their tale, they open and close the panels, and point to the images of Gods, goddesses, saints, local heroes and others that are depicted on them. In this way, the shrines serve as a memory aid for the storytellers and listeners alike, keeping the family and community's storiesaliveacrossgenerations. In the TEI context, there is a growing body of work on tangible narratives [Harley et al. 2016a], which explores how digital narratives can be experienced through digitally enhanced physical artifacts.

Tangible Spatial Narratives (middle) used physical pawns on an interactive tabletop to explore multi-threaded and stories in a non-linear way by snapping together triangular shaped tiles with illustra- tions depicting characters, settings, events and dialogue (see Figure 4.6, left). Other tangible narrativesystemshaveusedinteractionwithphysicalartifactsoninteractivetabletopsurfaces, such as Tangible Viewpoints [Mazalek et al. 2002] and Tangible Spatial Narratives [Maza- lek and Davenport 2003], where the manipulation of physical pawns on a tabletop surface allowed users to experience multi-viewpoint and spatially structured stories (see Figure 4.6, middle). In all of these examples, the physical manipulation and re-conguration of physical artifacts served as a means for users to interactively navigate and make sense of a complex narrative space. Digitally-enhanced tangible artifacts have also been used to support human remembering by connecting to people's own memories and personal histories. For example, Cueb and 4Photos [van den Hoven 2014] both combine physical designs with computing to facilitate communication about the past through the use of material and digital memory cues (see Figure 4.6,right).

We can look to board games as tangible mediators of game play and social activity. Archeological evidence such as tomb paintings and literary texts give us clues about the role that board games have played in society for over 3,000 years. For example, the game of Senet (see Figure 4.7) was popular among pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. Depictions typicallyshowapairofplayerssittingonoppositesidesoftheSenetboard,withthegameplay sometimes shown in the context of funeral celebrations, alongside scenes of people engaged in the game state, as well as controls for moving the game forward. A typical gameplay convention, seen for example in the game of chess, is that a player's move remains open until they have released their piece. In this way, the physical pieces also serve as a cognitive aid, allowing players to better imagine potential outcomes by physically testing out their moves beforecommitting tothem. In the TEI context, multi-touch and tangible tabletop platforms oer the opportunity to bring together the advantages of traditional board games, such as using physical pieces to represent and control game state and face-to-face social interaction, with the advantages of computer games, such as rich multimedia content and more complex computationally-driven game mechanics.

Theo retical F oundations In the previous section, we looked at examples of how we think, play and connect with each other through bodily engagement with, and material manipulation of, physical artifacts across dierent parts of our lived experience. We now turn to the theoretical foundations for the area of TEI. In particular, TEI reflects and draws on ideas that have been explored in philosophy, psychology and the cognitive sciences. These ideas are rooted in a rejection of the Cartesian separation between mind and body, also known as mind/body dualism, which is named after 17th century French philosopher Rene Descartes (1596-1650). In mind/body dualism, thinking is a process that happens in the brain, which maintains and works with an abstract representation of the world, and is separate from the inputs and outputs of the perceptual and motor systems. Mind/body dualism has been critiqued within dierent elds and these critiques have fol- loweddierentpathsthroughhistory.Onesuchpathisrootedinthephilosophicalmovement knownasphenomenologyandcanbetracedintothesocialsciences.Wecanfollowaparallel path in psychology and the cognitive sciences that is rooted in early motor theories of cogni- tion. The next sections are not intended as a comprehensive history of these trajectories, but rather aim to serve as a brief survey that will set the stage for a discussion of how these ideas havebeen picked upby HCI and TEI in section 4.4. Phenomenology Phenomenology is the branch of philosophy focused on the study of human experience that was founded by German philosopher Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) in the early 20th century. The mind/body dualism of Descartes was rooted in a representative theory of perception, whichholdsthatwearenotdirectlyawareofobjectsintheworldbutratherofrepresentationsre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution136Chapter 4Theories ofEmbodiment of objects in our minds. Husserl rejected this theory in favor of a view of consciousness as intentionalanddirectedatthingsintheworld.Inhislaterwork[Husserl1936],heintroduced the concept of \"life-world\" (lebenswelt), which represents the everyday world of human experience, both personal and intersubjective. Life-world is the dynamic and ever-changing social, cultural and historical background that we live in and from which our theoretical and scientic understandingof theworldoriginates. Phenomenologicalideaswerefurtherdevelopedbyotherphilosophersinthe20thcentury, including Husserl's student Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), as well as Austrian philosopher Alfred Schutz (1899-1959) and French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961). At the core of Heidegger's contribution to phenomenological thinking, elaborated in Being and Time[1927], was the concept of \"being-in-the-world,\" or \"Dasein,\" which emphasizes a way of knowing that is derived from our practical existence in the world, grounded in purposeful action. A characteristic of being-in-the-world is the state of \"thrownness\" (Geworfenheit), which captures the nature of human existence, where we are thrown into an already existing world and must act within it without a clear sense of what all the eects of our actions will be. Related to this, Heidegger distinguished between dierent ways of encountering things in the world and acting with them. Objects in the world are \"ready-to-hand\" (zuhanden) when we act through them, when they seem to disappear in the course of our actions with them. In contrast, objects in the world are \"present-at-hand\" (vorhanden) when we become conscious of them,when we attendto themand reflect onthem. In contrast to Husserl and Heidegger who both concentrated on individual experience, AlfredSchutzrelatedphenomenologicalthinkingtothesocialworldandtothesocialsciences. Hearguedthatourexperienceoftheworldincludesoursocialinteractionsandunderstandings, andwasthusconcernedwithhowpeoplecanbuildsharedmeaningfromtheirownexperiences of the world [Schutz 1932]. Merleau-Ponty also built on Husserl and Heidegger's ideas, focusing on the role of the body in perception. For Merleau-Ponty, a sense of the body and bodilyexperience givesmeaning to ourperceptionof theworld[Merleau-Ponty 1945b]. At the same time as these and other philosophers were formulating the core ideas of phe- nomenology, scientists and scholars in areas such as neuroscience, psychology cognition emergedin the mid-19thcentury and continued to develop into the early part of the 20th century [Scheerer 1984; Stock and Stock 2004].

On the British side, physician and neurophysiologist Thomas Laycock (1812-1876)observedthatreflex-likeactionsinpatientscouldbetriggeredbytheimagination alone, and tried to come up with a physiological explanation for this [Laycock 1845]. He also speculated that there are bidirectional connections between sensations and movements. His colleague, physician and physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter (1813-1885), coined the term \"ideo-motor\", i.e. the triggering of actions by ideas. Carpenter dierentiated ideo- motorreflexesfromexcito-motorandsensory-motorreflexes,andusedtheideaofideo-motor reflexestoproposeascienticexplanationforparanormalphenomena,likethemovementsof diviningrods[Carpenter1852].OntheGermanside,scientistslookedatmotorcognitionmore broadly to explain voluntary human behavior, and developed ideo-motor theory as a reaction against Cartesian mind/body dualism [Stock and Stock 2004]. ideas weredevelopedbyphilosopherandpsychologistJohannFriedrichHerbart(1776-1841),who describedthemechanismaswellasthedevelopmentalaspectsofthecontrolofactionthrough ideas [Herbart 1825]. These ideas were further elaborated by others, such as philosopher Rudolf Hermann Lotze(1817-1881) andphysiologistEmil Harless (1820-1862). TheideasthatwereformulatedintheBritishandGermanpathslaterconvergedinthethink- ing and writings of William James (1842-1910), an American philosopher and psychologist [James 1890]. Although James adopted the term ideo-motor from Carpenter, his focus was broader like that of the Germans, and he believed that all everyday actions can be considered ideo-motor actions. That is, he believed that mental images guide and trigger our movements (andthusouractions),aslongasthereisnoconflictingmentalimagetopreventthemovement. Hesummarizedtheseideasinwhatiscalledtheideo-motorprincipleofvoluntaryaction:\"ev- ery representation of a movement awakens in some degree the actual movement which is its object; and awakens it in a maximum degree whenever it is not kept from doing so by an an- tagonisticrepresentationpresentsimultaneouslyinthemind\"[James1890,p.526].Jamesalso developed a theory of how our bodies aect our emotions. His core thesis on this idea was as follows: \"... the bodily changes follow directly the PERCEPTION of the exciting fact, and to include tools: \"Anything which participates in the conscious movement of our bodies is added to the model of ourselves and becomes part of these schemata.\" [Head and Holmes1911, p.188] Despitethishistoricalcontextandthefactthatbothphilosophersandscientiststhroughout the 19th and early 20th century worked to overturn Cartesian mind/body dualism, it took are view 2021-10-11 not for distribution138Chapter 4Theories ofEmbodiment while for these ideas to nd their way into the nascent area of HCI. In the next section, we lookattheimplicationsofphenomenologyandtheconceptoftheembodiedmindonthearea of HCIand more specicallyTEI. Implications fo r TEI Early approaches to HCI were Cartesian in nature and rooted in cognitivism [Wallace et al. 2007], a theoretical position that views cognition as the manipulation of internal representa- tionsofthingsintheworld,whichservestoguideactions.Fromthisperspective,thecomputa- tionalprocessingofinformationandtheinputsandoutputsto/fromthecomputationalsystem are modeled as separate entities, both conceptually and in practice. Examples include inter- action models like GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules) [car] and MVC (Model,View,Controller)[Burbeck1987].Similarly,classicalArticialIntelligence(AI)ap- proaches built on the dualistic view of mind and body, maintaining that intelligent behavior couldbeimplementedwithinacomputationalsystemalone,seee.g.NewellandSimon[1972]. Critiques of this view emerged in both the HCI and AI elds, grounded in the ideas of phenomenology and motor cognition described above. As such, we can continue to trace forward the philosophical and scientic paths examined above, looking at how they have been further developed, in particular with respect to the evolution and spread of computing technologies in society. Once again, we do not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the research and scholarship in these areas. Rather, we aim to examine some of the key ideas that have been influential within HCI, and discuss their implications on the design of TEI techniques and applications. A nice overview of these trajectories can also be found in Marshall andHornecker's Theories ofEmbodiment inHCI [2013]. F rom Phenomenology to TEI As computing technologies have become increasingly pervasive and HCI has evolved to stay on top of the ever-changing technological landscape, a number of researchers have been instrumental in bringing the core ideas of phenomenology to HCI, and phenomenological thinking to the writings of Heidegger. In Understanding ComputersandCognition:anewfoundationfordesign [1986],theydescribethewayinwhich objectsthatareready-to-handwillbecomepresent-at-handintheeventofabreakdown.They use the example of a word processor to illustrate these ideas in the context of technology.

Social and Situated Practice. Sociologist Harold Garnkel picked up on Alfred Schutz's work connecting phenomenology to our understanding of the social world, and formulated ethnomethodology as an approach for sociological study that is grounded in the everyday practices people engage in together in order to achieve social order [Garnkel 1967]. HCI researchers have drawn on this approach in studying our interactions with computational systems.Inparticular,Suchmandrewonethnomethodologyandconversationanalysis[Sacks 1992] in analyzing user interactions with a photocopier, revealing a mismatch between the xedmodelimplementedinthesystemandtheuser'sfluidbehaviorinconfrontingit[Suchman 1987]. Her work oers a strong critique of cognitivism, highlighting the fact that while plans (i.e., internal representations) can serve to guide action, they do not strictly determine action. Instead, behavior is an improvised activity that arises within a given context, and actions are thus situated. IntheTEIcontext,HorneckerandBuur[2006b]interweavethesocialandexpressivenature with the physical and material nature of tangibles, viewing tangible systems as resources for shared sense-making. Similarly, Van Dijk et al. [2014] describe design from the perspective of \"socially situated practice.\" This view reverses the way HCI designers have traditionally thoughtaboutdesigningcomputersystems,withtheiremphasisbeingonhowtoprovideways for users to access digital information. Instead, they propose that design should consider how computersystemscanconnecttopeople'sexistingembodiedandsocialpracticesintheworld (see Figure 4.9, left).

They can be classied into dierent groups according to their experiential basis, such as containment, space, force, attribute, etc. [Hurtienne 2017; Hurtienne and Israel 2007] (see Figure 4.10). Embodied metaphors map these embodied experiences onto a more abstract target domain.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution140Chapter 4Theories ofEmbodiment Figure 4.9 An illustration of Socially Situated Practice (left) from Van Dijk et al.

The Reactable (right) serves as an example of design that supports socially situated practice as it enables collaborativeconstructionofmeaningduringliveperformances[VanDijketal.2014][Photo Credit: Xavier Sivecas]. For example, proximity maps onto similarity, warmth maps onto aection, and up maps onto good (versus down for bad). From the TEI perspective, Hurtienne and Israel proposed using image schemas and their metaphorical mappings as a framework for both analyzing and designing tangible interfaces [HurtienneandIsrael2007].Theysuggestthatspaceandcontainmentschemasareparticularly interesting for tangible interface design since our interactions with tangibles necessarily take placeinspaceandinvolvecollectionsofrelatedobjects.Moreover,containersareoftenusedin tangibleinteractionsandareseeninothertangibleinteractionframeworks(seee.g.[Holmquist et al. 1999; Shaer et al. 2004b; Ullmer et al. 2005b]).

They describe a process that begins with enactment studies to identify relevant metaphors and follows through with the design and evaluation of prototypes of increasing delity. Embodiment in Tangible and Social Computing. In his book Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction [2001a], Paul Dourish provides a detailed discussion of Husserl, Heidegger, Schutz and Merleau-Ponty's ideas. He reflects on the dierent ways that the concept of embodiment plays a role in their thinking, while at the same time noting theirsharedemphasisontherelationshipbetweenembodiedactionandmeaning.AsDourish discusses, a central idea for these phenomenologists is that meaning exists in the world and arises through our embodied actions with the world and with each other. Based on this, he argues that phenomenology provides a starting point for understanding embodiedre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution4.4 Im plications forTEI 141 4.10 List ofimage schemas [Hurtienne and Israel 2007].

Extendingtheseconcepts,Klemmeretal.[2006]havediscussedthebenetsofthephysical world that are relevant for interaction design, synthesizing them into themes that address both the individual and social aspects of bodily actions. Importantly, they note that designers shouldbecarefulaboutunreflectivelyreplacingthephysicalworld,andshouldinsteadconsider how their solutions can integrate the physical and digital worlds, all the while leaving the physical world untouched to the extent possible. Similarly, Fernaeus et al. [2008] describe an action-centric perspectiveon tangible interactiondesign, whichis indirect contrastto adata- centric approach that views interaction design from an information processing perspective. They describe tangibles as resources for action, emphasizing that designers need to consider how users make meaning through their interactions withthe system. F rom Emb o died Cognition to TEI We have looked at how the philosophical ideas of phenomenology have made their way into TEI. In this section, we turn to the cognitive aspects that underlie the phenomenologicalre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution142Chapter 4Theories ofEmbodiment position. The concept of a link between action and imagination that was described by James andhispredecessors,aswellastheworkonbodyschemasbyHeadandHolmes,canbetraced forwardtoarangeofboththeoreticalandempiricalworkinthecognitivesciences.Thiswork is broadly captured by the term \"embodied cognition,\" and by other similar terms such as \"enaction\" and \"embodied mind\" [Varela et al. \"extended mind\" [Clark and Chalmers 1998]. Given the sheer breadth of related work, there is so far no unied view of embodied cognition. Nevertheless, Shapiro [2011] provides a nice overview perception and action. Gibson advanced the idea that perception is contingent on being and acting, as well as on the given and immediate environment as a whole. These ideas served as a foundation for an \"ecological\" approach to psychology [Gibson 1979a]. Perhaps most im- portantly in the context of HCI, Gibson coined the term \"aordance,\" which he described as follows:\"Theaordancesoftheenvironmentarewhatitoerstheanimal,whatitprovidesor furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to aord is found in the dictionary, the noun aor- danceisnot.Ihavemadeitup.Imeanbyitsomethingthatreferstoboththeenvironmentand the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and theenvironment.\"[Gibson 1979a,p.127] Don Norman [1988b; 1993] later adopted the concept of aordance (or more specically, perceived aordance) when considering how the form of an artifact suggests its function and use. Although this is how the term \"aordance\" was introduced to the HCI community, this view is limited as it suggests that aordances are like \"messages\" encoded in the physical form of artifacts [Van Dijk et al. 2014]. As we will see later in this section, aordances are dependent on and need to be considered in the much more nuanced context of a person's moment-to-momentcircumstancesandthewaytheyareactingintheworldovertime.Indeed, Norman later revised his terminology to reflect the dynamic nature of the physical and social worldinwhichweinteractbyproposingthattheterm\"signiers\"canserveasamoresuitable design principle than \"aordances\" [Norman 2008]. According to Norman, a \"signier\" is any kind of physical or social indicator, be it intentionally placed by the designer or merely accidental, that can help people understand how things in the world work and that can guide people'sbehavior. External Representations and Distributed Cognition. In his book Microcognition: Phi- losophy, Cognitive Science and Parallel Distributed Processing [1989], Andy Clark uses the example of a human solving a jigsaw puzzle to illustrate the importance of environmental structures in our cognitive processes. Creating a model of puzzle solving that disallows ma-re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution4.4 Im plications forTEI 143 nipulation of real physical pieces would require constructing a complete internal representa- tion of the shape and visual properties of every single puzzle piece. While the puzzle could be solved in this way, the solving process would be nothing like the process a person would follow to solve the puzzle. To solve a jigsaw puzzle, we combine our internal thought pro- cesses with physical actions on objects in the world. Through these physical actions, we test hypothesesandgeneratenewstatesofinformationthatinturnfeedourinternalprocesses.This isthecentralideaunderlyingthetheoryofdistributedcognitionproposedbyEdwinHutchins inCognitionintheWild [1995].Hutchins'formulationofdistributedcognitionwasinformed by his studies of the way intelligent behavior arises among a team of navigators on board a naval ship. The theory of distributed cognition views thinking as information processing that combines bothinternal andexternal representations. Thatis,cognition isdistributed between the brain and the environment, including the brains and bodies of multiple people, as well as physical objects and technologies. Hollan et al. [2000] subsequently proposed distributed cognition as a theoretical foundation for HCI research, using a combination of ethnographic studiesandcontrolledexperimentstosupportthedesignofcollaborativedigitalsystems.They emphasized the importance of \"in the wild\" observations of people's activities in a given de- sign context, in order to gain an understanding of how cognitive processes evolve over time and are distributedacross internal andexternal structures aswell associal groups. In related work, Kirsh and Maglio [1994b] looked at how interactions with external rep- resentations can support cognition. They showed that in the game of Tetris, players use what they called epistemic actions to re-organize the environment and reduce mental computation (see Figure 4.11, left). These actions include some of the rotations and translations of blocks thatplayersmakewhichdonotdirectlybringthemclosertotheirgoalofttingablockintoa particularspot.Incontrast, pragmaticactions haveasmainpurposetobringtheplayercloser totheirgoal.OfparticularrelevancetoTEI,AntleandWang[2013]comparedmotor-cognitive strategies in a tangible vs. a multi-touch puzzle-solving task by classifying the Design for Sensorimotor Coupling. Related to Gibson's insight that perception is active and grounded in the possibilities for action provided by the environment, the enactive approach proposed by Varela et al. [1991] considers cognition as an ongoing process of being coupled to the environment through sensorimotor activity. This idea underlies behavior-based robotics, in which robots navigate the world without internally representingandplanningactions,butratherthroughdirectsensorimotorinteractionwiththe environment[Brooks1991].Thewayinwhichsensorimotorinteractionwiththeenvironmentre view 2021-10-11 not for KirshandMaglio[1994b]lookedathowinteractionswiththegameofTetrissupportcognition (left), distinguishing between epistemic actions that re-organize the environment and reduce cognitive load, and pragmatic actions that bring the player closer to their goal. Antle and Wang [2013] compared a tangible vs. multi-touch puzzle solving task (right), nding that specic features of the tangible interface enabled more eective pragmatic and epistemic motor-cognitive strategies [PhotoCredit: SijieWang]. can replace representation can be illustrated by considering how baseball outelders catch a fly ball: instead of relying on a purely computational approach, they simply run in a way that keeps the ball in a straight horizontal line in their visual eld [Clark 1997; McBeath et al. 1995].Inthisway,theycanmakecontinualadjustmentstotheirrunningtrajectoryandspeed based on their visual perception, and thus end up exactly where they need to be in order to catch theball before itlands.

They note that this perspective can allow a more nuanced understanding of the term \"aordance\" discussed above. The way a person sees the world and the objects within it depends on how they are acting within it at any given moment. As result, the world and objects within it will show up as aording certain actions based not only on what is encoded into their physical form in a xed way, but also based on thecurrentsensorimotorcouplinginplace.Soforexample,asteephillmightseemclimbable or plications forTEI 145 Figure 4.12 An illustration of Sensorimotor Coupling and Enactment from Van Dijk et al.

Tool Use and the Enactive Landscape. An important aspect of the enactive approach is that it recognizes that our goals, interest and attention shape our perception.

Based on this, Kirsh [2013] introduced the idea of the \"enactive landscape\" as a way to capturethegoal,activityandskilldependentnatureofourperceptualexperienceoftheworld. As he suggests, this idea is important for designers to consider, because the tools we use and our level of expertise reshape our enactive landscape, changing our perception as well as our conception of what is possible. This draws on the idea of body schema described by Head and Holmes [1911] and the related concept of peripersonal space, which describes the region of space immediately surrounding the body and is viewed as a kind of interface for bodily interactions with objects that are within reach [Cardinali et al. 2009]. In seminal work with macaque monkeys, Iriki et al. [1996] found that the neurons coding the space near the hands of the monkeys expanded their representation to include objects near the tip of a rake, but only when the monkeys actively used the rake to perform an action (see Figure 4.13, left). This highlights the importance of purposeful interaction with the tool in order to essentially \"absorb\" the tool into the body's peripersonal space and incorporate it into the body schema. Further research has looked at how body changes and extensions can aect our sense of our own bodies and the world. For example, Iriki et al. [2001] showed that a monkey's brain can treat a large virtual hand as its own (see Figure 4.13, right), and van der Hoort et al. TheseideashavesomeinterestingimplicationsforTEIresearch.Foronething,investigat- ingifandwhenthetoolsandinterfaceswearedesigningareincorporatedintoourperipersonal space might help us understand how natural and intuitive they are.

CommonCodingasaFrameworkforDesign.The19thcenturyworkonmotorcognition and the action/imagination link can be traced to the common coding theory formulated by WolfgangPrinzandhiscolleaguesattheMaxPlanckInstituteforHumanCognitiveandBrain Sciences.Statedsimply,commoncodingtheorypositsasharedrepresentationinthebrainthat connects an organism's movements (action), its observation of movements (perception), and its imagination of movements [Prinz 1992, 2005]. As described by Chandrasekharan et al. [2010],thecentraloutcomeofcommoncodingisakindof\"body-basedresonance,\"inwhich the body instantly replicates all movements it detects (without necessarily overtly executing these movements). This replication generates an internal representation that is dynamic and based on body coordinates, and which can later be used in cognition. Common coding can explain people's ability to recognize their own movements even in an abstract form, such as a walking gure shown as points of light at key points of articulation. Mazalek et al. [2009] showed that people can identify not only their own body movements when presented in this abstractedform,butalsothemovementsofapuppettheycontrolled.Commoncodinghasalso beenshowntostretchacrossindividualsinasharedtask,eventhoughpeoplecoordinatebetter with theirown underlies embodied cognition, and this neural mechanism can serve as a kind of framework for designers. Indeed, Chandrasekharan et al. [2010] discuss the rele- vanceandapplicabilityofcommoncodingtoHCIandvideogamedesign,suggestingthatthe common coding mechanism can account for three cognitive eects of videogames: a prefer- ence eect (the connection players form with their virtual avatars), a cognitive augmentation eect (the way players extend their abilities through the game), and a discovery eect (the way players discover new ways of doing things through the game). In particular, they suggest that designers can leverage the common coding mechanism to design novel interactions and video games that enhance players' cognitive abilities. Building on these ideas, Mazalek et al. [2011] and Chang et al. [2017b] have shown how virtual characters that encode players' own movements can improve spatial abilities when those virtual characters are placed in spatial situationsthatwouldbeimpossiblefortheplayertoexperienceintherealworld.Forexample, when players experience novel rotation patterns through a virtual avatar that maps their own movements via a puppet interface, they improve their performance on a mental rotation test (seeFigure 4.14)[Mazaleketal.2011].Althoughtheresultsarequitepreliminary,thesestud- iesshowpromiseinusingthecommoncodingmechanismtotapintoandaugmentaperson's spatialabilitiesthroughacombinationoftangibleinterfacesandvirtualenvironments.Related to these ideas, Kirsh [2012] has shown through studies with dancers that visual perception of movements alone is not enough and that the involvement of the motor system is critical to learning. He suggests this may be because kinesthetic factors such as rapidly changing forces in our environment or bodies are dicult to detect visually and thus need to be picked up kinesthetically through actualmovement.

One last seed we want to plant coming from theoretical development is the name of this chapter\"Theoriesof embodiment\".Is embodimenttheappropriate labelto usefor ourwork? handles for designing? Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k made a plea during her keynote talk at TEI 2020 to go beyond the terms embodiment and embodied interaction. It is not that she questions our bodied being in the world. As Merleau-Ponty [Merleau-Ponty 1945b] (addressing the \"in the world\").Oeredasananalyticalconcept,butwithoutany\"direction\"oridealassociatedwith it.Itdoesnotanswerquestionslike:Isatangibleinteraction*better*thanonethatisentirely symbolic?

We learn the connections by and by. [H\u00f6\u00f6k, personal communication]. Hence, Kristina H\u00f6\u00f6k moved to somaesthetics by Shusterman [2008], as a more generative concept that could serve as a direction for what the \"gold standard\" of an interactioncouldbe,eventhoughitmightnotworkforalldesigndomains,e.g.itisunclearhow appropriate it is for language-/symbolic-oriented designs). Aesthetics in the way Shusterman speaks of it, concerns how we can live a better life. That we can improve on our somas. That we can experience *more* if we attend to our senses, if we develop them, if we move. This helped me see that: 1) as a designer, I can become better if I attend to my own somaesthetic appreciation of myself, of others, and of the materials we use to build systems; and 2) what I designshouldgiveend-usersthesameopportunity:toimproveontheirsomas. [H\u00f6\u00f6k,personal H\u00f6\u00f6k's plea for going embodiment is supported by other researchers, including anthropologists Sheets-Johnstone and Ingold.

She is not \"digital information;\" but there is much digital information surrounding both the sister herself, and the virtual and physical artifacts with which she interacts, that can be mediated. A formal - if abstract - denition of \"mediate\" aligned with our use is \"to eect (a result) or convey (a message, gift, etc.) by or as if by an intermediary\" [dictionary.com]. To make this more concrete, we consider several illustrative examplesof mediating remote human presence throughdiverse tangible \"intermediaries.\" The Switch that Lights One could argue that a light switch and overhead light are among the simplest of sensors and displays. In common architectural use, it is not uncommon for a single room to have multiple lights, mutually controlled by switches at each of several entrances. It is also increasingly common that the switches be connected to the Internet - e.g., as \"smart WiFi light switches\" - allowing them to beremotelycontrolled forconvenience andsecurity. Imagine that these switches and lights are redistributed between two rooms - one in our home, and one in that of our overseas sister. In this \"shared room,\" switching either light switch (here or there) turns overhead lights on or o in both rooms.

TEI systems are also not always concerned withor capable of physically sensing presence - e.g., with an ambient display, where system activity may beassociatedwith\"virtualsensors\"suchastriggerswithinonlinespace(e.g.,thereceipt ofanemail,changeinstateofanonlineservice,etc.)Inthisinterpretationofpresence2, anyartifactisprospectivelyindistinguishablefromeachother.Adeterminationof which particular object, person, etc. is present is thequestion of identity. Identity:in most cases, TEI sensing hinges not only on the presence of a physical entity, but also relative or absolute discernment of its identity. For example, RFID (radio fre- quencyidentication)tags,andmorerecentlytheirNFC(near-eldcommunication)tag variants,havebeenwidelyusedwithinTEIsystemsfordecades.Here,thedetermination of identity can be seen as matters of degree. E.g., some theft detection systems (in retail stores, libraries, etc.) monitor for (eectively) one-bit tags, monitoring the presence of a tag tuned to resonance within particular band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such tags are sometimes referred to as \"chipless RFID.\" This context concerns rudimentary discernment between tagged and untagged objects. Tags and readers tuned to dierent frequenciescan avoid \"false alarms\" andsupportdisparate uses. It is also common for RFID/NFC tags to establish \"unique\" identity, with (e.g.) 48-bit addresses comparable to the MAC hardware addresses of internet devices.

A sensor may be physically touching that which is being sensed, or not. The rst category is referred to as contact-based sensors; the latter, non-contact. Perhaps the simplest and best- known form of contact-based sensor are switches and buttons. Several examples of thesere view 2021-10-11 not for distribution158Chapter 5Mediating Technologies are illustrated in Figure 5.4a. Some of these incorporate a mechanical lever that extends the reach, increases the sensitivity, or otherwise transform how the switch is activated. These are often called \"leaf switches.\" Switches can be \"momentary\" (automatically turning o when released), as with most keyboards; or of \"alternate action\" (stably toggling on or o, as with many power switches). Historically, switches have been largely electromechanical in nature, with moving physical internal parts.

As an example of subjectivity, within Figure 5.8, we indicate strain gauges SGas pr oximal. For the present, our rationale is that most TEI deployments thus far have integrated strain gauges within tables or floors, toward sensing tangibles placed upon or removed from their sensing surface (whether direct ormechanicallycoupled).Thatsaid,thereisnothingspecictothesesensorsthatrequiresthis conguration; we regard it as historically descriptive, but not prescriptively constraining for futuresystems. Contact-based sensing is widely used within tangible interfaces, and can be technically straightforward to implement. However, in practice, especially as a system begins to have morecomponents-especiallycomponentsthatmove-reliabilityandscalabilityoftenbecome problematic. In general, unless a system incorporates spring-like elements that remain under pressure, reliable electrical contact is dicult to maintain, often resulting in intermittent failures. Even for systems with electromechanical interconnects that are reliable as pairs, as larger numbers of physical elements are introduced, reliability issues often compound. E.g., in the Block system of Marks et al. [Anderson et al. 2000], designs that were highly reliable forafewtangibleblocksexperiencedintermittenterrorsasthesystemexpandedtodozensof blocks. Non-contact senso rs For these reasons, the use of non-contact alternatives often supports more robust, reliable sensingwithinTEIsystems.Historically,amongthesimplestandmostcommonformsofnon- contact sensing involves magnets in proximity of a reed switch (Figure5.4.3a). One common place these are found is within window and door security systems (Figure 5.4.3b). Here, the magnet is typically embedded within the movable part of the window/door. When in close proximity to the magnet, the reed switch closes (\"turns on\"); away from the magnet, the reed switch re-opens (\"turning o\"). In the home/business security context, each reed switch can then be connected with long wires to some central controller, or relayed wirelessly through a radio transmitter. In similar fashion within tangible interfaces, a magnetic tag can be used to indicate the presence or absence of an artifact. Small constellations of magnets and reed switches canalso beused to determinethe classor identifyof anartifact.re view companion 5.1 (tech/gs/a1 ) magneticsensors: a)Plastic-encapsulatedreedswitch[photoviaBryggUllmer];b)mag- net and reed switched used within a window security system [By SparkFun Electronics - CC BY 2.0a]; c) 2D magnetic sensor grid used beneath tablet as an aggregate sen- sor[Liang et al. 2013]. ahttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/13247 Hall eect Where reed switches are electromechanical eect sensors are solid-state de- vicesthatcansensevaryingintensitiesofmagneticeld.Inadditiontobeingusedindividually, 2DarraysofHalleectsensorscanbeusedtomonitorthe2.5Dpositionandstrengthofmag- netictags.Amongotheradvantages,thisallowstheHalleectarraytobeplacedon(e.g.)the backside of a display screen/tablet/etc., and sense a magnetically tagged artifact on the other side. This is illustratedin Figure 5.4.3c [Lianget al.2013]. Today, among the most common and best-known non-contact sensors are capacitive sen- sors.In simplest form, electrical capacitors can be seen as two conductive (typically metal) plates, separated by some non-conductive material (the dielectric). Thus assembled, the ca- pacitor can \"hold an (electrical) charge,\" depending upon the properties of the plates and the dielectric. One possible dielectric is air itself. Alternately, more than 50% of the mass of the adulthumanbodyis(salt)water[Watsonetal.1980]makingthehumanbodysomewhatelec- tricallyconductiveatlowfrequencies.When(e.g.)angerorhandpasseswithinanair-based dielectric,this canbe capacitivelysensed. For tangible and embodied interaction, this eect can be realized with the simplest of sensors: a simple piece of wire. With the wire is attached to an embedded computer, one can rst \"charge\" the wire (connecting it to a positive voltage). If the attachment is changed from anoutputtoaninput,thecomputercanmonitorhowlongthewiretakesto\"discharge\"below some threshold. The duration is impacted by the (close) proximity of the human body, thus allowing use as a touch or close-proximity sensor. This capacitive sensing can be ofone ormultiple touches(multi-touch).Inadditiontotraditionalmetalwires(e.g.,copper),opticallytransparent conductors (e.g., indium-tin oxide, abbreviated ITO) as well as alternative materials and geometries4, are usedto realize 2Dtouch manuscript) [Public Domaina], illustrat- ing use of precious metals both as aesthetic and (prospectively) functional capacitive 4http://theconversation.com/touch-screens-why-a-new-transparent-conducting-material-is-sorely-needed-34703re view has come to widespread prominence in the 21stcentury, it holds implications for far older artifact. For example, one common denition of illuminated manuscripts (dating back more than 1,500 years) concerns the incorporation of metals (typ- ically gold or silver) upon the page [Ullmer 2012b]. In this respect, at least relative to their design and materiality, both existing and novel illuminated manuscripts can be regarded as inspiring latent examples of capacitive touch sensors. Wherecapacitivetouchscreensaretypicallydesignedforsensinghumancontact,asubstan- tial body of work has grown around using them to sense tangibles. Frequently, this takes the form of integrating capacitive touchpoints on a tangible. Variations here include metal (e.g., adhesive copper foil, as in Figure 5.4.3c); conductive epoxy;and electrically-conductive 3D 2018]. These conductive touchpoints are then electrically connected with an underyling touchscreen using a constellation of conductive pads that typ- ically allows the tagged artifact to be registered as present, identied, and tracked. Here, the pads emulate ngertips, and frequently are fabricated with materials intended as the tips of capacitive styluses(e.g., conductiverubber or woven metal mesh). Here, we have discussed active capacitive tracking of passive5ngertips and capacitively- taggedtokens.Sometimes,capacitivecommunicationsbetweentwoactivedevicesareutilized, to simultaneously serve both as a sensing and communications medium. Such capacitive communication was used in the parameter bars of [Ullmer et al. 2003a] and between the four sides of Sifteo cubes [Merrill et al. 2012]. For example, with Sifteo, the establishment of active communications on one or multiple of the four edges also implies physical adjacency of a known sister Sifteo (with known identity and orientation). Conversely, the absence of communications on a given edgeimpliesno detectableSifteosarepresent alongthat face.

The emitter can also be steady in its illumination; or often modulated (e.g., turning o and on thousands of times per second), allowing greater distinction from ambient illumination.

Figure system, they illustrate an articial marker specically with the purpose of digital identication. As noted, in practice, QR codes presently have several limitations for TEI.

Retroreflective tags - whether in the visible spectrum like Urp [Underkoer et al. 1999], or infrared such as Vicon and OptiTrack - also hold the advantage of tolerating more lighting variabil- ity, teasing apart ducials from background imagery, and (somewhat correspondingly) allowing high-precisiontracking. 8https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/1zifgz/how_do_these_japanese_arcade_table_games_work/, http: //kanryuhobby.blog58.fc2.com/blog-category-25.htmlre view digital tags);c) ZanzibarNFC +multitouch sensing2D array sensor As mentioned, while CV has been most frequently employed with optical technologies, it has broader applications.

Instead, object identity was implicitly/heuristically estimated by the combination of electronic tags (which, implemented later, would have usedre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution5.4 Sensing 169 RFID or NFC tags) and computer vision. Magnetic eld sensing was used to track the 2D passive lens and 3D active lens; but at considerable (several thousand dollar) cost per sensor, and withwiredsensors. In this example, sensor fusion was used to achieve hybrid capabilities that no individual technology could then achieve. In a more recent example, Microsoft Zanzibar interweaves a 2DarrayofNFCsensingantennawitha2Darrayofcapacitivesensingelements.Sensorfusion can also realize other benets. For example, RFID/NFC is often relatively energy intensive. If, in an example analogous to Zanzibar, one or many magnetic reed switches or Hall eect sensorsarecombinedwithRFID/NFCreaders,theRFID/NFCantennacanbeenergizedonly when magnetically-sensed updates are sensed. In this fashion, energy consumption can be dramaticallylowered,sensorcostsdecreased,andsensingresolutionsincreased,atthecostof increasedsystem complexity. In addition to multi-sensor fusion, sensors and displays can be creatively combined to yieldneworhigher-delitycapabilities.Forexample,\"structuredlight\"typicallycombinesof visibleorinvisibleprojectionwithcomputervisionorotheropticalelements.Inonevariation, one or multiple visible or infrared grids are projected into the world. Strategicaly aligned camera sensing of these grids is used to correlate deformations in the projected pattern with 3D spatial positions. In notable commercial examples, both the Microsoft Kinect and Apple TrueDepth (e.g., within the iPhone X) rely upon the projection of constellations of low- intensity infrared dots. Many alternate variations of structured light are possible. For instance, in one mode of operation, in 2020, the TI LightCrafter projector modulates each pixel up to 9,523 Hz with binarypatterns,orupto247Hzwith8-bitgrayscalepatterns.Thisallowseachprojectedpixel to broadcast a location or other data to tangibles, robots, etc. within the eld. This has been used compellingly towardtangiblesin [LeGoc et al.2016]. Another variation is actuated sensing. In an early variant, mobile robots have been used to adaptively relocate sensors within a larger volume [Singh et al. 2006]. In a variation novel to this book, in the Appendix, we show several systems where one or multiple NFC/RFID readers(potentiallyinasensorfusioncongurationwithHalleectmagneticsensorsorother elements) are rotated or translated through a larger volume. This is partially reminiscent of electromechanical hard disk drives, where the combination of a spinning platter and actuated arm tipped with a sensor is used to physically access large quantities of digital information. Such an approach, applied to NFC sensing, can also leverage decades of algorithms in hard disk seek optimization. For some scenarios, such as illustrated in Figure A.7and partially elaborated in the Appendix, such actuated sensing approaches can oer relatively trackingtechnologies.re 2021-10-11 Ullmer) Displa ys and actuation Without sensing, the realms of computing are left blind to physicality, and particularly to human interactions within the physical world. In a similar vein, displays and actuation are the paths by which people gain vantages within tangibles and into the cloud - to observing and engaging the computational mediations underlyingTEI. We rst consider agency and proximity in display and actuation contexts (Figure 5.1). We then surveydisplayand actuationtechnologies ofparticular relevance to TEI. Agency and p ro ximit y As with sensing, while there exist theoretically rigorous interpretations of passive vs. active agency from electrical engineering perspectives, we briefly consider an interpretation of rel- evance to broader audiences. Most flat-panel displays (whether LCD, LED, plasma, etc.) are examples of active devices. In a simple illustration, if power is removed, the visual display disappears.Oneinterpretationofapassivedisplaywouldbeaprintedvisualelement(whether by hand, inkjet or laser printer, 3D printer or router, etc.).

However, if power is removed, even the simplest rotary or linear motor frequently acts as a passive me- chanical constraint. In another example, some particle brakes (as a particular kind of electro- magnetic brake) with integrated controllers oer haptic mediation of mechanical detents, etc. These can be regarded as including both active and passive (resistive/dissipative) facets. In another variation, systems of levers, gears, pulleys, springs, and other forms of mechanical constraint are frequently present within TEI systems. These generally are passive in nature; though are frequently combined with active elements (e.g., solenoids or servomotors). Aswithsensors,displaysandactuationcanbeintegral,proximal,ordistaltothetangibles they mediate. For \"active tangibles\" with embedded displays or actuators, the technology is integral. If a tangible sits atop (e.g.) a mediating graphical display, or upon a surface using vibrationormagnetismtoactuatetangibles,therelationshipisproximal.Oftenthedistinction between proximal and distal can be subjective and a matter of degree. For example, when a graphicalprojector(forEuropeanreaders,beamer)isusedtoprojectivelyilluminateatangible workspace, is this proximal or distal? A picoprojector used in a Luxo armature mount from a 1m distance might be regarded as proximal, with a ceiling-mounted projector as distal; but this distinction is likelybest regardedas agradientand matters of degree.

In Figure 5.14, we visually illustrate a variety of point sources of active articial illumi- nation. Incandescent (Figure 5.14a) and neon (5.14b) are the oldest of these. While requiring more electrical current than can be provided directly by output lines of embedded micropro- cessors, they canbe indirectlycontrolled via(e.g.) solidstaterelaysand powertransistors. The nature of both visual indicators and lighting at large has dramatically transformed thanks largely to light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Red LEDs rst reached economical commer- cial viability in the late 1960s. Red and (later) green LEDs were followed by blue and white LEDsinthe1990s,reachinglightlevelssuitableforilluminationintheearly2000s[Choetal. 2017].

First, the brightness of conventional xed-color LEDs can be controlled through a technique called pulse-width modulation (PWM). Here, the LED is rapidly cycled on and o, typically with frequencies in the kHz range12. The level of brightness can be controlled by varying the fraction of time the waveform is maintained at the supply-level vs. ground-level state. Many microcontrollers include hardware PWM support, allowing this modulation to be conducted \"in the background,\" without continually consuming computational resources. An increasing fraction of LEDs are both electronically addressable, and host multiple internal LEDs of dierent color spectrums. The electronic addressing aspect allows multiple LEDs - whether 10 or 10 million - to be controlled over a shared address and/or data lines (rather than each requiring independent wiring).

In addition to LEDs,other consumption. These individual points, lines, or elds of illumination can be employed in TEI systems directly, or as backlights or illuminators for textual or visual displays.

Several approaches are illustratedin Figure 5.6.1. ) NeoPixel symbols/glyphs selectively illuminated within a single discrete component.

We next consider some of these implications. Similar trends and extrapolations could be made with flat-panel display technology, spatial imaging technology, and others. Our considerations are intended to be illustrative, and our methods partially generalizing to these other mediating technology regimes. First, we briefly consider three envisionments of scaled-up projective mediation within room-scale spaces, as [Naimark 1984, 2005]). There, a video camera recorded a 14https://www.oled-info.com/oled-inkjet-printing, https://www.graphene-info.com/graphene-3d-lab-les-patent-3d-printer-can-print-graphene-based-oledre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution5.6 Displa ys 177 space,whilesittingonanactivatedrotaryplatform.Allsurfacesofadomesticspace-couch, table, paintings, walls, and floors - were then painted white. Finally, the slowly spinning camera was replaced with a projector, with playback begun in angular synchrony. While Naimark useda singleprojector,his concept generalized far moreambitiously: The image source may be a remote video camera or it may be from a computer database.... A relationship exists between display and interactivity. Consider lling all surfaces ofa mediaroom withimagery...[Naimark 1984] In a related spirit, while we have discussed Underkoer et al.'s \"Urp\" urban planning exampleinChapter1,thiswasoneofalargerfamilyofdemonstrationsofhis\"luminousroom\" and \"I/O bulb\" [Underkoer 1999]. these parallel\"OceoftheFuture\"workbyRaskaretal.[Raskaretal.1998]includedanillustration Michael Naimark); These are well-complemented by numerical grounding relating to projection technol- ogy.

As one example, the two most expensive 2018-vintage laser-based projectors we consider have lumen (brightness) outputs of 31,000 and 75,000 lumens. These units are billed as \"large venue\" projectors. For example, a July 2017 press release describes projective illumination of the Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles)with projector#7:re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution5.6 projection on a [large building] fa\u00e7ade typically cannot be seen until sunset or shortly thereafter....

Other sister computational elements include eld- programmablegatearrays(FPGAs),digitalsignalprocessors(DSPs),graphicprocessorunits (GPUs), and others. As noted, these have been used within tangible interfaces, but with less frequentuse to date.They presently gobeyondour scopeof consideration. Microprocessorsareoftenregardedasmoregeneral-purposecomputationalelements,with microcontrollers oriented more toward embedded control of sensors and actuators. In some cases (especially in earlier decades), microprocessors and microcontrollers require some or many external components to function. Driven by miniaturization and cost reductions toward (e.g.) smartphones, entire computational systems have often been reduced to a single chip or hybrid circuit element. This has greatly reduced the cost and complexity of designing and deploying tangible interfaces.

Human body caneasilycoverlargerareathandesktopfabricationdevices,whilecomputercanprovide detailedcontrol. Early examples in this approach are FreeD and Routers. FreeD is a hand held milling device. The user roughly places the tool head around the target, and the system adjust the position of the tool head to curve out a target shape from the material. Router is a hand-held sawing machine. The user roughly moves the tool along the target curve, and the system makesdetailedadjustments tothe positionof theblade.

We believe that the human-computer hybrid fabrication is a powerful approach that is applicable to many other applications. Humans and machines have complementary strengths each other, and it is best to combine them to build ecient and eective fabrication systems.

Tool manufacture and use has been observed in species as diverse as elephants, many primates, dolphins, and more than thirty families of birds. The homescraftedbyspeciesasdiverseastermitesandbeavers-andevenbacteriacreatingtheir own eco-system - further illustrates the diverse heritage of fabrication. While whole books and encyclopedias have been completed for various genres of crafts and manufacturing, we only briefly surveythis broad spaceof pursuit. Craft and Craftsmanship Sennett[2008]wrotethecanonicalbook TheCraftsman inwhichheexplainscraftasthedesire todoajobwellforitsownsake.Itisadesireforquality,buildingonthedevelopmentofskill, driven by the motivation to do well, and based on the close connection between hand and head. To start with, the latter \"Every good craftsman conducts a dialogue between concrete practicesandthinking;thisdialogueevolvesintosustaininghabits,andthesehabitsestablish a rhythmbetweenproblemsolvingandproblemnding.\" The keynote speaker at TEI2015, Frank Wilson, dedicated his career to hands. Wilson [1998] clearly indicated that \"the brain does not live inside the head, even though it is its formal habit. It reaches out to the body, and with the body it reaches out to the world. ... brainishandandhandisbrain.\". Sennett[2008],Wilson[1998]and Ingold[2013]stressthe uniqueness of the hand, with its flexible independently moving ngers, its nails and sensitive nger pads, and its precision grip that is enabled through the rotating thumb opposite to the ngers. In this dialogue between hand and head the skill can develop, always beginning as a bodilypractice.Throughtouchingandmovingandusingoneshands,knowledgeandskillscan develop. For this process and understanding, Sennett[2008] considers imagination to be key, groundedinambiguityandresistancewhichbothcanbeconsideredasinstructiveexperiences that spark imagination.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution190Chapter 5Mediating Technologies Figure 5.26 imaginationindevelopinghisskillstorepairandtoimprovise.Thethirdaspect considersessentialforcraftsmenisthefocusonmotivationinsteadoftalent: \"Thecraftsman's desire for quality poses a motivational danger: the obsession with getting things perfectly right may deform the work itself. We are more likely to fail as craftsmen, I argue, due to our inabilitytoorganizeobsessionthanbecauseofourlackofability.TheEnlightenmentbelieved that every-one possesses the ability to do good work of some kind, that there is an intelligent craftsman in most of us; that faith still makes sense.\" Figure5.26shows our interpretation of Sennett'sunderstandingofcraftsmanship,whichsoclearlyshowswhytangibleandembodied interaction is so interwoven with craftsmanship and making. It also gives us a warning. We might focus on developing tangible and embodied interactions that celebrate the hand, but if wedonotutilizeourhandsduringthemakingprocessandwouldmovemoreandmoretotools thatdonotsupportimagination,donottriggerourcuriosity,bypassoursensesandabilitiesof the Ingold[2013] shows not only the importance of the hand, the skills and the craftsman's attitude, but also the role of the material. He sees it as the dance of agency in which \"bodily kinaesthesia interweaves contrapuntally with the flux of materials within an encompassing morphogenetic eld of forces.\" So, the gesturing hands of the potter on the wet clay can be seen as a contraposition of equal forces which is also enabled by the rotation of the wheel, or as Ingold indicates, the wheel needs to correspond with the clay. And this threesome, e.g.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution5.9 F abrication 191 potter-wheel-clay,appliestoallmakingalsoe.g.player-musicalinstrument-soundorflyer - kite - air. So, throwing a pot on a wheel or performing music is not merely interacting with the tool or instrument, it is corresponding with the clay or the sound. Ingold[2013, p102] calls these tools transducers, which \"convert the ductus - the kinetic quality of the gesture, itsflowormovement-fromoneregister,ofbodilykineasthesia,toanother,ofmaterialflux.\" It seems that our current technology is slowly but certainly reducing the ductusof the entire handandmovingtowardsthengertips,e.g.byfocusingmoreonbuttonsandsmallinteractive screens.Thedierencebetweengraphicalandembodiedinteractionstressesexactlytheroleof theductusoftheentirebody.Traditionalcrafttechnologies,suchaspapercrafts,ceramicsand glasscrafts,textileandleathercrafts,orwood,stoneandmetalcraftscaninspireustoembrace craftsmanship and making during our own development processes, and show us ways to tap intoanothermaterialqualityandshowusawaytoapproachthedanceofagency.Notonlywith respecttothematerialsused,theskillsofthecraftsmen,butalsothemanufacturingprocesses with itstransducingtools, [2020]weseethehighestpref- erencefortheuseofplastics,aswellasapreferenceformetal,woodandpaperwithintheTEI community.

As with craft and manufacturing processes, personal fabrication is generally regarded as either \"subtractive\" or \"additive.\" In the subtractive realm, laser cutting has come to be particularly popular. Driving factors include ease of design (e.g., with mainstream software like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW); ease of xturing (holding the materials view 2021-10-11 for distribution192Chapter 5Mediating Technologies thicker,alternatematerials(e.g.,metal,stone,andpolycarbonate);orsometimes,reducedsize and cost.

Using these personal fabrication machinery does however not per denition have to imply that the ductus and imagination is diminished, but it does require another attitude towards these machines and also the development of new skills to explore these machines in dierent ways. For example, L\u00e9vy and Yamada [2017];Yamada [2016] worked on the aesthetics of the imperfection while designing artefacts for a Japanese TeaCeremony,wheretheyexploredthenotionofimperfection,inspiredbytheworkof Yanagi [1989]. They used new production techniques like 3D-modeling and 3D-printing and left the agency of creating imperfection to the 3D-printer by changing the printing speed. This way the 3D-printer would not be able to produce \"nearly perfect\" artefacts, but rather create un- plannable imperfection in order to obtain beautiful irregularities. It seems however that such newcreativewaysofusingthesetoolshavehardlyenteredtheTEIcommunity.Hence,wedo inviteyouembracetheperspectiveof Ingold[2013]andalsoaimingtohavedancesofagency with such new transducers like 3D printers and laser cutters, where it is not about interact- ing with the these machines, but nding new contrapositions of equal and opposing forces enabling ustocorrespond innew ways withmaterials. T echnology T o olkits Toolkits have long played an important role in HCI research and design, as they provide reusableabstractionsthatsimplifytheprocessofworkingwithdierentsoftwareandhardware technologies[Myersetal.2000].PerMarquardtetal.[2017],toolkitscanbebroadlydenedas \"asetofsoftwareandhardwarecomponents,programs,routines,buildingblocks,toolchains, concepts and interfaces that are used to prototype, design, develop, maintain and deploy interactivecomputing systems.\" As can be seen from the above sections, the sheer breadth of mediating technologies that are used to support sensing, display, actuation, communication and fabrication in the TEI domainhasgivenrisetoavarietyofdierenttoolkitsandframeworks.Whileacomprehensive taxonomyoftoolkitsisbeyondthescopeofthisbook,weprovideabriefoverviewofseveral threadsoftoolkit-relatedworkthatarespecicallyrelevantforthedesignofTEIsystems.Note that these threads are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and that some toolkits may support design anddevelopment acrossmore computervision. In an early example is the Phidgets [Greenberg and Fitchett2001a]toolkit,whichprovidesarangeofphysicalinputandoutputcomponents(e.g., buttons, sliders, touch sensors, motors), and makes their functionality accessible through a software-based API. Conceptually, Phidgets advanced the idea of \"physical widgets\" as a counterpart to GUI widgets. Other electronics prototyping toolkits include Arduino [Mellis the design of wearables and other textile-based artifacts. Collectively, these and other related tools have helped to make physical computing broadly accessible to the interaction design community.

Cross-Device Interaction T o olkits Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in cross-device interaction toolkits to support the development of applications that span multiple (typically screen-based) devices, such as smartphones, tablets, interactives tables and interactive walls. Brudy et al. [2019] provide a comprehensive survey of this space, noting that there has been little consistency in the terminology used to describe the dierent kinds of toolkits that have been created and the types of interactive computing systems they support. Notably, they provide a taxonomy of key characteristics to scope and frame the cross-device interaction design space. The six dimensions they use to dene cross-device systems are: 1) Temporal - are the interactions synchronous or asynchronous? 2) Conguration - is the system setup mirrored, distributed, migratoryorcross-platform?3) Relationship -whatarethepeople-to-devicerelationships?4) Scale- is the physical scale of the system near, personal, social, or public? 5) Dynamics - is thesystemsetupadhoc/mobile,semi-xedorxed?6) Space-aretheinteractionsco-located or remote. Particularly relevant to the TEI domain are cross-device interaction toolkits that support notonlyscreen-baseddevices,butalsotangibleand/orembodiedinteractions.Anearlyexam- ple is iROS, an event-based software infrastructure that was designed to support the iRoom interactiveworkspaceenvironment[Johansonetal.2002].iROSsupportedthevariousiRoom components, such as touch-sensitive whiteboard displays, an interactive wall and table, wire- less buttons, and an overhead scanner that could be used to digitize sketches and other physi- calmaterialsplacedonatabletop.Otherexampletoolkitsthataddressdierentaspectsofthe for distribution5.10 T echnology Toolkits 195 Figure 5.28 The Responsive Objects, Surfaces and Spaces (ROSS) API [Wu et al. 2012] is a toolkit to support application development in the TEI/cross-device design space.

Web companion 5.8 (tech/gs/a8 ) FormFab [Mueller et al. 2019] is an interactive fabrication tool in which users control the sculpting of thermoplastic material in real-time using hand gestures to (a) keep the plastic at its current level, or to (b) increase pressure or (c) decrease pressure / switch to vacuum, in order to shapethe plasticoutward orinward,respectively. Some fabrication toolkits are designed for a very specic and narrow set of design tasks, such as the SketchChair [Saul et al. 2010] tool for designing and building chairs, and the Pteromys [Umetani et al. 2014] tool for creating custom gliders. Other toolkits tackle a somewhat broader space, such as the Enclosed [Weichel et al. 2013] tool for generating enclosures for electronic prototypes, and the RetroFab [Ramakers et al. 2016] design and fabrication tool for retrotting various legacy devices such as old household appliances to allow for automation, remotecontrol,andinterconnection. The \"interactive fabrication\" space mapped out by Willis et al. [2010] oers another approachtosupportingphysicalfabrication.Ininteractivefabrication,usersareprovidedwith the controls to operate digital fabrication devices in real time, thereby bringing the creative designandconstructionpartsoftheprocessclosertogether.Forexample,CopyCAD[Follmer etal.2010]usesacameraandprojectorsystemtoallowuserstosketchdirectlyontoaphysical object,andthenhavethesesketchescutdirectlyintotheobjectwitha3-axismillingmachine.

As these examples show, research on fabrication toolkits has tackled dierent parts of the design and fabrication process, addressing some of the challenges that non-experts face in making physical things.

This chapter focuses on designing tangible and embodied interaction. How to create meaningful interactions, and how to ride the notion of tangibility and embodiment (or should we say animacy after Ingold [2013] instead of interaction?), and how to play with the richness and anddynamics tot theskills to ways. Hummels [2012] explains these dierent ways with the example of a skateboarder trying to jump a ridge: \"Firstly, the world opens up through the actual shape and innate capacities of the human body; the ridge is jumpable because the skateboarder has legs that can bend and stretch to generate the power to jump, and he has two feet that give him stability on the skateboard. Secondly, we have skills for coping with the world, and as we rene these skills, e.g. by practising jumping with the skateboard, thingsshowupassolicitingourskilfulresponses,sothataswereneourskills,weencounter moreandmoredierentiatedsolicitationstoact.Thus,whileimprovinghisskillsofjumping, the skateboarder perceives his environment dierently and sees more and more possibilities for jumping. Thirdly, the cultural world has a relationship with our body. Only because we Western Europeans are brought up with skateboards in concrete cities where it is OK to jump on benches, specic ridges solicit the skateboarder to jump on them [Dreyfus 1996].

As the example shows, technologies like skateboards and public furniture are not neutral, but a medium between humans (with specic skills, experiences and a specic socio-cultural history) and the world (with its specic socio-cultural, technological, economic, political, religious, spiritual, ... dimensions). Humans, technology and the world are an inseparable 199re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution200Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI unity,constitutingeachotherininteraction.Thisimpliesthatwhendesigningnewtechnology, we have to explore and question how to support the creation of meaning in interaction. Or as Dourish[2001c]issaying \"thedesignconcernisnotsimplywhatkindsofphysicalskills,say, wemightbeabletocapitalizeuponinatangibleinterface,orwhatsortsofcontextualfactors we can detect and encode into a ubiquitous computing model. Instead, we need to be able to consider how those skillsor factors contribute tothemeaningfulness ofactions.\" This brings us automatically to the questions, what is meaningfulness and how to design for it? In order not to drown in a deep philosophical debate, we take a rather down to earth approachinthischapter,whereweapproachthecreationofmeaningfromanaestheticspoint of view. Semantic versus Emb o died App roach When looking at aesthetics, we see two main approaches to create meaning in tangible and embodied interaction: the semantic approach and the direct approach [Djajadiningrat et al. 2002a;Fishkin2004], althoughin practicetheycan beintermingled. The semantic approach is based on cognition and semantics, using symbols and signs to communicate information [Aldersley-Williams et al. 1990; Krippendor and Butter 1984], oftenbymeansofmetaphorsreferringtotheshapes,motionsormanipulationsofotherobjects, animalsorpeople.Thesemanticapproachisabouttheknowable[Djajadiningratetal.2002a]. in and design emotions [Demirbilek and Sener 2003] can be considered semantic. Examples within the eld of TEI are, e.g., TOBE (Tangible Out-of-Body Experiences) (see Figure 6.1top left), a skills, hence it will always partly rely on the second approach: the direct or embodied approach. This approach is based on our action possibilities, and the notion that our skillful bodyissolicitedbythesituationtryingtondmaximumgriponthesituation[Dreyfus1996; Merleau-Ponty 1962]. Interaction is based upon aordances in relation to our eectivities, i.e., what we can perceive and what we can do with our body in a specic situation [Gibson 1979b]. The direct or embodied approach is about the [Djajadiningrat et al. 2002a]. Somaesthetics [H\u00f6\u00f6k 2004]areapproachesbasedonembodimentandthedirectapproach.Forexample, Rasmussen et al.[2016] developed Reflex, a shape-changing phone which is developed to enhance our perceptual-motor skills, even though it still has links to semantics, e.g., when the phone is pulsating up and down to attract attention and indicate that there is an upcoming meetingre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.1 Intr oducing Aesthetics ofInteraction 201 Figure 6.1 Semantics in TEI, (top) TOBE is an avatar to express a person's inner state [Gervais et al. 2016]; (bottom) embodied metaphors are used to control the slides in live presentations [Hemmert and Joost2016] (see Figure 6.2on the left).

Moto, developed to support a direct approach, consists of a water reservoir and by moving one or two tools through it, a person can create a musical expression. Not to a surprise, resonance is an individual experience and highly dependent upon the person and the situation at hand. Nevertheless, we did see that control and experiencing the relation between cause and eect increases resonance. This does not mean that there has to be unity of location, direction, modality and time with respect to the user's actions and the product'sfeedback.However,anaturalmappingbetweenproductappearance,interactionand resulting feedback is important.

Gillian Crampton Smith explains Tony Dunne's concept of \"aesthetics of use\" being \"an aesthetics which, through the interactivity made possible by computing, seeks a developing and more nuanced cooperation with the object - a cooperation which, it is hoped, might enhance social contact and everyday experience. Such an aesthetics, clearly, attends less to how an object looks, the traditional concern of product aesthetics, than to how it behaves\" [Crampton Smith].re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.1 Intr oducing Aesthetics ofInteraction 203 Figure 6.3 The installation ISH (top) enables the creation of image and soundscapes (Reprinted by permission from Springer Nature: Springer, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, Move to get moved: a search for methods, tools and knowledge to design for expressive and rich movement-basedinteraction,HummelsC.,Overbeeke,K.andKlooster,S.Copyright \u00a92006, Springer-VerlagLondonLimited)CoppiaEspressiva(middleandbottom)teststhedierence betweenusingasemanticapproachversusadirectorembodiedapproach.Pocousesphycons to createmusic (bottom left) and Moto (bottom right) usestools to directly manipulate music through movement[Hummels not for distribution204Chapter the of use 1987]. So, aesthetics is notaninherentpropertyoftheartefactitself,butitisaresultofthehumanappropriationand use of the artefact. Or as said above, meaning is created in interaction. Petersen et al. [2004] elucidate this by saying that \"the chair is not aesthetic in itself but rather the aesthetic chair is a result of the socio-historical appreciation of the material, and the shapes. Accordingly our ability to engage in an aesthetic experience is based on our social context, manifested inapersonalbodilyandintellectualexperienceprolongedbeyondtheimmediateexperience. According to the thinking in pragmatist aesthetics, aesthetic is not something a priori in the world, but a potential that is released in dialogue as we experience the world; it is based on valuable userelationsinfluencing the construction ofour everydaylife.\" In general, aesthetics of interaction can be considered to be a sense of beauty which arisesduringthedynamicinterplaybetweenauserandanartefactintheircontext[Hummels 2000a]. The aesthetics of interaction or pragmatic aesthetics refers to aect that arisesduring interaction, and according to Locher et al. [2010] it is closely related to Cs\u00eckszentmih\u00e1lyi and Robinson's flow experience [Cs\u00eckszentmih\u00e1lyi and Robinson 1990], which states that individuals engage art objects \"not because they expect a result or reward after the activity is concluded, but because they enjoy what they are doing to the extent that experiencing the activity becomes its own reward.\" The deep involvement in interacting with the artwork is the main goal. Locher et al. [2010] consider that this deep involvement when experiencing art is the same type of involvement during an aesthetic experience with interactive products and systems. This aesthetic experience is not merely linked to a bodily experience nor only a cognitive experience, but the aesthetic experience speaks to both the mind and the body. Accordingto Petersenetal. [2004],thisimpliesthatwhendevelopingtangibleandembodied interaction, we should not merely focus on gratifying our bodily perceptual-motor skills, but also challenge and please our intellectual capacity by sparking our imagination and enabling people to make sense of complex, contradictory and even ambiguous systems and situations, asGaveretal.

In the remaining part of this chapter, we will discuss these three dimensions related to the aesthetics of tangible and embodied interaction to support developers during their design process. Firstly, we will elucidate various ways in which TEI-oriented designs can enable and anticipate possibilities for interaction and experience, and how they can be appropriated and used by people. Thereupon, we describe the design dimensions when starting from the person and his body: the values, skills, multi-modalities, concepts of the body and spectrum of movements. In the third section, we focus on the design dimensions of the tangible and embodied device itself to realise aesthetics in interaction: its material and dynamic qualities. We conclude this chapter with dierent design processes and principles that can support the quest forthe aesthetics ofinteraction. V a riet y of P ossibilities, embodied, hermeneutic,alterity,backgroundandcyborgrelations.Withembodiedrelations,Idherefersto technologythattransformsahuman'sactionalandperceptualengagementwiththeworld,e.g. apairofglassesenablesustoseetheworldsharper.Hermeneuticrelationsrefertotechnology which requires our interpretation, e.g. when a thermostat shows 20\u00b0C / 68\u00b0F in a room, we have learned to understand what this number means. Alterity relations occur when humans interact with a technology as a quasi-other, e.g. we are having a kind of 'dialogue' with the interfaceof theATM machinewhen makinga cashwithdrawal. Ihde[1995] indicates a fourth, more passive background relation, which is not directly noticeable and only appears when a situation drastically changes, is broken or when putting specicattentiontowardsit,e.g.whensuddenlyhearingthesoundofthefridgewhentheroom becomesuncomfortablyquiet.Lastly, RosenbergerandVerbeek [2015a]addcyborgrelations tothefourpreviousones,referringtotechnologiesthatmergewithourphysicalbody,so-called fusionrelations,suchasapacemaker,ortotechnologiesthatmergewithourenvironment,so- called immersion relations, such as an intelligent lighting system that automatically turns on and adjuststhe lightingcondition ofTEI In the rst two chapters of this book, we already saw a large variety of designs which can be mapped according to these ve relations. However, from a design perspective, this categorisationofrelationsisrathercoarse,andoneneedstoaddressmoredetailedandnuanced aspects during the design process. Most of the time a combination of various relationships is used instead of one single relation. For example, if we look at the Reactable from Jord\u00e0 et al.[2007b] as also discussed in chapter 1, we see that when a person turns the dials, the objectsfeelasanextensionofthehandwhenturning(embodiedrelation),whiletheiconsand graphical feedback surrounding them have to be interpreted in order to understand what they mean (hermeneutic relation). Moreover, the beamer and tracking technology underneath the table isgenerallynot noticedduringinteraction (background relation). Next to this, the ve relations proposed by Idhe, Rosenberg and Verbeek seem to refer mostlytoperceptual-motorskillsandcognition,whereasemotionalandsocial-culturalaspects seem less explicit in their model. Although we see Idhe' and Verbeek's types of relations as veryuseful,theyarenotallencompassingforthepurposeofdesigningtangibleandembodied interaction. Hence, in this chapter, we've used the combination of these ve relations as a starting point to scan TEI-related publications in journals and conference proceedings over theyears,andwecomplementedthese5relationswithotherswhereneeded.Thishasresulted in the following classication of designs and interactions that focus on mediating relations with adierentscope regarding possibilities,invitation andappropriation (seeFigure 6.4): 1.

Wedonotpretendtohavecreatedacompleteoverviewnoranoverviewwithoutoverlapping categories. The aim of this classication is showing the broad scope of possibilities, and supporting developers to examine and question their own intentions with their designs. Mind you, this doesn't imply that people using the designs will automatically appropriate or use them in a similar way as was intended by its maker. Ihde [1995] indicates that technologies aremulti-stable,meaningthattheycanhavedierentinterpretations,intentionsandidentities. Hence, technology might mean something dierent and aord dierent interactions for its users than intended by the creator. Moreover, in this overview, we might also have stressed our interpretation of the design, which might conceal a dierent connotation of the device as intended by its maker. Catego ry 1: Sensing and Extending the Bo dy Wediscerninthiscategorytwodirectrelationshipswithourbody,onewheretechnologyhelps us to sense our body, and another where we use technology as an on or in body extension of our person's perceptual-motor skills.Both willbe elucidatedin thissection (seeFigure 6.5). Sensing and embodied interaction starts from the body, capitalising on our physical skills and supporting our lived experience. One of the basic possibilities of embodied interactionre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution208Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI Figure 6.5 Category 1: Sensing and extending thebody (picturebyCaroline Hummels). is connecting us with our own body, enabling us to sense our body and increase awareness, whichisalsostudiedbysomatics: \"Somaticsistheeldwhichstudiesthe'soma':namelythe body as perceived from within by rst-person perception.

With the exception of, say, a frozen lake, few surfaces in nature are perfectly smooth, uniformly flat, absolutely horizontal, and capable of supporting the weight of the human body.

You can glean additional insight about your neuromuscular organization by noting any dierences in how your left and right sides contact the floor, usingakindofcomparativeanalysisofembodiedphenomenawhereintheflooractslike akinaesthetic mirror [Wildman 2008, p.64].

In this section, we discern devices which are developed to be- come an inseparable part of the human body like Dag's tail or a pair of glasses, oering new possibilities and improving or enhancing perceptual-motor skills. Such devices are also de- veloped for challenged people extending or even replacing parts of their body. For example, Music-touchShoesweredevelopedtosupporthearinghandicappeddancerstofeeltherhythm andtempoofmusicthroughthevibrotactileinteractionintheirdancingshoes[Yaoetal.2010] orthosis developed to support people's work (see Figure 6.7top right) [Flechtner etal. 2020].

For example, we transpire / sweat which increases with intensied physical activity.

Tangibles can also explore new perspectives regarding our skills and perception of our skills. For example, Danielle Wilde [Wilde 2010] developed a variety of body-worn artefacts in her Swing That Thingproject,whichaimatextendingthebodygesturally,mechanicallyandsensorially,thus encouragingpeopletomoveinpoetic,expressiveandevenextra-normalways,allowingthem toperceiveandusetheirbodiesfromnewperspectives.Forexample,hipDisk(seeFigure 6.7 bottom) extends the body horizontally by playing simple sounds in relation to movements of the hipsand torso. Extending the body does not only happen from the outside but can also be obtained from within. Moving towards cyborg relations, technology can also extend our body in new ways that oer us completely new possibilities. Stelarc explores already for many decades what it means to haveextralimbslikea third arm[Tofts 2008](see Web Companion6.1). Nowadays we see experiments with various computer chips and sensors in the body for non-medicalpurposes,e.g.toaccesspublictransport[Heernanetal.2016].Orgamedevices developed in the Exertion Games Lab [Mueller et al. 2020] which explore bodily integrated play, such as the Guts Game [Li et al. 2017], where people swallow a sensor to measure the bodilytemperature, whichis theinterfacefor thegame.

The second is centred around hermeneutical relationships, where technology needs to be interpreted by people inorderto make sense(see Figure 6.8).

For example, in chapter 1 we already showed that URP [UnderkoerandIshii1999b]supportstheurbanplanningprocessbyvisualisinganticipated shadows of architectural buildings on the Sensetable [Patten et al. 2001], and making these concepts easily physically accessible and manipulable. Over the years, the Tangible Media groupofHiroshiIshiidevelopedmanyartefactstorealisehisvisionofRadicalAtoms.Through his vision and related devices, he and his team aim to tap into the embodied skills of people, byincorporatingthedigitalintothephysical.Forexample,InForm[Follmeretal.2013b]was one of the rst steps to allow a person to manipulate physical objects at a distance, and with TransForm[Ishiietal.2015b]heandhisteamrenethemanipulabilityofinteractivephysical material(see Figuressection1.3.4). Examplesofartefactsthatallowsforexplorationwhilemovingthroughspacehavealready been introduced in chapter 3, such as Hydroscope (see Figure 3.14), which enables access to the digital realm through the physical, in this case by allowing children to explore a virtual ocean by moving the big object through space as a mediator between the kids and the virtual ocean [Dindler et al. 2007]. When looking at a bigger urban scale, we have several ways of accessingtheworldthroughourperceptual-motorskills.Forexample,iFloorisaninteractive floor that stimulates interaction with the build environment, in this case developed for multi- userinteraction in alibrary context. Dueto their urbanperspective towards interactive floors, there emerges a completely dierent relationship with computers as is often the case, onere view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.2 V Figure 6.9 Top:Foxelsaresmart,modularfurniturebuildingblocksthatallowownerstocustomizetheir owninteractivefurniture[Pertenederetal.2020].Bottom:StationofBeingisaninnovativebus stopwithasmartroofthatgentlyalertspassengersofapproachingbuses,androtationalshelter pods mounted from the ceiling allowing people to lean comfortably and protect themselves from the wind[RISE andFrieling 2019](photograph: SamuelPettersson) that is incorporating lth, rough use and straightforward cleaning with brushes, which is possible due to the projection technology [Krogh et al. 2004; Petersen et al. 2005]. More architectural examples are Foxels [Perteneder et al. 2020] and Station of Being [RISE and Frieling 2019]. Foxels (see Figure 6.9top) is a modular smart furniture system developed by the Media Interaction Lab in Austria, existing of dierent individual snappable building blocks, which support users to create their own preferred interactive furniture with dierent kinds of functionality [Perteneder et al. 2020]. Station of Being (see Figure 6.9bottom) is a bus stop in Ume\u00e5 that is designed by studio Rombout Frieling Lab and Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE) to transform the waiting experience of people in an often cold and snowyre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution216Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI Sweden. The bus stop uses embodiment to elicit a moment of mindfulness, by supporting people to lean against the hanging cocoons and swing themselves. A light and soundscape makespeople gently aware thatthebusis arriving [RISEand Frieling2019]. Hermeneutics forAccessing(un)graspableMatter Next to extending the body and having, e.g., programmable materials to physically interact with, there are many examples of tangible and embodied interaction that focus specically on extending the mind (which does not imply that other artefacts do not interweave mind and bodyand(implicitly)extendthemind).Aswealreadyexplainedinchapter4,whendiscussing distributed cognition [Hutchins 1996], the representation as well as the computation of infor- mation is distributed between brain and the environment. So, people represent information in theworld,andtheyusetheworldtoreasonwithitandtoreducecognitiveload[Kirsch2010]. Thiscanbedoneinvariousways,bymakinguseofthesituatednessandenvironmenttostruc- tureouractivities,forexample,byputtingourkeysclosetothedoorenablingustoreduceour cognitive load. Combining embodied relations with hermeneutic relations seems a fruitful and often ex- plored road within the TEI community. Starting from the early days, TEI has been strong in supporting people in embodied and expressive access to and interpretation of data and in- formation. Take for example, the many tools that have been developed to teach children and adults to understand and develop competencies in math, data and computing, and to program without needing to have extensive competencies. For example, the rst conference of TEI in 2007 presented two tangible languages to support school children [Horn and Jacob 2007d]: Quetzal for controlling LEGO MindstormsTM robots (see Figure 6.10top left) and Tern for controlling virtual robots on computer screens (see Figure 6.10top right). Chapter 2 \"TEI In The Wild\" discusses several tangible programming tools which can be found commercially, likeLittle Bitselectronictoolkit(Little Bits)and KIBO robotic platform [kin]. Tangibleinteractionisalsousedformanyotherformsofintangiblesandabstractconcepts. Closely related to these software and programming tools, are interfaces that support data visualisation and manipulation, such as Tangible Query Interfaces (see Figure 6.10second rowright)whichoerphysicalwheels,torepresentandmanipulatequeryparameters[Ullmer et al. 2005b]. Nowadays, interactive touchpads with small tokens and interaction tools allow forphysicalmanipulationofdata.Forexample,CoDa(seeFigure 6.10secondrowleft)gives studentsthepossibilitytoexploreanddiscusstheconsequencesofstatisticalndings[Veldhuis et al. 2020]. Other media that are used for tangible manipulation of its various characteristics are, e.g., music and video, with well-known devices like AudioPad [Patten et al. 2006] (see Figure6.10third row left) and Tangible Video Editor [Zigelbaum et al. 2007a] (see Figure 6.10third row right). A canonical tangible interaction example that makes intangible voice messages graspable is the Marble Answering Machine from Durrel Bishop [1992], which is shown in chapter 1 (see Figure 1.7 and 1.7). This tangible interface enables storing of andre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.2 V ariety ofPossibilities, Invitations andAppropriationof TEI 217 listening to voice messages, where the marbles both represent the message and act as the control tointeractwith themessage. Finally,tangibleinteractioncanalsobeusedtoexpress,visualiseandinteractwithcomplex movements, for example movements of tango dancers which are solidied through MoCap Tango [Peeters et al. 2016] (see Figure 6.10bottom). Their tango visualisations have various forms and instances, some being expressed real-time on a screen as a background for the dancers, whereas othertraces have been 3Dprintedas solidiedmovements. Catego ry 3: Sp eci c F o rms of Interaction with the W o rld DuringourTEIliteraturesearch,wefoundsseveralspecicformsofinteractionwiththeworld, of which we elucidate three in this section. Firstly, there has been a strong and continuous exploration, experimentation and development of various shape changing interfaces and pro- grammable materials over the last few years. Secondly, we like to give a bit more attention to poetical, magical and extraordinary interaction. TEI has always been a very diverse com- munity, where next to developing straight-forward functional technologies, people have been questioning the role and form of human-technology-world relationships through art and de- sign. ChangingInterfaces, ProgrammableMaterials Overthelastfewyears,weseethattheinteractivetechnologicalmediationsthataredesigned to allow people accessing the world around them, are not only making use of screens like URP or the iFloor, but they are getting more and more physically dynamic, like TransForm [Ishiietal.2015b]whichwehavediscussedinchapter1.Theseshapechanginginterfacesand programmable materialscome inall sorts andsizes. For example, Kas Oosterhuis explored with his architectural design rm ONL and his former Hyperbody Research Group at TU Delft, many buildings, facades and interiors based on Pro-active Architecture (ProA) (see Figure 6.12top left). These ProA spaces make use of real-time actuated architectural customized components, allowing for interactions that adjust themselvesto thesituations [Oosterhuis andBiloria 2008]. On a slightly small scale, the Co-motion bench (see Figure 6.12top right) uses shape changingtostimulatecasualinteractionandmeetingsinapublicspace[Gr\u00f6nvalletal.2014a; Kinch et al. 2014b]. The LiftTiles [Suzuki an easily adaptable room- scaleinteriorusingmodularinflatableactuatorsasbuildingblocksthatcanchangetheirheight from15cmto150cm,thusbeingabletoquicklyadapttoapreferredsituation(seeFigure 6.12 bottom). Even smaller, we discern directions of shape-changing interfaces, from 6.10 Using hermeneutics and embodied cognition to interact with abstract, complex or dicult to grasp matter, for example, a) Quetzal [Horn and 2006]. b) [Patten et 2006]. Tangible Video Editor et al. 2007a]. g) MoCap Tango [Peeters ariety (picturebyCaroline al. 2015] (see Figure 6.12middle right), to the already earlier shown Biologic [Yao et al. 2015a], which uses Natto cells as nano actuators to create aesthetically rened shape changing 6.7bottom). And we see shape- changinginterfacesfromeasilyprogrammabletoyslikeTopobo(seeFigure 6.12middleleft) which imitate an initial movement [Parkes and Ishii 2009; Rae et al. 2004] to physically dynamic and aesthetically rened artefacts such as Ripple Thermostat [van Oosterhout et al. 2018a] (see Figure 6.12bottom right). Finally, as an exploration to push the boundaries of shape changing materials, we also see attempts to move towards shape changing objects and services through swarms of miniaturised drones. GridDrones [Braley et al. 2018a] is one of the rst attempts to move towards programmable materials [Tooli and Margolus 1991] via very tinydrones. Poetical,Magical andExtraordinaryInteraction When describing in section 6.2.2 how tangible and embodied interaction can facilitate us to access the world through our perceptual-motor skills, we gave many examples of expressive, functionalinteractionstosupportpeopleineverydaylife,beitsupportoftheirbodyandbodily skills, functional and expressive, or a combination that also supports embodied cognition. In general, the examples given were focusing on interactions in our everyday life, where some focused on performing a task, while others were more about the experience, being in the moment and enjoying. Even though Station of Being (see Figure 6.9bottom) is protecting a person against the cold weather in Sweden in the wintertime, the aim of the design was waymorefocusedonthebeautyoftime,mindfulnessandappreciatingembodiedandsituated being inthe moment[RISE andFrieling 2019]. A part of the researchers within the TEI community are trying to explore and push the boundaries of interaction toward poetry, magic or the extraordinary. For example, Bert Bongers's installations Tangible Landscapes [Bongers 2020] are composed of a range of interactive audiovisual and sculptural pieces with a high level of engagement and poetry (seere view 2021-10-11 not for distribution220Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI Figure 6.12 A variety of shape changing interfaces and programmable materials, such as, a) The Muscle BodyasanexampleofPro-activeArchitecturethatisactuated[OosterhuisandBiloria2008]; b)coMotionbenchtostimulatecasualinteraction[Kinchetal.2014b];c)TheTopoboSystem isaprogrammablesetoftoys(courtesyMITMediaLab);d)DisplaySkinexploresthepotential ofabendablescreen[Burstynetal.2015];e)LiftTilesaimatanadaptableroom-scaleinterior [Suzuki et al. 2020]; expressive and aesthetic interaction [van Oosterhout et al. 2018a]re TEI 221 Figure 6.13 Poetical, magical or extraordinary interaction are pursued, e.g., by a) Tangible Landscapes: pumice floating with interactive video display [Bongers 2020] (photo Bert Bongers); b) TangibleScores[Tom\u00e1s2016];c)AerialTunes[Alr\u00f8eetal.2012];d)Pillow,raisingawareness of the part of Hertzian Tales (1994-97):[Dunne andGaver1997]. Figure 6.13 top left). They enable people to explore abstract landscapes of nature shown via movies, through interacting with found materials in nature like stones, leaves and musical instruments can be interpreted as scores. Another example, which is giving a magical feeling, is developed by Alr\u00f8e et al. [2012]. Their instal- lation called Aerial Tunes (see Figure 6.13bottom left) lets six white balls hover steadily in mid-air.Rasmussen [2013] describes how technology can create the impression of a magical interaction, based on the four types of magical casualties as described by Subbotsky [2010]: mind- over-matter magic, animation magic, non-permanence magic and sympathetic magic. Companies like Bang and Olufsen have always been fascinated by magical experiences, andre view not for distribution222Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI exploringthesebasedoningredientslikesurprise,theunordinary,theunnaturalortheexciting [de JonghHepworth 2007]. Although developed as a critical design, Pillow, created as part of Herzian Tales by Tony Dunne [2008] (see Figure 6.13bottom right), opens up a new imaginative, magical and until now invisible world which might evoke \"wonderment rather than shock\" Dunne and Gaver [1997]. Dunne's devices enable people to get access to perceptions of electromagnetic elds they could not have before. Pillow incorporates a manipulated LCD screen that responds to ambient electromagnetic radiation by showing changing light patterns, thus inviting people to reflect on and make sense of this radiation, including questioning topics such as privacy. Apartfromemphasisingaestheticsinsteadofmereusability,Pillowalsoraises \"deepquestions aboutthemeaningofdigitalmediaandinsuggestingalternativestoourcurrentassumptions\" [Dunne and Gaver 1997]. The latter addressed in category 6: socio- culturaldebate andspeculation. Peripheral PerceptionandInteraction Almost opposite to poetical, magical and extraordinary interaction is peripheral interaction. In most examples explained in the above sections is the interaction and device at the core of our focus when engaging with the world. However, the eld of TEI is strongly related to Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing, where computing technology is integrated in our everyday environment and routine, and is generally not at the core of our attention [Weiser 1991c]. In 1997, Weiser and Brown coined the term calm technology \"which engages both thecenterandtheperipheryofouraction,andinfactmovesbackandforthbetweenthetwo\" [Denning et al. 1997]. One of the rst canonical examples is Natalie Jeremijenko's Dangling string (described in Weiser and Brown [1996c]), a plastic string that is attached to an electric motor mounted to the ceiling. Whenever information passes the nearby Ethernet cable, the motorgivesatinytwitchcausingthestringto'dance'inrelationtothedatatrac.Morethan 10yearslaterin2006,thePowerAwareCord(seeFigure 6.14middleright),isdoingasimilar job for electricity, which next to functionally transporting electrical power, visualizes energy usageusingtheflow,intensityandpulsationoflight[Glynn2006; GustafssonandGyllensw\u00e4rd 2005]. Another example of peripheral visualisation is Sidetrack, a small round table displaying the movement pattern of a person working at home, when he or she moves from one space to another [Barcikowski et al. 2010] (see Figure 6.14middle left). A bigger ambient display taking up a whole room is Pinwheels (see Figure 6.14top), developed by Hiroshi Ishii and his students to display ambient information such as stock market activity or natural wind movement, spinninglike awind ofbits [Ishiiet al.2001b].

Intheprevioussections,wesawseveralexamplesofdesignsthatusetheirphysicalqualities to facilitate and enhance social interaction, like URP and FireFlies. In the following sections, we discern a few specic relations and purposes that tap into the dierent aspects of social interaction. We start with an overall category of empowerment of people in their socio- culturalenvironment,followedbyexpressionofselfandgroups,andinteractionsthatstimulate collaboration and interaction with others, including large groups. We conclude this part with a last category that looks at stimulating socio-cultural interaction through art, debate and speculation. Catego ry 4: Emp o w ering and Exp ressing Ourselves in Our So cio-cultural Context In this section, we describe two types of relationships. The rst is centred around empower- ment of individuals in their socio-cultural environment and the second is centred around the expression of self and groups (see Figure 6.15). Empowering People People appropriate and use technology through which they access and constitute the world, andviceversa,theworldandtechnologyarealsoconstitutingus[Ihde1995; Rosenbergerand Verbeek 2015a]. For example, through nowadays technologies like GPS and the internet we can have access to (almost) the entire world 24x7. Simultaneously, this means that the world is pushing us towards this 24x7 digital-physical realm. It sometimes feels as if the world isre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.2 V ariety ofPossibilities, Invitations andAppropriationof TEI 225 expecting our availability 24x7. And in case people do not have the means or the skills to and embodied interactions can be used to empower people being themselves, creating their own meaningfulness, exploiting their own skills and cognition, and allowing them to interactwith peopleand aworld thatts theirbeing inthe world. For example, instead of seeing people on the autistic spectrum as challenged or handi- capped, Jelle van Dijk and his students [van Dijk and Hummels 2017] developed MyDay- Light, to enable them to life independently, support their competencies, values, and take on lifeaswellassupportingthemtointeractwiththeirsocialenvironment(seeFigure 6.16left).

For example, MyDayLight facilitates its user to invite his counsellorintohis house,who supports himtostructure hislife. LinguaBytes developed by Bart Hengeveld has a similar starting point towards multi- handicapped toddlers to support them in their self-condence and joy in life, for which language is an important ingredient (see Figure 6.16right). It is not just about learning to communicate and speak, also the way this is done is very important. LinguaBytes makes use of interactive stories and a large set of small representations, allowing the toddlers to learn language by making stories and doing assignments with help from their peers and teachers [Hengeveld et al. 2013a]. Both examples, MyDayLight and Linguabytes, show a deep understanding of their user group and were developed in close cooperation with their stakeholders in order to be able to reach empowerment on all levels, cognitively, perceptual- motor,emotionallyand socially.

Moreover, mainstream experimental psychology has a hard time diving into these matters because much of embodied interaction has to do with context andsituatedness,whichisdiculttoinvestigateinalaboratorysetting.Ibelieveexplor- ing and reflecting on the design of interactive technologies can be used as a method to complement traditional cognitive science and experimental psychology. In my work I havebeentryingtopinpointvariousscaoldingrolesthatinteractiveartifactsmaycome to play in everyday human sensemaking activities, by designing new interactive forms, togetherwithdiverseusergroups,forvariousconcreterealworldsettings.Inthepastyears I have focused on young autistic adults who are living semi-independently and wish to become more independent. Autistic people experience the world in a radically dierent way than do non-autistic people. Traditionally, assistivetechnology designed forautistic people has progressed from a medical, disability model, and it aims at training autistic children to adhere to majority social norms or to compensate for their 'decits'. Instead, my focus is on designing embodied technologies that enable autisticpeopleto develop a stronger grip on their own lives and make sense of their lifeworld, in a way that is bene- cial to them, and starting from their own, personal normativity. This may lead to tools and artifacts that would make little sense to non-autistic people, because they are de- signedtobecomeappropriatedintoafundamentallyautisticwayof'being-in-the-world'. My project aims to empower autistic people to be and develop themselves - over and against this largely non-autistic world they have to cope with - as well as to help non- autistic people, through the appreciation of these design projects, to understand autismre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution6.2 V ariety ofPossibilities, senseof theworld.

Jelle van Dijk is Assistant Professor at University of Twente, the Netherlands. After a master in cognitive science he did a PhD in Industrial Design.

Expressing Ourselves and Connected Socio-cultural Realms Weliveinaworldsurroundedbyothers.Technologyinallforms,fromlow-techtohightech, allows us to relate ourselves to others through our expression. For example, there is a long historyoffashionwhichallowspeopletoexpressthemselves.WithintheTEIcommunity,this expressive mode of textiles was brought to the interactive realm through so-called wearables. In the Wearable Senses (WS) lab at the TU/e in Eindhoven, they focus on designing close- to-the-body interactions, specically designs that incorporate wearable computing or smart textiles\"[Tomicoetal.2014].Partoftheirdesignsfocusoncategory1,sensingandextending the body, for example Vibe-ing that uses vibration therapy for self-care (see Figure 6.17top left, right dress). But a large part of their designs also supports people to be empowered and expressthemselves,like thesedesigns onthe left inFigure 6.17(topleft). Another example of one of the many designs in the worldwide eld of wearables that is designed to express oneself is Monarch (see Figure 6.17middle left). Monarch is a muscle- activated kinetic textile that can be both used to express oneself as well as feel as a visceral extension of self [Hartman et al. 2015]. Young Suk Lee explored the possibilities of an interactive wig called Thou and I to express oneself towards others [Lee 2018] (see Figure 6.17top right). Of course, we do not only express ourselves through wearables or our own body, but also through interactive jewelry and various other artefacts from small to large to expressourselvesand ofTEI When looking at dance, tangible and embodied interaction can also add an extra layer of expression.Forexample,NUVEprojectsavirtualdouble,allowingthedancertohaveadigital performanceandinteractwithhisowndigitalvirtualbody[MartinhoMouraetal.2010](see Figure6.17bottomleft). Technology does allow us to express ourselves as unique individuals, but also to stress our belonging to a social-cultural setting and community. For example, Wo.Defy refers to the suragette North Cantonese Chinese women of the late 19th and early 20th century, who used a dierent kind of hair-styling and dress to challenge the traditional marital status of women [Schiphorst et al. 2013] (see Figure 6.17middle). Wish Happiness is inspired by TibetanMahayanaBuddhism,aimingtoresearchritualinteractiontostimulatethecultivation ofcompassion[Mahetal.2020](seeFigure 6.17middleright).Finally,wealsoseeexamples of religious expression, like the interactive prayer nuts, which are a multimodal ensemble of interactive objects that trigger visual, aural, tactile, and olfactory interactions [Kwan Interaction Nexttoempoweringpeopleintheirsocialcontextandstimulatingthemtoexpressthemselves and their connected socio-cultural realm, we also see a large group of tangible and embodied interactions that stimulate social engagement and collaboration with others, including large groups. In this section, we address these relationships, referring to interaction with people as wellas animalsand nonhumanintelligententities (seeFigure 6.18). Interacting andCollaboratingwithPeopleand Beyond Throughout this book, you can spot many interactive tables, which are developed for collab- oration in various way, be it to discuss and explore urban planning like URP [Underkoer and Ishii 1999b], visualizing business supply chains with Sensetable [Patten et al. 2001], or creating music with Reactable from Jord\u00e0 et al.

Related exchange of experience is done by [Smeenk et al. 2018] with Into D'mentia, a tangible environmental simulator to let people experience subtle situations that are based on the everyday reality of people with dementia. [Pratte et al. 2021] give an overview of so- calledempathytools,whichenablesdevelopersanduserstobeplacedinsomeoneelse'sworld, as close as possible to that person's lived and felt experience, in order to evoke empathetic responses. Instead of feeling a connection and engagement with one person or a specic group of people, Stoel Kuenen focused in his PhD thesis \"Design and aesthetics of being together\" onphysicalengagementandconnectionwithmultiplepeople(uptolargegroups)atthesame time, e.g. using his designs Sliders 2018; Peeters et al. 2014] (see Figure6.19bottomright).Nexttocreatingthisfeltconnectionwithmultiplepeople,artefacts and spaces are also developed to strengthen collaboration. For example, The Blue Studio is an interactive space with interactive objects to support a multi-stakeholder team designing innovativeembodied propositions[Jaasma et al.2017a] (seeFigure 6.19middle right). Tangible and embodied interaction does not only enable us to connect to and collaborate with other persons, it can also be used to connect to other entities like animals or intelligent artefacts. For example, Hou et al. [2017a] developed the co-op game Human and Dog, which lets one of the players step into the perspective of a dog, thus exploring unequal communi- cation. Now that interactive devices and spaces move more and more towards intelligent and autonomousdevicesandspaces,itcansparkawholenewcategoryofdevicesthatenablepeo- ple to interact expressively with their smart environment. This will partly be done via shape changing interfaces that are an inseparable part of the smart device or environment, like the examples given earlier in that specic section. It might also imply that we will have separate tangible devices to communicate expressively with smart devices and environments.

Addressingsocio-culturalissues viaartand debate Whereas the previous section focused on empathising and collaborating with people, be it an individual or a group, tangible and embodied interaction can also explicitly question and explore socio-cultural issues. As of the start of this community and series of conferences, art has always played a prominent role in TEI. Several examples of social-cultural critique and debate, like Pillow Dunne[2008], have already been touched upon in the above-mentioned sections.Inthissection,wewillintroduceafewadditionalexamples.Forexample,attherst TEI conference in 2007, The Meatbook made quite an impression (see Figure 6.21top left). It is an interactive art installation where an animal heart was mechanically animated, thus provoking a visceral response of the person viewing or touching (depending on his courage) thatwasgeneratingbothrevulsionandfascination[Levisohnetal.2007].Meatbookexplores theboundariesofthematerialsusedfortangibleinteractionandbybringingananimalheartto lifeitsparksalsothediscussiononaposthumanarea.AlsoBalladeofWomen(seeFigure 6.21 top right and bottom) is an interactive art installation, although with a completely dierent scale and topic.

Speculative Design, Critical Design and Design Fiction A specic form of debating and criticizing society is done through speculative design and its relativessuchasmaterialspeculation,criticaldesignanddesignction,focusingondesigning future interactions to question our current and future realms. For many decades, speculative andctionalapproacheshavebeenusedtoexplorehuman-computerinteraction.Forexample, usingpersonasisdeeplyinterwoveninauser-centredapproachafter Cooper[2004]introduced the concept to describe ctitious users. And also the use of scenarios is widespread in our community for many decades [Carroll 1997; Young and Barnard 1986]. For many years, the HCIcommunityfocusedonctionalscenario,conceptandstory-basedfutures,wheredesign ctions can be regarded as representations of futures from science ction that are captured in design scenarios specifying people, practice and technology in this future [Bell and Dourishre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution234Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI 2007]. The artifacts developed in these design ctions are generally references, props or non- functioningprototypes,which Kirby[2010]alsoreferstoasdiegeticprototype,i.e.,anartefact that only exists and functions in that future ctive world. For example, Leonardo Bonanni created with Hiroshi Ishii and his team the scenario of Perfect Red, a shape-memory clay to givesubstancetotheRadicalAtomsvision[Ishiietal.2012c](seeFigure ??topleft).Cheung and Antle [2020] studied to these scenarios and more prop-like prototypes, there have been several designers and researchers that created speculative working artifacts, with the purpose to include people in the critical debate via objects displayed in, e.g. museums and exhibitions. For example, Dunne and Raby introduced the concept of physical ctions and developed many prototypes todebatee.g.actionalfuturefortheUnitedKingdom,calledUnitedMicroKingdoms[Dunne and Raby 2013a] (see Figure ??bottom left). Over the last years, we see a rise in more speculative approaches that are still future-oriented but which create and use actual working artefactstobeusedinthehereandnowtocriticallyquestionourassumptionsregardingdesign andtechnology[Wakkaryetal.2015a].Thesespeculativeandcriticaldesignapproachesaim at exploring and questioning possible, plausible, probable, and preferable futures [Hancock and Bezold 1994] by making them experienceable, so-called material speculation [Wakkary et al. 2015a].

Havingatbetweenthevaluespeoplehaveorpursueandthevaluesaddressedandsupported while interacting with a new tangible or embodied device, can increase the success of the device. Schwartz [2017] developed over the last 25 yearshis rened theory of basicvalues, which can support designers to tune their type of interactions. Schwartz discerns 19 values, which are classied in dierent sections. In general Schwartz sees two dichotomies, anxiety-free peoplewhovaluegrowth(AF)andanxiety-avoidancepeoplewhovalueself-protection(AA). Moreover, people can be more personal focused (PF) or social focused (SF). Within these boundaries, he discerns four main categories which contain the 19 dierent values 2017]: 1.Peoplevaluingopenness tochange(AF, PF): Self-direction, i.e, Thought and Action: freedom to determine one's own thoughts and actions Stimulation: Seeking for excitement,originality, andchangein life withsensuous fullment 2.Self-transcendence (AF,SF): Benevolence,i.e,DependabilityandCaring:Beingaresponsibleandreliablemem- ber of the community, committed the wellbeing and welfare of other community members Universalism, i.e, Tolerance, Concern and Nature: Understanding and accepting otherswhodierfromus,beingdedicatedtoequality,fairnessandprotectingothers and nature. Humility: Acknowledging in theworld insignicance othersand theworld. Security, i.e, Personal and Societal: Ensuring safety and stability in one's personal life as well asin societyas awhole. Conformity, i.e, Rules and Interpersonal: Obeying rules, regulations and formal obligations, and avoiding to distressing orharmingothers.

Power,i.e,DominanceandResources:Havingcontroloverothersandoversituations via materials and social resources. Achievement: realising successaccording to socialstandards. Hedonism: pursuing a pleasurable life withsensuous fullment. Whenlookingatexamplesoftangibleandembodiedinteraction,somevalueslikehedonism and stimulation seem to have been upgraded to application areas, in this case gaming and playful interaction, such as the Swallow example [Mueller et al. 2020] that was discussed earlier. Many other researchers have been inspired to develop devices to support specic values, as also shown in section 6.2. The tradition of prayer nuts has for example been captivatedandenhancedviavaluessuchastraditionandperhapshumility[Kwanetal.2016] (see Figure 6.17). Security has been addressed in many dierent ways such as keeping one's body safe with, for example, the wearable soft robotic orthosis [Flechtner et al. 2020] (see Figure 6.7). But values can also be a starting point for designing everyday tangible and embodied interactions with a specic flavour. Even more so, technology is never neutral and always expressingandevokingcertainvalueswhilereducingothers.Intheprevioussections,wehave seenmanyexamplesofdesignsevokingcertainvalueswhilereducingothers.Forexampleboth Feather, Scent and Shaker [Strong and 1997a]stimulateconnectionandclosenesstoanotherperson,capturedbestbyBenevolencein Schwartz'soverview(forbothseeFigure 6.19).However,thewaytheydothisisquitedierent. Whereas Feather, Scent and Shaker seem to oer expressive diversity through hedonism and stimulation, InTouch seems more introvertedly focusing r, Cognitive, Emotional and So cial Skills When designing tangible and embodied interaction it is important to be aware of the full spectrum of skills people have in order to enlarge the design space. Overbeeke et al. [2004] andStienstra [2016] consider four types of skills when skills, also addressed by others as sensorimotor skills, refer to our skills of sensingtheenvironmentlikeseeing,hearingandsmelling,aswellasmovingandactingwithin the environment, suchas moving, touching andmaking sound. Tangibleandembodiedinteractionhavebeenpredominantlyfocusingontouch,movement, kinesthetics, vision and audio, as most examples in this book show. Often these senses seem to be taken for granted, and it is not often elucidated why a specic sense modality would be the bestwayfor givingfeedback. However, there are a few exceptions, especially researched by Obrist et al. They wrote several papers on less or rarely often used sense modalities in human-computer interactions, morespecicallysmell[Obristetal.2014b],taste[Obristetal.2014a]andtactilityandtouch, including temperature, surfaces andpressure[Obrist et al.2013]. Tangible and embodied interaction often make use of the combination of dierent sense modalities, also called multi-sensorial design [Schierstein and Spence 2008]. The phe- nomenon of synaesthetic experiences might be helpful to rene and strengthen these com- binations. Synaesthesia is combining several sense modalities, such as seeing colours when hearing music, or seeing form and movement when smelling a certain odour. For example, [Hummels et al. 2007] found in an experiment a strong link between odour, form and move- ment,operationalizedbylettingdesignersanddancersgesture/danceexpressiveshapesbased ondierentscents,andthereupon,havinganillustrator/designersketchobjectsbasedonblack and white movies of these gestures and dances (see Figure 6.23). In a matching experiment, participants were signicantly able to correctly map the dierent stimuli. Moreover, the re- semblances between movements, forms and scents were remarkable, and clear expressive groupswerediscernible. Although most people do not have an absolute relation to synaesthesia, the principle does help in developing multi-sensorial devices and has been used for multiple tangible and embodiedinteractions.Forexample,hipDisk[Wilde2012]makesaconnectionbetweenbody gesturesandsounds(seeFigure 6.7bottom).SoLuhyperinstrument,designedby3ktamakes multisensorialcompositionsbasedonthecombinationoflightandsounds[MacedoandSiegel al. 2012] is developed to use touch-based gestures to get a rich multi sensorial experience (see Figure 6.24top right). And Sensory VR tries to enhance the users experience by letting them stand on dierent textures such as sand or grass[Harleyet al.2018] (seeFigure 6.24bottom).

All three drawings of sculptures are highly similar with respect to shape and colour. This is all the more striking, because the illustrator/designer worked with black and white movies [Hummels et al. 2007].

It supports people to express themselves. The expression \"being moved\" shows the strong link between emotional skills and movement, stressing another potential strengthof tangible andembodied interaction. Therearedozensofemotionspeoplecanhaveandfeel,andseveralframeworksandmodels explain the possibilities and relationships, such as Plutchik's wheel of emotions [Plutchik 2003], showing 8 primary emotions, i.e., joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation. Or the 'circumplex model' of aect from Russell[1980], which is based on two dimensions: valence and arousal. These dimensions connect strongly to Osgood's factors of semantic meaning [Osgood et al. 1957], more specically evaluation and activity. Valence / evaluation are linked to human judgement and correlating with pleasant - unpleasant, good - bad, and beautiful - ugly. The second dimension, arousal, relates to variables concerned with quickness, warmth, excitement, agitation and such like, e.g., active - passive, but also fast - slow andhot -cold. When looking at tangible and embodied interaction, the artefact as such (the appearance, the quality, the cultural associations etc.) can evoke certain emotions, the direct interaction with the artefact can evoke emotions, and also the context can trigger certain emotions, e.g., bybystanders.Alltheseformsofemotionscanbeevokedwhenlookingattheexamplesgiven in this book, ranging from artefacts that spark excitement, evoke quiet pleasantness when interacting, or even evoke melancholy or sadness. Tangible and embodied interaction can howeveralsobebaseduponemotionalskills,e.g.byusinginteractiveartifactsthatcanmeasure emotions and respond accordingly, or by expressing emotions through its dynamic form.

In distributed cognition, both processing and representing information are distributed over the brain and the environment [Hutchins1996].Inconcreteterms,thismeansthatpeopleactivelyreasonwiththeinformation in the environment, and not merely represent information in the world. Making a shopping list, doing a calculation on a piece of paper, or putting the keys next to the door in order not to forget them are all forms of distributed cognition. Within the realm of tangible and embodied interaction, we already showed quite a few examples in the section discussing hermeneutics and embodied cognition to interact with abstract, complex or dicult to grasp matter (see Figure 6.10). Another example is explored by Konkel et al. [2019], who research how tangibles and display-rich interfaces can be used to support co-located and distributed genomics collaboration, a process that is very complex, requiring a high level of cognitive skills andwhich canbenet fromdistributed cognitionusing TEI(see Figure 6.26). Social Skills Last, but certainlynot least, people also rely on social skills to engage with others, to interact with them, to disagree with them, to cry and laugh together, and to learn from and with them. When Dourish[2001c] coined the term embodied interaction he referred to products, objects, conversations, actions etc. that unfold in a meaningful social as well as physical world.\"The ways in which we experience the world are through directly interacting with it, and that we act in the world by exploring the opportunities for action that it provides to us - whether through its physical conguration, or through socially constructed meanings.

Body as anatomy and physiology, i.e., the organic body referring to e.g. our skeleton, our muscles, our respiratory system etc., which can be supported through tangible and embodied interaction, but which can also be measured and taken as a starting point for interaction. 2. Body as expression, connected to concepts such as creativity, evolving processes and transformation, where the body is continuously showing to others what we do and how we feel, e.g. e.g. a feeling of stress through our posture, ddling with our ngers and a blush onour cheeks.Disciplines likedance buildupon thiscapability ofthe body. 3.

Designing Devices to Evok e A esthetics of Interaction Many books have been written about design and aesthetics, and we do not want to redo them here.

Prop erties of Artefacts How to create the form of and interaction with artefacts so that they are understandable and usable? Formgiving is the discipline that focuses at the appearance of and interaction with artefacts, focusing on e.g. ergonomics, functionality and expression, including non-obvious informationwhichallowuserstoperceivee.g.whattheartefactisfor,howitcanbeused,how sturdy it is, which emotions it targets at, what socioeconomic community is it designed for [Smets et al.1994]. Formgiving is an important aspect when designing tangible and embodied interaction. Today, the world of human computer interaction (including TEI), and the world of indus- trial/interaction design are heavily interwoven, but that has not always been the case. After the fties, when Modernism decreased and slowly but certainly faded out in the Western world,andunifyingideologiesweredisappearing,designwaspushedtobeautifulappearances \"packaging\", missing the electronic and digital boat [Overbeeke and Hummels 2013b]. The development of interaction with the \"ungraspable\" was divided between the Human Com- puter Interaction (HCI) community doing the engineering and interaction thinking, and the Industrial Design (ID) community beautify the new machines and interaction [Frens 2006; Overbeeke and Hummels 2013b]. The emphasis of the artefact and interfaces was placed on 'cognitive' interaction with displays and dozens of neatly organised buttons. As a response, thepost-modernistmovementIlNuovoDesign,startedpromotingprinciplessuchasdiversity, ornaments, colour and experience, and products like Swatch watches and Apple's colourful iMac were heavily influenced by this movement [Horn 1985]. Over the years the worlds of HCIandIDintegrated,leadingalsotoemergingeldslikeInteractionDesign.Ascanbeseen in theTEI community, manydierent disciplinescontinuouslycollaborate nowadays. When looking at the aesthetics of appearance and interaction, this collaboration of disci- plines is necessary to integrate product behaviour, software code and the topic of this section productappearance[BaskingerandGross2010].Insection6.5,we'llelucidateseveraldesign principlesrelated to form anddimensions. Design elements like material and texture are also strong mechanisms within formgiving. We see various studies on materials surface within the TEI community. Only recently, Hayes and Hogan [2020] presented at TEI'20 the type of materials used for tangible and embodied interaction, as reported upon during the last 12 TEI conferences from 2008 till 2019.

Eort is described in weight, space,time andflow. \"Shape\": also relates to the expressive aspects of the movement and the attitude of the person moving, but in this case to the spatial shaping of form, described in terms like growing, shrinkingor carving. \"Structural\" : describes the structural elements of the movement in full detail and mea- surable terms, e.g. the dierent body parts, the specicity of space regarding direction, distance, degree of motion etc., time aspects such as duration, as well as the quality of the dynamics.

(photo courtesy Sietske Klooster) movement as the embodiment of interaction. The framework facilitates the exploration of the relationship between product form, movement and semantics for interaction design. For example, when designing a new vase, the flower arrangement was the starting point for developing the choreography by Klooster, and the nal vase was the embodiment of this choreography, inviting the user to focus on the arrangement of flowers too (see Figure 6.33 middle). Bachelor students of Industrial Design, TU/e learned and used the framework in their project to design an interactive greeting ritual, starting from various ways of moving and greeting, thus developing a device to facilitate the choreography of greeting (see Figure 6.33right). Everydayrituals Instead of coming from the specics of (the choreography of) the movement, dynamics can also been approached from a wider spatial and temporal perspective, i.e., the perspective of an everyday ritual. The situatedness of everyday experiences results from the multiplicity of considerationsofartefactual,social,spatial,symbolic,performative... elements.Thecomplex spatial and temporal arrangement of these elements structure the experience. The design for everyday rituals focuses on creating such an arrangement in a way that not only the outcome, butalsotheexperienceitselfisharmonious,sothatitcreatesmeaningintheexperienceitself. Such design distinguishes itself from a more classic design aiming at a certain result (e.g., a coeemaker making a good coee) by integrating in the design consideration the way the resultcan bebeautifully obtained(e.g., anice way ofmaking a goodcoee).

First the utensils produced by the new production techniques were used in a night tea ceremony (yobanashi), during which candles are usually used to make light in the tearoom. Instead a discreet intelligent light system was mounted in the tearoom, controlled by a Kinect, so light would beautifully behaveaccording to the progressof theceremony. In the continuation of this work, L\u00e9vy [2018a] focused on the designing of every experi- ences. Based on an auto-ethnographical-like approach to making hot chocolate in a morning ritual (see Figure 6.35), he pointed out the complexity of designing with the aesthetics of the harmonyin mind,and pointedout variousaspects toconsider: Place and time: the coincidence of space and time (a ritual takes place at certain times in certain places) triggers the attention required for the ritual to be fully experienced as such. Essentialityofelements:theelementsinvolvedintheexperiencecanbeeitheressentialor contingent. Some elements, because of their functional nature (e.g., a cup to contain the hot chocolate) or their relational nature (e.g., the bowl with which I have learnt to make a \"proper\" tea) may be necessary for the ritual to experientially take place. Some other elements may be missing while the ritual can stillbe performed.re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution252Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI Figure The making of hotchocolate ina morning ritual(photo courtesy PierreL\u00e9vy) Strength of elements: often details of designs make a ritual more enjoyable (or simply more beautiful) than withoutsuch detail (e.g.,the qualityof thecoee grind). Design Principles As we explained in section 6.1., evoking a sense of beauty and aect during interaction can be done in various ways, e.g. using a semantic approach or a direct approach [Djajadiningrat et al. 2002a; Fishkin 2004]. Both approaches are based on dierent paradigms. Semantics is related to the cognitive science paradigm. This paradigm regards interaction as information processing,wheretheinformationinanartefactisprocessedintheuser'sbrainusinghislong- term and working memory [car]. Based on the user's goals and his subsequent intention to act, he executes a number of actions, which the user perceives, interprets and evaluates in comparison with his goals [Norman 1988b]. The direct approach is based on a paradigm that startsfrombeingintheworld[Merleau-Ponty1962],whereperceptionisnotapassiveactbut actively used to create meaning in interaction. As we could see in various examples in this book, the approaches are often combined, e.g. as Klooster and Overbeeke [2005] show and explainin theChoreographyof Interaction approach (seeFigure 6.33). Dierent paradigms, starting points and originating disciplines ask for dierent ways of designingandconsiderdierentdesignprinciplesvaluabletocreatevaluableaestheticdesigns. In the previous chapters, we showed already various frameworks and approaches to support designing tangible and embodied interaction. For example, [?] propose image schemas and metaphorical mappings as a framework for analyzing and designing tangible interfaces, as discussedinchapter4.Chapter3showsattheendanoverviewofmanyframeworksavailable to support abstracting, designing and building tangible and embodied interaction. In this section, we will elucidate three sets of design principles with concrete examples to support the design process and obtain aesthetic interaction. These three approaches do not attempt to be allencompassing, theymerelytry toprovideinspiration.re view 2021-10-11 not for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment,and Proximity,iswellknowninvisual anduserinterfacedesigncircles.Theheuristichasrelevancenotonlytothe visualappearance of tangibles, but also to their materialcomposition. Toward this, we briefly consider these in a TEI context. Longer elaborations of CRAP are available in print and online, e.g. Greenberg [2007];Renew[2016];Reynolds [2008] contrast: One denition of contrast is \"opposition or juxtaposition of dierent forms, lines, or colors in a work of art to intensify each element's properties and produce a more dynamic expressiveness\" [Dictionary]. This speaks to both aesthetic facets, basic legibility, as well as to the intentional eort to manage attention. For TEI, contrast has both visual dimensions: light and dark, wide and narrow, color amidst gray. Contrast in physical materials is also an important consideration: e.g., wood against metal, leather, fabric,stone,orglass.Withcontrast,neither moreorlessisinherently\"better.\"Excessive use of contrast can create competition for attention, potentially to disorienting eect. In some contexts - e.g., in attempts to engage visceral emotion - this can be desired; more often, it is not. Similarly, too little engagement of contrast can easily detract from legibility, or insuciently engage the attention of the target audience. Many issues of basic functionality also lie within. If a user cannot distinguish (e.g.) a functional from a non-functionalelement(e.g.,abutton,RFID/NFCsensingzone,etc.),itisdicultforher to engage. (Again, in some cases, this may be desirable, as with hidden or infrequently used elements). Although in CRAP contrast is generally related to visual contrast, the principle applies to all sensori-motor skills. When looking at developments like shape- changinginterfaces,aspectssuchascontrastbecomecrucialtodetectsubtledierencesin shape.Especiallygiventhatthedesignofsuchinterfacesisstillinitsinfancy,exploratory investigations towards a basic form language to obtain such subtleties can contribute to the eld. For example, Winther and Vallg\u00e5rda [2016] explore these aesthetics subtleties, including elementssuch ascontrast(see Figure 6.36). repetition: In the early days of desktop publishing and word processors, a common design \"mistake\" was the use of many dierent (and often disharmonious) fonts, colors, and/or layouts. The repetition element has a number of aspects. Visually, repetition can suggestuseofarelativelyfewfonts;commonheightsorwidthsofimages;etc.Physically, repetition can relate to consistency and reuse of physical interactors (knobs, tokens, etc.). Functionally, repetition also speaks to the computationally-mediated behavior of interactive elements - e.g., maintaining expectations of behavior in response to similar gestures or engagement with similar artifacts. Moreover, as the previous example in Figure6.36shows,repetitionscanalsobeusedasexpressiveandfunctionpowerinmore dynamics interaction, as also TRANSFORM, InFORM ((see Figure 1.16) and many ofre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution254Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI Figure [Winther and Vallg\u00e5rda 2016] the other shape-changing interfaces developed Ishii's team reveal [Ishii et al. 2015b]. alignment: Alignment concerns the relative placement of elements within a design, to- ward the creation of order and the fostering (per an upcoming term of extended interest) legibility. The position of each tangible exists in relative context with sister tangibles. Whether mechanically xtured (to the work space or each other), or in evolving physi- cal context of a game-board or other work surface, alignment stands as a key principle of visual and physical structure. The earlier shown design called Foxels (see Figure 6.9) even uses the principle of alignment as its basic starting point.

In this section we briefly describe the four elements. A more elaborate description of LAVA can be found in the appendix.

Actionable: Most of the TEI systems we have discussed engage computationally- mediated interaction: touching something, moving something, throwing something - in short, doing something. Talking about legibility, one can also ask how one can see and be invited to perform an action? What makes an artefact actionable and how to de-re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution256Chapter 6Aesthetics ofTEI sign for this? The previous examples expressing (in)accessibility and weight on those two dimensions, but there are many more aspects that determine if an artefact is ac- tionable. In section 6.1.1. we already introduced the direct approach and the concept of aordances. The Interaction Frogger Framework supports designers to get grip on actionability,throughdesigningandspecifyingfunctional,inherentandaugmentedfeed- forward and feedback [Stienstra et al. 2012; Wensveen et al. 2004b]. The framework includes six dimensions to create feedforward and feedback: time, location, direction, modality, dynamics and expression. Wensveen's alarm clock that was show in Figure 6.25was developedusing theFroggerFramework. Veritable: Do tangibles and the interaction with them provide means to ascertain the accuracy of represented content, and their interpretations thereof? For example, how accurate is the Pinwheels of and Ishii [1998a; 2001b], where the spinningofpinwheelswasascribedtothechangingstockmarketvalues(seeFigure 6.14). Before the day trader acts on such stimuli, one might do well to ask: am I sure what I think is represented corresponds with \"reality\"? And what happens if the purpose of an artefact is to confuse or distort the connection with reality, e.g. as evoked in the co-op game Humanand Dog[Hou et al.2017a]? Aspirational: Dotangiblesprovideaestheticmotivationtoengage,andsuggestpathsto- ward creating forms? Not all tangibles are equal in their potential to invite (or demand) engagement.Justasthepotentialsbetweenanill-conceivedandexecutedartbook,sculp- ture, or building dier profoundly from their aspirationally realized kin, the same is at least equally true for tangibles.

In this section, we briefly introduce his be- liefs/principles and illustrate them with some examples from tangible and embodied interac- tion.Formoreinformationandtheoreticalembedded,weadvisetoreadthechapter Industrial Design. Being in the world Design is about people. It is about our lives, our hopes and dreams, our loneliness and joy, our sense of beauty and justice, about the social and the good. It is about being in the world. As shown in section 6.2., artefacts are not merely a means to execute a function; they mediate our relationship with the world, with all its complexity and subtleties. They are not neutral and can resonate with our emotions, our dreams, our values. Based on Being intheworld theoriesandprinciples,PhilipRossdevelopedduringhisPhDtheintelligent lampAEI(shortforAestheticsandEthicsinInteraction),asaresearchvehicletoexplore how design can aect a person's value level (see Figure 6.38). AEI has three sets of behaviourdependingonthewaytheuserstokesthelamp,whichallthreetargetatevoking adierentvaluefromtheuserduringinteraction:feelinghelpful,havingsocialpowerand experiencingcreativity. Merleau-Ponty's, Dourish's and others' approaches to epistemol- ogy, we strongly believe that meaning cannot be detached from action. Meaning is in (inter)action.Thereis aprimacy ofembodiment. Tangible and embodied interaction are based on the same foundation, so nothing new for the readers of this book. One can only question oneself during the design process, how open a design can be in order to facilitate the creation of meaningful interaction. In section 6.2., we introduced the example of the Augmented Speed-skate Experience [Stienstra et al. 2011] as the ultimate example of meaning-creating in interaction, where 'meaning-free'whitenoisewasturnedintomeaningfulbodilyinformationbytheskaters duringaction,whichsupportedthemtoimprovetheirpostureandmovements(seeFigure 6.2). Reflection on action A design theory must be a theory of action and the embodied in the rst place, and of meaninginthesecond,andnottheotherwayround.Reflectiononactionisthesourceof knowledge. Theprimacyofactionimpliesthatcognitionfollowsperceptionthroughaction,including reflection. Sch\u00f6n [1983] as well as Dewey[1938] stress the importance of reflecting to let insights and understanding emerge from experience. Reflection in and on action is a powerful mechanism to learn and expand one's knowledge in and through action and doing, by entering into an experience without judgement and being surprised by one's reflections, thus opening up for learning from our actions [Sch\u00f6n 1983]. This principle invites the TEI developers to think through their hands, to develop prototypes early on, make their ideas experienceable, in order to reflect both in action during the making process, as well as after iterations to reflect e.g. with the users and stakeholders on the actions taken. The Studios, Workshops, Demos and Arts Exhibition during the TEI conferences embrace this notion of reflection in and on action together, and are highly adequateplaces forlearningthrough doing(see Figure 6.39). First / third person perspective The designerly way of looking is rooted in a 1st person perspective while intermittently takinga3rdpersonperspective.Consequently,designreliesonconnectingthesensorial, intuitive to the abstract,analytical. The interweaving of dierent points of view, including a rst, second and third person perspective, forms an essential part of phenomenology, where one's own point of view canneverbeexcluded.Therehavebeenvariousstudiesatthecross-sectionoftheoryand practice that explore the relationship between these dierent perspectives and switching between.

It is not only about the design as such and the values it might evoke, but also about a shift in attitude of the design team as well as of the \"user\". Together they can spark new behaviour to move towards a transformation.Inherthesis RightsthroughMaking-Skillsforpervasiveethics,Ambra Trotto [2011] explored how design can evoke people to act according the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For example, with Beehugged people can get power and rechargetheirmobilephonebyhuggingsomeoneelse[HummelsandL\u00e9vy2013; Trotto 2011] (see Figure 6.41left). And Jeroen Peeters [2017] explores in his PhD thesis how to design for aesthetic engagement, using skillful coping, intuition and reflection. He developed a multitude of prototypes to explore rich, open-ended and ambiguous ways of interaction, including the ones in the Rotation project: handheld objects without a practical function, so that it may only be interacted with for its own sake (see Figure 6.41right). Design methods The methods used must be rooted in design practice, in the socio-cultural and multi- culturalenvironment,invigoratedbyexperimentalandtechnologicalmethodsfromother disciplines. TEI is par excellence a multidisciplinary community (or even trans-disciplinary?), em- bracing the dierent perspectives, stakes, expertise, skills and contexts. One of the rea- sons for writing this book was the felt necessity to learn from each other, to share our knowledgeandskills,andbeinspiredbyeachother'sattitude.Thatalsoincludessharing and co-developing methods to develop tangible and embodied interactions.

Interweavingpracticeand research Design practice and design research are powerful generators of knowledge. They are a way of looking at the world and transforming it. Consequently, design teaching and researchshouldbe interwoven. This TEI book aims at a diverse audience, from students wanting to learn the ins and out by applying the ideas, to companies exploring and sharing the value of TEI for their business, to researchers from the various elds to connect their expertise and learn from each other through collaboration. The connection between practice and research as an approach within TEI seems naturally incorporated within the DNA of the community, basedontheprinciplesofreflectiononactionasweexplainedabove.Nexttothis,Chapter 2 shows many examples of TEI in the wild, commercialized through industry, or made robust through research, showing the potential of joining the dierent perspectives on practiceandresearch.However,weshouldkeeponpushingandexploringtheconnection between research and practice, due to what Bill Buxton [2008] calls the Long Nose of Innovation...

We showed through classications of potential human- technology-world relationships how to realise aesthetics in interaction, thereby addressing its scope, the person's abilities, values, skills and needs, as well as the richness of the artefact including its form, materials and dynamics qualities. We showed many examples to elucidate how to create meaningful interactions and how the richness and subtleties of materials and dynamics cant theskills andmodalities ofa person.

Chapter 2 also discussed how TEI can have real world impacts by surveying example interfaces that have been deployed \"in the wild\" in ar- eas of learning, social connectedness, and health and wellbeing. In doing this, we touched on the broad topic of evaluating TEI systems.

Note that these perspectives are not intended to be mutually exclusive, and researchers and designers may take on multiple lenses toconsider theevaluationof theirdesigns. User Interaction P ersp ective A central aspect of TEI design is that it introduces new techniques for interacting with computational systems. From a user interaction perspective, TEI designers might ask how successful a TEI system is (or how successful specic interaction techniques within a TEI systemare)withrespecttovariouscriteria.Forexample:Howeasyisthesystemtouse?How understandable are the interactions? How well does the system support the given tasks?

Also, given that TEI systems often introduce novel interaction techniques thatserveasacontrasttothedominantGUIparadigm,manystudieshavetakenacomparative approachinordertoinvestigatethecostsandbenetsofdierentinteractionstyles[Shaerand Hornecker 2010b].

In some cases, TEI studies also investigate the hedonic qualities of the interactive experience, such as aesthetics andenjoyment. To illustrate TEI evaluation from a user interaction perspective, we describe two example studies that cover a number of the approaches and instruments described above: a lab-based comparative study of TUI and GUI versions of the FlowBlocks modeling and simulation system [Zuckerman and Gal-Oz 2013] and an in-the-wild study of the usability and learning impacts of the Teegi educational support puppet [Fleck et al. 2018].

Asdescribedinchapter5,complementingthedevelopmentofspecicmediatingtechnolo- gies,therehasbeenasignicantamountofworkfocusedonthecreationoftoolkitstosupport the design and development of TEI systems. These include hardware-based toolkits such as Phidgets[GreenbergandFitchett2001b]andLilypadArduino[Buechleyetal.2008a],aswell as cross-device interaction toolkits [Brudy et al. 2019] such as the Responsive Objects, Sur- faces, and Spaces (ROSS) API [Wu et al. 2012] and the Society of Devices (SoD) Toolkit [Seyed et al. 2015]. As described by Ledo et al. [2018], the main strategies for evaluating toolkits are: 1) demonstrations that show what the toolkit can do, 2) studies of usage that as- sesshowdeveloperscanusethetoolkit,3)analysisoftechnicalperformancebasedoncertain benchmarks,and 4)inspection againsta set oftoolkit-centricheuristics. We illustrate TEI a technical perspective by describing three examples: theTViewsTable[Mazaleketal.2006; Reynoldsetal.2007]acoustic-basedtrackingsystem for interactive surfaces, floor-basedre view 2021-10-11 Figure 7.5 Left: GravitySpace [Br\u00e4nzel et al. 2013] is a pressure-sensing floor that can track people and furniture.

An optical tracking and display system can project graphics onto the levitated object, and users can interact by grabbing, rotating, and moving the object in the anti-gravity space. In order to evaluate ZeroN from a technical perspective, the researchers consideredanumberoffactorsandalsoreportedonthesystem'slimitations.Factorsincluded: themaximumrangeoflevitationwhichislimitedbytheheatgeneratedintheelectromagnet's coils, the system resolution which is limited by the lateral oscillation of the object, and the speed of actuation which limits how fast a user can move the object before it drops. Additionally, the researchers tested the robustness of magnetic levitation by experimentally measuring how much force can be applied to the object without displacing it from stable suspension (seeFigure 7.6). Arts P ersp ective The arts have played an important role in TEI from the outset. Indeed, the rst International Conference on Tangible, Embodied and Embodied Interaction in 2007 explicitly aimed to bringtogethermultipledisciplinaryperspectives,includingresearchers,designers,practition- ersandartists.By2011,theconferenceintroducedaseparateartstrackforthepresentationof Figure 7.7 Left: Architales [Mazalek et al. 2009] is a an interactive story table that was shown at the Listening Machines 2008 show at the Eyedrum Gallery in Atlanta, GA, USA.

When considering evaluation from an artistic perspective, we can look at how visitors experienceinteractiveartworksthatemployTEItechniques.Indeed,manyTEIartworkshave beenexhibitedinartgalleries,andinsomecasesthecreatorshaveobservedvisitorinteractions andgatheredfeedback,whichtheyhaveusedtoformulatelessonsthatcaninformfutureworks. This kind of informal evaluation can be seen in examples such as Architales [Mazalek et al. 2009]andThoughMilesApart[SungkajunandSeo2019](seeFigure 7.7).Inothercases,the artist-researchers(orinsomecasesresearchersworkingwithprofessionalartists)havestudied the creative process and/or the visitor experience of the created work in a more formal way. These studies typically use qualitative approaches such as ethnography, and data is collected through observations and interviews. However, the focus is not performance-oriented, and in contrast(orsometimesinaddition)tothequestionsofusabilityanduserpreferencedescribed above, the researchers might ask, for example, what motivations and intentions shaped the construction of the work, how closely the visitor interactions relate to the artist's motivations andintentionsforthework,orhowthevisitors'interactionsunfoldinapublicsetting.Morrison et al. [2007] draw on William Gaver's [2002] concept of designing for \"ludic\" engagement to describe these kinds of evaluations of interactive artworks, which prioritize pleasure over function, as well as subjective interpretation and ambiguity as positive values for the design ofinteractive experiences [Gaveretal.2004]. It is important to note that evaluation from an artistic perspective accounts not only for the way in which artworks are created and experienced, but also for the role these works play in supporting a critical examination of TEI as a medium [Tom\u00e1s 2017]. Indeed, numerous researchers have called for the integration of art criticism with HCI methods (see e.g., [H\u00f6\u00f6k et al. 2003; Morrison et al. 2007]) for evaluating engagement with interactive artworks. Tomas [2017] extends S\u00f8ren Pold's [2005] not for Figure Day of the Figurines [Benford et al. 2011] is a interactive performance and installation piece that uses a tabletop spectator interface to visualize an unfolding narrative over time. Right: tangible gurines are selected by participants to represent their characters on the spectator interface. the creation of TEI artwork can serve to critically reflect on accepted assumptions within HCI design, as well as to propose alternate models for evaluating the experiential aspects of interactive experiences. The goal is less about providing clear answers and functional solutions, and more aboutopening upnew questionsand dierent ways of seeing. We illustrate TEI evaluation from an artistic perspective by looking at two examples: an ethnographic study of the creation and experience of the Day of the Figurines interactive artwork [Benford et al. 2011] and the critical examination of the Tangible Scores expressive musical interface [Tom\u00e1s 2016, 2017; Tom\u00e1s and Kaltenbrunner 2014].

In keeping with the idea that TEI artworks can serve critical interfaces as described above [Pold 2005], the artist- researcher reflects on the way in which Tangible Scores question fundamental aspects of interface design in electronic music, such as the abundance of symbols and parameters that mustbelearned,andforegroundnewideas,suchasthewayusersmust\"thinkthemateriality\" [Tom\u00e1s 2017]. Additionally, he reflects on the work from the perspective of practice-based research, where the contributions to knowledge emerge through his own practice with the interface(e.g., concerts withthe work, composition). Philosophical P ersp ective TEI is rooted in theories of embodiment that focus on the study of human experience in the world, such as the branch of philosophy known of phenomenology that was founded by Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century, and further developed by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Alfred Schutz and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. While the central ideas of phenomenology are described in greater detail in Chapter 4, here we look at how philosophy can inform theevaluationof TEIsystems. Winograd and Flores [1986] were central in bringing ideas of phenomenology to HCI by drawing on Heidegger's concepts of ready-to-hand andpresent-at-hand to describe the way ourrelationship with objects changesin the eventof a breakdown. view 7Evaluating TEI Figure 7.10 Breeze [Con 2008] is a robotic live Japanese maple tree that can sense the presence and movement of people in its environment andrespondbymovingits limbs. ofHCIsystems,particularlythosethatemployTEIapproaches.Dourish[2001a],forexample, hasarguedthatphenomenologycanservetoframeourunderstandingofembodiedinteraction, particularly in the context of tangible and social computing. In related work, Svan\u00e6s [2013] has drawn on Merleau-Ponty's ideas about perception and the lived body to suggest several concepts that can be used in the analysis of interactive systems: the feel dimension of HCI, interaction gestalts, and kinaesthetic thinking. He notes that these ideas can be helpful in consideringthe\"feel\"ofuserexperiences,aswellastherolethatthekinaestheticsenseplays in the design of interactivesystems. Moving beyond phenomenology, another useful lens for the evaluation of TEI systems is that of postphenomenology, which is an empirically oriented philosophy of technology that focuses on concrete human experiences with technology [Ihde 1995; Rosenberger and Verbeek 2015b]. As such, postphenomenology provides a way to analyze the particularities of technologies and the ways in which they shape our day-to-day lives. A key analytical concept from postphenomenology that can be applied to TEI is the idea of \"multistability\" [Ihde2012; JensenandAagaard2018; VanderZwanetal.2020],whichpointstothemultiple possibleusesatechnologycanhaveindierentcontexts.Anotherimportantconceptisthatof mediation[JensenandAagaard2018],whichalludestotheagencyofaparticulartechnology. These concepts can be applied in the analysis of TEI systems in dierent ways. For example, Jensen and Aagaard [2018] apply the \"variational cross-examination\" approach developed by Rosenberger [2014] to TEI designs. The central idea of this approach is to identify and contrastthefeaturesofanartifact'smultiplestabilities.Inotherwork,Kiran[2015]describes four dimensions - the practical, the ontological, the epistemological, and the ethical - that can be used to characterize technological mediations. Some researchers also propose moving from an empirical approach to a more practical one, in which postphenomenological theories and methods are used to improve design outcomes [Eggink and Dorrestijn 2018; Van Belle etal.2019].Forexample,VanBelleetal.[2019]describeaPhilosophy-through-Design(PtD) processthatisguidedbyaphilosophicalresearchquestion.Questions,creationsandreflectionsre view coMotion [Gr\u00f6nvall et al. 2014b; Kinch et al. 2014a] is a bench that can change its shape in responseto thepeople whosit onit. inthePtDprocessinteractwitheachother,yieldingcontributionstophilosophyandtodesign by opening up new questions and perspectives rather than by nding answers. Also, Kiran's [2015] dimensions have been applied as a generative lens in design research and practice [Vander Zwan et al.2020]. We illustrate TEI evaluation from a philosophical perspective with two examples: the phenomenology-based interpretation of an interactive artwork called Breeze [Con 2008], and the postphenomenological analysis of the and Aagaard 2018;Kinchetal.2014a].Ourfocushereisonhowphilosophyinformedtheinterpretationof these works.

Using data gathered in Gr\u00f6nvall et al.'s [2014b] user study of the bench in three dierent locations, Jensen and Aagaard [2018] conducted a postphenomeno- logical analysis of the coMotion bench using cross-variational analysis. In doing this, they addressedthreefeaturesofthebench'smultiplestabilities:1)comportmentandhabits,2)role within a program, and 3) concrete tailoring.

I encountered a research eld that based itself on the same principles as I did in my own work: phenomenology and Gibson's theory of aordances. Moreover, I encountered a kind of methodological con- sistency that is sometimes missing in philosophy: if one takes seriously the idea that we arenotthinkingthings butthinkingwiththings,thenwhynotexplore,change,adaptand design these things? The TEI-community might think that reading Heidegger can make youabetterdesigner,butperhapsbeingagooddesignercanmakeyouabetter\"Heideg- gerean\" aswell. Perhaps then the contribution of TEI to philosophy is not a set of design artefacts in line with a particular philosophical view (this would be kind of boring). Instead, the contributionliesinmethods,inmaterialspeculationandinacontinuousconversationin which designers and philosophers can challenge and inspireeach other. Ithinksuchcross-fertilizationbetweenphilosophyanddesignhasbeenmostproduc- tive in the eld of postphenomenology [Verbeek 2005], where it has been used as a lens to analyse how a design mediates the experience of its users [Hauser et al. 2018a], and as a generative lens to inform the design process [Van der Zwan et al. 2020].

Our aspiration is to bring in diverse perspectives for TEI to foster healthier, sustainable and more fullling lives for individuals and communities by leveraging and augmenting humans and their environment to enhance creativity, productivity, collaboration, learning, imagination, inquiry, and connectedness. This will most certainly not be one-size-ts-all. On the contrary, our perspectives envision and engage a world that sometimes holds more graphical displays, and sometimes fewer; sometimes more human \"input,\" and sometimes less; sometimes \"more technology,\" sometimes less, with manifestations sometimes more in the background, and sometimes less. In some cases, the artifacts we have described take on forms relatively generic across cultures.

Considering the multi- and transdisciplinary perspective of TEI and its poten- tials for providing more intuitive, collaborative, and eective ways to people to interact with each other and the world in various domains, it is important to examine how TEI can address pressing societal problems through systems, technologies,tools, methods,and theories. Thecreationofnewmeaningfulinnovationsrequiresanunderstandingofchangingvalues and paradigms. One way of creating this understanding is by departing from the emerging present and pursuing anunderstanding (via weak signs1) of how value is changing for people and how socio-cultural paradigms are developing. Based on an understanding of our current changes, we might project towards things to come [Rocchi et al. 2018]. Developing various (research) prototypes, design probes and even speculative designs can initiate a debate about these values and paradigms, and explore how products and services could help people to achieve their future goals and aspirations [Dunne and Raby signs are \"internal or external signals that can alert an organization of potential threats and opportuni- ties\"[Dutton and et al.2018b]. of our bodies and the environment? Will we aim at doubling our life expectancy or even immortality? Will we aim at having sustainable prosperity and dignied living for all, and live in harmony with nature? Or will TEI die a slow death and will society embrace a post- biological,post-humanfuture,wherebiologyandthehumanbodyareseenasalimitingfactor, and intelligenceis seenas the main goal[Harari 2018; Kolkmanet al.2018]? We don't have the answers, although the latter scenario is not our preference. It is crucial that we all take an ethical stance when developing TEI. Or as Peter-Paul Verbeek Verbeek [2006b] says, thisinmind,wemusthavetheseethicaldebatesaboutthekindofdesignsandinteractionswe impacts they haveonsociety. Envisioning our society in 30-40 years is not the only way to address and explore this ethical stance. We are currently living in turbulent times, where the Covid-19 pandemic gave a completely new perspective on our society, our current values and paradigms, our patterns of behavior, our policies, etc. Suddenly our technology oered new ways of mediation, our social relationship with people changed, and the underlying embodiment principles of TEI where challenged by a 1.5 meter / 6 foot social distancing policy, as we also indicated in the summary.

Using Youtopia, children were invited to design their own world, exploring how dierent decisions about land-use impact the amount of food, housing and energy provided to the population, and the level of pollution in the environment. A predecessor of Youtopia, a tabletop game called Futura [Antle et al. 2011], was designed to engage the public with issues of sustainability. It was deployed in the 2010 VancouverWinterOlympics(Canada)demonstratingthatthegeneralpubliccandevelopbasic awarenessoutcomesaroundsustainabilityissuesthroughcollaborativeparticipationinplayful activities.

Ken Robinson \"I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, iscreatetheconditions underwhichtheywill begintoflourish.\" The TEI community has for many years explored these conditions by developing new tools for classrooms [Bakker 2013b; Verhaegh et al. 2013], for learning abstract concepts from subjects such as math and programming in a hands-on way [Andersen and Ward 2017; Girouard et al. and 2019; Horn 2007c; Mickelson and Ju 2011], for supporting full-body, multimodal and societal challenges such as accessibility and inclusiveness. While acknowledging the major progress that has been accomplished towards increasing access to education around the world, and in particular the growing enrolment of women and girlstoschools,theUNsustainabledevelopmentgoalscallfor\"boldereorts[that]areneeded to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals\" [Nations]. We believe that TEI researchers and practitioners could make important contributions to these eorts by fosteringlearningin diversepopulations acrossall levelsof education. In Chapter 2 we described the in-the-wild application of TEI tools for learning across a variety of content domains, then in Chapter 4 we discussed the cognitive foundations for supporting learning with TEI. In this chapter, we highlight projects that focus on providing qualityeducation tochildrenfromat-risk populations. The Mind-Full project [Antle et al. 2018] aims to help children from at-risk populations who suer from trauma and anxiety, to stay calm and focus on learning. To help children learnhowtoself-regulateanxietyandattention,theresearchershavedevelopedabrain-tabletre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution8.1 Deep engagement withsocietalchallengesand changingparadigms 295 application that engages children in the practice of meditation using neurofeedback, making invisiblebrainprocessesunderstandable forchildren. The project started in Pokhara, Nepal, where a development team, consisting of senior HCI researcher Alissa Antle and trauma therapist Leslie Chesick, worked closely with the NGO Nepal House Society Kaski, which funded and operated a school for young girls living in poverty. While the girls attended the school, many of them had diculty learning due to multiple traumas and anxiety. To address this problem, the team designed and built a brain- tablet game application so that the young students, who were often illiterate, could improve theirself-regulationofanxietyandattention.Theapplicationincludesthreegames(shownin Figure8.8,eachwithaculturally-relevantactivityfamiliartothechildrenfromtheireveryday lives. Two of the games were designed for relaxation and one for sustained attention. The games' input is the children's brain wave activity, measured by the commercially-available NeuroSkyheadset.Theapplicationalsoincludesamoduleforcalibration(showninFigure 8.8, which runs on a separate tablet and allows an adult to monitor the children's brain activity values. A eld trial using the application in Pokhara school showed that children were able to acquire self-regulation skills and transfer those skills into their learning and play activities. Positive eects were maintained for two months post-intervention. Based on these promising results, the team rened and extended Mind-Full by building three new versions (shown in Figure8.8), Mind-Full Wind (Nepal), Mind-Full Wild (Urban), and Mind-Full Sky (Aborig- inal)). They released beta versions of the new Mind-Full apps on the Google Play store and conductedadditionaleldstudieswithchildrenlivingwithtraumainanurbanenvironmentin Canada.Theyfoundsimilarresultsthatindicatedpositiveimpactandevidenceofimprovement on objectivemeasures. A dierent population of at-risk learners include children with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. Several TEI projects seek to help such children to acquire reading and language skills. For example, the PhonoBlocks system [Fan et al. 2017a] (shown in Figure 8.9), by Antleandherteam,consistsoftangiblelettersencodedwithvisualorhapticinformation.The research team has developed dynamic color and haptic coding strategies to enable reliable two-dimensional decoding, enforce correct letter orientation, and enable epistemic strategies that simplify spelling tasks. The system was designed for and evaluated with 7 to 8-year-old children at risk for dyslexia. Results from a eld study show promising results, indicating signicant gainsin reading andspelling. The LinguaBytes system [Hengeveld et al. 2013b] (shown in Figure 8.10), developed by Hengeveld and colleagues, aims to stimulate language development for non-verbal or hardly- speaking toddlers.

Most importantly, the various materials and ways of interaction were designed based on low- threshold physical manipulation, thus allowing children with motor disabilities to do similar things as \"normal\" children, helpingthem to raisetheir self-esteemand This applies beyond childrenfromat-riskpopulations.

Realize that testing prototypes with vulnerable user groups in the wild creates expec- tations.

The unprecedented challenges that we face nowadays, together with the speed of technological advancement, demand a new civilization. The skills that such civilization needs to have are not completely apparent yet. However, some of them have clearly emerged in the last decade. One is clearly the ability to withstand and navigate contemporary complexities; challenges that are dicult to frame, that escape linear laws of causality.

Societalchallengesemergeasglobal,theyrequiresystemicapproachestobeunderstood andtackled.Andthetackling,tobemeaningful,needstobesituatedinspeciccontexts. This leads to the necessity of a new, more elaborate and mature sense of responsi- bility, since it is becoming so clear how local actions have global repercussions. It has become clear how the ethically blind implementation of more or less intelligent digital technologies in all aspects of our life has ruthless consequences. This sense of responsi- bility can be trained in the form of ability to question, forecast, simulate and prototype what transformationsare triggeredbyour actions. Connectedness and the potential magnitude of our actions' repercussions, as well as the complexity of new challenges, require the integration of many dierent points of view: they require collaboration. People from dierent backgrounds, with dierent agendas,dierentprofessionalpractices,dierentcompetencesandskills,dierentways of thinking and acting are now requested to collaborate.

In Chapter 2, we highlighted TEI systems and approaches that foster learning in Biology. Here, we discuss TEI work focusing on modeling and visual- systems that demonstrate TEI approaches for supporting complex data and modelexplorationinclude: G-nome Surfer [Shaer 8.13) is a tabletop interface for browsing prokaryotic genomic data, designed to support teams of students participating in authentic scientic inquiries. Its design was motivated by the lack of bioinformatics tools that could support integrated workflow while facilitating collaboration, learning, and high- level reasoning [Bolchini et al. 2008; Mirel 2009]. The system utilizes multitouch interaction techniques with a visual genomic map. Users are able to explore genomic sequences through both coarse and ne navigation, while maintaining a sense of location. In addition, users canspatiallymanipulate,annotate,andcompareheterogeneousinformationartifacts.Beyond genome browsing, the system supports manipulating DNA through primer design, which involves the identication and testing of short sequences of DNA that mark the start and end of a particular region of DNA sequence.

The drawings are projected onto these microorganisms as light beams, which are sensed by the cells and cause the microorganisms to change their swimming motion. bioLogic [Yao et al. 2015b] (shown in Figure 8.17) is a project led by the Tangible Media Group at MIT Media Lab in collaboration with MIT Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Royal CollegeofArtandNewBalance,whichinvestigatestheuseofbacterialcellsaslivingsensors andactuators.Theteamproducedbio-hybridlmfromnattocells,whichexpandandcontract relativetochangesintheatmosphericmoisture.Thislmisassembledbyamicron-resolution bio-printing system and transformed into responsive fashion, a \"Second Skin,\" which reacts to body heat and sweat, causing flaps around heat zones to open and cool down the body.

TEI in the Age of Automation In his column in Interactions Magazine, Uday Gajendar argues \"we are living in an age of automation, where computational intelligence guided by algorithms in apps and sensors is woven into our daily lives\" [Gajendar 2019], and highlights the importance of considering the implications of automation for the humans experiencing such articial intelligence. We expect that while the involvement of computer-automated systems such as bots, cars, drones, and robots, in daily tasks will increase in the near future, rather than functioning in a fully autonomous manner, such systems will foster new forms of human-automation partnerships [Stoneetal.2016].Suchhuman-automationinteractionscouldhappenbothwhenhumansare co-locatedwithmachines(e.g.betweenadriverandtheirhighly-automatedvehicle)aswellas virtually(e.g.betweenanoperatorandarobotdeployedinaremotelocation).Achallengewe face is therefore, to design human-automation interactions, which are intuitive, and promotere view used more frequently in time-sensitive and safety-critical systems but that their use in embodied and situated systems, as well as by non-expert users is increasing. In their analysis, they discuss eight trends for future human-automation interaction research, distinguishing between themes that have been studied over the years (but continue to remain important), including: (1) function and task allocation between humans and automation, (2) trust,incorrectuse,andconfusion,and(3)focus,dividedattentionandattentionmanagement; andemergingtopicssuchas(4)theneedforinterdisciplinaryapproachesandteams,(5)regula- tionandexplainabilityofautomation,(6)ethicalandsocialdilemmas,(7)facilitatinghumane experiences,and (8)radicallydierent human-automation interaction. Considering the non-professional non-expert users andtheintegrationofautomationwithembodiedandsituatedsystems,weanticipatethatTEI willhaveanimportantroleinaddressingthechallengesforcreatingintuitive,humanistic,and eective human-automation partnerships. TEI research on human-automation interaction is still in early stages, and we anticipate that the above themes will inform future work in this area. Here,wehighlightthreeexploratoryprojectsthatdemonstratethepotentialofapplyingTEI approaches toshaping novelformsof human-automation partnerships. MetaArms [Saraiji et al. 2018], developed by a team of researchers from Keio University and the University of Tokyo, Japan, explores novel co-located collaboration between people and robotic body extensions (see Figure 8.18). The system consists of two wearable robotic armsandhandscontrolledbytheuserthroughfeetmotion-thearmsarecontrolledbymoving the feet, the robotic hands' griping is controlled through toes bending.

While the system is still is early exploratory phases, it introduces a new approach to control robotic limbs by remapping the user's limbs onto the articial robotic extensions,which opensa spacefor novel human-automation partnerships.

Associate Professor Andrew Kun, University of New Hampshire Tangible Interfaces in Automated Vehicles: Interactions in Our Near Future We are witnessing rapid progress in vehicle automation. Today's vehicles can assist the driver in a number of ways, including by recognizing speed limit signs and adapting the vehicle's speed accordingly, maintaining a desired speed without crashing into slower lead vehicles, and providing steering corrections to help maintain the vehicle within a lane.Yet,thedriverisstillincontrolofthedrivingtask,andtheautomationonlyprovides assistance. Soon however, we can expect vehicles to take over the entire driving task, but only under limited conditions. For example, automation might be able to fully control a vehicle in slow bumper-to-bumper trac on a divided highway. One exciting result of this progress of vehicle automation is that drivers will be able to engage in non-driving tasksduringtheirtrips.However,fortheforeseeablefuture,theywillonlybeabletodoso safely return to manualdriving.

Agenda for TEI Research What sensory cues are meaningful and eective for a positive human-automation The TEI conference was founded in 2007 and rst took place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It recognized, and was fascinated by, the range of multi-disciplinary perspectives on tangible interaction. Hence, the conference brought together a broad range of disciplines including arts,design,architecture,engineering,computerscience,psychologyandphilosophy.Tovalue and stress the merits from these dierent disciplines, the TEI conference took an avant-garde approach and embraced a large variety of forms including talks, posters, panels, debates, demonstrations, art works, performances, student competitions and workshops, where all submissionsweretreatedalikeduringreviewingandcouldbepublishedonthesamegrounds based on their specic merits. The form of the conference aimed at expressing respect to all disciplines, openness towards showing and sharing 'crazy' new idea, and stressing the possibility for mutual learning, be it on practical toolkits, insightful user studies, stunning engineering,aesthetic,poeticorevenshockingexperiences,anddeepphilosophicalquestions. Fourteen years later, we still see participants from dierent disciplines and a wide variety of output forms, however the underlying spirit of crazy, open, avant-garde exploration of boundariesseemstohavemadeplaceformoregeneralmultidisciplinarysharingandacademic rigor.So,whatisaTEIidentityandwhatwouldwelikeouridentitytobe?Areweacommunity that wants to question Cartesian philosophical perspectives on life, and explore embodied alternatives?

The current societal protests and debate on racism and equality, make us also reflect on the TEI community, our composition, our attitude and our designs. Are we too uniform, excluding specic communities and voices? Are we focusing too much on Western world perspectives, communities and technologies? Are we putting high level technology too much at the center, ignoring many potential rich contributions about embodiment and situatedness with slightly lower tech solutions, thus having an unintended selection mechanism? Is our attitudeopenenoughtoembracediversity?Whenlookingattheentriesofpapersubmissions at TEI conferences, we see a large variety of countries, but also continents that are not orre view 2021-10-11 not for distribution8.3 The socio-culturally embeddedTEI community 321 hardly participating. What would need to change in order to receive more submissions from, e.g., South America or Africa? Is our community diverse enough in terms of culture, race, gender, sexuality,disabilities,etc.? This year's TEI conference in Sydney, held just before the worldwide lock down due to COVID-19, seemed to have a predictive promising turn regarding equality and diversity, in variousways.Therewereseveralpresentationsshowingculture-basedtechnologies.Therewas a debate about the role of TEI regarding male-dominated healthcare technology, assessments and medicines, leaving the female body up till now fairly in the dark, for example regarding heartattacks,menstruationandmenopause.Andlastbutnotleast,theclosingkeynotespeech was given by Angie Abdilla, CEO of Old Ways New, who tapped into indigenous knowledge fromAustralianAboriginalpeople,thusdrawingupontensofthousandsofyearsofcultureand tacitknowledge,todevelopnewtechnologies,includingtangibleandembodiedinteraction.It shows the potential of the TEI community to address societal challenges from a diversity and equality perspective. It challenges us to explore and invite a diverse composition of people, have an attitude that is critical and reflective regarding our ethics and ways of working, and to develop designs which evoke respect and invite a large variety of people. This attitude and focus should in fact ts us like a glove. The very fundamentals of tangible and embodied interaction are supporting this view. Dourish[2001c] already emphasized the importance of embodiment and social situatedness, inviting people to create meaning in interaction, or as JaegherandPaolo [2007]coinedit:participatorysensemaking,wherethewholeismorethan Salzburg, Austria Reintegrating Studios into Conferences Theysayyouneverforgetyourrst-andIdon'tknowifthat'strueforeveryonewho attends TEI Conferences, but I remember my rst visit well.

And I believe I have seen glimpses of that old TEI spirit in person - the Arts & Performance track at TEI 2019 Tempe comes to mind, or the demo session of TEI 2016 Eindhoven. The spirit is notlost. This means we can work on getting it back. But what should itbe? It seems that our community is torn between two ideals: formalization and solutionism, versus artistry, aesthetics, and engineering. But can't the two exist together? TEI is a conference in a uniqueposition:asingle-trackconference,muchsmallerthan,forexample,CHIorUIST, but large enough that multiple trains of thought can exist.

In fact, we need to make space for the returnof this approach,again: forthe sakeof thefutureof ourcommunity. Sounds great, but how do we do this? I suggest we start small.

Inmyopinion,theStudiosareanexcellentapproachtobringbackandevolvethatold TEI spirit. But we need to get rid of the idea that Studios are somehow 'less than' paper or demo sessions, or that they should be embedded in theoretical workshops. Instead, the Studios should be viewed as an equal form of discourse: a conversation with the materials. The Studios are the prime opportunity to bring together engineers, artists, theorists, designers and philosophers in one room, and engage hands-on with the stu that Doroth\u00e9SmitisaPhDcandidateattheCenterforHuman-ComputerInteraction,Uni- obtained her Masters and Bachelors degree at the Faculty of Industrial Design in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

Summa ry In this chapter, which concludes the book, we shared our aspiration to bring in diverse per- spectives for TEI to foster healthier, sustainable and more fullling lives for individuals and communities by leveraging and augmenting humans and their environment. This chapter is a call-to-action for TEI practice, research, design, and development to engage with enhancing creativity, productivity, collaboration, learning, imagination, inquiry, and social connected- ness, while at the same time to consider ethical issues in design and apply responsibility. In particular, we highlightedthree directions toward fulllingsuch aspirations: Deepengagementwithsocietalchallenges-developingandapplyingnovelandestablished TEIsystems,technologies,tools,methods,approachesandtheoriesthatanticipateandexplore changing paradigms andthat addressgrand societal challenges.

Toprovidebriefcontextonthenatureandscopeofthepandemicasknownattimeofpress, on December 31, 2019, that the city of Wuhan, China, rst reported cases of a pneumonia of unknown cause to the World Health Organization (WHO). On March 11, 2020, as the numberofcasescontinuedtorisearoundtheworld,thedisease,thencalledcoronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic by the WHO. COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is transmitted through close contact, primarily by droplets generated by talking, coughing, and sneezing, and by touching contaminated surfaces. While people recoverfromthemilderformoftheillnesswithflu-likesymptoms,themoreseverecasescan cause respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and other serious complications, ultimately too often resulting in death [He et al. 2020]. By June 20, 2020, there were more than 8.5 million conrmed casesworldwide, withmore than455,000 deaths[WHO 2020]. TheCOVID-19pandemicraisesmanyquestionsaboutthefutureoftangibleandembodied interactions in a world where social distancing measures have been put in place across the globe, when it is unclear how soon we will return to our ordinary day-to-day lives, or what those lives may look like in the coming months and years. The vision of TEI is one in which computational media is embodied in physical objects, surfaces, and spaces that are touched and shared by many; one in which hands, bodies, and face-to-face collaboration are essential to the interactive experience. How does this reconcile with a world that has shifted largely to remotework;whereperson-to-personcontactandthesharingofphysicalthingsisbynecessity restricted? For the TEI research community, how will researchers conduct user studies? How will the broader community feel about encountering tangible systems in a post-pandemic world?Willpeoplestillfeelcomfortabletouchingsharedobjectsandsurfacesinpublicspaces, such as museums and galleries? These and related questions have been raised among the TEI conference steering committee and the broader TEI research community. Immersion within a global pandemic clearly has implications on the way we research and design tangible and embodied systems, on the way we teach tangible and embodied interaction courses, and 325re view 2021-10-11 not for distribution326Chapter 9Summary ultimately on the way everyday people experience tangible and embodied media - and all our interactions withand through computation,our world, andeach other.

By introducing contemporary \"maker\" practices [Browder et al. 2019] (e.g., rapid prototyping) to Indigenous communities, the project aims to increase pan- demic preparedness and resilience, as well as access to STEM training and technologies in these communities.

While these remain open questions, both in ordinary times and certainly while in a pandemic, from the broader scope of history, this is not the rst time that humanity has experienced a pandemic.

In the rst, Gaver explores the relationships between provided perceptual information - e.g., visible or haptic engagement with a tangible - and underlying technological aordances (e.g., in the actions evoked by engaging a screen-based or tangible artifact).

Gaver's illustration of A.24a also illustrates the notion of a \"false aordance.\" In a time of ubiquitous multitouch interaction, one common example is the presence of \"illuminated glass\" (a computationally-mediated graphical screen) as suggesting the capacity fortouch/multitouchinput.Forpeopleofeverydemographic(fromyoungestchildrentomost senior computing academics), incorrectly assuming the capacity for touch input, when it is absent,remainsverycommon-perhapspreciselyforlackofareliableperceptualaordance.

Factually, because a physical artifact that physically represent dierent associations (be they abstract data, or of people, places, or things) - by mainstream denitions, such artifacts would be regarded as tangible. One could easily argue whether data physicalizations are a superset, subset, or intersecting set relative to computationally- mediated TEI. In our present view, even for (e.g.) data physicalizations that are presently \"non-interactive,\" there lies considerable potential for considering as tangibles, holding rich potential for future interactivity. In some cases, this evolution might be accelerated through anticipatory integration of NFC tags, conductive elements, unlit LEDs, etc., as footholds toward future awakenings.

The Apple HIG was an iconic, trailblazing document, with catalytic impact toward accelerating graphical interfaces to ubiquity.

While there is an important underlying rationale, it is unclear whether TEI/Surface variations on spreadsheets - often regarded as the original \"killer app\" for personal computers - would be \"allowable\"under thisconstraint.

Related ideas include \"creative diuseprovenance:\"timing S curves can be applied within TEI at dierent levels of granularity.

In a variant by David Liddle (manager of the Xerox Star) in his \"Accounting for Electrical Engineers\" course, the axes were existing vs. new products (or product lines, as a broader conception); and existing vs. new industries. There, a \"danger of the two square move\" - attempting to simultaneously create both a new product (line) and a new industry - was warned as often fraught with peril.
