One area that should come under careful scrutiny is vaccine trials carried out in far away developing countries where both infectious diseases and corruption are endemic. Many scientists associated with such trials have a long tradition of publishing false and fabricated results in highly prestigious journals of the USA and the UK. These vaccine trials were carried out in countries which had very poor scientific infrastructure. Local authorities were either too weak to question or they were manipulated. Internationally accepted ethical guidelines in biomedical research involving human subjects were thrown away. Human beings were treated worse than animals. They were offered bluffs, often intimidated and coerced into vaccine trials. Relevant scientific data including those related to side effects were not recorded. Many mandatory tests were not performed. Yet highly prestigious journals which published and legitimized their so-called findings had never mentioned these misconducts. Often statements were published on matters which were never carried out in the field. In brief, falsification, fabrication and concealment of scientific information became the norms of these scientists. Some of these fraudulent scientists who are intimately connected to big vaccine companies have made large sum of money cheating the poor who cannot speak for themselves. Incidentally, some of these scientists have managed their way into a number of prestigious world bodies controlling global vaccine policies. Ironically, they are mostly citizens of western rich countries who are either directly working or maintaining deep contacts in poor countries. The governments of poor countries hosting vaccine trials often depend on aid from rich nations. Some nations boasting themselves of being very generous aid donors had consciously backed such unethical activities and had profited tremendously by marketing the product. Poor nations that allow their people to become test animals in exchange of foreign aid do not have the courage to protest in fear of loosing aid money. Often protests had appeared in the newspapers of the countries hosting these vaccine trials. But those protests just remained there and seldom reached outside including the offices of the prestigious journal editors who relied on peer reviewers lacking knowledge on the realities of the field. All vaccine trials, no matter where they are carried out, must be supervised by independent and impartial monitors who have no conflict of interest. Editors of scientific journals have a responsibility to see to it that false and fabricated results are not promoted and the journals maintain high scientific standard based on ethical guidelines published in the Declaration of Helsinki concerning biomedical research involving human subjects. Source: [The Independent](http://www.theindependentbd.com/paper-edition/others/freeforall/42010-false-reports-on-vaccine-trials.html) Field trial of the oral cholera vaccine Shanchol in Bangladesh by ICDDR,B has little justification By Ahmed Sadiq News from Bangladesh, Special Report English | [French](http://www.dadychery.org/fr/2012/01/15/haiti-bound-cholera-vaccine-absolutely-useless-according-to-bangladesh-field-trial/) The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) launched on February 17, 2011 a large scale field trial of an Indian oral cholera vaccine on the inhabitants of Mirpur, a suburb of Dhaka by exaggerating the fear of cholera. The vaccine had offered poor protection (only 45 percent) when tested in Kolkata during the first year of follow-up. A recent medical report showed that ICDDR,B had failed to detect the cause of diarrhoea in most of the patients in its treatment centre in Dhaka as only 23 percent of them were diagnosed with cholera. As this vaccine could protect only 10 percent of the recipients against cholera, it is absolutely useless as a diarrhoea control tool. Scientists associated with Shanchol have offered misleading information on the composition, efficiency and cost of the vaccine. Earlier they had cheated fund donors and used 90,000 poor rural women and children as experimental animals in another oral cholera vaccine trial in Bangladesh in 1985. The cholera vaccine trial in Mirpur, Dhaka has generated considerable protests in Bangladesh. The Health Rights Movement National Committee of Bangladesh has taken up the issue. According to the organization's president, Professor Rashid-e-Mahbub , a vested interest was active for marketing cholera vaccines in Bangladesh and ICDDR,B was only pushing the agenda forward. At present, sanitation and not vaccination is the key to cholera control. Has the Government of Bangladesh examined this vaccine critically before allowing it to be swallowed by large number of Bangladeshis? One wonders! How long poor Bangladeshis would be used as experimental animals by foreign drug and vaccine companies? One questions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- SUMMARY The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) launched on February 17, 2011 a large scale field trial of a killed oral cholera vaccine (trade name Shanchol) on 160,000 people of Mirpur (a suburb of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka) by exaggerating the fear of cholera. The vaccine, consisting of a large number of two groups of killed cholera bacteria, had offered poor protection of 45 percent to the vaccinees during the first year when field tested in 2006 on the slum dwellers of Kolkata (West Bengal, India). A recent medical report showed that ICDDR,B had failed to detect the cause of diarrhoea in most of the patients in its treatment centre in Dhaka as only 23 percent of them were diagnosed with cholera. As this vaccine could protect only 10 percent of the recipients against cholera, it is absolutely useless as a diarrhoea control tool. Scientists associated with Shanchol have offered misleading information on the composition, efficiency and cost of the vaccine. Earlier they had cheated fund donors [The World Health Organization (WHO), governments of USA, Japan, Canada, Bangladesh] and used 90,000 poor rural women and children as experimental animals in another oral cholera vaccine trail in Bangladesh in 1985. Although the trial was conducted to develop a cholera vaccine for the poor people, the results were exploited by profit making European vaccine companies to market Dukoral, a highly expensive oral vaccine against diarrhoea, for rich tourists. Public health experts in Bangladesh have alleged ICDDR,B to raise false alarm on cholera and to act as a vehicle for a profit making multinational vaccine company desiring to capture the global cholera vaccine market. They have identified sanitation, not vaccination, as the key to cholera control. To obtain credible results, calls for monitoring the trial by impartial observers have been raised. Scientists associated with Shanchol are notorious in manipulating the truth and show little respect to the directives of the scientific integrity postulated by the office of research integrity (ORI) of the US Government. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, financing the trial, should pay attention to the opinion of public health experts in Bangladesh and should see to it that the principles of ORI are obeyed by the scientists associated with the trial of Shanchol. INTRODUCTION On February 17, 2011 the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) launched a large-scale field trial of a commercial oral cholera vaccine (trade name Shanchol) involving 240,000 inhabitants of Mirpur, a suburb of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka (1). According to the trial plan, 160,000 people received the vaccine and 80,000 remained unvaccinated. The trial, named as the Introduction of Cholera Vaccine in Bangladesh (ICVB), was carried out on the assumption that cholera is a major health problem in Bangladesh. If satisfactory trial results had been produced by ICDDR,B, it would have persuaded the Bangladesh Government to incorporate Shanchol into the national immunization programme, thereby feeding it to all the people of Bangladesh. However, a critical scientific analysis did not support this viewpoint propagated by ICDDR,B. A. The oral vaccine Shanchol is absolutely useless to control cholera The vaccine Shanchol contains large amount of two groups of killed cholera bacteria (Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139). It is administered orally in two doses separated by a two week interval. Immunity develops one week after the second dose (2). The vaccine requires cold chain as it is to be stored at 2-8 degree Celsius. The trial of Shanchol in Dhaka was launched on the basis of the earlier trial of the vaccine in Kolkata (India) in 2006. Its results under a period of two years, reported in a British medical journal (The Lancet) in 2009, showed that the vaccine had offered poor protection as only 40 - 45 percent of those who took the vaccine were protected against cholera during the first year of surveillance (Reference 2, The Lancet, year 2009, volume 374, page 1699, Table 3). A recent study published in April 2011 by ICDDR,B on the diarrhoeal problem in Mirpur area of Dhaka during 2008 - 2010 revealed the following: (i) ICDDR,B, despite bragging always of its latest state of the art technology and being funded immensely by national and international donors, had failed to diagnose the cause of diarrhoea among two-thirds of the patients who came to its treatment centre in Dhaka. (ii) Among the patients, 23 percent had cholera, 11 percent had E. coli diarhoea and 2 percent had diarrhoea due to other bacteria (3). If the people of Mirpur had been vaccinated with Shanchol, only 10 percent of them would have been protected against cholera. Therefore, this cholera vaccine of poor efficacy that can protect only 10 percent of the population against diarrhoea is absolutely useless and not at all required. Children under 5 years of age are most vulnerable to cholera. Another recent study conducted by ICDDR,B in a southern region of Bangladesh during 2005-2007 showed that only 14 percent children under 5 were infected with cholera bacteria (4). This study also showed that ICDDR,B had failed to diagnose more than 60 percent of diarrhoeal cases. Therefore the claim of cholera as a major cause of diarrhoeal illness in Bangladesh, put forward by ICDDR,B, is not supported by scientific evidence. B. Scientists behind the vaccine trial previously cheated the fund donors and trial participants A group of American and Swedish scientists based in South Korea and Sweden (John Clemens of the International Vaccine Institute, South Korea and Jan Holmgren, Gothenburg University Sweden) are the prime pushers of the vaccine ( 2) . They have been working on this vaccine for several years in Vietnam (5). As the Vietnamese drug agency is not recognized internationally, they decided to exploit the Indian drug agency, the later being globally accepted. Hence they moved their operations to Kolkata with a view to capture the global vaccine market. The vaccine is produced in India by Shantha Biotechnics, its parent company being Safoni-Aventis of France. Incidentally the two above-mentioned scientists (John Clemens and Jan Holmgren ) behind the cholera vaccine trial are notorious in manipulating the truth. They have been associated with ICCDR,B for several decades. In 1985, they tested a highly expensive Swedish oral cholera vaccine on 90,000 poor rural women and children at Matlab, the field station of ICDDR,B. The vaccine trial was regarded as being unethical as it had violated the Declaration of Helsinki concerning ethics in biomedical research involving human subjects on several counts (6). Strong criticisms were launched in the Bangladeshi press at that time. Details of these events have been described in a book published by UBINIG, the Bangladeshi organization that had followed the trial (6). John Clemens, Jan Holmgren and a few of their expatriate ICCDR,B colleagues published false results in the Lancet (7). They cheated the financial donors [The World Health Organization (WHO), governments of USA, Canada, Japan and Bangladesh] who had provided millions of dollars supporting the vaccine trial (8 - 10). The vaccine had produced short term protection that did not last even for one year. The vaccine was practically ineffective in children, the targeted population in heavily endemic areas such as Bangladesh (9, 10). The Swedish scientists (Jan Holmgren and his wife Ann-Mari Svenerholm) used the trial results for marketing an expensive vaccine Dukoral (sold at approximately 75 US Dollars in Europe) for rich tourists visiting cholera endemic countries (11, 12). But the trial was carried out in Bangladesh to produce a cholera vaccine for poor people and not for rich tourists. As documents reveal, Jan Holmgren made millions of dollars in cheating 90,000 poor women and children of Bangladesh using them as experimental animals (13). These unfortunate women and children could not speak for themselves and became easy preys to those with little respect for ethical values. Incidentally, this oral cholera vaccine has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not available in the U.S.A. C. Concealing information on the composition of the vaccine and its effectiveness (i) Bacterial content of the vaccine Scientists associated with the vaccine (John Clemens, Jan Holmgren and their Kolkata colleagues) have concealed information on the bacterial content of the vaccine Shanchol from their report published in the journal Lancet (2). They have disguised it under a fictitious term ELISA UNIT which they have neither defined nor have given any reference to it. However, this information was traced in the protocol of the Kolkata trial of the vaccine in 2006 (14). It contained very large amount of cholera bacteria (1.75 billion) per dose, 22 times more than the moderately effective injectable cholera vaccines used until the 1970s. Two doses are required for the immunization course. (ii) Mercury content of the vaccine The report of the Kolkata trial of Shanchol also concealed the presence of the mercury containing compound thiomersal in the vaccine (2). Because of its possible toxic side-effects due to the presence of mercury, most of the vaccines produced in Europe and USA do not contain thiomersal. As Shanchol contains thiomersal at a concentration of 0.02 percent (w/v) [displayed on the vaccine vial] , a single oral dose comprising 1.5 ml of the vaccine would contain 300 microgram (mcg) of thiomersal. In multi-dose vials, WHO mentions of the use of thiomersal in the range of 10 to 50 mcg per dose (15). The thiomersal content of Shanchol is six times higher than the upper limit of thiomersal content of a multi-dose vial quoted by WHO. In addition, WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization recommends the use of a non-mercury based preservative in the oral cholera vaccine (16). The manufacturer of Shanchol should have followed the recommendation. According to a Bangladesh weekly Budhbar, published last March, Firdausi Qadri, the principal scientist of ICDDR,B in charge of the vaccine trial, provided inaccurate information about the composition of the vaccine (17). She claimed that the vaccine contained 0.015 percent thiomersal and did not cite the WHO recommendation on the proper use of thiomersal. (iii) Protective efficacy of the vaccine The vaccine had offered protection of only 45 percent for all age groups during the first year of surveillance. Its efficacy on children under 5, the group most vulnerable to cholera, was not disclosed in the published report (2). Interestingly, the vaccine has been claimed to offer 67 percent protection when monitored after two years (2). The elevated level of protection during the second year in comparison to a much lower level of protection in the first year has not been adequately explained. How was it possible that the protection level had increased so much during the second year? Therefore, the reliability of information coming out of the vaccine trial in Kolkata is questionable. As Shanchol demonstrated poor efficacy soon after its administration, it cannot be regarded as an effective vaccine to control cholera. But scientists propagating this vaccine conceal the disappointing results of the first year and brag about the questionable results of the second year (18). This practice constitutes scientific dishonesty that runs contrary to the guidelines of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) of the US Government that urge scientists to maintain accuracy, integrity and honesty in scientific communications (19). D. Concealing the cost of the vaccine Scientists linked with Shanchol have propagated it as a cheap vaccine costing US $1.0 per dose without mentioning the source and methodology that contributed this information (18). According to the reports in the Indian press, the commercially available two doses of Shanchol, required for the immunization course, were priced at Indian rupees 600 (approximately US $12), hardly an affordable price for the cholera suffering poor people of India or elsewhere (20). It is a bluff thrown by the scientists associated with Shanchol. They have done this also on a previous occasion. The high cost of the vaccine became indeed an issue in protests against the oral cholera vaccine trial of 1985 and was widely mentioned in the Bangladeshi press in the 1980s. In response to those criticisms, Roger Eeckels, then Director of ICDDR,B, issued a bluff stating the cost of the vaccine around $1.50 - $2.00 per dose (21). He further stated that with improved technology of bacterial genetics a simpler process of local vaccine production was to be evolved which would bring the cost down even further. Two decades later another director (David Sack) of ICDDR,B at the Dhaka press conference on April 12, 2007 threw another bluff that one day it would be as affordable as a pack of oral saline (22, 23). Now this ineffective vaccine, sold at a price of US $35 in Bangladesh, is pushed down the throats of Bangladeshis so that profits can flow from Bangladesh to the Dutch manufacturer (Crucell) of Dukoral. In Europe, the vaccine Dukoral is sold at an exorbitant price of US $75. E. The World Health Organization - an umbrella for the company-linked vaccine scientists Scientists associated with commercial killed oral cholera vaccines (Dukoral and Shanchol) control the cholera vaccination programme of WHO (24) and push their agenda through WHO by spreading false information to promote the commercial interests of these vaccines (18). As company linked scientists are associated with various vaccination programmes of WHO, the credibility of this global institution has been severely damaged, as revealed by the prestigious British Medical Journal, the report of the Council of Europe on the swine flu pandemic and also by an article on the Internet (25-29). In brief, the credibility of publications of WHO related to cholera vaccination is questionable and should be very carefully scrutinized. F. US Government guidelines on scientific integrity The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) of the US Government has strict guidelines concerning honesty in scientific research (19). Dishonest practices such as falsification, fabrication, selective publication and ignoring primary sources of information are not endorsed by ORI. Unfortunately, some scientists prefer to give a blind eye to the guidelines of ORI that are universally applicable. It is about time that scientists receiving funding from the US Government should pay attention to the directives of ORI. F. The vaccine trial and the protest The cholera vaccine trial in Mirpur, Dhaka has generated considerable protests in Bangladesh. A number of major publications of Bangladesh have carried out articles criticizing the merits of the trial as ICDDR,B was rightfully alleged to have exaggerated the case of cholera in Bangladesh in order to act as a vehicle for profit making multinational vaccine company (30 - 35). The Government of Bangladesh was not unanimous on the incidence of cholera in Bangladesh as its Director General of Public Health has expressed reservation on this issue (32, 35). Because of dishonesty practiced earlier in the oral cholera vaccine trial of 1985, calls for monitoring the trial by impartial observed have also appeared in the press. The Health Rights Movement National Committee of Bangladesh organized a press conference on cholera vaccination on 14 May, 2011 where the committee correctly stated that sanitation, not vaccination, is the key to cholera control. According to the president of the organization, Professor Rashid-e-Mahbub , a vested interest was active for marketing cholera vaccines in Bangladesh and ICDDR,B was only pushing the agenda forward (32). He stressed that Bangladesh did not need cholera vaccines, as ensuring safe water alone could keep the bacterium at bay. Public health expert Dr. Khairul Islam had expressed similar opinion (32). According to Dr. Islam, designation of cholera as the major cause of children's death fits the agenda of any research organization or vaccine producing company. Diarrhoea or cholera is no more the major cause of the death of children in Bangladesh (32). Considerable progress has been made in recent years as in 2010 Bangladesh received the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) award for reducing child mortality (36). But Ferdausi Qadri, spokesperson of ICDDR,B on the cholera vaccine trial, is oblivious to these developments as she saw vaccination as the only route to salvation (32). Protests against oral cholera vaccine trials are nothing new, especially when one of the key persons is John Clemens of the International Vaccine Institute of South Korea. As a matter of fact, wherever John Clemens had been involved in cholera vaccine trials, in Bangladesh or Mozambique, mass protests had taken place (6, 37). Similar to Bangladesh, people of Mozambique also protested as they felt being treated as experimental animals. Concluding remarks: ICDDR,B has exaggerated the case of cholera in Bangladesh in order to promote an ineffective vaccine of poor protective efficacy produced by a French company that eventually wants to capture the global cholera vaccine market. Twenty six years ago, ICDDR,B also conducted the field trial of another oral cholera vaccine that benefited European vaccine companies to market a highly expensive cholera vaccine for rich tourists from developed countries. Both the fund donors of that trial as well as the poor vaccine recipients of Bangladesh were deceived. Cholera is neither a major health problem in Bangladesh nor Shanchol, the ineffective spaced two-dose vaccine is the answer. People can get cholera in the interval period between the two doses. Cholera is an easily treatable disease that can be effectively cured by different rehydration therapy (oral or intravenous fluids) and if necessary, by antibiotics. At present sanitation and not vaccination is the key to cholera control. Members of the Health Rights Movement National Committee of Bangladesh have stated this very loud and clear at the press conference in Dhaka on May 14, 2011. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funding this trial should pay attention to the opinion of such experts. As the same group of scientists are behind the ongoing cholera vaccine trial as they were behind the highly controversial trial of 1985, it is absolutely necessary that the trial results should be monitored by impartial observers with no conflicts of interest. Otherwise credible results of the trial will not emerge. Scientists associated with Shanchol have concealed information on the composition and cost of the vaccine. They have also propagated selective information on its efficacy. These practices run contrary to the universally accepted guidelines of scientific integrity outlined by ORI of the US Government. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, financing the trial, must see to it that the principles of ORI are strictly followed by the scientists associated with the trial. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- References - 1.
