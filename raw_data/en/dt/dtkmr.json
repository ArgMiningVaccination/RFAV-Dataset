Essential oils are very effective against early colds and other winter diseases... they have many properties (antiseptics, antivirals, antibacterials, immunostimulating ...) and are not to neglect against bacteria and viruses. Before rushing to pharmacy, you can try to treat small winter ills with some essential oils. Make your hydro alcoholic gel Whether in transport, at work... we are constantly confronted with microbes in our places of life and sometimes we cannot wash our hands. Even if good hand hygiene passes through a washing to water and soap, there are alternative solutions ! The hydro-alcohol solution is currently commonly used to control the transmission of bacteria, viruses and fungi by hand contamination and to promote their elimination. In hospitals, these antiseptic soaps are used to prevent nosocomial diseases that can be transmitted during a stay in the hospital or during care. For the general public, hydro-alcoholic gels have generalized to combat virus transmission such as flu, covid-19 (coronavirus) or gastroenteritis. Antibacterial hydro-alcoholic gel is an effective alternative in the absence of water points, for example in public transport. It is very easy to design it yourself. This avoids a shortage in complicated national episodes (remember h1n1 or Covid-19!). we have selected 2 essential oils, known for their powerful antiseptic and antiviral properties. The tea tree:The essential oil of tea tree is the reference antiseptic! It is an essential oil that will act both against bacteria and viruses or yeasts. It therefore has quite its place in the composition of a hydro-alcoholic gel. its main properties are antibacterial and antifungal with broad spectrum, antiviral and immunostimulant. The ravintsara: It's a powerful antiviral. Thanks to its composition rich in 1.8-cineole and alpha terpineol, it is undoubtedly anti-infectious. In addition, this essential oil intervenes as a support for the action of the tea tree since it is also immunostimulating: an effective immune system is an ally against microbes ! These 2 essential oils must be mixed withalcohol at 70\u00b0 and aloe vera gel. Alcohol at 70\u00b0 is an antiseptic and ethanol disinfectant solution. Its action is local and fast, it allows to get rid of the microbes we can meet on our way! As for aloe vera, thanks to its ability to retain water and its composition rich in nutrients, it will moisturize, soften, and soften the skin to make it soft. It is therefore ideal to counter the drying effects of alcohol and essential oils and effectively moisturize hands. To make a hydro alcoholic gel you even 200 ml, nothing simpler. in a small salad bowl, mix first 70 ml of alcohol at 70\u00b0 with50 drops essential oil Tea tree Then 50 drops essential oil Ravintsara. Then add up130 ml of organic aloe vera gel. Mix the whole well then pour into a bottle pumpso that daily use is easier. Just drop a hazelnut from your gel in your hands and rub to good penetration. 30 drops of essential oil equivalent to about 1 ml. Other essential oils can also replace tea tree or ravinstara. we can quote Eucalyptus radiata, Laurier noble, cinnamon or even Lemon or clove. do not hesitate to make your choice in the field of antibacterial and antiviral essential oils. Essential oils are antiseptic These are their properties best proven by modern scientific research. the vast majority of essential oils have antimicrobial or anti-viral power, but some have more than others. essential oils reach the cellular level and participate in the destruction of pathogens (microbes, fungi (mycoses,) viruses, infectious toxins) and the elimination of waste from the metabolism, while respecting the integrity of beneficial flora (saprophyte). Immunity defenses are strengthened. Essential oils are antibacterial The aromatic molecules with the highest antibacterial coefficient are phenols (more than 92% of the susceptible to it): carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, australol and gaicol are also part of this group but the essential oils are less active here. a molecule not belonging to this group but close by the presence of a benzenic nucleus is the cinnamic aldehyde (cannel). Well-used, these four molecules allow the control of most common infections. just behind the phenols we find of aldehydes: neral, geranial, lemonellal and cuminal. C\u00e9tones have neurotoxic and abortive properties make them delicate to use. to a lesser extent, ethers (estragole and anethole) are found as antibacterial oxides, phthalides and terpenes. terpenes are mainly used in diffusion as atmospheric antiseptic. Essential oils are anti-viral Viruses give rise to proteiform pathologies (very varied) some of which pose unresolved problems today. classical responses to these infections being very limited in the pharmaceutical arsenal, essential oils are a stagger to fight viral disorders from the most common to the most dreadful. viruses are generally very sensitive to aromatic molecules and some serious viral pathologies are found to be greatly improved by them. Moreover, healthy cells of patients using essential oils acquire a particular resistance to viral penetration. Essential oil indistinctly acts on all viruses. That is why it is necessary to recommend its systematic use in all viral conditions. In the fight against viruses, the group of hydroxylics (phenol and monoterphenol) is the first of all. knowing that phenols are more powerful but to use with caution. for long-term use, monoterpenolic oils are preferable to much more \"aggressive\" phenolic oils Various tests of virulicide power of essential oils were carried out by laboratories. the toulouse virology laboratory tested the essential oil of melaleuca quinquenervia cineolifera (niaouli) on the herpes virus. after a 15-minute contact time in vitro, virulicide activity results in a fall greater than 40,000. Here is also a very interesting group of aldehydes that have undeniable activity on pathogenic bacteria. not toxic and often pleasant odor, they will be mainly used as an airborne antiseptic (diffusion) or as a surface disinfectant. the best-developed molecule, cinnamaldehyde (channel) has major anti-infective properties to classify it among the most active. its activity also extends to viruses, mycetes and parasites. Clean up ambient air with essential oils The diffusion of essential oils using a micro-diffusion diffuser is a good way to purify ambient air. All essential oils can be technically diffused but some are too \"strong\" to be diffused or then mixed with other more \"soft\" essential oils. The essential oils of lemon, ravintsara, rose wood, eucalyptus radiata, palmarosa can be diffused in a pure state or mix together. On the other hand, cinnamon (leaf) , tea tree, niaouli, glorious eucalyptus, basil, laurel, will have to be mixed with other essential oils before diffusion. Attention even to allergic people, lemon, for example, contains recognized allergenic lemonene. Our synergy to spread to combat viruses: In a 10 ml dropper bottle, mix 2 ml of essential tea tree oil (about 60 drops) + 5 ml of essential lemon oil (about 150 drops) and finally 3 ml of essential oil of black spruce (about 90 drops). pour 30 to 60 drops of the mixture into an electric diffuser or about ten drops in the water of a mistizer, and spread in the living rooms for 10 to 15 minutes. you can also use essential oil [laurier noble](https://www.penntybio.com/en/essential-oils/954-laurier-noble-ab-leaves-5-ml-essential-oil-direct-nature-3700462140432.html) instead of the black thorn. It is also an excellent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal, well tolerated in atmospheric diffusion. How long is a virus contagious ? In the winter period, closed premises and public places are less aired, which facilitates contagion. cough, sneezing, postillons, close contacts with a patient are all means of transmission of viruses from one person to another. transmission can also be done through contaminated objects (door handle, metro bar, pen...). Unfortunately, the risk of contagion is the highest during the incubation period, when symptoms are not yet or barely visible. This incubation phase is dependent on the virus and the individual and lasts an average of 6 to 14 days. Always carry with you a small bottle of antiviral essential oil such as the essential oil of ravintsara or eucalyptus radiate to react as quickly as possible. Deeply breathe directly to the bottle to neutralize the virus and disinfect the airways. What is coronavirus ? Coronaviruses are crown-shaped virions of approximately 120 nm in diameter (2) that are transmitted by air and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in man, poultry and cattle. So far, there were 6 coronaviruses, 4 of which without severity, with slight pseudo-grippal symptoms, and 2 highly pathogenic to man. the latter two infect the upper and lower respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory diseases, accompanied by fever, cough and muscle pain; coronavirus SRAS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and coronavirus MERS-CoV (the Middle East respiratory syndrome). They were the cause of the epidemics in 2002 and 2003. The Chinese virus, identified for the first time, belongs to the coronavirus family and makes it the seventh able to give clinical manifestations in humans. Since the outbreak of the epidemic in the Chinese city of wuhan in December 2019, it has made many victims and does not stop spreading around the world. Since then, vaccines and treatments have been developed, significantly reducing the number of victims. but the virus is constantly changing. the delta variant represents almost all viruses circulating in france, more than 99% of the viruses sequenced. the l452r mutation (mainly carried by the delta variant) was detected in 96% of the positive samples in mid-October 2021. the very effective way to avoid contamination remains to apply strict measures of prevention and general hygiene against any infection.

(source: \"the aromatherapy exactly\" of Francis stone with editions roger jollois) Some articles on viruses Numerous articles on viruses and essential oils have been published. We selected some of them that seemed interesting to us. Above all, \"do not die of fear\", advises Dr. Jean-Pierre willem, surgeon, phytotherapist and president of barefoot doctors. especially since \"we are not disarmed. before the uncertainty of effective chemical therapy, aromatherapy will know its hour of glory, he says. several essential oils have indeed a recognized antiviral action, there are hundreds of references proving their effectiveness. \u00bb - \"the essential oils: antiviral agents\": this was also the theme of the 6th International Conference of Clinical Aromatherapy, last April in san francisco, where world doctors and specialists, including the pr j\u00fcrgen reichling of the University of Heidelberg, presented their latest work. - The dr christian duraffourd, president of the French company of phytotherapy and aromatherapy recalls that \"the anti-infectious possibilities of essential oils (provided that they are neither rectified nor modified) are clear for all acute or chronic infections, whether microbial or viral. \u00bb - Is it necessary to prevent essential oils? if it can be good to use them by cures to strengthen its terrain (inhalations, massages or even suppositories), the dr willem is of the opinion that \"it will be time, in case of pandemic, to spread it in the atmosphere of the homes and to take antiviral capsules proposed by natural product laboratories. In the health practice journal, it also advocates friction with essential oils containing molecules called monotonous (ravensara de basil, sarriette). which, stronger, must be diluted in oil before use. - Dr lablanchy also advises essential oil of ravensara as well as vitamin c (anti-viral) in prevention. He also insists on the immunodepressant effect of stress: \"Researchers find more and more links between nervous and immune systems. Wouldn't it be, in fact, the same system? \u00bb - Still upstream of these few precious natural therapeutics (there are many others) one must of course focus on the basic health factors. It is true primary prevention. \"The nerve of war,\" says Dr.John Paul curtay, \"is energy. The best opportunity to catch a cold or to get a herpes thrust is to be tired. \"Our energy rate and immunity depend primarily on sober and truly healthy nutrition, good breathing, good sleep, regular physical exercise, avoidance of pollutants (chemicals, tobacco, white sugar, fine flours and refined oils, etc.). and vitamins (a, c, e, d). minerals (fer and, above all, zinc) that maintain good "}
