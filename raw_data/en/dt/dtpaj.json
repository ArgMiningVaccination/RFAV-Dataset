Throughout its 75-year history, the Wellcome Trust has supported a broad spectrum of research focusing on malaria. The research has encompassed: the biology of the parasites and vector; new vaccines and drugs; clinical research to improve treatment and to understand the pathology of the disease; disease transmission and epidemiology; health services research; health policy research; medical humanities; and, recently, through the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI), pathogen and genome sequencing.1 2. Over the past 20 years, across its research programmes and funding divisions, the Wellcome Trust has awarded 515 grants to malaria-focused research. These grants account for \u00a3189 million,2 representing just over 3 per cent of the Trust's total funding commitment over this time. Funding has been provided through 1 This report focuses on human malaria infection research, encompassing parasite and vector biology, host response and pathogenesis, resources and infrastructure, drug development, diagnostics, evaluation and resistance, epidemiology (surveillance and distribution), vaccinology, health services, ethics and policy research, prevention and control (including vector control), research design, technology and methodology, and the history of malaria. 2 Wellcome Trust funding commitment between the financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008.project-based grants and to support researchers across their career stages, from junior fellows to principal researchers. Wellcome Trust investments have been made both within the UK and outside the UK, particularly in malaria-endemic countries. During this time, an additional \u00a3120m (52 grants) was allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the Trust's Major Overseas Programmes (MOPs); much of the work undertaken in these Centres and MOPs has played a part in facilitating malaria-focused research and providing training and research capacity development. In addition, the WTSI spend on malaria-focused research during this time period was \u00a38.8m. 3. This review, conducted in late 2009 and 2010, aims to identify the key breakthroughs in malaria R&D over the past 20 years and the Wellcome Trust's role within this. As in any review of the outcomes of research, an intrinsic challenge for a funder is to understand the part it has played among the range of influences and actors that are involved in shaping and delivering research. Indeed, to attempt to attribute breakthroughs in a field solely to an event, researcher and/or funder is to take an improbable view of the way in which science and knowledge progress. To counter this, with the support of a group of independent subject experts, we have attempted to identify where the Wellcome Trust is thought to have played a significant part in the field.Overview and key findings Key abbreviations used in the report ACT Artemisinin-based combination therapy MIM Multilateral Initiative on Malaria CCGH MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health MMV Medicines for Malaria Venture CDC US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention MOPS Major Overseas Programmes DDT Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane MVI The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative DFID UK Department for International Development MRC Medical Research Council EVIMalaR European Virtual Institute of Malaria Research NIH US National Institutes of Health FP7 Seventh Framework Programme NITD Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases G-FINDER Global Funding of Innovation for Neglected Diseases PATH Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health The Global Fund The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria PDP Product development partnership HRCSI Health Research Capacity Strengthening Initiative RBM Roll Back Malaria Partnership IHME Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation R&D Research and development INSERM French National Institute of Health and Medical Research RDT Rapid diagnostic test IVCC Innovative Vector Control Consortium TDR WHO-based Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical DiseasesKEMRI Kenya Medical Research Institute LSHTM London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine USAID US Agency for International Development malERA Malaria Eradication Research Agenda WHO World Health Organization MalariaGEN Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network WTCMP Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology MDG Millennium Development Goal WTSI Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute4. We also wanted to use this review in a formative way, to inform future funding strategy; therefore, we bring expert reflections on past developments and crucial breakthroughs together with views on current challenges and future opportunities for research in malaria - both for the Wellcome Trust and for all those involved in supporting research into malaria. 5. Over the past two decades, Wellcome Trust funding has contributed to some of the most important advances and discoveries in malaria research (see Landmarks in Malaria Timeline). In particular, there are four areas where the Wellcome Trust is thought to have had a significant impact on the field: the sustained provision of project- and people-based funding for malaria-focused research leaders and young researchers in the field - who, in turn, have delivered a range of breakthroughs in our knowledge of malaria and approaches to tackling the disease the support for genomic science, primarily at the WTSI, which is helping to enhance our understanding of the basic biology of malaria the support for research capacity building and infrastructure in malaria-endemic regions (particularly through MOPs), which have helped to deliver important clinical investigation studies and tangible impacts on the human malaria burden the involvement of and support for multi-agency, cross-sector partnerships and collaborations, which have been important in targeting malaria from several angles. 6. Despite the breakthroughs in our understanding of malaria and evidence of global reductions in the burden of the disease over the past two decades, malaria remains difficult to treat and endemic in many parts of the world and there is no licensed vaccine approved for human use. Although basic research remains key to improving our understanding of human malaria, the majority of the reduction in the global burden of malaria thus far is thought to be the result of investments in clinical investigation and preventative research, associated campaigns and the delivery of interventions. More work needs to be done to translate the improvements in our knowledge of malaria into strategies that have a tangible impact upon health. While this is being done, we should maintain a focus on the clinical and preventative research where current advances are being made in the fight against malaria. To this end, to ensure continued progress towards malaria elimination and eradication, a diversity of sustainable funding for malaria research is needed.7. International and multi-lateral initiatives and networking have proved to be significant cohesive factors in advancing malaria research; engagement in, and support of, such initiatives can only help increase the effectiveness of investments into malaria research in the future. 8. In summary, we - with the help of our experts - have identified several ongoing and emerging challenges and priorities for the future of malaria research. Ensure continued support for research into basic immune and biological mechanismsImprovements in our understanding of several basic research areas (including the biology, biochemistry, immunology and pathobiology of malaria) are needed, specifically: the basic biology of all species of the Plasmodium parasite, but particularly P. vivax the basic metabolic functions of the Plasmodium species, including metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics the complex mechanisms underlying the immunobiology of malaria. There is also a need for robust model systems to support human immunological research. The importance of clinical research and clinical investigation The Expert Group were in agreement that support for clinical research is crucial if we are to continue to deliver improvements in human health, to complement the ongoing basic research effort. More focus should be given to understanding the pathology and physiology of the disease. In terms of severe malaria, in particular, continued support for clinical research into the pathophysiology of acidosis, anaemia, renal failure and pulmonary oedema is needed. Ensure a pipeline of antimalarial drugs The Expert Group discussed the implications of emerging and increasing drug resistance in malaria and emphasised the need for the development of a sustained pipeline of antimalarial drugs. It was agreed that the least expensive and most effective research investment at present would be to optimise the dose regimens for currently available antimalarial drugs. Several priorities for malaria drug development and improvement were highlighted: the need to optimise dose regimens for currently available antimalarial drugsPortfolio Review: Malaria | 7 6 | Portfolio Review: Malaria the need for novel drugs to tackle other malaria parasites, particularly P. vivax, which will necessitate a clearer understanding of their resistance mechanisms the need for significant investment in building malaria-focused pharmacology and pharmacokinetic research capacity the implementation of novel management systems to monitor the use of compounds in the field to protect the drug supply pipeline. A need to expand the armoury of, and access to, quality-assured diagnostic testingInvestment in antimalarial drug development should be accompanied by commitments to improve diagnostic tools and their availability to ensure appropriate drug treatment and to prevent presumptive treatment of malaria. Achieving high-quality diagnosis in remote and low-resource areas remains a huge challenge because of methodological variability, the lack of reproducibility and the lack of quality control programmes in the field setting. There are important opportunities for funders such as the Wellcome Trust to support research to enhance rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), including novel low-cost diagnostics that can detect very low levels of malaria parasites in asymptomatic individuals, and to support their availability in low-resource settings. A need for improved and novel vector control tools The Expert Group discussed potential approaches to meet the challenges of malaria vector control and proposed directions for future work, including research into: vector biology, to support the discovery of alternatives to pyrethroids and new vector control tools how community health services can be best mobilised to implement measures such as insecticide-treated bednets and long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets the optimum use of existing vector control methods, such as the use of indoor residual spraying alone or in combination with insecticide-treated bednets scaling up and improving the maintenance of existing vector control measures and ensuring their regular and proper use is essential supporting capacity building and training strategies to address the relative lack of senior entomologists working in the field and assure the pipeline of trained junior researchers entering the field. Enhanced information systems, surveillance tools and technologiesWithout adequate, high-quality surveillance data, monitoring the progress and efforts of malaria control programmes is impossible. Major limiting factors to improving malaria surveillance in resource-poor settings include the weak information infrastructures and lack of adequately trained staff to capture, interpret and analyse the incidence and mapping data - particularly in malaria-endemic regions. Enhanced surveillance tools are required, and they need to be complemented by improvements in health information systems and training to ensure their use in the field. Encouraging collaboration between researchers, information technology providers and industry could have also have a major impact. Integrated databases to enable data sharing The Expert Group emphasised the need for funders to support the development of shared, publicly accessible integrated databases that bring together diverse datasets from the host, parasite and vector research communities. Such databases are likely to: enable the exchange of robust information (positive and negative) between the host, pathogen and vector communities facilitate data sharing between basic and clinical scientists enable the malaria research community to share clinical trial data enable the efficient exchange of immunology data help facilitate a systems biology approach to malaria research provide a deeper understanding of the complex host-pathogen system increase the speed at which new drugs are developed. A need to strengthen research capacity and support trainingOne thread running through this review was the importance of building and sustaining researcher capacity across all the relevant disciplines that contribute to malaria research. To enable this, it was agreed that a focus on short-term and long-term capacity development - both human and infrastructure and systems capacity - is needed. In addition, the Expert Group emphasised the need for improved coordination between researchers working in the field in endemic countries and their international counterparts to ensure that research findings and expertise are shared.A recognition of the importance of international, multi-sector collaborations to tackle malariaInternational collaborations, public-private partnerships and product development partnerships (PDPs), bringing together appropriate expertise to address the complexities of malaria treatment and prevention, have been very important in the fight against malaria to date. Despite the increased funding for malaria research since the early 1990s (from $121m in 1993 to $612m in 2009), malaria funding remains unevenly distributed across regions and product areas.3 It was agreed that public, private and philanthropic funders should continue to seek out opportunities to work together to minimise the risk of over-reliance on one funder or sector and to ensure a well-balanced, responsive and flexible portfolio of malaria-related research funding across the globe. To ensure consideration of the social, political and ethical implications of malaria-related researchLooking ahead, it remains crucial that we, as funders, work together with the research community and other funders to engage in key policy issues that surround the conduct of malaria-related research and its application to improve the prevention, control and treatment of the disease globally. Key issues include access to medicines, ethical issues that surround the conduct of clinical research in low- and middle-income countries, and the uptake of research evidence to policy. To support dialogue with relevant policy and public stakeholdersThe Expert Group emphasised the importance and value of raising public awareness of the problems of malaria and the continued need to develop and deliver public awareness campaigns. Public consultation and participation in open dialogue, upstream in the research process, ensure the development of appropriate, culturally relevant technologies. Engagement activities and cultural and social research can help determine the most appropriate way to engage with particular communities, to conduct research and to design health promotion strategies. 3 PATH.

The review is both reflective and prospective, with three specific aims: to identify the key landmarks and influences on the malaria research landscape over the past two decades (1990-2009); to consider what have been the key features of the Wellcome Trust's impact on this malaria research landscape; to consider the current and future challenges for malaria research and where there may be opportunities for Wellcome Trust strategy and funding. 9. To deliver on these aims, we undertook three specific streams of work (see Annex B for detail): funding, policy and bibliometric landscape analysis narrative case studies an Expert Group, convened to provide an independent view of key landmarks in the development of malaria and the role of the Wellcome Trust, and to speculate on the future. 10. Deciphering the funding investments made into malaria prevention, treatment and diagnosis is complex because of the plethora of agencies involved across the globe and the different ways in which information is recorded. Similarly, data on how much R&D funding has been invested to combat malaria and understand its aetiology, pathogens and transmission mechanisms are difficult to derive precisely. Notable progress has been made, however, after the introduction of the Global Funding of Innovation for Neglected Diseases (G-FINDER) annual survey in 2008. The G-FINDER survey has proved a valuable resource for our landscape analysis.12 11. We intend to use this review to learn from our support of malaria research to date and to inform potential future directions. In addition, we hope that this review is of value to other stakeholders - including funders - involved in supporting malaria research, both by highlighting areas where new and continued research is required and in guiding the selection of mechanisms and, potentially, policies to support research. 12 The G-FINDER survey, now in its fourth year, provides comprehensive data on public and private funding into R&D for neglected diseases, including malaria. The G-FINDER survey is conducted by the independent research group Policy Cures and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.1. Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans and other animals that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. This report focuses on human malaria infection and is limited to the six species of malaria parasite that can infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale,4 Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi. 2. Malaria is one of the world's chief public health concerns. An estimated 216 million cases of malaria, and an estimated 655 000 malaria deaths were reported by the WHO in 2010 - around 86 per cent of whom were children under the age of five.5 The WHO estimates that there are currently 106 countries where malaria is endemic, with approximately 3.3 billion people 'at risk' of the disease (approximately half of the world's population). A recent study led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle does, however, question the WHO estimates. The IHME study estimated that there were 1.24 million malaria deaths worldwide in 2010 - almost double the WHO estimate of 655 000 malaria deaths for 2010. More than 40 per cent (524 000 individuals) of the victims were older children and adults, challenging the belief that the vast majority of deaths occur among the under-fives. If confirmed, this picture of malaria morbidity and mortality has huge implications for malaria control programmes. 3. Nevertheless, there are signs that the burden of malaria in endemic countries is decreasing; this is thought to be largely due to the recent scale-up in access to antimalaria interventions, such as artemisinin-based drugs, insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying.6 ,7 However, funding support for malaria needs to be sustained if international targets for malaria elimination and eradication are to be achieved. 4. The direct and indirect costs of the disease are significant, affecting not only the quality of life of individuals and the ability of healthcare infrastructures to cope with the burden of disease but also the productivity and economic prosperity of 4 Plasmodium ovale has been shown by genetic methods to consist of two separate species, Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri. See Sutherland CJ et al. Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale occur globally. J Infect Dis 2010;201:1544-50. 5 World Health Organization. 2011.

It is estimated that in Africa alone, these 'costs' of malaria amount to $12bn per year.8 The Copenhagen Consensus9 ranked malaria prevention and treatment as its 12th most cost-effective intervention in their list of 200810 (malaria was ranked fourth in the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus11), and it remains very high on the international agenda and third in the Copenhagen Consensus list of disease states needing attention and/or investment. 5. The two most common variants of human malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax; P. falciparum is responsible for the majority (98 per cent) of malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas P. vivax accounts for an estimated 25-40 per cent of the global malaria burden and is particularly common in Asia and South America. 6. The Wellcome Trust has a long history of funding malaria research and was a pioneer in the development of defined programmes of research into tropical diseases, particularly malaria. Henry Foy became the Trust's first medical research programme director - at the Malaria Research Laboratory, in Thessaloniki, Greece - in 1938. In 1949, Dr Foy and his long-standing colleague Dr Athena Kondi moved to establish the Wellcome Trust Laboratories at the Kenyatta Hospital in Nairobi; the laboratory in Kenya still remains. Now in partnership with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), it is one of the Wellcome Trust's MOPs. From the second half of the 20th century, the Wellcome Trust has continued to fund malaria-related research across the world, and 'combating infectious disease' remains a key part of the Wellcome Trust's funding strategy today. 7. Conducted during the second half of 2009 and early 2010, this review aims to identify the key breakthroughs in human malaria-related research over the past 20 years and attempts to identify the role of the Wellcome Trust within this landscape. This review is the third in a series aimed to help us to assess the impact of the Trust's funding at a macro, subject portfolio level. The first two portfolio reviews focused on human genetics and human functional brain imaging from 1990 to 2009. 8 Greenwood BM et al. Malaria. Lancet 2005;365(9469):1487-98. 9 The goal of Copenhagen Consensus 2008 was to set priorities among a series of proposals for confronting ten global challenges: air pollution, conflicts, diseases, education, global warming, malnutrition and hunger, sanitation and water, subsidies and trade barriers, terrorism, and women and development. A panel of world economists rank the proposals predominantly by consideration of economic costs and benefits. 10 www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Home.aspx 11 www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=1581. Introduction and backgroundPortfolio Review: Malaria | 13 12 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 12. Over the past few decades, there has been a series of coordinated international efforts to control, eliminate and eradicate malaria (see Timeline). During the 1950s and 1960s, a string of eradication campaigns - including the WHO Global Malaria Eradication Programme (1955-1972), which succeeded in helping to eliminate malaria in 16 countries and territories - were curtailed because of the emergence of drug and insecticide resistance, together with problems in the feasibility and sustainability of malaria control in areas with weak infrastructure and high transmission. 13. During the 1990s, malaria control was re-established as a global health priority by the WHO Global Malaria Strategy (1992), the formation of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM, 1997) and the launch of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM, 1998). In 2000, the United Nations declared 2001-2010 the 'Decade to Roll Back Malaria' in low-income countries, the objectives of which have been built into the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - eight goals adopted by the 189 member nations of the UN in 2000 to provide a framework for the international community to combat poverty. There are eight MDGs, 18 targets and 44 indicators to be achieved by 2015.13 The specific MDGs linked to malaria14 are: MDG 4: to have [by 2015] halted, and begun to reverse, the incidence of malaria MDG 6: reduce [by 2015] by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under five. 14. These global strategies together with the Global Fund for AIDs, Tuberculosis and Malaria, since its inception in 2002, have made some significant inroads; for example, the WHO reported that malaria mortality rates have declined by about 26 per cent since 2000.15 More recently, a study by the IHME published in the Lancet described a similar, significant 32 per cent decline in malaria deaths since 2004.16 13 The eight MDGs are to: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development. 14 undp.org/mdg/basics.shtml 15 World Health Organization. 2011.

In 2011, the RBM revealed that nearly one-third of the 106 malaria-endemic countries are on course to eradicate the disease within ten years, with three countries already certified as malaria free by the WHO since 2007 (Morocco, Turkmenistan and Armenia).17 16. Although much progress has been made, with some countries reaching the 2010 universal coverage targets18 for at least one malaria control intervention, continued progress and funding support is needed from other countries and donors to enable the World Health Assembly and the RBM goals for malaria to be realised and to meet the MDGs in 2015. 17. Up until 2010, international investment in malaria R&D continued to rise, driven largely by the MDGs. In 2002, the estimated global investment in malaria R&D was $200m; by 2009, it had risen to approximately $593.8m (see Table 1). In 2010, global funding for malaria R&D decreased by $45.5m (7.8 per cent) compared to 2009, although this reduction is thought to reflect the near-completion of the malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S development programme (see Table 1). 18. Malaria R&D funding remains highly concentrated, with 12 funders accountable for 92.5 per cent of funding ($547m in 2010). The G-FINDER reports that financial investment in malaria R&D showed a significant decrease in funding from the USA in 2010. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest funder of malaria R&D in 2009, reduced its funding by $95.2m (52.2 per cent) and the US Department of Defence by $14.9m, a 39.7 per cent decrease (see Table 1). These reductions are partly offset by a $20.2m (563 per cent) increase in funding from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and a $16.9m (14.5 per cent) increase from the US Government's National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2010. 17 Roll Back Malaria Partnership. 2011. Eliminating Malaria: Learning from the past, looking ahead. www.rbm.who.int/ProgressImpactSeries/docs/report9-en.pdf 18 rbm.who.int/rbmroadmaps.html19. Malaria is currently a key focus area for the Gates Foundation's Global Health Programme. It has a five-point strategy for the assault on malaria: develop malaria vaccines, develop more effective and affordable drugs and diagnostics, develop new tools to control mosquitoes, research the effectiveness of malaria interventions, and advocate for policies and financing.20 In 2012, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed $750m to help sustain the Global Fund. The new commitment is in addition to the $650m already contributed by the foundation to the Global Fund since it was launched in 2002. 20. The NIH supports research through the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Fogarty International Centre. The US Department of Defence and US Agency for International Development (USAID) also feature among the top international active funders of malaria R&D in 2010. 19 Source: Moran M et al. Neglected Disease Research and Development: Is innovation under threat? Policy Cures; 2011. G-FINDER grant data includes disbursements made only for active primary grants and does not include 'committed' or grant funding for infrastructure at the Wellcome Trust Centres/MOPs/JRIFs/SRIFs. The Wellcome Trust funding analysis in this portfolio review includes all 'active' and 'completed' grants between the financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008, including grant funding for infrastructure at the Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs. 20 See www.gatesfoundation.org/topics/Pages/malaria.aspx#.21. Funding from Europe - outside the UK - flows primarily through the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for 2007-2013.21 The development process of the next Framework Programme (to be referred to as Horizon 2020), which will replace FP7 in 2014, is underway, but it is not clear whether Horizon 2020 will involve less funding for malaria research. Malaria is identified as a target area for research support with funding primarily targeted at basic research and vector control. Other major funders in Europe include the Institut Pasteur in France ($9m in 2010), which is also a prominent institute for malaria research, and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research ($4.5m in 2010). 21 ec.europa.eu/2. Malaria research: the global research landscape Table 1 Top 12 malaria R&D funders 201019Portfolio Review: Malaria | 15 14 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 22. Within the UK, the Wellcome Trust and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) are significant funders, reporting $34m and $22.4m of active malaria-focused research grants, respectively, in 2010. Much of the MRC's malaria work is conducted at its Unit in The Gambia, which focuses on infectious diseases prevalent in The Gambia, and the MRC National Institute for Medical Research. The Wellcome Trust has been in the top five in the list of agencies contributing the most funds to malaria for the four years of the G-FINDER study - disbursing an estimated $28m, $27m, $27m and $34m in R&D during 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively (see Table 1).22 23. In 1992, with initial contributions from the MRC,23 the WTSI was established as an advanced facility for mapping, sequencing and decoding the human genome and the genomes of other organisms. One of the earliest genomes to be sequenced through a collaborative project at the Institute was the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Today at the WTSI, the malaria programme uses genomic approaches to study malaria (see Dominic Kwiatkowski case study). 24. Other significant funders outside of Europe include Australia. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council spent $9.6m on malaria R&D in 2010 (see Table 1). The Australian Government is a major supporter of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, which has malaria as a research focus area. 22 The Wellcome Trust spend reported in G-FINDER is based on only active, malaria-specific R&D projects and hence does not correlate with our funding analysis, which includes commitments made and funding for infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs to support and facilitate malaria-related research (see Figure 1, Tables 3 and 3a, Annex C). 23 The MRC contributed approximately \u00a324m to the WTSI for the period up to the end of 2002. Source: WTSI.25. Several multilateral and multi-agency initiatives have been established over the past two decades to tackle malaria, and these have involved large research components. Product development specifically has received a significant boost in funding over the past decade thanks to the establishment of malaria-related PDPs - such as the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV),24 the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) and the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative.25 PDPs address the lack of profit-making incentive to develop pharmaceutical products in low-income countries by bringing together dedicated sources of funding from government, philanthropic and corporate donors. 2.1 Malaria publication output: 1989-2008 26. The increase in funding for malaria-related research over the past two decades is reflected in the associated peer-review publication output. The absolute volume of publications related to malaria research has grown steadily over the past 20 years. Since 1991, there has been a three-fold increase in the numbers of papers, from just over 1000 in 1991 to more than 3000 in 2008. In 1989, malaria research represented 0.1 per cent of all global research publications; by 2008, this proportion had increased to 0.3 per cent of global research output (Figure 1). 27. Over the past two decades, malaria research has been produced by a core set of countries. The relative position of these countries in terms of volume of output to which they are linked is shown in Figure 2.26 Over the 20-year time period, the proportion of papers linked to the UK has grown, from 16 per cent of the world total between 1989 and 1993 to 19.1 per cent between 2004 and 2008 (725 and 2657, respectively) - see Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 1, Annex D. 24 Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) is a product development public-private partnership, which was established in 1999 and is dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering new affordable antimalarial drugs in malaria-endemic countries (www.mmv.org). 25 The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), which was established in 2003, is a collaborative, patient-needs-driven, non-profit drug R&D organisation that is developing new treatments for malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) and Chagas' disease (www.dndi.org). 26 The top ten countries have been modified to include Malawi (ranked 32nd), because the Trust is interested in outputs linked to the Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Malawi, and exclude Japan, which was ranked in tenth position.28. Overall, throughout this period the UK has retained its 'second place' behind the USA in terms of malaria research publication output (Figure 2). The USA has maintained its leading position in share of global output, producing approximately one-third of the total output, and remains the single biggest producer of malaria research publications (Figure 2 and Table 1, Annex D). 29. The relative position of most of the countries in the top ten ranked by volume of malaria research output has not changed over the past two decades. The exception is Germany, whose relative output increased during the mid- to late 1990s and early 2000s, although its output is now stable (see Figure 3). 30. Outside Europe, countries showing a steady increase in both absolute numbers of papers and relative proportion of papers in this field since the late 1980s include India and Kenya (see Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 1, Annex D). In terms of world total publication outputs in the field, the number of papers associated with institutions in India has risen from 4.1 per cent in 1989 to 6.1 per cent in 2008 and in Kenya from 2.8 per cent of the world total in 1989 to 4.8 per cent in 2008 (see Figure 3). Elsewhere, countries showing notable growth in terms of malaria research publication production include Belgium, South Africa, Tanzania, Malawi and Japan (see Table 1 and Table 2, Annex D). Figure 1 Number of malaria papers and as percentage of all research papers, 1989-2008 Portfolio Review: Malaria | 17 16 | Portfolio Review: Malaria Figure 2 Malaria papers linked with 'top ten most productive' countries, 1989-2008 (by volume)27,28,29 30 Malaria papers linked to the 'top ten most productive' countries was modified to include Malawi (ranked 32nd) and exclude Japan (ranked tenth) because the Wellcome Trust is interested in outputs linked to the Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Malawi. 31 In this analysis, 'highly cited papers' are those papers with an average rebased impact of at least four (i.e. they have received at least four times as many citations by the end of 2008 as the average paper published in that year in the same subject area).32 The Universities of Oxford and Liverpool and the LSHTM have well-known tropical medicine centres or schools, including: the MALAWI-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Research Programme based in Blantyre; the Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University- Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme in Thailand; the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (a partnership between KEMRI, University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust); and the Joint Malaria Programme (a collaboration between the National Institute for Medical Research of Tanzania, the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College, the LSHTM and the University of Copenhagen). 33 University of Liverpool includes Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, the MALAWI-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Research Programme based in Blantyre and the Liverpool Wellcome Trust Tropical Centre.27 The time trend of malaria papers linked to the 'top ten most productive' countries was modified to include Malawi (ranked 32nd) and exclude Japan (ranked tenth) because the Wellcome Trust is interested in outputs linked to the Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Malawi. 28 The data for the USA have been reduced by a factor of three to bring them into a common range. 29 The significant increase in research papers from China over the past decade, as evidenced in the human genetics 1990-2009 portfolio review, has yet to be demonstrated in malaria-related research using this method.Figure 3 Malaria papers linked with 'top ten most productive' countries, 1989-2008 (five-year periods)30 31. Analysis of the subject focus of malaria-related publication output over time shows that much of the output, not surprisingly, has been published predominantly in 'tropical medicine' and 'parasitology' journals (see Figure 4). Although over the past two decades there has been an increase in the volume of malaria-related papers across all subject areas, the most striking growth has been in journals focusing on the basic sciences - specifically 'medicinal chemistry', 'biochemistry/molecular biology' and 'microbiology' (see Figure 4 and Table 3, Annex D).32. In terms of world publication outputs within the field of malaria, the number of malaria-related papers appearing in 'immunology'-related journals has declined over the past 20 years - from 8.8 per cent of the world total (between 1989 and 1993) to 3.1 per cent (between 2004 and 2008).33. Moving beyond the volume of output, citation analysis31 is helpful to identify from where high-quality, highly cited research originates. Citation data for 20 years (1989-2008) were used to determine the origins and affiliation of the most highly cited malaria papers worldwide. Over the whole period, most of the prolific institutions are located in high-income countries, particularly the UK and the USA. Of the 20 institutions listed in Table 4, Annex D, nine institutions are UK-based and five are USA-based. 34. The University of Oxford and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) are linked to the most highly cited papers in malaria research worldwide over the 20-year period.32 The University of Liverpool33 is ranked sixth after KEMRI (Kenya), Mahidol University (Thailand) and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reflecting the strength of UK research in and commitment to malaria. Portfolio Review: Malaria | 19 18 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 35. The top five authors in terms of producing the most highly cited papers in malaria research worldwide, Nick White, Brian Greenwood, Kevin Marsh, Bob Snow and Adrian Hill (See Table 5, Annex D) - all of whom have received significant funding from the Wellcome Trust over this period (see Table 5, Annex C) - are linked to the top three institutions (see Table 4, Annex D).36. In 2009, the journal Lab Times published an analysis of papers from 1996 to 2007, which showed that Wellcome Trust-funded researchers feature strongly in author citation in the parasitology field - including the top seven.34 Nick White and Kevin Marsh were the two most cited. 34 Neumann R.

Only journals relevant to parasitology were included in the analysis.You [Wellcome Trust] have picked the right people and you have supported them, and it has paid off very well and how do you replicate that, I don't know. But that is genius.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 37. Over the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in our knowledge of malaria, most of which has resulted from funding basic, curiosity-driven research. However, much of the advance, in terms of tangible impacts upon health, has come from a better understanding of how to measure, prevent and treat malaria in people using existing tools (including long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying), approaches for the clinical management of malaria, and developing and validating effective treatments for malaria such as intermittent preventative treatment during pregnancy, artemisinin combination treatment, artesunate-mefloquine fixed-dose combination, artesunate for severe malaria and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. 38. This review highlighted four broad areas where the Wellcome Trust is thought to have had a significant impact on the field of malaria: the sustained provision of project and people- based funding for malaria-focused research leaders and young researchers in the field who, in turn, have delivered a range of breakthroughs in our knowledge of and approach to tackling malaria the support of genomic science at the WTSI, which is enhancing our understanding of the basic biology of malaria the support of research capacity building and infrastructure in malaria-endemic regions (particularly through the MOPs), which have helped to deliver important clinical investigation studies and tangible impacts on the malaria burden the involvement with and support of multi-agency, cross-sector partnerships and collaborations that have shaped the direction of malaria - both within and outside the field. Advances in knowledge in malaria research associated with Wellcome Trust funding are set out in Table 2 and Timeline (Annex E).3.1 Building research capacity and infrastructure In terms of capacity building, the Trust has been absolutely central, because they have committed long-term significant resources. It is only now, 20 years down the line, that there is a really strong cohort of African scientists coming through.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 39. Since the establishment of the Wellcome Trust Laboratories by Henry Foy at the Kenyatta Hospital in Nairobi during the late 1940s, the Wellcome Trust has worked to build capacity and expertise in malaria research. The Expert Group highlighted that one of the Trust's major strengths is its ability to provide sustained support for research capacity and infrastructure - as it has done for malaria research - both inside and outside the UK. 40. Over the past two decades, the Wellcome Trust has supported malaria researchers through all stages of their careers through personal and institution-based grants (see Tables 5, 5a, and Table 6, Annex C). The Wellcome Trust has thus contributed to the formation of a new generation of malaria researchers and excellent research leaders, many of whom are now informing national and international policy and directing research efforts, both in the UK and overseas (see case studies). 41. Between the financial years 1989/90 and 2007/08, the Wellcome Trust committed approximately \u00a3189m35 to malaria-focused research across all its funding divisions. During this time, an additional \u00a3120m was allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the MOPs, as well as a further \u00a38.8m on malaria-focused research through the WTSI (see Tables 3 and 3a, Annex C). As described in section 2, the Wellcome Trust has been in the top five global funders of R&D for new products for all four years of the G-FINDER study - disbursing an estimated $28m, $27m, $27m and $34m in funding during the financial years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.36 ,37 35 Excludes Wellcome Trust funding for infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs (52 grants, \u00a3120m). 36 Overall, malaria was the second highest neglected disease area funded ($468m in 2007, $540m in 2008 and $595m in 2009) after HIV/AIDS ($1.08bn in 2007, $ 1.16bn in 2008 and $1.14bn in 2009). In 2010, malaria was the third highest neglected disease area funded ($547m in 2010) after HIV/AIDS ($1.1bn in 2010) and tuberculosis ($6bn in 2010). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ranked as top malaria funder in 2007 ($124m), 2008 ($173m) and 2009 ($182m) of the G-FINDER study. In 2010, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ranked third ($87m). The US NIH was 2010's largest funder of malaria R&D. 37 Wellcome Trust grant data in this review are not comparable with G-FINDER grant data. G-FINDER grant data include disbursements made only for active primary grants. Wellcome Trust funding data include all active and completed grants between the Figure 4 Malaria papers published in five-year periods by subject category (1989-2008)3. Looking back: the Wellcome Trust and malaria Data: Thomson Reuters 2009; Analysis: Evidence, Thomson Reuters (Scientific UK).Portfolio Review: Malaria | 21 20 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 42. Through its funding divisions, the Wellcome Trust has awarded 515 grants,38 mainly in responsive mode, to malaria-focused projects - accounting for \u00a3189m, representing just over 3 per cent of the Trust's funding commitment over this time (see Tables 3 and 3a, Annex C). Of this, approximately two-fifths (42 per cent by number; 42 per cent by value; 216 grants; \u00a380m) of malaria grant funding has been careers based, supporting individual researchers doing malaria-based projects via personal support schemes (Table 1 and Figure 2, Annex C). These personal support schemes include studentships (\u00a39m), early career fellowships (\u00a38m), and Intermediate (\u00a325m) and Senior/Principal research fellowships (\u00a338m). 43. The larger proportion of funds (58 per cent by number, 58 per cent by value; 299 grants; \u00a3109m) has been allocated to research and project support (equipment, university awards, strategic awards, and project and programme grants; Table 1, Annex C). Over the 20-year period, approximately three-fifths (61 per cent by number; 60 per cent by value; 314 grants; \u00a3114m) of Wellcome Trust funding for malaria research (excluding Wellcome Trust grants for infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs) has been allocated to UK institutions, whereas 39 per cent of funding (201 grants; \u00a375m) has been committed to non-UK-based malaria research (see Table 2 and Figure 3, Annex C). Of the 201 grants39 featuring non-UK based malaria research, 159 (\u00a347m) grants were based in low- and middle-income countries; 79 of these grants were fellowships totalling \u00a332m in grant funding (see Table 2, and Figure 3b, Annex B). 44. Several centres providing the facility for research and training on malaria and other tropical diseases have been a core part of the Wellcome Trust's capacity building strategy around malaria. financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008. 38 Excludes Wellcome Trust grants for infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs (52 grants, \u00a3120m). 39 Excludes the 40 Wellcome Trust grants for infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs.3.1.1 UK Wellcome Trust Centres for Research in Clinical Tropical Medicine 45. Wellcome Trust Centres for Research in Clinical Tropical Medicine provide an environment that enables clinicians and health professionals to pursue research and undertake clinical training in national and international public health and tropical medicine. In addition, they provide a UK base for researchers engaged in projects outside the UK and support exchanges between clinical scientists. There is also a close relationship between these UK centres and the MOPs (section 3.3). In 1995, the Wellcome Trust established four UK centres: the Wellcome Trust Bloomsbury Centres for Research in Clinical Tropical Medicine, comprising the LSHTM; UCL (Institute of Child Health)40; Institute of Psychiatry, London; Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry; and St George's University of London the Wellcome Centre for Clinical Tropical Medicine at Imperial College London41 with St Mary's Hospital the Liverpool Wellcome Trust Tropical Centre42 the Wellcome Trust Centre for Research in Clinical Tropical Medicine at Oxford.43 40 wbc.lshtm.ac.uk/ 41 www3.imperial.ac.uk/clinicaltropicalmedicine 42 www.liverpoolwttc.org.uk/ 43 www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/uk-centre3.1.2 Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology 46. Through its support of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology (WTCMP) at the University of Glasgow, the Trust has helped to develop UK capacity in malaria parasitology. The WTCMP was first established in 1987 as a Wellcome Trust Unit (the Wellcome Trust's contribution was \u00a31.1m) to study the molecular genetics of parasites, including Trypanosoma, Leishmania and Trichomonas, under the direction of Professor Andrew Tait and Professor David Barry. In 2002, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) team led by Professor Christian Doerig (now based at the Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Victoria, Australia) joined the WTCMP and in 2004, INSERM established the Malaria Research Unit. In 2006, the WTCMP co-located to the multidisciplinary Glasgow Biomedical Centre, and in 2008, after a successful bid for a Wellcome Trust Strategic Award, core support for the WTCMP was renewed (\u00a32.7m). In 2011, under the direction of Professor David Barry, malaria parasitology remained a key component of the research undertaken at the centre. 47. In addition, the WTCMP - together with the Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation within the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences (MVLS) at the University of Glasgow - hosts the European Virtual Institute for Malaria Research (EVIMalaR).44 EVIMalaR is a European Commission-funded network that combines 55 of the European Union's leading malaria research groups from 28 institutions with six leading African institutions, the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology from India and representation of the Australian Malaria Research Network. This virtual institute is directed by Professor Andy Waters, a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow. 44 www.evimalar.org48. Recently, research funded through EVIMalaR and three other EU projects45 led by Professor Christian Doerig (who still maintains strong links with the WTCMP) and Professor Andy Waters at the WTCMP has discovered that chemotherapy drugs originally designed to inhibit key signalling pathways (PAK-MEK) in cancer cells can also kill blood stages of the malaria parasite P. falciparum. This finding is expected to have major implications for future antimalarial drug discovery strategies.46 3.1.3 Wellcome Trust funding for the History of Medicine 49. Through its History of Medicine funding programme, the Trust has played an important part in supporting research into the history of malaria research in the UK and more broadly. Historians at the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, which was established at Oxford University in 1972, have conducted several studies on the history of the disease and its control, including the History of Malaria and Its Control in Twentieth-century East Africa and The History of Malaria in England. Other studies supported through Wellcome's History of Medicine grants include 'History of anti-malarial policy in colonial South India' (Queen Mary, University of London) and 'Stagnation and salvation: a cultural history of malaria in Rome and the Campagna, 1859-1939' (the Indian Institute of Technology). Such historically based studies provide new insights into our understanding of malaria today and the strategies that have been developed to address the disease over time. Such work provides an important context for the successes and failures in malaria treatment and prevention to date and helps to engage new audiences with the history of malaria and its relevance to today's world. In total, the Trust has contributed just over \u00a30.4m to history of malaria research over the past two decades. 45 AntiMal Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) Malaria Initiative, Biology and Pathology of Malaria Parasite Network of Excellence, and FP7 MALSIG. 46 Sicard A et al.

The WTSI was established in 1992 and was initially funded jointly by the MRC47 and the Wellcome Trust with a primary mission to map, sequence and decode the human genome and to further our knowledge of the genomes of other organisms. Since its inception, the Wellcome Trust has committed over \u00a3740m to the WTSI with \u00a38.8m (1 per cent) of this to fund malaria research (see Table 3, Annex C). 51. The UK's contribution to the Human Genome Project (HGP) was led by the WTSI, with one-third of the human genome sequenced there. The technological advances that facilitated the large-scale sequencing of the HGP have enabled scientists to sequence the genomes of numerous important human and animal pathogens, including those important to malaria. 52. In 1995, the Wellcome Trust made the decision to establish the Pathogen Genomics Programme at the WTSI (formerly known as the Pathogen Sequencing Unit48), led by Bart Barrell, to sequence the genomes of organisms relevant to human and animal health. Through this programme, the WTSI has played a leading role in: 47 The MRC contributed approximately \u00a324m to the WTSI for the period up to the end of 2002. Source: WTSI. 48 The Pathogen Sequencing Unit (PSU) was initially funded through individual grants and later through the Wellcome Trust Beowulf Genomics Panel. The Beowulf Panel no longer operates and the PSU has been renamed to the Pathogen Genomics Programme, which is funded through the WTSI.i. The first multicentre international basic science collaboration in the malaria field - the Malaria Genome Project49 (see Table 8, Annex C). The completion of this six-year project to sequence the genome of the P. falciparum parasite, by an international collaboration of scientists from the USA and the UK, was a major breakthrough in the fight against malaria. This landmark achievement was carried out between three sequencing centres: the WTSI (UK), the Institute for Genomic Research (USA) and Stanford University (USA).50 Results of the work were published in Nature in 2002.51 ii. The International Anopheles Genome Project, an international consortium of scientists that sequenced the complete genome of Anopheles gambiae - the principal vector of malaria in Africa, which transmits the parasite to humans - described in Holt et al. (2002),52 with revisions described in Sharakhova et al. (2007).53 The genome was sequenced and annotated by Celera and Ensembl - the latter being a joint collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the WTSI (UK). The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, Germany), the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB, Greece), the Institute Pasteur in Paris, the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, USA), and the Universities of Iowa (USA), Rome (Italy) and Notre Dame (USA) also contributed to the collaboration. 53. Completion of the genome sequences of A. gambiae and P. falciparum, together with the human genome, which was published in Nature in 200154 by the International Human Genome Consortium, has provided researchers with a detailed insight into the three components of the malaria transmission cycle (humans, parasites and mosquitoes) and new opportunities to tackle questions that could not have been easily addressed before. 49 The \u00a318.5m Plasmodium falciparum project was funded in the UK by the Wellcome Trust (\u00a38m) and in the USA by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund (\u00a34.9m), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (\u00a32.2m), and the US Department of Defense (\u00a33.4m). 50 Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute: chromosomes 1, 3-9 and 13; TIGR: chromosomes 2, 10, 11 and 14; and Stanford University: chromosome 12. 51 Gardner MJ et al.

Genome Biol 2007;8(1):R5. 54 International Human Genome Consortium. Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome. Nature 2001;409:860-921.54. The genome sequence of Plasmodium has enabled a better understanding of parasite adhesion and the proteins involved, including PfEMP1 and rifin proteins, host-parasite interactions, the pathological basis of malaria, and the development of immunity to the parasite. With advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics, these genomes have provided a catalogue of potential vaccine candidates and significantly reduced gene screening times: what once would have taken decades of work can now be completed within a couple of years. 55. In 2011, there were encouraging advances in the clinical applications of genomics at the WTSI. A protein interaction screening approach called AVEXIS (avidity-based extracellular interaction screen) discovered a component of human red blood cells - the basigin receptor - that seems to be crucial for the malaria parasite P. falciparum to complete its life cycle within the human body. P. falciparum relies on the basigin receptor to invade the cells by binding a protein, P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (PfRH5), to the receptor. Identification of the basigin receptor offers a potential new focus for vaccine development.55 The importance of this key discovery was confirmed in a paper published in the journal Nature Communications in December 2011.56 A team of scientists from the Jenner Institute57 at the University of Oxford, working with colleagues from the WTSI and KEMRI, demonstrated that a vaccine they have developed targeting a full-length PfRH5 induces an antibody response in animal models that is capable of neutralising all the tested strains of the P. falciparum parasite. The Jenner Malaria Vaccine Programme, led by Professor Adrian Hill, a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow, has been at the forefront of development of malaria vaccines and has pioneered the use of prime boosting vaccination strategies and conducted the first clinical trials using this regime.58 ,59,60 55 Crosnier C et al.

Nat Med 2003;9:729-35.56. The vast amount of data in biological databases generated by the WTSI and other genome centres has created a need for improvements in sequence technologies, methods of data storage and analysis tools to handle, organise, share, interpret and compare (comparative genomics) the information being generated. Through the WTSI, by providing open-source software, the Wellcome Trust is working to support malaria research groups across the world, especially in malaria-endemic countries. 57. In 2005, the Wellcome Trust (together with Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski, who leads the malaria programme at the WTSI) initiated the development of one of the world's largest resources for analysis of genetic susceptibility to infectious disease - the international Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network61 (MalariaGEN; Table 8, Annex C). MalariaGEN is a partnership of malaria researchers in 21 countries cofounded by the Wellcome Trust (the Wellcome Trust's contribution was \u00a34.3m62) and the Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative. The consortium is a data-sharing community of researchers across the globe that seeks to discover mechanisms of protective immunity to malaria. The consortium aims to play an important part in the Global Malaria Action Plan, which seeks to eradicate deaths caused by malaria by 2015. In 2009, MalariaGEN published the first genome-wide association study conducted in Africa.63 MalariaGEN reflects the Wellcome Trust's conviction that open access data and collaboration are fundamental to scientific advance. MalariaGEN is also part of the EVIMalaR network. 61 www.malariagen.net/ 62 The Wellcome Trust's initial contribution to MalariaGEN was through a Wellcome Trust programme grant worth approximately \u00a34.3m to Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski (Wellcome Trust AS400 grant number: 077383), 'Learning from human genome how protective immunity against malaria works' . 63 Jallow M et al. Genome-wide and fine-resolution association analysis of malaria in West Africa. Nat Genet 2009;41:657-65.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 29 28 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 58. The MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health (CCGH) is a joint research collaboration between Oxford University, the WTSI, the MRC Laboratories in the Gambia, and the MOPs in Thailand, Vietnam and Kenya. The CCGH acts as the MalariaGEN Resource Centre, providing scientific and operational support for MalariaGEN's research and training activities, with expert teams in sample and data management, informatics, statistics, ethics and programme management. The CCGH also supports the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network64 data-sharing network. 59. The decision to co-locate the European Bioinformatics Institute at the WTSI in 1996 has also contributed, in part, to building capacity to support the data infrastructure required to underpin malaria genetics research. The WTSI, together with the European Molecular Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute, developed the Ensembl65 web browser, which has been used for the annotation and analysis of vertebrate genomes since 2000, with an initial focus on the human genome. Since 2009, the Ensembl site has been complemented by the creation of a new resource, 'Ensembl Genomes',66 providing access to genome data from non-invertebrate species. Ensembl Genomes now includes data from malarial parasites (genus Plasmodium, available through Ensembl Protists), the malarial vector (Anopheles gambiae, available through Ensembl Metazoa) and the human host (in Ensembl), enabling the analysis of all three genomes through an integrated interface. 60. Wellcome has played a key part in the creation, development and upkeep of powerful open source genomic comparison and analysis tools, research resources and databases that are used by the international malaria research community, including (see Table 8, Annex C for details): Ensembl/Ensembl Genomes Artemis/Artemis Comparison The Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network aims to optimise the use of antimalarial drugs by providing quality-assured information on drug resistance through partnership with the WHO and research groups, national control programs and surveillance networks in over 20 countries. The network is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 65 www.ensembl.org/ 66 www.ensemblgenomes.org/3.3 Investment in research capacity building and infrastructure in malaria-endemic regions It is the fact you supported people where the problem was, and the Wellcome Trust got people to go out to where the problem was.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 The Trust has been flexible and understanding of that [the nature and difficulties associated with research in malaria-endemic regions] and has been in it for the long run. I think that is very important, the long-term support, and not just supporting when things go well, because things don't always go well. So it is that long-term support for people as well as the projects that has been a very important part of it.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 61. One of the Trust's major strengths is thought to have been its ability to build research capacity and fund research in malaria-endemic countries. Through its MOPs in South-east Asia and Africa, the Trust has made a long-term investment in research, which has proven to have a direct benefit on human health. Through the Trust's long-term investment, the MOPs have established themselves as world-leading centres for malaria and tropical disease-based research. They are responsible for several important discoveries and clinical studies that have delivered key proven and cost-effective interventions that continue to reduce the burden of malaria morbidity and mortality and feed directly into local and international policy (Table 7, Annex C). The programmes also have important international links, participating in research networks such as the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network and the Malaria in Pregnancy Consortium.62. The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, directed by Professor Kevin Marsh, is based in Kilifi and Nairobi, Kenya (see KEMRI case study and Table 7, Annex C).67 In 2010, the Wellcome Trust awarded \u00a332.5m to the Programme to support research activities through to 2015. Professor Bob Snow at the programme has spearheaded efforts through the Malaria Atlas Project to quantify the global burden of malaria and has begun to provide definitive maps of all malaria-endemic regions of the world. The Kenya Programme delivered the first comprehensive characterisation of severe malaria in African children, insight into the clinical features and neurological effects of malaria, and evidence supporting the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets. As one of the trial sites it played a part in bringing the potential malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S to phase III clinical trials. The first results from the ongoing phase III clinical trials, in which the Programme is also participating, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2011 and showed that RTS,S reduces the risk of malaria by half in African children aged from 5 months to 17 months. 63. Established in 1995, the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, directed by Professor Robert Heyderman, is the Trust's MOP in Blantyre, Malawi.68 Its current core grant of \u00a38.8m over five years was awarded after a site visit in January 2008. The Programme is primarily located at the University of Malawi's College of Medicine in Blantyre. A separate laboratory at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre forms an integrated research unit. The Programme also has field sites at the shore of Lake Malawi and in the Shire Valley. This allows scientists, clinicians and public health specialists to work together and respond to local health priorities. The Programme has strong links with the University of Liverpool and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and works closely with the Malawian Ministry of Health on Malawi's malaria control programmes. 67 www.kemri-wellcome.org/ 68 www.mlw.medcol.mw/64. The Programme has helped to advance malaria treatment and monitoring, notably through the development of the Blantyre Coma Score, a system that helps monitor children in malaria-induced coma. Other clinical research at the facility includes the identification of distinctive retinopathy unique to severe malaria (which could lead to improved specificity of clinical diagnosis), trialling of antimalarial therapies at different sites around the country, the evaluation of strategies to delay the emergence of resistance to antimalarial drugs and the description of the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria using a unique collection of post-mortem brain material. 65. The Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme based in Bangkok, Thailand, under the direction of Professor Nick Day, was established in 1979 by scientists from Mahidol University in Bangkok and the University of Oxford in the UK. The Trust has provided \u00a321.6m of funding to the Programme since 2005, including approximately \u00a33m of core funding each year. The Programme conducts research of direct benefit to communities throughout South-east Asia and beyond. Field research extends across Thailand and includes the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit in Mae Sot directed by Professor Francois Nosten. The Programme also includes the Wellcome Trust-Mahosot Hospital-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Collaboration, based in Laos, run in collaboration with Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane. 66. This MOP has made major contributions to the understanding and treatment of malaria worldwide. The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit pioneered the development, evaluation and introduction of ACTs and has optimised treatments for women during pregnancy. Researchers at the Programme have assessed the efficacy of antimalarial drugs in patients, conducted detailed clinical, pharmacological and parasitological assessments of emerging artemisinin resistance in Cambodia, and provided pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for antimalarial treatment.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 31 30 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 67. The Trust provided support for the Thailand Programme to conduct the largest randomised artemisinin trials in adults and in children; in 2005, Nick White (see case study) and colleagues published the results of the SEAQUAMAT (South-east Asian quinine artesunate malaria trial),69 which showed that artesunate (given by injection) reduced the mortality of severe malaria by more than one-third in adults. This subsequently formed the basis of the WHO's treatment guidelines for adults.70 This was followed by the Wellcome Trust-funded AQUAMAT (African quinine versus artesunate malaria trial) study71 - the largest ever clinical trial among patients hospitalised with severe malaria. The results of this trial led the WHO to revise its guidelines for the treatment of the disease in African children. Artesunate remains the first-line treatment for all severe malaria. 68. The Vietnam Research Programme and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit was established in Ho Chi Minh City in 1991 and in Hanoi in 2006 and is directed by Professor Jeremy Farrar. Professor Tran Tinh Hien, Vice Director of the Programme, has made seminal contributions to malaria research and had a major role in the development and assessment of the artemisinin derivatives over the past 25 years. He was one of the first clinicians to assess these drugs outside China and has continued to play a leading part globally in a broad range of infectious diseases. In 2010, Professor Hien was awarded the 2010 Mackay Medal (www.rstmh.org/awards/medals/medals-available-2010/donald-mackay-medal) by the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene for his ground-breaking work in infectious diseases in Vietnam for over 20 years, and in 2011 he was made an Honorary Member of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.72 The Wellcome Trust has supported the Programme for almost 20 years and its core support has been extended through to 2015. One of the core research areas at the Unit is monitoring and understanding drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax. The Vietnam Programme has made major contributions to researching malaria: 69 Dondorp A. South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT) group.

In the past ten years, the Wellcome Trust has introduced several programmes designed specifically to further strengthen research infrastructure and capacity in resource-poor regions. These programmes aim to complement work underway in many of the existing MOPs and build networks and links outside the 'North' . Although these have no specific research area focus, it is likely that newly trained researchers will work in research areas of local and national importance - and, hence, malaria. 70. The Health Research Capacity Strengthening initiative began with an agreement in 2004 between the Wellcome Trust and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) to commit \u00a310m each towards a joint programme to help strengthen the capacity for generating new health research knowledge within Kenya and Malawi and to improve evidence-based decision making, policy formulation and implementation. In Kenya and Malawi, priorities have been developed exclusively by a National Task Force - purposely without any predetermined direction from the funders - to meet local health research needs. This required the establishment of new grant-giving entities, and steady progress is being made. Organisations in both countries are now making awards using transparent, merit-based peer-review processes. 71. In 2009, the Wellcome Trust introduced its African Institutions Initiative73 to enroll African scholars and institutions as leaders in efforts to rebuild research capacity in Africa. A total of \u00a330m has been provided to seven African-led international consortia,74 which represent 51 African institutions in 18 countries, in partnership with research countries in Australia, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the USA and the UK. 73 The African Institutions Initiative was not included in our funding analysis because it was established in financial year 2009. The funding analysis covered Wellcome Trust financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008. The Health Research Capacity Strengthening initiative was also not included in our funding analysis. The funding analysis covered Wellcome Trust financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008. 74 The seven African-led consortia are: Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA); One Health Initiative, African Research Consortium for Ecosystem and Population Health; One Medicine Africa-UK Research Capacity Development Partnership Programme for Infectious Diseases in Southern Africa (SACIDS consortium); Research Institute for Infectious Diseases of Poverty (IIDP); Southern Africa Consortium for Research Excellence (SACORE); Strengthening Research Capacity in Environmental Health (SNOWS); and Training Health Researchers into Vocational Excellence in East Africa (THRiVE).72. The Wellcome Trust's Strategic Awards are also thought to have kick-started a period of sustained investment in research and training in Africa by responding to the needs of local researchers (several of which have been malaria focused), providing substantial funding to give talented researchers access to training and the experience needed to conduct research at a world-class level. Recipients of Strategic Awards include Professor Kevin Marsh, Director of the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (\u00a38m, to develop research capacity and leadership in East Africa) and Professor Brian Greenwood at the LSHTM (\u00a37m, towards the Malaria Capacity Development Consortium, or MCDC, to support training for African scientists to undertake high-quality malaria research in African universities). 73. The MCDC, which was established in 2008, is a partnership of four European and five African partners.75 The secretariat of the consortium, under the direction of Professor Brian Greenwood and Professor David Schellenberg, is hosted by the LSHTM. In 2008, the MCDC was awarded a Strategic Award (\u00a37m) to build on the successful doctoral and postdoctoral capacity development programme funded previously by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Gates Malaria Partnership.76 Today, this Wellcome Trust Strategic Award supports approximately 20 African PhD students. The MCDC has also received an award of $5m from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which will allow it to sustain the investment in the investigators who were previously trained through the Gates Malaria Partnership. 3.4 Support for multi-agency, cross-sector partnerships and collaborations The Trust certainly has made a contribution [to international collaborations]. You funded the first international collaboration to map the genome and then you did the functional genomics initiative.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on Malaria, April 2010 75 The four European partners are: Center for Medical Parasitology, University of Copenhagen; DBL - Centre for Health Research and Development, University of Copenhagen; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; and the LSHTM. The five African universities are: College of Medicine, University of Malawi (CoM), and the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, Blantyre, Malawi, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College, Moshi (KCMC), and the Joint Malaria Programme (JMP) Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana, Faculty of Medicine and School of Public Health, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, and the Ministry of Health, Uganda, and the Faculty of Medicine, Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop (University of Dakar), Senegal and the Ministry of Health, Senegal. 76 The Gates Malaria Partnership was funded by a BMGF award ($40m) to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2000. The Dakar meeting was very important; for me, that was the turning point for malaria research, that was the beginning, and the fact that Dr Varmus went to Dakar for a week and then went to Mali for a week had a huge impact.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on Malaria, April 2010 74. The Wellcome Trust has played an important part in several malaria-focused international cross-sector partnerships over the past two decades. As the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria's first Secretariat ( 1997-1999) , the Wellcome Trust had a crucial role in shaping the Initiative during its first few years of operation. The MIM, founded in 1997, is a coordinated international collaboration of individuals, funding partners and four self-governing institutions (the MIM/TDR,77 MIMCom,78 MR479 and the MIM Secretariat), tackling malaria through strengthening research capacity in Africa and increasing international communication and cooperation. 75. As the first coordinating member of the MIM, the Wellcome Trust helped to support the coordination of malaria research internationally and increased training opportunities for researchers in Africa. The infrastructure for African Centres put together by MIM motivated African scientists to maximise the use of resources.80 76. The NIH (under the direction of Dr Harold Varmus) convened the first MIM conference in Dakar, Senegal, in January 1997; this was thought to have been a key turning point in the fight against malaria. The MIM has become a pre-eminent international research collaboration - helping to build and support research capacity across the world (Table 8, Annex C). 77. With the emergence of resistance to artemisinin-based drugs, the need to pursue new pharmacological leads remains. Participating in public-private research collaborations has been an integral part of the Trust's efforts to catalyse action against artemisinin-resistant parasites. The Wellcome Trust has been working through several public-private partnerships to help accelerate drug development for malaria (Table 8, Annex C). 77 www.mimalaria.org/eng/aboutmim.asp#MIMTdr 78 The MIM internet communication arm. www.mimalaria.org/eng/aboutmim. asp#MIMTdr 79 Malaria Research Reference Reagent Resource Center. www.mimalaria.org/eng/ aboutmim.asp#MIMTdr 80 Review of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM).

The Wellcome Trust has led several initiatives to transform the drug discovery pipeline for malaria. It was a founding member of the PDP funders group (which also includes DFID, USAID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others) and is a member of the WHO Malvac Malaria Vaccine Group. It has also provided continued support for Medicines for Malaria Venture, which was established in 1999 as a PDP dedicated to delivering new affordable antimalarial drugs in malaria-endemic countries. In 2005, the Wellcome Trust and DFID made a joint commitment to provide \u00a310m each to MMV over five years (together providing approximately 18 per cent of MMV's funding). The Trust provided a further award of \u00a35m to MMV in 2011. Other MMV funders include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and several European development agencies. 79. To date, MMV has registered three medicines - Guilin's artesunate and Coartem\u00ae Dispersible and Sigma-tau's DHA-piperaquine. Another ACT, artesunate-pyronaridine, is awaiting regulatory approval by the European Medicines Agency. Coartem\u00ae Dispersible, a child-friendly form of the ACT Coartem, was developed by Novartis in partnership with MMV and launched in 2009. In the 11 years since its inception, MMV has built a robust pipeline of malaria drugs, including drugs to tackle P. vivax, comprising over 50 projects. Its importance was recognised by the Expert Group. The MMV has been extraordinarily successful, it has brought in academia and all the pharmaceutical companies so the Trust should take some credit for this; they have been very supportive. Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 80. Through a Strategic Translation Award, the Wellcome Trust supports the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD): Malaria Drug Discovery, a five-year partnership dedicated to identifying a preclinical small molecule to provide a single-dose treatment for malaria caused by P. falciparum and identifying a new treatment modality for P. vivax. 81 The Wellcome Trust, the Singapore Economic Development Board and the MMV pledged over \u00a310m to the Institute. Although NITD82 will manage the programme, they will also conduct research jointly with several institutions, including the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. A potential drug candidate, called NITD609, developed by the international collaboration has been approved as a preclinical candidate and is ready for phase I studies in humans. 81. The Dundee Drug Discovery Unit (DDU) based at the University of Dundee is also supported through a Strategic Translation Award. In 2006, with funding worth approximately \u00a38.1m, a group led by Professor Mike Ferguson and Professor Alan Fairlamb instigated a drug discovery effort with the aim of translating basic research discoveries into candidate drugs (for tropical neglected diseases) ready for clinical trials. 81 Wellcome Trust Strategic Translation Award (\u00a36.4m) to Professor Alex Matter, NITD. 82 The NITD is a public-private partnership between Novartis and the Singapore Economic Development Board that was set up in 2002.82. The funding has been used to appoint key personnel from the biotechnology sector and industry to lead the creation of a drug screening and medicinal chemistry operation of comparable capability to that found in a small company. Professor Paul Wyatt, Head of Drug Discovery, was recruited from Astex Technologies, and Professor Julie Frearson (who headed the screening facility) was attracted from Cambridge-based drug discovery company Biofocus Ltd (now BioFocus DPI, a Galapagos company). A compound library has now been amassed and the robotics for screening installed; the first assays were run during 2006. 83. In 2008, the Wellcome Trust's Seeding Drug Discovery Initiative awarded Professor Stephen Ward and Dr Giancarlo Biagini (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine) and Professor Paul O'Neil (Liverpool University) \u00a31.4m to develop inhibitors to a potential drug target in malaria - an enzyme known as alternative complex 1 (or PfNDH2), which is found in the electron transport chain of the malaria parasite P. falciparum.83 83 Wellcome Trust (Seeding Drug Discovery). 'Alternative complex I as a new drug target against malaria' was not included in our funding analysis as the award was allocated in Wellcome Trust financial year 2009. The funding analysis covered Wellcome Trust financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008. The 'Alternative complex I as a new drug target against malaria' grant was granted an extension in 2010 until 2011.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 35 34 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 84. In terms of addressing the global burden of malaria over the past two decades, the main impact has come from an improved understanding of how to measure, prevent and treat malaria in individuals using existing tools - predominantly in the field. 85. Increased R&D funding, enhanced global partnerships and coordinated efforts to control malaria (i.e. the Global Fund, MIM, RBM and MDGs) through scaled-up evidence-based interventions - such as insecticide-treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventative treatment in pregnant women, RDTs, and the diagnosis and treatment of infected persons with ACTs - are having an impact upon malaria morbidity and mortality. 86. In terms of the Wellcome Trust, as described in the previous section, its primary role has been through its contribution to research into measuring, preventing and treating malaria. Research conducted through the MOPs has provided evidence to support international policies for malaria control, including the use of insecticide-treated bednets84 ,85 and changes in treatment for both severe and uncomplicated malaria, which has led to the global adoption of ACTs as first-line treatment.86 ,87 Through its funding for UK basic research into malaria and through the MOPs, Wellcome has generated substantial on-the-ground research capacity, community links and scientific leadership in places where malaria is endemic and research can be integrated into national research and healthcare systems. 87. The Wellcome Trust's investment in basic biomedical, epidemiological and genetic research has also contributed to some of the most important breakthroughs in our understanding of malaria. In particular, the characterisation of the laboratory and clinical features of Plasmodium knowlesi - now recognised as a significant cause of the disease 84 Killeen GF et al.

The Wellcome Trust has also made major contributions to research that has dramatically changed the way malaria is assessed and treated, including research that has: established artesunate as the treatment of choice for severe malaria; developed pre-referral rectal treatment; defined the optimum methods of assessment; discovered mechanisms of action; defined antimalarial pharmacodynamics; led the field in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling, resistance modelling and clinical trial design; introduced ACT; and conducted pivotal early trials for all the currently available ACTs. 89. Despite this progress, malaria remains an endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries. Emerging resistance to artemisinin-based compounds, the lack of an effective vaccine, expanding and maintaining coverage of insecticide-treated bednet and indoor residual spraying programmes, the overdependence on pyrethroids (a class of insecticide) and the shortfall in resources mean that much more needs to be done to ensure sustained progress if the long-term goal of global eradication is to be achieved. Furthermore, ongoing global climate policy debates over the impact that climate change might have upon the epidemiology and global burden of malaria 88 The six Plasmodium species are P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. malariae and P. ovale.

Research conducted by the Malaria Atlas Project challenges this notion, however, suggesting any failure to reduce the malaria burden in the future would be difficult to attribute to climate change97 and concluding that effectively scaling up existing malaria control interventions could potentially outweigh the negative effects of global warming as much as ten-fold. 90. Through this review, several challenges for malaria researchers and their funders have emerged. The following challenges are by no means exhaustive and (as with any review or consultation) a different review, informed by consultation with different experts, might have reached a different set of conclusions and priorities. Nevertheless, we believe that by addressing some of the research needs highlighted - and by building on existing infrastructures, critical mass and collaborations - the Wellcome Trust and other funders will help to maximise the impact of malaria-focused research in reducing the burden of the disease. 4.1 Ensure continued support for underpinning research into basic immune and biological mechanisms What can be done with malaria parasites now, in the lab, is quite staggering, compared to what was possible ten, particularly 20 years ago, experiments were just beyond thought. Now, I think essentially if you want to do something with the rodent areas, you can do it, and I think that has transformed a lot of the understanding of the basic biology.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 95 Patz JA et al.

During the past decade, many of the advances in basic malaria research have opened doors and enhanced our understanding of both the basic biology of the parasite and the host-protective immune response. Breakthroughs include: the characterisation of the laboratory and clinical features of the Plasmodium species; in vitro culture, which facilitated research into the molecular biology of the parasite; the discovery of VAR2CSA antigens, which helped us to understand why pregnant women were susceptible; and, most recently, genome sequencing of all three organisms involved in the transmission of malaria - the parasite P. falciparum, the mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae and the human host. 92. Studies on the contribution of human genetic factors, most notably the sickle cell trait that offers protection against malaria, have provided insight into the nature of adaptation of human populations in malaria-endemic countries. Other human genetic polymorphisms providing a protective effect against malaria have been identified, including haemoglobin S, haemoglobin B, haemoglobin E, thalassaemias and glucose-6-phosphate.98 93. More recently, there has been substantial progress towards licensing the first malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S (also known as RTS,S/AS), developed by PATH MVI and GlaxoSmithKline (Timeline). The first set of results from a large-scale phase III trial of RTS,S, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,99 show that the malaria vaccine candidate provides significant protection against clinical and severe malaria to young African children. 98 Kwiatkowski DP.

Looking forward: speculations on the future of malaria researchPortfolio Review: Malaria | 37 36 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 94. The Expert Group identified several basic research areas where a focus by the Wellcome Trust and other key funders would make a substantial impact on our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, immunology and pathobiology of malaria, specifically: the basic biology of all species of the Plasmodium parasite, particularly P. vivax the basic metabolic functions of the Plasmodium species, including metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics the complex mechanisms underlying the immunobiology of malaria robust model systems to support human immunological research. 95. Human malaria is caused mainly by five species of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, two species of Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae), of which P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most virulent and responsible for most malaria infection globally.100 A sixth species, Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of long-tailed macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), can also infect humans. A detailed understanding of the biology of all these parasites is required to support the development of effective interventions in the long term. We have been thinking very much about models and P. falciparum but P. falciparum is only one species. We do need to think in the future of other species.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 96. Plasmodium parasites have complex life cycles with multiple stages. In the infective stage, known as the sporozoite stage, the parasites are transmitted to the human host with a vector (Anopheles mosquito) bite. In the pre-erythrocytic stage, the sporozoite undergoes many rounds of asexual divisions and matures into merozoites in the liver cells. During the erythrocytic stage, the parasites invade red blood cells as merozoites, where they undergo several stages of replication and development before invading new red blood cells; in the sexual stage, susceptible mosquitoes ingest infected blood (gametocytes) from the human host. The parasite completes its maturation inside the insect's gut, finally migrating to the mosquito's salivary glands because it is through the saliva that it will enter a new human host. In some Plasmodium species, such as P. vivax and P. ovale, the parasite has the ability to remain dormant in the liver of its host in a form known as the hypnozoite. 100 White NJ. Malaria. In GC Cook and A Zumia (ed.). Mansonis Tropical Diseases. 21st edn. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 2003. pp 1205-96.This dormant parasite stage in the liver can result in multiple relapses of infection and is the most enigmatic and least understood phase of the life cycle. 97. The Expert Group described a need for more research into the last phase of the parasite's life cycle - the sexual stage - given the importance of gametocytes in transmission. As elimination and eradication efforts ramp up, transmission-blocking vaccines targeting the sexual stage of the parasite will be important for reducing transmission in areas of low prevalence and to prevent the spread and development of parasites resistant to vaccines. This will require an improved understanding of basic gametocyte biology. 98. Much of the research effort against Plasmodium has been focused on P. falciparum101 (accounting for 45 per cent of total malaria R&D, compared to 3 per cent for P. vivax, in 2007-2009). Although P. vivax is less virulent than P. falciparum in terms of mortality, from a public health viewpoint it is highly significant - it is the most geographically widespread of the species. Worldwide, an estimated 130 to 390 million people are infected every year and 2.6 billion people are at risk of infection.102 ,103 Clinical relapses with debilitating effects can occur because of the liver hypnozoites.104 Primaquine is the only licenced drug available that can prevent such relapses (tafenoquine is still investigational), but its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. To prevent vivax malaria, the Expert Group identified three broad areas where increased research efforts are required: the P. vivax liver stages (exo-erythrocytic stage), the hypnozoite and other biological processes exclusive to P. vivax the biology of the vectors in sustaining P. vivax transmission and the ecological diversity of host-vector and host-parasite interactions (necessary to develop effective community-based interventions to disrupt the transmission of malaria) the mechanism of action of current anti-relapse drugs, particularly primaquine, and ways of optimising their safety and effectiveness (see section 4.3). 101 PATH.

In the last couple of years it has surfaced, it has caught people's attention and it is a growing field.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 99. Because of the complexity of the Plasmodium life cycle, the innate immune response to malaria is still poorly understood. Difficulty arises from Plasmodium's intimate relationship with the human host, its adaptability and its ability to evade the host immune response using sophisticated mechanisms (such as host erythrocyte modification and antigenic variability using cell surface proteins, such as PfEMP1,105 made by the var gene family). Furthermore, Plasmodium's several life stages make the selection of important antigens for a viable effective vaccine to malaria a huge challenge. One of the reasons why pathogenesis hasn't moved forward is that for Plasmodium falciparum, we think that cytoadherence is an important thing, and we know quite a bit about it, but we haven't been able to make that link with disease because it is a complicated system.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 100. The adaptability of Plasmodium species, in particular P. falciparum, is evidenced through the development of resistance to antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine resistance was first reported in 1961 (Timeline). Since then, the occurrence of resistance has increased for all antimalarials. More recently, artemisinin resistance has been reported in western Cambodia (Timeline). 101. Although many proteins involved in Plasmodium's lifecycle have been identified - including the host cell invasion proteins MSP1, AMA1,EBA-175, TRAP and CTRP and the host cell modification proteins PfEMP1, KAHRP and PfEMP2 - much still remains to be learned about the cellular and molecular biology underlying these mechanisms and the host immune response.106 ,107 If we are to develop effective drugs and vaccines to block these vital stages within Plasmodium's life cycle, it is essential to bridge the gaps in our understanding of the host immune response to malaria. 105 Smith JD et al.

Deciphering the Plasmodium genome and proteome has accelerated drug development by identifying those genes essential for Plasmodium to survive and those involved in the metabolic pathways of these complex host-parasite interactions. For example, the MEP (2-C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate) pathway has been identified as a new target for potential new antimalarials, including fosmidomycin.108 However, approximately 60 per cent of the 5400 P. falciparum genes still encode proteins of unknown function.109 103. Although the presence and components of many of the Plasmodium metabolic pathways can be predicted through genomic analysis using Plasmodium gene finding programmes such as PHAT, GeneFinder, GlimmerM and Hexamer, these can only generate gene function predictions110 and require further experimental and biological validation. The Expert Group emphasised that we still know very little about the basic metabolic functions of the Plasmodium species, including metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics. Given the potential that a greater understanding of the parasites' metabolic pathways can offer to malaria pathogenesis, the Wellcome Trust and other funders might consider how to support this area in the future. We know very little about the lipids, we know very little about the carbohydrates or the metabolics of the parasite and those are three areas which are not yet investigated in appropriate depth and we could be missing very substantial parts of very important information.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 104. The Expert Group emphasised the relative lack of understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the immunobiology of malaria, such as modes of action, reactivities of antibodies, the role of cytokines, activation of the host's natural defence mechanisms (innate immune factors) by Plasmodium antigens and identification of pertinent innate receptors, among others. The perceived lack of knowledge of the immunologic mechanisms was thought to be in part because of a lack of direct funding for basic immunology. In addition, there was a feeling that in recent years, immunologic research has focused on vaccine development. 108 Jomaa H et al. Inhibitors of the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as antimalarial drugs. Science 1999;285:1573-6. 109 www.plasmodb.org, version 5.4 110 Bahl A et al. PlasmoDB: the Plasmodium genome resource. A database integrating experimental and computational data. Nucleic Acids Res 2003;31(1):212-5.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 39 38 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 105. Another barrier thought to be impeding understanding of the host immune response is the absence of effective model systems to investigate human malaria and assess potential vaccine candidates.111 Research into the biology of malaria has relied on four species of rodent malaria (Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium chabaudi and Plasmodium vinckei), which have been used extensively to complement research on P. falciparum - the only human malaria parasite that has been successfully cultured continually ex vivo. A culture system is available for the blood forms of P. falciparum, which has greatly assisted drug and vaccine trials against these stages of this species. However, no culture methods are available for the stages of the parasite in the liver or for any of the other human malaria species. Although model rodent malaria systems are valued for the study of human malaria, it remains difficult to make inferences about human malaria based on their results. 106. More robust model systems - that not only mimic the human immune system but also allow experimental animal studies to interact closely with human infection studies - would be a valuable complement to basic research on the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of malaria. To this end, as in many areas of biosciences research, encouraging basic malaria researchers to collaborate with more clinical- and vaccine-focused malaria researchers would help to take the field forward. I have a plea, if we keep going with vaccines that we actually try to incorporate some basic track research alongside the vaccine. So if something fails you don't have to go right back to the drawing board, you have got a whole lot of basic research going on and actually that doesn't get funded, when research is going towards vaccines, what gets funded is just the vaccine but not the parallel work that is necessary.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 107. The Expert Group described a shift in culture and emphasis within the malaria research community - towards more translational research. In recent years, the proportion of global malaria R&D funding directed to product development has increased.112 Although the importance of translational research and the 'game-changing' part played by public-private partnerships (such as MMV) must not be 111 Langhorne et al. The relevance of non-human primate and rodent malaria models for humans. Malaria J 2011;10:23. 112 PATH. Staying the Course? Malaria research and development in a time of economic uncertainty. Seattle: PATH; 2011.underestimated, the Expert Group emphasised that sustaining their impact in the long term will require underpinning, basic research. The experts urged the Wellcome Trust and other key funders to maintain 'blue skies' research, through mechanisms such as the Investigator Awards scheme. There has been a step change, I think the public-private partnerships coming in have changed the landscape and I think everybody is now talking about translational research and people are getting their heads around what translational research actually means and doing some of that.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 I have a plea from the Trust's side not to stop the tap on the 'blue skies' research because if we stop that tap, the translational end would never happen.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 4.2 The importance of clinical research and clinical investigation I would like to support having more clinical investigations. The bureaucratic obstacles and the impediments are huge. They have become more expensive and more difficult, and as a result less and less people are doing it. Apart from the last clinical trial of vaccines, which still had a core base of large international organisations, very few people are doing clinical investigations any more.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 108. In recent decades, many of the most important impacts on human malaria morbidity and mortality have been achieved through clinical and intervention-based research. Current recommendations for the treatment and clinical management of uncomplicated113 and severe114 malaria in adults, children and individuals at high risk, particularly pregnant women (i.e. ACTs, intravenous artesunate and pre-referral rectal artesunate) have arisen from clinical investigations - of which the Wellcome Trust has been a key supporter over this time. 109. The Expert Group described concern over the limited number of clinical investigations currently underway, particularly in malaria-endemic regions. The perceived increasing number of obstacles confronting clinical 113 Uncomplicated malaria is symptomatic malaria with parasitaemia (<5 per cent of red blood cells infected) and no evidence of vital organ dysfunction. 114 Severe malaria is acute malaria with hyperparasitaemia (5-10 per cent of red blood cells infected).researchers - including costs, regulatory burdens, and patient participation and recruitment protocols - and the dearth of good morbidity and surveillance data are all thought to be adding to the complexities of conducting clinical investigations on malaria. 110. The Expert Group were in agreement that supporting capacity for clinical research is crucial if we are to continue to deliver improvements in human health and to complement the ongoing, high-quality basic science research effort. More resources should be given to understanding the pathology, physiology and pathophysiology of the disease. In terms of severe malaria in particular, given the complex pathophysiology of the infection involving multiple organ systems, the management of patients presents a broad range of clinical challenges. This is particularly true in endemic regions, where access to diagnostic and therapeutic tools may be limited. The Expert Group agreed that clinical research into the pathophysiology of acidosis, anaemia, renal failure and pulmonary oedema is likely to meet the clinical challenges associated with severe malaria and deliver patient benefits. 4.3 Ensure a pipeline of antimalarial drugs One of the things we must have in malaria is a pipeline of medicines, because the parasite is going to get resistant.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 We are using medicines but on a very flimsy knowledge base. We don't know enough about the work up to malaria, the pharmacokinetics and we are probably using the wrong dosing and so on. So there is a need to strengthen that knowledge base, which I think is an area that easily gets overlooked in the rush to use these tools.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 111. Despite the recent development of several new antimalarial drugs against P. falciparum (including artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine, Coartem\u00ae Dispersible for children and Pyramax\u00ae) and approximately 27 candidates in various clinical stages of development worldwide,115 the Expert Group felt it likely - if not inevitable - that the malaria parasite will develop resistance to these and other major drugs in the future. Furthermore, other Plasmodium species (particularly P. vivax) are likely to become more prevalent as control measures against P. falciparum become more effective. The Expert Group maintained 115 PATH. Staying the Course? Malaria research and development in a time of economic uncertainty. Seattle: PATH; 2011.that the least expensive and most effective research investment at present would be to optimise the dose regimens for currently available antimalarial drugs. One challenge for the future is to develop novel compounds to combat P. vivax and other emerging strains of Plasmodium. 112. The Expert Group discussed the implications of emerging and increasing resistance in malaria and emphasised the need for the development of a sustained pipeline of antimalarial drugs. A major threat to malaria control and eradication is the emergence of Plasmodium species that are resistant to the currently used artemisinins recommended by the WHO as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria in all malaria-endemic regions.116 ,117 The emergence of artemisinin resistance on the Thailand-Cambodian border,118 the risk of it spreading to other regions and the lack of replacement drugs for ACTs mean further investment in research to enhance understanding of drug resistance is needed. Access to quality-assured diagnostics, vector control, and monitoring and surveillance are also important in this (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6). 113. In summary, the Expert Group highlighted several priorities for malaria drug development and improvement: optimising dose regimens for currently available antimalarial drugs novel drugs to tackle other malaria parasites, particularly P. vivax, which will necessitate a clearer understanding of their resistance mechanisms significant investment in building malaria-focused pharmacology and pharmacokinetic research capacity the implementation of novel management systems to monitor the use of compounds in the field to protect the drug supply pipeline. 114. In terms of efficacy for antimalarial drugs, the Expert Group described a relative lack of detailed understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial drugs in human populations, particularly how human genetic variability and the mechanisms of absorption, elimination, distribution, biotransformation and metabolism lead to treatment failure, resistance and certain drug side-effects. The mechanism of 116 Nosten F, White NJ. Artemisinin-based combination treatment of falciparum malaria. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2007;77:181-92. 117 White NJ. Qinghaosu (artemisinin): the price of success.

Portfolio Review: Malaria | 41 40 | Portfolio Review: Malaria action of primaquine, the only 8-aminoquinoline in clinical use, is still not known, and it was highlighted as a priority drug (in terms of vivax malaria) for optimisation by the Expert Group. The perceived lack of progress in pharmacokinetics was thought to result from a lack of direct funding, a lack of understanding of the basic biological mechanisms and the lack of malaria pharmacologists in the field. The Expert Group recommended supporting research into the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs, particularly because of the key evidence such studies provide for determining optimal drug dosages, drug combinations and usage in a population, and distinguishing between treatment failure caused by resistance and by other causes, such as inadequate drug concentrations. Such information is essential to optimise treatment management and achieve effective delivery across all malaria-endemic regions. 115. The Expert Group discussed the limited amount of evidence available for policy makers to make decisions on how ACTs should be properly executed and deployed in the field. The crucial need for research on how to protect ACTs for as long as possible was emphasised. The ACT Consortium119 is currently looking at the effectiveness of ACTs over time, the cost-effectiveness of delivery strategies, acceptability, safety and how to improve ACT usage. 4.4 A need to expand the armoury of, and access to, quality-assured diagnostic testing It [diagnostic testing] will make a huge difference, for a variety of reasons. One is better clinical management, not only of malaria cases but the cases that are negative too. And the other is the use of medicines more rationally. All the indications are that we were over-treating malaria in children in Africa, so provided we have good diagnostic tools, these things will make a huge difference for the better. But we still have a huge challenge, to get quality diagnostic tools out there in the field and that is not a simple task, that is a massive challenge.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 119 www.actconsortium.orgRapid diagnostic tests. It is not high technology, but it has revolutionised how malaria is going to be managed, and if elimination does happen somewhere then its going to play a key part.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 116. In 2006, the adoption of ACTs as first-line treatment transformed the global treatment of malaria; however, if patients are misdiagnosed with malaria and incorrectly treated, these drugs may become ineffective. The prompt and accurate diagnosis of malaria is pivotal for effective clinical case management and control, to ensure appropriate drug treatment, and to prevent presumptive treatment of malaria, which is widespread in endemic areas. The availability of effective, high-quality diagnostic tools is key to facilitate this. 117. Historically, microscopy - diagnosis via microscope analysis - has been the main method of confirming a diagnosis of malaria. In most malaria-endemic regions, however, microscopy in a clinic setting is not practical. The development of RDTs, which require less equipment and training and can be used in the field, has made a massive difference to the clinical management of malaria. Malaria RDTs, also known as 'dipsticks' or 'malaria rapid diagnostic devices', were introduced in 1995 (Timeline) and have the potential to greatly improve the management of malaria infections when a high-quality microscopy diagnosis is not readily available. 118. The introduction of RDTs (followed by the endorsement of the WHO and inclusion in their guideline on universal diagnostic testing120 ,121) before being treated was identified as a major step change in the clinical management of malaria. Over the past few years, the number of RDTs available, the interest in scaling-up diagnosis and the number of new diagnostic screening tools in development - based on technologies such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, PCR, digital microscopy and serology - has rapidly increased.122 120 WHO. Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. 2nd ed. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2010. 121 RDTS detect malaria antigen in a drop of human blood. One example is histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), which is specific for P. falciparum. 122 PATH. Staying the Course? Malaria research and development in a time of economic uncertainty. Seattle: PATH; 2011.119. Although the Expert Group acknowledged the important role of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics123 and WHO in driving the development and implementation of high-quality diagnostic tests in malaria-endemic countries, and although African countries and other regions124 are currently deploying RDTs in the community setting, the Expert Group emphasised that accurate malaria diagnosis in remote low-resource areas still remains a major issue. 120. Malaria RDTs used in remote and low-resource areas face more challenges than those used in the traditional laboratory setting: the plethora of issues - such as thermal stability, sensitivity and specificity (which depends on parasite density, the population tested, the preparation and interpretation of the RDTs, and the quality of the reference standard), transport, sample collection and storage, shelf life, variability and community-level diagnosis - mean malaria RDTs used in the field need to be more robust, and quality assurance is more difficult to implement and maintain. Therefore, achieving high-quality diagnosis in the field is a huge challenge because the planning and financial resources for training, monitoring and quality control programmes must be adequate. As a result, there is currently a lack of RDT accuracy and reproducibility in the field setting. 121. In working to reduce the clinical impact of malaria, it is essential to have quality-assured RDT-based diagnosis, reporting, screening and monitoring of incidence rates to inform national malaria programmes of the effectiveness of control strategies. The role of healthcare professionals in this is also crucial; appropriately trained community healthcare workers are essential to ensure RDTs are prepared and interpreted accurately. 122. More research is required to evolve and improve the range of RDTs, including the development of novel low-cost diagnostics that can detect very low levels of malaria parasites in asymptomatic individuals, and to support their availability and access in testing in low-resource settings. RDTs have some huge challenges to face and quality assurance of these tests is proving to be much more difficult than we thought.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 123 www.finddiagnostics.org 124 Sixteen African countries are deploying RDTs at the community level, as are 22 countries in other regions. WHO. World Malaria Report. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2010.4.5 A need for improved and novel vector control tools 123. Prevention of malaria transmission by the Anopheles vector is one of the fundamental measures of the Global Malaria Control Strategy.125 Key interventions currently recommended for vector control include the use of insecticide-treated bednets, long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, insecticide-treated materials and integrated vector management.126 ,127,128,129 Field trials of insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual spraying have demonstrated that they are most effective when applied with high coverage rates.130 ,131,132 However, the combination of logistical challenges associated with the distribution of insecticide-treated bednets and the rise of insecticide resistance threatens to undermine the effectiveness of treated bednets.133 Furthermore, the dependence on a single class of insecticides - the pyrethroids - in bednet impregnation makes insecticide resistance more likely; therefore, the development of new insecticides is crucial. 124. The Expert Group raised and discussed several research needs for the future of malaria vector control, specifically: More research into vector biology, to support the discovery of alternative insecticides to pyrethroids and new vector control tools including, for example, the potential to genetically modify mosquitoes that would be resistant to malaria and drive out natural malaria-carrying mosquitoes. A better understanding of how community health services can be best mobilised to implement measures such as insecticide-treated bednets and 125 WHO. A Global Strategy for Malaria Control.

Studies have shown that removing the costs to recipients for insecticide-treated bednets reduces inequity and increases coverage,134 although there are variations and more research is needed to explore how best to identify and access marginalised communities. A greater understanding of the optimum uses and applications of the range of vector control methods that exist. For example, the use of indoor residual spraying alone should be compared with its use in combination with insecticide-treated bednets. One of the main challenges of any malaria control programme is sustaining the effort involved, particularly when low levels of malaria have been achieved. The Expert Group argued that an increased capacity to scale-up and improve the maintenance of existing vector control measures and ensure their regular and proper use is essential. Currently, the total resources available to scale-up recommended vector control interventions fall short of what is needed. Another challenge is the relative lack of senior entomologists working in the field and the limited pipeline of trained junior researchers entering the field. There is an opportunity for funders - including the Wellcome Trust - to consider how to support capacity building and training strategies to address these gaps within the malaria research community. 125. In the area of vector control, the Expert Group emphasised the potential of collaborations between industry and academia to develop effective insecticides and consider the development of a supply of effective vector control tools. The group cited the example of the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC, which was funded by the Gates Foundation with an initial award of $50.7m and established in 2005) as a potential model to follow.135 Initially established as a research consortium, the IVCC has evolved into a PDP and registered as a not-for-profit company and charity in 2008. IVCC's aim is to \"enable partnerships for the accelerated development and delivery of new products and tools that increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the control of insects which transmit disease\". By bringing together relevant expertise and technical resources from across sectors, the IVCC hopes to transcend the barriers that have blocked innovation in the development of vector control products. 134 Noor AM et al. Insecticide treated net coverage in Africa: mapping progress in 2000-2007. Lancet 2009;373:58-67. 135 www.ivcc.com/index.htm4.6 Enhanced information systems, tools and technologies Even more important than modelling is the impact of GIS and that kind of technology on disease control. That is a field that has grown hugely - the geographic measuring systems. But its application and control has been dismal. This is an area where I think there is a huge gap. I wouldn't put my money on modelling; I would put it on getting better information systems.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 There is a big gap in what I might call monitoring, evaluation research...We are going to end up with problems, because we are not getting the right large scale feed through of information of what is going on in these large scale programmes. Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 It is becoming more and more important to recognise the focality of malaria, we have known it all along, but it is an area where we haven't put any practical value to. Even in high transmission areas like Africa, the straw that breaks the back of this camel is going to be focal and local malaria, which we are not looking at.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 The epidemiologists as well, they are very important too. What Bob Snow has done in the Malaria Atlas Project revolutionised it.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 126. Surveillance of malaria incidence and mortality is essential for monitoring the progress of malaria control programs nationally and internationally, and for recognising malaria focality - which is vital for malaria immunisation and transmission control. As important as having high-quality diagnostic tools for malaria is the need to capture accurate malaria incidence data across populations.127. The Expert Group described a dearth in accurate malaria surveillance systems. This has perhaps become more acute over time: although funding via large prevention programmes is thought to be responsible for major reductions in the burden of malaria in many areas, the ability to precisely model and quantify those reductions remains difficult. The Expert Group described the continuing importance of 'shoe-leather epidemiologists', who are crucial in building the picture of malaria incidence by personally tracing every contact, in resource-poor settings. To have people adequately trained in the capture of high-quality data and in interpreting and mapping incidence using reliable health information and surveillance systems is a priority. 128. This has been further highlighted in a recent study, led by researchers at the IHME, which indicated that malaria mortality data is possibly double previous estimates by WHO for 2010.136 Such large variation in incidence estimates emphasises the limitations of existing data sources for assessing malaria mortality over time and underscores the need to improve methods for future estimates of malaria disease burden. 129. Geographic information systems (GIS) and technology-based surveillance support tools are being used increasingly to map and model the incidence and prevalence of malaria across parts of the world. However, such mapping technologies can only be used effectively where the underlying incidence data are reliable and complete, where there is adequate information infrastructure, and where staff are trained to interpret the data; in many resource-poor and malaria-endemic settings, none of these criteria for the success of GIS-related technologies are fulfilled. 130. Investments to help build a cadre of researchers to deliver high-quality surveillance and epidemiology are crucial, as are technology and information systems to support surveillance. Consequently, it was recommended that support should be provided to address the gap in health information systems. This, again, is an area where collaboration between researchers, information technology providers and industry could have a major impact. 136 Murray CJL et al. Global malaria mortality between 1980 and 2010: a systematic analysis. Lancet 2011;379(9814):413-31.4.7 Integrated databases to enable research data sharing Getting people to put their data into shared databases as early as possible, I think that would transform the way research is done in the field, to get data out, to share and properly archive databases.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 This is a host parasite vector interface and if we really are going to understand the complexity of the disease, then we are going to have to, at some stage, do something akin to a systems biology approach that is able to handle all of those information streams, and that is a huge challenge.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 131. Since the sequencing of the human genome, the malaria community has embraced the principles of open access for malaria research data. In the fight against malaria, data are highly significant - from genomic sequencing data on pathogen and vectors to serotypes and incidence data. 132. Several genome-based databases with a focus on malaria parasites already exist, such as PlasmoDB137 and Vectorbase,138 but these are not currently integrated; the Expert Group extolled the potential benefits of having shared, publicly accessible databases. Although the development of integrated databases would be a huge challenge, bringing together diverse data sets from the host, parasite and vector research communities is likely to yield several benefits, including: enabling the exchange of robust information (both positive and negative) between the host, pathogen and vector communities facilitating data sharing between basic and clinical scientists enabling the malaria research community to share clinical trial data enabling the efficient exchange of immunology data helping to facilitate a systems biology approach to malaria research providing a deeper understanding of the complex host-pathogen system increasing the speed at which new drugs are developed. 137 Aurrecoechea C. PlasmoDB: a functional genomic database for malaria parasites. Nucleic Acids Res 2009;37(suppl. 1):D539-43. 138 A cloning vector sequence database.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 45 44 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 133. There is a precedent for such collaboration within the malaria community, as evidenced in the P. falciparum database MapSeq/pf.139 MapSeq/pf is a database of genome variation in the malaria parasite P. falciparum in populations around the world, which enables the interrogation of more than 300 genomes simultaneously. Malaria researchers around the world have contributed samples and data to the MapSeq/pf project. The MapSeq/pf project is primarily funded by the Wellcome Trust, which is currently bearing most of the sequencing costs. MapSeq/pf also receives funds from other bodies, notably the MRC, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the NIH in the USA. 134. The development of any public, integrated database necessarily requires management, curation and associated governance and access policies to ensure researcher confidence in the data. To do this requires adequate investment in infrastructure and the training of database managers, systems analysts and other information technologists. We do need more database managers and database curators who are going to be able to look after these [shared databases].Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 In relation to databases, we are going to need systems analysts to distinguish them from modellers, as a group. We are going to need those and they are going to need the infrastructure, which is non-existent, to get them started. I think that is something we do have to look to.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 4.8 A need to strengthen research capacity and support training One of the problems is that, for a lot of young African scientists, there are lots of PhD programmes and ways to train, but there is actually nothing to go back to, other than the Wellcome Trust type units. And that is not enough.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 When you are getting down to these more unusual situations with things not working, it is going to be absolutely critical to have competent entomologists and they really have just gone.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 139 www.sanger.ac.uk/MapSeq/135. The Expert Group agreed that the future of malaria research will involve improving the current tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment and developing new approaches to combat the disease. To do this requires a focus on both short-term and long-term capacity development - both human and infrastructure and systems capacity. In the short term, it is essential that researchers are equipped with the training to enable them to use existing tools and knowledge effectively. In the longer term, it is important that there are sufficient highly skilled researchers and technicians across all aspects of malaria research. 136. As described, researchers to help us understand and combat malaria are required in several traditional and emerging disciplines. The Expert Group described a relative shortage of junior malariologists and those specialising in parasitology, immunology, pathology and pharmacology. Researchers with skills in community and health services research are important to aid in the development of effective prevention and treatment delivery programmes and to work with governments and healthcare providers in endemic countries. In addition, there is an emerging need for bioinformaticians and information science researchers to complement the work of basic-focused malaria researchers. 137. The Expert Group commended the research and capacity-strengthening activities of the Wellcome Trust in Africa, such as the Health Research Capacity Strengthening Initiative and the African Institution Initiative, which has a significant focus on the training and mentorship of junior researchers. In addition, the Expert Group emphasised the need for improved coordination between the researchers working in the field in endemic countries and their international counterparts to ensure that research findings and expertise are shared, to maximise the opportunities for collaboration and minimise the potential for duplication.138. Interestingly, although the benefits of 'big', collaborative science on the global burden of malaria are thought to be substantial, the need to ensure that science organised in this way does not negatively affect a junior researcher's career remains a challenge. Working collaboratively within consortia on a subject like malaria can deliver timely results and avoid duplication; however, it is argued that consortia can restrict scientific independence and limit career paths for young researchers. This issue is not unique to the field of malaria, but its potential impact is perhaps more acute given the need to sustain a pipeline of researchers to prevent the progress made to date being reversed; it remains crucial that new researchers are attracted to work in the field. It was agreed that it is the responsibility of institutions moving towards collaborative 'big science' to have career development strategies in place for the younger generation of malaria researchers coming through. What we are missing from the vector biology community is senior and mid-senior level people, we lost a generation and we have a tiny number of people who are now trying to mentor others coming through and it is an almost impossible task.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 4.9 A recognition of the importance of international, multi-sector collaborations to tackle malaria If malaria hadn't got into the Global Fund we would still be struggling around.Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 139. Over the past decade or so, several international collaborations, public-private partnerships and PDPs have been established to combat malaria. The focus of these collaborations has ranged from basic science (the focus of the Malaria Genome Project) to the delivery of vaccines and drugs in malaria-endemic regions (the focus of PATH MVI). These collaborations are thought to be making a crucial difference in the effort to combat diseases because they bring together relevant experts that are required to address the complexities of disease treatment and prevention.140. PDPs bring together public sector funding with private sector funding and manage the contributions towards a common objective. The majority of PDPs work as non-profit organisations, whereby activities are outsourced to academic or private sector partners, with the PDP bringing together expertise and providing public funding, technical oversight and portfolio management. Each PDP focuses on specific types of technologies (e.g. drugs, vaccines or diagnostics), and some PDPs limit themselves to a specific disease area.140 141. Established in 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (often called 'the Global Fund') is an international public-private partnership organization that aims to \"attract and disburse additional resources to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria\". The Global Fund has been the world's largest financier of anti-AIDS, TB and malaria programs and at the end of 2010 had approved funding of $21.7bn that supported more than 600 programs in 150 countries; the Expert Group emphasised the important role of the Global Fund in helping to bring money to the field of malaria over the past decade. The global financial crisis has severely dented the availability of funding via the Global Fund, which has since decided to cancel round 11 of grant funding.141 142. The Expert Group recommended that public, private and philanthropic funders should continue to seek out opportunities to work together to minimise the risk of over-reliance on one funder or sector and to ensure a well-balanced, diverse, responsive and flexible portfolio of malaria-related research funding across the globe. I think the R&D funding has largely been dissociated from the Global Fund, up to now. We are in the middle of the Global Fund, resources have been spent on research and in some ways, the biggest threat to malaria is the possibility of the Global Fund drying up; 'drying up' is too harsh a word, but there is a huge threat. There is a possibility that they will not be able to sustain this funding. Wellcome Trust Expert Group on malaria, April 2010 140 DfID. 2010.

Looking ahead, the Trust and other funders of malaria-related research need to continue to engage with the social, political and ethical implications of research. To ensure global funds for malaria R&D are coordinated effectively and used to their best effect, funders need to maintain an active, open dialogue. 144. Research diagnosis and treatment regimens necessarily carry with them a need to consider patient benefit. Research that involves the participation of individuals from low- and middle-income countries - and where patient benefit may not be immediate - raises important ethical considerations around issues including informed consent and benefit sharing. Such research must always respect the cultural and social context. 145. In addition, many of the barriers to the implementation of malaria research findings and recommendations are political and economic. A key challenge for the Wellcome Trust and other funders and partners in malaria research support is to ensure that interventions of demonstrated effectiveness are taken up into health policy and practice at the local and global level; research findings can be difficult to translate easily and immediately into resource-poor settings. Funders also need to work to ensure that malaria drugs can be made available to those most in need at affordable prices and to address the growing problem of counterfeit medicines. Funders need to continue to explore mechanisms by which they can support researchers and other organisations to ensure the maximum utility of research in practice. 146. It is important in going forward with malaria research that such contexts and considerations are not lost in the pursuit of knowledge. 4.11 To support dialogue with relevant policy and public stakeholders 147. The Expert Group emphasised the importance and value of raising public awareness of the problems of malaria and the continued need to deliver public awareness campaigns. Like many aspects considered in this review, it is something that has become more prominent in recent years. 148. Public engagement activities play a major part in increasing the impact of malaria prevention and control strategies, and international campaigns such as RBM, United Against Malaria142 and World Malaria Day143 are needed to inform, enhance and sustain the delivery of malaria control strategies to achieve universal coverage and eventual elimination. 149. Public consultation, participation and open dialogue, upstream in the research process, ensure the development of appropriate, culturally relevant technologies. Continued public discussion can generate a bottom-up demand for such interventions. Engagement activities along with cultural and social research can help determine the most appropriate way to engage with particular communities, to conduct research and to design health promotion strategies. 150. Through its international engagement work, the Trust stimulates dialogue about health research and its impact on the public. Furthermore, all Wellcome Trust MOPs are encouraged to have community engagement or communications staff to facilitate interactions between researchers, local communities, policy actors and the media. 142 unitedagainstmalaria.org/ 143 www.worldmalariaday.orgPortfolio Review: Malaria | 49 48 | Portfolio Review: Malaria Dr Gerry Killeen: Mosquito control Summary Reducing mosquito numbers and avoiding mosquito bites are key to reducing malaria transmission. The Anopheles gambiae mosquito is the main transmitter ('vector') of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and so is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other animal. Dr Gerry Killeen has conducted field research in Africa since 2000, working to identify new ways to control the mosquitoes that transmit malaria and better ways to use current methods. Background The World Health Organization's malaria control strategy emphasises the importance of targeting a range of vectors using a combination of interventions - including distributing insecticide-treated bednets, spraying insecticides indoors and killing insect larvae. But implementing and maintaining effective vector interventions on a large scale can be challenging. A range of coordinated, evidence-based interventions are needed to break the malaria transmission cycle at a local level. High-quality field-based research by well-trained local scientists is crucial to achieving this, and novel complementary interventions are needed to eliminate malaria transmission in endemic areas. Dr Gerry Killeen works to identify, develop and validate appropriate vector control tools that will be effective in parts of Africa where malaria is endemic and resources scarce. His work promotes evidence-based policy and will help to ensure the most effective strategies are implemented, quickly. A biochemist, Dr Killeen started developing mathematical models of malaria transmission during his postdoctoral research at Tulane University in New Orleans. Inspired by F L Soper's quest to rid north-east Brazil of the A. gambiae mosquito, he moved to East Africa - first Kenya, then Tanzania. Since 2000 he has conducted field research, mostly in isolated rural settings, working with the Ifakara Health Institute and the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology. He holds a Readership at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and leads the Biomedical and Environmental Thematic Group at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. Since being awarded a Wellcome Trust Intermediate Fellowship in 2005, Dr Killeen has modernised and validated Soper's neglected vector control strategy, first used more than 50 years ago. He now hopes to make further improvements and roll it out on a large scale. Advance Dr Killeen realised that currently used insect-trapping methods (principally human landing catch trapping, which is labour-intensive and exposes the collector to the risk of malaria infection) were unsuitable for monitoring mosquito behaviour on a large scale. He tested a series of tent traps that could provide an affordable, practical and informative trapping method. Since validating this method, he has used it in a variety of field studies to monitor mosquito behaviour in urban Dar es Salaam, as well as in Ifakara and other parts of rural Tanzania. His research has revealed that bednet use and indoor spraying were changing the behaviour of the insect vectors and forcing them to feed outdoors. This demonstrated the need for novel interventions that target larval stages to complement indoor vector control measures targeting adult mosquitoes. Free distribution of insecticide-treated bednets to reduce malaria transmission is a high priority for national malaria control programmes. However, in most countries only vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women are being targeted. In 2007 Dr Killeen published research to show that complete coverage of the whole population, not just vulnerable groups, with insecticide-treated bednets was necessary to have a significant impact on malaria disease burden. The evidence provided by Dr Killeen's study led directly to rapid changes in WHO guidelines for bednet distribution, emphasising the need for over 80 per cent coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in national malaria control programmes. In Dar es Salaam, mosquito surveillance and control in the Urban Malaria Control Programme is delegated to community members known as community-owned resource persons (CORPs). Dr Killeen and colleagues from the Ifakara Health Institute, Durham University, Harvard University, the Swiss Tropical Institute and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine have developed a programme of community-based surveillance and larviciding (killing larvae) in 15 urban wards covering 55 km 2 of Dar es Salaam. One study closely monitored inoculation rates and malaria infection prevalence for a year. This revealed that larviciding as an adjunct to existing insecticide-treated bednets reduced malaria transmission by 72 per cent. Dr Killeen now plans to modernise the intervention further to make use of locally available technologies, such as mobile phone reporting, and to integrate local management and evaluation teams so the intervention can be scaled up to a multi-country trial. Dr Killeen is committed to working in low-income countries and applying basic science to practical programmes that will affect the lives of millions of people. Central to this is his desire to build research capacity and nurture local scientific talent. Several of his students have been successful applicants to the Trust's Master's Fellowship scheme, and this has helped to provide the incentive needed for young Africans to compete at the highest level. The research base Dr Killeen has established in Tanzania helps to build local research capacity, boasting a team including 20 Kenyan and Tanzanian postgraduate researchers, three postdoctoral researchers and two academic staff (including Dr Killeen). His goal is to develop not only the technologies and knowledge but also the expertise and training base that Africa will need to eliminate malaria in the long term.References Russell TL et al.

Wellcome ImagesPortfolio Review: Malaria | 51 50 | Portfolio Review: Malaria Professor Nick White: On the front line of the fight against malaria Summary Professor Nick White has been a key figure in developing and validating effective treatments for malaria, including widespread use of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs. His extensive research has provided the evidence to support changes in treatment for both severe and uncomplicated malaria and has led to the introduction and global adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Now, as artemisinin resistance begins to emerge, he is well placed to face the new challenges in the fight against malaria parasites. Background Professor White has lived and worked in South-east Asia for almost 30 years. His career in malaria research began in earnest when, in 1980, he was awarded a lectureship in tropical medicine funded by the Wellcome Trust and moved to work in Thailand with the Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme. He became Director of the Programme in 1986 and Chairman in 2001. In 1991, he founded the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam. Professor White has been a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow since 1992. He is Professor at both Mahidol and Oxford Universities and an Honorary Consultant Physician at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and he sits on several World Health Organization (WHO) advisory panels.The Programme in Thailand has, from the outset, focused on clinical research relevant to improving patient health. It has played a key part in building local research capacity by training clinical scientists from across the region and building world-class clinical research infrastructure. Research activity within the programme has led to fundamental improvements in the health of people living in Thailand and other parts of South-east Asia, as well as further afield. Professor White's contribution to these achievements has been recognised in a number of awards, including an OBE. He was also identified as the world's third most influential malaria researcher in a survey of citations in publications between 1995 and 2005. And in a survey of papers published between 1996 and 2007 by European parasitologists, he was by far the most highly cited researcher. Advance Professor White's malaria research has examined the disease-causing characteristics of the malaria parasite and how antimalarial drugs work. In the 1980s, Professor White established the correct dosage regimens for severe malaria drugs. In the 1990s, he went on to develop the theoretical basis for assessing antimalarial drugs in patients and how they could be adapted to field conditions. This led, through a series of large clinical trials, to the development of optimum treatment regimens for drug-resistant malaria and ultimately artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), the current first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria throughout the world. As a result of the widespread use of ACTs, deaths from malaria in Vietnam have dropped from around 1500 per year in the 1990s to around 100 each year now. And since the introduction of ACTs to refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, cases of malaria within the camps have fallen by 90 per cent. Professor White's team of Trust-funded researchers developed and tested the use of ACTs in the 1990s. They carried out extensive clinical trials to test the effectiveness of different artemisinin derivatives given in combination with additional antimalarials such as mefloquine. They found that artemesinin derivatives were highly effective at killing P. falciparum parasites and caused fewer side-effects than existing antimalarials. Professor White and colleagues have also carried out some of the largest clinical trials in the world to test the effectiveness of artesunate, a water-soluble derivative of artemesinin that can be injected. These trials have been key to driving changes from quinoline-based medications to ACTs. In a worrying development, they have also provided the first comprehensive evidence that artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum parasites are circulating in Cambodia; the team is developing novel methods to detect these. In light of this and new evidence that fake artemisinin drugs are being circulated, Professor White's research teams are developing methods to detect and tackle counterfeit and substandard antimalarial medicines. They are also looking for new and more effective antimalarial medications. Elsewhere, Professor White and colleague Fran\u00e7ois Nosten have demonstrated that women in late pregnancy are being systematically under-dosed with current antimalarial treatments. His clinical studies have shown that artemisinins are safe for use during pregnancy. These findings have led to changes in recommendations for antimalarial treatment during pregnancy. He and his colleagues have also developed mathematical models to quantify the impact of different antimalarial treatment choices and implementation strategies. The models have provided a useful tool to inform the design of treatment policies. Clinical teams within the Wellcome Trust Programme have made comprehensive descriptions of severe malaria that have provided the basis for the first WHO severe malaria management guidelines. And, in a landmark paper published in 2005, researchers from the Programme showed that treatment with artesunate reduced mortality by 35 per cent compared with quinine treatment. In 2010, in the largest ever study in severe malaria (AQUAMAT), Professor White's team showed that artesunate reduced the mortality of severe malaria in African children by 22 per cent compared with quinine.References Hutagalung R et al.

Wellcome Library, LondonPortfolio Review: Malaria | 53 52 | Portfolio Review: Malaria Professor Chris Newbold: Malaria and immunity Summary For more than 20 years, Professor Chris Newbold has studied antigenic variation in the malaria parasite and how it contributes to host immunity and parasite virulence. A key contributor to the Malaria Genome Project, his team was also the first to clone genes for the variant antigen var, now known to be central to the Plasmodium falciparum parasite's pathogenicity. His work drove a sea change in thinking about malaria and how immunity to the parasite develops. Background Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent malaria parasite species that infects humans and is responsible for 1-2 million childhood deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone. For more than 20 years, Professor Newbold has been interested in antigenic variation in the parasite. Following postdoctoral research at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, he moved to the University of Oxford in 1984, becoming Professor of Tropical Medicine in 1997. The Wellcome Trust's support for malaria research has been key to his research. Trust programmes such as the Functional Genomics Development Initiative have helped Professor Newbold and his collaborators to characterise key molecular components of the parasite that drive its invasion into host red blood cells. The malaria-mapping project laid the foundations for the P. falciparum genome-sequencing Malaria Genome Project, which began in 1996 with funding from an international consortium that included the Trust. Professor Newbold holds an honorary faculty position at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, which has been at the core of his work to understand gene regulation in the parasite for many years, and he played a key part in establishing basic science research at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kilifi, Kenya. Advance Professor Newbold had a key role in the Malaria Genome Project, acting as coordinator for its UK arm. The impact of the Project, completed in 2002, is hard to overstate. The Nature paper containing the annotated sequence has been cited more than 1800 times. The sequence data have transformed the research field and enabled and encouraged many young investigators to develop new ideas to address some of the seemingly intractable questions facing malaria researchers. Plasmodium species sequencing projects continue to form a significant element of Professor Newbold's research as comparisons between related species improve our understanding of the function of different Plasmodium genes. The Trust-funded Functional Genomics Development Initiative followed soon after the Malaria Genome Project and enabled Professor Newbold and his colleagues to identify the molecular machinery that allows the parasite to invade host red blood cells. A number of these molecules, including a calcium-dependent protein kinase, are being characterised and investigated in the hope that specific inhibitors might be developed as potential novel therapeutics. Professor Newbold's team was the first to clone the var genes of P. falciparum, now known to be central to the parasite's pathogenicity. His work sparked a transformation in people's thinking about malaria and how immunity to the parasite develops. He went on to show that the parasite can rapidly switch its antigenic and adhesive phenotypes in vitro and identified host-cell surface molecules, including ICAM on endothelial cells, that act as receptors for malaria-infected red blood cells. Much of Professor Newbold's research on immunity to severe malaria has been performed in collaboration with researchers at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme. The team demonstrated that immunity to severe malaria is acquired rapidly after only one or two infections and that antibodies to var gene products such as PfEMP1 are important in generating effective immunity to malaria. Recently, in collaboration with researchers in the Gambia, his team has explored the transcriptional regulation of gene activity in isolates of P. falciparum from people with malaria. As part of the study, the team developed new statistical methods that are now freely available to other researchers to help to account for parasites at different stages of the life cycle within the host. They identified two transcriptional clusters that are likely to correlate with sexual and asexual stages of the parasite's life cycle. Professor Newbold's research has made a significant impact on the malaria research community and on our understanding of malaria genetics and gene function. His work in malaria-endemic areas such as Kenya has helped our understanding of how people develop immunity to malaria and what causes disease symptoms. This information will inform future developments that may lead to new treatments and/or vaccines that protect against the disease. His research continues to explore how antigenic variation affects immunity to malaria infection and severity of disease. The arrival of new sequencing technologies will allow researchers to explore in ever greater detail the molecular machinery involved in the parasite's complex life cycle. Professor Newbold's team is particularly interested in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression and has identified non-coding RNAs that may be important. In addition, the team is studying the population biology of Plasmodium species field isolates in order to understand in more detail how drug resistance spreads and to find ways to combat it. The wealth of Plasmodium sequence data that has been accumulating since the first annotated draft of the genome was published in 2002 has helped Professor Newbold and collaborators to identify and update a quarter of the gene models within the P. falciparum genome and will allow a much more accurate and detailed analysis of the genome to be published in the near future.References Smith JD et al.

His research team is now working to translate new approaches in genomics, statistics and computer science into tools that will help to reduce the massive burden of disease in low-income countries. Malaria remains the main focus of their work, as a classic example of natural selection in action. Understanding the evolutionary processes and biological mechanisms that confer human resistance to malaria and parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs could provide vital insights and new tools to assist global efforts to control malaria. This is scientifically and technically challenging at multiple levels. For example, one of the team's major projects is a trans-ethnic genome-wide association study of human resistance to severe malaria, in partnership with researchers working at 12 different locations in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Because of the great genetic diversity of human populations in Africa, this requires the development of new statistical methods and the optimisation of genotyping platforms. Another large partnership project is to sequence the genome of Plasmodium falciparum samples from around the world. The aim is to sequence thousands of genomes each year, which requires technological innovations to achieve large-scale genome sequencing of field samples at low cost. A key area of the work is to develop web-based tools that enable researchers in malaria-endemic countries to analyse and share data on the samples that they have collected, and to make large-scale genomic data accessible and useful to clinical researchers and epidemiologists in malaria-endemic countries. Professor Kwiatkowski's team is also working with partners around the world to develop principles and policies for data sharing that respect principles of ownership and ethics, as well as a commitment to research capacity building in malaria-endemic countries, leading to equitable and sustainable global research networks. Their ultimate goal is to develop cost-effective genome- based technologies that could provide early warning of the emergence and spread of new forms of drug resistance. In addition, by improving understanding of natural mechanisms of disease resistance, their findings could aid development of a malaria vaccine. References Teo YY et al.

Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski is developing global partnerships that enable researchers in malaria-endemic countries to use these new technologies and translate them into practical applications for malaria control. Background Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that invade human red blood cells and are transmitted from one person to another by bloodsucking Anopheles mosquitoes. There is an ongoing evolutionary arms race between the malaria parasites, the mosquito vector and the human host. Parasite populations are continually evolving ways to resist the drugs that are used to treat the disease; mosquito populations develop resistance to insecticides; and some people have genetic factors that confer natural resistance to malaria. The pace of innovation in this area of research has increased rapidly over the past decade. A crucial milestone was the publication of the first human genome sequence, shortly followed by the genome sequences of Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles gambiae. Important recent advances include new technologies for large-scale genome sequencing, and new statistical methods for genome-wide analysis of genotype-phenotype associations and recent evolutionary selection. Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski leads the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's Malaria Programme, which brings together population-based studies and experimental genetic approaches to investigate the clinical and biological consequences of genome variation in the parasite, vector and host. A major focus of his work is to build the global research partnerships that are needed to conduct large-scale genomic epidemiological studies. These include studies of the human genetic factors that determine protective immunity against malaria and studies of the parasite genetic factors and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the emergence and global spread of new forms of antimalarial drug resistance. Professor Kwiatkowski originally trained as a paediatrician before embarking on his research career in the 1980s, initially funded by a Wellcome Trust training fellowship for medical and dental graduates. After a period of research in the USA, he worked for several years with Professor Brian Greenwood at the MRC Laboratories in the Gambia. He joined the University of Oxford in 1989 and since 1998 has been an MRC Clinical Research Professor, a position he now complements with his role at the Sanger Institute. In 2007, he was appointed as Director of the MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health, which provides support and training in genetics, statistics, informatics and ethics for researchers in low-income countries. Since 2008, he has also been Director of Informatics for the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network, a global partnership of clinicians, researchers and public health agencies with major funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Advance In the Gambia, Professor Kwiatkowski established the critical role of cytokines (cell signalling proteins secreted by the immune system) in malaria fever and discovered key biomarkers of cerebral malaria. He developed mathematical models of host-parasite population dynamics and directed a large therapeutic intervention study in severe childhood malaria, which included one of the world's first clinical trials of anti-cytokine therapy. In 1994, his laboratory in Oxford reported the first evidence that variations in a person's cytokine genes affect their susceptibility to infectious disease and went on to discover various molecular mechanisms through which common genetic variants affect these genes. His group's work has included a number of methodological innovations, including a way to investigate how natural variants affect transcriptional regulation in vivo. Professor Kwiatkowski initiated a multi-centre case-control study of malaria in 1996. In 2005, this developed into the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN), a partnership of malaria researchers in 21 countries, co-funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative. MalariaGEN is one of the world's largest resources for the analysis of genetic susceptibility to infectious disease and in 2009 published the Timeline of Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski Begins laboratory research at Tufts- New England Medical Center, Boston, funded by Wellcome Trust Research Training FellowshipAppointed MRC Senior Fellow at University of OxfordAppointed MRC Clinical Research Professor at University of OxfordMalaria Genomic Epidemiology Network launched with funding from Grand Challenges in Global Health initiativeAppointed as Director of MRC Translational Centre for Genomics and Global HealthGraduates in medicine from Guy's Hospital, LondonBegins clinical research at MRC Laboratories in the Gambia funded by MRC Clinical Training FellowshipInitiates multi-centre case-control study of genetic resistance to severe malaria in the Gambia, Malawi and KenyaMoves into newly built Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at OxfordAppointed Head of Malaria Programme at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Appointed as Director of Informatics of Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network 1979 1985 1986 1989 1996 1998 2000 2005 2008 2007 2006Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski. Wellcome Library, LondonPortfolio Review: Malaria | 57 56 | Portfolio Review: Malaria The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme Background The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme is well known internationally for its work tackling malaria and other infectious diseases, particularly bacterial and viral childhood infections. With links to the Trust since the 1940s, the Programme was formally established in 1989, in partnership with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The Programme has two sites. In Nairobi, a unit is based at the capital's Kenyatta Hospital and has strong links with the Ministry of Health, facilitating the translation of research findings into medical policy. The unit in coastal Kilifi (an hour's drive from Kenya's second-largest city, Mombasa) is based in a busy district hospital, serving over half a million people and linking basic studies to clinical applications with local relevance. Discoveries Recent research at the Programme includes a new global malaria atlas and studies on the clinical features and neurological effects of malaria, antimalarial drug resistance, treatments for acute respiratory infections, the natural history of sickle-cell disease, a large genetic birth cohort study, the management of severe malnutrition and paediatric HIV infection, and the epidemiology of epilepsy. The Malaria Atlas Project provides the first comprehensive description of the epidemiology and burden of the disease worldwide, at regional, continental and global scales. Studies have delivered the first comprehensive characterisation of severe malaria in African children and provided evidence that the influence of HIV, severe malnutrition and bacteraemia are over-represented in severe malaria. Translation Through the recently established Clinical Trial Facility, Kilifi served as one of two sites involved in a phase II trial of a new malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S, which has shown significant protection in young children. This has led to a phase III trial in which the Programme is also participating. The Kenya Programme has contributed to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of insecticide-treated bednets to prevent diseases, such as malaria, spread by mosquitoes. Researchers carried out one of the four large-scale trials on which current international policy is based, but the Programme has also demonstrated that millions of African children remain unprotected by the nets. Research leaders Strong community links are at the heart of the Programme, with an emphasis on capacity building and training to build scientific leadership and create a critical mass of support from trained research and non-research staff. The Programme employs over 600 people, 95 per cent of whom are Kenyan. Of the 100 scientists in the Programme, 75 are East African. A \u00a39 million Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust is helping to train local researchers in areas such as translational research, social science and clinical trials. Research environment The Programme conducts basic and clinical research in parallel, with results feeding directly into local and international health policy, and aims to expand the country's capacity to conduct multidisciplinary research that is strong, sustainable and internationally competitive. Although malaria remains a major focus of research at the Programme, there are many complex interactions with other diseases and with predisposing factors at the individual, community or health system level. Research is therefore organised under four broad themes: - clinical sciences, including bedside research, developmental medicine and disability, and therapeutics - epidemiological and human genetics research on infectious diseases, including malaria, HIV and pneumonia, and non-infectious diseases such as epilepsy, sickle-cell disease and malnutrition - pathogen and vector biology, involving basic science research on immunity, pathogenesis and drug targets - social, behavioural and public health research, where social scientists, health economists and others study the social and behavioural aspects of healthcare at different levels, helping to shape local policy. Working with the community, researchers are also looking at local perceptions of research and the consent process, helping to raise awareness of medical ethics in resource-poor countries. Influence The Programme plays a key part in a number of regional initiatives, such as the Network for Surveillance of Pneumococcal Disease in the East African Region (netSPEAR) and the East African Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (EANMAT, looking in particular at antimalarial drug resistance). It also has increasing links with researchers and institutions around the region, with research projects based in neighbouring countries such as Somalia and Uganda. For example, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the Programme is studying a large cohort of people with sickle-cell disease to define the natural history of the disease and to improve treatment and management. Clinical and therapeutic research from the Programme directly informs the Kenyan Government's malaria guidelines for hospital care for children and newborns. The Programme helped the Kenyan Ministry of Health to establish its 2001 National Malaria Strategy and runs an in-depth demographic surveillance survey as part of INDEPTH, an international organisation evaluating populations and their health in low-income countries. Policy researchers have conducted extensive studies on paediatric admissions in health systems. They developed a 'shopkeeper training programme' for improving the treatment of childhood fevers in rural areas, which was adopted as a national programme and has had a major influence on programmes in other African countries.

As part of moves to strengthen the Wellcome Trust's evaluation activity, in 2008, the Assessment and Evaluation team developed an approach to review the impact of its funding at a subject, portfolio level. Finding the optimum way to review the impact of scientific research - and to use such information in strategic decision making - remains a significant challenge. In this portfolio review, we do not attempt to provide an assessment of the impact of awards at an individual grant and/or funding scheme level but instead we take a macro, holistic view of the development of a field over time and consider the Wellcome Trust's role within this. 2. The specific aims of the portfolio review were three-fold: 1. to identify the key landmarks and influences on the malaria research landscape over the past two decades (1990-2009) 2. to consider the key features of the Wellcome Trust's impact on this malaria research landscape 3. to consider the current and future direction of malaria and consider where there may be opportunities for Wellcome Trust strategy and funding. 3. To provide some boundaries and restrict the scope of the analysis, this review focuses on human malaria infection research, encompassing parasite and vector biology, host response and pathogenesis, resources and infrastructure, drug development, diagnostics, evaluation and resistance, epidemiology (surveillance and distribution), vaccinology, health services, ethics and policy research, prevention and control (including vector control), research design, technology and methodology, and the history of malaria. 4. On this basis, over the 20-year timeframe (1990-2009), support for malaria has accounted for \u00a3189m,144 representing just over 3 per cent of the Trust's total funding commitment over this time. During this time, an additional \u00a3120m (52 grants) was allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the Trust's MOPs; much of the work undertaken in these Centres and MOPs has played a part in facilitating malaria-focused research and providing training and research capacity development. In addition, the WTSI spend on malaria-focused research during this time period was \u00a38.8m. 144 Wellcome Trust funding commitment between the financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008.5. In addition, in doing this review of a portfolio of funding - adopting a more macro approach to a review, looking at trends across the field and bringing subject experts into the heart of a review - we hope to test whether this approach is valuable to the Wellcome Trust and strategy more generally. 6. Finding the optimum way to review the impact of scientific research - and to use such information in strategic decision making - remains a major challenge. When attempting to assess the impact of a particular funding stream or funder over a substantial amount of time, we made the decision not to review on a micro basis (by looking at individual grants) but instead to take a macro, holistic view of the development of the field over time and consider the part that the Wellcome Trust and its funding has played within the field. We know that the Wellcome Trust has committed a substantial amount of its funding for malaria and specifically malaria-focused research over a long period. Support for malaria remains a cornerstone of its research funding strategy. 7. The review involved three complementary streams: a landscape analysis narrative case studies an Expert Group Landscape analysis 8. The landscape analysis had three components: the Wellcome Trust funding analysis an international scientific, policy and funding landscape analysis a bibliometric analysis Wellcome Trust funding analysis 9. A search of the Wellcome Trust's AS400 Grants System was conducted to identify malaria-related funding provided by the Wellcome Trust from 1990 onwards. This involved a search for specific search terms, as identified by Wellcome Trust Science Funding Staff. The full list of grants was then manually filtered to identify grants with a 'malaria' focus. After accounting for grant extensions and WTSI-based grants,145 a total of 515 individual 145 Only a small minority of WTSI grants feature on the WT AS400 grant system. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute data are, therefore, provided directly by WTSI, unless otherwise stated.Annex A: Membership of the Wellcome Trust Expert Group on Malaria Annex B: MethodologyPortfolio Review: Malaria | 61 60 | Portfolio Review: Malaria grants with a malaria focus have been funded by the Wellcome Trust over this time. An additional 52 grants were allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the Trust's MOPs. In terms of the total financial value of funding committed by the Wellcome Trust, supplements and extensions to grants were included. International scientific, policy and funding landscape analysis 10. To provide context to the development of malaria research over the time period under investigation, a Timeline of key events was produced by Wellcome Trust staff. The Timeline contains key historical scientific advances and/or 'firsts' that have taken place or had a major impact on malaria-related research, focusing particularly on 1990 to the present day. Each event on the Timeline has been classified as a 'scientific advance and knowledge', a 'policy development' or a 'funding development' . 11. The Timeline was used as a prompt during the consultation with the Wellcome Trust Expert Group, and their feedback on the content was invited; the revised version of the Timeline is included in Annex E. Bibliometric analysis 12. To identify key trends in the type, nature and location of malaria research over this period, an analysis of publication outputs was conducted. This bibliometric analysis was conducted by Evidence, a Thomson Reuters business, and draws on the databases underlying the Web of Science, which include comprehensive coverage of more than 10 000 journals. All research papers included within the databases are allocated by Thomson Reuters to one or more of 253 different subject categories according to which journal the paper is published in; however, it is not possible to easily identify papers concerning malaria from these journal subject categories alone, so a subject filter was created146 based on the following keywords anopheles #4 \"black water fever\" 146 The filter was created by Wellcome Trust scientific staff in collaboration with Evidence Ltd. 13. As such, the final dataset is thought to be a good proximate dataset for the field of malaria research. It contained 34 197 papers published over the period 1989-2008.147 14. In addition to information on the volume and origins of malaria research publications, a citation analysis was conducted to provide insight into the quality of papers emerging over the period. To account for variation in citation practices across fields and the impact of publication date on the number of citations accumulated, Evidence rebase (or normalise) all raw citation data to the world average in the relevant subject field in the year of publication. In the context of this report, 'highly cited papers' refers to those papers with an average rebased impact of at least 4 (i.e. they have received at least four times as many citations as the average paper published in that year in the same subject area). 15. With scientific research becoming an increasingly collaborative and multi-location activity, research papers are often linked to multiple authors based at more than one research institution. This report uses 'integer counting', meaning that any single paper counts as 'one' output for each author, institution and country contributing to its publication. For example, a paper with two authors from Harvard University, one author from the University of Texas and one author from the University of Oxford is counted as one output for each of the four authors concerned, one output for each of the three named institutions, and one output each for the USA and the UK. The tables of top countries, institutions and authors, therefore, will feature an element of double counting. 16. Evidence are able to supply data on UK organisations with a high degree of accuracy because they ensure that organisational name variants are reconciled into one name to counter the limitations of the raw Thomson Reuters address data on the papers themselves. For non-UK data, the tables in this report rely on the raw data, so paper numbers should be considered as indicative rather than absolute, although address reconciliation was effected for 'significant' research organisations. This methodology will have most impact where major organisations have several institutions or research centres (e.g. the MRC will be split into its constituent parts, whereas papers associated with the separate institutes of the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, Spanish National Research Council or the Chinese 147 Because of the availability of citation data, the period of bibliometric analysis covers the period 1989-2008.Academy of Sciences are all indexed under the name of the parent organisation). Narrative case studies 17. A series of case studies were compiled to tell the story and highlight the key accomplishments of specific Wellcome Trust investments. These narratives were selected to reflect the range of funding types, from major infrastructure and fellowship support to collaborations. Wellcome Trust Expert Group on Malaria 18. To complement the landscape analyses and case study work, a key component of this portfolio review was the engagement of malaria experts to provide a review of the key influences on the field and an assessment of the Wellcome Trust's role within this. Instead of consulting experts on an individual basis, we tested whether we could usefully employ a cohort of independent subject experts in a group setting. 19. Witness Seminars: in 1990, the Wellcome Trust created a History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, as part of the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the history of medicine, to bring together clinicians, scientists, historians and others interested in contemporary medical history.148 Among several other initiatives, the format of Witness Seminars was adopted to promote interaction between these different groups. The Witness Seminar is a specialised form of oral history, where several people (approximately 40) associated with a particular set of circumstances or events are invited to come together to discuss, debate and agree or disagree about their memories. The Witness Seminar initiative was led by Professor Tilli Tansey, then at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, UCL, and after October 2010 at the School of History, Queen Mary, University of London. Further information about Witness Seminars can be found in volumes of Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine.149 20. Drawing on the Witness Seminar approach to history and influence mapping, which was originally developed by the Institute of Contemporary British History in 1986, a small number of experts (n = 7, plus 148 See 'Introduction' to recent volumes of Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine published by the Wellcome Trust, the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London and Queen Mary, University of London. 149 www.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/biomed/index.htmla Chair) were invited to debate and discuss the status of malaria research 1990-2009 over the course of an afternoon. Existing and increasing pressures on experts generated by the peer review system embedded into science funding have made it traditionally (and increasingly) difficult to involve experts in post-award review, where arguably they could play a major part in helping to consider future funding allocation at a more strategic level. Experts were selected on the basis of their expertise in the field and, to ensure the maximum relevance to the review's aims, at least half of the experts had a fairly good knowledge of the Trust over the period in question. 21. The Expert Group received a summary of the landscaping and bibliometric analysis in advance of their meeting hosted at the Wellcome Trust in April 2010. Under the Chairmanship of Professor Dan Colley, the discussion was framed around the broad areas of questioning seen in Table A. The meeting was recorded and the tapes transcribed. We found, alongside significant landscape analysis, that allowing our experts to be both retrospective and speculative enabled us to draw out learning from the past with future implications and to consider how this might link to current and potential future funding strategies.

Portfolio Review: Malaria | 63 62 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 22. Between the financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008, the Wellcome Trust has awarded 515 grants,150 mainly in responsive mode, to malaria-focused projects across all its funding divisions. These grants accounted for \u00a3189m, representing just over 3 per cent of the Trust's funding commitment over this time (excluding WTSI, \u00a38.8m; see Table 3 and Table 3a). An additional \u00a3120m (52 grants) was allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the Trust's MOPs. Approximately two-fifths (42 per cent by number, 42 per cent by value, 216 grants, or \u00a380m) of malaria grant funding has been career-based, supporting individual researchers doing malaria-based projects via personal support schemes (Table 1). These personal support schemes include studentships (\u00a39m), Early Career Fellowships (\u00a38m), Intermediate Fellowships (\u00a325m), and Senior and Principal research fellowships (\u00a338m). 150 Wellcome Trust grant data in this review are not comparable with G-FINDER grant data. G-FINDER grant data include disbursements made only for active primary grants. Wellcome Trust funding data include all active and completed grants between the financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008.23. The larger proportion of funds (58 per cent by number, 58 per cent by value, 299 grants, or \u00a3109m) has been allocated to research and project support (equipment, university awards, strategic awards, and project and programme grants; Table 1). An additional \u00a3120m (52 grants) was allocated for core support and infrastructure at Wellcome Trust Centres and the MOPs.Annex C: Wellcome Trust funding for malaria Figure 1 Wellcome Trust grants supporting malaria research, including infrastructure grants to Wellcome Trust Centres and MOPs, 1990-2008 a Excludes funding to the WTSI because grant type data are not available in comparable format. b Percentages are rounded and might not equal 100 per cent. **Other; see Table 1a.

Conducted the South-east Asian quinine artesunate malaria trial (SEAQUAMAT), demonstrating that the artemisinin drug artesunate reduced mortality by 35 per cent compared with quinine. 152 This research formed the basis of the WHO's management guidelines in 2006.153 Conducted the largest ever study in severe malaria (AQUAMAT), demonstrating that artesunate reduces the mortality of severe malaria in African children by 22 per cent compared with quinine and is highly cost effective. 154 2010: Professor Nick White, Chairman of the Wellcome Trust South-east Asian Tropical Medicine Research Programmes, received the Gairdner Award. Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU), part of Tropical Medicine Research ProgrammeDirector: Fran\u00e7ois Nosten1986 SMRU has received funding from the pharmaceutical industry, WHO, the European Union and VIHPAL (French Government). In 2000, SMRU (via Oxford University) was awarded a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to extend the control of malaria to the entire Tak Province in collaboration with the Thai Ministry of Health.Work conducted aims to be of direct benefit to the local community. SMRU also aims to provide information useful to other worldwide populations living with malaria. 1991: Nick White was awarded a Principal Research Fellowship. Provided the first detailed description of the effects of malaria during pregnancy in South-east Asia. 155, 156 Developed a system of antenatal care that has eliminated maternal malaria-related mortality. 157 Established the safety of the artemisinin derivatives in pregnancy. 158 Defined the development of mefloquine drug resistance in this area and produced extensive information (in more than 5000 patients) of its adverse effects and predictors of treatment response. 159 Assessed the benefit of high-dose halofantrine and discovered its cardiotoxicity. 160 Treated more than 10 000 patients with artemisinin derivatives (the largest single-centre study in the world). Conducted the first studies to look at a possible cumulative toxicity of this family of drugs in humans. Documented for the first time the impact of artesunate on the transmission of malaria and the spread of resistance and pioneered the use of ACT. 161,162 Evaluated the USA-manufactured malaria vaccine SPf66 in its most detailed and carefully conducted trial. Documented the effects of P. vivax in pregnancy. 163 2008: Francois Nosten won the Christophe and Rodolphe Merieux Foundation Prize (\u20ac400 000) from the Institut de France to honour his ground-breaking malaria research.Table 7 Overview of malaria-focused R&D at the Wellcome Trust MOPsPortfolio Review: Malaria | 75 74 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 161 Nosten F et al.

The programme has developed a core group of productive researchers who hold \u00a325m of competitively awarded grants and contribute high-quality papers to the scientific literature. In 2008, a \u00a39m Wellcome Trust Strategic Award was awarded to help train local researchers. Local collaborators: Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; and Kenyatta National Hospital. National universities and tertiary institutions: Muliro University and University of Nairobi. International collaborators: MRC; Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC); International Development Research Centre; Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); KEMRI-Wellcome Trust, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Walter Reed Army Institute of Medical Research; World Association of Industrial and Technologist Research Organizations (WAITRO); WHO; and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. Regional collaborators: Blair Research Centre, Zimbabwe; Ethiopia Health and Nutrition Research Institute, Ethiopia; Makerere University Medical School; Medical Research Council of South Africa; National Institute of Medical Research, Tanzania; Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research, Ghana; Suez Canal University, Egypt; and University of Zambia Medical School, Zambia. 164Conducts basic and clinical research in parallel, with results feeding directly into local and international health policy, and aims to expand the country's capacity to conduct multidisciplinary research that is strong, sustainable and internationally competitive. 1988: A \u00a30.5m award to Professor David Warrell at the Wellcome-KEMRI/Oxford Malaria Unit, Kilifi, for a study of severe P. falciparum malaria in African children. Developed evidence-based framework for international efforts to define the burden and spatial extents of malaria at regional, continental and global scales. Demonstrated the key role of immune responses to variant antigens expressed on the malaria-infected red cell surface. Identified common variant antigens associated with severe malaria and with immunity to disease. Conducted innovative research on the community perceptions of research and the consent process, stimulating international interest in medical ethics in resource-poor countries. 165 Translational research and policy formation Carried out one of the four key large-scale trials of impregnated bednets on which current international policy is now based. Carried out a major study on the intermittent preventative treatment of malaria in pregnancy, on which national and international policy is now based. Developed a training programme for improving the treatment of childhood fevers in rural areas, which has subsequently been adopted as a national programme and has had a major influence on programmes in other African countries. Provided technical support to the Ministry of Health to establish a National Malaria Strategy, launched by the Government of Kenya in 2001. Developed Inpatient Care Guidelines for Kenya in collaboration with the Division of Child Health, Ministry of Health, using a substantial body of research evidence generated by the Programme over the past 5-10 years as the standard of care for children in Kenya and used in international guidelines (Child Advocacy Manual 2002 and WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children, 2004). Developed and hosted the Network for Surveillance of Pneumococcal Disease in the East African Region (netSPEAR) and the East African Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (EANMAT), working together with ministries of health, research institutions and international organisations in seven East African countries to provide crucial information for vaccination and drug policy in the region. Capacity building Expanded the PhD training programme. In 2002, the unit was recognised as an Open University sponsoring establishment, and the majority of students are now registered through this mechanism. 2005: Researched the scale of malaria. Their estimate of 515 million clinical episodes of P. falciparum suggests that tackling malaria will require even greater attention than governments and health agencies have anticipated. 166 2008: Deaths have fallen by 75 per cent over the past five years. Over longer time frames, 18 years of hospital surveillance data reveal a steady decline in malaria - testament to the success of new drug programmes, the use of insecticide-treated bednets and other measures. 2008: Clinical trials showed that pregnancy alters the efficacy of antimalarials and that the doses of medicines given to pregnant women were too low - findings that led to a revision of WHO guidelines. 2008/2009 research brought the malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS closer to phase III clinical trials. Title Established Funding Aim Key accomplishments and discoveries (to end 2009) The Vietnam Research Programme and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU)Chairman: Professor Nick WhiteDirector: Professor Jeremy Farrar 1991 The Wellcome Trust has supported the Programme for almost 20 years and recently extended its core support through to 2015.Monitoring and understanding drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax. Played a major part in establishing the role of artemisinin derivatives for the treatment of falciparum malaria. Helped to establish the burden of vivax malaria in South-east Asia, showing that vivax - which was previously considered relatively harmless - is common and can cause severe disease. 167 Has developed strong links with HTD and other hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and other regions of Vietnam. In February 2006, an OUCRU office in Hanoi was opened. Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research ProgrammeDirector: Professor Robert Heyderman1995 2008: The Programme was awarded \u00a38.6m of core funding by the Trust. Core funding from the Wellcome Trust maintains the centre, and Trust-funded research fellowships and project grants have been awarded to many participating biomedical scientists and clinicians. 168Focuses on five major multidisciplinary research themes, namely malaria and brain diseases, therapeutics in the tropics, severe bacterial infection, mucosal and vaccine immunity, and health in the population. 169 Advanced malaria treatment and monitoring, notably through the development of the Blantyre Coma Score, a system that helps to monitor children in malaria-induced coma. 2005/2006: Conducted studies that led to the change in policy and practice for LapDap usage, and rectal artesunate for comatose children with malaria. Conducted the biggest autopsy study ever of children with fatal malaria showing that some, who had died of what seemed to be severe malaria, had received a different diagnosis. This research helped the team to understand the importance of changes in the retina associated with malarial infection, which may lead to improved diagnosis of the disease. Worked with College of Medicine at the University of Malawi to improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, anaemia and tuberculosis. This research has been used to advise healthcare strategy in Malawi and has also contributed to the worldwide fight against these diseases. The centre has also trained local doctors and graduates.Portfolio Review: Malaria | 77 76 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 170 Gardner MJ et al.

The International Anopheles Genome Project1999 Funded principally by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and by the French Government, with the World Health Organization/Tropical Disease Research (WHO/TDR, Geneva, Switzerland) programme providing a coordinating role and assisting in database development. The Wellcome Trust supported this project through the annotation of the genome by Ensembl - the latter being a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the WTSI.To determine the sequence of the genome of Anopheles gambiae. Completion of the genome sequence of A. gambiae, published in Science in 2002. 171 In 2007, Sharakhova et al. improved the physical map and assembly of the A. gambiae genome.172Table 8 Overview of malaria-focused collaborations, partnerships and resources where the Wellcome Trust has played a major part Title Established Funding/support Aim Key malaria-focused accomplishments Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM)1998 The Wellcome Trust helped establish the MIM, an alliance of organisations and individuals concerned with malaria. The Wellcome Trust provided the first Secretariat, for a period of 18 months (1997-1999). 173 An audit of international research activity in malaria was carried out by the Wellcome Trust in 1996 and again in 1999. The Wellcome Trust's International Programmes produced a report, 'Strengthening Health Research in the Developing world: Malaria Research Capacity in Africa', to provide evidence to guide the development of the MIM. 174MIM is an alliance of individuals, funding partners, and four autonomous constituents: the MIM/TDR, MIMCom, MR4 and the MIM Secretariat. 175 Establishment of the MIM Secretariat. The MIM Secretariat convened the first, second, third, fourth and fifth MIM Pan-African Malaria Conferences in Dakar, Senegal (1997), Durban, South Africa (1999), Arusha, Tanzania (2002), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon (2005) and Nairobi, Kenya (2009). The MIM Secretariat is the coordinating arm of the MIM, initially based in London at the Wellcome Trust (1997-1999), then based at Fogarty International Center at NIH, USA (1999-2001), the Karolinska Institutet/ Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden (2003-2005), and African Malaria Network Trust (AMANET), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2006-2010). On 15 October 2010, the Biotechnology Centre of the University of Yaounde I/Amsterdam Medical Centre officially became the new host of the MIM Secretariat. Creation of Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Center (MR4). MR4 is a biological resource centre providing research reagents for free to malaria scientists. The MR4 is located at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Manassas, Virginia, USA. It has more than 300 reagents, including antibodies, antigens, plasmids, expressed sequence tag (EST) clones, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and genomic/cDNA libraries, and several different species and strains of Plasmodium and Anopheles. MR4 has supplied reagents for malaria research to 19 African countries. Creation of MIM Communication Network (MIMCom). MIMCom is based at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in the USA and comprises telecommunications, information access, and new tools for research, training and evaluation. MIMCom has built fast and reliable internet connections at 27 internet satellite sites in 14 African countries. Creation of MIM/TDR - embedded in the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. Since its inception, more than 220 graduate-level scientists have been trained in 33 institutions in Africa. 173 www.mimalaria.org/eng/historyandevolution.asp 174 www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@sitestudioobjects/documents/web_document/wtd003224.pdf 175 www.mimalaria.org/eng/aboutmim.aspPortfolio Review: Malaria | 79 78 | Portfolio Review: Malaria 176 www.mmv.org/ 177 Poll E, Banerji J (eds). 2009.

In 2009, MMV received its fifth and largest grant from the Gates Foundation (US$115 million), in addition to new funding from DFID (US$30 million) - both to support MMV over five years. 177 In 2011, the Trust provided a further award of \u00a35m.MMV's mission is to reduce the burden of malaria in disease-endemic countries by discovering, developing and facilitating the delivery of new, effective and affordable antimalarial drugs. A study by the Ministry of Health and MMV showed that heavily subsidising ACTs by 90 per cent or more results in greater uptake of these life-saving medicines in the private sector. The availability of ACTs at minimal cost led to a rapid increase of ACT stocks and use by children under the age of five, as well as a fall in market share of ineffective antimalarials such as chloroquine. 178 2009: Novartis and MMV launched the first high-quality ACT formulated especially for children - Coartem\u00ae Dispersible. By June 2011, 72 million treatments of this life-saving medicine had been delivered to 35 countries. 2010: Guilin Pharmaceutical Artesunate injection received WHO prequalification. The trial, led by Professor Nick White, demonstrated that artesunate reduced the mortality rate by 22.5 per cent. In response to this important data, the WHO updated their guidelines to recommend artesunate injection as the first-line treatment for severe malaria in African children. 2010: MMV and Shin Poong Pharmaceutical Co Ltd developed a new ACT. Pyramax is a fixed-dose combination of pyronaridine and artesunate that has completed a program of clinical trials demonstrating more than 95 per cent efficacy at day 28. The Pyramax dossier was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for regulatory approval at the end of March 2010. 2011: MMV and partners completed a series of tests to determine which marketed and in-development antimalarials have gametocidal or transmission-blocking capability. The data will be crucial in informing the development of the next-generation antimalarials to eradicate malaria. 2011: Funding agreed with Anacor Pharmaceuticals and MMV to extend the existing development agreement to fund the clinical development of AN3661, a boron-based drug candidate for the treatment of malaria. 2011: Two new medicines (Sigma-tau's DHA-piperaquine and artesunate pyronaridine) are currently awaiting regulatory approval, and MMV has 14 innovative novel molecules in the pipeline with the potential to tackle drug resistance. Fifty projects are specifically targeting malaria eradication. 179 MalariaGEN 1802005 MalariaGEN was formally established in 2005 as part of the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, with joint funding from the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. 181 In 2005, Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski received a Wellcome Trust award (\u00a34.3m) from the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative to integrate and build on the work of malaria research groups around the world through the formation of MalariaGEN.To develop cost-effective genome-based technologies that could provide early warning of the emergence and spread of new forms of drug resistance. 2009: Published the first genome-wide association study conducted in Africa. 182 Discovered a method to detect the malaria-protective effect of the sickle variant and also pinpointed the precise spot in the genome where this malaria-protective factor is located. 2009: Researchers carried out a GWA study in search of genetic variants associated with resistance to fatal forms of malaria. 183Title Established Funding/support Aim Key malaria-focused accomplishments The Malaria Atlas Project 1842005 Led by Robert Snow and Simon Hay. Robert Snow was supported by the Wellcome Trust through a Senior Research Fellowship (\u00a33.4m), and Simon Hay was also supported through a Senior Research Fellowship (\u00a31.14m). This work was also supported by Wellcome Trust Collaborative grants (\u00a3370 000).To assemble medical intelligence and survey data to provide evidence-based maps on the distribution of malaria risk, human population, disease burdens, mosquito vectors, inherited blood disorders, and malaria financing and control worldwide. Produced the first global malaria risk map to be developed in more than 40 years. 185 Collected information from 3670 communities in 79 countries and represents the single largest repository of contemporary information of malaria risk. 186 Assembled a unique spatial database of linked information based on medical intelligence and satellite-derived climate data to constrain the limits of malaria transmission and the largest ever archive of community-based estimates of parasite prevalence. 187 Defined the spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission, showing the disease affected 2.37 billion people in 2007.188 Showed how funding disparities had achieved varied intervention coverage in Africa by 2007: 90 million African children remained unprotected by an insecticide-treated mosquito net in 2007. 189 Outlined the implications of population-at-risk for global financing of control and elimination: funding from international and bilateral agencies toward malaria control remains less than $1 per year per person at risk (a shortfall of between 50 per cent and 450 per cent of projected need, depending on the country). 190 Showed that strategies to combat disease are likely to have a much greater effect on the distribution of malaria than climate change. 191 Showed the intensity of transmission within these margins of risk, revealing three-quarters of the global population live in areas of low risk and suggesting elimination is feasible in many areas outside of Africa. 192 Developed a map of malaria risk for Kenya in 2009.193 The Malaria Atlas Project has shown that there could have been between 349 and 552 million clinical cases of P. falciparum malaria worldwide in 2007. 194 Developed an Atlas of Malaria-Eliminating Countries in 2011, with the Global Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco. Developed a global map of P. falciparum malaria for the year 2010. 195 Developed a global map of vivax malaria endemicity in 2012.196 Malaria Drug research at The Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD)2007 The Wellcome Trust, the Singapore Economic Development Board and MMV pledged more than \u00a310m in funding, and NITD manage the programme and conduct research jointly with several institutions, including the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and the Swiss Tropical Institute.To achieve the ambitious goal of producing a robust pipeline of drug candidates to treat dengue, tuberculosis and malaria. Aim by 2012 to have at least two drug candidates in patient trials. 197 Research at NITD focuses on the identification of compounds that can be used to produce a single-dose cure for P. falciparum and a cure for P. vivax. 198 A high-throughput cell-based screen of 1.7 million compounds identified 6000 able to inhibit the growth of P. falciparum in red blood cells. 199 2006: A Wellcome Trust grant of \u00a36.4m awarded to Professor Alex Matter for a programme of drug discovery research in malaria. 200 181 www.malariagen.net/about/funding 182 Malaria Genomics Epidemiology Network.

Wellcome Trust grant data are 'committed' between Wellcome Trust financial years 1989/1990 and 2007/2008.Title Established Funding/support Aim Key malaria-focused accomplishments The Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) 2012010 Over the next five years, H3 Africa will receive at least \u00a38m from the Wellcome Trust and \u00a33.4m a year from the NIH. The NIH also provided US$750 000 to fund the initial project start-up.To facilitate a contemporary research approach to the study of genomics and environmental determinants of common, non- communicable disorders such as heart disease and cancer, as well as infectious diseases such as malaria. The overall aim is to improve the health of African populations. 202 Researchers funded under H3 Africa will establish or enhance local research facilities in their home country. This will enable them to use genome-wide scanning and sequencing technologies to identify genetic changes that contribute to the diseases and disorders selected for study. PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI)1999 Established after a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The trials were funded by PATH MVI, but the facilities at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme were used for the phase II RTS,S trials and are still being used for the ongoing phase III trials.To accelerate the development of malaria vaccines and ensure their availability and accessibility in the developing world. MVI have a multi-pronged approach to developing a next-generation vaccine by 2025. 2011: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S was in large multi-centre phase III trials. This is the leading malaria vaccine, which has shown promising efficacy. The first results from the ongoing phase III trial showed that RTS,S reduces the risk of malaria by half in African children aged 5 to 17 months. 203 2008/2009: Two phase II studies published online in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that the RTS,S vaccine candidate provides both infants and young children with significant protection against infection and clinical disease caused by P. falciparum. This research, conducted at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kenya and Tanzania, brought RTS,S closer to phase III clinical trials. In 2009, MVI and GSK launched a large-scale phase III efficacy trial of RTS,S in 11 sites in seven African countries. The target enrolment of more than 15 000 children and infants was reached at the end of January 2011, making this the largest malaria vaccine trial to date. The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme is participating in these ongoing phase III trials. If the required public health information, including safety and efficacy data from the phase III programme, is deemed satisfactory, the WHO has indicated that a policy recommendation for the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is possible as early as 2015.Title Established Funding/support Aim Key malaria-focused accomplishments The Malaria Capacity Development Consortium (MCDC)2008 Led by Professor Brian Greenwood at LSHTM, the MCDC is funded by a \u00a37.3m Wellcome Trust Strategic Award. The consortium has also received an award of US$5m from BMGF, which will allow it to sustain investment in the investigators who were previously trained through the Gates Malaria Partnership (GMP). 204Designed to help able and motivated African scientists undertake high-quality research that will enhance the research capacity of their home institutions.In 2009: the MCDC recruited 18 PhD scholars twenty-one students benefitted from a Research Methodology Course hosted by the College of Medicine (COM), University of Malawi, Blantyre a Re-entry Grant was awarded to an MCDC investigator previously supported by the GMP three Investigator Programme Initiative Awards were awarded to MCDC investigators previously supported by the GMP the MCDC inaugural meeting took place at the KEMRI- Wellcome Trust Programme in Kilifi two Senior Postdoctoral Fellowships were awarded. In 2010: two new students joined the MCDC PhD Programme, making a total of 20 PhD students a Re-entry Grant was awarded to an Investigator previously supported by the GMP an MCDC researcher was awarded a Senior Research Fellowship R&D grant four Investigator Programme Initiative Awards were awarded to MCDC Investigators previously supported by the GMP a two-day workshop to support the supervisors and advisors of the MCDC PhD students was held in Kumasi a web-based supervisor forum used to facilitate communication within the MCDC Community website was launched. In 2011: five Investigator Programme Initiative Awards were awarded to MCDC Investigators previously supported by the GMP the MCDC postdoctoral mentoring programme was launched. MalariaGEN (see Table 7) and resourcesPathogen Sequencing Unit (renamed the Program)1996 The Wellcome Trust committed \u00a314.5m in 1996-97 to fund the work of Dr Bart Barrell and his colleagues.To collaborate internationally with other organisations in sequencing up to 50 pathogenic bacteria and five parasites. In 1996, sequencing of chromosome 1 of P. falciparum was identified as a pilot project. Bart Barrell and his colleagues at the Sanger Centre demonstrated that the assembly of the malaria sequence was possible from small clones of chromosome 1 - the proof of principle needed for large-scale sequencing to begin. In 1996, the malaria sequencing consortium launched the whole-genome sequencing effort of P. falciparum. In 2002, the complete genome sequence of P. falciparum was published in Nature. 205 Ensembl genome browser2000 European Bioinformatics Institute and WTSI high-quality, integrated annotation on chordate and selected eukaryotic genomes within a consistent and accessible infrastructure. 206 202 h3africa.org/ 203 The RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership.
