The permeation of some technologies in healthcare, like clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and artificial intelligence (AI), have also raised issues related to trust. For example, in what contexts should AI be trusted, what makes a trustworthy system, and what factors contribute to user trust in AI? Research question and method What factors contribute to stakeholder trust in AI-based CDSS? This project involves a scoping review and interviews with stakeholders (e.g. clinicians).

Compared with immunocompetent patients, solid organ transplant patients (SOTRs) are up to 51 times more likely to die from their cSCC. Despite an enhanced management pathway of prevention, close surveillance, early diagnosis, timely treatment and optimisation of the immunosuppressive regime, the SOTR population remains a challenging patient cohort from a cSCC standpoint. Therefore, the current project aims to study the genomic changes in clinical samples of cSCC through whole genome sequencing (WGS). The genomic and metastatic cSCCs from SOTRs versus immunocompetent patients will be compared to identify actionable therapeutic targets. The successful completion of this study will identify novel therapeutic targets for improved management of cSCCs.

Given that telomerase is not expressed in most normal cells, telomerase inhibition is an enticing target for anti-cancer therapy. However, while the function of telomerase is well characterised, less is known about the processes which regulate its function, including its recruitment to telomeres. We have previously demonstrated that the DNA damage response is important in regulating telomerase recruitment, while replication stress promotes this process. Given this, we hypothesise that there is controlled interplay between DNA replication, the DNA damage response and telomere maintenance. This project will elucidate the links between these processes using advanced microscopy techniques, genome editing and biochemical analyses.

Development of new technologies enables administration of high dose radiation within precise spatial targeting to kill tumour cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. While it is clear high dose radiation therapy kills cells, the mechanism of cell death, and the genetic pathways that promote radiation therapy sensitivity and resistance are unknown. Our research is focused on creating a roadmap that will determine with certainty how tumour cells die following ART. To do this, we are determining the role of DNA damage response and repair pathways, cell cycle regulation, inflammatory signalling, and environmental factors in radiation therapy induced cell death. Opportunities are available in this project will be tailored to applicants' interests and strengths on an individual basis.

A major driver of genome instability in oncogenesis is DNA \"replication stress\". Replication stress is broadly defined as any phenomena that negatively impacts copying of the genetic material and can arise through exogenous (e.g. low nutrient environment, genotoxic agents) or endogenous (e.g. oncogene expression) sources. Cells cope with replication stress through the \"replication stress response\" which arrests cell growth and mediates repair of the underlying lesions. Because tumour cells typically have high levels of endogenous replication stress, targeting the replication stress response is an opportunistic target in cancer therapy. Our research focuses on multiple aspects of the replication stress response. 1) Understanding how physical forces inside the nucleus alter nuclear architecture to mediate replication stress repair and 2) Understanding how chromatin is altered in the nuclear environment to enable replication stress repair. Opportunities are available in both projects will be tailored to applicants' interests and strengths on an individual basis.

To develop a herpes vaccine, the initial immune response in human genital mucosa needs to be defined. We showed that HSV is \"relayed\" from infected Langerhans cells in the epidermis to surrounding clusters of dendritic cells (DCs) and, other still undefined immune cells, in the dermis to initiate immunity. We can now profile mucosal immune cells by cyclic immunofluorescence microscopy (Westmead), and imaging mass cytometry (CPC), including in rare biopsies of herpes lesions. In this project you will comprehensively profile which subsets of DCs, T cells, NK cells and macrophages are present in these immune cell clusters in HSV infected human genital mucosal explants.

Project synopsis We are investigating the ability of electrical stimulation, applied to the cornea, to preserve visual function. Timed delivery of TES to a mouse model of advanced retinal degeneration preserves behavioural response to light. RNA sequencing experiments revealed upregulation and downregulation of key candidate genes involved in TES-mediated phenotypes. This project will validate these new targets using molecular biology techniques. Further characterisation of the cellular phenotype of TES treated mouse eyes, via the histological preparations, immunohistochemistry and imaging will confirm expression of markers of interest. Thus, revealing important mechanisms of TES and validating this approach to treat vision loss.

Regulatory T cell therapy has been shown as a novel promising treatment to minimise immunosuppressive burden in transplantation. Preliminary data from our lab has shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) isolated from human blood helps maintain tolerance and prevents islet graft rejection in a humanized mouse model. This project aims to identify a population of Tregs by a combination of unique key surface markers and to demonstrate their antigen specificity and suppressive function.

O'Connell Auxiliary Supervisor 2 Project ID 2023S1-28 Project title Towards a drug-free transplantation - how to improve regulatory T cell survival in transplantation Project synopsis In transplantation, a key goal is to achieve transplant-tolerance without immunosuppressive- drugs as they cause unnecessary side-effects. An emerging therapy involves using the body's immune cells to create a state where the recipient remains capable of responding to pathogens and the donor allograft is accepted. Previously we showed that regulatory T cells isolated from transplant-tolerant mice demonstrated tolerance, however the key cytokine that supports their survival is not well known. The project aims to investigate the role of IL-2, IL7 and IL33 pathways in Treg survival and assess their suppressive function. Students will learn animal handling, cell culture, molecular biology techniques such as flow-cytometry/ RT-PCR/ELISA, and we offer a unique opportunity to assist with a cutting-edge technique - single cell RNA sequencing.

Molecular dependencies associated with telomere maintenance present promising targets for new cancer therapeutics. To provide a platform for the development of cancer treatments that target telomere biology, our team has completed a study of telomere maintenance states and proteogenomics in approximately 1000 cell lines derived from more than 30 cancer types. Through this study, we have identified cancer cell lines with telomere biology phenotypes that deviate from those previously described. This Honours project will investigate these novel telomere biology states and their associated molecular dependencies using a range of molecular and cell biology techniques, immunofluorescence microscopy, gene expression modulation and telomere biology assays.

Aside from their role in cardiovascular disease, they are associated with poor clinical outcomes in many prevalent burdensome conditions such as wound healing, infection and dementia. Our group has found that monocytes from those with dyslipidaemia have a heightened inflammatory profile suggesting that important lipid-associated immunopathological changes are occurring. Our in vitro studies suggest that specific lipids metabolically reprogram monocytes; these may be driving the immunopathological changes. The honours student will join us in delineating the clinical association between lipids and monocyte metabolic profile and assessing the possible causal relationship of these associations by cell culture studies.

However, the success of this treatment has been limited by acute allograft rejection. My lab has recently identified several key driver genes including Caspase 1 that are associated with acute rejection in kidney transplant patients. This project aims to explore the role of Caspase 1 signaling in the development of acute rejection by using murine transplant models, to evaluate new agents for the prevention and treatment of rejection and develop new tools to identify patients at risk of acute rejection. Students will learn how to handle animals and provide post-operative care, tissue analysis (histology, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining), and perform cell and molecular biology techniques such as flow cytometry, real time RT-PCR and ELISA.

Project synopsis For patients with type 1 diabetes, islet transplantation enables independence from insulin therapy. Development of new drugs to prolong islet graft survival are needed in clinical practice. In recent clinical trials, we found a combination of Belatacept and Sirolimus was associated with increased regulatory T cells and central T cell memory response when compared to the traditional immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate. The aim of this project is to further investigate how this new form of treatment with Belatacept and Sirolimus affects the cytokine profile of na\u00efve, effector and memory T cells.

Project synopsis Brain cancer is the most common solid tumour in children. The cells are highly invasive, preventing successful eradication. Tissue stiffness promotes cancer invasion in other cancers, but how this affects brain cancer invasion is unknown. Stiff tissues stimulate the Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) transcriptional regulator. We have built a fluorescent timer carrying the YAP binding site coupled to a fluorescent protein that is green upon initial transcription and transitions to red over time. We will characterise the timer and analyse the activation of force-dependent signalling in brain cancer cells. We will use patient-derived brain cancer cells, organoids and a range of biochemical, molecular biology and microscopy-based analyses.

Telomeres shorten with each round of cell division until they become so short that they no longer functionally protect the chromosome. Telomere shortening triggers cellular senescence and limits the number of times normal human cells can divide. Cancer cells are immortal, and must activate a telomere maintenance mechanism to extend and repair their telomeres. This project will explore the mechanisms that become activated to extend telomeres in normal and cancer cells, and how these pathways contribute to cell proliferation. The project will also focus on therapeutic strategies to treat cancers based on the activated telomere maintenance mechanism. The research will employ cell culture and molecular biology techniques, including genetic manipulation by CRISPR and siRNA; DNA, RNA and protein analysis; advanced microscopy; and proteomics.

Current therapeutic options for OA are limited to pain medications, physiotherapy and joint replacement surgery. Pain in OA correlates poorly with radiographic joint damage making it difficult to manage pain symptoms. Our team has identified a novel mechanistic pathway involved in the pathogenesis of OA - the matrix protein thrombospondin-1. We also found that mice lacking this protein are less susceptible to bone damage that is characteristic of OA. We now hypothesise that TSP1 signalling regulates the development of OA, and TSP1-targeted therapy will mitigate features of OA. This study will investigate the risks factors for developing early knee osteoarthritis and pain by targeting TSP1. We will use a mouse model of OA and these mice will undergo specialised MRI and CT imaging to detect bone and cartilage changes that are characteristic of OA. The project will involve analysis of these radiological images using specialised software, as well as analysis of bone and joint tissue isolated from these mice (involving histological staining and standard molecular biology techniques).

DC therapy has been leveraged for autoimmune diseases and transplantation, and represents an appealing potential treatment for kidney disease, which has no current treatment other than standard-of-care. We have developed pharmacologically manipulated DC (tolerogenic DC, tolDC) that deliver both anti-inflammatory and anti-cell death responses to kidney cells. Preliminary data suggests these cells infused into mice are capable of protecting against acute kidney injury. This Honours project involves understanding the molecular characteristics of tolDC, and using them in several mouse models of kidney injury to reduce initial damage, as well as prevent progression of disease.

My lab is interested in understanding the mechanisms that prevent recovery from acute injury and/or promote progression to chronic disease. We have recently demonstrated that a mutation in the zinc finger protein A20 protects against acute kidney injury by upregulating anti-apoptotic genes. This protection occurred despite an increase in inflammatory cell infiltrate and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression within the kidney. Inflammation is the hallmark of chronic kidney disease, and preliminary experiments show that mutated A20 paradoxically promotes chronic injury. This project will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from acute to chronic kidney disease.

Patients typically are infected for life and the infection is currently incurable. The virus persists in the liver in a therapy-resistant form (closed circular DNA, cccDNA). To cure infection, the cccDNA must be cleared. We have developed novel assays and have discovered new viral mechanisms that maintain cccDNA. The goal of this project is to disrupt these pathways, thereby curing the infection. Our project brings together broad expertise and collaborates with world-leaders in virus infection models, cell biology, gene therapy, and clinical practice. Our complementary approaches are centred in the fundamental biology that underpins the development of new treatments: 1) High-throughput screening of in vitro infection systems to find novel genes (and eventually drug candidates) that affect cccDNA; and 2) Analysis of human patient samples to find novel biomarkers for cccDNA monitoring.

Yet most studies have investigated discrete cell states, and the investigation of intermediate and transitional cell types has been hampered by challenges associated with identifying these rarer cell states. However, characterising these intermediate cell states is important to enhance our understanding of cell state transitions during embryonic development. The increasing number of single-cell fetal transcriptomic and epigenomic atlases enables us to begin interrogating this question. Extending on our recently developed computational method, Cepo, this project will undertake a global approach to identify, investigate, and characterise transitional cell states.

Giant mitochondria are abnormal, extremely large mitochondria, observed in a variety of pathologies which are characterised by atypically arranged cristae, enlarged matrix granules and paracrystalline inclusions from unknown origin. Understanding the mechanism of mitochondrial gigantism and associated mitochondriopathies is essential given the importance of mitochondria to cellular function, human health and aging. This project involves the in vitro generation of giant mitochondria in human parenchymal cell lines to elucidate the ultrastructural mechanisms underlying their formation. Transmission electron microscopy will be applied to assess mitochondrial structural alterations in response to exogenous agents.

The vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, reduces DNA damage, immune suppression and skin tumours, as do some vitamin D analogs. Yet several potentially photoprotective agents examined have reduced UV-generated DNA damage and immune suppression, but not skin tumours. Testing for efficacy against skin tumours is a long (40 weeks) and expensive process. Thus, the aim of this project is to find readily measurable markers to identify agents that will reduce skin tumours, since reductions in UV-induced DNA damage and immune suppression alone are not necessarily predictive. Techniques include but are not limited to: primary cell culture, immunohistochemistry, western blot, image analysis.

You will work within a multi-disciplinary team that conducts gold standard clinical developmental assessments. Your research question will be whether an easy to administer biological assessment predicts the severity of neurodevelopmental delays in children. Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has diverse genetic, neurological, and environmental factors that contribute to its neurodevelopmental course. Childhood ASD is often accompanied by skin disorders, such as eczema, and other related atopic manifestations.

Conservative management such as neurodynamics physiotherapy combined with home-exercise has shown superior outcomes to ease pain and prevent future injuries. Self-administered home-exercises allow ease of access to treatment, decreased financial cost, and greater functional improvement - when patients' adhere to the home exercise program. Interactive 'serious' games for healthcare purposes (health games) provide patients with feedback about their condition, and can motivate, engage and increase patients' adherence to treatment. This project aims to develop a virtual reality (VR) based health game to assist hand therapists to motivate and engage their CTS patients to maintain their intervention programs, to help them manage pain and improve function. Research plan: 1) needs analysis interviews of hand therapists, 2) develop a VR health game using facilities within the FMH Media Lab e.g. Artec 3D scanners, gaming software (Bender, Unity), 3) evaluate the pilot game using a REDCap survey.

The uterus communicates with the implanting blastocyst via release of cellular contents and signals via a process of exocytosis. Precise mechanisms regulating exocytosis in uterine epithelial cells is currently unknown. Understanding exocytosis could advance development of a non-invasive uterine receptivity marker to improve pregnancy rates during IVF in humans and agricultural species. This project will use immunofluorescence microscopy, western blotting and ELISAs.

VA causes 1 in 4 cardiovascular deaths. The available treatment options for VA result in significant morbidity and are often ineffective. In an extraordinary interdisciplinary venture, a pioneering new treatment modality using radiation therapy, normally used for treatment of cancers, has been applied for VA.Multiple beams of high energy X-rays are converged to target the scar in the heart causing the heart rhythm problems.Although clinically very promising, many unanswered questions remain. In this project we will assemble a multidisciplinary team to understand the dose of radiation needed and how it affects function of heart cells(cardiac myocytes) We will use cardiac myocytes differentiated from pluripotent stem cells as our model system to identify pathways and functional parameters modified in response to radiation treatment.

Our laboratory found that by modifying a single amino acid residue on the Na+-K+ pump, it prevented adverse cardiac remodelling in a mouse model of hypertension. The effect of this modification in the blood vessel is yet to be determined. We therefore aim to test the hypothesis that this novel mouse model will be protected from hypertension-induced vascular dysfunction.

Catecholamines induce lipolysis during starvation, while in the presence of nutrients, insulin suppresses lipolysis. This is one of the most important actions of insulin in mammals and surprisingly little is known about the mechanism. Indeed, an impairment in this process may play a major role in diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis. We have recently discovered a novel regulator of lipolysis in fat cells. This project will explore how catecholamines and/or insulin regulate the function of this protein to coordinate the release of fatty acids from lipid droplets.

Build-up of plaque within arteries, in a process termed atherosclerosis, is the principal driver of CHD. Unlike stable plaques, unstable plaques are like 'ticking time bombs': they occur at more sites, are more aggressive and are more likely to rupture causing thrombus formation resulting in heart attacks and stroke. Preventing the rupture of unstable plaques remains a major unmet need in clinical cardiology. In this project, we will reprogram plaque cells by using anti inflammatory therapy to increase disease protective cells which will stabilize plaques and prevent rupture. We will be using advanced transgenic mice, scRNA-Seq, FACS and confocal microscopy.

We have shown that anti-inflammatory therapy in CV disease significantly reduced inflammatory trans-coronary cytokine levels.

Whilst very poorly understood, it is clear from clinical observations that this NKT cell/CD1d axis is very important in the control of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. This is because individuals with deficiencies in CD1d/NKT cells suffer from severe and sometimes fatal VZV infection. We have very recently discovered that VZV infection results in a profound downregulation of cell surface CD1d. This is the first evidence of VZV targeting this antigen presentation molecule and is consistent with the discovery of a novel immune evasion strategy. This project will build on this exciting new data to define the basis for VZV modulation of CD1d, including its functional consequences.

However, one area that is very poorly understood is the impact of HSV on natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are innate cells that can selectively lyse virally infected cells after activating receptors on NK cells bind to their respective ligands. Two such ligands that play important roles in NK cell functionality are CD112 and CD155. We have very recently discovered that HSV-1 infection inhibits both CD112 and CD155, providing the first evidence of a novel immune evasion strategy encoded by this virus. This project will build on this discovery, by seeking to define the means by which HSV-1 is able to exert this immunomodulatory phenotype, including determining whether HSV-1 modulation of CD112 and/or CD115 will inhibit NK cell recognition/functionality.

Project synopsis Mycobacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis and leprosy, remain a major health burden worldwide. Granuloma (a collection of inflammatory cells) is regarded as the epicentre of mycobacterial diseases. Yet, we know little about the types of immune cells and their spatial organisation within the lesions. This project will employ cutting-edge multiplex imaging platforms and bioinformatics tools to dissect the spatial dynamics of immune interactions in granulomas. By analyzing lesions at single cell level, the project will create a comprehensive immune landscape of mycobacterial granuloma in human and non-human primates. A deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the initiation, resolution and disintegration of granulomas in infected issues will provide new insight into host defence mechanism and advance biomarker and drug discovery.

Interestingly, mortality in individuals infected with these pathogens is often caused by immunopathology rather than uncontrolled pathogen replication. The hurdle in limiting immunopathology is that the same host molecules responsible for tissue damage are often essential for pathogen control. To understand such \"double-edged sword\" mechanisms in vivo, we have developed various animal models and technology platforms. In this project, you will use a novel mouse model to define regulatory events that mediate host survival in infection. Defining mechanisms that can mitigate tissue inflammation may lead to development of novel host-directed therapies for infectious diseases.

The aims of the project are: 1. to determine whether infection with earlier strains of the virus provides protection in terms of cellular immunity to subsequent strains and 2. whether there are differences in the long term anti-viral immune responses between adults and children to various variants. The project will involve in vitro cultures where peripheral blood mononuclear cells are incubated with variant specific spike protein peptide pools. Stimulated, antigen specific T cells will be detected by multi-colour flow cytometry to identify activated T cells using defined marker combinations. Furthermore, the phenotype of these virus specific T cells will be examined in detail. This project will provide better understanding of the dynamics of cellular immune response to the rapidly changing landscape of SARS-CoV2 infection.

While immunotherapy intends to restore anti-tumour immunity, it also often leads to immune activation in normal host tissue, resulting in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are a major barrier to the successful use of immunotherapies in oncology, contributing to significant morbidity and occasional mortality for an ever-increasing number of patients treated in the metastatic and adjuvant (post-operative) setting. An increasing number of antibodies targeting several different checkpoints are currently being trialled or developed. Moving forward, the use of combination therapies, currently only used in melanoma and kidney cancer, are likely to become more common and a lack of understanding of how irAEs develop will stifle the progress. This project will aim to understand the pathogenesis of skin related irAEs. The work will be performed in collaboration with Melanoma Institute and will incorporate novel technologies to map the immune landscape of affected skin tissues.

In 2020, it was the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer death. Despite an increase in therapeutics available to treat HCC, the rate of disease continues to climb worldwide. With the advent of immunotherapies, a greater understanding of the immune system is essential to improve prognostics outcomes. We have a collaboration with Centenary Institute and RPA Hospital to collect tumour and blood samples from HCC patients to analyse immune profile. The project on offer will use high-dimensional cytometry (spectral flow cytometry and mass cytometry) to interrogate circulating immune cells.

However, the role and function of MAIT cells in the context of viral infection is an emerging area that remains poorly understood. We have recently made the novel discovery that MAIT cells are directly infectable with Herpes simplex virus (HSV). We are uniquely placed at an international level to build on this exciting finding to define the fundamental basis of such infection, including determining its functional impact on MAIT cells. We hypothesise that infection will lead to functional impairment of MAIT cell function that will have a profound impact on understanding the immune response to HSV, including in the co-infection setting, where HSV and MAIT cell activating bacterial infections are a common occurrence.

MR1 presents ligands derived from bacteria and fungi, to MAIT cells (a subset of T cells that recognises ligands presented by MR1). However, these ligands are not made by viruses, and so the field has largely ignored viruses in the context of MR1 antigen presentation. We challenged this paradigm and recently published in high-ranking journals, Cell Reports and the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the first evidence that viruses can profoundly inhibit MR1 expression and function.

This is a consequence of reactivation of latent virus, present within the donor and/or recipient. Reactivation from latency results in newly replicating virus, which can cause a range of serious, often life-threatening complications, with the severity of virus reactivation from latency in these individuals broadly linked to the immune functioning of the host. However, the nature of the immune response when virus reactivates, including the types and number of various immune cells and related functions, has not been fully elucidated. This project will take advantage of newer technologies in immune cell profiling (eg mass cytometry), to define the nature of the immune cell subsets during virus reactivation in transplant recipients. You will join a team of researchers with unique expertise in such studies. The ultimate goal is to identify immune correlates of virus reactivation that will provide key diagnostic and/or prognostic information that will better inform intervention strategies to limit the impact of virus reactivation is transplant recipients.

This may be due the differential nature of cell death induced by HSV-1 in murine versus human cells. In murine cells, HSV-1 actively triggers the highly inflammatory cell death pathway known as necroptosis, and activation of necroptosis in solid tumours has been shown to robustly activate systemic anti-tumour immunity. In contrast in human cells, HSV-1 actively inhibits necroptosis, and the motif responsible for this inhibition (known as a viral RHIM) is intact within TVEC. In this project you will engineer a modified HSV viral vector that activates necroptosis in human cells. A head-to-head comparison of the necroptosis-inducing vector with the original parental vector will be performed using cancer cell lines and ex vivo patient tumour samples. You will measure the ability of each vector to stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production and cell death in these samples.

During infection, ZNF-MT activates the expression of dozens of innate immune genes. Pathogens have developed strategies to supress ZNF-MT to facilitate invasion and replication. In this proposal we will try to find a drug to re-activate the expression of ZNF-MT. To this aim, we will use both genetic approach and chemical library screening (e.g., Epigenetics Compound Library). We will also investigate how ZNF-MT activates the immune genes expression program.

If untreated, systemic amyloidosis can cause tissue damage, organ failure and death. Diagnosing systemic amyloidosis can be challenging due to a similar clinical presentation to other amyloid diseases. However, distinguishing between amyloid diseases is important because distinct treatments are required. This project will use a variety of molecular and cellular techniques to express and analyse amyloid light chains isolated from patients with systemic amyloidosis. The goal is to identify unique molecular signatures that cause misfolding of immunoglobulin light chains.

HIT causes severe thrombosis which may lead to limb gangrene and death. Patients with HIT develop antibodies to platelet factor 4, which activate platelets, neutrophils and monocytes by binding to their FcgRIIA receptor. There are still significant gaps in knowledge of the pathogenesis and treatment of HIT. Using an endothelial chip (Endo-chip), which simulates a human vessel, vascular thrombo-inflammation will be measured after exposure to antibody from patients with HIT and controls. The Endo-chip will be used to screen novel compounds, that we have developed, as potential treatments to prevent thrombotic complications in HIT.

Recent advances in treatment with (neo)adjuvant immune checkpoint therapies that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and/or programmed cell death protein 1 pathways have demonstrated clinical benefits. However, the response objectives were not universal and a subset of melanoma patients still die from their disease. We hypothesise that the infiltration of immune subtypes are distinct in each treatment, and the tumour-reactive T cells are interacting with stroma components such as the fibroblast causing less engagement with the tumour cells. In order to dissect the complex tumour microenvironment to address our hypothesis, we will utilise single cell technologies such as the CODEX multiplex immunohistochemistry and sequencing at our laboratory and Single-cell/Cytometry Core Facilities located at Charles Perkins Centre. We anticipate that the outcomes will facilitate the design of molecularly informed diagnostics and biomarker development.

Whilst very poorly understood, it is clear from clinical observations that this NKT cell/CD1d axis is very important in the control of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. This is because individuals with deficiencies in CD1d/NKT cells suffer from severe and sometimes fatal VZV infection. We have very recently discovered that VZV infection results in a profound downregulation of cell surface CD1d. This is the first evidence of VZV targeting this antigen presentation molecule and is consistent with the discovery of a novel immune evasion strategy. This project will build on this exciting new data to define the basis for VZV modulation of CD1d, including its functional consequences. You will work with a team of leaders in the field of virally encoded immune modulation.

However, one area that is very poorly understood is the impact of HSV on natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are innate cells that can selectively lyse virally infected cells after activating receptors on NK cells bind to their respective ligands. Two such ligands that play important roles in NK cell functionality are CD112 and CD155. We have very recently discovered that HSV-1 infection inhibits both CD112 and CD155, providing the first evidence of a novel immune evasion strategy encoded by this virus. This project will build on this discovery, by seeking to define the means by which HSV-1 is able to exert this immunomodulatory phenotype, including determining whether HSV-1 modulation of CD112 and/or CD115 will inhibit NK cell recognition/functionality. You will join a team of experts in virus encoded modulation of host immunity, and harness a number of techniques including viral culture, cell culture, flow cytometry and other immunological/cell biology techniques.

The Aubrey laboratory studies the neurobiology of pain and its associated behaviours. Although there is a robust framework for understanding pain circuits, the function and roles of specific cell types within these circuits are unknown, and there is a long way to go to reach the level of understanding needed to rationally develop effective new therapeutics to improve the lives of people living with pain. To bridge this gap, we use electrophysiological, opto- and chemogenetics, vector-mediated tracing, and behavioural approaches to understand the neural circuits that drive our responses to pain. We have one honours project available for semester 1, 2023. You will have the chance to carry out a behavioural project with immunohistochemistry.

Current treatment options are limited, and people can suffer for years or decades. The immune system is increasingly understood to have a role in chronic pain pathogenesis. The project will use the latest time-of-flight mass cytometry technology to assess inflammation in skin biopsies and blood taken from chronic pain patients compared to healthy controls. Using mass cytometry, the student will measure up to 40 inflammatory markers at once. This is a huge leap forward compared to just a handful of markers used in older technology. Blood markers and skin images will be analysed using the latest computer algorithms to assess information from all 40 markers and to look for interactions between immune cells and peripheral nerve fibres. It is expected that inflammatory changes in the skin and blood will correlate with pain intensity. Therefore, findings from these analyses will provide the most detailed picture of immunological changes in chronic pain to date and are highly likely to identify chronic pain markers that can be used to diagnose, predict pain severity, and direct the search for new and effective treatments.

PBM has been shown to relieve pain and be neuroprotective, however the mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of PBM in rats following chronic nerve pain and/or in symptomatic MPS IIIA mice, a model of the childhood dementia Sanfilippo Syndrome. Post-mortem analysis in the chronic nerve pain model will investigate immune cell infiltration to the nerve and spinal cord, as well as blood inflammatory markers; in the MPS IIIA study analysis will assess neuronal and mitochondrial health; synapse formation and neuroinflammation. We anticipate this study will provide overwhelming evidence of the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of PBM in the peripheral and central nervous systems.

These cells play essential roles in maintaining neuronal functions by providing energy, trophic factors, surveillance, and myelin sheath. Alpha-synuclein is a small protein encoded by SNCA, the firstly recognised risk gene associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). This protein is involved in numerous cellular functions. Despite the aggregated alpha-synuclein being a typical pathological feature of a spectrum of disorders (collectively called synucleinopathies, including PD), how glia are involved in this proteinopathy remains unknown.

Therapies target immune-inflammatory responses, but none are capable of promoting CNS repair. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) in microglia may be involved in activating myelin clearance activities, a crucial process to make way for re-myelination and repair [Cignarella F et al Acta Neuropathol 2020;140:513-534]. TREM2 is also expressed on C et al Acta neuropathol 2015;129:429-447; Filipello Neurobiol of TREM2 on microglia/macrophages within acute-active, chronic-active and inactive MS lesions in human tissues, using confocal microscopy and image analysis.

Polymorphisms in genes encoding components of innate immunity, that are expressed in myeloid and microglial cells, are linked to increased AD risk. One of these AD-linked genes encodes TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), and rare variants in this gene are linked to a 2 to 4 fold increased risk of AD. By characterising microglia in autopsy AD and control human brain sections, we found evidence that microglia are transiently activated in the evolution of AD plaque lesions at their earliest stages, but, in later stage lesions, microglial activation is dissipated or resolved (Paasila et al., 2020; Paasila et al., 2019; Davies et al., 2017). This work suggests that microglia activation may relate to a neuroprotective activity against early disease-triggering injury. This would be consistent with the genetic evidence that suggests partial loss of TREM2 function, potentially in microglia, contributes to AD risk. This honours project aims to take this work further by evaluating TREM2 distribution and its expression in microglial cells in early and late-stage AD lesions (Part 1). We hypothesise that we will see TREM2 upregulation at the earliest stages of AD lesion development. We will use immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis to address this hypothesis. Importantly TREM2 regulation involves its shedding from the plasma membrane. Increased secreted sTREM2 is found in the CSF of AD patients (Ewers et al., 2020). In the second part of this project, we aim to characterise the nature of sTREM2 from cultured macrophages (Part 2). We hypothesise that TREM2 will be found associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs). Circulating EVs may be significant for systemic signalling aspects of sTREM relating to health and disease.

For example, when an individual expects pain relief, an inert treatment can produce an analgesic response - i.e. placebo analgesia. While the phenomena of placebo analgesia has been well-documented, the basic circuitry underpinning their expression, in particular the circuits within the brainstem, remain largely undefined.

INVESTIGATING THE NOCEBO EFFECT IN RATS WITH CHRONIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN Project synopsis Background: The experience of pain is multidimensional, resulting from complex interactions between one's physiological condition, psychological state and social circumstances. What's more, an individual's perception of pain can also be influenced by their prior experiences, their current context and their expectations of pain. For instance, during the development of chronic pain, an individual may learn associations between their pain and particular stimuli, activities or situations, and then experience heightened pain when they re-encounter these contexts (or avoid the context altogether in fear of exacerbating their pain). This situation describes what is now more commonly referred to as the 'nocebo effect'. Recent studies have demonstrated that these learned pain responses can be evoked in rodents as well, allowing for precise dissection of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon, and forms the basis of this project. Aims: 1) To investigate to what extent the pain behaviours of neuropathically-injured rodents are due to prior learning and/or contextual expectations. 2) To identify the neural mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon and investigate potential methods to block this learning. Application: Identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie nocebo responses in chronic pain could allow for the development of novel treatments that block these harmful responses. This would significantly ease the psychological, social and economic burden of chronic pain in clinical populations. Significance: Chronic pain currently affects up to 20% of Australians. Its pathophysiology is still not well-understood. Identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of chronic pain is the first step in developing new therapies that effectively manage the disabling consequences of chronic pain.

Project synopsis Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that is now categorized as a disease state that affects over 3 million Australians. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood and presents an important barrier for the development of effective treatment strategies. There is now strong evidence that suggest changes in the brain involving neuronal-glial interactions may underlie the development and maintenance of the chronic pain state. Human and preclinical studies have shown astrogliosis (astrocyte activation) occurs following a nerve injury and continues with the persistence of the pain. However, it remains to be elucidated whether astrogliosis during the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain may be the driving mechanism for changes in neural activity that results in the transition from acute to chronic pain states. Current pharmacological treatments for chronic pain focus primarily on the altered neural function in patients and have been largely ineffective with poor clinical outcomes. Targeting glial cells may provide an alternative therapeutic option. Aims: 1) To investigate the activation pattern of astrocytes in preclinical models of neuropathic pain using combinations of MRI/PET imaging, autoradiography and histological/immunohistological techniques. 2) Investigate neuronal-glial interactions during the transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain in the pain pathways in a pre-clinical model of neuropathic pain. Application: The data from these experiments will form the basis for future in vivo PET/MRI imaging of the effects of pharmacological inactivation of astrocyte activation in the preclinical and clinical setting, which will allow for the real-time analysis of glial specific treatment options in chronic pain. Chronic pain is now categorized as a disease and affects over 3 million Australians. Its pathophysiology is not well-established which represents an important gap in the understanding of this disease and the exploration of effective therapies.

One potentially effective treatment option is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). SCS is delivered via an implantable neurostimulator delivering electrical pulses via a lead to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. Whilst pain signals are thought to be inhibited at the level of the spinal cord, the exact mechanism by which SCS works remains unknown. Spinal/supraspinal mechanisms are potentially involved in SCS induced pain relief, including brainstem endogenous analgesic circuits. Determining neural mechanisms responsible for SCS may provide details as to how the brain modulates on-going neuropathic pain. This project will involve human brain imaging techniques to determine underlying neural mechanisms associated with pain relief during SCS in chronic back pain sufferers.

This lack of remyelination could be related to the inadequate phagocytosis by microglia. Study with Lysolecithin model, it is found that modulation of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) receptor (Gpr109a) in microglia leads to the augmentation of phagocytosis and remyelination in aging mice.

In different cancers, the burden of IR can increase, suggesting a potential trigger for uncontrolled cell proliferation. We have previously found that mRNAs with retained introns (RI) are enriched with miRNA binding sites. However, the functional consequence of miRNA binding to RI is not known yet. To investigate further, we hypothesise a novel post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism via RI-miRNA interplay.

Neutrophil derived myeloperoxidase is thought to mediate citrullination and in this project we will use a mice air-pouch model of rheumatoid arthritis to determine if exogenous myeloperoxidase alone could induce citrullination of synovial-like antigens while intervening with myeloperoxidase inhibitors. Outcomes of this project could pave the way to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of RA, while identifying myeloperoxidase as novel key target for future therapies.

Thrombosis, or clot formation in the arteries, obstructs blood flow and underlies the pathology of ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism. For decades, the blood coagulation cascade has been known to be controlled by a series of proteolytic events converting inactive clotting factors into their active forms. We have discovered that blood coagulation is also regulated by the formation or cleavage of disulphide bonds in platelet receptors and clotting factors. Disulphide bonds are covalent bonds that form between two cysteine residues. They are sensitive to redox reactions and also to shear force in the circulation. Using cell-based assays, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and mass spectrometry, this project will investigate how disulphide bonds control the functions of platelet receptors and clotting factors in blood coagulation. Elucidation of disulphide-mediated mechanisms will enable the design of novel therapeutics to target thrombosis to reduce the risks of developing cardiovascular diseases.

Rhythmicity is generated by transcription factors in cells. Brain tumours often have disrupted circadian rhythms, and animal studies have shown that disrupted rhythms enhance tumour growth. It isn't clear how these rhythms are disrupted. Low oxygen environments are a hallmark of solid tumours. Our hypothesis is that hypoxia disrupts rhythms by activating a transcription factor known as Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF). Little is known about how HIF and circadian rhythms might interact in tumours. This project uses hypoxia models to study circadian rhythms in brain tumours. Students will investigate the molecular biology related to HIF, the molecular clock (CLOCK/BMAL1) and test anti-cancer drugs that inhibit these pathways.

Half of all heart failure patients have normal contraction, but impaired relaxation. This condition is known as \"HFpEF\". There are no effective therapies for HFpEF and we lack a clear understanding of how it develops. A common risk factor is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). OSA is common and is characterised by periods of intermittent hypoxia (low oxygen) in the blood and heart. The goal of this project is to better understand how OSA and hypoxia affect the heart and contribute to cardiovascular disease, like heart failure.

This project will investigate the effects of chromium, vanadium or nickel loading of immune cells. Specifically, monocytes and endothelial cells will be used to model bacterial-induced inflammation, Th1-type or Th2-type inflammation and the changes triggered by metals in lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates will be analysed using various modalities of vibrational spectroscopies, which are also sensitive to biomolecular conformational changes. These techniques will also allow us to define metal-induced changes in extracellular vesicles released from these immune cells.

Extracellular vesicles (EV) are membrane-enclosed vesicles that are released from all cell types and can transfer information to other cells, thereby influencing their function.

Adhesion of the bacterial biofilm, resistance of the biofilm to mechanical abrasion, and mechanical penetration of biofilms into periodontal pockets, are influenced by mechanical stiffness of plaque. While mechanical stiffness is a visibly important property of plaque, the effects of this on bacterial adhesion, proliferation, death and acid production are not well known. Given the importance of bacterial plaque in dental disease, we consider it important to explore the biological responsiveness of bacteria to stiffness. We believe this can provide insights into the mechanobiological role of dental plaque and dental disease, to eventually lead to the development of new and effective and targeted therapies that operate through varying mechanical plaque properties.

Despite the significant burden stroke has on the community, progress in the management of stroke continues to be unsatisfactory, with only one clinically approved thrombolytic agent for IS therapy. We have identified novel antithrombotic drug that are highly effective at promoting and facilitating thrombus dissolution and complete vascular reperfusion, without markedly increasing tail bleeding times. In this project, we will examine the safety and effectiveness of either a novel antiplatelet or novel anticoagulant, for their ability to facilitate reopening of the blood vessel and examine its impact on end-organ damage, particularly in the stroke context.

For example, PAD4 is expressed in neutrophils and is essential for the formation of NETs via PAD4-mediated histone citrullination and this process is abrogated by pharmacological targeting of PAD4. However, NETs can also damage host tissues particularly if the activity is persistent and the underlying microbial infection is controlled leaving the host tissue vulnerable to the potent oxidants being produced.

IR injury is characterised by poor blood flow in the micro-vasculature, exacerbating tissue ischaemic and organ injury. We have identified a new mechanism by which platelets and neutrophils cause microvascular obstruction. This previously unrecognised thrombotic mechanism is induced by the fragile membranes from dying platelets, that physically bridge adjacent neutrophils to facilitate neutrophil aggregation, leading to vessel occlusion. We can demonstrate that dying platelets convert neutrophils to a hyperadhesive inflammatory state. In turn, neutrophils can induce platelet death via production of oxidants. These new findings suggest a bidirectional communication mechanism operating between platelets and neutrophils, that may exacerbate microvasculature dysfunction and inflammation during IR injury. We are investigating this unique communication and its contribution to IR injury. These studies will use (i) in vitro functional assays to assess platelet death and neutrophil hyperadhesive function; (ii) mouse models of IR injury adopted to investigate microvascular dysfunction; and (iii) real-time in vivo imaging of platelet and neutrophil-platelet adhesion dynamics in the microvasculature during IR injury.

However, activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain produces intoxication (i.e., the cannabis \"high\"), limiting their therapeutic potential. Development of peripherally-restricted cannabinoid receptor agonists that do not enter the central nervous system could have significant value.

Compared to the hydrogen parent (two methoxy units), Austedo (two methoxy-d3 units) has attenuated metabolism, which halves dosing and improves patient compliance and outcomes. This landmark deuterium switch heralds the clinical potential of deuterium analogues. The iron chelator desferrioxamine B (DFOB) is used for patients with genetic blood disorders who need regular blood transfusions and develop secondary iron overload. The 15-min plasma half-life of DFOB necessitates a difficult-to-tolerate administration regimen, which reduces compliance. This project will synthesize (requirement/interest: organic chemistry) deuterated analogues of DFOB, and measure in vitro plasma half-life compared to DFOB. The project aims to deliver DFOB-d10 and per-deuterated DFOB-d41, as the most deuterated natural product on record.

There is a pressing need for therapeutics that protect the myelinating cells, oligodendrocytes, and promote remyelination of denuded axons. Our research has established an essential requirement for the signalling lipid S1P in oligodendrocyte protection and remyelination after injury. This is clinically important because S1P receptor agonists, which are used as immunosuppressants in MS therapy, may also confer myelin protection. Project Aim: Determine whether pharmacological activation of S1P receptors 1 and/or 5 protects oligodendrocytes against cytotoxic insults in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (mice), and the signalling mechanisms involved.

The aim of this project is to develop a structural model for transporters from the dual function glutamate transporter family (SLC1A). This family includes the human glutamate transporters (EAATs) and neutral amino acid transporters (ASCTs) that can also function as chloride channels. We aim to understand how these transporters malfunction in neurological disease states (eg. episodic ataxia) and in cancer. This information is then used to develop therapeutics that are both transporter-specific and subtype selective to treat these disorders.

Modulation of necroptosis has been proposed as a therapeutic option for some cancers. Sequence differences between mouse and human RIPK3 make it difficult to interpret the impact of drugs that modulate necroptosis when preclinical testing uses mice. The ICP6 protein from HSV1 inhibits necroptosis in human cells to maintain infection but triggers it in murine cells. This project will identify the key molecular details of the RIPK3:ICP6 interaction, by comparing interactions between ICP6 and human and murine RIPK3. The proteins will be produced recombinantly and examined using biochemical and biophysical assays that probe the stability of the complexes.

It has been identified in participants of sports such as boxing and football. The disease is defined by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons, around small blood vessels in the cerebral cortex. This project will involve preparation of tau filaments that are representative of CTE and Alzheimer's Disease pathology from recombinant protein. These will be screened to determine whether the molecular signature of CTE tau can be distinguished by fluorescent probes and a range of biochemical analyses.

SNPs in the V1aR gene are linked to social symptoms in autism spectrum disorder. The drug company, Roche, recently progressed a candidate V1aR antagonist into a phase II clinical trial, where it was safely tolerated and showed pro-social effects in autism spectrum disorder. This was progressed to a phase III trial where it failed to meet primary endpoints. As such, there remains a lack of clinically viable V1aR antagonists.

Macrophages play a pivotal role, promoting or suppressing atherogenesis and related inflammation, depending on their functional state. The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is expressed on macrophages and increases in response to stress and/or injury. It is associated with multiple biological functions including cholesterol transport and inflammatory response. There is growing evidence that modulation of TSPO can be cardioprotective. In this project we will identify whether treating macrophages with newly identified TSPO ligands can improve cell function, inflammation and cholesterol transport, potentially attenuating disease.

However, the impact of these exposures on diabetic complications (kidney disease) remains poorly understood. Dr Bansal has established a novel rodent model of developmental plasticiser exposure at ANU. The current findings from this model suggest that the developmental plasticiser exposure increases susceptibility to a postweaning Western diet exposure in the offspring and leads to development of diabetes. Such that upon a postweaning Western diet exposure the male offspring, whose mothers were exposed to a plasticiser diet pre-weaning, developed diabetes in adulthood (defined as fed blood glucose levels >20 mM across two consecutive days) compared to offspring of mothers fed a Control, or Western diet pre-weaning. This effect was sex specific as female offspring did not develop diabetes. We now aim to explore the effect of these developmental exposures on the long-term kidney function of the offspring in this established rodent model.

Project synopsis A major feature in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the loss of pancreatic -cell function. This manifests mainly as a reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our research interest is to understand the mechanisms of -cell failure in the pathogenesis of T2D. We have recently identified a novel gene, Cab45, critical for the insulin secretory pathway in -cells. We show that -cell specific deletion of Cab45 (both in cell lines and in mice) results in blunted glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The mechanism for this dysregulation of insulin secretion in Cab45 KO cells is not known. In this project we test the hypothesis that Cab45 is critical for the generation of high quality (secretory competent) insulin secretory granules and its deletion results in the generation of inferior quality secretory granules that cannot fuse with the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) use three-dimensional two-photon live-cell imaging to map the fusion events of individual insulin secretory granules with the cell membrane and (2) proteomics approaches to determine the molecular composition of insulin secretory granules in Cab45 KO and control cells. The project will give us key insight into the mechanism of -cell failure in the pathogenesis of T2D.

Their activation induces the secretion of proteins that promote platelet aggregation and inflammation. However, how these proteins interact in complexes has never been examined at the proteome-wide scale and many gaps in our knowledge exist. In the project, you will use crosslinking mass spectrometry based proteome analysis to identify protein-protein interactions at high resolution using the SydneyMS core facility. This crossling data will be used to build and validate protein complex structures derived either from existing crystal structures or structures predicted by Alphafold2 and Multimer.

Project synopsis BaDGE\u00ae technology was initially developed to enhance sound quality with the bionic ear. Pre-clinical studies have achieved regeneration of auditory neurons and improved hearing performance. This technology is now in clinical trial. This project seeks to advance cochlear gene therapy in addition to applications for gene augmentation outside the hearing space, through the unique BaDGE\u00ae platform. The aim is to improve the efficacy of BaDGE\u00ae through optimisation of electrotransfer parameters and electrode design using reporter genes such as GFP to quantify efficiency. The proposed project will also validate novel therapeutic gene constructs using immunohistochemical techniques. The readout of gene transfer efficiency and immunohistochemical analysis will be determined using epifluorescence and confocal microscopy.

The aim of this project is to develop a structural model for transporters from the dual function glutamate transporter family (SLC1A). This family includes the human glutamate transporters (EAATs) and neutral amino acid transporters (ASCTs) that can also function as chloride channels. We aim to understand how these transporters malfunction in neurological disease states (eg. episodic ataxia) and in cancer. This information is then used to develop therapeutics that are both transporter-specific and subtype selective to treat these disorders. This NHMRC funded project is a collaboration with researchers at McGill University, Canada and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA.

Project synopsis Offspring born to obese mothers and those born to mothers affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy are at risk of long-term metabolic health issues, including obesity and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Obese mothers themselves are at higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Previous studies have failed to identify methods of weight loss for women prior to pregnancy that can reduce perinatal morbidity and ameliorate adverse foetal programming effects. We aim to explore the effect of weight loss, either by diet modification or pre-pregnancy administration of the glucose-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist liraglutide, on appetite regulation within the brains of mothers and offspring using a rodent model. The animal component of this study has already been performed. Therefore, your role will be to perform laboratory-based experiments including Western blottings, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. You will be shown and guided on how to do these experiments. You will be working alongside alongside a team of over 10 researchers. You will be specifically looking at the role of the brain (specifically the hypothalamus) in weight regulation in the perinatal period, impacting outcomes for the mother and offspring exposed to maternal obesity and/or liraglutide. Your role will include analysis of data, interpretation of results and manuscript preparation. All work will take place at the Kolling Institute which is located on the Royal North Shore Hospital campus.

Treatment withdrawal can lead to rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk through accelerated bone resorption by osteoclasts. We have shown that osteoclasts undergo fission to form an intermediate and distinct osteoclast lineage cell, the osteomorph. Osteomorphs and osteoclast pre-cursors rapidly re-fuse to form aggressive osteoclasts, driving bone loss associated with Dmab withdrawal. This honours project will examine TNF-alpha inhibition and CTLA-4 stimulation as novel approaches to minimize bone loss post-Dmab and to study their effects on osteomorph-osteoclast dynamics. The student will gain proficiency in mammalian cell culture and live cell imaging, which will be used to examine osteoclast dynamics, fission and fusion.

Inflammation is increasingly implicated as a key biological driver behind CVD pathology however inflammation-targeting drugs (immunotherapy) are not routinely used in clinical management of the disease. This project will work across a team of bioengineers, vascular biologists, and clinicians to study new biomaterials-based platforms to help localise the delivery of immunotherapies, to improve their effectiveness, longevity, and safety for vascular applications. Key elements of the project include further development of a proprietary nanoparticle platform, delivery of anti-inflammatory agents in cell culture models and ultimately evaluation of safety and efficacy of the best agents in pre-clinical models.

You will investigate an intriguing observation that membrane cholesterol appears to modulate the mechanism of inhibition, which has implications for a wide range of drug discovery programs and understanding cell physiology. A range of projects can be designed around this idea and can include: 1. Site-directed mutagenesis studies to understand how the transporter responds to both inhibitor and cholesterol interactions; 2. Compare the activity of cholesterol with that of a series of steroids with the aim of identifying novel secondary modulators of glycine transport.

Endothelial dysfunction can occur for many reasons including the implantation of medical devices, vessel injury, high blood pressure, elevated lipids, or inflammation. Recent evidence has demonstrated that alterations in flow conditions to cause endothelial dysfunction, results in endothelial cell reprogramming. This project aims to understand the effect of different stimuli on endothelial cell phenotype and dysfunction. Cells will be cultured and characterised under static conditions with a range of stimuli. Successful candidates will be evaluated under flow conditions in microfluidic, Organ-on-a-chip models already established by the Waterhouse lab at the Charles Perkins Centre using immunofluorescence and microscopy techniques.
