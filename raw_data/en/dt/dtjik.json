The thyroid is an important gland in our body that regulates our metabolism, growth, and development. When the thyroid is out of balance and not functioning properly, it can lead to a variety of health issues, including weight gain, fatigue, and depression. Crystals have been used throughout time to promote healing and balance in the body. While traditional medical treatments can be effective, some people turn to holistic treatments, such as crystal healing, to support their thyroid health.

Hormones are energy, and if they are not balanced, it can lead to a host of problems, including thyroid issues.

Crystals work by interacting with the energy centers of the body and promoting balance, harmony, and healing. If you are struggling with thyroid issues or any other hormone-related problems, incorporating healing crystals into your routine may be worth considering.

Personal Experience of our founder, Erin Hollon Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism after experiencing a long period of poor health, digestive issues, and extreme fatigue. After receiving my diagnosis, my next step was to find a doctor who could help me manage my condition and eventually improve it. I was determined not to live the rest of my life in a cycle of medication, exhaustion, weight fluctuation, and hair loss. Fortunately, I was able to find an amazing doctor who combined standard medical practices with holistic supplements and techniques. Throughout our appointments, she repeatedly asked me how I was feeling emotionally and how my stress levels were. At first, I kept insisting that I was fine, but then it finally hit me - I was actually stressed all the time. I just didn't know it because it was always there, lurking beneath the surface of my external calm. It was at this moment that I realized I needed to address my stress levels in order to truly heal from my disease. I started researching natural healing methods to help reduce stress and stumbled upon crystals. Despite having tried almost every natural method out there, crystals were something I had never attempted. I purchased an Aquamarine crystal, wrapped it to create a necklace, and wore it every day as a reminder to myself that my health was more important than anything else. Any time I felt stress level rising, I held the crystal and repeated an affirmation until the anxiety faded away. It was like walking myself back from the brink of an stress-induced meltdown. While it helped a little bit, I still felt like I needed more help to speed my healing process. Desperate for additional natural remedies to support my hormone health and balance, I reached out on Facebook to see if anyone had any suggestions. A friend recommended an [essential oil blend]that she had used herself, and I immediately ordered and began applying them twice daily. This began my year-long journey towards continually reducing stress and improving my health. Within a few months of incorporating the crystals and essential oil blends into my routine, I was able to go off my medication. Over time, I continued to feel better and better, until I had more energy than I could ever remember having in years. Additionally, my hair grew back, my weight balanced out, and I wasn't feeling stressed nearly as much anymore. Throughout the years since, I've found other crystals, oils, supplements, and stress-relief practices that help me to maintain optimal health of my mind, body and spirit. And I've created tailored [thyroid support jewelry]and [crystal + oil rollers]to make it even easier for others to get the same results I've experienced. Looking back on my journey, it's shocking to think that I once lived in constant pain, with low energy levels, and never-ending stress. However, thanks to my doctor, my determination, and my use of crystals and essential oils, I was able to overcome my hypothyroidism and regain my health. The experience of discovering the healing powers of crystals and essential oils was so impactful that it became the inspiration for my wellness business. Today, I am passionate about sharing my journey and helping others to achieve optimal health and wellness through natural remedies. "}
