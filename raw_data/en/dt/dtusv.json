Examples will include cystitis, PMS, endometriosis, PCOS, menopause, anxiety, depression, insomnia and more. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Restorative Wildcrafting in the Pacific Northwest Original Date: May 16, 2014 Presenter: Nome McBride Going well beyond sustainability, wild harvesting can actually increase the range, health and productivity of wild patches of medicinal plants. Using examples of plants from the Pacific Northwest bioregion, this class will cover ethical wildcrafting, harvesting for crop health, post-harvest methods of dissemination and plant reproduction. Among the issues we will discuss are reduced stand tending by first peoples in recent centuries; modern logging techniques affecting wildcrafters; global demand for herbal products; organic cultivation of native and wild crops for sustainability and repopulation. This class also introduces grading a botanical by its growth type, concentration rate, regeneration type and global range. This grading helps wildcrafters assess their impacts and ensure and restorative harvest. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Using Plants for Back and Joint Injuries Original Date: May 16, 2014 Presenter: Jim McDonald The number of people suffering from chronic back pain in this country is staggering. Chronic pain has far-reaching impact on all aspects of wellness, deeply affecting the spirit as well as the body. Conventional treatment usually involves strong pain killers and surgery. Both of these approaches come with significant side effects and risks, and often do not yield the relief they promise. The world of plant medicines offers another avenue to address these injuries, sometimes providing radical benefits in restoring wellness to beleaguered backs. Herbalist Jim McDonald will share his experiences using plants to address back and joint injuries, emphasizing the underlying patterns and imbalances too often left unaddressed. 2.0 pain management CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Scientific Approaches to Constitutional Assessment Original Date: May 16, 2014 Presenter: Eric Yarnell, ND This talk will use chronic prostatitis as a model to discuss differentiation of health problems based on scientific principles and research as an example of modern-day \"constitutional assessment.\" While this approach lacks some of the features of traditional constitutional assessment, it shares some surprisingly similar features. Should herbal practitioners consider merging traditional and modern constitutional assessment? Is this, in fact, what many herbal practitioners already are doing much of the time? 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Botanical Medicines in the Stages of Fever Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Paul Bergner Fever generally has a series of distinct stages, the early stage when the temperature is rising, a middle stage when the temperature is at its peak, an intermittent stage when it fluctuates, and finally, a period of recovery after the fever has passed. Individual herbs and complex formulation should be selected according to the presenting symptoms in the different stages. We will cover differentials in herbal actions and materia medica and describe formulation strategies to address the different stages of fever. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Northwest Analogs to Common Trade Herbs Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Nome McBride Learning to heal people also involves learning to heal the land all around us. As herbalists and doctors we commonly are directed to herbs from exotic locales. While these may sometimes be indicated in a global health crisis, in many cases a locally abundant or native botanical can be equal to or more effective than these far-flung imports. Herbal globalization has overlooked the abundance right before us - at the cost of reduced quality through storage and handling, customs fumigation and treatment, and the true cost in transport and versus face cost through large brokers. Learning to use these bioregional plants makes our apothecaries resilient and gives practitioners a chance to instill bioregional pride and conservation ethics in our patients. Specifically, we will explore permitting. Using specific examples, organoleptic tasting and cited research, this class will cover how to incorporate these bioregional analogs herbs into practice. A brief materia medica highlighting differences among species within each genus will be given for each botanical, along with harvest methods and sustainability considerations. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Differentiating Calming Herbs Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Jillian Stansbury, ND We will review the general and specific indications for commonly used Humulus. This class also will detail modern molecular and clinical research that supporting folkloric usage and indications, as well their use for psychiatric disorders, addiction and opiate withdrawal \u2014 in combination with or instead of pharmaceutical drugs. 2.0 CEUs (1.75 general and 0.25 pharmacy) for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Humoral Differentials for GI Herbs Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Paul Bergner Herbal medicines used for the digestive tract have characteristic qualities of hot, cold, moistening or drying, in the terminology of classical medicine. Giving GI herbs without matching their humoral or energetic qualities to the presenting symptoms of the patient can lead to patient discomfort, aggravated conditions and therapeutic failures. We will cover the signs and symptoms of the humors in the digestive tract, and the humoral properties of the most important categories and materia medica for the GI tract, with formulation strategies to prevent adverse humoral effects. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Treating Urinary Tract Infections with Herbs Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Eric Yarnell, ND This open panel is moderated by Dr. Yarnell. We all want to hear about successes and intriguing and unexpected outcomes (for example, efficacy of an unusual herb); this session offers and opportunity to evaluate why some cases don't respond. Dr. Yarnell will provide a few examples from his practice, including: a case when herbs worked and antibiotics didn't in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer; the use of herbs to break a cycle of recurrent UTIs and eliminate antibiotics; and a time herbs didn't work in what seemed like a run-of-the-mill case and why this probably. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Differentiation of Diuretic Herbs Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Eric Yarnell, ND There are many herbs available that are diuretic. This talk will focus on differentiating between them. This will include looking at their relative potencies as diuretics, their relative degree of tonic effect, and their additional actions to help practitioners choose which herbs to use with specific patients. The use of diuretic herbs for kidney stone prevention, ureteral colic treatment, urinary tract infection prevention and treatment, and hypertension treatment will be illuminated with these differentiating factors in mind. Case examples will be used to illustrate points throughout. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Preserving Culture Through Documentation of Herbal Medicine Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Laura Ash Traditional knowledge, specifically traditional medicine, is being lost around the globe due to the modern diaspora of indigenous people from their native lands to modern cities, rapid acculturation, and the loss of traditional languages and oral traditions. With the loss of traditional medicine comes the loss of a key to a creation story, a beginning - and potentially the foundation of a community's identity. Using examples from her recent collaboration with the Maasai of the Ngorongoro Highlands of Northern Tanzania, Laura shows how intellectual property law and herbal anthropology as tools to protect this precious heritage, fight bio-piracy around the world and preserve health sovereignty. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Case Panel: Pelvic Pain Original Date: May 17, 2014 Presenter: Moderated by Tania Neubauer, ND 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Endocrine Systems 18, 2014 Presenter: Jillian Stansbury, ND This class will offer an illustrated review of some of the most-studied and well-used herbs for endocrine disorders based on organ systems. We will survey herbs specifically indicated for thyroid, adrenal, and males and female reproductive disorders, looking both at folkloric herbal healing traditions and mechanisms of action based on modern research. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM Roots, Maps and Interactions: Self-Healing and Living Systems, Ancient to Future Original Date: May 18, 2014 Presenters: Lori Beth Stargrove, ND, and Mitchell Bebel Stargrove, ND, LAc Herbal medicine is a core forum for understanding the history and developing the application of natural medicine and person-centered health. This presentation reviews the mythology and history, world views and philosophies that shaped the contrasting currents of physician and folk practitioners, countryside and city health practices, and the respective roles of self-healing and medicine. Models and maps will be used to illustrate key mythopoetic and scientific concepts of person-centered health dynamics, three-worlds metaphysiology, therapeutic terrains, collaborative care, and interactions at the levels of therapies and relationships. Examples will illustrate these principles and tools in plant medicine, methods of organizing perceptual and conceptual input and weaving multidisciplinary therapies into an personalized and evolving therapeutic strategy. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Surviving Sinusitis (and other Catarrhal Calamities) Original Date: May 18, 2014 Presenter: Jim McDonald Allergies, infections and chronic inflammation of the sinuses are common maladies many people struggle with. While most conventional treatments involve antibiotics, suppressive drugs and often surgery, many common herbs can effectively restore health and tone to the sinuses, ease discomfort, and fight both bacterial and frequently overlooked fungal infections. Herbalist Jim McDonald will elaborate on using energetic approach to choose among these plants, and will discuss other therapies that can give relief to sinu-suffering. 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Cost: US$ 70.00 Case Panel: Lupus-like Symptoms Original Date: May 18, 2014 Presenters: Panel moderated by Paul Bergner 2.0 general CEUs for NDs approved by OBNM - Embodying the Elements of Care: Making, Becoming and Being Medicine Original Date: May 18, 2014 Presenter: Martha Matthews Libster, MSN, PhD Medicine-making is rooted in many cultural healing traditions. Throughout history we find at the center of medicine-making, a knowledge of the way in which the elements of all matter, including the Self of the healer, as ether, fire, air, water and earth can be embodied in care. Making medicine is a healing practice in which the ancient Hermetic maxim \"As Above, So Below\" can be demonstrated as healing art, science and spiritual practice. Today, however, the act of writing a prescription may be the only connection between practitioners and their remedies. Herbal medicine-making tradition, in which the \"medicine\" of the maker can be embodied in simple caring acts \u2014 such as infusing a tisane, applying a compress, preparing a footbath and simmering syrup \u2014 offers an opportunity for meaningful reform of practice. Drawing upon botanical practice, the science of caring and pattern recognition and lessons learned from primary historical research, this session focuses on skills associated with making, becoming and being medicine. Learn making medicine from caring communities during the \"lost decades\" in American history, specifically the Shakers, who were renowned medicine makers and healthcare reformers \u2014 founders of American pharmacy as we know it today. Become medicine as you participate in the ancient ritual of tea tasting and learn to prepare and apply baths and topical remedies, which serve as chalices for the embodiment of the elements of Self. Explore the science of demonstrating care and the art of peacemaking, the expression of being medicine as a living ethic that serves as a foundation for sustainable healthcare reform. 2.0 ethics CEUs for NDs "}
