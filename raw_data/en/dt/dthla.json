It is said the crystals act as conduits for healing, allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body, while negative, disease-causing energy flows out of the body. As a crystal healer, you have a gift for healing and a passion for alternative medicine. But it's important to remember that, although your treatment is fairly low risk, accidents are a part of a running a business. Even accidentally pouring hot coffee over a client or a client tripping over your bag in a hallway could result in a compensation claim that could threaten the life of your business. Because we specialise in the beauty and holistic industries, we understand the risks you face and have tailored our policy to suit your needs. Our Salon Gold Beauty Therapist and Salon Gold Holistic Therapist insurance policies include public liability cover automatically, which means an accident doesn't have to mean the end of your dream.
