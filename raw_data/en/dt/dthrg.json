Dry cupping stimulates the skin through suction while the skin remains unbroken. This electronic motor set was used for Dry Cupping Vacuum Therapy. It comes with 20 glass cupping vessels of varying grades. They were placed upon the skin. The appropriate amount of suction was then applied via the motor. Cupping was described as early as 281CE within Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Cupping in TCM aims to aid the circulation of stagnant qi energy and remove toxins from the body. Hollowed animal horns were originally used. These were replaced over time by bamboo and glass cups. The apparatus was made by Hitachi in Japan. It shows how modern technology has been incorporated into traditional techniques.
