Both types are sweet and pleasant tasting, which makes it easy to administer to children. When possible, avoid touching the tablets with your fingers. Use a spoon. - Adults and Children: Take 3 tablets 3 times a day or as directed by your practitioner. In acute cases, take every hour until relieved, Doses are the same for all ages. If no improvement after 3 doses, discontinue the remedy. Small Children - When possible, avoid touching the tablets with your fingers. Use a spoon. - Adults and older children are encouraged to let the tablets dissolve under the tongue. Younger children can let them dissolve in their mouths. Eating and Drinking - If your child is too small to chew the medicine, place 3 pellets in 1/2 glass of water and let stand for 5 minutes. If you are using the hard pellets, they will not dissolve immediately, but the water will become medicated. Stir ten times, and give 1/4 teaspoonful (or dropperful) - Avoid eating or drinking 10 minutes (if possible) before and after taking your homeopathic remedy. With a baby or small child this is not always possible. Not to worry. Substances to Avoid Persistent or Worsening Symptoms - During the time period that you are taking a remedy, it is best to avoid coffee, chocolate, camphor, eucalyptus, mint and other strong smelling substances (mint toothpaste is okay). Improving Symptoms - If symptoms persist more than three days or worsen, discontinue the medicine and consult your doctor. - If no improvement after 3 doses, stop taking the remedy. Storing and Traveling - As your condition improves, take your homeopathic medicine less often (1-2 times a day). - When you are substantially better, discontinue the medicine. - If you store your kit away from electrical appliances, strong smelling substances and extremes of temperature, the shelf life of the remedies is greatly extended. - If possible, have your medicines be hand-checked at the airport, instead of going through the x-ray machine. | | "}
