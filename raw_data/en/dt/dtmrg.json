For over a decade, London-born DJ and cannabis activist [Chelsea Leyland](https://www.instagram.com/chelsealeyland/?hl=en) experienced debilitating period pain, visiting the emergency room intermittently as she coped with fainting and vomiting spells\u2014and tried to get to the bottom of it all. \"I waited over 10 years to receive a diagnosis,\" says Leyland of finally learning [she has endometriosis](https://www.vogue.com/article/chelsea-leyland-pregnancy-loss-awareness), a disorder that affects [1 in 10 women](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/endometriosis#:~:text=Endometriosis%20affects%20one%20in%2010,of%20women%20who%20are%20infertile.) in which the tissue that lines the woman's uterus grows outside of the uterus, causing pelvic pain and abnormal periods (including excessive cramps and heavy menstrual flow). Medically, the only solutions offered to Leyland were, first, birth control and subsequently an unsuccessful surgery, leaving her searching desperately for other ways to manage her symptoms. \"I began to look towards alternative medicine,\" says Leyland. As someone who also suffers from epilepsy and has found relief in using medical cannabis, she knew that becoming her \"own best advocate\" was the only way forward. \"I discovered the power of botanical medicine, acupuncture, and other different healing modalities, and my endometriosis started to improve beyond anything I could have imagined,\" she says. The downside? \"I was using a combination of so many different botanical products and supplements, but it took so much effort to find these solutions that had no substantial medical input or proof of safety or efficacy, and that made me nervous,\" she continues. That's when Leyland decided it was time to take matters into her own hands. Launching today, [Looni](https://looni.co/) is a new menstrual-health company dedicated to improving period literacy and offering support through education and innovative, science-backed offerings. It's cofounded by Leyland and Tatiana Steel, a six-year veteran of Goldman Sachs who worked across consumer, retail, and health care investment banking and is now dedicating her life to providing the period support that would've been game-changing to her own struggles growing up. Leyland and Steel are far from alone in grappling with their periods and the toll menstrual symptoms take on the body: According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/286787/occurrence-of-menstrual-pain-or-pms-in-the-us-trend/), 31.31 million women reported period pain or PMS in 2020 in the U.S. alone. Beyond a physical and mental effect, menstrual pain can prevent people from fully participating in their lives: [One study found that](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e026186) debilitating period symptoms contribute to, on average, up to nine days of total lost productivity per year, potentially impacting women's work, education, or social lives. As a brand and platform, a key pillar of Looni is menstrual awareness as wellness, celebrating periods as a sacred part of the female experience and shedding the stigmas surrounding them. \"We've been blown away at the lack of accessible conversation around the things that have plagued us as women\u2014pregnancy loss, endometriosis, what vaginal discharge is normal, sex on your period, the list goes on,\" says Leyland. \"Education and community is a large part of what we're building and offering to our customers. Periods shouldn't be painful\u2014if you're experiencing intense lows, cravings, or pain, it's likely worth exploring. The cycle itself isn't the problem. Instead, it's a doorway to revealing a problem.\" The way Looni sees it, a vital next step in addressing these problems is cleaner and safer solutions for menstrual health, designed by those who have periods. \"Most solutions on the market had been developed by people who haven't had periods and therefore don't understand the symptoms that we as women suffer from, such as mood instability and tender breasts,\" explains Steel. \"We saw a strong need for research-backed solutions and education, alongside a team that wasn't afraid to tackle outdated taboos.\" Developed alongside a team of female practitioners\u2014including Felice Gersh, an integrative gynecologist, and Jaclyn Tolentino, a functional-medicine doctor specializing in hormone optimization\u2014from both a conventional and holistic perspective, Looni's debut product is [Balance Beam Mood Complex](https://looni.co/products/balance-beam-mood-complex), a supplement designed to target the hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. \"When your hormones are balanced, you experience fewer mood swings, cravings, and overall irritability,\" says Leyland. All its ingredients are backed by clinical research, including vitamin B6, which has been [shown to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27878/) treat PMS; L-theanine, a [known](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836118/) stress reliever; and made from the seeds of the African Griffonia simplicifolia plant, which increases serotonin levels and promotes healthy mood balance. On the horizon is the brand's Cycle Soothe Breast Balm, which will help ease tender-breast pain with tension-relieving arnica and anti-inflammatory terpenes and phytocannabinoids. \"After more than 70 years of the same old blanket pharmaceutical solutions, women deserve better, more thoughtful solutions,\" says Steel of the mission at the heart of Looni's debut offering and what's coming down the pipeline. \"It's time for the products and research being done within the category to be led by those actually experiencing the issue,\" adds Leyland. Marrying radical candor, integrative expertise, and cutting-edge science, Looni is already making good on its aim to fight society's long-held stigmas and push the needle forward for menstrual health. \"Most women are operating from a knowledge deficit about their bodies,\" says Steel. \"We hope to provide access to every woman looking to achieve complete body literacy and unlock [their] full potential. It's a hefty task, but one that we wake up excited to fight for "}
