However, old-fashioned gardening is still a thing with container gardening, an old concept that's receiving some renewed popularity. When it comes to organic gardening with containers, you want the right container. As a general rule of thumb, organic gardeners are looking for something that is not only safe for hosting your plant but is also environmentally safe. The primary focus on containers for organic gardening is choosing something that is completely free of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, or any other synthetic chemicals. Containers that are renewable resources are a plus but if you are going with something previously used, you'll need to discover whether or not there is something residual in there that shouldn't be. It's not as if you can see the residue of a past fungicide, so what do you do? Choosing the best containers for organic gardening is important for keeping things organic and the purpose of this list is to show you what the best containers are going to be. [show](#)] What to Look for in a Container for Organic Gardening There are several things that are worth keeping an eye out for. When it comes to environmentally friendly containers, you know that you are going to get something that's either natural or constructed out of sterile plastics. - Sterile Plastics - All Natural Grow Bags - Natural Wood Containers - Natural Stone Containers - Recycled Plastics BPA Free, Food Safe Plastics The biggest benefit of using plastic containers is the cost but be careful what you buy. Sterilized plastics are plastics that have undergone what is called \"autoclaving.\" Autoclaving is the process by which the plastic is blasted with super hot steam. The heat of the steam sterilizes the plastic completely while the blasting process helps to wash off the residue. All-natural containers are always going to be your best bet. With plastics, you get what you get or you have to sterilize them. Natural containers need none of the above and all they will come into contact with is what you introduce to them. Recycled plastics are a decent option but, like regular plastics, you have to be sure that they are properly sterilized. When you purchase recycled plastics they are generally sold without any kind of harmful byproducts. They are recycled plastic after all, and the entire goal is to embrace renewable resources. That kind of focus always leans towards the avoidance of synthetic chemicals that will affect the growth and development of your gardening plants.
