Prerequisite or corequisite: BIOL 120, or with instructor approval. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) BIOL 140: Bio Inq: Gene Editing (Biological Inquiry Seminar: Gene Editing.) For years, scientists have been able to modify the food we eat, construct better vaccines, and improve cancer treatment through genetic manipulations. However, within the past few years, we have entered an new era where even the genes of our children can be edited, due to a new technique called CRISPR that is incredibly precise, efficient, and relatively inexpensive. This technique may have positive outcomes, like allowing mosquitoes that are malaria-resistant to survive in the wild and enabling us to eat beef or chicken without ever raising an animal. This course explores the molecular basis for how genes are cut and edited; the basis of the CRISPR system which originated as an immune response in bacteria; the myriad potential uses of CRIPSR in current and future research; and the ethical dilemmas that certainly will result. Students have an opportunity to cut bacterial genes themselves in the laboratory. The course includes discussions, lectures, and a special emphasis on student presentations. Prerequisite or corequisite: BIOL 120, or with instructor approval. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences and Speaking requirements.) BIOL 141: Bio Inq: Health Science Reporting (Biological Inquiry Seminar: Health Science Reporting) The scientific method requires researchers to build upon knowledge generated by others. Much of this knowledge is disseminated through scholarly articles in scientific journals. Because scientific papers are often complex, including technical terms and statistical analyses, misunderstandings are common. News and popular media broadcast medical and health findings to the general public, frequently oversimplifying or misinterpreting the science. In this course, students will critique medical journalism and medical research by comparing popular reporting to original scientific sources. Emphasizing reading and understanding of scholarly literature in medicine, students will develop their capacity to recognize, comprehend, and critique medical research. Class activities will include lectures, discussion, student presentations, and written exercises. Prerequisite or corequisite: BIOL 120, or with instructor approval. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) BIOL 142: Bio Inq: The Biology of Dogs (Biological Inquiry Seminar: The Biology of Dogs) Dogs are not only 'man's best friend,' but are increasingly used as biological models for research.
