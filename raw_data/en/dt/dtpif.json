L-Citrulline is one of the three dietary amino acids in the urea cycle, alongside L-arginine and L-Ornithine. Taking L-Citrulline increases plasma levels of ornithine and arginine and improves the ammonia recycling process and nitric oxide metabolism. Consequently, it is used in areas where nitric oxide is relevant, namely athletic performance, and vascular health. What are the benefits of Citrulline Malate? In general, much research suggests a modest reduction in blood pressure and improvement in blood flow from chronic citrulline supplementation, particularly for those with hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Limited research suggests an improvement in power output, a reduction in fatigue and improved endurance for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Beta Alanine is for the athlete who wants more\u2014more reps, speed, muscle, focus, and more personal records. As the leading ingredient in the top sports nutrition formulas, beta-alanine helps athletes of all abilities push past plateaus and reach peak performance. If your goal is to constantly redefine what your \"best\" looks like, then beta alanine is your fuel. 2.5g BETAINE ANHYDROUS Betaine Anhydrous? Betaine, or TMG (trimethylglycine), is a naturally occuring compound that is an active metabolite of choline or 'end product.' Although found naturally in foods like beets, spinach, avocados, bacon, fish, shrimp and various types of milk (just to name a few), there isn't enough betaine in the afformentioned foods to provide the benefits that we're after. This is why supplementation is not only beneficial but necessary to experience the real health benefits. What are the Benefits of Betaine Anhydrous? Betaine anyhdrous has been proven by researchers to aid in multiple essnetial functions throughout the body. Most importantly, betaine aids in decreasing levels of homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine can cause damage to the inside of your arteries, increasing your risk of the formation of blood clots. While betaine has clear cardiovascular benefits, it's also involved in liver function, cellular production, and helping make carnitine.

L Lauren Gattis Hands Down Best Pre-Workout I have taken Stage One before, but due to travel and lifestyle changes had taken a break from it - that is a BIG regret of mine. After ordering it just a few weeks ago, it arrived promptly, properly packaged and has a fresh new look and label. However, same amazing flavor and pre-workout pump. Stage One is perfect if you're lifting heavy in the gym, doing a group HITT workout or doing a day of cardio. It's clean, refreshing and gives you that extra spark to perform your best. Stage One is to working out as coffee is to working - you simply can't do your best work without them either of them. So, if you're looking for a new pre-workout or simply need the nudge to get back in the Clean Victory bandwagon, here's your sign! Order it today and have a better workout tomorrow & every day after!
