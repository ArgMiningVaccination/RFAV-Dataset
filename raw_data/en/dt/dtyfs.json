(e) If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner has been or might be made, but the coroner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the post -mortem investiga tion into the decedent's cause or manner of death, the coroner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery. After consultation, the coroner may deny the r ecovery. (f) The coroner and procurement organization shall enter into an agreement establishing protocols and procedures governing relations between them when the coroner believes that the recovery of a part for anatomical gift from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner could interfere with the post -mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death or the documentation or preservation of evidence.

New pesticides are continually being discovered or synthesized which are valuable for the co ntrol of pests, and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use or nonuse, of any pesticide, is vital to the public health and welfare and the environm ent both immediate and future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for registration of pesticides and devices. 35-7-353. Board of certification.

One (1) or more of the law enforcement officers who made the seizure shall testify under oath regarding the facts and circumstances which established probable cause to seize the property. The hearing shall be recorded by sound, sound-and-visual or stenographic means. If the court determines, based upon the evidence presented, that at the time of the seizure: (i) Probable cause did not exist to seize the property, the court shall order the property to be immediately returned to its lawful owner or one (1) of the persons from whom it was seized; or (ii) Probable cause existed to seize the property, the court shall order that the commissioner may file an action for the forfeiture of the property.

All forfeiture proceedings or actions shall be brought by the commissioner. (e) Property taken or detained under this section shall not be subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of the commissioner subject only to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the proceedings. When property is seized under this act, the commissioner shall place the property under seal or otherwise assure the property is maintained under conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value or may sell the property and hold the proceeds thereof if the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value until the forfeiture proceedings have become final as to all parties and all rights of appeal have been exhausted. In order to preserve the property, if cash, the commissioner may deposit funds into a demand deposit account at an institution loc ated within the state of Wyoming. (f) Before a forfeiture action may be filed and no later than thirty (30) days from the date of entry of an order finding probable cause pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall serve a notice o f seizure and intended forfeiture upon any third party, ascertained after reasonably diligent inquiry, known to have an interest in the property.

(j) The complaint to seek forfeiture of property under this section shall describe w ith reasonable particularity: (i) The approximate value of the property; (ii) The facts giving rise to the seizure or custody; (iii) The name and position of the person making the seizure or taking the property into custody; (iv) The name and addre ss of the owners of the property or those persons who were in possession of the property at the time of the seizure; and (v) The manner in which all parties reasonably known to have an interest in the property seized were served in accordance with subsec tion (f) of this section. (k) In the action for the forfeiture of property, the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to establish by clear and convincing evidence the extent to which, if any, the property is subject to forfeiture. (m) Subsequent to the commissioner carrying his burden of proof pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, an interest in property belonging to a third party shall not be forfeited to the extent the third party establishes he has a perfected lien in the property, proves by a preponderance of evidence that he has a perfected priority interest in the property or that he is an innocent owner. For purposes of this subsection: (i) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the violation of this act took place, \"innocent owner\" means a person who held an interest in the property and neither had knowledge of nor consented to the violation; (ii) With respect to a property interest acquired after the violation of this act has taken place, \"inn ocent owner\" means a person who, at the time that person acquired the interest in the property: (A) Was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value of goods or services or a holder of a bona fide security interest; and (B) Did not know and was reasonably without cause to believe the property was subject to forfeiture.

(o) A person's interest in property is not subject to forfeiture to the extent that the forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture. The commissioner shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that a forfeiture is not grossly disproportionate. Proportionality shall be de cided by the court as follows: (i) In determining whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportionate, the court shall consider: (A) The extent to which the property was used or intended to be used in executing the underlying offense; (B) The value of t he property, including both its fair market and subjective value; (C) The actions of the person involved in the activity giving rise to the forfeiture proceedings; (D) The severity of the criminal sanctions associated with the actions of the person; (E) Whether the property constitutes the person's lawful livelihood or means of earning a living; (F) Whether the offense or attempted offense has severe collateral consequences; and (G) Any other factors the court deems necessary and relevant.

The division of criminal investigation shall adopt rules necessary to operate a program to destroy bulk qu antities of contraband controlled substances, which shall include: (A) The photographing and videotaping of the entire bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances to maintain its evidentiary value and to create exhibits for use in legal procee dings; (B) The extraction of ten (10) random samples from the entire bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances for laboratory analysis; (C) A weighing on properly calibrated scales of both the bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances and the representative samples; (D) The additional retention of: (I) Five (5) ounces of organic material if the controlled substance is mar ihuana or a substance of similar organic composition; (II) Five (5) grams of a controlled substance in powdered or crystalline form; (III) Five-tenths (0.5) of a gram of a controlled substance in liquid form; (IV) An amount sufficient for testing by experts shall be made available from the additionally retained sample for the purpose of defending criminal charges arising from the possession, use or sale of the controlled substance. (E) After the testing and retention of samples specified in this par agraph, the commissioner or his designee may order the destruction of the bulk amount of the seized contraband controlled substance in excess of the representative sample and the additional retained samples of the seized contraband controlled substance; (F) Once the representative samples and the additional retained samples of the contraband controlled substance are no longer necessary for evidentiary purposes, any law enforcement officer, upon authorization from the commissioner, may apply to the distric t court with jurisdiction for an order providing for the destruction of the remaining contraband controlled substance. (s) Any controlled substance listed in Schedules I through V that is possessed, transferred, sold or offered for sale in violation of t his act is contraband and shall be seized and summarily forfeited to the state.

(w) Any law enforcement agency of this state may accept, receive, dispose of and expend the property or proc eeds from any property forfeited to the federal government or any state and allocated to the agency by the United States attorney general pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(e) or any law of another state.

This act, W.S. 35 -11-308 through 35 -11-311, may be known an d shall be cited as the \"Wyoming Wetlands Act\". 35-11-309. Legislative policy and intent. (a) The legislature declares that all water, including collections of still water and waters associated with wetlands within the borders of this state are propert y of the state. The legislature further declares that water is one of Wyoming's most important natural resources, and the protection, development and management of Wyoming's water resources is essential for the long-term public health, safety, general welf are and economic security of Wyoming and its citizens. (b) The legislature finds that agriculture, energy development, mining, highway construction and timbering are important industries in this state and that industrial concerns must be accommodated in the protection of wetlands. Wetlands can have an impact on industry practices. Even though property taxes are generally paid on such lands, wetlands p rovide limited economic return to the landowner. Wetland policies can obstruct water development projects and water management projects for private industry as well as public entities and can affect other developments. (c) The legislature finds that wet lands are considered important for a variety of reasons. Wetlands provide the habitat base for the production and maintenance of waterfowl and are sometimes critical to the survival of endangered plants and animals. Wetlands also serve to moderate water fl ow and have value as natural flood control mechanisms, can aid in water purification by trapping, filtering and storing sediment and other pollutants and by recycling nutrients, and can serve as groundwater recharge and discharge areas. Wetlands also funct ion as nursery areas for numerous aquatic animal species and are habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species, and provide vital habitat for resident wildlife. Wetlands also can provide scientific, aesthetic and recreational benefits. The legislature therefore concludes that wetlands and values associated therewith deserve to be effectively managed, protected and preserved. (d) The legislature recognizes that significant differences exist in Wyoming between naturally occurring wetlands and tho se wetlands that result from human activities. Because portions of Wyoming are arid or semiarid, water was diverted from streams and rivers for irrigating cropland, resulting in the creation of wetlands. These wetlands have partially compensated for wetl ands losses. Additionally, road and highway construction, petroleum industry operations and other human activities have created wetlands where none previously existed. While these man -made wetlands are equally as important as naturally occurring wetlands , having the same characteristics and providing the same values and functions, management flexibility is required to acknowledge their different origins and to protect the property rights of landowners and water right holders. (e) In view of the legislat ive findings and conclusions of the importance of wetlands, water development and management, and industry in Wyoming it is hereby declared to be the wetlands policy of this state that water management and development and wetland preservation activities sh ould be balanced to protect and accommodate private property, industry, water and wetland interests and objectives. 35-11-310. Notice to drain waters required; exception. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, after July 1, 1996, no person shall drain water from a naturally occurring or man -made wetland, or any series thereof, which has an area comprising five (5) acres or more, without first notifying the department that the water which will be drained from the wetland, or any series thereof, will not flood or adversely affect downstream lands. Notification shall include the size and location of the wetland, and whether the wetland is natural or man -made. (b) Subsections (a) and (c) of this section do not apply to disturbances of w etlands resulting from mining operations conducted pursuant to mining permits issued by the department of environmental quality. (c) Any person draining, or causing to be drained, water of a naturally occurring wetland, or any series thereof, which has an area comprising five (5) acres or more, without first notifying the department as required by subsection (a) of this section, shall not be eligible to participate in the mitigation credit banking system as provided by W.S. 35 -11-311. Failure to notify th e department pursuant to this section does not constitute a violation for purposes of W.S. 35 -11-901. 35-11-311. Mitigation; guidelines. (a) The department, after consultation with the Wyoming department of agriculture, state engineer, game and fish department, Wyoming water development commission and the department of transportation, shall adopt guidelines for evaluating ecological functi on and values and for establishing and administering a mitigation credit banking system for compensatory mitigation. The guidelines shall, at a minimum, provide for: (i) Criteria under which mitigation credits may be earned, with credit to be recognized for man-made wetlands created after July 1, 1991; (ii) Geographical and other appropriate limitations for the application of mitigation bank credits; (iii) Criteria for the use, banking or sale of banked credits; (iv) The approval by the department for the earning, using, banking, transfer or selling of mitigation bank credits; and (v) Requirements for the maintenance and submission by the department of records concerning ecological function and wetland value losses, and credit and debit accounts for each mitigation bank. 35-11-312. Fees. (a) The department shall implement a surface water point source discharge permit fee system for each permit issued pursuant to W.S. 35 -11-302(a)(v). The department shall assess an annual permit fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each Wyoming pollution discharge elimination system permit and for each permit authorization held by any person under W.S. 35 -11- 301. All payment of permit fees shall be received prior to processing and issuance of the pe rmit. Permit fees shall not be prorated and are nonrefundable upon permit modification, termination or expiration. The department shall prepare a biennium report on the fee system for review by the joint minerals, business and economic development interim committee by October 31 of the year prior to the Wyoming legislative budget session. (b) The fees collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a separate account, and shall be subject to appropriation by the legislature to the department to be used for costs associated with: (i) Surface water quality monitoring and analysis; (ii) Surface water quality modeling analysis and demonstrations; (iii) Other nonoperating costs associated with surface water discharges. (c) The revenue generated by this section shall not be used for operational costs associated with permit processing. 35-11-313. Carbon sequestration; permit requirements. (a) The geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide is prohibited unless authorized by a p ermit issued by the department. (b) The injection of carbon dioxide for purposes of a project for enhanced recovery of oil or other minerals approved by the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapte r. (c) If an oil and gas operator converts to geologic sequestration upon the cessation of oil and gas recovery operations, or injects carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long term storage that results in an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations, then regulation of the geologic sequestration facility and the geologic sequestration site shall be transferred to the department. If the oil and gas operator does not convert to geologic sequestration, the wells shall be plugged and abandoned according to the rules of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. When determining whether an oil and gas recovery operation is injecting carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long term storage that results in an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations, the director shall consider the findings and recommendations of the supervisor of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation com mission. The supervisor shall make his determination following a hearing of the oil and gas conservation commission examiners held under the commission's rules and regulations promulgated under Title 30, Chapter 5 of the Wyoming statutes. The supervisor s hall provide the operator and director with notice of the supervisor's findings and recommendations under this subsection and an opportunity for a public hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. Within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice as provided in this subsection, the operator may request a hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. If both a change in primary purpose to long term storage and an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations are found to have occurred, the commission shall recommend transfer of regulation of the operation to the department. (d) Temporary time limited permits for pilot scale testing of technologies for geologic seq uestration shall be issued by the department based upon current rules and regulations. (e) Permit requirements for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide shall be as defined by department rules. The injector of the carbon dioxide shall apply for any pe rmit required under this section. (f) The administrator of the water quality division of the department of environmental quality, after receiving public comment and after consultation with the state geologist, the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission and the advisory board created under this act, shall recommend to the director rules, regulations and standards for: (i) The creation of subclasses of wells within the existing Underground Injection Control (UIC) program administe red by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect human health, safety and the environment and allow for the permitting of the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide; (ii) Requirements for t he content of applications for geologic sequestration permits.

This subsection shall not apply to collateral bonds issued pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. (c) The amount of any bond to be filed with the administrator prior to commencing any mining s hall be: (i) For an initial bond the amount equal to the estimated cost of reclaiming the affected land disturbed and restoring, as defined in W.S. 35 -11-103(f)(iii), any groundwater disturbed by in situ mining during the first year of operation under ea ch permit. The estimated cost shall be based on the operator's cost estimate submitted with the permit plus the administrator's estimate of the additional cost to the state of bringing in personnel and equipment should the operator fail or the site be aban doned. In no event shall the bond be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), except for limited mining operations authorized and bonded under W.S. 35 -11-401(e) or any noncoal mine the affected land of which, excluding roads, is ten (10) acres or less, in which case the bond amount shall be set by the administrator with approval of the director to cover the cost of reclamation, and in no event less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per acre, for affected land; (ii) For renewal bonds the amount equal to the estimated cost of reclaiming the land to be disturbed during that renewal period, and the estimated cost of completing reclamation of unreleased lands and groundwater disturbed during prior periods of time. The estimated cost shall be based on the operator's cost estimate, which shall include any changes in the actual or estimated cost of reclamation of unreleased affected lands, plus the administrator's estimate of the additional cost to the state of bringing in personnel and equipment should the operator fail or the site be abandoned. In no event shall the bond be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), except for limited mining operations authorized and bonded under W.S. 35-11-401(e) or any noncoal mine the affected land of which, excluding ro ads, is ten (10) acres or less, in which case the bond amount shall be set by the administrator with approval of the director to cover the cost of reclamation, and in no event less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per acre, for affected land. (d) The council may promulgate rules and regulations for a self-bonding program for mining operations under which the administrator may accept the bond of the operator itself without separate surety when the operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process and a history of financial solvency and continuous operation sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond this amount. This subsection shall not become operative until the council has promulgated rules and regulations for the self -bonding program which require that the protection provided by self -bonding shall be consistent with the objectives and purposes of this act. (e) When the reclamation plan for any affected land has been compl eted, the administrator may recommend to the director the release of up to seventy -five percent (75%) of the bond required for that affected land. The remaining portion of the bond shall be not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), and shall be held for a period of at least five (5) years after the date of reduction to assure proper revegetation and restoration of groundwater. The retained portion of the bond may be returned to the operator at an earlier date if a release signed by the surface owner and approved by the administrator and director is obtained. (f) If the area of land or groundwater under permit to be disturbed is increased, then the amount of bond shall be increased to cover the added cost of reclaiming all affected lands or groundwat er. (g) The council may, consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 800.21(c), promulgate rules and regulations that allow the administrator to accept real property posted as a collateral bond without separate surety, provided that the real property is located in this state, the bond provides a perfected first lien security interest in the real property in favor of the department and the protection provided by the bond is consistent with the objectives and purposes of this act. (h) The council shall pro mulgate rules for a voluntary assigned trust program for coal, bentonite, trona and uranium permits or licenses to bond all or a portion of the full cost of reclamation as recommended by the administrator and determined by the director. This subsection sha ll not become operative until the governor has signed rules that the council promulgates for a voluntary assigned trust program that require that the protection provided by voluntary assigned trusts be consistent with the objectives and purposes of this ac t. Any rules promulgated under this subsection shall be in accordance with the following: (i) Participation in an assigned trust program shall be voluntary on the part of an operator. An operator seeking to participate in a voluntary assigned trust as pa rt of the operator's bonding option shall elect to create an assigned trust as required by rules promulgated by the council; (ii) The amount necessary for an operator to fully fund the voluntary assigned trust shall be recommended by the administrator an d determined by the director in accordance with the provisions of this article for each operator's permit or license; (iii) For each payment plan for a voluntary assigned trust: (A) The department shall provide the state treasurer with a copy of the director's annual bond letter that discloses the reclamation obligation and the estimated mine life and duration of reclamation for each individual voluntary assigned trust; (B) Participants in the assigned trust shall provide annual payments of not less than one percent (1%) of the total annual reclamation bond obligation at any time until the assigned trust is fully funded and sufficient to cover the cost of the reclamation obligat ion as provided in W.S. 35 -11-417(c); (C) Participants in the assigned trust shall provide other acceptable bonding instruments authorized by this act to cover the remaining full cost of reclamation.

The program shall be administered by the solid and hazardous waste division of the department of environmental qu ality with the input of the waste and water advisory board as provided in W.S. 35-11-528 through 35 -11-531. (b) Grants and loans shall be made from the municipal solid waste facilities cease and transfer accounts for all cease and transfer activities as provided in this section and by rule and regulation of the board. Grants and loans shall be made for: (i) Capping of a closed landfill; (ii) Other closure related expenses including engineering, geological and other professional services; (iii) Construction or acquisition of appropriate solid waste transfer facilities and equipment, including acquisition of real property. (c) Total costs of cease and transfer activities for a municipal solid waste facility shall be determined by the department in consultation with the local municipal solid waste facility operator. Grants shall be awarded in an amount determined by the state loan and investment board after consultation with the department and pursuant to the criteria contained in subsecti on (d) of this section. A municipal solid waste facility which is ceasing operations shall be eligible to receive loans for the costs of cease and transfer activities not funded by a grant pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. (d) Except as provid ed in subsection (h) of this section, grants and loans for cease and transfer activities shall be awarded in an amount determined by the state loan and investment board not to exceed seventy -five percent (75%) of the total cost of all cease and transfer ac tivities of the municipal solid waste facility. The state loan and investment board shall base its determination of the percentage of grants and loans awarded for cease and transfer projects under the program on an equitable distribution of available funds among eligible municipal solid waste landfills and rules and regulations adopted pursuant to W.S. 35 -11-530. To be eligible for funding under the program the following criteria shall be met: (i) The local operator enters into a written agreement with th e department to meet all regulatory obligations under the program; (ii) The local operator implements and revises the community's solid waste management plan as necessary to comply with all regulatory obligations; (iii) The local operator ceases dispos al of all municipal solid waste streams at the closed municipal solid waste facility; (iv) The local operator conforms to the requirements of W.S. 35 -11-532; (v) The local operator: (A) Ceases disposal into units and facilities regulated under this a rticle which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to performance based design standards; or (B) Obtains department approval, that shall include a time period determined appropriate by the department for operation, to: (I) Transfer and dispose municipal solid waste into permitted units and facilities regulated by the department which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to performance based design standards, for the purpose of closing the facility that is t ransferring municipal solid waste; and (II) Increase the rate at which municipal solid waste is accepted for disposal into permitted units and facilities regulated by the department which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to pe rformance based design standards, for the purpose of promoting the early closure of the receiving facility or facilities. If the department grants approval under this subparagraph the receiving facility shall not be allowed to enlarge or extend the life of its facility except in furtherance of becoming a facility with an engineered containment system or conforming to performance based design standards. (e) Loans may be made under the program at zero interest rate, up to an annual interest rate equal to t he average prime interest rate as determined in accordance with this subsection. Loans provided under the program shall be adequately collateralized as determined by the state loan and investment board. Principal and interest payments shall be deposited in the budget reserve account. The state loan and investment board shall establish interest rates to be charged for loans under the program, but the interest rate shall not exceed an annual interest rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy -five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate shall be adj usted on January 1 of each year. Interest rates shall be established in recognition of the repayment abilities and needs of the local municipal solid waste facility operator eligible for loans under the program. The state loan and investment board shall establish loan amortization schedules, terms and conditions for each loan approved based on an applicant's need, financial condition of the landfill operator or the entity responsible for solid waste funding, the projected life of the transfer facility and the ability of that entity to repay the loan in a timely manner.

ARTICLE 6 - VARIANCES 35-11-601. Application s; authority to grant; hearing; limitations; renewals; judicial review; emergencies. (a) Any person who owns or is in control of any real or personal property, any plant, building, structure, process or equipment may apply to the administrator of the app ropriate division for a variance from any rule, regulation, standard or permit promulgated under this act. A variance may be granted upon notice and hearing. The administrator shall give public notice of the request for a variance in the county in which su ch real or personal property, plant, building, structure, process or equipment is in existence for which the variance is sought. The notice shall designate who has applied for the variance and the nature of the variance requested and the time and place of hearing and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in said county once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing. The cost of publication shall be paid by the person applying for the variance. The administrato r of the division shall promptly investigate the request, consider the views of the persons who may be affected by the grant of the variance, and all facts bearing on the request, and make a decision with the approval of the director within sixty (60) days from the date the hearing for a variance is held. (b) If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the pollution, or mining operation involved, it sha ll continue in effect only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the director may prescribe. (c) If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a perio d not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the director is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and sh all be conditioned on adherence to such timetable. (d) A variance may be granted by the council from standards established by the council for sulfur oxide emissions, if the council determines that the state of the technology for removal of sulfur oxides from the stack gasses is insufficiently advanced to achieve the objective level without causing undue economic hardship on the owner of the facility or the consumer of the product produced by the facility or if the council determines that the developing technology offers promise that superior equipment migh t, in the near future, be available which would render presently available equipment obsolete and that the best interests of the state would be served by the issuance of the variance. In considering such a variance, the council must consider the health and well being of the citizens in the vicinity of the facility and the effect upon livestock and agricultural production in the area. In no event shall the variance permit emissions less stringent than existing federal standards covering the emission of sulfu r oxides. Each application for a variance will be issued on a case by case basis considering the state of the technology at the time of each application. (e) If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, it shall be for not more than one (1) year. (f) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint by an aggrieved party is made to the director on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted, unless following public hearing on the complaint on due notice, the council finds that ren ewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the variance. (g) Any variance or renewal thereof granted by the director pursuant to th is section shall become final unless within thirty (30) days after date of notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section an aggrieved party as defined by this act in writing may request a hearing before the council. Upon the filing of such a request for a hearing, the variance shall be stayed pending the council's final determination thereon. (h) If, after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that a variance is required, it shall affirm or modify the order previously issued by the director or issue an appropriate order for variance as it deems necessary. If, after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that there is no need for a variance, it shall rescind the issuance of a variance. (j) In connection with any hearing held pursuant to this section, the council has the power and upon application by any aggrieved party, it has the duty to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of evidence on behalf of all parties. (k) Any aggrieved party adv ersely affected by a variance or renewal of same or the denial of same may obtain judicial review thereof in the manner prescribed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. (m) Failure to comply with the conditions imposed by any variance shall be cau se for modification or termination of the variance by the director. (n) Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of W.S. 35-11-115 to any person or property. (o) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit an application for a water variance. The application for water permits must be made solely under the provisions of W.S. 35-11-302. (p) Nothing in this act or r egulations under this act shall be construed to permit an application for a variance which would result in less stringent land use or environmental controls or regulations of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than authorized by P.L. 95 -87, as that law is worded on August 3, 1977, or the federal regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. (q) In order to encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices or to allow post -mining land use for industrial, commercial, residential or public use ( including recreational facilities), the director, with approval by the secretary of the interior, may authorize departures in individual cases on an experimental basis from the environmental protection performance standards promulgated by the council under this act. Such departures may be authorized if: (i) The experimental practices are potentially more or at least as environmentally protective, during and after mining operations, as those required by promulgated standards; (ii) The mining operations approved for particular land-use or other purposes are not larger or more numerous than necessary to determine the effectiveness and economic feasibility of the experimental practices; and (iii) The experimental practices do not reduce the protection afforded public health and safety below that provided by promulgated standards. (r) The secretary of interior, acting through the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement, shall assist the state in the development of a state progra m for surface coal mining and reclamation operations which meet the requirements of this act and P.L. 95 -87, and at the same time, reflect local requirements and local environmental and agricultural conditions.

(b) For surface coal mining operations, in the instance of a written complaint by any person which provides a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of article 4 of this act, or of any rule, regulation, standard, order, license, variance or permit issued thereunder, exists, the investigation shall include a prompt inspection. In such event the director shall notify the person when the inspection is proposed to be carried out and the person shall be allowed to accompany the inspector during the inspection, subject to reasonable c ontrol by the inspector. The operator shall have a duty to exercise reasonable care for the person's safety only if his presence is known. However, this duty shall not include the duty to inspect the premises to discover dangers which are unknown to the operator, nor giving warning or protection against conditions which are known or should be obvious to the person. The operator or his designee shall be allowed to be present for any such inspection. (c) For other than those violations specified under subsection (b) of this section, if, as a result of the investigation, it appears that a violation exists, the administrator of the proper division may, by conference, conciliation and persuasion, endeavor promptly to eliminate the source or cause of the viol ation: (i) In case of failure to correct or remedy an alleged violation, the director shall cause to be issued and served upon the person alleged to be responsible for any such violation a written notice which shall specify the provision of this act, rul e, regulation, standard, permit, license, or variance alleged to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof, and may require the person so complained against to cease and desist from the violation within the time the director may d etermine; (ii) Any order is final unless, not later than ten (10) days after the date the notice is served, the person or persons named therein request, in writing, a hearing before the council. Upon the filing of a request the order complained of shall be stayed pending the council's final determination thereon; (iii) If after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that a violation has occurred, it shall affirm or modify such order previously issued, or issue an appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement or control of the violation involved or for the taking of other corrective action. If, after a hearing on an order contained in a notice, the council finds that no violation has occurred, it shall rescind the order. Any order issued as part of a notice or after hearing may prescribe the date or dates by which the violation shall cease and may prescribe timetables for action. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as preventing any person from applyin g for a variance as provided in W.S. 35 -11-601; (iv) At any hearing before the council, it may designate a person to be a referee and may authorize the referee to receive evidence, administer oaths, examine witnesses and issue subpoenas requiring the tes timony of witnesses and the production of evidence and to make reports and recommendations with respect thereto. Any final determination based on the evidence received by any referee shall be made solely by the council. (d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to in any way limit or contravene any other remedy available under this act, nor shall this section be interpreted as a condition precedent to any other enforcement action under this act. ARTICLE 8 - PERMITS 35-11-801. Issuance of permit s and licenses. (a) When the department has, by rule or regulation, required a permit to be obtained it is the duty of the director to issue such permits upon proof by the applicant that the procedures of this act and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder have been complied with. In granting permits, the director may impose such conditions as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this act which are not inconsistent with the existing rules, regulations and standards. An administ rator shall not issue permits and may issue a license under this act only as specifically authorized in this act. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this act the director shall take final action on any application for permit or extension thereof within sixty (60) days after receipt of same unless public notice or hearing is required by state or federal statute. (c) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, a permit to construct is required before construction or modification of any industri al facility capable of causing or increasing air or water pollution in excess of standards established by the department is commenced. (d) General permits shall be issued solely in accordance with procedures set forth by regulation adopted by the council . Procedures for the issuances of general permits shall include public notice and an opportunity for comment. All department authorizations to use general permits under this section shall be available for public comment for thirty (30) days. Any aggrieve d party may appeal the authorization as provided in this act. (e) Except for sources required to have a permit before construction or modification under the applicable requirements of W.S. 35 -11-203 and sources specified by the director, if an applicant for an air quality permit for an oil or gas exploration or production well, with its associated equipment, has submitted a timely and complete application for a permit to construct or modify within ninety (90) days of the first date of production of the oi l and gas operation, the applicant's failure to have a permit shall not be a violation of this section. An applicant complies with this section if the applicant demonstrates to the administrator of the air quality division that the oil and gas exploration or production activity qualifies as a nonmajor source. The application shall contain, at a minimum, a demonstration that the applicant will apply the best available control technology to the oil and gas production and exploration activity. (f) As used i n subsection (e) of this section, \"first date of production\" means the date permanent production equipment is in place and product is consistently flowing to sales lines, gathering lines or storage tanks. Production occurring during well completion activit ies which is routed to temporary production equipment is considered to occur prior to the first date of production. If extended periods of time pass between zone completions but production from initially completed zones is consistently flowing to permanent production equipment, the first date of production is the date when production from the initial zones began consistently flowing to the permanent production equipment, even though more zones will be completed later. 35-11-802. Refusal to grant permits; applicant's rights. If the director refuses to grant any permit under this act, the applicant may petition for a hearing before the council to contest the decision. The council shall give a public notice of such hearing. At such hearing, the director and appropriate administrator shall appear as respondent and the rules of practice and procedure adopted by the council pursuant to this act and the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall apply.

If a federally delegated program requires the imposition of a penalty for a violation, the voluntary disclo sure of the violation shall to the extent allowed under federal law or regulation, be considered a mitigating factor in determining the penalty amount. (b) Reporting a violation is mandatory if required by this act, any departmental rule or regulation, f ederal law or regulation, local ordinance or resolution, any order of the council or by any court and is therefore not voluntary under this section.

The fee collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the corrective action account. The department shall notify all the owners and operators who are on record at the department who have removed or properly a bandoned a tank of the provisions of this subsection. (f) If, after due diligence, no owner or operator can be found, a contaminated site shall be placed on the priority list in appropriate rank with other sites. If an owner or operator of a site which is not in compliance and the owner or operator refuses to comply with subsection (d) of this section is discovered, that site shall be considered as ineligible for use of corrective action account monies and shall be treated as defined in subsection (g) of this section. (g) The department may, by an action brought by the attorney general against an owner or operator, recover reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the department in taking a corrective action. These recoverable expenses include but are not limited to costs of investigating a release, administrative costs and reasonable attorney fees. The department's certification of expenses is prima facie evidence the expenses are reasonable and necessary. Expenses recovered under this section sha ll be deposited in the corrective action account unless otherwise required by state or federal law. The department may sue for recovery of expenses only if: (i) The owner or operator has failed to take the actions required for that site in subsection (d ) of this section; or (ii) The owner or operator had tank insurance for that site at the time of the release. However no such recovery under this subsection may exceed the limits or coverage of the insurance policy in question. (h) The state has a right of subrogation to any insurance policies in existence at the time of the release to the extent of any rights the owne r may have had under that policy. This right of subrogation shall apply regardless of the owner's eligibility to use corrective action account monies under subsection (d) of this section. In implementing this section the department shall: (i) Notify al l known owners and operators, past and present, of sites where contamination from a tank is known to exist and request information relating to any insurance policies they possess or possessed at the time of release that may provide coverage for corrective action or cleanup of the contamination at the site; (ii) Notify all insurance companies which have been identified to the department pursuant to W.S. 35 -11-1419 and may have issued insurance policies that provide coverage for contamination from tanks and request copies of any such policies. In notifying insurance companies the department shall provide the insurance company with the name of all known owners, past and present, and the legal description of the site upon which the tank is or was located. Th e department notification shall require each insurance company to notify the department whenever there is a change in the insurance policy, including cancellation.

(b) Remediation is not voluntary under this article if it is required: (i) By order of the departme nt, council or by any court and entered without the consent of a person; or (ii) By order of the department, council or by any court and entered without the consent of a person who has failed or refused to enter into, or breached the terms of, a prelimin ary remediation agreement, remedy agreement or reopened remedy agreement; or (iii) By administrative or judicial order to which the United States environmental protection agency is a party, which is issued after the effective date of this act, on a site that has been determined not to be eligible under W.S. 35-11-1603. (c) Sites that are not eligible for voluntary remediation are subject to all other applicable requirements of this act, including the provisions of W.S. 35 -11-1613. (d) Nothing her ein shall relieve owners or operators of eligible sites from applicable permit requirements under this act or limit the director's ability to undertake enforcement action relating to a complaint under article 7 of this act and impose a penalty for violatio n of the act under article 9 of this act. (e) Nothing in this article shall limit the director's authority to order any person to abate any condition that poses an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health or the environment, or the director's authority to issue emergency orders under W.S. 35 -11-115. 35-11-1602. Eligibility for voluntary remediation program; sites eligible; sites ineligible. (a) Eligible sites shall include sites which meet the following conditions: (i) Sites, or portions of sites, where releases occurred before the effective date of this article and: (A) The site, or portion of site, where the release occurred was not subject to the permit requirements of this act at the time of the release; or (B) The site is covered by an order of the department, council or by any court and entered with the consent of the person or entity. (ii) Sites, or portions of sites, where releases occurred on or after the effective date of this article and where the owner or operator is impl ementing a pollution prevention plan consistent with rules promulgated under this act; (iii) Waste management or disposal units that have been permitted under this act and the director determines that the release from the permitted unit, if restricted or prohibited by the permit, cannot be remediated in accord with the permit requirements because of technical impracticability. (b) Eligible sites shall not include: (i) A site for which remediation is not voluntary under W.S. 35 -11-1601(b); (ii) A site that is listed on the National Priorities List of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 -9675; (iii) A commercial solid waste management facility, commercial waste incineration or disposal facility subject to W.S. 35-11-514; (iv) Underground and aboveground storage tanks subject to article 14 of this act; (v) Radioactive waste storage facilities subject to article 15 of this act; (vi) Abandoned mine land sites subject to article 12 of this act; or (vii) Any site where a release resulted from continuous or repeated violations of any law, rule, regulation or order under this act. 35-11-1603. Participation in the voluntary remediation program; application; time for determination. To participate in the voluntary remediation program a person must submit an application to the department that identifies the owner and provides a location and description of the site. The application shall also describe the site -specific conditions which the applicant believes satisfy one (1) or more of the eligibility criteria of W.S. 35 -11-1602. No later than forty - five (45) days after receipt of the application, the department shall give written notice to the applicant containing th e department's determination of the site eligibility for participation in the voluntary remediation program. 35-11-1604. Public participation; notice; plan. (a) Following any determination by the department that a site is an eligible site, or following the submission of any application to modify an existing remedy agreement, the owner or operator shall give written notice to all surface owners of record of land which is contiguous to the site, and to all known adjacent surface owners of record of land, and shall publish notice once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice published in a newspaper shall be a display advertisement. The notice to individual landowner s and the notice published in a newspaper shall identify the site, provide a summary of the criterion in W.S. 35 -11-1602 which makes the site eligible for participation in the voluntary remediation program under this article, describe the process for the public to request the development of a public participation plan under subsection (b) of this section, and provide a thirty (30) day period for the public to request that a public participation plan be developed. (b) For any eligible site where there is s ignificant public interest as determined by the director after considering the factors enumerated in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection, the person who has submitted an application for participation, or the owner of the site, shall prepare and implement a public participation plan which shall be approved by the director. In preparing the plan, the applicant or owner shall consult with and consider the public participation needs of interested parties, including but not limited to contiguous surface owners of record and all known adjacent surface owners of record of land, local government, local economic development agencies or groups, and public interest groups. In determining whether there is significant public interest, the director shall consider whether there have been responses to the notice required under subsection (a) of this section requesting the development of a public participation plan by: (i) At least twenty -five (25) individuals; (ii) An organization representing at least twenty - five (25) individuals; or (iii) The governing body of a local government. (c) Any owner or operator of an eligible site which is also subject to permitting or corrective action requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated unde r W.S. 35-11-503(d) shall prepare and implement a public participation plan which complies with those rules and regulations. (d) At a minimum for any eligible site regardless of whether a public participation plan has been required, prior to entering int o a remedy agreement, the owner shall give written notice of the proposed remedy agreement to all surface owners of record of land adjacent to the site, and publish notice once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation i n the county in which the site is located. The notice shall be of a form and content prescribed by the department, and shall summarize the proposed remedy agreement, provide a description of the site, provide for a thirty (30) day public comment period aft er the date of the last publication, and provide an opportunity for an oral hearing. An oral hearing on the proposed remedy agreement shall be held if the department finds sufficient interest. The department may enter into a remedy agreement following the public comment period or any hearing, whichever is later. 35-11-1605. Voluntary remediation standards; site - specific, risk -based standards; considerations in choice of remedy; alternate standards for soil; alternate standards for soil or water; point of compliance; contamination from source not on site; alternate remediation standards for site contaminated from source not on site; supplemental requirements. (a) Consistent with any requirements necessary to retain state primacy in federal progra ms, any remedy proposed by an owner of an eligible site, or considered by the director, shall: (i) Be protective of human health, safety and the environment. A remedy shall be considered to be protective of human health if it reduces risk to human recep tors of acute and chronic toxic exposures to contaminants to levels that do not pose a significant risk to human health. A remedy shall be considered to be protective of the environment if it adequately reduces risk of significant adverse impacts to ecolog ical receptors for which habitats have been identified on or near the site. Remedies may meet this requirement through a combination of monitored natural attenuation, removal, treatment, or engineering or institutional controls. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any site where a remedy is proposed that includes engineering or institutional controls must also have been designated as a use control area in accord with W.S. 35 -11-1609; (ii) Attain standards established by the director under this subsection for air, soil, and water affected by the site, unless the director sets an alternate standard in accord with subsection (c) or (d) of this section. No standard set under this section for a contaminant shall be set at a level or concentrat ion lower than the background level or concentration for that contaminant. A remedy must attain standards or alternate standards by the end of the remediation period set forth in the remedy agreement. A remedy shall be considered to attain standards for ai r, soil and water if it: (A) Meets any applicable media standards established under federal or state law or rule or regulation; or (B) Meets site -specific, risk -based standards developed for the eligible site. Site -specific, risk -based standards shall establish a risk reduction goal for contaminants which are known or suspected carcinogens to ensure that the excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to any exposed individual may not exceed a probability of developing cancer of one in one million (1 in 1,0 00,000) to one in ten thousand (1 in 10,000). The one in one million (1 in 1,000,000) risk level shall be used as the point of departure for determining remediation goals for alternatives when individual contaminant standards are not available, or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposures. Site -specific, risk -based standards must also require that for contaminants which are systemic toxicants, the hazard index must not exceed one (1). The director shall use residential exposure factors, giving consideration to children and the elderly, to establish site - specific, risk -based standards under this subsection for soils and air. The exposure factors to be used by the director to establish site -specific, risk -based standards under this subsection for hazardous substances in groundwater shall assume that groundwater may be used as a drinking water source, provided that no standard set under this subsection for a contaminant shall be s et at a level or concentration lower than the background level or concentration for that contaminant. For nonhazardous substances, the exposure factors to be used by the director shall assume uses consistent with the class of use prior to contamination of the groundwater. (iii) Control any sources of releases so as to reduce or eliminate, to the extent technically practicable, further releases as required to protect human health and the environment. A remedy shall be considered to control sources of releases if it controls the release of contaminants from sources to any media in concentrations that exceed applicable standards set by the director under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, or the soil standards under subsection (c) or (d) of this section; and (iv) Comply with any applicable standard for management of wastes generated as a consequence of the remedy. A remedy shall be considered to comply with applicable standards for management of wastes if all wastes generated as a consequence of implementati on of the remedy are treated, stored or disposed of in compliance with the requirements of this act. (b) The director shall choose a remedy, or combination of remedies, from among those remedies which meet the requirements of subsection (a), (c) or (d) o f this section, as applicable. In choosing a remedy, the director shall consider: (i) The extent to which the remedy will be reliable and effective for the long term. For remedies that include engineering or institutional controls in accord with a use control area designation, the director shall consider the expected life cycle performance of any engineering controls, monitoring systems and institutional controls; (ii) The extent to which the remedy results in a reduction of toxicity, mobility or volum e of contaminants. The director shall consider the degree to which remedies incorporate treatment or removal of contaminants to lower long term risk to human health and the environment; (iii) The short term effectiveness of the remedy. The director sha ll consider the time required for each remedy to attain standards for air, soil and water specified in paragraph (a)(ii) or subsection (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. A remedy involving monitored natural attenuation may be considered whether or not the director has made a determination of technical impracticability under subsection (d) of this section. Monitored natural attenuation shall be deemed effective if there is evidence that natural attenuation is occurring and will be completed within a reasonable time period; (iv) Impacts which may be caused by implementation of the remedy. The director shall consider any adverse impacts which may be caused by a remedy, and shall take into consideration the gravity of any projected impact and the cost and availability of measures to mitigate the impact; (v) The extent and nature of contamination and practicable capabilities of remedial technologies, and whether achieving standards is technically impracticable; (vi) Reasonably anticipated future land uses or use restrictions in a use control area designation; (vii) Consistency of remedies with the nature and complexities of releases of contaminants; and (viii) Cost of the remedy. The director shall consider whether a remedy presents a substantial and disproportionately high cost for implementation and completion. The director shall compare the costs of remedies considering the degree of risk reduction that is afforded by each remedy. Costs considered shall in clude capital, operation and maintenance, engineering and institutional control costs and monitoring costs for the anticipated life of the remedy. (c) The director may establish alternate site -specific, risk-based standards for surface and subsurface soi ls to be employed at a site in lieu of the soil standards in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, for any site that is located within a use control area designated under W.S. 35 -11-1609. A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director u nder this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The alternate standards for such a site shall use the carcinogenic and systemic toxicant risk reduction goals of subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) of this section, except that the exposure assumptions used to calculate the alternate standards under this subsection shall be consistent with the use restrictions contained in the use control area designation. If the director establishes alternate soi l standards under this subsection, the owner or operator must evaluate technologies that can meet the alternate soil standards. Owners or operators of eligible sites that implement remedies which achieve the alternate soil standards set under this subsecti on may be issued a certificate of completion and covenant not to sue pursuant to W.S. 35 -11-1607. The soil standards of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section must be met if the owner or operator applies to remove the use restrictions applicable to the site or to receive a no further action letter under W.S. 35 -11-1608. (d) The director may establish alternate site -specific, risk-based standards for soil or water to be employed at a site in lieu of the soil and water standards in paragraph (a)(ii) of this sect ion if, after evaluation of currently available technology the director determines that it is technically impracticable to meet a standard at a specific site. A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director under this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The technical impracticability determination shall include evaluation of the cost of remedy alternatives, including but not limited to, substantial and disprop ortionately high costs, present worth of construction, operation and maintenance costs, continued operational costs of the remedy selected and costs of any proposed alternative remedy strategies. Whenever the director sets an alternate standard, the direct or shall select a remedy capable of meeting the alternate standard and which is technically practicable, controls any sources of contamination to the extent technically practicable, and controls human and environmental exposures to contaminated air, soil or water. The director may establish alternate standards for soil or water under this subsection only if the owner has or obtains rights to control human or environmental exposures to contaminated media, and consents to impose such controls as are required to protect human health and the environment. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, or W.S. 35 -11-1609 such controls may be imposed by the owner without the site receiving a use control area designation under W.S. 35 -11-1609. The standards of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section must be met if the owner or operator applies to remove the use restrictions applicable to the site or to receive a no further action letter under W.S. 35 -11-1608. (e) When establishing standards under par agraph (a)(ii) or subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the director shall specify one (1) or more points of compliance where standards must be achieved. In specifying a point of compliance, the director shall consider the following factors: (i) Compliance with groundwater standards shall be monitored as close as reasonably practical to the contaminant source or site boundary or boundary of the use control area. The director shall select any groundwater point of compliance based upon the evaluation of th e properties of the aquifer, the proximity of existing and reasonably anticipated points of groundwater withdrawal or discharge to the surface, the location of the contaminant plume relative to the site or use control area boundary, the toxicity of the con taminant, the presence and proximity of multiple contaminant sources, the exposure and likelihood of actual exposure to contaminated groundwater, and the technical practicability of groundwater remediation; (ii) For soils, standards shall be met at locat ions determined to ensure protection of human health and identified environmental receptors, and protection of surface water, groundwater and air resulting from any potential transfer of contaminants from soils to these other media; and (iii) For surface water, standards shall be met at the point where any release enters any surface water of the state consistent with applicable federal and state requirements. If sediments are affected by releases to surface water, a sediment point of compliance may also b e established. (f) Remediation standards for a site that has become contaminated by a release or migration of contamination from a source not located on the site shall be appropriate for any use control area designation applicable to such site, or if des ired by the owner the remediation requirements shall be adequate to restore the site to all uses for which it was suitable prior to the contamination. (g) The department may establish supplemental requirements for owners or operators of lands or faciliti es subject to permitting or corrective action requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated under W.S. 35 -11-503(d) as may be necessary to ensure that such sites are characterized and remediated in a manner which is consistent with , equivalent to, and no less stringent [than] permitting, closure, post - closure and corrective action requirements contained in rules and regulations adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under authority of subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901, et seq. Election by an eligible site owner or operator who is subject to such hazardous waste permitting or corrective action requirements to participate in the voluntary remediation program under thi s article shall not relieve the owner or operator of the duty to comply with all requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated under W.S. 35 -11-503(d). 35-11-1606. Preliminary remediation agreement; contents. (a) The preliminary remediation agreement shall contain the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, which shall include the information and procedures required for completion of an environmental assessment or site characterization that is adequate and appropriate to s upport selection of a permanent or long term protective remedy for the site and adjacent property to meet the standards in W.S. 35 -11-1605, and a work plan, schedule and statement of any criteria the department intends to use to evaluate work plans and rep orts. (b) For any site that is determined by the director to have the potential for significant contamination, be located in an area where human exposures to contaminants are likely, or require evaluation of remedial alternatives as a condition for the state to maintain primacy in any federal program, the director shall require the site characterization plan within the preliminary remediation agreement under this section to include a description of alternative remedial actions to be evaluated and a plan f or the collection of any data and site information needed to evaluate those alternative remedial actions. Not all potential remedies must be evaluated for a site. The director and the owner may enter into a single agreement containing both characterization and alternative remedial action evaluation plans, or may enter into an alternative remedial action evaluation agreement following completion of site characterization. 35-11-1607. Remedy agreement; prerequisite; contents; violation of agreement; changes covenant not to sue; certificate of completion; recording; effect on orders or permits. (a) Except as provided in W.S. 35 -11-1605(d), before an owner and the department may enter into a remedy agreement that includes long -term restrictions on the use of the site, the owner must obtain a use control area designation for the site as set forth in W.S. 35 -11-1609. The use restrictions contained in any use control area designation may be used by the director to establish any al ternate soil standard as provided in W.S. 35-11-1605(c). (b) Any remedy agreement shall contain: (i) A remedial action plan, including the remediation standards and objectives for the site or use control area, the remediation standards and objectives for adjacent property, a description of any engineering or institutional control, a schedule for the required remediation activities, and conditions for the effective and efficient implementation of the remedy agreement. The department shall re quire a suitable bond or other evidence of financial assurance to assure the performance and maintenance of engineering controls and any monitoring activities required in a remedy agreement; and (ii) The reopeners or termination clauses set forth in W.S. 35-11-1610. (c) The remedy and remediation standards for a site that are set forth in a remedy agreement shall be permanent, subject to the reopeners and termination clauses in W.S. 35 -11-1610. (d) Use restrictions, or other terms or conditions set forth in a remedy agreement shall run with the land and be binding upon successors in interest. If a term or condition of any remedy agreement, covenant not to sue, or certificate of completion requires the maintenance of a bond or other evidence of financi al assurance, it shall be the duty of any successor in interest to maintain such bond or financial assurance. (e) A violation of any use restriction, term or condition of a remedy agreement or certificate of completion shall be deemed a violation of this act, and the department may bring any action for such violation against the owner of the site at the time the violation occurs or against the person who violates the use restriction, term or condition of the remedy agreement or certificate of completion. (f) No person shall change any engineering or institutional controls contained in a remedy agreement or certificate of completion without the prior written consent of the department. Before a change may be made, the department shall review the contaminat ion at the site and any new requirements shall be incorporated into a subsequent remedy agreement or certificate of completion. Upon entry into a subsequent remedy agreement or certificate of completion or issuance of a no further action letter, the direc tor shall modify or terminate any prior remedy agreement or certificate of completion. (g) Consistent with the reopeners and termination clauses in W.S. 35 -11-1610, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a covenant not to sue. Any covenant not to sue shall extend to subsequent owners. (h) If the director determines that all remediation requirements for a site have been successfully implemented or satisfied, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a certificate of completion. (j) A person who receives a remedy agreement or certificate of completion under this section shall record a copy in the office of the county clerk with the deed for the site and shall file the copy in t he office of the county clerk no later than ten (10) business days after the date the remedy agreement or certification of completion is signed. (k) No remedy agreement for any site subject to a prior administrative or judicial order or permit which cont ains remedial requirements shall be effective until the order or permit has been modified to incorporate the terms of the remedy agreement. Modifications to orders or permits under this subsection shall be made using the procedures specified in the prior order or permit. Entry into a remedy agreement under this article shall not affect the duty of the site owner or operator to comply with any prior order or permit. Following modification of the order or permit as provided in this subsection, the owner shall comply with the modified order or permit. 35-11-1608. No further action letters; findings; natural attenuation. (a) If the department determines that no further remediation is required on a site, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a no further action letter, subject to reopener or termination as provided in W.S. 35-11-1610. The department may only issue a no further action letter upon a finding by the department that the site does not require engineering or institutional controls or use restrictions to meet the standards specified in W.S. 35-11-1605(a)(ii). (b) When the department has determined that monitored natural attenuation over a reasonable period of time is appropriate and that no exposure to contaminated media is reasonably expected during the period of natural attenuation, the department shall, upo n request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a no further action letter. The no further action letter may require that the current use of the property continue during the period of natural attenuation and also may require that testing be conducte d to confirm that standards are met. 35-11-1609. Use control areas; when establishment required; procedure; contents of petition; notice; failure of governmental entity to act; enforcement; exception. (a) The owner of a site who proposes long -term restrictions on the use of the site shall petition to the appropriate governmental entity or entities for the creation of a use control area to establish long -term restrictions on the use of the site. (b) A use control area may be created or modified only upon the petition of the owner of a site, and notice and public hearing as provided in subsection (d) of this section, and shall include only the site, unless adjacent property owners consent. (c) The petition to establish a use control area shall contain data, information and any remedy options required in a preliminary remediation agreement under W.S. 35 -11-1606. (d) Upon submission of a petition for long term use restrictions, the governmental entity to whom the use area designation petition has been s ubmitted shall cause the owner to give written notice of the petition to all surface owners of record of land contiguous to the site, and to publish notice of the petition and a public hearing once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice shall identify the property, generally describe the petition and proposed use restrictions, direct that comments may be submitted to the governmental entity or entities to whom the petition has been submitted, and provide the date, time and place of a public hearing. The public hearing shall be held no sooner than thirty (30) days after the first publication of the notice. After the public hearing has been held, the governing board , commission or council shall vote upon the creation of the use control area in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and procedures. No use control area shall be created except upon petition of the owner and a majority vote of the appropriate boa rd, commission or council. (e) The governmental entity to whom the use control area petition has been submitted shall approve or deny an owner's petition for a use control area within one hundred eighty (180) days after the petition is received. The owne r and a governmental entity may agree to extend the time period in which the governmental entity is to vote upon the petition. The governmental entity may, on a vote taken within one hundred eighty (180) days after the petition is received, condition its vote approving the petition upon the owner's subsequent filing of the determination by the director that a remedy can be selected that meets the requirements of W.S. 35 -11-1605 and is consistent with owner's petition. (f) The restrictions in a use control area are enforceable by the issuing governmental entity by injunction, mandamus or abatement, in addition to any other remedies provided by law. (g) Except as provided in subsection (e), nothing in this section shall contravene or limit the authority of any county, city or town to regulate and control the property under their jurisdiction. (h) The department shall not have the authority to require a governmental entity to adopt any zoning regulation or restriction applicable to a site as part of a reme diation or response action or a remedy agreement. (j) If the department has issued a no further action letter under W.S. 35 -11-1608, then no use control area designation shall be required. 35-11-1610. Reopening or termination of remedy agreements, covenants not to sue, certificates of completion or no further action determinations; conditions; recording. (a) The department may reopen a remedy agreement, covenant not to sue or certificate of completion at any time if: (i) The current owner fails subs tantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the remedy agreement, covenant not to sue or certificate of completion; (ii) An imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment is discovered; (iii) Contamination is discovered that was present on the site but was not known to the owner or the department on the date of the remedy agreement or when t he department issued a covenant not to sue or certificate of completion; or (iv) The remedy fails to meet the remediation objectives that are contained in the remedy agreement or certificate of completion. (b) The department may reopen a no further act ion determination at any time if: (i) An imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment is discovered; or (ii) The department determines that the monitored natural attenuation remedy under W.S. 35 -11-1608(b) is not effective i n meeting the standards for a no further action letter under this section. (c) The department may terminate a remedy agreement, covenant not to sue, certificate of completion or no further action letter if it is discovered that any of these instruments were based on fraud, material misrepresentation or failure to disclose material information, or if an owner's willful violation of any use restriction results in harmful exposures of any toxic contaminant to any user or occupant of the site. (d) If a reme dy agreement, covenant not to sue, certificate of completion or no further action letter is reopened or terminated, the department shall record a notice of such action in the office of the county clerk with the deed for the site and shall file the notice i n the office of the county clerk no later than ten (10) business days after the date of the remedy agreement, covenant not to sue, certificate of completion or no further action letter is reopened or terminated. 35-11-1611. Disputes; appeal. If a person and the department are unable after good faith efforts to resolve a dispute arising under this article pursuant to the provisions of an agreement, the person may appeal the department's decision to the council. 35-11-1612. Fees; notice; appeal. The department shall implement a fee system and schedule of fees which are applicable to the preliminary remediation agreements, remedy agreements, certificates of completion and no further action letters authorized under this article. Fees shall cover all reaso nable direct and indirect costs of the department's participation in any activity authorized by this article. The department shall give written notice of the amount of the fee assessment. The owner of the eligible site may appeal the assessment to the co uncil within forty -five (45) days of receipt. 35-11-1613. Remediation requirements for nonvoluntary sites. (a) The remediation requirements for sites that do not participate in the voluntary remediation program in W.S. 35-11-1601 through 35 -11-1612 may include, in the discretion of the director requirements which: (i) Return contaminated soil and water to background contaminant levels; (ii) Return contaminated soil to contaminant levels that are safe for any potential future use of the site; (iii) Return contaminated groundwater to contaminant levels that ensure that the class of use of groundwater prior to the release is restored, or if not technically practicable, employs the best available groundwater remediation technology. No liability release shall be provided to the owner until the owner demonstrates that groundwater standards have been met; (iv) Remove all continuing sources of soil or water contamination; and (v) Eliminate to the extent practical any continuing risk to any ecological receptor present at or near the site. ARTICLE 17 - ORPHAN SITE REMEDIATION 35-11-1701. Orphan site remediation; account created. (a) There is created an orphan site remediation account. The director may expend funds contained within the account for the purpose of remediation of orphan sites and the performance of any other activity as defined in this article. (b) As used in this section, orphan sites means: (i) Sites where the department determines that there is no viable party that is responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination present at the site; and (ii) Sites where the department has issued a no further a ction letter, and where there is a subsequent discovery of contamination which was present at the site when the no further action letter was issued but: (A) Was not known to the site owner or the department at the time the no further action letter was is sued, provided that a comprehensive and complete site characterization was conducted by the owner; (B) Is not the result of activities conducted on the site after the no further action letter was issued; and (C) Does not constitute an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health or the environment which is being addressed by the holder of the no further action letter pursuant to a reopening of the no further action letter under W.S. 35 -11-1610(b). (iii) Spill sites, where the department determ ines that the person responsible for the spill cannot be identified, or where the department must take prompt action to prevent hazards to human health or the environment at a site where a responsible party fails to act promptly. (c) The department may expend funds from this account to conduct site evaluations and testing, evaluate remedial measures, select remediation requirements, and construct, install, maintain and operate systems to remedy contamination in accordance with a remediatio n work plan prescribed by the director for the orphan site. (d) The department may also expend funds from this account to pay for the orphan share of any removal or remedial action taken pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Control And L iability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq.), provided that: (i) The department has participated in negotiations for, and concurs with, the orphan share allocation amount for the action; and (ii) Each responsible party to an action has agreed not to seek cos t recovery from less than de minimus contributors in exchange for the state assumption of the orphan share cost. (e) Revenue to the account shall include such monies which may be deposited in the account for use in remediation of orphan sites. The liabil ity of the state to fulfill the requirements of this section is limited to the amount of funds available in the account.

The legislature intends by provisions of this chapter, that approval of cooperative arrangements among health care providers, purchasers and third party payors be accompanied by appropriate conditions and ongoing supervision and regulation of the operations of the cooperative arrangements, in order to protect against any abuses and to effectively except the actions of approved and regulated cooperative arrangements from state and federal antitrust liability. 35-24-102.

Criteria for approving application; factors enumerated. (a) The director shall not approve an application unless he determines the arrangement is more likely to result in a better overall promotion of the quality of health care, access to health care, a lower cost for health care and the increased availability of a comprehensive health care system in the state, than would otherwise occur under existing market conditions or conditions likely to devel op without an exemption from state and federal antitrust law. If a proposed arrangement appears likely to improve certain criteria at the expense of other criteria, the director shall not approve the application unless he determines improvements outweigh the negative impacts and the proposed arrangement, taken as a whole, is likely to substantially further the purposes of this chapter. (b) In making a determination about cost, access, quality and the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state, the director may to the extent applicable, require the applicant to demonstrate or provide information for purposes of considering: (i) If the proposal includes provisions for cost containment; (ii) Market structure, including: (A) Actual and potential sellers and buyers or providers and purchasers; (B) Actual and potential consumers; (C) Geographic market area; and (D) Entry conditions. (iii) Current market conditions; (iv) The historical behavior of the market; (v) Performance of other similar arrangements; (vi) If the proposal unnecessarily restrains competition or restrains competition in ways not reasonably related to the purposes of this chapter; and (vii) The financial condition of the applicant. (c) The analysis of cost by the director shall consider the individual consumer of health care and if a proposed arrangement will result in cost -efficiencies in the services provided by the applicant. Cost -efficiencies to be realized by providers, group purchasers or other participants in the health care system also are relevant and shall be considered to the extent any efficiencies are likely to directly or indirectly benefit the consumer. If an application is sub mitted by providers primarily paid by third party payors or persons unaffiliated with the applicant, it is sufficient for the applicant to show that cost savings are likely to be passed on to the unaffiliated third party payors or persons and the applicant s shall not be required to show that third party payors with whom the applicants are not affiliated will pass on cost savings to individuals receiving coverage through the third party payors. To the extent relevant and ascertainable, cost analysis may als o include the impact on overall employer premiums for health insurance. In making determinations as to costs, the director shall determine the extent to which: (i) The cost savings likely to result to the applicant; (ii) The extent to which cost saving s are likely to be passed on to the consumer and in what form; (iii) The extent to which overall employer premium costs for health insurance will be decreased; (iv) The extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to result in cost shifting by the applicant onto other payors or purchasers of other products or services; (v) The extent to which any cost shifting by the applicant is likely to be followed by other persons in the market; (vi) The extent to which the proposed arrangement reduces overall systemic cost shifting; (vii) The current and anticipated supply and demand for any products or services at issue; (viii) The representations and guarante es of the applicant and their enforceability; (ix) Effectiveness of regulation by the director; (x) Inferences to be drawn from market structure; (xi) The cost of regulation, both for the state and for the applicant; and (xii) Any other factors showing that the proposed arrangement is or is not likely to reduce costs. (d) In making determinations as to access, the director shall determine the extent to which the: (i) Utilization of needed health care services or products by the intend ed targeted population is likely to increase or decrease. When a proposed arrangement is likely to increase access in one (1) geographic area by lowering prices or otherwise expanding supply, but limits access in another geographic area by removing servic e capabilities from that second area, the director shall require the applicant to articulate the criteria employed to balance these effects; (ii) Proposed arrangement is likely to make available a new and needed service or product to a certain geographic area; (iii) Proposed arrangement is likely to otherwise make health care services or products more financially or geographically available to consumers, particularly persons in historically underserved populations including indigent persons and unserved geographic areas; and (iv) Proposed arrangement is likely to result in a wide distribution of appropriate health care services throughout the state. (e) If the director determines that the proposed arrangement is likely to increase access and bases th at determination on a projected increase in utilization, the director shall require the applicant to demonstrate that the increased utilization does not result in overutilization. (f) In making determinations as to quality, the director shall determine t he extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to: (i) Decrease morbidity and mortality; (ii) Result in faster convalescence; (iii) Result in fewer hospital days; (iv) Permit providers to attain needed experience or frequency of treatment li kely to lead to better outcomes; (v) Result in more effective or efficient provider credentialing and licensing; (vi) Result in increased or more effective use of clinical practice guidelines, quality assurance measures such as continued quality improvement and other outcome measurements; (vii) Increase patient satisfaction; and (viii) Have any other features li kely to improve or reduce the quality of health care. (g) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, in evaluating if a proposed arrangement improves or reduces the quality of health care, the director shall preserve the confidentiality of quality m anagement functions involving health care facilities and peer review activities involving professional standard review organizations as set forth in W.S. 35-2-910 and 35 -17-101 through 35 -17-106. (h) In making determinations as to whether a proposed arrangement contributes to the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state, the director shall determine the extent to which the arrangement is likely to: (i) Promote the development of and access to a wide variety of health care services an d specialties in the state; (ii) Minimize cost -shifting in which more lucrative patient populations and specialties are served at the expense of other patients and specialties, resulting in fewer services available in the state; and (iii) Promote acces s to appropriate health care services in locations throughout the state. 35-24-112. Final decision; conditions for approval; findings; ongoing supervision and reporting; renewal fees. (a) The director shall issue a written decision approving or disappr oving the application. (b) The director may condition approval on a modification of all or part of the proposed arrangement to eliminate any restriction on competition that is not reasonably related to the goals of reducing cost or improving access or qu ality. The director may also establish conditions for approval that are reasonably necessary to protect against abuses of private economic power and to ensure that the arrangement is appropriately supervised and regulated by the state. (c) The decision by the director approving or disapproving an application shall include specific findings of fact concerning cost, access and quality criteria and shall identify one (1) or more of these criteria as the basis for the decision. (d) The decision to approve an application shall require periodic submission of specific data by the applicant relating to cost, access and quality and to the extent feasible, the applicant shall identify objective standards of cost, access and quality by which the success of the arr angement will be measured. If the director determines that the scope of a particular proposed arrangement is such that the arrangement is certain to have neither a positive or negative impact on any one (1) of the criteria, the director may not require th e submission of data or establish an objective standard relating to that criteria. An applicant shall submit a renewal fee together with information required under this subsection, in an amount determined by the department subject to limitations imposed under W.S. 35 -24-104(d). Revenues from fees collected shall be deposited into the account established under W.S. 35 -24-104(d). 35-24-113. Judicial review. After the director has rendered a decision under W.S. 35 -24-112 and in accordance with W.S. 16 -3-114, the applicant or any other aggrieved party may request judicial review of the director's decision by filing a petition for review within thirty (30) days in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. A determination under W.S. 35 -24-107(a) shall not be raised as an issue on appeal. 35-24-114. Ongoing supervision following application approval; procedures; solicitation of public comment on arrangement impacts. (a) The director shall appropriately supervise, monitor and regulate approv ed arrangements consistent with subsection (b) of this section. (b) The decision approving the application shall specify a time schedule for the submission of data by the applicant, which shall be at least once a year and shall identify the data required to be submitted. The director may at any time require the submission of additional data or alter the time schedule. Upon review of the data submitted, the director shall notify the applicant on compliance of the arrangement with the initial decision or su bsequent orders. If the arrangement is not in compliance, the director shall identify those respects in which the arrangement does not conform to the decision. (c) An applicant receiving notification that an arrangement is not in compliance may respond with additional data within thirty (30) days. The response may include a proposal and time schedule by which the applicant will bring the arrangement into compliance with the initial decision or subsequent orders. If the arrangement is not in compliance and the director and the applicant cannot agree to the terms of bringing the arrangement into compliance, the matter shall be set for hearing. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in the manner prescribed under W.S. 35 -24-110. The hearing officer shall issue a written recommendation to the director who shall issue a final decision within thirty (30) days following issuance of the recommendation. A copy of the recommendation and final decision shall be provided to all parties to the contested case hearing. A final decision by the director is subject to judicial review in accordance with W.S. 16 -3-114. (d) The director shall publish notice two (2) years after the date the initial application is approved and at two (2) year intervals thereafter , soliciting comments from the public concerning the impact the arrangement has had on cost, access and quality. The director may request additional oral or written information from the applicant or from any other source. 35-24-115. Revocation of approv al; conditions; notice; public comment; hearing; alternatives specified; liability of applicant. (a) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the director shall revoke his initial approval of an application if the arrangement: (i) Is not i n substantial compliance with the terms of the application; (ii) Is not in substantial compliance with the conditions of approval; (iii) Has not and is not likely to substantially achieve improvements in cost, access or quality or the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state as identified in the initial decision as the basis for approval of the arrangement; or (iv) Is not promoting reductions in cost and improvements in access and quality to the extent competition would do so due t o changing conditions in the marketplace. Revocation under this paragraph shall be identified in writing by the director together with reasons therefor. (b) The director shall initiate a proceeding to revoke approval by providing written notice to the a pplicant describing in detail the basis for the proposed revocation.

(d) In deciding whether to revoke an approval, the director shall consider the hardship the revocation may impose on the applicant and any potential disruption of the market as a whole. The director shall also consider based upon a demonstration by the ap plicant, if the arrangement can be modified, restructured or regulated in a manner to remedy the problem upon which the revocation proceeding is based. Before approving an alternative to revocation that involves modifying or restructuring an arrangement, t he director shall publish notice stating that any person may comment on the proposed modification or restructuring within twenty (20) days after publication of the notice.
