Since that time, we have made historic strides: tobacco rates for youth have reached an all-time low and life expectancy for Chicagoans has reached an all-time high. These are accomplishments to celebrate. But at the same time, our work is not yet done. Too many Chicagoans continue to be affected by preventable diseases, too many continue to be burdened by and endure the effects of violence and too many do not have access to resources and opportunities that allow them to lead healthy lives. Data show that health inequities are wide and we must do more to eliminate the unjust differences in health that exist among Chicago communities and across the lines of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, gender identity and sexual orientation. Healthy Chicago 2.0 is the next step in our ongoing effort to ensure that every resident of Chicago has the opportunity to live a healthy life. Focusing on areas where health disparities remain, this plan provides over 200 actionable strategies to reduce inequities and improve the health and vitality of our residents and our city. By addressing both traditional health issues such as chronic disease and the root causes of poor health such as transportation and housing, Healthy Chicago 2.0 aims to ensure that every child raised in Chicago, regardless of neighborhood and background, has the resources and opportunities to live a healthy life. I invite you to join our more than 130 partner organizations to put this plan into action as we work to make Chicago the healthiest city in the nation. Rahm Emanuel Mayor, City of Chicago HEAL THY CHICAGO 2.0 Dear Partners, Chicago is my home. My parents came to Chicago after being relocated from the west coast during World War II. With the support of community organizations, churches and extended family, they were able to create a safe, stable and supportive environment for my brothers and me. As a result, we have been able to lead healthy and productive lives and my husband and I have been able to do the same for our two children. My vision is for all Chicago residents to have the same opportunities that have allowed my family and me to thrive. As Commissioner for the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), I have the unique opportunity to lead a department that has the responsibility to do just that. CDPH is responsible for maximizing the health and well-being of every Chicago resident, but our department alone can't accomplish that goal. We know that good health depends on numerous factors, including many that are outside of the traditional public health sphere. The availability of economic resources, the conditions of the homes in which we live, our educational opportunities and the degree to which we feel safe and connected in our neighborhoods play critical roles in improving our health. That is why the development of Healthy Chicago 2.0 is an important milestone for Chicago. Healthy Chicago 2.0 is a plan for the entire city. As part of the planning process, we convened representatives from more than 130 organizations across a broad range of sectors to review data and then identify actionable strategies to address our city's most pressing health issues and their root causes. The plan is a result of a collaborative effort. Its implementation, similar to its development, is dependent on partners across the city working together to make the changes necessary to improve health. I am grateful for the businesses, non- profit organizations, philanthropic agencies, faith-based networks, advocacy groups, other government agencies and residents who devoted a great deal of time and energy to create this plan and who have committed resources and human capital to see that the goals in this plan are realized. Achieving health equity will take time, resources and dedication. I look forward to working together to create a Chicago where every resident has the opportunities, resources and information necessary to live a healthy life.

This vision will be achieved when Chicago's public health system, a multi-sector network of organizations such as health care providers, government agencies, social service providers, advocates, academic institutions, businesses and faith-based organizations, works collectively to improve the health of the population.A city with strong communities and collaborative stakeholders, where all residents enjoy equitable access to resources, opportunities and environments that maximize their health and well-being.2INTRODUCTION In September 2014, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), in collaboration with the Partnership for Healthy Chicago, launched a comprehensive community health assessment to collect and analyze health data and, from those findings, identify strategic issues to improve health equity in Chicago. We used the National Association for County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) to conduct this assessment. 2 As part of the community health assessment, nearly 1,000 public health stakeholders and residents participated in reviewing more than ten million data elements to identify health gaps. Public health stakeholders and residents reviewed data and then identified 10 priority action areas. The priority areas include both health outcomes as well as the root causes of health.Action Areas: 1. Expanding Partnerships and Community Engagement 2. Improving Social, Economic and Community Conditions 3. Improving Education 4. Increasing Access to Health Care and Human Services 5. Promoting Behavioral Health 6. Strengthening Child and Adolescent Health 7. Preventing and Controlling Chronic Disease 8. Preventing Infectious Diseases 9. Reducing Violence 10. Utilizing and Maximizing Data and Research After completing the community health assessment, CDPH convened action teams focused on the 10 priority areas. These action teams, each co-chaired by a CDPH staff person and a community partner, engaged over 200 public health stakeholders including community members, non-profit leaders, health care workers, city agency leaders and others. At the beginning of the process, all action team members received training on developing the plan and then spent five months formulating specific goals, objectives and strategies. These actionable strategies form Healthy Chicago 2.0, Chicago's four-year community health improvement plan. Each strategy is focused on closing or eliminating health inequities. PROCESS: ASSESSMENT & ACTION TEAMS The Partnership for Healthy Chicago is a public-private partnership of multi-sector stakeholders, convened by the Chicago Department of Public Health, who are working together to strengthen the public health system.3INTRODUCTION FRAMEWORK This plan is organized into six chapters: 1. Expanding Partnerships and Community Engagement 2. Addressing the Root Causes of Health 3. Improving Access to Health Care and Human Services 4. Improving Health Outcomes 5. Utilizing and Maximizing Data and Research 6. Taking the Next Steps Each chapter includes a brief background with data and maps to help visualize the issue, as well as the goals, objectives and strategies that will guide the implementation of this plan. Objectives of Healthy Chicago 2.0 are to be achieved by 2020. There are 82 objectives in total; 42 focus on making changes citywide and 25 focus specifically on a population subgroup, such as residents living in economic hardship or youth living in areas with low opportunity for healthy development. Other factors examined include a specific race-ethnicity, age, housing status, sexual orientation and/or gender identity group. Included in the 82 objectives are 11 objectives, indicated by , that were identified by stakeholders to address data gaps. Additionally, there are four novel objectives, indicated by , that were determined to be vitally important to the plan despite the fact that baseline and target data do not currently exist for the specific measure. It remains an overall strategy of this plan to explore new ways of reliably and accurately measuring these novel objectives by 2020.Goals: The vision to be achieved within each action area Strategies: Evidence-based/ informed or innovative approaches to achieve the goal Objectives: Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound indicators to measure the success of our strategy implementationA B CD EF G HI J KL MNO PQ RSTU V W XY Z US Census, American Community Survey, 2014 5-Year Estimate835,249 A B CCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted D E U V W X Y ZBelmont-Cragin HermosaAustinHumboldt ParkWest Garfield ParkEast RiverdaleChicagoans were living in HIGH ECONOMIC HARDSHIP in 2014 F G H I J K L MN O P Q R S TLow Medium HighEconomic Hardship Index 835,249 A B CCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted D E U V W X Y ZBelmont-CraginHermosaAustinHumboldt ParkWest Garfield ParkEast Garfield RiverdaleChicagoans were living in HIGH ECONOMIC HARDSHIP in 2014 F G H I J K L MN O P Q R S TLow Medium HighEconomic Hardship Index 4INTRODUCTION The Economic Hardship Index compares social and economic conditions between Chicago communities. The hardship index is a relative composite index of six indicators: (i) crowded housing (percentage occupied by housing units with more than one person per room); (ii) poverty (percentage of persons living below the federal poverty level); (iii) unemployment (percentage of persons over the age of 16 years who are unemployed); (iv) education (percentage of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education; (v) dependency (percentage of the population under 18 or over 64 years of age) and (vi) income (per capita income). The hardship index provides a more complete, multidimensional measure of community socioeconomic conditions than individual measures such as income or employment alone. A community with a high hardship score has worse social and/or economic conditions than a community with a low or medium hardship score.A B C D EF G H IJK L Opportunity Index 48% A B CCOMMUNITY AREAS with lowest child opportunity in Chicago are living in LOW CHILD OPPORTUNITY AREAS 1 in 2 African American and Hispanic children live in low child opportunity areas compared to 1 in 50 white childrenF G HI J K L M N O P Childhood Opportunity IndexVery LowLowModerateHighVery HighChild Opportunity Index 48% A B CCOMMUNITY AREAS with lowest child opportunity in Chicago are living in LOW CHILD OPPORTUNITY AREAS 1 in 2 African American and Hispanic children live in low child opportunity areas compared to 1 in 50 white childrenF G HI J K L M N O P 5INTRODUCTION The Child Opportunity Index measures community characteristics that influence a child's health and development. These features are organized into three overarching domains of opportunity: educational, health and environmental, and social and economic. All of these factors are combined into a relative, composite measure of overall opportunity for children living within a particular community.Components of the Child Opportunity Index Educational Adult educational attainment Student (school) poverty rate Reading proficiency rate Math proficiency rate Early childhood education neighborhood participation patterns High school graduation rate Proximity to high-quality early childhood education centers Proximity to early childhood education centers of any typeHealth & Environmental Retail healthy food index Proximity to toxic waste release sites Volume of nearby toxic release Proximity to parks and open spaces Housing vacancy rates Proximity to health care facilities Social & Economic Neighborhood foreclosure rate Poverty rate Unemployment rate Public assistance rate Proximity to employment6INTRODUCTION7INTRODUCTION OVERARCHING OUTCOMES Healthy Chicago 2.0 outlines 30 goals, 82 objectives and over 200 strategies across 10 action areas. Many strategies are cross cutting, and employ policy, systems and environmental change. If all are implemented in concert, we will achieve even greater success. Through our combined efforts, Healthy Chicago 2.0 will result in a number of overall health and system improvements for Chicago residents, including: 1. Increasing life expectancy 2. Reducing obesity 3. Reducing preventable hospitalizations 4. Reducing discrimination 5. Improving overall health 6. Reducing economic hardship 7. Increasing opportunities for children to live healthy lives 8. Institutionalizing a Health in All Policies approach 9. Becoming a Trauma-Informed City8INTRODUCTION HEAL TH IN ALL POLICIES Healthy Chicago 2.0 was developed and will be implemented by a diverse group of individuals and organizations, as every sector and individual is responsible for improving and maintaining the health of our city. This collaboration is guided by the Health in All Policies approach, which encourages institutions to consider the health impacts of their policy and programming decisions. 3 At its core, Health in All Policies addresses the social determinants of health\u2014the root causes of health outcomes and health inequities\u2014 through five key elements: 1) promoting health and equity, 2) supporting multi-sector collaboration, 3) creating benefits for multiple partners, 4) engaging stakeholders and 5) creating structural or process change. Healthy Chicago 2.0 will formalize a Health in All Policies approach for the City of Chicago government, ensuring every city agency approaches its work using a health equity lens. By collaborating directly with other agencies, we will not only meet the goals outlined in this plan but also lay the foundation for ongoing health improvements across Chicago. When it's better for everyone ... it's better for everyone. \u2014Eleanor Roosevelt\" \"\"Root causes of health [social determinants of health] are life-enhancing resources, such as food supply, housing, economics, social relationships, transportation, education and health care, whose distribution across populations effectively determines length and quality of life. \" 49INTRODUCTION TRAUMA-INFORMED CITY Becoming a Trauma- Informed City will require significant changes in attitude, knowledge and practice.To further improve health outcomes that are often worsened by exposure to violence, we must work toward making Chicago a Trauma-Informed City. Trauma-Informed is grounded in service delivery, and directed by a thorough understanding of the neurological, biological, psychological and social effects of trauma and violence on humans and groups. 4 Functioning as a Trauma-Informed City requires significant changes in attitude, knowledge and practice, with all of our city agencies and community-based organizations becoming trained in the impact that trauma has on our residents. Many organizations have already begun this effort by training their staff and community members in the areas of Trauma 101, Mental Health First Aid and Psychological First Aid. A Trauma-Informed City utilizes this knowledge to develop policies and system improvements that ensure effective responses to recovery from trauma and to prevent individuals from being re-traumatized by individuals, schools, churches, organizations and government agencies with which they interact. Chicago will strengthen efforts by collecting new data on the impacts of trauma, discrimination and racism. Chicago will also work toward a shared understanding of how trauma impacts communities and will develop approaches to remediate and build resiliency among those most impacted across Chicago.11CHAPTER 1EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Healthy Chicago 2.0 was developed through direct engagement with community members and part - ner organizations. Along with CDPH, organizations across many sectors have been involved throughout the assessment and planning phases and will be involved with implementation and evaluation. Over 200 individuals from more than 130 agencies helped design this health improvement plan. Healthy Chicago 2.0 is four-year collaborative plan; as such, the goals and objectives outlined in this report will be met only through ongoing, collaborative engagement in the strategies outlined. COMPONENTS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Leverage Partnerships for Promoting Health Equity Build trust, support and rapport by building multi-sector awareness and focusing community mobilization on health equity Funding Opportunities Align and expand funding through collaborative funding models with both private and public entities Educate Community on Public Health Issues Connect Healthy Chicago 2.0 messages about health education and community engagement 12PARTNERSHIPS & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT This chapter outlines strategies to expand partnerships and community engagement. By aligning efforts, Chicago will be better positioned to apply for new and existing funding opportunities. In addition, by working collaboratively across sectors, there is an opportunity to identify new partners in the private and philanthropic communities who could invest in public health. Healthy Chicago 2.0 can also strengthen partnerships across sectors to align co-occurring efforts, including hospital community health needs assessments, local and state policy agendas for non-profit organizations and emerging grant opportunities. By better coordinating efforts, we will maximize our impact.To maximize impact, we must also harness the skills and talents of Chicago's most important asset: its people. By engaging residents in implementation and evaluation, we will build individual capacity, multiply effectiveness and improve sustainability of the plan. 1 This plan ensures that community voices and perspectives are continually engaged through strategy implementation and evaluation efforts. CDPH and partners will periodically assess partner composition and participation and will evaluate decision-making to ensure we have an inclusive process. Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much \u2014Helen Keller\"\"13PARTNERSHIPS & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Establish a public health funding collaborative that will inspire shared and coordinated investments among philanthropy, business and the public sector Make new investments in communities and in interventions that address health inequities Invest hospital community benefit dollars in jointly prioritized areas from hospitals and local public health systems Provide consistent communication to community residents regarding developing efforts at the city level to ensure a Health in All Policies approach to community engagement Leverage the media to educate and engage community members on public health issues Improve the cultural appropriateness of public health messaging to ensure that all residents receive health information they understand and can act on Diversify and develop innovative communication methods utilized by the public health system Support, develop and implement public health policies that are driven by the community Offer trainings for community residents so they can be champions of policies that promote health and quality of carePublic health funding will be coordinated and expanded across philanthropic agencies, the public sector and the private sector Community residents will be active champions for health equityGOAL 1 GOAL 2Strategies StrategiesWhen it comes to health, your zip code matters more than your genetic code. \u2014Tony Iton, MD, JD\" \"15CHAPTER 2ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEAL TH Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.1 In Chicago, residents do not have equitable access to the systems and opportunities that contribute to good health. More than our individual behaviors, it is our homes, schools, workplaces and communities that most impact our health. Income, housing quality, community conditions and education quality are root causes-that is, the things in our environment that support or prevent us from being healthy. The root causes of health include both the social determinants of health and structural inequities, or societal systems that unjustly benefit one population more than another. Health inequities are perpetuated in policies and organizational systems through structural racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, discrimination and stigma. The strategies outlined throughout this plan aim to reduce discrimination and structural inequities. By improving social and structural determinants of health, a significant impact can be achieved for our community's health. As such, Healthy Chicago 2.0 provides actionable strategies to create the necessary policy, systems and environmental changes (PSE) to impact health. PSE emphasizes strategies that impact entire organizations or communities, or that involve physical or material changes to the economic, social or physical environment. Economic development and community improvement efforts will require policy and planning approaches that safeguard against the displacement of families and communities. As conditions are improved in high-need communities, it is essential that those who can benefit most from such improvements are able to remain in their homes and communities. Honoring Chicago's diversity and ensuring inclusiveness of the city are both essential to health equity. Though there are numerous social determinants that impact the health of our communities, four key areas are included in this plan: the built environment, economic development, housing, and education.16ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES Sidewalks and streets, public transit, sewers, parks, community centers and landscaping are part of the built environment. The built environment influences health by providing or preventing opportunities for physical activity, adequate transportation and social connectedness. Inadequate infrastructure for active transportation exists in many low-income communities and communities of color, which are more likely to have poorly maintained sidewalks and streets and increased dangers from traffic. Fatalities from traffic crashes disproportionately impact African American communities. 1 In addition, street design neglects the needs of older adults, people with disabilities and children. Even when physical activity resources are available, some residents may limit the use of these resources due to community safety concerns, lack of transportation or user fees. 2 Chicago is working to end these inequities. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) recently expanded its Divvy bike share program to more communities, north to south from Touhy Avenue to 76th Street and east to west from Lake Michigan to Pulaski. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) recently renovated the south branch of the Red Line, improving an integral transportation corridor through several economically disadvantaged communities. Healthy Chicago 2.0 builds on these successes with additional strategies to ensure the built environment can support and promote health.Climate change also impacts public health. Overall temperatures in Chicago are expected to increase, with severe heat waves projected to occur two to five times per decade by mid-century. There is a trend for increased precipitation during storms, leading to an increased potential for flooding; the timing of precipitation may change, as well. 3 Both heat waves and flooding cause stress on households, with lower income households having fewer resources to recover from such disasters. Healthy Chicago 2.0 will work to minimize the negative effects of climate change. The environment is not well- protected or regulated. We must think about the impact on our health. \u2014Community Conversation Participant\" \"THE BUIL T ENVIRONMENTUS 2010-2014 5-Year EstimateAAB C DE FG I JK L M N OH B C D AREAS with the lowest rate of active transportationto get to workof Chicagoans use ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION I JK L M N O P Q R S TP Q RS TOnlyChicagoans who walk, bike or takepublic transit to work 9.6 - 21.1 %21.2 - 31.5%31.6 42.0 %42.1 - 66.8 % 17ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES18ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES Income inequality in the United States is greater today than at any point since 1928. The top 1% of families have 22.5% of total annual income, while the bottom 90% of families share only 49.6%. 1 The median African American household income in 2014 was only 39.5% of the median white household income. 2 Wealth inequities are even greater, with the richest 20% of US families holding 88.9% of all wealth. 3 This inequity affects not only the health of those with lower incomes and wealth, but also decreases life span and increases illness across the income spectrum, including for those at the very top. 4 As of November 2015, Chicago had an unemployment rate of 8.4% compared to 4.8% nationwide. African Americans in Chicago are more than 2.6 times more likely to be unemployed than whites, 14.7% to 5.7% respectively. Some community areas have unemployment rates as high as 40.4% (Riverdale) and 37.1% (Englewood). Many of those employed do not have jobs that provide a living wage, benefits, safe working conditions, predictable hours and earned sick and family leave. In 2012, only 68% of men and 57% of women in Chicago earned at least $15 an hour. 5 These statistics show that both historical and current patterns of inequities in pay disproportionately disadvantage people of color and women. There has been positive momentum in addressing some of these issues. In 2014, the Chicago City Council passed Mayor Emanuel's minimum wage ordinance that applies incremental raises starting in July 2015 and reaching $13 per hour by 2019, which will lift an estimated70,000 workers out of poverty. 6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The cost of living increases but wages remain the same. \u2014Community Conversation Participant\" \"Unemployment Rate 22.2% - 40.4%14.0 - 22.1%9.4 - 13.9%4.2 - 9.3% COMMUNITY AREAS most 2010-2014 5-Year EstimatesA B CDE FGHI JK L M N O PQ R SA B C D E F G H I JK L M N O P Q R S2.6XAfrican Americans are MORE LIKELY to be unemployed than whites 19ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES20ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES Access to affordable, safe and healthy housing is crucial for supporting people's health. Poor housing conditions are associated with infectious diseases, chronic diseases, injuries, poor child development and mental illness. Specific examples include respiratory infections and conditions like asthma, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lead poisoning and psychological distress. Lack of affordable housing can restrict where people live and the quality of the places in which they live; it can also impact the proportion of household income spent on housing. 1,2 Chicago's housing stock is old, with 54% of homes built before 1950. Many of the buildings that have not been appropriately maintained, renovated or repaired have home-based hazards that put families at risk of serious health problems. A significant housing-related health threat in some homes is childhood lead poisoning, often caused by ingesting and breathing in lead-based paint dust. Housing hazards are often related to poverty. Families living in or near poverty have fewer affordable options and can end up in housing that is less likely to be maintained, with poor insulation, broken windows and inefficient wiring. This leads to higher utility costs, which make it even harder to afford remediation of the health hazards.Almost 40% of households in Chicago spend more than one-third of their monthly income on either rent or their mortgage. In the Hermosa community, 52% of all households experienced this housing cost burden. Severe housing cost burden, meaning 50% of income is spent on housing, is related to higher incidence of death from heart disease and other chronic diseases. 6 Stable housing is recognized as an important and effective intervention for individuals with chronic health problems. In a recent study, 96% of individuals in permanent supportive housing were still permanently housed at the end of a year, compared to only 34% of those in an emergency shelter and 66% of those in interim housing. 7 HOUSING Healthy people are those who live in healthy homes on a healthy diet; in an environment equally fit for birth, growth, work, healing and dying. \u2014Ivan Illich\" \"0.0 -

childhood education programs increase school performance and high school graduation rates. They are associated with decreases in crime rates and teen birth rates. When provided to low-income or racial and ethnic minority communities, early childhood education programs are likely to reduce educational achievement gaps, improve the health of these student populations and promote health equity. 1 In 2014, 18.4% of Chicago adults did not have a high school diploma; among Hispanics that rate is 40.5%. 2 Inequities are also seen geographically, as adults in community areas on the West and South Sides are less likely to have a college degree. Quality of education can also vary across community areas. Level 1+ schools, or the highest performing schools in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system, represent 22% of all CPS schools but their locations do not match those areas with large populations of children. Most children lack access to the highest performing CPS schools and must attend the 78% of CPS schools that are not the highest performing schools. 3 School environments can also decrease educational opportunity. For example, many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) youth report hostile school environments, which may lead to increased dropout rates. Nationally, 86% of LGB high school students experience harassment at school on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, with 61% of students feeling unsafe because of their sexual orientation. 4 Additionally, homelessness impacts school mobility and attendance rates for students. During the 2014-2015 school year, 20,250 CPS students were in a temporary living situation. While CPS provides supports to ensure students in such situations have transportation and other resources to keep attending class, lack of stable housing significantly impacts the homeless students success.

This includes prevention and treatment services for physical, behavioral and oral health as well as support services, such as transportation, food assistance, childcare and assistance enrolling in and using health insurance. Health departments and other members of the public health system link people to needed personal health services and assure provision of health care and a competent workforce and evaluate the effectiveness, accessibility and quality of these services. CHAPTER 3 INCREASING ACCESS TO HEAL TH CARE & HUMAN SERVICES30INCREASING ACCESS Being insured is a major component of access to care. Adults who lack health insurance have less access to clinical care and preventive services. 1 Health insurance is essential for the half of all adults who have at least one chronic disease and need ongoing care to manage and control their conditions. 2 With health insurance, children are much more likely to have medical homes and obtain well-child and developmental services to prevent health problems; insured children are more likely to have fewer unmet health needs. 3 Given the rise of children at risk for chronic health problems (e.g., obesity, diabetes and asthma), health insurance coverage improves their ability to obtain care to address these problems early. Many public health system agencies are involved in helping individuals and families enroll in Marketplace and Medicaid health plans. Even more organizations monitor the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Illinois Medicaid health reform and advocate for comprehensive benefits. These services expand the number of residents with insurance improving health outcomes across the city.In addition to health insurance status, many other factors influence a person's access to and use of health care services. Healthy Chicago 2.0 addresses the following interrelated components: availability, affordability, appropriateness, effectiveness, equitability and consumer involvement and use of the health system. Human services are an integral component of this system, as they provide assistance with daily needs such as housing, food, transportation, jobs and dependent care. A culturally-effective approach integrates knowledge about populations into specific standards, policies and practices to improve the quality of care, thereby producing better health outcomes. People have a choice of health plans, but care varies and there is a lot of confusion about the plans. \u2014Community Conversation Participant\" \"AB C D E F G H US Census, American Community Survey, 2010-2014 5-Year EstimateIJ KLMNO P Q RSPeople with no health insurance Community Areas with High Economic Hardship 22.4 - 34.8%18.5 - 22.3%14.1 - 18.4%3.9 - 14.0% 18.7% COMMUNITY have A B C D E F G H I JK L M N O P Q R SNO HEALTH INSURANCEPeople with no health insurance Community Areas with High Economic Hardship 22.4 - 34.8%18.5 - 22.3%14.1 - 18.4%3.9 - 14.0% 18.7% COMMUNITY have A B C D E F G H I JK L M N O P Q R SNO HEALTH INSURANCE 31INCREASING ACCESS Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid ex - pansion in 2014, more people have access to health insurance. Over 75,000 Chicagoans enrolled in Marketplace health plans for 2015 and over 206,000 are enrolled in Medicaid expansion plans for adults (19-64 years of age). 4,5 Data show variations in 2014 Chicago health insurance coverage rates based on demographic characteristics. 6 Some of the largest inequities occur by race/ethnicity; whites have the lowest uninsured rates (10.4%) compared to African Americans (18.6 %), Asians (19%) and Hispanics (28.1 %). 6 Individuals living below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) have the highest uninsured rate at 27.1%, compared to individ- uals earning between 138% and 199% FPL (26.8%) and those living at or above 200% FPL (12.3%).6 Education levels show similar patterns to health insurance coverage. Individuals without a high school diploma have the highest rate of be - ing uninsured (35.4%), compared to high school graduates (29.2%), those with some college (21.5%) or a bachelor's degree (9.5%). 6 The more education you have, the more likely you are to have health insurance and access to quality health care. Other factors influence access but are more difficult to measure. One of these factors is the quality of health care services. Although health and human service providers recognize the importance of high quality care and regularly adjust their systems to improve it, few data indicators are available to measure the following areas: culturally-effective care, the provision of evidence-based treatments and interventions, and consum-ers' ability to navigate the health and human service system. To address these concerns, Healthy Chicago 2.0 calls for adding specific quality and access questions to the annual Healthy Chicago Survey to document some of these measures. As these data become avail- able, the action team will identify populations in need and implement evidence-based/ informed strategies to reduce in- equities.CURRENT STATECOMPONENTS OF ACCESS Availability of Services Proximity, hours, correct array of services, appropriate capacity Affordability of Services Insurance, payment, coverage, charity care Appropriate, Effective and Equitable Services Socially, culturally and linguistically effective;

Even so, public health challenges remain. Healthy Chicago 2.0 places a renewed emphasis on improving health outcomes by focusing on communities that continue to face the greatest challenges in five priority areas: Promoting Behavioral Health Strengthening Child and Adolescent Health Preventing and Controlling Chronic Disease Preventing Infectious Disease Reducing Violence 36IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES The health priorities for Healthy Chicago 2.0 represent a broad set of issues that contribute significantly to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in our city. To promote health and improve quality of life for all Chicagoans, it is necessary not only to address the social determinants, but also to address the diseases themselves and sub-populations most affected. Healthy Chicago 2.0 objectives and strategies focus on risk factors, access to resources and outcomes so improvements in behavioral health, child and adolescent health, chronic disease, infectious disease and violence are citywide and equitable.Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman. \u2014Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\" \"Life Expectancy at Birth (in years) Community Areas with High EconomicHardship 67.1 - 73.7 Chicago: GG HCOMMUNITY AREAS with the lowest life expectancy Illinois Department of Public Health, 20125 years lower5 years lowerThe LIFE EXPECTANCYof Chicagoansin areas of high economic hardship is than those living inbetter economic conditions H I IJ JK KL LM MN NO OP PQ QR R S S T T 37IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMESBehavioral Health Hospitalizations * (age-adjusted rate per 10,000 persons) 63.2 227 per 10,000Areas with High Economic Hardship 60,031 A B C DE F GZIP CODES most aected by behavioral health hospitalizationsbehavioral healthhospitalizationsin Chicago Almost TWICE as many as for heart disease (33,689)In 2011, there were 60644 606246061260653606366062160637 38IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Promoting Behavioral Health Behavioral health is the state of successful mental function resulting in engagement in productive activities, fulfilling relationships and the ability to adapt to change or cope with challenges. Behavioral health is essential to personal well-being, family and interpersonal relationships and the ability to contribute to society. Behavioral health disorders include both mental health and substance use disorders. Across the United States and Canada, behavioral health disorders are among the most common causes of disability, accounting for 25% of all years of life lost. 1 According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in any given year, an estimated 13 million American adults\u2014approximately one in 17 Americans\u2014have a seriously debilitating mental illness. 2,3 People with serious mental illnesses are more likely to have one or more chronic medical conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and kidney disease. 4 Lifestyle factors, medication side effects and inequities in health care access contribute to poor health outcomes for this population. 5 Furthermore, the stigmatization of mental illness has a strong impact on quality of life, constricting opportunities for satisfying employment and adequate income, healthy and safe housing, the receipt of quality behavioral and medical care and supportive social networks. Stigma also contributes to chronic stress. Traumatic experiences, including experiences of abuse, neglect, family dysfunction, violence, natural disasters, loss, discrimination, racism, oppression and poverty, can cause significant emotional pain and distress. Trauma is a common experience that affects all aspects of life, putting people who experience it at the risk of both physical and behavioral health problems. People who experienced trauma in childhood have increased odds of substance use, mental health problems, risky behaviors, obesity, chronic lung disease, cancer, liver disease and ischemic heart disease, among other issues. 6 Evidence- based models are available to treat trauma and reduce its harmful effects. By reducing stigma, increasing evidence-based prevention and treatment opportunities and ensuring residents most in need have access to those opportunities, we can improve the behavioral health of residents across Chicago.PROMOTING BEHAVIORAL HEAL TH The state mental health system is broken and under-resourced and rendered ineffective by the politics. \u2014Community Conversation Participant\" \"Illinois Department of Public Health, 2011A B C D E FGBehavioral Health Hospitalizations * (age-adjusted rate per 10,000 persons) 63.2 227 per 10,000Areas with High Economic Hardship 60,031 A B C DE F GZIP CODES most aected by behavioral health hospitalizationsbehavioral healthhospitalizationsin Chicago Almost TWICE as many as for heart disease (33,689)In 2011, there were 60644 606246061260653606366062160637Behavioral Health Hospitalizations * (age-adjusted rate per 10,000 227 per 10,000Areas with High Economic Hardship 60,031 A B C DE F GZIP CODES most aected by behavioral health hospitalizationsbehavioral healthhospitalizationsin Chicago Almost TWICE as many as for heart disease (33,689)In 2011, there were 60644 606246061260653606366062160637Behavioral Health Hospitalizations * (age-adjusted rate per 10,000 227 per 10,000Areas with High Economic Hardship 60,031 A B C DE F GZIP CODES most aected by behavioral health hospitalizationsbehavioral healthhospitalizationsin Chicago Almost TWICE as many as for heart disease (33,689)In 2011, there were 60644 606246061260653606366062160637 *Includes hospitalizations for the and disruptive behavior disorders; delirium, dementia and cognitive disorders; autistic disorder and other developmental disorders; anxiety, depression, bipolar and other mood disorders; schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders; alcohol- and substance-related disorders; suicide and self-inflicted injury 39IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Promoting Behavioral Health CURRENT STATE Many Chicagoans suffer from mental health and substance use disorders. Survey data indicate that 9% of Chicago adults experienced poor mental health for 14 or more days in the past month and 5% had symptoms indicative of serious psychological distress. 7 About one-third (32.5%) of Chicago youth report feelings of sadness that lasted for two weeks or more during the last 30 days. 8 Furthermore, 29% of Chicago adults report binge drinking in the past 30 days.9 In 2011, there were 60,031 hospitalizations for behavioral health-related conditions. While behavioral health problems are very common and effective treatments are available, many people do not participate in treatment. 7There are multiple barriers to obtaining behavioral health services and supports. Funding and workforce shortages threaten Chicago's behavioral health treatment resources and affect access for some residents. Other Chicagoans need more information about how to use insurance for behavioral health treatment or where to obtain care. Cost, stigma, language and cultural barriers and lack of transportation are additional issues that create challenges to receiving needed services. Inadequate and uncoordinated systems are a significant problem, as evi- denced in part by the high numbers of homeless or incarcerated people with behavioral health problems.

Healthy Chicago 2.0 seeks to strengthen child and adolescent health by focusing on a number of key areas that will close inequities across the age spectrum: reducing infant mortality, expanding health options for new families, reducing teen birth rates and expanding health services in schools. These strategies will result in immediate improvements in the health of children, as well as their long-term health as they enter adulthood. Schools are uniquely positioned to provide services to students who might not otherwise have access to health care services. There is incentive for schools to provide services because health has been shown to have an impact on academic performance. 2 Successful school- based programs address conditions that (1) have high prevalence, (2) are associated with adverse consequences, (3) are treatable, (4) have a screening test available and (5) can be reliably funded. 3 Giving birth to a child before completion of high school has adverse consequences for both mothers and children. Children of teen parents are more likely to be pre-term or low birthweight and to suffer health consequences as a result. They are more likely to grow up in poverty, grow up in environments with less cognitive stimulation and emotional support, and have lower school achievement. Girls who have children at a young age are less likely to continue their education, which can affect lifelong opportunity. 4 Reducing teen pregnancy is a poverty prevention strategy that will affect the health of mothers and children.STRENGTHENING CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEAL TH The ability to plan, prevent, and space pregnancies is directly linked to more educational and economic opportunities, healthier babies, more stable families, fewer abortions, and a reduced burden for taxpayers. \u2014The National Campaign \" \"Illinois Department of Public Health, 2009-2013 5-Year EstimateE FA B C DG H I J K L M2.2 - 4.7 4.8 - 6.66.7 - 8.38.4 - 11.211.3 - 17.1Low number of births Community Areas with High Economic HardshipInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births) Chicago rate: 7.8 per 1,000 births306306 citywide INFANT DEATHS in 2013 A B C D EWest Garfield Park North LawndaleGrand BoulevardWest EnglewoodEnglewoodGreater Grand CrossingWoodlawnSouth ShoreAuburn GreshamChathamWashinton Heights Roseland Morgan Park COMMUNITY AREAS most impacted F GH I J K L M DOUBLEDOUBLE Washington Heights, Chatham, and West Garfield Park have INFANT MORTALITY RATES that are more than the citywide rate2.2 - 4.7 4.8 - 6.66.7 - 8.38.4 - 11.211.3 - 17.1Low number of births Community Areas with High Economic HardshipInfant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births) Chicago rate: 7.8 per 1,000 births306306 citywide INFANT DEATHS in 2013 A B C D EWest Garfield Park North LawndaleGrand BoulevardWest EnglewoodEnglewoodGreater Grand CrossingWoodlawnSouth ShoreAuburn GreshamChathamWashinton Heights Roseland Morgan Park COMMUNITY AREAS most impacted F GH I J K L M DOUBLEDOUBLE Washington Heights, Chatham, and West Garfield Park have INFANT MORTALITY RATES that are more than the citywide rate43IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Strengthening Child & Adolescent Health African American infants are more than four times as likely as white in-fants to die before their first birthday. African American infants are also more likely to be born preterm when compared to white and Hispanic infants. In Cook County, approximately 1.5% of infants are born very low birth weight and 3% of infants are born with diagnosed birth defects; all of these children are eligible for Early Intervention services, but only 1.7% of infants receive these services. 5 Improvements in cognitive, language, physical, social and emotional abilities can be made when interventions are initiated early. However, it is estimated that only 20-30% of children with a developmental delay are identified before entering school. 6 Use of a developmental screening tool has been found to identify approximately three times as many children in need of services compared to when providers rely on their own clinical judg-ment. 4 In Chicago, there were 3,241 teen births in 2013. Though this number represents a serious decline from previous years, Chicago's teen birth rate remains 1.5 times the rate nationally. Hispanic and African American teens are over four times more likely to give birth than white teens, and the rates in communities with low child opportunity are up to 20 times that of rates in areas with plentiful opportunities for children. Through partnerships with Chicago Public Schools and the Archdio - cese of Chicago, CDPH provides vision services, dental services and STI screening services to more than 150,000 students annually, a number expected to increase as part of the goals outlined in Healthy Chicago 2.0. In addition, CDPH and its partners will work to ensure greater ac - cess to quality care for new mothers and infants and institute new strategies to further decrease the number of teen births.

Improvements have been seen in smoking and in physical activity among Chicago youth, and obesity rates appear to be stabilizing in children entering kindergarten. However, similar to adults, the distribution of health risk behaviors and chronic diseases and conditions is not equitable. Inequities in physical activity, smoking, asthma and obesity exist by gender, race-ethnicity, sexual orientation and geography. 3 The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) recommends addressing chronic disease prevention and control at the individual and population level through coordinated efforts between government agencies and public and private partners, including epidemiology and surveillance, environmental approaches, health care system interventions and community-clinical linkages. Policies changing the context and making healthy lifestyles easier, safer, cheaper and more convenient (e.g., improving social and physical environments) are more likely to help end inequities in chronic disease. Improvements in the delivery and use of quality clinical services can prevent and detect chronic diseases early and manage risk factors better. Finally, ensuring people with or at high risk for chronic diseases have access to effective community resources can help to prevent or manage chronic diseases. 2,5 PREVENTING & CONTROLLING CHRONIC DISEASEA BCD E F GH IJ KLMN O P R Chicago Public Schools, 2012-2013Q SObesity Rates among K, 6th, & 9th Graders in Chicago Public Schools 12 - 16 % 17 - 21 % 22 - 24 % 25 - 27 % 28 - 32 % A B C D EMontclaire Belmont-CraginHermosaAvondaleLogan SquareHumboldt ParkAshburnBurnsideSouth DeeringEast Side F G H I JK L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted RQ S19%19% of all CPS kids are OBESEObesity Rates among K, 6th, & 9th Graders in Chicago Public Schools 12 - 16 % 17 - 21 % 22 - 24 % 25 - 27 % 28 - 32 % A B C D EMontclaire Belmont-CraginHermosaAvondaleLogan SquareHumboldt ParkAshburnBurnsideSouth DeeringEast Side F G H I JK L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted RQ S19%19% of all CPS kids are OBESE Obesity Rates among K, 6th, & 9th Graders in Chicago Public Schools 12 - 16 % 17 - 21 % 22 - 24 % 25 - 27 % 28 - 32 % A B C D EMontclaire Belmont-CraginHermosaAvondaleLogan SquareHumboldt ParkAshburnBurnsideSouth DeeringEast Side F G H I JK L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted RQ S19%19% of all CPS kids are OBESE47IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Preventing & Controlling Chronic Disease CURRENT STATE Chronic diseases and conditions are a significant health burden.

Hospitalizations due to heart disease, cancer, stroke, asthma and diabetes totaled more than 67,000 in 2011. 3 One in four adults in Chicago were obese in 2014, and one in five kindergarteners enrolled in Chicago Public Schools were obese in the 2012-2013 academic year. In 2014, 29.2% of adults consumed the recommended five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily, while less than 20% of high school students did the same in 2013. Even though more than half of adults met the recommendations for physical activity in 2014, 18.3% of adults participated in no physical activity or exercise. In 2013, only 19.6% of high school students met the recommended federal physical activity guidelines for youth, i.e., daily exercise for 60 minutes. 3 Chicago has made progress in reducing smoking among youth; 25% of high school students reported smoking in 2001 compared to 10.7% in 2013. However, smoking in adults has not significantly decreased since 2000, and as of 2014, 18.4% of Chicago adults report being current smokers. 3 Clinical preventive services such as can-cer screenings and immunizations are in-strumental in reduc - ing morbidity and mortality through pre - vention and early de - tection. Despite the Affordable Care Act covering these ser - vices for consumers, a number of Chica-goans go without the vaccinations and tests that can protect them from developing cancer. 3,6 In Chicago, 75.6% of women met the breast cancer screening guidelines, with no difference by racial-ethnic group or community hardship. Overall, female breast cancer incidence in Chicago increased by 10% between 1992 and 2011. White women have the high-est rates of breast cancer incidence in Chicago. However, breast cancer mortality is highest among African American women. Differential quality in mammography and treatment are thought to play a role in this ongo - ing inequity between white and African American women. 7 Seventy percent of all cervical cancers are associated with two types of HPV. The HPV vaccine is the first of its kind to prevent cancer and is recommended for both male and female adolescents. 8 Chicago's HPV vaccine coverage rates have increased significantly since 2013 and CDPH's efforts are now seen as a national model. While Chicago's vaccination rates outpaced state and national rates, there continues to be room for improvement. In 2014, just over half (53%) of Chicago's female adolescent population ages 13 to 17 received all three doses of the HPV vaccine, while only about a quarter (26%) of male adolescents received three doses. 9 Hospitalizations and emergency room visits are indicative of poor - ly controlled asthma. 10 Although rates of asthma hospitaliza-tion among children 0-5 years of age have decreased over 50% in the past decade, Chicago's hospitaliza-tion rate is double the national rate. Both African American and Hispanic children are hospitalized more often than white chil-dren. 3 18%Only of high school students eat fruits & vegetables at recommended levels African American adults

By improving surveillance, education and prevention measures, including immunizations, we can protect more individuals from current and emerging infections. Transmission rates for many sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be reduced by safer sex practices, including consistent condom use. Efforts in infectious disease control also include ensuring the appropriate infrastructure exists to assist individuals living with chronic infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and HIV/AIDS. By ensuring access to specialty care services, people living with HCV and HIV/AIDS are able to avoid life-threatening complications. By expanding access to HCV and HIV prevention information and resources, including PrEP for HIV prevention, we can drive down new diagnoses.REDUCING THE BURDEN OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Chlamydia among 15-19 year old females (rate per 100,000) A B C D EFG H IJ K L M N O P Chicago Department of Public Health, 20146,287 reported cases of CHLAMYDIA among 15-19 year old females in 2014 A B C D EAustin West Garfield G HI J K L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS with highest ratesChlamydia Rate (per 100,000 females aged 15-19 years) Low & Very Low ChildOpportunity Areas0 Chicago 1,014 per 100,000 persons 6,287 reported cases of CHLAMYDIA among 15-19 year old females in 2014 A B C D Garfield G HI J K L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS with highest ratesChlamydia Rate (per 100,000 females aged 15-19 years) Low & Very Low ChildOpportunity Areas0 Chicago rate: 1,014 per 100,000 persons 53IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Reducing the Burden of Infectious Disease Of the 27,320 chlamydia cases reported in Chicago during 2014, almost 9,000 were among teenagers. The regions within Chicago with the highest case rates are located on the west and south sides of the city and include communities with low levels of child opportunity. In the community areas of North Lawndale and West Garfield Park the chlamydia rate is three times the city average and more than six times the national rate. Through 2013, there were 22,875 people reported living with HIV/AIDS in Chicago, with an additional 973 new HIV diagnoses reported in 2014. Of the new HIV diagnoses, 53% were among African Americans and 78.3% were among men who have sex with men. The latest HIV surveillance data indicates that 80% of residents with new HIV diagnoses were engaged in HIV medical care within the first three months of diagnosis; however among all persons living with HIV, only 55% are currently engaged in care. This drop-off in receiving ongoing medical care demonstrates a need to identify gaps and new methods to keep individuals engaged in routine HIV medical care. Approximately, 2.7 million people in the US are living with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 2 a disease that may result in liver cancer or cirrhosis, leading to liver failure and death without a liver transplant. Approximately, 50% of those infected with chronic HCV are not aware of their diagnosis and 20-30% of those chronically infected will develop end-stage liver disease. African Americans bear a particularly heavy burden of disease, representing over 50% of cases for which race information is available. There is now a cure for HCV that is effective in 90-99% of patients with the most frequent type of HCV. However, curative treatment is largely only available to those with advanced HCV disease.

It's also an economic issue for our country. When, generation after generation, they lag behind, our economy suffers. Our family structure suffers. Our civic life suffers. Cycles of hopelessness breed violence and mistrust. And our country is less than what we know it can be. So we need to change the statistics \u2014 not just for the sake of the young men and boys, but for the sake of America's future. \u2014Barak Obama, 2014Violence is a significant public health problem in Chicago. It affects all people, from infants to the elderly, during all stages of life. Violence occurs within families, schools and communities. Yet violence is not inevitable; it is preventable. There is a growing list of interventions and policies that have been shown to be effective in preventing violence. Most effective prevention approaches work by focusing on modifiable identified risk and protective factors. Those involved in supporting individuals, families, communities and systems should focus on removing risk factors and ensuring protective factors are in place that protect against violence. The use of restorative practices has proven to provide a safe and caring environment and a reduction in bullying and other interpersonal conflicts. While the effects of trauma induced by violence may vary from person to person, there is a predictably profound impact on learning, behavior and health. 1 Individual choices, parenting and family functioning, school climate and resources, the physical and social environment of communities, access to services and many factors within the social environment influence the overall risk of violence and injury. 2,3 Addressing these root causes requires the time, commitment and resources of Chicago's many dedicated partners across multiple sectors. Related to the unequal burden of violence and trauma is the problem of mass incarceration and disproportionate contact between police and communities of color. The burden of arrest records and convictions has been found to have a life-altering, disabling impact on individuals' educational and employment opportunities, as well as a negative impact on their families. 4 Research suggests that uneven patterns of police deployment and engagement and sentencing discrepancies for similar offenses contribute to escalated tensions between police and disadvantaged communities. 5,6 These additional burdens are felt by at-risk communities and the law enforcement community alike.REDUCING VIOLENCE \" \"A B C D E F GH I J KL MN O P Q R Illinois Department of Public Health, 20130.5 - 4.1 4.2 - 5.6 5.8 - 10.510.6 - 29.6 30.6 - 46.9 Chicago rate: 10.8 per 100,000390390 Firearm-related HOMICIDES in 2014 A B C D EWest North LawndaleFuller ParkWashington Riverdale F G H IJ K L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted by gun violence RQ9,5779,577 Gun-related VIOLENT CRIMES in public places in 2014in 2014NON-FATAL SHOOTINGS2,4352,435Firearm-related Homicide Rate (per 100,000)0.5 - 4.1 4.2 - 5.6 5.8 - 10.510.6 - 29.6 30.6 - 46.9 Chicago rate: 10.8 per 100,000390390 Firearm-related HOMICIDES in 2014 A B C D EWest North LawndaleFuller ParkWashington PullmanRiverdale F G H IJ K L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted by gun violence RQ9,5779,577 Gun-related VIOLENT CRIMES in public places in 2014in 2014NON-FATAL SHOOTINGS2,4352,435Firearm-related Homicide Rate (per 100,000) 0.5 - 4.1 4.2 - 5.6 5.8 - 10.510.6 - 29.6 30.6 - 46.9 Chicago rate: 10.8 per 100,000390390 Firearm-related HOMICIDES in 2014 A PullmanRiverdale F G H IJ K L M N O PCOMMUNITY AREAS most impacted by gun violence RQ9,5779,577 Gun-related VIOLENT CRIMES in public places in 2014in 2014NON-FATAL SHOOTINGS2,4352,435Firearm-related Homicide Rate (per 100,000) 57IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Reducing Violence The prevention of violence is a top public health priority. In 2014, there were 390 fatalities due to firearm-related homicide and 2,435 non-fatal shootings. 7,8 Homicide is the number one killer of youth ages 15 to 24 in Chicago.9 Exposure to community violence leads to a host of negative outcomes for individuals, families and society, contributing to disability, poor mental health, high medical costs and lost productivity. 2 In 2014, 11,340 individuals were serviced by domestic violence agencies. Overall homicides in Chicago have decreased significantly in the last 40 years from 970 in 1972 to 432 in 2014, even so, violence continues to persist in select communities and leading to negative health outcomes. West Garfield Park has the highest homicide rate in the city, which is four times higher than the city-wide average and 80 times higher than the rate in Lincoln Park. Data demonstrate that the experience of violence among youth is all too common. A 2013 study conducted in Chicago com-munities most impacted by violence found that among 15-17-year-olds, 87% had been exposed to some form of violence, 32% had a close friend or family member mur - dered, and 18% had witnessed a shooting that resulted in death. 10 Additionally, 17% of youth report being involved in a physical fight on school grounds in the last year, and just over 10% of Chicago youth were bullied. Furthermore, 9% experienced sexual dating violence and 12% experienced physical dating violence in the past year, and 13% of Chicago youth did not go to school within the last 30 days because they felt unsafe. 11 While violent crime occurs in all communities, violent crime dispropor - tionately affects residents living in Chicago communities of color that have high hardship. 12 Over the past two years, Mayor Emanuel's Com- mission for a Safer Chicago has worked across city agencies and hun-dreds of neighborhood organizations, community leaders, and youth to develop initiatives that focus on risk reduction (e.g., early intervention), and promote protective factors (e.g., mentoring, social supports and employment). Through the Commission's collaborative efforts, we have begun to see new progress in our communities. Healthy Chicago 2.0 builds off these successes and will expand efforts to reduce risk factors and intervene in the root causes that lead to violence while strengthening protec - tive factors.CURRENT STATE2,435 Non-Fatal Shootings 390 Gun-RelatedHomicides 18xChicago's gun related homicides are 3 times the National Average Gun related homicides within Chicago's African American Population is 8 times the National Average Gun-related homicides within Chicago's African American Male Population are 18 times the National Average3x 8x 1 in 8 high school students missed school due to safety concerns BULLIEDThe rate more than doubles to for LGB high schoolers13%of all Chicago high schoolers are 29% 58IMPROVING HEAL TH OUTCOMES Reducing Violence Objective Reduce rate of gun-related homicides among African American males by 20% Objective Reduce non-fatal shootings by 20% Objectives Reduce violent crimes involving a gun in public spaces by 20% Decrease bullying of LGBTQ high school students by 10% Decrease high school absenteeism due to safety issues by 20% Increase social cohesion among Chicago communities Decrease in-school interpersonal violence by 25%Decrease incidence of victimization and exposure to violence and strengthen community protective factorsGOAL 1 Strategies Identify and engage youth and their families at greatest risk for involvement in serious violence in evidence-based/informed prevention, Early Intervention and response services Ensure timely and effective post-homicide incident debriefing, support to survivors and retaliation assessment Conduct positive hot spot loitering and risk analysis in high incidence zones Implement post-incident analysis Strategies Expand the availability of high-quality, evidence-based after-school and summer programs focusing on disadvantaged youth Promote services and resources dedicated to providing navigation and support services to disconnected adolescents between the ages of 18-24 Offer training opportunities to community providers and staff within local schools on violence and trauma, including topics such as early signs of psychological distress;

We analyzed health risk behaviors and disease outcomes according to characteristics such as income, geography, race, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation. We also compared social, economic and physical environments. We engaged community members and stakeholders to guide collection and analysis and partnered with others to collect qualitative data. We also shared the results with community members, seeking their guidance on prioritizing the issues outlined in this plan. 62DATA AND RESEARCH Data Access Improving data literacy, quality and access is an integral part of the Healthy Chicago 2.0 plan to ensure residents, policymakers, researchers and entrepreneurs have the opportunity to utilize the many sources of health data to understand and foster equity. Additionally, non-traditional data sources such as legal, land use, housing, marketing, workforce, education, business, insurance and program service data need to be liberated to fully elucidate root causes of health inequities. Where no baseline data exists, we will take steps to collect and analyze new data to better inform strategies that address health inequities. Of course, access alone is not sufficient to ensure that data are used to their maximum potential. Strategies to develop quality standards in data collection and dissemination and strategies to improve proficiency in understanding the limitations and potential uses of data will be developed and implemented across the four years of the plan. High-quality, accessible data that are responsibly used can provide an unprecedented evidence base for developing interventions that toward improve health outcomes.Public Health Research All public health research needs to be coordinated and disseminated widely. This presents an opportunity for a citywide research agenda to be adopted with a focus on achieving health equity and informing and evaluating strategies to address the Healthy Chicago 2.0 goals. Chicago is rich with academic institutions and private non-profit research firms. It is time for our city to increase our embrace of collaborative and innovative approaches to research that improves the health of Chicago communities. This plan calls for a focus on health equity in research and evaluation efforts that assess how potential or current strategies address inequities. Evaluations and research designed with a health equity lens clarify what works, for whom and under what conditions. Evaluation and research questions guide the evaluation process; it is critical that our health equity measurements be outlined from the beginning. Focusing on leveraging data and research to design, implement and measure the objectives in Healthy Chicago 2.0 will help us better understand, measure and iterate desired health outcomes through an equity lens, further improving the health of all residents. There's a lack of a unified or consistent medical documentation system to share information across healthcare providers, facilities and payers. \u2014Community Conversation Participant\" \"63DATA AND RESEARCH Strategies Leverage existing informatics initiatives Conduct an environmental scan of health data systems and disseminate a report summarizing health data for use in Chicago Establish technical data sharing infrastructure and data quality standards Develop and implement training tools and infrastructure addressing data literacy needs Propose intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional policies that address the 14 Illinois laws that govern privacy Promote current initiatives within the City of Chicago Tech Plan and other initiatives such as the City Data Learnathons Identify methods for collecting new indicators to measure root causes of health inequities Strategies Establish an independent Health Advisory Board that makes recommendations based on Health Impact Assessment outcomes Develop a sustainable structure for tracking and coordinating Chicago public health research Develop mechanisms, with organized community input, to facilitate the dissemination and use of findings from Chicago public health research Encourage local research institutions to develop promotion criteria that incentivize local research dissemination Develop linkages with local media outlets to disseminate research findingsHigh quality data are accessible and equitable Chicago's public health research will be coordinated and disseminated widelyGOAL 1 GOAL 2Objectives Launch city-wide public health data partnership by July 1, 2016 Establish a functional data sharing network by July 1, 2017 Develop and deploy infrastructure for addressing data literacy by the end of 2017 Establish a public health-driven framework for evidence-based policymaking Objectives Establish and adopt Chicago public health research principles of engagement by June 2016 to ensure equitable design, conduct, and use of research to further health equity in Chicago Adopt a Chicago-wide health research agenda by December 2017 Establish a CDPH Research and Evaluation Office that develops internal processes and procedures for research participation, collaboration and tracking65Healthy Chicago 2.0 is an ambitious public health plan. Launching the plan is just the first step in addressing the root causes of poor health and achieving the healthy equity that Chicagoans deserve. The true challenge for CDPH and our partners will be fully executing the plan over the next four years so we can realize the improvements outlined throughout this plan. Healthy Chicago 2.0 strategy implementation will be carried out collaboratively and will be aligned, as much as possible, with the work of other public health stakeholders. The writing of this report coincides with the development of the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP), which has prioritized [social determinants of health], access to care, maternal and child health, chronic disease and behavioral health. Going forward, as Healthy Chicago 2.0 partners lead implementation across these areas, we will share outcomes with Illinois Department of Public Health regularly and work together to implement common strategies.CHAPTER 6TAKING THE NEXT STEP66TAKING THE NEXT STEP Assembling Implementation Teams CDPH will convene implementation teams consisting of strategy leaders, experts in the field, community-based organizations and community residents. These teams will develop a comprehensive 18 month work plan. CDPH and a community stakeholder will chair each implementation team and these teams will guide the work over the next four years. We will also engage aldermen and public and private funders, and will seek additional grant dollars to support the implementation of Healthy Chicago 2.0. Monitoring Our Progress For the first time ever, CDPH has the ability to collect community area data that will assist us in measuring progress on all 82 objectives through the Healthy Chicago Survey, Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) Vital Statistics data sets, IDPH Inpatient and Outpatient Hospitalization Discharge data, the U.S. Census, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, as well as other government agency data, from such agencies as the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Transportation, Chicago Public Schools and others. CDPH will report on progress made across all action areas quarterly and will disseminate an annual report that provides progress on all objectives and strategies outlined in the plan. The following pages outline all plan objectives with quantifiable indicators. We fully intend to be nimble in our data collection by 1) adding new measures and 2) making changes to existing measures that may more accurately demonstrate our ability to improve certain social and health outcomes. All plan updates and progress reports will be located here: www.cityofchicago.org/HealthyChicago2.067TAKING THE NEXT STEP Continually Gathering Feedback To ensure community residents, stakeholders and public health leaders are engaged in the implementation of Healthy Chicago 2.0, we will host a series of community events to share the plan and gather feedback on plans for implementation. We will continuously work with communities to support implementation efforts and evaluate the progress being made. If you have feedback or would like to join our efforts, please email healthychicago@cityofchicago.org. By working together, we will be able to ensure Chicago is a city where all residents have the opportunity to realize health and well-being.68HEAL THY CHICAGO 2.0 INDICATORS Baseline Data & 2020
