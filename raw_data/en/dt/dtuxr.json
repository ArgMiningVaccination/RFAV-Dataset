Vol. 07-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rule-making documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 06-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2006; Bulletin 07-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2007. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 07-1 refers to January 2007; Volume No. 07-2 refers to February 2007; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2007 is cited as Volume 07-1. The December 2006 Bulletin is cited as Volume 06-12. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are only published in the Bulletin and not printed in the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rule making activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 5 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format;d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule;b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective;d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule reviewed by the legislature and not rejected, amended or modified becomes final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule wa s submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Yearly subscriptions or individual copies are available for purchase. The Idaho Administrative Code , is an annual compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable temporary administrative rules and includes a ta ble of contents, reference guides, and a subject index. Individual Rule Chapters and Individual RuleMaking Dockets , are specific portions of the Bulletin and Administrative Code produced on demand. Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address : http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially us ing a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-0701 ). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0701\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0701\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rule-making action published in calendar year 2007. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2007 would be designated as \" 0702\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 0702. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITA TIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. \"201\" denotes the main Section number of the rule to which the citation refers. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 August 1, 2007 -

Williams Building West Conference Room 700 West State Street, Boise, ID 83720 DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Idaho Technology Competency Assessment (ITCA) is no longer a relevant measurement of necessary technology requirements in Idaho clas srooms. Idaho teacher preparation prog ram evaluations include an assessment of the integration of relevant technology that covers the intention of the original ITCA. The ITCA should be removed as a requirement for teacher certification, however, out- of-state applicants and other applicants for interim certification may be reviewed by the hiring district for deficiencies in technology skills, on a case by case basis. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rule will confer a Benefit on K-12 Teachers, Administrators and Post Secondary Faculty. The original intention of the Idaho Technology Competency Assessment when it was written ten years ago was to ensure that Idaho educators were proficient with basic technology. All teach ers who were certificated prior to 2006 have passed this exam. In almost every case, new teachers entering the cl assroom are far more proficient in technology than as minimally required by the ITCA. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to require technology testing on a statewide basis. Technology competency will be assessed on a case by case basis and mandated only according to individual district requirements.

(3-20-04) ( ) c.The baseline for AYP will be set by the Board and shall identify the amount of growth (percentage IDAHO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATI ON Docket No. 08-0203-0702 Rules Governing Thoroughness Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 57 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8of students reaching proficiency) required for each intermediate period. (3-20-04) 03. Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) Definitions . For purposes of calculating and reporting adequate yearly progress, the following definitions shall be applied. (3-20-04) a.Full Academic Year (contin uous enrollment). (3-20-04) i. A student who is enrolled continuously in the same public school from the end of the first eight (8) weeks or fifty-six (56) calendar days of the school year through the end of the state approved spring testing administration period, not including the make-up portion of the test window, will be included in the calculation to determine if the school achieved AYP. A student is continuously enrolled if he/she has not transferred or dropped-out of the public school. Students who are serving suspensions ar e still considered to be enrolled students. Students who are expelled but return to another school in the same district are considered continuously enrolled to determine the district AYP. (4-6-05)( ) ii. A student who is enrolled continuously in the school district from the first eight (8) weeks or fifty- six (56) calendar days of the school year through the end of the state approved spring testing administration period, not including the make-up portion of the test window, will be included when determining if the school district has achieved AYP. (4-6-05)( ) iii. A student who is enrolled continuously in a public school within Idaho from the end of the first eight (8) weeks or fifty-six (56) calendar days of the school year through the end of the state approved spring testing administration period, not including the make-up portion of the test window, will be included when determining if the state has achieved AYP. (4-6-05)( ) b.Participation Rate. (3-20-04) i. Failure to include percent (95%) of all students and ninety-five percent (95%) of students in designated subgroups automatically identifies the school as not having achieved AYP. The ninety-five percent (95%) determination is made by dividing the number of students assessed on the Spring ISAT by the number of students reported on the class roster file for the Spring ISAT. (3-20-04) (1) If a school district does not meet the ninety-five percent (95%) participatio n target for the current year, the participation rate can be calculated by the most current three (3) year aver age of participation. (4-6-05) (2) Students who are absent for the entire state-ap proved testing window because of a significant medical emergency are exempt from taking the ISAT if such circumstances prohibit them from participating. (4-6-05) ii. For groups of ten (10) or more students, abse nces for the state assessment may not exceed five percent (5%) of the current en rollment or two (2) students, whichever is greater. Groups of less than ten (10) students will not have a participation determination. (3-20-04) c.Schools. (3-20-04) i. An elementary school includes a grade configur ation of grades Kindergarten (K) through six (6) inclusive, or any combination thereof. (3-20-04) ii. A middle school is a school that does not meet the definition of an elementary school and contains grade eight (8) but does not contain grade twelve (12). (4-6-05) iii. A high school is any school that contains grade twelve (12). (3-20-04) iv. The accountability of public schools without grades assessed by this system (i.e., K-2 schools) will be based on the third grade test scores of the student s who previously attended that feeder school. (3-20-04) d.Subgroups. Scores on the ISAT must be disaggregated and reported by the following subgroups:IDAHO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATI ON Docket No. 08-0203-0702 Rules Governing Thoroughness Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 58 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8(3-20-04) i.

Economically disadvantaged - identified through the free and reduced lunch program. (3-20-04)iii. Students with disabilities - individuals who are eligible to receive special education services through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). (3-20-04) iv. Limited English Proficient - individuals who score in the low range on the state-approved language proficiency test and meet one of the following criteria: (4-6-05) (1) Individuals whose native language is a language other than English; or (4-6-05)(2) Individuals who come from environments where a language other than English is dominant; or (4-6-05) (3) Individuals who are American Indian and Alaska n natives and who come from environments where a language other than English has had a significant impact on their level of English language proficiency, and who, by reason thereof, have sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language to deny such individuals the opportunity to l earn successfully in classrooms, where th e language of instruction is English. (4-6-05) e.Graduation Rate. The State Board of Education will establish a target for graduation. All high schools must maintain or make progress toward the target each year. The graduation rate will be disaggregated by the subpopulations listed in Subsection 112.03.d. in the event the \"safe harbor\" is invoked by the school/district. By 2014, the schools/districts must meet the target. (3-20-04) f.Additional Academic Indicator. The State Board of Education will establish a target for an additional academic indicator. All elementary and middle schools must maintain or make progress toward the additional academic indicator target each year. The additional academic indicator target will be disaggregated by the subpopulations listed in Subsection 112.03.d. in the event the \"safe harbor\" is invoked by the school/district. By 2014, the schools/districts must meet the target. (3-20-04) 113. REWARDS. 01. Distinguished Schools . A school may be recognized as a \"Distinguished School\" if it is in the top five percent (5%) of schools exceeding the Idaho Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) intermediate targets listed in Subsection 112.02, of this rule, and if it has significantly reduced the gaps between subgroups listed in Subsection 112.03.d. of this rule. (3-30-07) 02. Additional Yearly Growth (AYG) Award . A school demonstrating improved proficiency levels of subpopulations or in the aggregate by greater than ten percent (10%) shall be considered to have achieved AYG. Such school must have achieved Adequate Yearly Progr ess (AYP) to be eligible for this award. (3-30-07) 03. Determination by State Department of Education .

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The section in this chapter that contains the legal authority for rulemaking was updated by deleting obsolete citations to Idaho Code and adding the correct citations. One out dated citation to Idaho Code that was deleted is now administered by the Department of Environmental Quality. Another citation that was deleted referred to obsolete sections of statute related to radiation control that were deleted by Senate Bill 1148 (2007). The legal authority section was also missing the correct citations that state that rulemaking authority for this chapter rests with the Board of Health and Welfare and the Director of the Department; these citations were added. In addition, the rest of the sections at the beginning of the chapter required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) were either updated to meet the Department's plai n language standard or added because they are missing. Addition of the missing \"required sections\" brings the rule chapter into compliance with the APA. Finally, to facilitate the updating of definitions in the future, the chapter's lengthy \"Definitions\" section was split into four smaller sections. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.

During any calendar quarter the dose to the whole bo dy from radiation machines in the registrant's possession does not exceed three (3) rem; and (7-1-98) ii. The dose to the whole body, when added to the accumulated occupational dose to the whole body, does not exceed five (5) (N-18) rem where \"N\" equals the i ndividual's age in years at hi s last birthday; and (7-1-98) iii. The registrant has determined the individual's accumulated occupational dose to the whole body on a clear and legible record containing all the information required pursuant to Subsection 140.01.a. and has otherwise complied with the requirements of Subsection 110.02 as used in Subsection 110.01.b. \"Dose to the whole body\" includes any dose to the whole body, gonads, active blood-forming organs, head and trunk, or lens of the eye. (7-1-98) c.For determining the doses specified in Section 110 a dose from x-rays or gamma rays up to ten (10) MeV can be assumed to be equivalent to the exposure measur ed by a properly calibrated ap propriate instrument in air at or near the body surface in the region of the highest dose rate. (7-1-98) d.No registrant can change the method observed by him of determining calendar quarter for purposes of these rules except at the beginning of a calendar year from Subsection 002.14 010.13. (7-1-98)( (7-1-98) a.Each registrant shall require any individual, prior to first entry of the individual into the registrant's restricted area during each employment or work assignment under such circumstances that the individual will receive or is likely to receive in any period of one (1) calendar quarter an occupational dose in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the applicable standards speci fied in Subsections 110.01 and 110.04.a., to disclose in a written, signed statement: (7-1-98) i. That the individual had no prior occupational do se during the current calendar quarter; or (7-1-98) ii. The nature and amount of any occupational dose which the individual may have received during the specifically identified curr ent calendar quarter, from radiation machines possessed or controlled by the other persons, and each registrant shall maintain records of such statements until the Agency authorizes disposition. (7-1-98) b.Before permitting any individual in a restricted area to receive exposure to radiation in excess of the limits specified in Subsection 11 0.01, each registrant must: (7-1-98) i. Obtain a signed certificate on a clear and legible record containing all the information required, showing each period of time after the individual attained th e age of eighteen (18) in wh ich the individual received an occupational dose of radiation (copies of certificates can be obtained from the Radiation Control Agency); and (7-1-98) ii. Calculate, on a clear and legible record contai ning all the information required pursuant to Subsection 140.01.a., the previously accu mulated occupational dose received by the individual and the additional dose allowed for that individual under Subsection 110.01.b. (7-1-98) iii. In the preparation of a clear and visible record containing all the information required, make a reasonable effort to obtain reports of the individual's previously accumulated occupational dose. For each period for which the registrant obtains such report, he must use the do se shown in the report. In any case where a registrant is unable to obtain reports of the individual's occupational dos e for a previous complete calendar quarter, it must be assumed that the individual has received the occupationa l dose specified in the follo wing applicable columns:DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0227-0701 Idaho Radiation Control Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 77 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8(7-1-98) iv. The registrant shall retain and preserve all records used until the agency authorizes their disposition. If calculation of the individual's accumulated occupational dose for all periods prior to January 1, 1961, yields a result higher than the applicable accumulated dose va lue for the individual as of that date, as specified in Subsection 110.01.b., the exces s can be disregarded. (7-1-98) 03. Exposure of Minors . Registrants must not possess, use or transfer radiation machines in such a manner as to cause any individual within a restricted area, who is under eighteen (18) years of age, to receive in any period of one (1) calendar quarter from all sources of radiation in such licensee's or registrant's possession a dose in excess of ten percent (10%) of the limits specified in the table in Subsection 110.01.a. For determining the doses specified in Subsection 110.04.a., a dose from x-rays or gamma rays up to ten (10) MeV can be assumed to be equivalent to the exposure measured by a properly calibrate d appropriate instrument in air at or near the body surface in the region of the highest dose rate. (7-1-98) 04. Permissible Levels of Radiation from External Sources in Unrestricted Areas . (7-1-98) a.Except as authorized by the Radiation Control Ag ency pursuant to Subsection 110.04.c., licensees or registrants must not possess, use, or transfer radiation machines in such a manner as to create in any unrestricted area from such sources of radiation in his possession: (7-1-98) i. Radiation levels which, if an individual were continuously present in the area, could result in his receiving a dose in excess of two (2) millirem in any one (1) hour; or (7-1-98) ii. Radiation levels which, if an individual were continuously present in the area, could result in his receiving a dose in excess of one hundred (100) millirem in any seven (7) consecutive days. (7-1-98) b.It is the intent of Subsection 110.04 to limit radiation levels so that it is unlikely that individuals in unrestricted areas would receive a dose to the whole body in excess of five-tenths (0.5) rem in any one (1) year. If in specific instances, it is determined by the Radiation Control Agency that this intent is not being met, the Radiation Control Agency can, pursuant to under Section 01 09 of these rules impose such additional requirements on the licensee or registrant as necessary. (7-1-98)( ) c.Any person can apply to the Radiation Control Agency for proposed limits upon levels of radiation in unrestricted areas in excess of those specified in Subsection 110.04.a. resulting from the applicant's possession or use of radiation machines. Such applications must include information as to anticipated average radiation levels and anticipated occupancy times for each unrestricted area involved. The Radiation Control Agency will approve the proposed limits if the applicant demonstrates to the satis faction of the Radiation Control Agency that the proposed limits are not likely to cause any individual to receive a dose to the whole body in any period of one (1) calendar year in excess of five-tenths (0.5) rem.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant the Social Security Act; and Section 405(c)(1) of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA), P.L. 109-432. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 15, 2007. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Department is making two changes to this chapter of rule as listed below: 1. Because of recent changes made to Section 1902 of the Social Security Act, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reversed a final policy ruling made in July of 2006. It will now deem a baby eligible for Medicaid coverage for his first year of life when the baby was born to a mother covered by emergency Medicaid. This policy change means that all babies born in the United States, whose deliveries are covered by Medicaid, receive the same coverage (i.e., Medicaid for one full year after birth). 2. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) provided clarification to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) through an amendment to the Social Security Act. Based on this clarification, two additional categories of people who are exempt from the Medicai d requirement to prove their U. S. citizenship and identity will be added to these rules. These groups are Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) recipients and foster care children receiving child welfare services under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. They are considered exempt because either the Department or the Social Security Administration verifies citizenship and identity before they issue benefits. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is being done to meet federal regulations. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a non-technical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: During the 2007 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 1170 was passed. This Bill updated Medicaid eligibility criteria in Sections 56-1302 and 56-1303, Idaho Code.

This rulemaking aligns the eligibility requirements regarding excluded resources with the changes in statute. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is being done to meet federal regulations time lines and confer a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased. N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 56-202(b), 56-203(g), 56-203(i), and 56-250 through 56-257, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than Wednesday, August 15, 2007. The hearing sites will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the h earing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The current process used to determine a Medicaid participant's eligibility for nursing facility care results in delays for nursing facilities and participants. In the current process, after conducting a standard functional assessment on a participant, a nursing facility submits that person's assessment data in the form of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) to the Department. Department nurses then convert this da ta to a standardized score using the Department's Uniform Assessment Instrument (UAI). This score is used to determ ine if a participant needs the level of care provided by a nursing facility. Rule changes are needed to e liminate this extra \"conversion\" step so that a participant's assessment data can be used directly to determine his eligibility for nursing facility care. This will make the process simpler and more efficient, use less staff time, and result in more rapid eligibility determination while maintaining the same degree of accuracy. The rules that require UAI scoring be used to determine whether or not a participant needs nursing facility level of care are being moved from the Nursing Facility section of the rules to the Aged or Disabled (A&D) Waiver section. This rule change will allow Medicaid to accept the MDS scores submitted by nursing facilities as sufficient to determine that a participant needs nursing facility level of care. Medicaid will no longer convert MDS scores to UAI scores. This way, MDS scores will be used directly to determine medical eligibility for nursing facility care. UAI scoring will still be used to determine eligibility for long-term care services covered under the A&D Waiver since the assessment process used to produce the MDS is only applicable to the nursing facility setting. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate because it confers a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the state general fund related to this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because changes are being made to make the eligibility process easier for nursing facilities and more efficient for the Department . Informal discussions were held with the Idaho H ealth Care Association, the proposed changes were welcomed.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0703 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Temporary and Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 103 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Susan Scheuerer at (208) 287-1156.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 39-3308, 39-3508, and 56-202(b), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than Wednesday, August 15, 2007. The hearing sites will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the h earing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In the \"Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits\" chapter (IDAPA 16 .03.10), a rule change is currently being proposed that will simplify the process for determining eligibility for nursing facility care. Specifically, the requirement that functional assessment scores (also known as the Minimum Data Set - MDS) submitted by nursing facilities be converted by Medicaid using its own scoring system (known as the Uniform Assessment Instrument - UAI) is being removed. Medicaid will accept the MDS scores submitted by nursing facilities as sufficient to determine that a participant needs nursing facility level of care. Medicaid will no longer convert MDS scores to UAI scores. This way, MDS scores will be used directly to determine medical eligibility for nursing facility care. This change will make the process more efficient, use less staff time, and result in more rapid eligibility determination while maintaining the same degree of accuracy. Two rule changes are needed in this chapter to make it co nsistent with the changes being proposed in the \"Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits\" chapter. 1. The term \"nursing facilities\" is being removed from the definition of \"Supported Living Services Provider\" since the Uniform Assessment Instrument (UAI) will no longer be used for nursing facility residents. The UAI will continue to be used for the rest of the supported living services providers listed in the definition. 2. The reference to the use of the UAI for nursing facil ity resident reassessments is also being removed since the MDS will be able to be used directly as a re sult of the changes in the \"Medicaid's Enhanced Plan Benefits\" chapter. In addition, the sections at the begi nning of the chapter required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) are being either updated or added where missing, to br ing the rule chapter into compliance with the APA. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate because it confers a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fi scal year. There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the state general fund related to this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because changes are being made to make the eligibility process easier for nursing facilities and more efficient for the Department . Informal discussions took place with the Idaho Hea lth Care Association, the proposed changes were welcomed.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0323-0701 Uniform Assessments for State-Funded Clients Temporary and Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 112 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Susan Scheuerer at (208) 287-1156.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. This rulemaking updates citations to the federal regulations incorporated by refe rence as mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval of the state's Title V Operating Permit Program pursuant to 40 CFR Part 70 and fulfilling the requirements of Idaho's delega tion agreement with EPA under Sec tion 112(l) of the Clean Air Act. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: September 6, 2007 -- 4:00 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking is necessary to ensure th at the Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho are consistent with federal regulations. This proposed rule updates citations to federal regulations incorporated by reference at Sections 008 and 107 to include those revised as of July 1, 2007. Sections 200, 204, and 205 also include citations to federal regulations incorporated by reference in the state rules. DEQ proposes to revise Sections 200, 204, and 205 to eliminat e the need to annually revise the ef fective date of the Code of Federal Regulations in those sections. This rulemaking also deletes references to the clean unit and pollution control project provisions, which are expressly excluded from incorporation by reference into the state rules. These references, which are found at Subsections 107.03.a.i., 107.03.d., 204.01., and 205.01, are no longer necessary because EPA recently adopted a final rule eliminating the pollution control project and clean unit provisions from the federal regulations. Members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules as well as special interest groups, public officials, or members of the public who have an interest in the regulations of air emissions from sources in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language th e agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2007 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2008 legislative session if adop ted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning this rulemaking, contact Martin Bauer at (208) 373-0440 or martin.bauer@deq.idaho.gov.

Additional Requirements . The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department the following: (4-6-05) a.LAER. Except as otherwise provided in Section 204, the new major facility or major modification would be operated at the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) for the nonattainment regulated air pollutant, specifically: (4-6-05) i. A new major facility would meet the lowest ach ievable emission rate at each new emissions unit which emits the nonattainment regulated air pollutant; and (4-5-00) ii. A major modification would meet the lowest achie vable emission rate at each new or modified emissions unit which has a net emissions increase of the nonattainment regulated air pollutant. (4-5-00) b.Required offsets. Allowable emissions from the new major facility or major modification are offset by reductions in actual emissions from stationary sources, facilities, and/or mobile sources in the nonattainment area so as to represent reasonable further progress. All offsetting emission reductions must satisfy the requirements for emission reduction credits (Section 460) and provide for a net air quality benefit which satisfies the requirements of Section 208. If the offsets are provided by other stationary sources or facilities, a permit to construct shall not be issued for the new major facility or major modification until the offsetting reductions are made enforceable through the issuance of operating permits. The ne w major facility or major modification may not commence operation, and an operating permit for the new major facility or major modification shall not be effective before the date the offsetting reductions are achieved. (4-5-00) c.Compliance status. All other sources in the State owned or operated by the applicant, or by any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with such person, are in co mpliance with all applicable emission limitations and standards or subject to an enforceable compliance schedule. (5-1-94) d.Effect on visibility. The effect on visibility of any federal Class I area, Class I area designated by the Department, or integral vista of a mandatory Class I Federal Area, by the new major facility or major modification, is consistent with making reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal referred to in 40 CFR 51.300(a). The Department may take into account the cost s of compliance, the time n ecessary for compliance, the energy and non-air quality environmental impacts of complianc e and the useful life of the source.

This action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 15, 2007. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking, as announced in the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking published on May 2, 2007, is to revise IDAPA 58.01.04, \"Rules for Administration of Wastewater Treatment Facility Grants\" (Grant Rules), for consistency with the environmental review of IDAPA 58.01.12, \"Rules for Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans,\" (Loan Rules), Section 042. The two sets of rules have different requirements for environmental information document preparat ion and there is no need for the difference. The current structure of the Grant Rules requires that the grant app licant prepare an environmental information document of a uniform scope, regardless of the need for mitigation. Compliance with the Grant Rules adds a burden to both the applicant and DEQ when a proj ect qualifies for a categorical exclusion. An efficiency would be achieved by adopting the process used for wastewater facility loans, in which categorical exclusions are specifically allowed with a lower level of effort. Section 042 of the Loan Rules will be used as a model for the environmental review process for grants. In addition, this proposed rule contains revisions which were not included in the scope of the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking. The majority of these revisions were suggested or requested by members of the negotiating group during the meeting held on May 17, 2007. These revisions in clude the removal of references to construction and other obsolete language, revising definitions and rule text for consistency with other DEQ rules, and cleaning up outdated language. Cities, counties, districts and associations that own and operate wastewater treatment facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2007 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2008 legislative session if adopte d by the Board and approved by the Legislature. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: There is no federal law or regulation comparable to IDAPA 58.01.04, \"Rules for Administration of Wastewater Treatment Facility Grants.\" Therefore, the proposed rule does regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government but is not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code and IDAPA 04.11.01.812- 815. On May 2, 2007, the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 07-5, page 61, and a preliminary draft rule was made available for public review. One meeting was held on May 17, 2007. Several members of the public attended the meeting and the discussion resulted in revisions to the preliminary draft rule, some of which are beyond the scope of the May 2, 2007 Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking.

The action is authorized by Chapters 44 and 58, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, 40 CFR 271.21(e) and Section 39-4404, Idaho Code, require DEQ to adopt amendments to federal law as proposed under this docket. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 15, 2007. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). Idaho has historically adopted both required and optional fe deral regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idah o's authorization current. Adoption by reference also simplifies compliance for the regulated community. This proposed rule updates the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2007. In addition, this proposed rule includes technical corrections and clarifies that, for the purpose of 40 CFR 261.41(a), Regional Administrator means U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 Regional Administrator. Hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language th e agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2007 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2008 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning the proposed rulemaking, contact John Brueck, john.brueck@deq.idaho.gov, (208) 373-0458. Anyone can submit written comments by mail, fax or e-mail at the address below regarding this proposed rule. The Department will consider all written comments received by the undersigned on or before August 29, 2007.

This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code, and Chapter 21, Title 37, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 15, 2007. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule on January 4, 2006, and the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule on January 5, 2006. These are national primary drinki ng water regulations. As a state that has primacy for administering the Safe Drinking Water Act, Idaho must adopt these rules within two years of promulgation. 1. Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, 40 CFR Part 141, Subparts U and V : Requires public water systems that add a chemical disinfect ant to their water to conduct distribution system evaluations aimed at identifying sites within the syst em that are subject to high levels of disinfection byproducts (DBP). These byproducts are formed when chemical disinfectants su ch as chlorine combine with naturally occurring organic matter in the water. Based upon the results of distribution system evaluation, systems are required to prepare and implemen t a revised DBP monitoring plan that will ensure more equitable protection of cust omers from these contaminants. 2. Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, 40 CFR Part 141, Subpart W : Requires systems that use surface water to monitor their source water in or der to assess the occurrence of cryptosporidium, an important waterborne pathogen. Systems that find high levels of this organism in their source water will be required to provide additional treatment to ensure adequate removal and/or inactivation of cryptosporidium. As a primacy agency, DEQ must adopt state rules that ar e no less stringent than the federal regulations. Under direction from the Idaho Legislature, DEQ must adopt stat e rules that are no more stringent than the federal regulations. To ensure that Idaho's rules will be neither more nor less stringent than the federal regulations, the proposed rule incorporates by refere nce the necessary federal regulations. Drinking water system owners and operators, developers, consultants, engineers, cities, counties, industry, drinking water professional organizations, and the public at large may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. While not part of this rulemaking, DEQ is also seeking public comment on two guidance documents: \"Implementation Guidance for the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule\" and \"Implementation Guidance for the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection By products Rule.\" These documents provide assistance to public water system owners and operators in understanding and achieving compliance with the requirements of these rules and may be obtained at http://www.deq.idaho.gov/rules/drinking_water/58_0108_0701_proposed.cfm or by contacting Tom John at thomas.john@deq.idaho.gov or (208)373-0191. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out.

This action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 15, 2007. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking, as announced in the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking published on May 2, 2007, is to revise the conditions and qualifications for disadvantaged loans set out in IDAPA 58.01.20, Rules for Administration of Drinking Water Loan Program. An analysis of the drinking water loans made to date illustrates that the qualification for a disadvantaged loan may be too restrictive (the program has been in place for 9 years and only 2 disadvantaged loans have been entered into: Salmon and Castleford). The combination of how communities prove their median household income and the disadvantaged loan qualifications combine to provide difficult challenges for some communities. This rulemaking will include the following proposed revisions: 1. Remove one of the conditions for a disadvantaged lo an (median household income does not exceed 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household inco me) and change the second condition (reducing the percentage required for user fees from 2% to 1\u00bd %). The remaining disadvantaged loan qualification condition would then be that user fees would exceed 1\u00bd% of median household income. 2. Allow drinking water systems to make use of approved third party income surveys to verify the community's median household income. Currently communities must use census data, but most communities are not reported at the census level ( out of 756 community water systems only 143 are cities). In addition, this proposed rule contains revisions which were not included in the scope of the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking. The majority of these revisions were suggested or requested by members of the negotiating group during the meeting held on May 17, 2007. These revisions include the removal of obsolete language, revising definitions and rule text for consistency with other DEQ rules, and cleaning up outdated language. Citizens in economically disadvantaged communities, and cities, counties, districts and associations that own and operate public drinking water systems may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2007 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2008 legislative session if adopte d by the Board and approved by the Legislature.

(RESERVED).Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 203 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8IDAPA 58 - DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 58.01.22 - RULES FOR ADMINIST RATION OF PLANNING GRANTS FOR PUBLIC DRINKING WATER FACILITIES DOCKET NO. 58-0122-0701 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - PROPOSED RULE AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5221(1), Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has proposed rulemaking. This action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 15, 2007. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking, as announced in the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking published on May 2, 2007, is to revise IDAPA 58.01.22, \"Rules for Administration of Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities\" (Grant Rules), for consistency with the environmental review section (042) of IDAPA 58.01.20, \"Rules for Administration of Drinking Water Loan Program\" (Loan Rules). The two sets of rules have different requirements for environmental informatio n document preparation and there is no need for the difference. The current structure of the Grant Rules requ ires that the grant applican t prepare an environmental information document of a uniform scope, regardless of the need for mitigation. Compliance with the Grant Rules adds a burden to both the applicant and DEQ when a project qualifies fo r a categorical exclus ion. An efficiency would be achieved by adopting the process used for drinki ng water loans, in which categorical exclusions are specifically allowed with a lower level of effort. Section 042 of the Loan Rules will be used as a model for the environmental review process for grants. In addition, this proposed rule contains revisions which were not included in the scope of the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking. The majority of these revisions were suggested or requested by members of the negotiating group during the meeting held on May 17, 2007. These revisions in clude the removal of references to construction and other obsolete language, revising definitions and rule text for consistency with other DEQ rules, and cleaning up outdated language. Cities, counties, districts and associations that own and operate public drinking water systems may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2007 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2008 legislative session if adop ted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: There is no federal law or regulation comparable to IDAPA 58.01.22, \"Rules for Administration of Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities.\" Therefore, the proposed rule does regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government but is not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5220 and IDAPA 04.11.01.812- 815. On May 2, 2007, the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 07-5, page 66, and a preliminary draft rule was made available for public review. One meeting was held on May 17, 2007. Several members of the public attended the meeting and the discussion resulted in revisions to the preliminary draft rule, some of which are beyond the scope of the May 2, 2007 Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0122-0701 Administration of Planning Grants for Pu blic Drinking Water Facilities Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 204 August 1, 2007 - Vol. 07-8ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning this rulemaking, contact Tim Wendland at tim.wendland@deq.idaho.gov, (208)373-0439.
