Functional Medicine Consultation ONLINE Functional medicine is an integrated, science-based approach to health care that uses advanced laboratory testing in order to analyze the genetic predispositions which influence our wellness. Nutritional balance plays a key role within this framework for optimal living as it can help prevent chronic disease and the aging process while also promoting youthfulness through various holistic practices including detox programs with vital supplements. Our initial telemedicine functional medicine consultation will be held in an online video conference, where a Physician will virtually consult with you, and develop a custom functional medicine protocol and treatment plan after your initial Advanced Laboratory Testing results are in. Please ensure that you have your laptop or computer camera enabled so that the Physician can see and treat you. "}
