Relevant literatures of recent years were searched from commonly employed scientific databases on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Most of the plants displaying considerable immunomodulation activity are summarized along with their possible mechanisms. These discussions shall hopefully elicit the attention of researchers and encourage further studies on these plant-based immunomodulation products as potential therapy for the management of infectious diseases, including viral ones such as COVID-19. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel strain of coronavirus first isolated from humans in December 2019 in Wuhan city, China. It is highly contagious and produces a disease known as COVID-19, which has pneumonia-like symptoms and has resulted in a pandemic. COVID-19 can infect all age groups, showing relatively severe symptoms in people over 60 years of age ( [1](#B1)) and currently no medications are approved for its therapy. For a disease without treatment, preventive medicines are prescribed and immunomodulators with antivirals can serve the purpose. To control such infections, vaccination is considered to be an effective method; however, it is known to prevent the incidence of acute respiratory infections in healthy individuals only to a certain extent ( [2](#B2)). As seen in all viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, the virus-specific T cells responsible for cell-mediated immunity and B lymphocytes for humoral immunity, play important roles in the adaptive immune response by the body. There is an increase in neutrophils, interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein and a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes ( [3](#B3)). The activation of T lymphocytes plays a role in exacerbation of inflammatory responses, whereas the B lymphocytes help in producing specific neutralizing antibodies for the virus ( [4](#B4), [5](#B5)). Herbal products are recognized as complementary approach to modern medication; consequently, immunomodulation agents from natural sources have proven to be safe and effective alternatives ( [6](#B6), [7](#B7)). Immunomodulators stimulate the body's natural defense against pathogens including viruses, thereby maintaining immune-system homeostasis and could be an effective way to prevent viral infections. Malfunctions or imbalances in the immune system are associated with a range of chronic diseases, including allergies, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune disorders, viral infections, and many others. Carotenoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, acid derivatives) and polysaccharides are important phytocompounds with known chemical structures and considerable immunomodulating activities ( [8](#B8)). Among other popular therapeutic approaches, immunotherapy has been utilized indirectly for the treatment of cancer. Recently, immunotherapy demonstrated positive responses in cancer treatment with clinical successes by blocking antibodies at two immune checkpoints, namely, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and planned cell death protein 1, in addition to chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells ( [9](#B9)). Globally, around 180 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus and owing to the quasispecies nature of the virus, the development of effective vaccination has long been a challenging task ( [10](#B10)). Cerebral malaria (CM), often occurs in immunocompromised individuals along with the failure of antimalaria treatment. Plant-based natural products such as curcumin have demonstrated promising immunomodulation activity and can be used as an adjunctive therapy for CM ( [11](#B11)). Dengue is another mosquito-borne viral disease causing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to endothelial activation and vascular leakage. Antioxidants and natural immunomodulating agents from plant sources have demonstrated promising results in the treatment of a number of viral infections ( [12](#B12)). Dietary polysaccharides are the prebiotics which are known to affect gut microbial ecology. There has been a direct correlation between nutrients present in the diet and the immune function ( [13](#B13)). A number of micronutrients, macronutrients and the gut microbiome mediate the immunological effects of body. The microbial transformation of dietary components to its metabolites has a considerable effect on the physiological and immunological processes. There is a close relationship between the bacterial metabolism and the efficacy of phytochemicals as it may increase or decrease upon metabolism ( [14](#B14)). Following the advancements made in the field of microbial ecology, immunology and metabolomics, the impact of gut microbiota on host nutrition, immune modulation, resistance to pathogens, intestinal epithelial development and activity and energy metabolism has been recognized ( [15](#B15)). Plant-based nutritional foods are known to improve the population of beneficial bacteria present in intestines which help and constitute up to 85% of the immune system ( [16](#B16)). Spices used in the food and their secondary metabolites ( [17](#B17)) also showed the immunostimulation potential and it was observed that the COVID-19 cases were more prevalent in countries with lesser gram spice supply per capita per day ( [18](#B18)). Non-digestible nutrients that selectively promote the growth of normal intestinal bacterial flora are known to have beneficial effects on the large intestinal lining. After being hydrolyzed by gut bacteria, these nutrients may either bind to epithelia or get absorbed in the systemic circulation to stimulate the immune system ( [19](#B19), [20](#B20)). Among ampligen, and CL246), a total of 738 factors exhibited significant antiviral activity and were recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic use in early-stage infections of several species of viruses ( [21](#B21)). The aim of this review was to summarize the most important medicinal plants which displayed good immunomodulation activity from the recently published literature. It also covers the possible mechanism of immunomodulation for these plants and the role of natural products in the treatment and management of viral infections. Recently published articles from commonly used search engines such as Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Research, etc. which were related to the scope of the review were included. A good number of reviews are present discussing various plants and their bioactive constituents demonstrating immunomodulation and antiviral activities, however, an updated review focusing on the immunomodulation activities of important medicinal plants and their isolated molecules along with their mechanisms is still warranted. Immune System Responses to Viral Infection Infection by pathogenic viruses causes a number of infectious diseases, such as influenza, smallpox, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, measles, and newly identified COVID-19 ( [22](#B22)). The body's defense system recognizes the infecting organisms such as viruses and bacteria as foreign particles through innate or adaptive immunity systems. In case of innate immunity, foreign microbes are identified by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) situated on the surface of innate immune cells. Subsequently, the invading organisms are destroyed by certain defense processes, such as cytotoxin generation by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis ( [23](#B23), [24](#B24)). In adaptive immunity, microorganisms are recognized by T and B lymphocytes through cell surface-antigen-specific receptors (T cell and B cell receptors) and the invaders are eliminated through cytotoxic responses (e.g., neutrophils, CD45+ lymphocytes, CD8+ T cell, and antibody production ( [23](#B23), [25](#B25)). However, pathogenic microbes often succeed in infecting the biological system despite the strong defense mechanisms even in immunocompetent individuals because of a number of immune-evasion tactics, including surpassing recognition by immune cells and immobilizing immune responses ( [26](#B26)- [28](#B28)). Owing to the high sequence variability of viruses, they can avoid immune responses via the variation and interruption of antigen generation from virus-infected cells ( [29](#B29), [30](#B30)). Viruses can interfere with the antiviral signaling of the immune system by altering genetic materials, reducing cytokine generation ( [31](#B31)), and hindering the expression of PRRs and their adapter ( [32](#B32)). Viruses can also affect the immune response by reducing the cytotoxic function of T cells ( [33](#B33)) and reducing NKG2D and MHC-1 molecules, thereby suppressing immune stimulation ( [34](#B34), [35](#B35)). For example, dengue and West Nile viruses escape immune response through the blockage of IFN-/IFN- receptors ( [36](#B36)), and influenza viruses achieve gene mutations involved in antigen binding through \"antigen drift\" ( [37](#B37)). In another way of escaping immune responses, virus particles enter a host cell in the dormant state and subsequently are reactivated when the cell immunity weakens. Consequently, the detection of viruses becomes difficult because the infected cells start upregulating the expression of latency-related genes rather than lytic viral genes ( [38](#B38)). These viruses can be best exemplified by human papillomavirus (HPV), which can adopt a dormant state and after assuming dormancy, the migrating HIV-infected cells can be reactivated by differential responses to drugs ( [39](#B39), [40](#B40)). These viruses can create a favorable environment for infection through alteration of various metabolic processes of host cells; such as enhanced fatty acid synthesis, change in aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis ( [41](#B41), [42](#B42)). Additionally, enhanced lactic acid creates an acidic microenvironment that helps in virus pathogenesis as the fusion of an enveloped virus to the host cell membrane occurs more effectively at acidic pH ( [25](#B25), [43](#B43)). For instance, Zika virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HIV induce the dysregulation of glycolytic processes through enhanced glucose influx, lactic acid production, and GLUT1 expression in host cells ( [44](#B44)). The short-term exposure of Ebola virus to an acidic environment may result in increased fusion rate to the host cell membrane ( [45](#B45)). Mechanism for Innate Antiviral Immunity Innate immunity are the non-specific immunity which includes expression of factors resulting into inhibition of virus particles and slowing down the infections in a rapid manner without adaptation or generation of long-lasting memory for protection. The innate antiviral responses are critical in order to mobilize the protective immunity. Upon viral infection, the innate immunity cells get activated mainly through the germline-coded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are present either on the cellular surfaces or within distinct intracellular compartments. The PRRs include the family of the retinoic receptors (NLRs) ( [46](#B46)). These receptors are mainly triggered by the exposure of viral nucleic acids and proteins. These PRRs present in a wide array of cellular components sense the presence of viral antigen and quickly respond to the viral infection and replication of these viruses in the cellular compartments. Activation of family of TLRs including TLR-3, 7, 8 and 9 mediates the type-I interferons (IFN-Is) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokines are responsible for the production of a number of inflammatory mediators causing inflammation, fever and pain; whereas, the IFN-Is are the important mediators of antiviral immunity and are responsible for the antiviral activities ( [47](#B47)). Similarly, RLRs sense and detect the viral RNA in the cytosol resulting into the induction of IFN-Is. The RLRs can generally differentiate between the viral RNA and the host RNA owing to the distinct features present in the viral RNA ( [48](#B48)). The RLRs can detect the double-stranded viral RNA and activate NF-B and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) through the adaptive protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), a protein that resides in the mitochondrial membrane and orchestrates host antiviral innate immune responses to the RNA-virus infection ( [49](#B49)). Another important mechanism by which the host defense system neutralizes and kills the pathogens is via expression of natural antibodies (NAbs), which are innate-like serum antibodies ( [50](#B50)). These NAbs play important role in early immune response against the viral infections and are crucial part of the host defense. The activation of PRRs initiates signal transduction via a series of adaptor proteins leading to the expression of a number of transcription factors such as NF-B, IRF-3, IRF-7 and several kinases; consequently the production of antiviral IFN-Is. However, certain viruses have evolved in such a way that they can block the innate immune-signaling and hinder the antiviral responses by host. They escape detection by PRRs, can block the activation of adaptor proteins and kinases and can disrupt the transcription factors; thereby successfully invade the host cells ( [51](#B51)). Various components of innate immunity include macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells. These cells can identify and kill the viral pathogens by phagocytosis, cleavage and by cytotoxic activity ( [52](#B52)). Treatment of Viral Diseases Using Natural Immunomodulators The treatment of infectious diseases involves either directly killing the infecting microbes or therapeutically modulating the body's immune responses to eradicate pathogenic organisms from the body without causing injury to the host cells. The immunity to microbial attacks might involve nonspecific responses (innate immunity) to common antigens or acquired responses (adaptive immunity) to specific microbes ( [53](#B53), [54](#B54)). Multiple potential targets have been identified to modulate the immune responses of body for the microbial attacks. Considering that viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and entirely dependent on the host, direct therapy using pharmaceuticals for viral infection is difficult ( [55](#B55)). The development of vaccine against a particular viral infection is a slow and tedious process and targeting immune responses becomes important for the intervention of these diseases ( [56](#B56)). In recent years, immunotherapy has been developed as a promising therapy in form of complementary treatment for the diseases caused by viral infections ( [56](#B56)- [59](#B59)). Natural products are known to primarily stimulate the nonspecific immune responses (innate immunity), in which the mediators of immune system including cytokines, macrophages, neutrophils, acute-phase ( [60](#B60)). Pathogens express different factors known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are recognized by the host to perceive the presence of pathogens. PAMPs are recognized by host sensors using PRRs triggering a sequence of immune reactions through the generation of type-1 IFNs, cytokines, and [60](#B60)). TLR-3, -7,- 8, and -9 are extremely important in sensing viral infections as they transduce signals to the system, which then activates antiviral processes. Agents that nonspecifically stimulate TLR-mediated responses may be potential antiviral remedies ( [60](#B60)). In nonspecific immunity, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) roles in cytokine antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antigen presentation, processing and phagocytosis. The stimulation of na\u00efve B cells and na\u00efve T cells occurs through dendritic cells. Natural killer cells are upregulated, leading to the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis [61](#B61)- [63](#B63)) Possible role of natural immunomodulators for prevention and treatment of viral infections. Natural Products as Immunomodulators Normally, the body's defense system maintains homeostasis; however, several endogenous or exogenous factors can alter its efficiency and effectiveness. Molecules from synthetic, natural, or biological origins can modify (suppress or stimulate) either the innate or adaptive component of immunity and are known as immunomodulators ( [63](#B63)). Immunomodulators which improve the immune responses against infections either by activating or inducing the immune-system components are regarded as immunostimulants ( [64](#B64)). In this review, the term immunomodulator refers to an immunostimulant. Some synthetic compounds and monoclonal antibodies are available as immunomodulators, but their use has been associated with a number of limitations, including side effects. For example, the use of recombinant cytokines as immunostimulants is associated with GI distress ( [63](#B63), [65](#B65)). Thus, safe and effective agents are still required; indeed a significant amount of research has been conducted to identify natural products as immunomodulators. Immunomodulators from wide varieties of plants, their extracts, active plant ingredients and plant products have been investigated ( [66](#B66)). Recently, plants containing polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids in the form of fruit juice, extract, or isolated active constituents have been extensively studied for several beneficial effects, including their capability to modify the body's defense system. Flavonoids are primarily antioxidant and exhibit inhibitory properties on inflammatory cytokine generation ( [67](#B67)). Several plant products have been investigated previously for direct treatment or as prophylaxis for infectious diseases ( [68](#B68), [69](#B69)). Dietary supplements such as vitamins C, D and E are primarily antioxidants and are known to improve the immunity. The duration and severity of common cold has been shown to be reduced by a high dose of vitamin C and D supplements in patients ( [70](#B70), [71](#B71)). Vitamin C has been included in at least 20 clinical studies to evaluate its efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients ( [72](#B72)). Another ongoing trial is assessing the efficacy of vitamin A, B, C, D and E supplements on the improvement and mortality in COVID-19 patients ( [73](#B73)). Vitamin E supplementation was found to improve cellular and humoral immunity and provides protection against infections ( [74](#B74)); although, the degree of resistance is unclear. A clinical trial on elderly subjects revealed that long-term supplementation of vitamin E enhanced the resistance to mild respiratory viral infections, such as common cold ( [75](#B75)). A large number of phytopharmaceuticals have been investigated for their beneficial effects in several diseases and many of them exerted significant immunomodulation properties. For example, resveratrol, an active constituent from grapevine, red wine, and peanuts, was found to show immunomodulation activity primarily through the inhibition constituent from tea, reportedly exhibited immunomodulation activity primarily by blocking NF-kB activation. It also down-regulated nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is dependent on The squeezed sap of Echinacea purpurea showed nonspecific immunomodulation for use against mild to moderate respiratory infections, such as the common cold ( [70](#B70)). Alkylamides are the principal active constituents, which act upon stimulation by the phagocytosis of macrophages and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine release such as TNF-. It also increases circulating leukocytes, stimulates NK cells and possesses antiviral activity. Polysaccharide constituents were found to ameliorate the disease progress in mice infected with influenza ( [54](#B54)) and were reported to improve the efficacy of influenza vaccine in immunosuppressed mice by activating the dendritic cells ( [76](#B76)). Ginsenoside, the active component of ginseng, exhibited significant immunostimulant activity and was successfully used as an adjuvant with influenza vaccine ( [54](#B54), [77](#B77)). Many of these phytochemicals have shown moderate to good immunomodulating activities in different ways in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Although, the results have been encouraging and favoring the use of these natural products as immunomodulators, high level systematic clinical studies are still warranted to establish their safety and efficacy. The structures of few important plant bioactive constituents exhibiting immunomodulation activity along with their sources are shown in [Figure 2](#f2). Figure 2 Chemical structure of selected natural bioactive compounds exhibiting immunomodulation activity, their major sources and mechanism of immunomodulation. Medicinal Plants Exhibiting Immunomodulation Activity The immunomodulating properties of medicinal plants have been studied much extensively during recent years due to the growing awareness on immune system modulation strategy to combat infectious diseases specifically the viral infections. A number of plants are already in use in folklore medicine for the treatment and prevention of viral infections either by directly affecting the pathogen or by stimulating the defense mechanism of human body in many ways. It is believed that the terpenoids present in these medicinal plants have promising efficacies in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 replications. Also, the alkaloidal structures such as lycorine, homoharringtonine and emetine have anti-coronaviral activities. Other baicalin, lguesterin, cryptotanshinone, silvestrol and sotetsuflavone showed inhibition viral replication enzymes inhibiting their growth ( [78](#B78)). In this section, most important medicinal plants which have shown evidence based promising immunomodulation and antiviral activities in various in vitro and in vivo studies are summarized. In addition, other reported biological activities of the plant along with the mechanism by which they exert the immunomodulation activity are also discussed. [Figure 3](#f3) shows the mechanisms by which medicinal plants demonstrate the immunomodulation activity. Echinacea purpurea L. E. purpurea L. is one of the most medicinally recognized plants and its products are commercially sold worldwide as a general health promoter and for its preventive actions on cold and flu. It shows effective antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and antiproliferative activities. Root and above-ground parts extracts reportedly signal and stimulated immune responses by influencing macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and NK cells and showed antiviral activity. The chemical constituents responsible for the antiviral activity and activating the body's immune system include glycoproteins, soluble polysaccharides, derivatives, and alkylamides ( [79](#B79), [80](#B80)). Other studies also showed that the preparations from plant extracts are among the most popular and high-demanding herbal product in USA as well as in other parts of the world due to its remarkable immunostimulatory activity and benefits in respiratory infections such as sore throat, cough, and cold ( [8](#B8), [81](#B81), [82](#B82)). The oral administration of extract D. batatas Decne is extensively used in traditional and modern medicines and the tuber of the plant contains a number of active components, including dioscorin, diosgenin, mucopolysaccharides, batatasins, and glycoproteins, exhibiting immunomodulation Tuber protein and dioscorin displayed mucosal and systemic immunomodulation activity through TLR4-induced macrophage activation by stimulating signaling molecules such as NF-kB, JNK, p38, and ERK, as well as by as TNF- and IL-6 ( [8](#B8), extract inhibited and COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells [85](#B85)). Tuber by remarkably enhancing the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter activity [86](#B86), [87](#B87)). Artemisia annua L A. annua L. is a Chinese traditional medicine possessing artemisinin as the main active compound. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene trioxane lactone primarily used as an antimalarial drug acting by disrupting the function of parasite mitochondria and by modulating host immunity. Artemisinin and its derivatives increase immune reconstitution and promote T cell activity; and are helpful in refurbishing immune function ( [88](#B88)). In addition to antimalarial activity, it also showed beneficial effects in cancer treatment and inhibition of angiogenesis. Its tea infusion can be used for the treatment of malaria and HIV without any toxicity ( [89](#B89)). Different phenolic compounds present in the extract showed activity against HIV and autoimmune diseases ( [8](#B8), [88](#B88)) and was even found to be effective against the novel COVID-19 virus ( B are some phytocompounds identified in tea infusion responsible for its activity ( [89](#B89), [91](#B91)). Lithospermum erythrorhizon L. erythrorhizon (Gromwell), a Chinese traditional medicine used from ancient times to treat smallpox, measles, macular eruptions, eczema, burns, and carbucles, is extremely popular in China and Taiwan. This herb is well known for the treatment of abnormal skin conditions such as wounds, inflammation, and burns. Dextrose capsule with 1.5 g of root extract improved stratum corneum hydration in parallel with increased ceramides in the outermost layer of epidermis ( [92](#B92)). The primary active compounds isolated from root of the plant are Shikonin and derivatives, which are extensively studied primarily because of their remarkable antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities ( [93](#B93)). The components also exhibited such as antioxidant, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerosis and immunomodulation. Shikonin is reported to genes, including chemokines (CCL4 and CCL8), cytokines modulators (PTGS2 and NFATC3) and reduced the surface expression of a primary HIV-1 co-receptor, CCR5, which may lead to the development of potential anti-HIV agents ( [94](#B94)). Overall, the findings on the activities of Shikonin and derivatives at the cellular and molecular levels strongly indicated its capability to induce specific chemokines and chemotaxis in barbarum L. barbarum, characterized by bright orange red berries with yellow seeds, is rich in polysaccharides. Its glucosylated precursor, scopoletin, has carotenoids, flavonoids, and vitamins that are used as food supplements and therapeutic agents. Dietary polysaccharides can increase the ratio of probiotic bacteria, regulate the intestinal microenvironment such as decreasing the gut pH, and stimulating immunity such as macrophages or lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa. As a result, these polysaccharides are very helpful in fighting infections ( [97](#B97)). Other studies reported that polysaccharides of the plant exhibit immunomodulation and antioxidant properties along with other various pharmacological activities ( [98](#B98)). It activated local and systemic immune responses in H22 tumor-bearing mice, improved immune responses when used as an adjuvant with vaccines, and enhanced humoral immunity ( [99](#B99), [100](#B100)) Ganoderma lucidum G. white fungus also known as Reishi mushroom or Red Lingzhi and has been used mainly in China for a long time to promote good health. The antiaging effect of its extract is primarily due to its antioxidant and immunomodulation properties. It is also reported to have anti-breast cancer and anti-neurodegeneration properties ( [101](#B101)). Its polysaccharide, one of the most studied components, has been reported as an effective immunomodulator and potential inhibitor of tumor growth ( [102](#B102)). The immunomodulation effects of this polysaccharide are broad spectrum and regulate the functions of the mononuclear phagocyte system, antigen-presenting cells, and cellular and humoral immunities ( [103](#B103)). The antitumor activities of G. lucidum are also believed to be due to immunomodulation processes ( [104](#B104)). Approximately 400 bioactive sterols, triterpenoids, steroids, proteins and, fatty acids have been identified. Formulations containing G. lucidum are approved by the Chinese FDA for the treatment of a large number of health-related problems including physical weakness, chronic hepatitis, chronic bronchitis, coronary heart disease, and anemia. The polysaccharide preparation is used for its antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulation, and hypoglycemic activities ( [105](#B105)). Eriobotrya japonica E. japonica Lindl. is known as Loquat and used in Chinese folk medicine. The reported phytonutritional composition of its leaf and flower extracts is rich in phenolic and triterpenoid compounds, whereas the kernel is rich in proteins, minerals, starch, and tannins. It is cultivated commercially for its fruit, which is loaded with important nutrients such as carotenoids, flavonoids, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, known to have several health benefits ( [106](#B106)). Loquat extract exhibited a wide range of medicinal properties, including those for the treatment of inflammation, diabetes, cancer, blood pressure regulation, immune-system improvement, viral infections, and has soothing effects on the respiratory system ( [107](#B107)). The anti-inflammatory effects of Loquat are primarily due to its capability reduce including iNOX, COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, an edible mushroom possessing significant medicinal values owing to a number of chemical and nutritional constituents, such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, phytosterols, -D-glucan, and saponins. The polysaccharide components of the fungus are thought to be the main active component responsible for its antihyperlipidemic, immunomodulator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities ( [109](#B109)). Its polysaccharide proved to be a promising adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, when integrated with tumor-specific antigen into animal bearing ovalbumin-expressing tumors ( [110](#B110)). Host immune activity was considerably boosted with specific stimulation of type 1 T-helper responses ( [110](#B110)). With respect to immunomodulation effects, water and ethanol extracts from medicinal mushroom including A. blazei exhibited opposite effects on NK cells. Water extract increased the cytotoxic activity of NK cells by stimulating the expression of cytotoxic proteins NKG2D cell surface receptors and ethanol extract reduced the expression of cytolytic and cell surface receptors ( [111](#B111), [112](#B112)). Dioscorea membranacea D. membranacea Pirre is a Thai traditional medicine and one of the components for herbal formulation used to treat cancer and AIDS. Its rhizome extract enhances lymphocyte proliferation and NK cell activity, whereas the main constituent Dioscorealide B reduces these factors at high concentration ( [113](#B113)). These findings indicated that the extract was an immunostimulant because of unknown compounds. It also exhibited antiallergy activity by suppressing -hexosaminidase, TNF-, and is shown to significantly induce interleukin (IL)-12 production in a dose-dependent manner to counter the effects of HCV infection. IL-12 consequently increased the IFN- production and decreased the IL-4 level in antigen primed CD4+ T cells. Berberine also stimulates the T helper lymphocytes ( [10](#B10), [115](#B115)). The fruit of the plant importance due to its antioxidant, obtained from the leaves of the plant C. splendens also exhibited potent immunomodulation activity. Its oxide mononuclear cells, and monocytes with other wide-ranging agonist activities that reduced Four clerodane diterpenes crispa T. crispa is a herbaceous vine 65 different compounds including flavonoids, lactones, furanoditerpenes, alkaloids, lignans, and steroids, which have been isolated and used traditionally to treat a wide range of ailments ( [120](#B120)). Magnoflorin, syringin, cardioside, quercetin, eicosenoic acid, and boldine are some of the active constituents of the plant with higher antioxidant potential than ascorbic acid and also responsible for activating the immune system by increasing the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and INF-. The plant extract was shown to increase the chemotaxis and phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmented the production of NO, ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines ( [120](#B120)). Studies suggested that T. crispa is a rich source of nutrients and antioxidants and showed hypoglycemic effects in an in vivo experimental study ( [121](#B121)). The stem extract of the plant also showed application in prolonged recurrent malaria treatment at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses ( [122](#B122)). Curcuma domestica C. domestica (turmeric) is an Indian traditional medicine popular as dietary spice. Its polyphenolic compound, curcumin, is the main compound isolated from rhizome. Curcumin is available in various commercial preparations and effectively used in the treatment of several health problems. Curcumin has shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of cerebral malaria through immunomodulation mechanisms ( [123](#B123)). It is found to inhibit NF-B activation and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production with expression molecules on endothelial cells ( [11](#B11), [124](#B124)).

The important plants showing immunomodulation activity, along with their regional sources, bioactive constituents, and other reported biological activities, are listed in [Table 1](#T1). Table 1 List of selected plants demonstrating immunomodulation activity, source countries, parts used, their bioactive chemical constituents and other reported activities. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an ancient practice of therapy involving use of various forms of herbal medicines, exercise, acupuncture, dietary therapy and massage. It has been proven to be an effective approach to treat various health problems including viral infections. Recently, some reports were published regarding the effectiveness of the TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. According to the reports, TCM has been identified to be much effective in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and had played vital role in controlling the spread of the disease in China ( [241](#B241)- [243](#B243)). Use of decoction based on the TCM principles among the medical professionals prevented the iatrogenic infection of the virus. TCM exhibited excellent curative potential; mainly responsible for early control over the spread of new viral infection and thought to be main reason for faster cure rate and discharge from the hospitals in China in comparison to other countries ( [1](#B1), [241](#B241), [244](#B244), [245](#B245)). Treatment of COVID-19 based on TCM has also achieved good results as in one of the study ( [246](#B246)), it was reported that out of 1016 diagnosed COVID-19 patients in Hunan province of China, 981 were treated with TCM and 95.76% (779 patients) of them were discharged. Moreover, out of the 233 hospitalized patients, all were cured using TCM with 100% recovery rate ( [246](#B246)). In another study, 51 out of 52 COVID-19 patients receiving TCM treatment, showed either improvement or were cured and discharged, with one death ( [247](#B247)). Decoction prepared from a mixture of Chinese herbs is the most popular therapy of COVID-19 in TCM and the herbs including Armeniacae Semen Radix et Rhizoma and Ephedra herba commonly mentioned in Chinese guidelines ( [241](#B241), [248](#B248)). At molecular level, TCM products were reported to exhibit antiviral property either by directly inhibiting the viral particles by heat clearing and detoxification or indirectly through regulation of body's immune response. In this regard, Gentiana, Astragalus, Acanthopaax senticosus and Salvia were found to induce Ig and IFN and produce antiviral activity ( [241](#B241)). Chinese Multi herbal formula, Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) optimized for COVID-19 was recommended by government bodies contains quercetin, kaempferol, luteoline, isorrine and naringin as the first five active ingredients. QFPDT was found to act by modulation of body's immune response, inhibition of inflammatory responses, protection of nerve and lung functions through regulation of MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, IL-6, ( [98](#B98), [249](#B249)). Future Perspectives Dysfunction of immune system has been evidently implicated with the development of a number of diseases and modulating and maintaining an efficient immune system has proven to be a justified approach in the treatment of associated diseases. However, there are certain limitations to this approach owing to the complexity of immune system as well as the unavailability of expedient analytical tools to measure the immune functions. Future research on NK cells, cytokine receptors and markers and blood-borne particles are warranted. Despite these limitations, certain medicinal plants have been tested to offer novel avenues for the immune system modulation either alone or in combination and the results are very encouraging. In comparison to other immunity-targeted therapies such as the administration of monoclonal antibodies, plants and their derived products have shown important advantages including abundance and lesser adverse effects. Nevertheless, these medicinal plants have to undergo standardization assessing both quality of the product and the methodology of research. Another scope of future research on medicinal plants is the chemical modification of active ingredients directed to enhance its efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties. For example, curcumin is not effective alone clinically owing to its absorption and metabolism issue, but chemically modified curcumin (demethoxycurcumin and bis-demoethoxycurcumin) have shown better druggability properties and are under clinical trials. Many of the active constituents of these medicinal plants face the pharmacokinetics related problems and suffer from poor absorption and rapid metabolism leading to poor bioavailability. Several alternate strategies are being adopted and researches are being focused on the development of nanotechnology-based formulations, changing the way of administration and changing the drug delivery technique. Another promising approach is to test the combination of active constituents obtained from these medicinal plants which could achieve targeted therapy and have synergistic effects with reduced toxicities. Multitarget drugs can also be designed by linking the bioactive molecules by means of suitable spacers and fusion or amalgamation of the pharmacophoric elements which are essential for the activity to get the hybridized molecule. The mechanisms by which these medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules demonstrate immunomodulation are complex and involve multiple signal transduction pathways. Most of these products show extensive and multiple pharmacological effects and their targets and molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated and understood. Most of the reported biological activities of these medicinal plants are based on cell based in vitro and animal based in vivo studies, but high level clinical studies are still required to establish their efficacies and toxicities in humans. It is therefore expected that with the advancements in the future molecular level studies, these medicinal plants and their derived products would demonstrate promising breakthroughs and constitute one of the important approaches for immunotherapy. Conclusions Respiratory diseases caused by viral infections including influenza and common cold are globally widespread apart from the repetitive viral outbreaks from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Direct treatment of such viral infections by modern medicines are not very efficient, and although vaccination is considered to be effective in preventing viral infections, the incidence of acute respiratory infections could be reduced only to some extent. Consequently, alternative treatments for viral infections are necessary, and in this regard, the stimulation of the body's immune defense system could be an efficient method of preventing these infections. A wide range of plant extracts, herbal products, and pure plant constituents have shown potential immunomodulation effects and used either as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for infectious diseases. Apart from infectious diseases, plant-based immunomodulators can help treat several other immunologic and inflammatory illnesses including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, etc. These plant products and their bioactive molecules modulate immune responses through the stimulation and modification of lymphocytes, macrophages, and cytokine production. Many plant extracts contain a of active principles, including polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, and essential oils, which have tremendous capability to maintain and/or stimulate the immune system primarily through the modulation of nonspecific immune responses. However, these plant extracts may contain one or more of the active constituents and their relative contribution and mechanism in the generation of immunomodulation activity are difficult to understand. Isolated pure plant constituents may prove to be specific and effective immunomodulators capable of counteracting the high cost and adverse effects of modern medication. Nevertheless, the drawbacks associated with the application of plant products include the development of standard testing and quality control protocols need to be properly addressed. The present review highlights the importance of medicinal plants containing immunomodulating components of different chemistries with possible utilization in controlling the viral infections. This might stimulate the efforts of researchers towards developing alternative plant-based treatments for infectious diseases. Author Contributions HA and MA developed the concept of the manuscript.
