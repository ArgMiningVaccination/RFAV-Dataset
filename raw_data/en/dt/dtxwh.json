The Lowdown on Nutritional and Other Approaches It's possible to take a [natural approach to back pain](//www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/photos/8-alternative-treatments-for-pain-management.aspx) by using supplements that can reduce inflammation and provide some pain relief. Supplements work best when used in combination with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management, says [Carrie Bowler, DO](http://www.onemedical.com/nyc/physicians/), a physician with One Medical Group in New York. But the word \"natural\" on a supplement doesn't automatically mean safe, so it's important to talk with your health care provider before you begin a new regimen. Some supplements can interact with other medications and cause complications, and some just plain don't work. Glucosamine and Chondroitin [Glucosamine](/drugs/glucosamine) and chondroitin are both compounds that occur naturally in the body \u2014 glucosamine in fluid around joints and chondroitin in cartilage surrounding joints, according to the [U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/744.html). Navid Farahmand, MD, an interventional [pain management](/pain-management/physical-activity-and-therapy.aspx) physician with the Brain and Spine Institute of California in Newport Beach, says that while there aren't studies on the effectiveness of glucosamine chondroitin supplements for [back pain](/back-pain/guide/) sufferers, there have been studies that show a meaningful impact on chronic knee pain. Many use it for other [chronic pain conditions](//www.everydayhealth.com/arthritis/heat-and-cold-therapy.aspx) such as low back pain, he says, adding, \"In my clinical experience it does help some but not all patients.\" Your health care provider will look at your personal factors, including age and overall health, to determine the proper dosage for you. Vitamin D If you have back pain, a [vitamin D deficiency](/vitamin-d/) could be making your pain worse. A study published in [Pain Physician](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23511683) in 2013 found that severe pain was associated with a high prevalence of [vitamin D](/drugs/vitamin-d) deficiency in people with lumbar [spinal stenosis](/spinal-stenosis/guide/), a condition with lower back pain as a symptom. The recommended daily allowance, or RDA, of vitamin D is 15 micrograms for most people, according to the [Office of Dietary Supplements](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/). Your doctor will determine your recommended dosage based on your unique needs. Sunlight exposure and vitamin D-fortified foods, such as milk, also supply the nutrient. Devil's Claw Devil's claw extract comes from a native African plant called Harpagophytum procumbens. Data suggest that a daily dose of 50 milligrams (mg) of harpagoside, one of the active ingredients in devil's claw, can reduce flare-ups of chronic low back pain, Dr. Farahmand says. [The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/984.html) reports that devil's claw may be effective for reducing back pain because its chemicals may decrease the inflammation and swelling that cause pain. The supplement is marketed in several different formulas. When deciding which one to try, look for harpagoside among the active ingredients on the label. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids is something Dr. Bowler says can help with inflammation that can cause back pain. Supplements are available in liquid or capsule form. Talk with your health care provider about your proper dosage because higher doses of omega-3's can increase the risk for bleeding and may interfere with any blood-thinning medications you may be taking. You can also increase your intake of omega-3's simply by eating more oily fish, such as salmon, sardines, and tuna, as well as dark leafy greens. Turmeric [Turmeric](/drugs/turmeric) is one of the supplements Bowler frequently recommends to her patients for its [anti-inflammatory properties](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-pictures/foods-that-fight-inflammation/). The spice, which is commonly used in Indian curry dishes, can be taken as a powder in capsules, mixed into tea, or as a liquid extract. [The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric/ataglance.htm) (NCAAM) reports that turmeric is considered safe for most adults, but prolonged use could cause stomach upset. As a dietary supplement, it's not recommended for people with [gallbladder](/gallbladder/guide/symptoms/) disease because it can make the condition worse. Capsaicin The agent that gives hot peppers their heat, [capsaicin](/drugs/capsaicin-topical) has a long history of being used for medicinal purposes. Although it comes from food, capsaicin isn't a nutritional supplement but rather comes as a cream, typically applied three to four times a day, or a single-use patch. It works by desensitizing channels that send pain signals to receptors in your brain. A review article that discusses a study of more than 1,500 people with chronic pain, published in 2011 in the [Journal of Pain Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048583/), showed that capsaicin had a pain-relieving effect in 38 percent of study participants with musculoskeletal pain, and the relief lasted through four to eight weeks of follow-up. Traditional Chinese Herbal Medications Traditional Chinese medicine with [herbal remedies](//www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/natural-pain-remedies.aspx) that originated thousands of years ago has made its way to the United States. But not all Chinese herbal supplements are created equal, Farahmand cautions. \"There have been reports of serious and life-threatening events such as liver damage associated with their use, as these products are not standardized or regulated,\" he explains. [NCCAM](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm) warns that some Chinese herbal medications have been found to be contaminated with toxins or [heavy metals](//www.everydayhealth.com/heavy-metal-poisoning/guide/) or don't actually contain the ingredients listed on the label.Farahmand recommends consulting your health care provider before starting any type of Chinese supplement.
