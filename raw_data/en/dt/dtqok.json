These tips can help ensure your treatment is effective and keep your immune system in good shape. If you have the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, you need to be especially vigilant about keeping your immune system strong. HIV kills important cells in the immune system called CD4 lymphocytes, or T cells. In people with HIV, the number of T cells can fall dangerously low, leading to a weakened immune system state called [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome](/hiv/guide/), or AIDS. Adhering to [treatment for HIV](/hiv/guide/treatment/) is a must. In addition, you can start taking these steps to get in the best physical shape possible to help boost your immune system. Eat Healthy Foods to Maintain Good Nutrition A healthy diet can help keep your immune system strong when you have HIV. Foods like fish, beans, and nuts contain protein, which can help you build muscle. Getting enough protein is especially important, notes the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.eatright.org/health/health-conditions/hiv-aids/nutrition-tips-to-keep-the-immune-system-strong-for-people-with-hiv-aids), as are calories from carbohydrates and healthy fats. Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can provide [essential vitamins](/vitamins/guide/) and minerals and also keep you feeling full. Maintaining a healthy weight with the right diet can also help you absorb HIV medications, according to [HIVinfo](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-nutrition-and-food-safety), a web resource from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). People with a weakened immune system also need to pay close attention to food safety in order to prevent foodborne infections that can be more difficult to fight off, notes HIVinfo. RELATED: [HIV and Your Diet: How to Get the Nutrition You Need](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hiv-aids/healthy-eating-for-people-living-with-hiv/) Avoid Drugs and Drink Alcohol in Moderation If you have HIV, using drugs and drinking alcohol can compromise an already weakened immune system. The liver, in particular, which helps remove toxins from the body, can be damaged by alcohol and drug use, according to [HIVinfo](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-substance-use) [. Recreational drugs and drinking can also impair your judgment, says the ](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-substance-use) [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/substanceuse.html) (CDC), leading to risky behavior like engaging in unsafe sex and forgetting to take your HIV medications on time and as prescribed. Some recreational drugs can also interfere with or interact dangerously with the medications used to keep HIV in check. If you drink alcohol, advises the HHS, do so in moderation \u2014 this means one drink a day for women and no more than two for men. Take Care of Your Teeth and Practice Good Oral Hygiene People with HIV are at risk for tooth and mouth problems, according to the [National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/hiv-aids/more-info). When your immune system is compromised by HIV, conditions such as oral warts, [fever blisters](/cold-sores/), [thrush](/thrush/guide/), and [canker sores](/canker-sore/) are more likely to develop and can be harder to fight. Many people with HIV/AIDS also experience dry mouth, which can increase the risk of cavities and make it difficult to chew and swallow normally. The [American Dental Association](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/dental-care-concerns/questions-about-going-to-the-dentist) recommends brushing and flossing regularly, and visiting the dentist at least every six months, or as directed by your dentist. Don't Stress \u2014 or at Least Do What You Can to Lower Your Stress Levels Reducing stress is an essential part of your treatment regimen, because the chronic stress of [living with HIV](/hs/living-well-with-hiv/health-tips-for-managing-hiv/) by itself can take a big toll on your overall health and well-being. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361287/) has shown a link between stress and reduced immune system function. Stress can also interfere with your appetite, sleep patterns, and other aspects of your daily life. Some great ways to manage stress include yoga, meditation, exercise, and counseling or therapy. To get the best results, talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program. RELATED: [How to Find Stress Relief and Reduce Stress for Good](//www.everydayhealth.com/stress/guide/relief/) Try an Alternative Therapy Like Acupuncture to Alleviate Some Symptoms Many people with HIV manage their symptoms and any side effects of medications with complementary and alternative medicine therapies. In particular, [acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/), the practice of inserting very thin needles into specific points on the body, may alleviate certain types of chronic pain. While there haven't been studies specifically demonstrating that [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) stimulates immune function in people with HIV, research has shown that acupuncture increases CD4 cells in [people with cancer](/cancer/guide/), according to [CATIE](https://www.catie.ca/a-practical-guide-to-complementary-therapies), a Canadian resource for HIV information. It's important for your acupuncturist to use sterile, disposable needles. More information about the effects of acupuncture, as well as different approaches and resources for finding an acupuncturist, are available through the NIH's [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction). Be Careful and Safe When Traveling Abroad If you have HIV, it's important to take extra precautions when traveling internationally. In particular, be especially careful about the food and water you consume. While foodborne illnesses can be unpleasant and even dangerous for people who are healthy and in good shape, they can cause severe complications and even death in people with HIV. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/livingwithhiv/travel.html) notes that travel to developing countries may increase the risk of opportunistic infections. When you're planning a trip, be sure to talk to your medical care team at least four to six weeks beforehand to get advice about vaccinations and preventive medications you might need, and stock up on extra supplies of your HIV medications. Review your health insurance policy to see what kind of coverage you have while traveling. Keep an Eye on Your Skin \u2014 and Take Any Changes Seriously A severe skin infection that doesn't clear up or respond to treatment can sometimes be a sign of something serious. According to [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hiv-and-aids/hivaids-and-skin-conditions), people with weakened immune systems because of HIV often have simultaneous or persistent skin conditions \u2014 either because they're more susceptible to certain infections or because of inflammation. [Rashes](/skin-and-beauty-photos/common-skin-rashes.aspx) are among the most common side effects of HIV medications, per [HIVinfo](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash) [. So watch your skin carefully for changes, and be sure to have skin problems examined promptly.](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash) Be Sure to See Your Gynecologist Regularly HIV raises a woman's risk of developing [cervical cancer](/cervical-cancer/guide/), according to the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hiv-fact-sheet), so HIV-positive women should be particularly mindful about getting regular Pap smears. The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health](https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/pap-hpv-tests) suggests that women with HIV get an initial Pap smear at the time of HIV diagnosis and another one year later, though some experts recommend a second Pap test within six months of the initial test. Because women with HIV are also more likely to develop recurrent and more aggressive forms of [yeast infections](/yeast-infection/guide/) and [pelvic inflammatory disease](/pid/guide/), [HIV.gov](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/staying-in-hiv-care/other-related-health-issues/womens-health-issues) notes, be sure to tell your doctor about any symptoms of these conditions right away. Boost Your Knowledge of HIV Take control of your health and future by learning as much as you can about HIV and AIDS. Start by talking to your doctor. Check the [Everyday Health HIV/AIDS Center](//www.everydayhealth.com/hiv/guide/) and government websites such as the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html) and the [HIVinfo](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/home-page) site from the HHS. Local and online support groups can also be a great resource to get information directly from other people with HIV or AIDS. Be Consistent and Always Take Your Medication on Time This last \"tip\" is the most important of all: Be sure to continue to stay on top of your prescribed treatments and take all of your required medications at the indicated times. Skipping doses of medication or not taking HIV medication on time as prescribed allows HIV to multiply, and higher levels of HIV in your body (what's called viral load) further compromise your immune system. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help you achieve and keep an undetectable viral load, according to [HIV.gov](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/staying-in-hiv-care/hiv-treatment/taking-your-hiv-medications-every-day/). When you don't adhere to your treatment, the virus also has the opportunity to become resistant to your HIV medication.
