You'll benefit from special arrangements IUP has made with chiropractic colleges in Missouri, New York, Texas, and South Carolina that allow you to transfer credit from your first year at chiropractic school to IUP to satisfy your senior-year graduation requirements. A maximum of 30 credits of the 120 needed for your IUP bachelor's degree can be applied from your first year at an affiliated chiropractic school. At IUP, you'll take a block of classes in biology, chemistry, and physics to give you a solid foundation for further schooling. You'll also take at least 24 credits in the humanities and social sciences. If you prefer to finish your bachelor's degree in four years at IUP, there are other options and other IUP majors you may want to consider. "}
