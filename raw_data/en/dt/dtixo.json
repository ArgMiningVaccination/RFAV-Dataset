Marine veteran Chad Robichaux survived combat in Afghanistan and came home to build a mixed martial-arts career, gathering flashy titles and fame-loving fans. What he failed at was the rest of his life. A few years after returning from war, Robichaux became separated from his wife and contemplated suicide. What he credits with saving him is faith. Now, his Temecula-based nonprofit group is part of a nationwide circle of Christianity-based programs focused on post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, as a generation of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer the aftermath of combat. Their emergence raises provocative questions about the interplay of science and faith when addressing medical conditions such as PTSD and depression. The issue was catapulted onto the national stage this month when Robichaux raised the subject of \"spiritual fitness\" at a town hall meeting with Donald Trump. \"While the military and [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] are working on the problem, their efforts continue to fall short,\" Robichaux, 41, told the Republican presidential nominee at a Oct. 3 campaign event in Virginia. \"Spiritual fitness works on these types of problems. The government is not taking advantage of these programs and services. Will you support and fund a more holistic approach?\" said Robichaux, who founded Mighty Oaks Warrior Programs in 2011. The idea of religion to cure ailments is even more ancient than the Old Testament. Robichaux and others who run like-minded programs said they aren't trying to replace licensed psychologists and therapy regimens that have been proven over time to treat post-traumatic stress. But they do say some veterans come to them after not finding relief in traditional treatments. \"It's not either-or,\" Robichaux said last week during a telephone interview from Montana, where he was attending a graduation ceremony for some Mighty Oaks participants. \"But sometimes they aren't getting any other care because they haven't been successful, so they kind of threw their hands up.\" Are psychology professionals wary? Somewhat. Be a smart consumer, said Sonya Norman, director of the PTSD consultation program at the VA's National Center for PTSD. \"If that really pulls you, certainly check it out and learn about it and how well it works relative to other treatments,\" Norman said. Robichaux's organization largely provides peer-to-peer mentoring. The instructors are veterans who themselves started out as Mighty Oaks Warrior students. \"What we do really well is, we bring guys to the point of wanting to accept responsibility for their situation, which is really important, and making a decision to move forward,\" he said. \"We provide a set of things to align their life by, and that's where the faith piece comes in.\" This \"blueprint\" is rooted in Christian scripture. Another faith-based program is the nonprofit Reboot Combat Recovery, founded at Fort Campbell in Kentucky by an occupational therapist who worked with returning soldiers suffering from traumatic brain injury, or TBI. That therapist, Jenny Owens, saw her patients asking questions outside of the realm of medicine. \"While we're seeing huge ground gained when it comes to TBI, when it came to the healing of the self, the healing of identity, the healing of the heart, it seemed like there was still something lacking,\" said her husband, Evan Owens, now chief executive of Reboot, formed in 2012. The Owens began inviting former patients over for dinner in the military community surrounding Fort Campbell. \"A curriculum emerged. Fort Campbell took note of it and said, 'We want you guys to come on base and lead this,'\" Evan Owens said, adding that most people come to them after traditional therapy. With its 12-week course, Reboot Combat Recovery has spread out nationally to more than 20 locations. Course topics include \"a wounded soul\" and \"the cost of unforgiveness.\" In January, the group expects to launch sessions at Camp Pendleton for active-duty troops, their families and veterans. Mighty Oaks offers a six-day program focused on resiliency and reintegration. In addition to veterans, the group ministers to active-duty troops who get permission from their commands to attend. Many participants are repeat attendees. Next year, they will be in four states: California, at a retreat built for the group in Paso Robles,Texas, Virginia and Ohio. Both Reboot and Mighty Oaks tout their track records. Each has graduated at least 1,000 program participants and said no student or alum has committed suicide. Mighty Oaks said some vets on its more than 100-person waiting list have taken their own lives. Reboot also measures its results on a patient-reported outcomes scale recognized by the National Institutes of Health. Graduates reported statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and fatigue, the group says. But, in the world of science \u2014 particularly the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs -- the two gold-standard treatments for PTSD are prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy. These two methods have been blessed with the key words of psychology: evidence-based treatment. In other words, since PTSD was recognized as a condition in the 1980s, these two versions of \"talk\" therapy have been studied enough to prove that they work, usually in conjunction with anti-depressant drugs that can be unpopular with veterans. However, Norman of the VA's National PTSD Center said there can be a moral or spiritual portion to a veteran's experience of combat trauma. \"If (faith) is something that previously gave them meaning or joy \u2014 and in the experience of PTSD, they've lost that \u2014 I check with them if that's something they want to reconnect with,\" she said. \"I'm not going to counsel someone on their spirituality, that would outside of my expertise, but I will certainly help someone connect with their spiritual leader.\" Norman said that faith can be helpful. But is it enough to recover from PTSD on its own? \"We just don't have evidence of that. And there's no standard. It's likely coming from different traditions of Christianity,\" Norman said. A faith-based PTSD program in Iowa came under fire from licensed therapists last month after The [ Des Moines Register investigated its unusual technique](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/09/10/faith-based-ptsd-treatment-draws-professionals-doubts/89897144/). The program, called Operation Zhero and launched this year, offers a free treatment to veterans that involves tapping oneself on the shoulder when bad memories surface. Counselors tell participants to remember that bad memories are not their fault and there's nothing they can do about them. Chad Robichaux, the Mighty Oaks founder in Temecula, takes a different-strokes-for-different-folks approach. \"We are not in competition with anyone. Some individuals need psychologists, some need medicines, some need all sorts of things. And others just need to accept responsibility and make better choices moving forward,\" he said last week. Here's where the Marine Corps veteran becomes critical of the status quo \u2014 echoing his question to Trump at the town hall. \"We're not a program of the VA because they won't allow us because we are faith-based,\" Robichaux said. \"There's a single path to getting help (at the VA,) and it's a clinical path,\" he said. \"What I'd like to see is a list of programs that get vetted, based on a statistic of success, and make those programs available, so when a veteran has an issue, they can look at a multitude of options.\" The VA has experimented with some alternative methods for PTSD, including acupuncture and [groundbreaking research at the San Diego VA](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sdut-ptsd-try-meditation-and-yoga-2012jan08-story.html) on meditation. At present, groups like Robichaux's depend on fundraising to make their programs free to veterans. According to Mighty Oaks' 2014 tax form, the group raised $125,000 in donations. Robichaux said the current figure is nearly $2 million annually. Reboot raised $305,000 in 2015, according to its form. Robichaux is a powerful spokesman for his approach, making savvy use of the internet to [share video testimonials](https://www.mightyoaksprograms.org/ourstories/) of his personal redemption story. \"I discovered that what created the circumstances in my life were the choices I was making every day. I still had the ability to choose differently,\" he said. \"I've always been a fighter. But now I get to fight for the most important thing in "}
