These oils are concentrated for use in humidifiers, lotions, or combined with mild oils. The oils are usually derived from flowers, herbs, and tree extracts. The types of oils used include eucalyptus, lavender, and orange. If you are interested in aromatherapy massage and live in the Peckville area, contact Dr. DePietro at DePietro Chiropractic and Wellness. What is Aromatherapy Massage? An aromatherapy massage is a combination of aromatherapy and traditional massage therapy. Essential oils are added to the massage to enhance the benefits. The massage therapist diffuses the oil in the room during the massage session. We may add drops of oil to the lotion used during the massage and apply it directly to the skin. The Benefits of Aromatherapy Massage There are many benefits to aromatherapy massage, including pain management, improved mood, and relaxation. Aromatherapy massage can also reduce symptoms of depression, insomnia, nausea, pain, stress, and anxiety. Certain oils, like lemon and orange, are stimulating and known to improve mood. Other oils like chamomile provide relief for anxiety. Lavender is used for relaxation and eucalyptus for pain management. Furthermore, aromatherapy massage helps ease joint pain even if the joint pain is a result of exercise, physical activities, or older age. Oils like wintergreen can reduce tension found in the joints. There are even oils intended to remove stiffness and inflammation. Why Consider Aromatherapy Massage? Aromatherapy is quite safe. It has only a few precautions associated with it. It is critical to make sure that you are not allergic to any of the oils that the massage therapist intends to use. This is because you will inhale the oil and have the oil in direct contact with your skin.
