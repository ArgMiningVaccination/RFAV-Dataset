Starting with a centre in Beijing in 2010, the institute is setting up a similar centre in Delhi by March 2014. The centre in Delhi shows the emphasis the university places on research engagement in India, said president [Robert J Zimmer](/topic/robert-j-zimmer), in an interview to ET during his recent visit to formally announce the centre. Edited excerpts: What has prompted you to set up a centre in Delhi? We have been thinking about the general question of how the University of Chicago should take an active position on global engagement. The success of our centre in Beijing prompted us to come up with something similar in Delhi. What brings you to India? There are two reasons that bring us to India at this point in time. First that it is very important for our faculty and students to have much more connection with Asia as a whole. Not only because China and India are two of the largest countries in Asia and offer great depth of faculty and students, but also, the recognition of the huge cultural, social and political changes in Asia is prompting us to be here and enhance our research and collaboration activities in this part of the world. Secondly, as a university, we have a long history of interest in Asia and India in particular, and so it is very natural for us to establish a centre here to strengthen collaboration among scholars and students from India and Chicago. Will the [Indian government](/topic/indian-government)'s recent move to allow foreign universities to start campuses in India affect your plans here? We are not looking to create any campus here. We want to continue to build and expand the research interest of our faculty and students, thereby creating education opportunities and collaboration. Our Beijing centre has been a huge success. And that is why we are so optimistic about our centre in Delhi. What are the areas of focus for your research and collaboration? We will provide opportunities for research and collaboration in business, economics, law and policy; science, energy, medicine and public health; culture, society, religion, and the arts.
