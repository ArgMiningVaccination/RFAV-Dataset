That might make things a bit quicker than making the food dyes yourself if you are looking for a more natural alternative! :) Cheers! [annadavid](https://food52.com/users/2317916-annadavid)July 19, 2021 For yellow colour we can use turmeric which is a good antioxidant.Sometimes I use Saffron extract of Kancor. https://manekancor.com/saffron-extracts https://manekancor.com/saffron-extracts [Tea](https://food52.com/users/612492-tea)May 9, 2020 Important to note that too much base makes the cabbage green. Which is good or bad depending on your needs. So just a sprinkle of baking soda makes it blue/purple but more makes it green. This is important to note because if you're adding to something acidic (Buttermilk) or lacking acid The color will change. [Leora C.](https://food52.com/users/1849006-leora-cramer)October 19, 2019 Thanks for the article. I wonder if mugwort or moringa can be used as green dyes. Or other ground plants or leaves? Any time I see matcha, I think of those two. [Novice](https://food52.com/users/1841722-novice)October 8, 2019 Hello pls could you tell me how long the dye will keep when made up ie can I make it the day before I make my cake and icing? Doing red cabbage blue dye hopefully. I'm guessing I need to store it in the fridge? Thanks for any advice. thanks thanks [William J.](https://food52.com/users/1730083-william-james-alexander)April 9, 2019 I would suggest replacing coffee with espresso since coffee is processed through gas lit fire with a stone mill while espresso is roasted by sun's UV rays and then kept the way it is to ground by a stone mill. Either way if wanting to stay natural on the colors it's best to know what has health benefits behind the curtain of each food product you buy. Also butterfly pea tea is another good source to making blue food pigment especially when grounding the tea to a powder.

[CAITLYN M.](https://food52.com/users/1666941-caitlyn-mcneill)January 9, 2019 How long before the dried royal icing colors fade/separate? I've use other all natural dyes before & they separated/spotted in the royal after 2 days - is that normal? I'm new to using all natural food dyes, so I'm grateful for any advise.

[Esvee](https://food52.com/users/195685-esvee)May 11, 2018 I had such high hopes for this. I followed the directions for blue food coloring to a t, made it a week before my daughter's third birthday. I wound up adding the entire bottle of coloring to homemade buttercream and now have a gloomy gray cake. Not sure how this is going to go over but I tried! [Esvee](https://food52.com/users/195685-esvee)April 18, 2018 This is such an old article, but I hope someone out there can help out! I love the pale blue icing above made with red cabbage -- could I use this food coloring to tint buttercream instead? I have a request for a pale blue birthday cake! TIA! [Jk P.](https://food52.com/users/928527-jk-papa)February 20, 2018 Where do you all buy beet powder, strawberry and blueberry powders? Thank you [Susanne H.](https://food52.com/users/1023529-susanne-hofer)April 1, 2017 I use blueberry powder (freeze-dried blueberries, pulverized in a coffee grinder) and baking soda for the color blue!! [Courtney C.](https://food52.com/users/494622-courtney-c)March 18, 2016 Thank you so much for this article! I love decorating cookies, but I'm pretty grossed out by all of the chemicals in the dyes that I have to use for coloring. These will be much better! Even if the colors are not intense, I love the subtle tints - perfect for Spring! [Bascula](https://food52.com/users/135856-bascula)March 18, 2016 Seriously, the pronunciation thing again? The fact that you CAN'T pronounce the name of an ingredient doesn't make that thing bad! The fact that you CAN pronounce the name of an ingredient doesn't make that thing good! Please think of another way to say what you mean - like 'colors from things you can find in your home/buy at the grocery store' or the like. Sorry for the rant, but I get tired of this pronunciation \"rule\" I see everywhere as though it made sense.

[Ben](https://food52.com/users/921172-ben)March 18, 2016 Perfectly said, the chemical responsible for color of berts is part of the Betacyanins family. The true IUPAC name being much much longer. Stop spewing garbage about pronunciation having anything to do with food safety. Let me give you an example. I can pronounce lead easily, that doesn't mean I should be putting it in my "}
