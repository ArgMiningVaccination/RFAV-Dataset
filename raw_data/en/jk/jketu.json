Interesting Features What are the features of a grasshopper? Legs How many legs does it have? Are they alike or different? Which legs are the jumping legs? Notice where the legs are attached to thegrasshopper's body. Wings Look at the wings, if they are present. How manywings are there? Notice where they attach to the body. Head Look at the head. How many eyes do you see? Dothey look like your eyes? Check carefully in frontand below the large, compound eyes for threesmaller, simpler eyes. Why do you think they haveso many eyes? These eyes probably see light butmay not be able to see shapes, sizes, and colors. Mouth Do you see a mouth? Does the grasshopper havelips? Try to feed the grasshopper a leaf to watchthe mouth parts move. Hold the leaf up to themouth just touching it. Do not try to put the leafin the mouth, of the grasshopper. Try to describethe mouth parts and how they move. Antennae Where are the antennae? Are they each a long,string-like, single appendage, or are they made upof many parts? Can you count the parts? Do theyall look alike in size, shape, and color? Why do you think a grasshopper needs the antennae? Forwhat? Think about radio and television antennae.Motion We usually think that grasshoppers \"hop.\" Do they also walk? How do they walk on the groundor floor? If possible, watch the grasshopper climb a small stick, weed stem, or blade of grass. Does it use all of its legs? Without hurting yourgrasshopper, place it on the ground and make it jump (if it is an adult with wings, it may flyinstead). Follow it and make it hop or jump several times (at least five times). Does it hop the same distance each time? Measure or estimatethe distance of each hop or flight. Does thegrasshopper seem to get tired? What makes you think so? Noise Do grasshoppers make noises? If your grasshoppermakes a noise, try to learn if it does it with itsmouth or with some other part of its body. Colors Look at the whole grasshopper carefully. Is it the same color all over? Are the colors, shapes,and sizes the same on both sides? What is attrac-tive about your grasshopper? Is it clean? Watch to see what the grasshopper does to clean orgroom itself. Habitat Where does the grasshopper live? What does iteat? Do grasshoppers live in your neighborhoodyear-round? Suggest two reasons why grasshoppersmight not be seen during the winter (such asfreezing temperature, not enough food). Conclusions Did you think there were so many interestingthings about grasshoppers? Do you think otherinsects might be as interesting? What other insectsor small animals might be interesting to look atand learn more about?

WEIGHT AND AGE RELATIONSHIPS FOR BLACK BEARS CHART (Data are characteristic of black bears in the southwestern United States. There will be regional variations.)Project WILD K-12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 6....................................................................................................Bearly GrowingEcological Knowledge........................................................................................................ The black bear ( Ursus americanus ) can be found in the United States, Canada, and Alaska. In theeast, the black bear primarily inhabits forestsand swamps. In the west, the black bear roamschiefly in mountainous areas. Black bears are primarily nocturnal but occasionally roamaround during the mid-day. A black bear's life span averages 20 to 25 years. Longevity and survival of the black bear dependupon the availability of a suitable habitat and itsability to avoid humans. An adult female bear is called a sow. An adult male bear is called aboar. A baby bear is called a cub. When a sowbecomes sexually mature between 2 and 3 yearsold, she is capable of breeding and may have oneto four cubs. Contrasted with human fetal devel-opment of about 9 months, the sow is pregnantfor about 7 months. The sow has her cub or cubs in the shelter or den where she spends the winter months.On average, a female black bear will have twocubs. The sow does not have a litter every yearbut every other year. At birth, a young cubweighs about 8 ounces\u2014about the size of aguinea pig. Bear cubs stay in the den with theirmother until they are able to move around veryactively, usually until late April or early May. Bears and humans are classified as mammals, which means that both are warm-blooded, nour-ish their young with milk, and are covered withvarying amounts of hair. Bear cubs and humanssurvive solely on their mother's milk for the firstfew months of life. Cubs nurse while in the den and only for a short time after leavingthe den in early spring. By the time berries ripenand grasses are plentiful, the cubs have learnedto climb and can eat the available food sources.Soon the cubs will need to hunt and gather foodfor themselves without the help of the sow. Atabout 18 months of age, the cubs must go outsearching for their own home range. The sowwill allow the female cubs to stay within herhome range. The male cubs, however, must findterritory to claim as their own. Black bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plant and animal material. In early spring,they tend to eat wetland plants, grasses, insects,and occasionally carrion (dead animal matter) orthe protein-rich maggots found near the carrion.In late spring and early summer, bears feed onberries, grubs, and forbs (broad leafed plants). Inlate summer and early fall, bears feed mostly onnuts and acorns. In the fall season, bears mustadd much fat to their bodies in order to survivethe winter months in their dens. Cub growthwill vary throughout the country. When black bear cubs reach one year of age, the female cubs weigh 30 to 50 pounds and themales weigh 50 to 70 pounds. A mature femalebear weighs 150 to 185 pounds, and a male bearweighs about 275 pounds.

Barnacle/Whale Commensalism Barnacles create home sites by attaching themselves to whales. This relationship neither harms nor benefits the whales. Remora/Shark Commensalism Remoras attach themselves to a shark's body. They then travel with the shark and feed on the leftover food scraps from theshark's meals. This relationship neither harms nor benefits the shark. Bee/Maribou stork Commensalism The stork uses its saw-like bill to cut up the dead animals it eats. As a result, the dead animal carcass is accessible to some beesfor food and egg laying. This relationship neither harms nor benefits the stork. Silverfish/Army ants Commensalism Silverfish live and hunt with army ants, and share the prey. They neither help nor harm the ants. Hermit crab/Snail shell Commensalism Hermit crabs live in shells made and then abandoned by snails. This relationship neither harms nor benefits the snails. Cowbird/Bison Commensalism As bison walk through grass, insects become active and are seen and eaten by cowbirds. This relationship neither harms nor benefits the bison. Yucca plant/Yucca moth Mutualism Yucca flowers are pollinated by yucca moths. The moths lay their eggs in the flowers where the larvae hatch and eat some of the developing seeds. Both species benefit. Honey guide bird/Badger Mutualism Honey guide birds alert and direct badgers to bee hives. The badgers then expose the hives and feed on the honey first. Next the honey guide birds eat. Both species benefit. Ostrich/Gazelle Mutualism Ostriches and gazelles feed next to each other. They both watch for predators and alert each other to danger. Because the visualabilities of the two species are different, they each can identifythreats that the other animal would not see as readily. Both species benefit. Oxpecker/Rhinoceros Mutualism Oxpeckers feed on the ticks found on a Both species benefit. Wrasse fish/Black sea bass Mutualism Wrasse fish feed on the parasites found on the black sea bass's body. Both species benefit. Mistletoe/Spruce tree Parasitism Mistletoe extracts water and nutrients from the spruce tree to the tree's detriment. Cuckoo/Warbler Parasitism A cuckoo may lay its eggs in a warbler's nest. The cuckoo's young will displace the warbler's young, and the warbler will raise the cuckoo's young.

I'm Thirsty I'm Thirsty Animals can have incredible adaptations in order to survive in their environments. Use the following hypo-thetical example of the desert bighorn sheep: Thedesert bighorn live in dry, sparsely vegetated areas ofthe southwestern United States. Temperatures on sum-mer days are frequently over 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C). Duringthe hottest months of summer, ewes (females) andlambs come to waterholes almost daily. The male sheep(rams) sometimes do not come to water for nearly aweek at a time. Rams may roam 20 miles (32 kilome-ters) away from the available water supply. Add 20miles (32 kilometers) to the approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) traveled per day, and rams may travelalmost 75 miles (120 kilometers) before they drinkagain. Rams are believed to drink approximately 4 gal-lons (15.2 liters) of water when they do come to water,while an ewe drinks approximately 1 gallon (3.8 liters)and a lamb drinks 2 pints (940 milliliters). Questions for Students 1. How many miles to the gallon (or kilometers per liter) does a ram get? 2. How many gallons (or liters) of water would a ram drink in a month? 3. How many gallons (or liters) of water would a ewe drink in a month? 4. How many gallons (or liters) of water would a lamb drink in a month? 5. How much water must be available in a waterhole for 10 rams, 16 ewes, and 7 lambs in order for themto survive the months of June, July, and August? 6. What rate of inflow would a waterfall have to have to sustain the population given above if water evaporated at a rate of 10 gallons (38 liters)per day?Project WILD K-12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 28....................................................................................................Ecological Knowledge........................................................................................................

NOTE: An area of the forest has been clean harvested and abandoned. A fire occurred on the site after it was abandoned. 3 to 5 Y ears The first plants to invade prefer bright sunlight. The fire released many of the nutrients in stumps and branches left behind during the cutting of the area. Grasses\u2014such as broom straw, golden rod,and other herbaceous plants\u2014have taken over the area. The area is also green with sprouts from treestumps that were not killed by the fire. Woody shrubs\u2014such as blackberry, wild grape, sumac, andviburnums\u2014are beginning to grow. Here and there, a young coniferous tree\u2014such as red cedar or field pine\u2014is beginning to reach above the grasses. 15 to 25 Y ears The overall vegetation is dense as the plant community converts from shrubby field to forest. Maples,birches, oaks, and other hardwoods join pines and cedars. Few acorns and other nuts are being pro-duced. Vertical layers are becoming distinct. At 25 years, the young hardwoods are approximately 40 feet tall and starting to shade out \"sun-loving\" shrubs such as blackberries and brambles. Othershrubs more tolerant of shade\u2014such as blueberry, serviceberry, and spice bush\u2014may continue to grow,although the blueberry will not produce as many berries. Hemlock and white pine, which thrive inunder-story shade, may begin to grow. More Than 100 Y ears As taller plants occupy the site, less light is available on the surface of the forest. Plants tolerant ofshading will out-compete plants that are intolerant of shading, and gradually the composition of theforest will change to favor shade-tolerant species. Distinct layers can be identified in mature forests.The canopy layer consists of trees 60 to 100 feet high, including mixed oaks, hickories, sugar maple,beech, birch, or other hardwoods, or hemlock and white pine. An understory layer 30 to 40 feet highhas trees such as dogwood, hornbeam, and saplings. Below this understory, a shrub layer about 3 to 4feet high, might blackberry, arrowwood, ivy,Virginia creeper, and are vines that span all layers. An herbaceous (nonwoody)layer of perennial, annual, and biennial plants is found at the forest floor.Descriptions of Three Successional StagesProject WILD K-12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 38....................................................................................................Time LapseEcological Knowledge........................................................................................................ Grass/Herb: Grasses and herbs cannot tolerate excessive shade. They grow quickly, but havenonwoody stems and do not reach a greatheight. Shrub: Shrubs have woody stems and are usually intermediate in height between grassesand trees. They can tolerate some shade. Sapling: Saplings are trees that have not reached full height. They may be the size of large shrubs. Mature tree: These trees have reached their full height and form the canopy layers. Songbird: Songbirds in this area live in mature trees. Squirrel: Squirrels build their nests in trees but are seen on the ground and moving throughtree branches. They eat fruit, berries, and nuts. Garter snake: This snake lives in grassy areas and shrubs. It eats toads, earthworms, smallbirds, and mammals. Toad: Toads live in meadows and shrub lands. They eat insects and other invertebrates. Wild turkey: Turkeys roost in trees and need clearings and brushy fields for nesting. Mouse: Mice live in burrows and eat berries, grains, and insects. Owl: Owls in this area nest in trees but hunt the ground for mice and shrews. Black bear: Bears live in the thick forest where they have plenty of cover. They eat a variety of plant and animal matter.Deer: Deer eat grasses, shrubs, and crops. They prefer an edge community where they can hide but also venture periodically into openareas to browse. Grasshopper: Grasshoppers live in grassy areas and eat grass, clover, and other herbs. Rabbit: Rabbits live in edge communities where there is plenty of shrub cover to hide, plusgrasses and other herbs to eat. Quail: Quail nest in shrub areas where they have cover, but they may feed in more open,grassy spaces that supply many insects. Sparrow: Sparrows nest in shrub and tree areas where they have cover but may feed in moreopen spaces that supply many insects. Cardinal: Cardinals are red to brownish-red birds that nest in the high branches of shrubs or low branches of trees. They feed on berries,seeds, and insects gathered from plants or fromthe ground. Robin: Robins live in edge communities where there are open grassy spaces, shrubs, and smalltrees. They build their nests in the branches of younger trees and eat berries, worms,and insects. Fox: Foxes live in burrows called dens. They prefer some ground cover for hunting, and theyfeed on birds, mice, rabbits, insects, and berries.Descriptions of Plants and Animals\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 39....................................................................................................Ecosystem FaceliftEcological Knowledge........................................................................................................

A 1,000-year flood has destroyed the plants and animals on Belle Island. The 20-acre island is in the mid- dle of a tidal river. (Tidal rivers are open to the ocean and experience daily tidal fluctuations.) It has a large hill on the ocean side of the island (the side affected by the tides), and there is a low area capableof sustaining a marsh on the opposite side of the island. The island also has a flat plain that was formerlya meadow. The island has been used in many different ways since Europeans settled the area; originally itwas used as a plantation. Later, industries powered by hydro-electricity were located on the island. Beforethe flood, the island was overgrown with a mixture of native and non-native plants and was inhabited bya variety of native and non-native wildlife.

Memoir I: From the Stories of Johnny Kincaid I was a scrawny kid who'd come to the Great Plains from Chicago looking for wealth and adventure inthe spring of 1870. I didn't know what I would dowhen I got there, but I knew I would do somethingadventurous. When I arrived in Dodge City, I waspenniless, tired, and hungry. I wandered the street,alone and scared. A huge man, about 6 4with arms as big as two men and shoulders of steel, saunteredup to me. He wore buckskins and had a rifle flungacross his shoulder. I was impressed. He introduced himself as Sure Eye Jones (to this day, I do not know his real name). He asked if I waslooking for work. He explained that he needed askinner to go with him on a hunt the next day. Hesaid he'd cover all my grub and pay me handsomelyfor each buffalo hide. I didn't know at that timewhat a skinner was, but it sounded like a good dealto me. Besides, I was desperate. We headed out into the prairie land the next day looking for the big herd. Another man named DougMcKinnon, who was an experienced skinner, camealong. He promised to teach me all he could aboutskinning. He gave me both a long bowed knife tohang on my hip and another short knife, somethinglike a dagger, to strap on my boot. They were sharpenough to cut paper. Doug explained skinning to me while we searched for the herd. He told me wewould prepare the hides for sale back in Dodge Cityand that my earnings would depend upon how manyanimals I could skin in a day. The more I did, themore money I would make.As we traveled, I became excited about the hunt and the thought of making money. We came overthe crest of a hill and saw the buffalo below us. Itwas a huge herd that covered the open plain as far as the eye could see. Some were young, some werecalves, and some were heavy with young not born.It was an amazing sight. As my eyes lingered on theherd, a crack rang out in the air as a bullet shot intothe herd and took out a yearling, which Doug whis-pered to me would be our dinner for the next fewdays. Sure Eye (now I realized how he got his name)took aim again and shot another. Crack after crack of the rifle rang out as Sure Eye killed buffalo afterbuffalo. It wasn't until he had killed 30 or so that he stopped. Doug hollered at me to \"Move it!\" We raced down the hill and began our work. It took us all day andlate into the night before we had skinned all thedead animals. Sure Eye came by and said, \"Welldone, boy! As far as I can figure, you just made yourself a whole heap of money. Well done.\"He slapped me on the back and moved on back to camp. I continued to skin buffalo until there were no more to be found. I earned a great deal of money and wasable to return to Dodge City to build a home; marrymy wife, Sally; and work in town. Some days I miss those grand herds of buffalo stretching across the horizon. It was quite an adventure, those early days on the prairie.Prairie MemoirsProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 48....................................................................................................Memoir III: From the Diary of Catherine O'Riley Early in the year of 1860, my husband and I left the forest lands of Missouri for the tall grass prairieof the area now known as Oklahoma. Our dreamwas to build a cattle ranch in this fertile grassland.We had been told that this was a wild area, but itwas also rich in opportunity. However, in this landwithout trees, building a house, corrals, and barnsbecame a problem. Providing water proved to be aneven more difficult task. We soon knew that survivalin this new land would require us to be strong andself-sufficient. The first years on the ranch were tough. We were not prepared for what happened the first time aherd of buffalo moved into our cattle grazing area.The buffalo were large, aggressive animals, and thecattle scattered in fright. The buffalo depleted the grass and rolled in the dirt, creating great dustclouds. These large animals trampled anything thatgot in their path, and constructing barriers did noth-ing to change their course. Along with the buffalocame the native tribes. Many tribes had been relocat-ed to the Oklahoma Territory, but they did notalways stay on their reservation lands.We thought the U.S. government with the soldiersfrom the area forts would make sure the tribesstayed on the land they were given. The government,however, was fighting a civil war. The only soldiersthat we had to protect us and our property wereuntrained recruits, and they caused more problemsthan they solved. Many ranchers in the area met todiscuss a way to handle the problem of the roamingherds of buffalo and the roaming tribes. Someone had heard about the buffalo hunters hired by the railroad. Supporting these buffalo huntersseemed a good way to remove the threat of theseanimals. It was also suggested that if the tribes stayedon the reservations, the government could providethem with cattle. Then they would not need the buffalo, and we would have a new market for ouranimals. However, it was obvious that it was up to us to protect our property and livelihood. By 1890, the buffalo and the native tribes were removed from the plains, and cattle freely grazed on the lush grass of the open public range. The bestcows and bulls were kept and the breeds constantlyimproved. For the next few years, ranching was oneof the most profitable industries in the country.Prairie MemoirsSocial and Political Knowledge........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................Memoir II: From the Stories of Gray Hawk Back in the days when the Earth was new, my forefathers hunted buffalo on foot. The buffalo flesh provided my people with food, and the skinbecame clothing and the sheltering cover of tepees.My people's daily life revolved around the buffalohunt, and our rituals and worship were dedicated to its success. Then the Spaniards brought horses, and many of these animals wandered over the plains. My peoplelearned to tame and ride these wild animals. Webecame great horsemen. The horse allowed us tobecome great hunters; it helped us follow the buffaloherds. We also crafted tools to help us hunt. Hunterscarried a short bow, a quiver for barbed arrows, and a long shear. Because the hunters were able to ridewith hands free, they could feed and release the bow,and the hunts became more and more successful.With the horse, our tribe was able to follow the buffalo and have a steady supply of food. The tribegrew. Often, small hunting groups would leave thelarger tribe, but each summer all our people wouldreunite for the sacred ritual dance. This ritual lastedfour days in which we honored the buffalo withofferings and ceremonial dances. Our dance celebrat-ed the natural cycle of the grass, the soil, and thebuffalo. We honored the buffalo, for it provided uswith our daily needs. The buffalo herds began to grow smaller. We had become skillful hunters, and settlers came to live onour land, build railroads, and hunt buffalo. The buffa-lo could not survive; the natural cycle had beenchanged. Then the settlers' government told my peo-ple we had to change our ways. We were told whereto live and that we could not continue to follow thebuffalo herds. The fact was that the buffalo herds were gone and that the ways of ourancestors would continue only in our stories.\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 49....................................................................................................Power of a SongSocial and Political Knowledge........................................................................................................

Dilemma Card A deer herd has grown so large during the past 10 years that many of the deer appear to be starv-ing. The herd is severely damaging the habitat,eliminating much of the vegetation that the ani-mals use for food or shelter. There is a disagreement within your community as to whatcourse of action is best to take. You personally areopposed to hunting. A limited legal hunt has beenproposed to reduce the size of the herd in thisarea.

Wild turkeys are nativeonly to the North and South American continents.Once there may have been as many as five differentspecies, but if so, most of these became extinct in pre-historic times. Before European settlement, scientistsestimate that 7 to 10 million turkeys were in NorthAmerica. Turkeys have been used as a source of food for thou- sands of years. At the Indian Knoll site in Kentucky,archeologists found large quantities of turkey bones,second only to the number of deer bones. Radiocarbondating procedures indicated that these turkey bonesexisted before 3,000 BC. The use of turkey as food varied among Native Americans. The Navajos, Tonkawas, and Lipans ate turkey, as did the Native Americans living inConnecticut. However, many Apache would not eat turkey, and the Cheyenne believed that eatingturkey would make them cowardly. Turkey feathers were used widely by Native Americans to make blankets, quilts, dresses, coats, and robes. TheCheyenne, as well as other native groups, used turkeyfeathers on their arrows. In 1612, Captain John Smithnoted turkey spurs (from old gobblers) being used asarrow tips in Virginia. Feathers were also used to fash-ion ceremonial masks and headdresses and turkeybones were used to make spoons, beads, and otherornaments. Many Native American groups\u2014like the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Mohawk\u2014left turkey hunting to thechildren. Today's turkeys are very wary of people and are difficult to hunt. However, it appears that in the past turkeys were not shy of people and wereconsidered too easy to hunt to waste the time of theexperienced hunters.Wild Turkey Cards Card 2 During the 1600s when Europeans began settling inNorth America, wild turkeys still were very plentiful.In fact, in 1709 there were reports of turkeys number-ing 500 to 1,000 birds in one flock. The settlers beganto rely on turkeys as an important source of foodbecause turkeys were so plentiful and the meat wastasty. The turkey's primary feathers also were used for writing quills. As the continent's population grew (more than 4 million by 1790), more forested land was cleared for farms, towns, cities, industries, roads, and railroads.Wildlife continued to provide food, clothing, and goods for trading and marketing. During this time,there were no effective laws regulating the use of land and wildlife. As expansion continued, wildlifebecame scarce near towns and cities; consequently,settlers were not able to go out easily to hunt for theirown food.From the late 1700s through the 1800s, markethunters helped supply food for settlers, selling deer,elk, turkey, bison, and other wildlife to markets andrestaurants. Initially, wild turkeys sold for as little as 25 cents each. By 1900, turkeys were $5.00 each in Chicago. Continued habitat loss, combined withmarket hunting, which allowed hunters to sell theirgame to markets for profit, was taking a toll on manywildlife species. By 1813, wild turkeys were gone from Connecticut. They were last seen in Vermont in 1842, in New Yorkin 1844, in Michigan in 1897, and in Iowa in 1907. By1920, the wild turkey was lost from 18 of the original39 states of its ancestral range and from the Canadianprovince of Ontario.\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 75....................................................................................................Let 's Talk TurkeySocial and Political Knowledge........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................Card 3 All turkeys in the world, including the domesticated turkey, are classified into two species. The wild turkey(Meleagris gallopavo ) is the most common turkey and is found throughout North America. The ocellatedturkey ( Meleagris ocellata ) is the other species and is found on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, northernBelize, and the El Peten region of northern Guatemala.The wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo ) is divided into six distinct the eastern wildturkey ( Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ) is the largest and most common subspecies. It originally ranged in theeastern half of the United States. Another subspecies,the Mexican turkey ( Meleagris pallopavo gallopavo ), is the forerunner of all domesticated turkeys we have in the world today. The Mexican turkey is the smallestof the six subspecies of the wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo . Originally, it was found in southern Mexico, but it is now considered extinct. Domesticating a species involves raising the animals in captivity and selectively breeding them for generations.Usually they are bred to benefit people (e.g., moremeat, etc.). Eventually, they become very differentfrom their ancestors in behavior and appearance.When Hernando Cortes arrived in Mexico in 1519,the Aztecs already had large flocks of domesticatedturkeys. The Aztecs had domesticated those turkeysfrom the Mexican wild turkey. How long the Aztecskept domesticated turkeys is uncertain, but some sci-entists think those turkeys were introduced to NativeAmericans in the southwestern United States before1350 A.D. The Aztecs used these birds mostly for theirfeathers and for sacrificial ceremonies. There are alsoreports that Montezuma, Aztec Emperor in 1519, fedabout 500 domesticated turkeys daily to his menagerieof hawks, owls, and eagles. By 1520, Spanish explorers took domesticated turkeys from Mexico to Spain. From there, the turkey quicklyspread to Italy and France and then throughoutEurope. By 1541, the domesticated turkey had reachedEngland. By 1573, the turkey was so plentiful that itbecame part of the typical Christmas dinner. Withselective breeding, new varieties of domesticatedturkey were developed. By 1802, there were at leastfour standard varieties known in England. Card 4 When the Spanish arrived in Mexico in the early1500s, they were greatly impressed with the turkeys that had been domesticated by the Aztecs.Consequently, they took the domesticated turkey backto Spain, where farmers raised it throughout Europe. Domesticated turkeys soon became part of the stan- dard supplies sent with English colonists to America.In 1607, domesticated turkeys were brought back to North America with the settlers at Jamestown.Domesticated turkeys were also sent to help feedEnglish colonists in Massachusetts in 1629. Soon small flocks of turkeys were being kept by many of the early colonists. During the 1700s and 1800s, the propagation of domesticated turkeys stayed on a small, local scale.But even at this scale, changes were occurring to thedomesticated turkey. The initial domesticated turkeyswere smaller than the turkeys of today. They also weresmaller than the eastern wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopa- vo silvestris ) found commonly throughout the eastern United States. During this time there were reports thatlocal farmers captured wild turkey gobblers (males) and bred them with domesticatedturkey hens (females) to obtain a larger bird. In the 1920s, large commercial turkey farms were established in the United States. By World War II,turkey farming was a major industry. Over the years,selective breeding of domesticated turkeys led totoday's domesticated turkey. Domesticated turkeys are now larger and plumper than wild turkeys.Domesticated turkeys come in a variety of colors,and they cannot fly. (Some of the early breeding ofdomesticated turkeys was done for feather quality and not necessarily meat.) Some of the most populardomesticated turkeys are the Beltsville, Small White,Black, White Holland, and Bronze. Turkey farming continues to be a major industry. The United States raised about 275 million turkeys in1999, with North Carolina producing more turkeysthan any other state.Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 76....................................................................................................Let 's Talk TurkeySocial and Political Knowledge........................................................................................................ Card 5 Before European settlement, scientists estimate that there were 7 to 10 million wild turkeys in NorthAmerica. By the 1930s, there were about 30,000turkeys in the wild. The habitat destruction, unregulat-ed hunting, and market hunting of the 1700s and 1800s decimated the wild turkey populationthroughout North America. Land and wildlife were affected as the number of settlers grew. A few laws were passed to try to protectland and wildlife but with the lack of consistentenforcement of the law throughout the country, mostsettlers did not realize that turkey populations werelimited. By the end of the 1800s, the reduction inwildlife populations could not be ignored. By 1900,wild turkeys\u2014along with deer, elk, bison, pronghorns,passenger pigeons, and other species\u2014were reduced tosmall populations found only in a fraction of their orig-inal ranges. By 1914, the passenger pigeon becameextinct. Many people feared that the wild turkeywould suffer the same fate.Scientists, hunters, foresters, bird watchers, and othersinterested in turkey conservation formed organizationsto urge conservation. In 1875, the American ForestryAssociation was founded, emphasizing the conservationof trees and forests. Theodore Roosevelt and GeorgeBird Grinnel established the Boone and Crocket Club,an association of hunters interested in conservation. Naturalists and writers published books and articlespromoting conservation. In 1876, John Muir wrote of the need for the government to protect the forests.Henry David Thoreau published \"Walden\" in 1854.In 1870, essays and stories were published in Harper'snew Monthly Magazine deploring the destruction of American wildlife and attracting the attention of peo-ple throughout the country. In 1849, the Depart-mentof the Interior was formed and by the end of the 19thcentury, some states had formed wildlife agencies.These organizations, as well as popular writings, slowlybegan to influence the opinions of the general publicand lawmakers. The stage was set for the recovery ofthe wild turkey. Card 6 In 1891, the President of the United States was giventhe power to create forest reserves through the ForestReserve Act. State laws and the Lacey Act of 1905\u2014afederal law that limited interstate shipment of illegallytaken wildlife\u2014curtailed market hunting. The Pittman-Robertson Act of 1937 helped provide funds to statesfor use in wildlife recovery programs by placing anexcise tax on hunting and sporting equipment. Manystates established hunting regulations and seasons and,although still small, now had wildlife agencies and personnel to enforce those laws. Some states also established wild turkey refuges, setting aside land for turkeys until the population could rebound. With the United States' entry into World War I in 1917 and the Great Depression of the 1930s, the conservation movement slowed. At the same time,abandoned farms and timbered forests reverted to theshrubs and forested land preferred by the wild turkey.After World War II, many state wildlife agencies start-ed to make plans to restore wildlife populations,including the wild turkey. Obtaining wild turkeys for use in restoration projects was difficult. One widely used method was to raisewild turkeys in pens and release them into the wild.This method was used for almost 20 years but ultimately was not successful. Pen-raised turkeys didnot have the skills needed to survive in the wild. In 1951, biologists began using the cannon-net method to trap wild turkeys for later transfer. A large net wasconcealed on the ground near bait and quickly pro-pelled over feeding turkeys by an electronically deto-nated small cannon. Using this method, along withimproving habitat for wild turkey, state wildlife agen-cies were able to increase the wild turkey populationin the United States to 1.3 million birds by the 1970s. Throughout the conservation and restoration move- ment, volunteer conservation organizations greatlycontributed to conserving habitat and wildlife popula-tions. Since 1973, the National Wild Turkey Federationhas partnered with state and federal wildlife agenciesto provide support in the restoration of wild turkeypopulations. Today nearly 5 million turkeys can befound in North America, including all states in theUnited States except Alaska. These birds provideopportunities for bird watchers, hunters, and otherpeople who appreciate wildlife.........................................................................................................\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 77....................................................................................................Social and Political Knowledge........................................................................................................

The twin fawns were born on a May day when the sun dabbled the edge of the forest throughthe newly budding leaves and apple blossompetals fell in the abandoned orchard like fragrantsnow. They were not the only twins that year;food had been plentiful in the valley and white-tailed deer were sleek and round-bellied. Even as the doe licked her offspring clean, strength flowed into the young bodies. It hadn'thurt that she had been able, through the fall andwinter, to slip into a nearby farm at night forcorn, alfalfa and clover to add to the leaves,twigs, juicy weeds, acorns, and mushrooms theforests and fields offered to the white-tails. The valley was a generous place for the herd of 60 animals. Where the hillsides dipped downto meet the farm fields, the shady forest ended.This edge meant that food was varied and abundant. It hadn't always been that way. In the early 1700s, when the valley was first settled, the forests were widespread. Sincewhite-tailed deer require a mixture of forest,openings and edge, they were present but notplentiful then. By 1900, however, the deer pop-ulation had been almost eliminated by a humanappetite for venison. Too much hunting hadreduced the size of the herds. Much of the onceabundant forest had been cleared for woodproducts and used as agricultural lands. This lim-ited suitable habitat for the deer. Later, laws con-trolled hunting, and changes in land use prac-tices led to a return of some of the forest. Themixture of agriculture and young forests provid-ed an excellent environment for the deer herdsand with the regulated hunting, they thrived.The young plants that grew in the open areas ofthe cut-over forest yielded an abundance offood, and by the 1930s, there were more deer inthe valley than when the settlers first came.That soft, May afternoon saw another birthdaycelebrated in the valley. The boy ran out to greet his father who was climbing down off the tractor after a day of making furrows for the spring planting. He looked up into the lined face of his father and barely contained his impatience while the farmer removed his hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead witha big, blue kerchief. \"Is it time?\" the boy asked breathlessly.The man smiled down at his son\u2014a strong, wiry boy, made tough by summers of throwing haybales and winters of chopping wood. \"Yes, Jamie,\" he grinned. \"It's time.\" He put his arm across the boy's shoulders, and they walkedup onto the wide porch where a table stooddecked with early daisies and tiger lilies in aMason jar, bright orange and yellow paper napkins, and a three-layer chocolate cake with 12 yellow candles. The boy's mother wasalready sitting at the table, pouring tall glasses of foamy, fresh milk. \"Do you want us to sing first?\" She laughed as Jamie scraped the chair legs across the porchfloor in his haste to get to the table. \"Nope. Where's my present?\"\"Now, Jamie,\" his father scolded good-naturedly, \"birthdays aren't just for presents. This is a spe-cial year for you and it brings with it not just agift but some responsibility. You're no longer alittle boy. You're a young man. This is not abirthday for toys.\" Jamie looked down at his hands on his lap. \"I know, Dad; I'm sorry.\"The Twins By Dr. Clifford Knapp and Suzanne Iudicello\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 83....................................................................................................The HunterSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ But when he looked up again at his father, the excitement and expectation shining in his eyeswere not those of a serious young man, but of a boy about to burst with anticipation. As his mother cut the cake, Jamie's father took from behind the door a long, narrow box tied with a gold ribbon. \"Okay, son, this is what you've been waiting for, and we won'tkeep you from it.\" Jamie tore the ribbon from the box and lifted the cover. There, gleaming in the soft yellowcloth, lay the rifle. It wasn't new, but the glosson the stock showed a new coat of oil andbetrayed hours of careful rubbing, and the barrel shone with new bluing. The scratches he remembered on the dull gray were gone,but the initials his grandfather had carved on the stock were still there. He drew the rifle from the box, taking care to point it away from anyone as his grandfatherand father had taught him. It was much heavierthan the .22 he'd lugged through the woods tostalk squirrels. \"It's yours now, Jamie, just as we promised,\" his father said. \"You're 12 now and old enough togo deer hunting this fall.\" Although Jamie thought the fall would never arrive, the summer passed quickly, filled withdays of helping his father in the fields, fishingand swimming, and lots of practice with the rifle. In the hills above the farm valley, the twin fawns gained strength quickly. By June, they followedthe doe along the well-worn trails. As summerripened, they roamed with the herd over thelength of the valley and high on the hillsides.They were just two of 50 fawns that had beenborn that spring, swelling the herd from 60 tomore than 100.They fed on leaves, twigs, fruits, and nuts of thetrees and shrubs in the forest and on the grassesand weeds along its edges. The summer habitatprovided abundant food. The doe and her fawnsgrew strong and healthy on the bounty. This wasfortunate, for the stark winter ahead would notoffer such abundance. November blew in rainy and cold, and Jamie was restless after the crisp, bright days ofOctober. The harvest was complete, the fieldslay in a stubble under the gray sky, and the fewbrown apples remaining on the trees were torndown by the wind. He sat in the warm kitchenand looked out at the glistening black branchesscratching at the sky. \"Can I go out, Mom?\" he asked. She looked up from the lunch dishes at her son, his dungareecuffs well above the tops of the worn boots andthe elbows frayed out of his plaid flannel shirt.The restlessness was about to burst his skin ashis growing body had burst the seams of most of his clothes that summer. \"All right, but wear your father's poncho,\" she called as he was already halfway out the door,the rifle over his shoulder. Jamie knew, from his summer forays and from past autumns when he'd been too young tohunt, that the deer often came down to theabandoned orchard to nip at the withered applesthat grew on the overhanging trees. That part ofthe farm wasn't used now, and the orchard hadlong since overgrown, producing only tiny, bitterfruits, but the deer seemed to like them. He hadwatched, enthralled many an evening, as theslender, tawny forms moved delicately and thenfroze like shadows in the dusk.Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 84....................................................................................................The HunterSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ As he trotted away from the yellow light in the kitchen window, dusk gathered and the rainturned to sleet. The gray afternoon was threaten-ing to turn bleaker yet. He scrambled over thecrumbling remains of a stone wall and enteredthe orchard in a blast of wind that nearly tookhis breath away. \"At least it's blowing towardme,\" he thought, settling in under a tree to wait.Just before nightfall, his patience was wearingthin, his foot was tingling where he had been sit-ting on it, the rain was trickling under his collar,and the sleet was stinging his face. He was aboutto stomp his foot to bring it back to life so hecould walk home, when the doe entered theorchard; Jamie caught his breath. The words of the wildlife license agent echoed in his ears as he raised the rifle to his shoulder.\"We're going to open the season this year\u2014bucks, does, fawns.\" The man had punchedJamie's slip of yellow paper for fishing and hunt-ing\u2014the first time he'd been the age to have a license for deer. \"This is your firsthunting season, son?\" he'd asked. \"Good luck.\" Jamie watched the doe down the barrel of the rifle. She was stretching up, her front feet off the ground, trying to reach a last, wrinkled apple clinging stubbornly to a high branch. Theslender neck glistened from drops of rain caughtin the soft hair. His heart was pounding, and hewasn't sure if he was still breathing. He reachedaround with his thumb and gently pushed thesafety off the rifle. Just then the twin fawns stepped delicately into the orchard, melting from the darkened tree trunks like slightly smaller shadows of thedoe. Jamie lifted his eyes from the barrel to thefawns. They, too, were stretching to try to reachthe last brown leaves and few apples high in thebranches but they were too short. They movedclose to the doe, where her efforts at pulling on the branches had jostled a few apples to the ground.Jamie refocused on the doe, sighted down thebarrel and let out a deep breath to steady hishand. Just then, a blast of wind ripped throughthe orchard, carrying sleet and snow before it,ripping a tree branch in its fury. The branchtumbled down and the three deer bolted backinto the thicket. The boy reset the safety on the rifle and gingerly got to his feet. He looked into the darkening skyand the tossing branches and thought, \"I'm glad.Maybe those three will make it through thewinter.\" Winter hit that night, lashing the valley with wind and snow that piled into high snowdrifts,and that froze into hard crusts and remained.The herd, trapped on the hillside, didn't movemore than a quarter of a mile the whole winter.They competed for the dwindling food supplythat remained poking above the snow and manyfawns and does died. Jamie thought often about the trio, as he looked out over the white landscape. The grip of the season finally loosened one moist, February day. Rain pelted the snow, turn-ing it to slush and pitted mounds where the mud showed through. Spring and summerreturned to the valley and with them the activi-ty that kept life for a farm boy busy and full. For the herd, the winter had taken its toll. Most of the fawns had died of starvation and cold, asdid many older bucks and does, weakened byage. The herd was reduced from the summerhigh of more than 100 to fewer than 50. Thoseremaining ventured down out of the hills to the greening valley where their favored plantssprouted anew. Throughout the spring and sum-mer, they found plenty of food to go aroundamong their reduced numbers, particularly sincefew fawns had been born after the harsh winter.\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 85....................................................................................................The HunterSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Summer's hazy, golden days burned into fall and as harvest time ended, Jamie's thoughts driftedagain to the abandoned orchard and his rifle.One evening he took it out of its wrappings andcleaned and polished it, wondering if the twinfawns were among this autumn's yearlings. The frosty straw stubble crunched under his feet as he made his way across the fields to theorchard. The passing of a year had seen morestones fall from the top of the wall and Jamienoted that the tree that had been his restingplace last season was uprooted and lying broken.He concealed himself among the twistedbranches and settled to wait. The evening was still, the sky a pale salmon color where the sun had just slipped below the hills. Jamie hoped the slight varying breezewould not carry his scent. He slid a round intothe chamber of the rifle, wondering how manytimes his grandfather had sat like this, in thisvery orchard, with this very rifle. He checked to make sure the safety was on. Dusk fell with the twittering of a few last thrushes, and Jamie started at the sound of asnapping twig. A yearling doe stepped into theorchard, the brush rustling back to fill the spacewhere she had emerged from the forest. Jamieexhaled quietly, trying to relax again, becausethis year was bucks only, the season restrictedbecause the herd had so dwindled over theharsh winter. He watched the doe nosing amongthe brown weeds for fallen apples, wondering ifshe was the fawn of last autumn. He watched,still, admiring the sleek brown sides and gracefulcurve of the neck. The doe raised her head andlistened, so close he could see her nostrils flick-ering to catch a scent. The deer glanced at theforest edge, tensed, and then bent her head tobrowse again as a yearling buck emerged fromthe same trail, disguised by the thick brush. Jamie lifted the rifle to his shoulder, nestling it close against the rough wool of his jacket. Helooked down the barrel at the young white-tail,wondering if these were the twins of that blus-tery evening a year ago. He questioned whetherthis time he would pull the trigger. \"He made itthrough the winter; who am I to kill him now?\"he asked himself. The buck stepped away from the doe and began pulling apples from the drooping branches. Itwould be a clean shot, Jamie knew, well awayfrom the doe, certain to be a quick kill. Heexhaled, steadied his arm and concentrated on a patch of rusty brown hair on the animal'sshoulder. \"I can't look at his head,\" he thought.\"I just have to keep thinking of him as meat formy family.\" As he thumbed off the safety, heallowed himself one last, stolen glance at thesculptured head, arching up to grasp an apple.Jamie swallowed and ... \"The Twins\" is adapted, with permission, from a story that originally appeared in Open Lands and Wildlife(Union, New Jersey: Pollution Control Education Center).Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 86....................................................................................................To Zone or Not to ZoneSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................

Riparian Zone Approximately 100 miles of what is called ripar- ian zone\u2014in this case riverbank property\u2014isvegetated in mature trees and associated plants.The property includes both publicly and privately owned land. Many of the riparianzone's tree species are not native to the area.These plants are non-native species. For the past 90 years, non-natives have been introducedinto this ecosystem. The non-native trees wereboth intentionally and accidentally introduced.Native trees still survive in the area but theirnumbers are declining. The non-native treeshave crowded out some of the native trees,creating a different type of habitat. Many nativewildlife species are not as well adapted to thenew non-native tree-filled habitat. Some ecologists have recommended that the non-native trees be eliminated from the riparianzone. These ecologists recommend that all of theriparian zone's properties be treated to eliminatethe non-native trees. Any non-native trees left in the riparian zone would be potential seedsources for re-establishing non-native trees in areas where they have been removed. Theecologists propose that the cut logs could besold as firewood or left on the ground. Because the land has many owners, there are several different philosophies about how theland should be managed. The riparian zone pub-lic lands include both a wildlife refuge that has a policy against cutting trees for anyreason and a state forest that permits treeremoval but lacks the funding to complete such a project. The tree removal could occur on private lands only if the property ownerschoose to let that happen. County ordinances would be necessary to prohibit any new introductions of non-nativespecies. The ordinances could allow for excep-tions for things like fruit trees, or could prohibitall non-native trees. These ordinances would particularly affect homeowners along the riverwho want to landscape or plant windbreaks.Many of the existing non-native trees are inestablished windbreaks and visual screens surrounding homes in this area. The public agency responsible for management of wildlife in the area and a group dedicated towildlife preservation strongly oppose the pro-posed plan to harvest trees. They argue that theimpact on wildlife in the area will be extreme.Local wildlife will lose food and shelter that isprovided by many of the non-native trees. Theyfurther argue that the project would cause manyfish and other aquatic organisms to die. Loggingwould remove shade that keeps the water cool.Because the roots of the non-native trees holdthe soil in the bank, their removal would lead toincreased siltation in the river. Other groups, including a local native plant association and a public agency responsible for endangered plants and animals, adamantlysupport the proposed plan to remove the non-native trees. They argue that native plants andanimals are losing their position in the environ-ment in favor of non-native plants and animals.Although they admit that short-term effects of siltation and habitat loss may present someproblems, they argue that the long-term effectsof re-establishing the native ecosystem will outweigh any short-term side effects. All of the involved land is found in one county. The county Board of Commissioners will hold a hearing on the topic of removing the non-native trees. The proposal is called \"The Vegetation Manipulation Plan for theRiparian Zone.\"At Issue: Land-Use Planning\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 91....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Changing the Land Almost 70 percent of the world's bird species are declining in population. Many birds are onthe endangered, threatened, or watch lists in different states and countries. The rapid declinein the species of birds worldwide signals that theecology of the planet is changing. What are themajor threats to birds worldwide? What are peo-ple doing to try to protect them? You will complete a simulation that focuses on certain types of neotropical migratory birds.These birds breed and spend summers in theUnited States or Canada and then travel greatdistances to their wintering grounds in Centralor South America. The majority of the approxi-mately 200 species of neotropical migratorybirds are songbirds. The life cycles of these migratory birds are very complex. To understand the population changesof these birds, you must consider the breedinggrounds in the north, the wintering areas in the south, and the migration path. Below aresome of the major threats facing neotropicalmigratory birds: habitat fragmentation nest predation cowbird parasitism urbanization linear development (i.e., roads, pipelines, and high tower lines) loss of habitat\u2014summer, winter, and stopover habitat You will investigate how forest fragmentation might affect populations of interior forest migra-tory birds. Forest fragmentation is the reductionof extensive, contiguous forest into smaller, iso-lated parcels separated by roads, fields, houses,and other development.Studies by the United States Fish and WildlifeService have shown that many forest birdspecies are rare or absent from many small,isolated habitat blocks of forest. It is difficult todetermine an exact size of territory needed inacres because minimum area estimates vary byspecies, regions, and habitat types. Despite thesedifficulties, general patterns of species of birdsare emerging. Some bird species are not sensitiveto habitat fragmentation and occur in habitatpatches of all sizes, whereas others are moder-ately or highly sensitive and rarely occur in smallforested areas. Listed below are samples of each: Moderate or High Sensitivity OvenbirdAcadian flycatcherScarlet tanagerWood Black-capped chickadee Bluejay Wildlife research now shows that many species of forest birds require large blocks of habitat.Moderate to high sensitivity species avoid habi-tat on the edge of built communities and do not nest successfully near edges. Populationsof these species generally do poorly in areaswhere habitat is broken, or fragmented, intosmall, isolated blocks. You will now look at two different scenarios for changes to a forested area and the effects of fragmentation on a wood thrush population.Student Reference Sheet A Neotropical Migratory BirdsProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 92....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Changing the Land The wood thrush can be found in the moist and shady deciduous forests throughout the easternUnited States. Because the population has beendeclining at a rate of 1 to 2 percent each yearfor nearly 30 years (1966-1994), it has been thesubject of many ecological research projects.Research conducted on the breeding groundshas centered on the effects of forest fragmenta-tion on nesting success. Forest fragmentation is the name given to the reduction of extensive, contiguous forest intosmaller, isolated parcels separated by roads,houses, agricultural fields, utility lines, logging,and other development. Carving up a forestedarea into smaller parcels creates more forestedge relative to forest interior. This processmakes the wood thrush nests more susceptibleto predators such as chipmunks, raccoons, bluejays, crows, and cowbirds. (The cowbird is a\"brood parasite\" that tends to select forest edgesfor reproduction and lays its eggs in other birds'nests. The \"foster parents\" usually raise the cow-bird young at the expense of their own eggs and young.) The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center reports find that wood thrush nesting success is greatestin large forested areas. Success rates decline with smaller forest size as a result of increasedpredation on eggs and young.Student Reference Sheet B Introduction to the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina ) Wood Thrush Creek Scenario: Present The area around Wood Thrush Creek has been forested for many years.

Cabin Conflict The following imaginary conflict is based on one family's real experience and similar cases. A dispute has arisen between owners of three cabins situated on deeded land that has beendesignated as a state wildlife primitive, manage-ment, or refuge area by a legislative act and bythe state wildlife agency. Under the act, allproperty owners would be required to sell theirproperty to the state or their property would becondemned and taken by the state. Two property owners use the property for weekend and summer homes while the otherproperty owner uses the property as an environ-mental learning base for her elementary schoolstudents, as well as for a summer cabin. Thisproperty owner would like to keep the propertyto enhance the educational program and for itshistorical value. Seventy-five years ago, the area was the site of a small mining community of about 500 people.Zinc and lead were mined. Part of the oldsmelter remains near the educational cabin.A black mountain of charcoal used in the smelt-ing process and several old mine shafts still exist. The existing three cabins are locatedon originally deeded mining claims of about 3 acres each.Cabin ConflictProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 96....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Back from the Brink species and helps provide funding for research and recovery projects. An amendment to the Lacey Act and CITES II (Convention on International Trade inEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) also protects the alligator by regulating interstate and inter-national commerce in alligator products. (A SouthAmerican alligator, not found in the wild in NorthAmerica, is not endangered and never has been. Thosealligators are sometimes sold in pet stores.) As a resultof such efforts, the North American alligator has madea complete recovery. Effective management, habitatprotection and restoration, law enforcement, and, insome states, reintroduction and restocking have enabledalligator populations to grow dramatically in recentyears. In 1987, the American alligator was reclassifiedfrom \"endangered\" to \"threatened.\" While North American alligator populations continue to grow in the southeastern United States, the humanpopulation and associated development is also increas-ing. Because many people want to live along water,waterfront property has become a prime area for housing developments. People share these water-ways with alligators while fishing, boating, swimming,and so forth. Greater contact has led to increased con-flict between people and alligators, and most conflictsare due to alligators being in places where people donot want them. Although these reptiles typically stayaway from people, people and alligator incidents canresult when alligators lose their fear of people becausesomeone has been feeding them. Alligators are largepredators and have also been known to prey on house-hold pets. To help manage alligator populations, some states now allow closely monitored hunting and trapping. Alligatorhide and meat are valued commodities. To help meetthis need, alligator farming has become a thriving busi-ness. Some states have allowed the limited collection of eggs and hatchlings by licensed alligator farms andhave allowed limited hunting by private individuals. North American alligators remain protected on state, federal, and international levels to help ensure theircontinued survival.The North American alligator, a member of the croco-dile family, can be found in marshes, swamps, shallowlakes, ponds, and waterways in the southeastern UnitedStates\u2014from Texas to Florida and as far north as theCarolinas and southern Arkansas. As adults, these largereptiles can weigh more than 500 pounds and measure8 to 13 feet or more in length. North American alligators are predators and eat a wide variety of foods including fish, turtles, snakes,birds, and small mammals. The North American alliga-tor has existed for more than 180 million years. It is well adapted to life in the wet areas of the south.Alligators are exothermic. They have no internalmethod to control body temperature and rely on waterto keep their body temperatures lowered in the hotsummers. The North American alligator helps retainwater in its habitat by creating holes that retain waterin times of drought. These \"gator holes\" help supply water for wetland plants and wildlife. During the early colonization of the southeastern United States, alligator populations remained fairly sta-ble throughout most of their range. However, at the end of the 19th century, it became fashionable touse alligator hide in boots, wallets, purses, belts, andother fashion items. Market hunters began to take alli-gators in large numbers to use their skins in the fashionindustry. In the 1920s, 200,000 alligators were killedeach year in Florida alone. During the 1920s, thousands of acres of wetlands also were being drained to provide more land for agricultureand development, and to limit mosquito populations.With the combined pressures of habitat loss and markethunting, alligator populations began to plummet. Bythe 1950s, the American alligator was on the verge ofextinction. Between the 1940s and the 1960s, the southeastern states began protecting their remaining alligator popu-lations. In 1967, the North American alligator wasplaced on the federal endangered species list, whichprovided it complete protection. It remained on the list under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This act emphasizes protection and recovery of endangeredNorth American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 97....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ In 1967, the black-footed ferret was placed on the federal endangered species list. By 1980, black-footedferrets were thought to be extinct. Then in 1981, apopulation of black-footed ferrets was discovered in aprairie dog colony in Wyoming. Biologists began tostudy these animals to determine what could be doneto protect this colony. By 1985, the colony had expand-ed to 129 animals. Unfortunately, an outbreak of canine distemper almost wiped out the colony. By1987, the 18 remaining black-footed ferrets were takeninto captivity as a last ditch effort to save the species. In 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adopted the Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan. State and feder-al wildlife agencies in cooperation with several zoosbegan a captive-breeding program to try to increase the number of black-footed ferrets. The goal of the program is to reintroduce these ferrets into the wild.Overall, the captive-breeding program has been a suc-cess. The first project to reintroduce black-footed fer-rets into the wild took place in 1991 in a prairie dogcolony in southern Wyoming. Since then, small num-bers of ferrets have been reintroduced into Montana,Arizona, Utah, and South Dakota. On-site breeding programs have also begun in Arizona, Colorado, andUtah. In 1998, more than 100 black-footed ferrets were born in the wild, and more than 400 were born as part of the captive-breeding program. Many challenges remain in this reintroduction effort. Little was known about black-footed ferrets, especiallyabout how to raise them in captivity while maintainingtheir abilities to survive in the wild. Land-use conflictsamong farmers, ranchers, and prairie dogs continue toexist, on public as well as private lands. Today, wheresome prairie dog species continue to be legally classifiedas \"pests,\" poisoning and other measures are being usedto control nuisance colonies. Urban development con-tinues to affect the land used by both prairie dogs andblack-footed ferrets. To help address some of the issuesassociated with the recovery project, the reintroducedblack-ferret populations have been designated as\"experimental nonessential\" populations under theEndangered Species Act. As land-use practices change and more prairie dog communities are eradicated, the final challenge may be to maintain enough suitable habitat and prairie dog communities for black-footed ferrets to survive in the wild.Back from the Brink The black-footed ferret is the only ferret native toNorth America. These long, slender mammals wereonce found throughout the Great Plains, ranging fromsouthwestern Canada to northern Mexico. Scientists do not think they were ever very abundant. The black-footed ferret is considered the rarest wild mammal inNorth America. Black-footed ferrets are members of the along with weasels, otters, minks, badgers, andwolverines. Although they occasionally eat rabbits,mice, and other small mammals, black-footed ferretsfeed almost exclusively on prairie dogs\u2014in fact, prairiedogs make up more than 90 percent of a ferret's diet. Prairie dogs are burrowing rodents that live in large groups often referred to as \"towns.\" At one time, theremay have been as many as 5 billion prairie dogs sharingthe prairie with ferrets and other wildlife. It is no coin-cidence that the ranges of these two animal speciesoverlap. Not only do black-footed ferrets rely on prairiedogs as their main food, but they also live and raisetheir young in the burrows of prairie dogs. Prairie dog towns provide food and shelter for many other animals as well. Prairie dogs are the prey of other predators such as coyotes and red-tailed hawks.Burrowing owls use prairie dog holes for nest sites, andmany species of snakes, lizards, and amphibians use theburrows for shelter and hibernation. Prairie dog towns provide recreational opportunities for wildlife watchers, photographers, and hunters. Althoughvalued or tolerated by many people, others considerprairie dogs as nuisances. Besides eating agriculturalcrops, they eat the prairie grasses that are also eaten bylivestock. Most of the land that could be developed insome areas is inhabited by prairie dogs. In addition,prairie dogs can contact sylvatic plague, which, whentransmitted to humans, is called bubonic plague. Since the late 1880s, many methods have been used to control and eradicate prairie dog communities. At thesame time, the majority of their habitat (more than 98percent) has been lost to development. Poisoning, trap-ping, shooting, and other control measures; habitat loss;and disease have led to a decline in prairie dog popula-tions. This loss of habitat and their major food supply,in conjunction with disease, caused black-footed ferretpopulations to plummet as well.Black-Footed Ferret (Mustela nigripes)Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 98....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Back from the Brink The gray wolf is a highly social animal, and lives in packs of two to more than a dozen animals. Within thepack there is a definite hierarchy of dominant and sub-ordinate individuals. Typically, only the alpha (lead orhighest ranking) male and female mate, which helpslimit the size of the pack and the number of newbornpups. The alpha pair, along with its offspring, forms thepack. Wolves hunt in packs and will share their foodwith pups and other adults in their pack. This arrange-ment is rare in the animal world. Gray wolves can survive in many habitats where food is plentiful. They usually live in isolated forested habitatsinterspersed with grassy areas where their prey\u2014deer,elk, moose, and other ungulates\u2014graze. Wolves arelarge animals and can weigh up to 175 pounds andmeasure up to 61/2feet in length, but most wolves are about half this size. Although named the \"gray\" wolf,the color of these mammals varies in shade from blackto white to gray. The gray wolf once was found throughout North America from Canada to central Mexico. WhenEuropean colonists began to settle in North America,they relied on many species such as deer and elk forfood and clothing and for trade. They had very littleknowledge about predators. Wolves, like other preda-tors, were viewed with fear or as competitors forimportant food sources. Settlers were also concernedthat wolves would attack their livestock or themselves.Consequently, as early as 1630, large bounties werepaid to people to kill wolves. The Massachusetts BayColony paid an average month's salary for the head of a wolf. As more people settled the land, the pressure on wildlife drastically increased. Between hunting and loss of habitat, many wildlife species, including elk,bison, and deer, were almost eliminated from parts of the country. The wolf was being pushed into an ever-decreasing range with a greatly reduced food sup-ply. Conflicts between wolves and people grew.Programs, including those subsidized by the govern-ment, were established to eradicate the wolf. By 1897,the eastern timber wolf ( Canis lupus lycaon ), a sub- species of the gray wolf, was eradicated from the northeastern United States.Wolves remained fairly common in the wild lands ofthe northwest through the early 1900s. However, con-tinued habitat loss and eradication programs persisted.By 1950, wolves had been eliminated throughout thecontiguous United States except for some remote wild areas in northern Minnesota. In 1967, the easterntimber wolf was included on the federal endangeredspecies list. In 1973, the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies ( Canis lupis irremotus ) was listed as endan- gered. With a relatively large eastern timber wolf population surviving in parts of Minnesota, there wassome confusion as to the legal status of the wolf in theUnited States. To clarify the situation, the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service (USFWS) reclassified the Minnesotawolf as \"threatened,\" and all other gray wolves south ofCanada were listed as \"endangered.\" The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides protec- tion for endangered species and requires that plans beprepared for the recovery of these species. Over manyyears, federal and state agencies, as well as interestedorganizations, conducted studies, held public hearings,and conducted opinion polls to help assess whichrecovery strategies would have the best chance of success. In 1987, the USFWS approved the RockyMountain Wolf Recovery Plan that designated three official recovery areas in the northern RockyMountains. These areas were in northwestern Montana(including Glacier National Park and the Bob MarshallWilderness); central Idaho (the Selway-Bitterroot andFrank Church River of No Return Wilderness Area);and the Yellowstone ecosystem (including YellowstoneNational Park and surrounding areas in Montana, Idaho,and Wyoming). During the early 1980s, wolves naturally began to re- colonize in northwestern Montana, dispersing southfrom Canada. By 1994, approximately 64 wolves werein Montana, forming five packs. As a result, plans forwolf reintroduction centered on central Idaho andYellowstone National Park. In 1994, final plans weremade for the reintroduction. And between 1995 and1996, 66 wolves were brought to the United Statesfrom Canada. Thirty-one were reintroduced intoYellowstone National Park, and 35 were reintroducedinto central Idaho.Gray Wolf (Canis lupus)\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 99....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Back from the Brink The reintroduction of wolves into the northwest has been very controversial. Wildlife biologists, environmen-tal organizations, and many individuals applaud the return of wolves as a step in restoring the naturalbalance in the ecosystem. Chambers of Commerce,shopkeepers, and entrepreneurs view the wolves as away to attract tourists to the areas and increase profits. In contrast, agriculture and some hunting and outfitting interests feel the introduction of wolves will affect theirability to make a living. Some are concerned that therewill be timber harvest restrictions where wolves havebeen reintroduced. Some hunters are worried thatwolves will reduce opportunities for big game hunting.Sheep and cattle ranchers fear wolves will prey on live-stock, thereby affecting their livelihoods. Wolves canand sometimes do prey on livestock. However, not allwolves do, even those near livestock. Wolves that doprey on livestock tend to continue to do so and mayteach their pups to do so as well. Some people haveexpressed safety concerns as they enjoy outdoor recreation in areas where there are wolves even though there are no documented attacks on humans in North America. Before reintroducing wolves, the USFWS examined several options or alternatives: (1) reintroduce wolveswith the wolves classified as \"experimental popula-tions\", (2) take no action\u2014allow wolves to naturallyexpand into Idaho and Yellowstone, (3) change lawsand prevent wolf recovery, (4) establish legislation forstates to implement wolf recovery with no federal over-sight, and (5) reintroduce with wolves classified asendangered.In an effort to address the concerns of local citizens,the reintroduced wolves in Yellowstone and centralIdaho were designated \"nonessential experimental\"populations under the Endangered Species Act. Thisclassification allows more involvement on the statelevel, broader flexibility in managing individual wolvesand the pack, and the use of management options thatwould not be permitted if the populations were classi-fied as endangered. Should the wolves pose a threat tolivestock, pets, or property, problem or nuisance wolvescan be relocated or, if necessary, killed by designatedpersonnel. In addition, when the wolf is classified as an \"experimental\" population, private landowners can injure or kill a wolf if it is caught in the act ofwounding or killing livestock on private land. Amid all of the publicity, issues, and controversies, wolves are returning to North America. The gray wolfpopulations in Montana, Yellowstone National Park,and central Idaho continue to grow and the easterntimber wolf populations in Minnesota continue tothrive. In the early 1990s, red wolves,* a smaller wolfspecies, were reintroduced into selected wild areas inNorth Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee. And in 1998,several family groups of the Mexican wolf, a subspeciesof the gray wolf, were released in the wilds along theArizona-New Mexico border. Now, there are someenvironmental groups examining the possibilities ofrestoring wolves to areas in the northeastern UnitedStates and southwestern Colorado. * Most scientists classify the red wolf as a distinct species of wolf. Others describe it as another subspeciesof the gray wolf.Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 100....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................

Information for the Back of the Critter Cards Willows We are shrubs that grow along the edges of streams and beaverponds. Our roots spread out andgrow deep. They help hold the soiland keep it from getting washedaway by floods. Bullsnakes We live in dry fields and aroundfarms. We like to eat small mammals like prairie dogs andother rodents. Although we cangrow to be very big (eight feetlong and as thick as your leg),we are not venomous.Bats We are experts at eating flyinginsects. We swoop around and can eat thousands of flying insectsin one night! Some people arescared of us, but we aren't reallybad. Besides, we are active at nightwhen most people are asleep.Ladybugs We are very small, and we eat othersmall tasty bugs such as aphidsand scale insects.Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 110....................................................................................................Career CrittersSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Woodpeckers We live in forests. We peck out the insects that live under the barkof sick or dead trees. We also useour beaks to chip deep holes intotrees where we build our nests.Sometimes these holes are used by other birds, such as bluebirdsand nuthatches, for their nests.Our holes help to bring new varieties of birds into the forest. Peregrine Falcons We are hawk-like birds that arebuilt for speed. We live and nestnear high cliffs, canyon walls, andeven skyscrapers. We catch smallerbirds to eat. Ecosystems with steepwalls and plenty of birds can begood places for us.Grasses We grow fast, and our roots helpkeep soil from blowing away in thewind and washing away in the rain.We are often the first plants togrow where the soil has been disturbed, and we can tolerate longperiods with little water.Beavers Using our big front teeth, we cutdown trees and shrubs, chew theminto smaller sticks, and build smalldams. These dams help to slowdown the water in streams andmake deep pools. Our dams help to slow small floods.Information for the Back of the Critter Cards\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 111....................................................................................................Career CrittersSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Squirrels In the autumn, we collect acorns from oak trees and store them to eat in winter. Sometimes we hide our acorns underground. Theonly problem is we collect so manyacorns that sometimes we forgetwhere we 've buried them! Some of these acorns sprout and grow intotall trees. Meadowlarks We are robin-sized birds that live in fields and on farms. We areknown for our beautiful song and the black \"V\"on our chests. Many people don't know we like to eat many insects.Trees Trees do many good things for the environment. Our roots help to hold soil in place. We provideshade and keep areas cool. Ourleaves help clear the air of somekinds of pollution.Gambusia Fish We enjoy the nice warm waters of ponds and lakes. One reason isthat mosquitoes do, too! A femaleadult mosquito lays her eggs in the water. The eggs hatch into wig-gly worm-like animals that stayunderwater. Eventually, they turninto flying mosquitoes. It's thoseunderwater mosquito wigglers thatwe love to eat!Information for the Back of the Critter CardsProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 112....................................................................................................Career CrittersSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................

Prairie Questionnaire Name: __________________________________________________________________________________ Here are 10 statements about how prairies might be used. Read each one, and then circle the number on the scale that best describes your feelings. 1. We need more cropland to feed the world 's growing population. 2. The importance of prairies in U.S. history is a poor reason to preserve them. 3. Farmers should be allowed to drain and farm prairie potholes if they need the money instead of farming around them. 4. Wildlife species that depend on prairies are no longer important. 5. If a landowner can make more money by building houses on a prairie than by preserving it,then it is all right to build houses. 6. Prairies are not needed to prevent soil erosion and protect water quality. 7. Because Native Americans no longer depend on the prairie ecosystem and its wildlife, prairies do not need to be preserved. 8. The scenic beauty of the prairie should not be considered when deciding to develop or preserve a prairie. 9. Prairies make excellent sites for farming and development because they are generally flat and thus should be used for those purposes. 10. Prairies should be farmed even if they are rocky ........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree 12 3 4 strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagreeProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 118....................................................................................................From Bison to Bread: The American PrairieSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................

Dear Diary: The sun rose to a cloudless sky and what seemed to be an endless sea of waving grass. It has been 3 days since we left the secure and bustling city ofIndependence. The prairie goes on forever, as far as the eye can see. Our journey would be simple if we could sail across the tops of the hills, but for every hilltop there is a val-ley. We travel the ridgetops as long as we can, but thenwe must travel down into the valley, only to have theoxen pull the wagon to the top of another hill. I've found that it is much easier to walk than ride in the jolting wagon. Walking away from the wagon train,I can enjoy the songs of the birds\u2014the sharp whistle of a partridge, the chirp of a lark, or the croaking of araven in the distant woods. The birds' songs are mixedwith the whirl of insect wings as they sail from oneclump of grass to another. I now recognize five different types of grasses, but the wildflowers will take much longer. The wildflowersmake the prairie look like a floral tapestry, woven with threads of yellow, white, blue, lavender, and pink.Along our path today, we encountered many streams,or perhaps it was the same one that kept crossing ourpath. Most have been shallow, not more than a footdeep. It is the 3 and 4 feet deep crossings that cause usto stop, unload the wagon, cross, and reload. We did not stop today until after 2 o'clock. The prairie provided us with entertainment. Three very large blackbirds with red heads soared tirelessly for more than anhour. Not one flapped a wing the entire time. The only shelter from the sun is under my bonnet, which has been hard to keep on because of the constantwind. The only other shade is from the occasional treesfound along the streams. Cottonwood, elm, and some-times a bur oak offer some relief. We found little firewood for tonight's cook fire and will have to resort to a cold dinner. I hope we find firewoodon tomorrow's journey. We made 12 miles today. I hopewe can continue to make good progress. \u2014Nellie Morgan, June 6, 1855Readings from Lonesome Prairie Dear Diary: I can't believe that when I agreed to marry Fred, I would have to leave my home at the corner of 6th andJames and move to the farm. From my front steps, Icould see the front doors of six of my best girlfriends,and the corner drug store was only two blocks away. But not here\u2014I am in the middle of the prairie. Our closest neighbors are the Humphreys, a half mile to theeast, and the Floyds are just over a mile to the south.From my front steps, the only thing I can see is waveafter wave of waist-high wheat. Out the back door isthe barn and the corral full of Holsteins waiting fortheir 4 o'clock milking. In the afternoons between chores, I've been reading Fred's family history. This farm has been in his familyfor more than 100 years. His great-grandmother, NellieMorgan, was traveling west with her family when theirwagon broke down. Having no materials to fix it ormoney to buy a new one, they decided to stake a claimhere in Harvey County.They first tried ranching but soon turned to growingwheat. Mennonite immigrants from Russia arrived inthe area in the 1870s, bringing with them the droughtresistant \"Turkey Red\" wheat. This plant foreverchanged the face of the prairie. Acres and acres of nativeprairie were plowed under to plant wheat, turning the\"Great American Desert\" into the nation's breadbasket. Even though I've seen it many times before, I'm still impressed by the wheat harvest. Every year in June and early July, the harvest moves north across the state.Wheat fields, which were planted the previous fall, havereached a golden ripeness. Huge combines move throughthe fields, making short work of what previously was alabor-consuming job. I need to get cleaned up and change clothes now. It's the Fourth of July, and there's a big celebration in towntonight. There'll be watermelon and hamburgers to eat,games, and a fireworks show. Maybe I'll see some of myhigh school friends. \u2014Linda Yoder, July 4, 1969........................................................................................................\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 121....................................................................................................A Picture Is Worth a Thousand WordsSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Background Text for Photos Photo 1: Market Hunters Market hunters exploited bison, antelope, deer and elk to meet the demands brought to thewest by the mining boom. By the mid-1870s,market hunting had nearly wiped out the bisonherds. By 1900, elk and deer populations weremoving toward a similar fate. Photo 2: Denver Market This photograph was taken at the O. J. Mungerand Company Wholesale Food Market at thecorner of 16th and Market in downtownDenver, Colorado, in the late 1800s. EarlyDenver needed wild game to feed its expandingpopulation. How have meat markets changed? Photo 3: Moose Hunter Moose populations were limited in the westbetween 1860 and 1978. However, conservationefforts between 1978 and 1986 proved moresuccessful. This photo shows a scene from amoose hunt in 1985 when 500 people appliedfor licenses to take part in this opportunity.Compare this photo to Photo 1. What changesin policy and technology have occurred? Photo 4: Modern Hunter According to the Congressional Sportsman'sFoundation, more people hunt and fish in theUnited States than attend National LeagueFootball, Major League Baseball, and NationalHockey League games combined. Spending byhunters and anglers exceeds all U.S. exports ofcoal, corn, cigarettes, soybeans, meat, lumber,and metal ore combined. Fortune magazine estimates the economic impact of hunting is $10 billion annually. The funding for wildlifeprograms and services to support state parks and forests often does not come from statetaxes. In Colorado, for example, more than 80 percent of the budget for wildlife programsand services is derived from selling hunting andfishing licenses, with the remainder coming fromfederal funding.Photo 5: Confiscated Elk, 1930 By the early 1900s, state legislatures started topass laws\u2014including those establishing huntingand fishing license programs\u2014to protect gameanimals. In this photo, the items on the wagonare hides of 441 illegally hunted elk. Regulationsare a tool wildlife biologists use to conservewildlife populations. Photo 6: Confiscated Wildlife, 1989 Poaching continues to be a problem faced by state fish and wildlife agencies. This photoshows animals seized in 1989. This undercoveroperation was established to catch poachers and involved 275 wildlife officers from fivestates. Nearly 50 individuals were implicated by this operation. Photo 7: First Fish Hatchery In 1881, natural resource agencies were operating hatcheries like this one that stockedfish in streams. Compare this photograph withPhoto 8. Photo 8: Modern Fish Hatchery The Rifle Falls Hatchery in Colorado becamethe largest state-owned hatchery in the world in1955. Fish and wildlife management practicesinvolve inventorying and monitoring populationsand the propagation of species for stocking andreintroduction. Photo 9: Fish Stocking Horses carrying buckets and cream cans filledwith fish were used to stock high mountainlakes at the turn of the 20th century. Comparethis photo with Photos 10, 11, and 12. Photo 10: Helicopter Since the 1950s, airplanes, and more recentlyhelicopters, have been used to stock fish intohigh mountain lakes. In this photo, a biologiststocks trout fry in a high mountain lake.Project WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 122....................................................................................................A Picture Is Worth a Thousand WordsSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Photo 11: Early Fish-Stocking Truck This photo shows one of the earliest models of fish-stocking trucks. Photo 12: Modern Fish Stocking Truck This photo shows a modern-day fish stockingtruck used by wildlife agencies for transportingand stocking fish. To keep the fish alive, eachtank must have a constant flow of oxygenpumped into the water. Water temperature is regulated to reduce stress on fish. Photo 13 and 14: Live Trapping Elk Many techniques have been used to track migration patterns of elk and other big game.One of the most effective ways to study wildlifemovement is to tag the animals. Handling wildanimals is always a difficult, and sometimes dan-gerous, task. These photos demonstrate capturetechniques from two very different eras. In thelate 1800s, the capture was done rodeo style. Inthe more recent photo, a biologist jumps on acow elk from a helicopter. The deep snow cush-ions both the person and the animal. Othertechniques include the use of tranquilizer gunsand large corral-type traps. Each technique hasits positive and negative aspects. The safety ofthe animal and the safety of the biologist arealways the most important issues when choosinga technique to study wild animals. Photo 15: Early Fish Biologists In the 1920s, fish eggs were collected from productive lakes and transported back to thehatchery. These men are preparing the eggs for transport.Photo 16: Modern Fish Biologist A researcher examines fish in the stress tunnelat a research lab. Technology changes influenceenvironmental management decisions by allow-ing more sophisticated science-based analysis.Compare this photo to Photo 15. Photo 17: Watching Wildlife The Watchable Wildlife Program began duringthe 1980s. Wildlife agencies are making effortsto fund programs that focus more on viewingwildlife (nonconsumptive uses such as canoeing,hiking, bird watching, etc.) than harvesting (consumptive uses such as hunting, fishing,trapping). Photo 18: Development The biggest challenge facing most wildlife biologists today is the loss of wildlife habitat because of human population growth. Wildlifehabitat is disappearing as habitat is convertedinto developments and agricultural production.Although regulations are a necessary tool, pro-tection and restoration of habitat are consideredto be the most successful and cost-effectivelong-term techniques for managing wildlifespecies. Photo 19: Wildlife Education Education became an important wildlife management tool in the 1990s. The more people know about the needs of wildlife, themore likely they will be willing to share theircommunities with wildlife.\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 123....................................................................................................A Picture Is Worth a Thousand WordsSustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................Step 1.

Deer Dilemma Crystal Lake Park is an 850-acre multiple use park in Suburbanville, USA. The park has severalsoccer fields, a baseball complex, and a 6-acrelake used for fishing and canoeing. There is anice picnic area adjacent to the lake. Naturetrails exist around the lake, and the upper end of the lake is composed of a small wetlandrenowned for its excellent bird watching. Severalnature trails exist in the forested portion of thepark, but approximately 600 acres of the parkland is seldom, if ever, entered by park visitors.The park is bordered on the southern and east-ern sides by subdivisions. To the west lies the last remaining farm in this portion of thecounty. The Wolfpack River bounds the north-ern portion of the area. Residents of the subdivisions, along with Charlie Fields, the neighboring farmer, have petitionedthe local Board of Commissioners to do some-thing about the ever-increasing deer populationin the park. Mr. Fields currently allows huntingon his property but complains that the deer sim-ply move to the park when the hunting startsand that very few are taken by the hunters on his property during the hunting season.Incidentally, he has resorted to using out-of-sea-son nuisance animal permits to shoot the deer atnight while they are eating his crops.Mr. Fields does not like this option but feels hemust shoot the deer in order to keep his farmprofitable. The residents of the local communi-ties have tried everything from fencing andrepellants to feeding the deer in hopes of keep-ing the deer away from their flowers and out ofthe roads. Many residents are ready to use lethalcontrol in this area. However, the issue hasdivided the community, and arguments aboutwhat to do with the deer are common. Someresidents don't mind the deer and are willing to tolerate their presence. Many park visitors donot want the deer harmed in any way becausethey enjoy seeing the herds of deer grazing onthe soccer fields in the evenings as they drivethrough the park. The Board of Commissioners has called a public meeting to listen to the concerns of their con-stituents and ultimately to make a decision con-cerning this issue. State laws do not prohibithunting in this park, so the decision will need tobe made at the local level. The board has madeno decision as to what option or options (morethan one might be appropriate) to approve andhas convened this meeting to hear ideas fromtheir constituents.Student Pages Crystal Lake Park 's Deer Dilemma\u00a9 Council for Environmental Education 2004 131....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Deer Dilemma Charlie Fields Mr. Fields is a local farmer. His family has farmed this land for three generations, and he plans to pass thefarm along to his children. He grows mostly graincrops on his farm. For the past 5 years, he has experi-enced considerable loss from deer eating his crops.Mr. Fields leases the hunting rights on his farm to alocal group of hunters. The hunters have told Mr.Fields that they see very few deer during the huntingseason because they all appear to move into the park.Mr. Fields is frustrated and would like the county to open the park to hunting in order to reduce thedensity of deer. Dorothy Right Mrs. Right is a local attorney who lives in one of the adjacent subdivisions. Mrs. Right enjoys hiking in thepark during the evening hours with her two children.She is very concerned about the idea of huntingoccur-ring adjacent to their subdivision and doesn'twant any harm to come to her children. Mrs. Rightdoes not oppose the lethal removal of deer from thepark; she just wants to be sure things are done safelyand in the least conspicuous way possible. Michael Green Mr. Green is a resident of the local subdivision and is an avid gardener. His roses were once award-winningand the envy of his friends and neighbors. Now hisroses are food for the local deer herd. He is veryupset and has tried several forms of repellants andfences to no avail. Mr. Green hates the deer and sees no value in their presence. He is supportive ofremoving all deer from the park. Bob Stats Dr. Stats teaches environmental biology at the local university, where he also does research on wildlifepopulations and factors that affect populationchanges. He prefers monitoring the deer herd sizeannually and using a combination of managementtechniques tailored to the population size each year.Betty Bumper Ms. Bumper lives at the end of county road in an area that is quickly becoming developed with newhousing. Her work schedule demands that she be onthe road at sunrise and at dusk when the deer appearto be most active. Therefore, she has hit several deer,and her auto insurance has increased. She is support-ive of whatever means can be taken to diminish thenumber of deer in the area. Don Dearlove Mr. Dearlove is a member of an animal rights organization that believes that hunting of animals for any reason is cruel and unnecessary. He enjoysseeing deer in the area but is concerned about thepotential for accidents and about the health of thedeer herd. He feels local residents should use othermethods of control. Lynn Ranger Ms. Ranger is a park naturalist who can testify about the reduction in the understory plant diversity of thepark and how the population of deer has affected it.She has documented evidence that some rare plantsare declining in number and some animal species arebeing affected by the declining plant diversity. John Dodds Mr. Dodds's son contracted Lyme disease last year, and he blames the deer. He is in favor of any meansof removing the deer to diminish the threat of con-tracting this disease. Brad Arms Mr. Arms is one of the people who hunt on Charlie Fields's land. He believes that the best way to managethe deer herd is to allow regulated hunting in thepark. He also sees this as an opportunity to providehunter education to the community and to dispelsome of the misconceptions about hunting and deermanagement. He is willing to pay for the opportunityto hunt in the park and to donate a portion of theharvested meat to food shelters in the community.Role CardsProject WILD K -12 Curriculum and Activity Guide Student Pages 132....................................................................................................Sustaining Fish and Wildlife Resources........................................................................................................ Sustainability: Then, Now, Later How do we bring about changes in human behavior that result in actively protecting and preserving ournatural world? How can we repair damage to habi-tats and reduce damage in the future? Whatevermethods are used, most likely everyone will pay the costs. The questions that society must decideinvolve balancing the value of material wealth andthe value of environmental health. Until recently,that balance has favored production and consump-tion at the expense of natural resources because soci-ety has not understood nor put a price on the valueof a healthy environment. Placing a value on actionsnecessary to achieve and maintain a healthy environ-ment is important, because achieving it will costmoney. Producing goods in a way that does not damage the environment may initially result inhigher prices and fewer material goods, but we maybe willing to pay that price for a healthy world.Others argue that new technologies will be devel-oped that will help increase production withoutdamaging habitats. But such developments take timeand money, too, and may be short-sighted. If we are willing to pay for a healthy environment, it is the individual who will probably lead the fight.Although business and government are crucial deci-sion-making components driving the economy, politi-cians tend to act only when they're convinced thatthe voters want them to, and businesses producegoods and services that the public demands and willpay for. Sustainable change must be supported at theultimate grassroots level because it is our cumulativeindividual material needs and wants that generatethe production and economic activity that leads tothe use of our resources. For us to use limited resources most effectively and wisely, it will be important to distinguish \"needs\"from \"wants.\" Needs are necessities, or things wemust have. Wants are luxuries, or non-essential thingsthat we would like to have for enjoyment or conven-ience. The distinction between the two may varybetween individuals and even countries. What satis-fies as a basic need for shelter in one country, forexample, may be totally unacceptable in another.Perhaps because our economy does so well in meet-ing our basic needs, we are now able to focus on theenvironmental implications of our economic activity.We have tended to measure progress in terms of thequantity of goods and services, but now we are chal-lenged to consider the quality of life as well, and tovalue things that have not historically had a pricetag: a wilderness, a sparkling stream, clean air, and soon. Do we need more goods and services? Howmuch do we need?

Sustainability: Then, Now, Later Over the past century, we have managed ecosystems in at least five different ways. Until the middle ofthis century, the industrialized world tended to seethe environment as an infinite supply of resourcesand a bottomless sink for wastes. This first approach,often referred to as \"frontier economics,\" prevailseven today in some developing nations and somesectors of industrialized countries. The economy was seen to exist in almost complete isolation,separate from the environment. Resources were seen as being abundant. So, for example, an increaseddemand for forest products could be met simply by building a new mill. The more pressing problemwith frontier economics was the scarcity of workers,not of resources. Consequently, the destruction ofthe environment made little difference, because freshterritory and fresh resources always were withinreach. It also can be argued that a further conse-quence of the frontier economics approach was thedevelopment of separate sciences. Forests or crops,for example, never were considered in relation to thesoil that held them in place, to the rivers that ranthrough them, or to the animals that lived withinthem. Government programs, university faculties,and economic theories all perpetuated this rather unconnected and restrictive outlook on the world. By the late 1960s and 1970s, many people in indus- trialized nations began to recognize the interdepend-ence of man and the environment, and they becameincreasingly concerned about pollution. Although the environment continued to be less important than economics, the need to conserve and maintainresource stocks became a consideration for the firsttime. During this period policies were introduced tomake polluters more accountable for the damagethey caused and the relationship among land, soil,water, air, and animal life was made a factor withinthe traditional sciences. Under this second approach,known as \"resource management,\" the environmentalimplications of resource removal was evaluated.These assessments, however, often were made as anafterthought, following the planning stages of a givendevelopment project. Consequently, business deci-sion-making processes continued largely as before,with environmental consequences considered afterthe basic decisions were made.Resource management remains, to a large extent, thedominant mode of thinking about the environmentand economic development. Nevertheless, environ-mental awareness is growing at an increasingly rapidpace. \"Selective environmentalism,\" a third approach,reflects a contrasting style of thinking. It can best be described as a \"doing my part\" approach, whereconsumers and agencies express their concerns aboutenvironmental degradation by making selectedefforts to stop it. This desire to do something for the environment has led to many \"environmentallyfriendly\" products and initiatives, such as municipalrecycling programs. However, selective environmen-talism places little, if any, emphasis on cost-effective-ness. Moreover, it makes the assumption that theeconomy will simply take care of itself. \"Deep environmentalism,\" the fourth approach, disavows economics to the furthest degree. Here,the human race is seen as no more than one of manyspecies that share this planet. Clearly, deep environ-mentalism is the antithesis of frontier economics.Where frontier economics gave little attention to the environment, deep ecology gives little attentionto the economy. The most balanced approach considers \"sustainable communities.\" This fifth outlook supports the viewthat a healthy environment is essential for a soundand prosperous economy. Society, economics, and the environment are, therefore, seen as elements of a mutually supporting ecosystem and are automati-cally taken into account before decisions are made.A sustainable community approach holds thatresources must be treated on the basis of theirfuture, as well as their present, value. With today'sunprecedented threats of global change and world-wide degradation of environmental resources, theneed to integrate environmental, social, and econom-ic goals in the broader ecological context has neverbeen greater.
