Upon arrival it was explained to me the exact costs and what my insurance would cover and what may be out of pocket. The exam was excellent and my first adjustment felt great. For each part of the adjustment everything was explained to me (here is what I am doing and here is why). It felt extremely comfortable. This was my first chiropractic visit and I will be back to finish my treatment and will likely make this a regular monthly visit. Highly recommend.\" \"Very pleased with first time experience with chiropractor! Dr Jamie took time to listen and thoroughly explained what she thought and also what she was going to do. She made me feel very comfortable. Very professional with great demeanor!\" \"I love Back to Natural!! I've seen Dr. Jamie now for several months on and off for back stiffness and reduced movement as needed. She is so attentive and listens deeply so she can provide recommended adjustments or treatment as needed. I always feel welcome when I visit and love this small private practice.\" \"I had problems with severe pain in my neck.

Dr. Molnar was one of the top recommended chiropractors in-network on my insurance page, so I went with her. I'm glad I did. After just 1 visit, I could turn my neck to the left 45-degrees (I couldn't turn it to the left at all beforehand). A couple visits later, and the inflammation is almost gone, and I have full turning range of my neck! She also noticed that areas of my back were out of line, so she adjusted them back to normal position. Dr. Molnar is amazing!\" \"Great experience! Dr. Molnar was so kind and willing to listen to me as a patient. She explained everything she was doing so that I was prepared. Instead of making a big long plan for treatment, she is taking it visit by visit. It was a great experience and I would highly "}
