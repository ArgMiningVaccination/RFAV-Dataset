How Our Integrative Approach Heals Your Mind, Body & Spirit By Dr. Andrea Palmer, Director of Medical Services Arizona Addiction Treatment Center Holistic & Naturopathic Therapy At The River Source, we believe that using natural, self-healing treatments in combination with medical care is the best way to heal the damage your body has suffered from substance abuse. By using naturopathic therapy during detox and along the various steps of your journey to recovery, we're helping you adopt alternative treatments that will address all aspects of your mind, body, and spirit. Here are some of the naturopathic therapy treatments that are included or available for purchase during detox, inpatient, and outpatient rehab: Nutritional Treatments Substance abuse can affect your body in multiple ways, and most commonly, it offsets your body's chemical balance. At The River Source Arizona rehab center, we've designed programs to address these nutritional deficits so that we can restore a healthy balance to your body. IV & Oral Vitamin Therapy Addiction is extremely destructive on the body and its systems, and it's common that clients will enter treatment with vitamin and mineral deficiencies that harm the way their bodies function. At The River Source, we'll help you restore your body's delicate systems as quickly as possible by supplementing it with the natural vitamins and minerals it needs. - (IV) Intravenous Therapy - Mg, Calcium, Zinc, B & C - B12 Injections - Reduce Withdrawal Symptoms - Orals, Powder & Drops for Optimal Results Amino Acid Therapy Our brains relay information between neurons using electrical signals. However, abusing drugs or alcohol can affect the volume of these signals, changing how we perceive, think, feel, and act. When you stop abusing the substance that has affected your neurotransmitters, it's possible to feel depressed or anxious. Increasing your neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, can combat these feelings. This is accomplished by replacing amino acids, which we can provide to you through an IV or orally during your treatment at The River Source. - Balance Anxiety & Depression - Increase Energy, Less Fatigue - Restored Mental Health Physical Treatments A major part of detox and ongoing addiction treatment is gradually rebuilding your physical strength. We offer various physical outlets and therapies that provide you with a means to continue healing your body and improve its performance. With a healthy body and more balanced system, you'll have the strength and energy needed to focus on the next step in your recovery - healing your mind and spirit. Massage Therapy At The River Source, we offer multiple massage modalities performed by certified therapists, such as deep tissue massage. Massage and physical manipulation can help stabilize clients and alleviate some of the muscle soreness, fatigue, and pain that is so often a symptom of withdrawal. Massage is a therapeutic and rejuvenating therapy that allows you relax, breathe, and work out your tensions without having to verbally communicate them out loud. - Naturally Releases More Dopamine & Serotonin - Decreases Stress Hormones Such as Cortisol - Improves Sleeping Patterns Yoga & Meditative Therapy During our guided yoga classes, you can increase your flexibility, endurance, and muscle strength as well as increase your ability to harness and circulate your body's energy. Meditative therapies such as yoga aim to help clients in detox stay strong, reduce the power of cravings, and improve focus. However, the benefits of yoga go beyond just helping improve your physical body. Yoga is also a mental activity, that with discipline, can allow you to attain complete self-realization. Many clients at The River Source find that some of their best reflection on themselves and their recovery occur during meditative therapy sessions. - Stimulates New Cells in Brain for Memory & Cognition - Breathing Exercises that Calm Nerves & Reduce Stress - Spiritual Benefits that Enhance Inner Peace Dry Infrared Sauna Therapy Long term substance abuse will build up a concentration of toxins that need to be flushed out during detox. When used in combination with other holistic rehab therapies, dry sauna is an effective method to help clients rapidly sweat out these negative particles. At The River Source, our sauna is a client favorite because, not only does it provide a comfortable physical detox, it's also a peaceful place to meditate and relax. The heat of the infrared sauna provides a warming, calming effect that allows time for introspection as well as emotional and physical healing. - Removes Drug & Environmental Toxins from Body - Safe, Natural, No Side Effects - Improves Cardiovascular Function & Overall Wellness About Naturopathic Therapy in Arizona Drug Rehabs Near Phoenix The River Source has three drug and alcohol rehab centers conveniently located between Phoenix and Tucson.
