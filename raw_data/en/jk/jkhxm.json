[People under 20 years of age](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/free-catch-up-vaccines-for-10-to-19-year-olds-fact-sheet) and all [refugee and humanitarian entrants](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/free-catch-up-vaccines-for-refugees-and-humanitarian-entrants-aged-20-years-and-over-fact-sheet) are eligible for free catch up of age appropriates vaccines on the [National Immunisation Program Schedule (NIP)](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule%E3%2A). Catch-up to HPV vaccine is available for people under 26 years of age. Catch-up vaccines should be provided as quickly as possible to provide optimal protection and all vaccines given in Australia or overseas should be entered onto the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). There are a range of resources available to assist immunisation providers plan catch-up schedules: Catch-up vaccination - Adolescents (Schools program) [Adolescents in Years 7 and 10](https://health.act.gov.au/services-and-programs/immunisation/adolescents) who missed receiving a vaccine at school during the school health team visit, can be given a free catch up dose at any time after the missed dose. - Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (dTpa) (Year 7). - Meningococcal ACWY (Year 10). - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (Year 7). Adverse Events Following Immunisation An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is an unwanted or unexpected event following immunisation that may be related to the vaccine itself, its handling or administration, or may occur by coincidence, that is, regardless of the vaccine. Vaccines may produce some unwanted side effects which are mostly mild and clear up quickly. Providing your clients with the [Following vaccination - what to expect and what to do](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/following-vaccination-what-to-expect-and-what-to-do) handout, alerts parents to these common side effects and how to treat them. A very small number of people may have more serious reaction. These may include anaphylaxis, seizures and severe rash. It is not possible to identify every individual who might have a mild or serious reaction to a vaccine, although there are a few contraindications to some vaccines. By following recommendations on who and who should not receive particular vaccines, health practitioners minimise the risk of their patient's having serious adverse effects from vaccination. More information can be found in the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/). Surveillance of AEFI provides ongoing monitoring to detect population specific, rare or late onset adverse events not detected in in pre-licensure clinical trials. In the ACT, Adverse events following immunisation are notifiable under the [ACT Public Health Act 1997: Public Health (Reporting of Notifiable Conditions) Code of Practice 2017 (No 1).](https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/1997-69/current/PDF/1997-69.PDF) In the ACT, suspected AEFI should be reported to the Immunisation Unit, Health Protection Service using the [Immunisation Adverse Event Reporting Form (online form)](https://actredcap.act.gov.au/redcap/surveys/?s=XD9DEYFHW7), or by contacting the Health Protection Service, Immunisation Unit on [(02) 5124 9800](tel:0251249800). If you would prefer to print out a form to fax or email to us, please [click here](https://www.health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-03/Adverse%20Event%20Following%20Immunisation.pdf). The Immunisation Unit reports all notifications to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction System (ADRS) at the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Australia-wide annual reports on AEFI surveillance are published by the Australian Government. For more information see the following links: Special Immunisation Clinic The Special Immunisation Clinic (SIC) is held monthly at the Paediatric Day Stay Unit in the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children. Referrals can be made by medical practitioners using the [Special Immunisation Clinic Referral Form.](https://www.health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-07/Immunisation%20-%20Special%20immunisation%20clinic%20referral.pdf) To be eligible, referrals must be for: - vaccines funded under the National Immunisation Program (NIP) and - children 16 years of age or younger AND meet at least one of the following criteria: - previous serious adverse event following immunisation (as determined by Public Health Physician or Public Health Registrar) - anaphylaxis to previous vaccine (or vaccine component) - high risk of adverse reaction post vaccination due to medical conditions. People with egg allergy (including anaphylaxis) can safely receive MMR vaccine in any setting. People with egg allergy can safely receive influenza vaccine in any setting. People with egg anaphylaxis should be vaccinated in a medical facility with staff experienced in recognising and treating anaphylaxis. Australian Immunisation Register Recording of vaccinations The documentation of all vaccine doses administered must be electronically entered on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) to maintain accurate health records and to monitor vaccine coverage rates. ACT Health requires data on influenza doses administered by providers completing the [influenza vaccine record form](https://cms.health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-05/Vaccines%20-%20Influenza%20record%20form.docx) as this informs: - Priority groups receiving/ not receiving vaccines; and - assists with targeted communication for priority groups that have lower uptake of these vaccines. Information to assist with vaccine recording: Rabies and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) post exposure prophylaxis Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal or by direct contact of the virus with mucosa (nose, eyes and mouth). ABLV is closely related to rabies and all Australian bats have the potential to carry lyssavirus. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease which is nearly always fatal. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is recommended for those travelling to [Rabies prone areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-risks-by-country/rabies-risks-in-terrestrial-animals-by-country), as well as for those who work in an at-risk occupation such as bat-handlers and veterinarians. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be commenced as soon as possible following exposure, although there is no time limit. If a person has been bitten or scratched by a bat anywhere in the world, or by an animal in a [rabies endemic country](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-risks-by-country/rabies-risks-in-terrestrial-animals-by-country), complete the [Rabies/Australian Bat Lyssavirus Post Exposure Prophylaxis Form](https://health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-05/Rabies%20and%20Australian%20Bat%20Lyssavirus%20Post%20Exposure%20Prophylaxis.docx) and contact the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) section urgently to assess whether post exposure prophylaxis is needed. During business hours phone (02) 5124 9800 or after (02) 9962 4155 to page the on-call officer. Post exposure management will depend on the extent of the exposure, the animal source, the person's immune system and their vaccination history. A post-exposure course of rabies vaccine and a one-off dose of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) may be recommended to prevent infection. Vaccine and Human Rabies Immunoglobulin and should be administered as per the rabies section of the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/). Please complete and return [PEP treatments forms](https://health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-05/Rabies%20and%20Australian%20Bat%20Lyssavirus%20Post%20Exposure%20Prophylaxis.docx) to fax 5124 9307 or email to [immunisation@act.gov.au](mailto:immunisation@act.gov.au) after administering treatment. Useful links: Other things to consider Yellow Fever People aged 1 year or over must have an [International certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis ](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-bio-yellow-fever.htm)if they have stayed overnight or longer in a declared yellow fever-infected country within 6 days before arriving in (or returning to) Australia. Some countries require yellow fever vaccination for travellers having transited through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. [List of countries with yellow fever transmission and countries requiring yellow fever vaccination](https://www.who.int/ith/2016-ith-annex1.pdf?ua=1). Healthcare professionals provide this certificate at the time of vaccination. The certificate is valid for the duration of the life of the person and begins 10 days after vaccination. Yellow fever vaccine must be given by an approved yellow fever vaccination centre. Medical practices wishing to become an approved centre must meet the minimum requirements set out in the [National Guidelines for Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres and Providers](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/D60F275C45BDEBBACA25833500790582/$File/Guidelines-Yellow-Fever-Vaccination-Centres.pdf).
