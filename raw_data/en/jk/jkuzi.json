You may have noticed that we're making huge strides in destigmatizing mental illness, and that's fantastic. The importance of treating your mental health as you would your physical health is a pretty well accepted principle. It's becoming less taboo to talk openly about therapy and mental illness\u2014there are almost as many celebrities talking about mental health as there are Keep Calm and Whatever decorations in literally any store you walk into. All signs point to the fact that we're prioritizing self care, and that's awesome. But when it comes to actually being mentally well, we're a little murky on the follow-through. There's no shortage of self-care strategies out there, but not everyone has the time and money to spend on a wellness retreat or horse therapy or crystals that may or may not chill you out. This year, on World Mental Health Day, we've culled some of the most impactful and least intimidating ways to take care of your mental health so that it becomes something we do\u2014not just something we talk about. You know when you need one, and you know you'll be more productive (and just generally easier to be around) if you take one. So why do we all feel so selfish when we do it?

For a lot of people, zoning out with a good series can be a therapeutic coping mechanism, which is great, but it's helpful to find other tools for calming down at the end of the day. And maybe you'll find one that won't occasionally keep you up until 2 a.m. Read more at [I Challenged Myself to Read a Book a Week And it Made a Huge Impact on My Health](https://www.self.com/story/read-a-book-a-week-health-benefits). We tend to have a more chill outlook on everything when we're on vacation. You replace the gym with swimming and walking, dinner consists of potlucks with new friends, and your email (hopefully) has an out-of-office reply. What if we took just a little bit of that mentality and made it the rule\u2014rather than the exception? Maybe that means skipping the gym to go for a simple run in the park, or turning your phone on Do Not Disturb between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Obviously it won't make you feel like you're on vacation, but it might help you reclaim your time.
