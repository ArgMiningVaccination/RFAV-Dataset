I never had enough energy, I struggled to lose weight, I had a tendency toward depression; to put it mildly I was extremely frustrated. I'd go to my doctor and tell him about my fatigue, my depression and my inability to lose weight.

However, instead of treating a patient with medications that suppress symptoms, I work to find out what is causing the undesirable conditions. By exploring your specific symptoms and body/organ/gland conditions during your consultation, much can be learned about how your body is expressing nutritional deficiencies, the need to detoxify, weakened organ/glands, sensitivity to foods, emotional issues and more. Once this is understood it is often easy to explain how and why such negative symptoms and diseases have surfaced in the body.
