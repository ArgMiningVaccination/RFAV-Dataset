This video will help health care providers get up to date on key information regarding the [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations). National guidelines are recommending prioritizing giving the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) to the public according to a person's status as an essential worker and their risk of becoming ill from [COVID-19](/learn/COVID-19:_Nursing). Based on these criteria, they have identified different categories/segments. The first category, called Phase 1a, is where residents of long-term care facilities and front-line healthcare workers, including first responders will be [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity), [22]. Next is Phase 1b, where essential workers and adults aged 75 and over will be [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) [22]. In Phase 1c, adults aged 65 and over, as well as patients at high-risk for severe [COVID-19](/learn/COVID-19:_Nursing) infection caused by pre-existing health conditions will be [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity). In Phase 2, everyone 16 years of age or older who hasn't received a [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) will be eligible to receive one. These national recommendations continue to evolve and may change over time, however, it's ultimately up to each state to decide how [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) will be distributed. Currently there are two [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The first is BNT172b2. It was created by BioNTech, Fosun Pharma, and Pfizer and is colloquially called the \"Pfizer [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations)\". It's an mRNA [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) that must be stored long-term in -112 to -76 fahrenheit, or -80 to -60 celsius. [MRNA vaccines](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology) differ from traditional [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) as they cause our [body](/answers/fruiting-body-of-aspergillus) to manufacture the spike protein of the virus we're trying to protect against, instead of introducing remnants of the virus itself. Once thawed and diluted, vials can be stored in a refrigerator for 6 hours. Initially, these vials were reported to hold 5 doses per vial, however, it has been discovered each vial contains 6 usable doses and official [documentation](/learn/Documentation_and_reporting) has been updated. People receiving this [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) should receive two intramuscular doses of 0.3mL of diluted [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations), 3 weeks apart.
