Our mission is to eliminate the cancer burdens of Indigenous people through im proved access to prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivor support. American Indian Cancer Burden Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Cancer Coalition The National Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Cancer Coalition seeks to red uce the burden of cancer among urban American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities nationwide. To achieve this mission, the coalition works collaboratively with diverse stakeholders with shared interest and goals. Working together, the coalition wi ll advance health systems change processes, identify culturally -tailored evidence -based intervention practices, and set AI/AN cancer goals. Urban Indian Health Programming According to the United States Census, 71% of AI/AN s live in urban areas. Reflecti ve of this growing trend, 41 Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHPs) have been established nationwide. UIHPs provide a culturally appropriate place for urban AI/ANs to receive health and social services and engage in cultural activities. Clinics within UIHPs vary by the number of direct primary care offers they offer. Comprehensive clinics provide 40 hours of direct primary care services per week, limited clinics provide less than 40 hours per week, and outreach and referral sites do not provide any on site di rect care services. Instead, outreach and referral sites refer patients to external health care providers. (Urban Indian Health Institute, 2016 ). As cancer is the number one cause of death among AI/AN women and the second leading cause of death among AI/AN men, these 41 UIHPs have a greater potential to more effectively 3 reach AI/AN cancer survivors and address their cancer -related health outcomes throug hout the cancer continuum (Emerson et al., 2017). ABOUT THIS CANCER PLAN The cancer continuum outlines the various stages in cancer care and control: primary prevention, screening and early detection, treatment, survivorship, and palliative and end -of- life care. The cancer plan is broken up into six sections that address the cancer continuum and the cross -cutting issue of health equity. Each section provides an overarching goal, objective, and list of potential strategies across the cancer continuum. T he baseline and target measures have been provided where applicable. This cancer plan was established in 2020 with goals continuing into 2022 to help address health equity in Indian Country. We plan to revise these goals in 2023. The purpose of the cance r plan is to: Highlight and raise awareness about the important cancer issues, challenges, and barriers faced by urban AI/AN communities Set goals and objectives for improvement across the cancer continuum Propose potential strategies to achieve goals and objectives Draw together a diverse group of stakeholders Long Term Goals Reduce the incidence and mortality rates for all cancers in urban AI/AN communities Increase appropriate cancer screening through recommended screenable cancer guidelines in urban AI/A N communities Reduce the rate of late -stage diagnosis in urban AI/A N communities Increase understanding and practice of cultural humility in UIHP staff 4 Increase data surveillance efforts to be complete and accurate to urban AI/AN communities Improve the quality of life for urban AI/AN cancer survivors and their caregivers About the Data Accurate reporting and data collection is paramount to the improvement of cancer care and control as a means to me asure such things as incidence, mortality and survival rates. These are three areas that have been identified as areas of improvement needed to address data surveillance and reporting. First, much of the baseline data needed for such calculations is either not specific to the AI/AN population due to small sampling sizes, causing a form of erasure in national, regional, and state level data thus not allowing to capture year to year changes in important benchmarks. Secondly, data that is specific to the urban AI/AN population is simply nonexistent. And finally, calculating rates becomes even more complicated when factoring only multiple racial and ethnic statises in conjunction with AI/AN. This is important to note because AI/AN people have the largest proport ion of any racial group that identify as multi -racial, and excluding those who identify as multi -racial is another form of erasure. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Support for this project was made possible by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1NU5 8DP006277 -01-00). Findings, content, and conclusions are contributions from a diverse group of stakeholders and do not represent the official position of the CDC.

Equity is the absence of avoidable, unfair, or remediable differences among people, and this ideal is not a reality for AI/ANs in health. AI/AN people have the right to access quality, timely, and affordable health care . Where people live, learn, work, and play can affect their health risks and the outcomes associated. These conditions are known as social determinants of health. Our AI/AN ancestors were some of the healthiest people, after colonization those health outcomes changed drastically. The determinants of Indigneous health (DOIH) recognize the experience of colonization and historical and ongoing trauma that AI/AN people face can lead to adverse health outcomes. These disparities are affected by historical and ongoing trauma and systemic practices that deeply affect individual, family, and community health and wellbeing. At the root of these disparities are laws and policies that criminalize AI/AN cultural and traditional practices, while also effectively dehuma nizing AI/AN people through genocide, forced removal from ancestral and ceremonial homelands, termination, and assimiliation. Adverse health outcomes include high rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression and other mental health problems, early m ortality rates, and high rates of infant and maternal mortality. Another contributing factor to current AI/AN health disparities is the lack of data and tribal data sovereignty. This lack in available data is due to research and surveillance entities that withhold publishing data, due to small population sizes. In order to reduce cancer burdens for AI/ANs, health equity must be prioritized through practices and interventions that are informed and represented by urban AI/AN communities. Potential Barriers /Challenges Misclassification of AI/AN populations in data collection (e.g. birth certificates, death certificates) Lack of funding Fear of doctors and health systems caused by historical and/or sexual trauma Lack of native health care staff Shortage of cancer care expertise Burnout of health care staff Cultural sensitivity & competency Health Equity Goal: Decrease cancer disparities for urban AI/AN community members through policy, systems, and environmental changes.

AI/AN traditions nurture sustainability, interrelatedness, a non -linear perspective of time, respect for all living things, balance, and lifeways rooted in culture. These values form the basis of cultural -based disease prevention wh ich includes traditional medicines, a natural diet, a connection to nature, community, traditions, physical activity, and rest. Systemic efforts to p rimary cancer prevention reduces or eliminates the risk of cancer. In 2020, more than 1.8 million p eople wi ll be diagnosed with cancer in the United States. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer is lowered. Following our ancestral lifeways and improving c ultural based disease prevention will reduce the burden of cancer and lower the number of deaths caused by cancer ( National Cancer Institute ). Behavioral change is not the only factor to consider on this healing journey. The places we live can be determinants of how we learn, work, exercise, and eat; influences within our environments are what determine if a person, family, or community is health y. Potential Barriers/Challenges Limited prevention and education related services available, especially those that are culturally competent Staff capacity to provide education Public health funding Lack of culturally tailored educational materials and tools Accessibility to commercial tobacco products (e.g. cigarettes, e -cigarettes, chewing tobacco) AI/AN targeted marketing by commercial tobacco companies Inadequate knowledge and acceptable use of tr aditional tobacco practices Increase of sedentary lifestyle and poor diet (e.g. lack of fresh fruits and vegetables) Limited access to outdoor or recreational spaces Food deserts Unaffordability of healthy food options Different electronic health records systems are not able to effectively transfer client health records to ensure timely prevention Increased exposure to environmental carcinogens (e.g. UV rays, radon) Primary Prevention Goal: Promote healthy lifeways among urban AI/ANs to reduce risk of cancer.

In our traditional ways, the body is sacred and we are meant to honor that by maintaining and being proactive with our health. In addition to traditional practice, western medicine has ma de it possible to honor our bodies through the creation of medical screenings that are able to detect cancer before it has a chance to grow and spread throughout the body. AI/AN community members are typically diagnosed at later stages of disease compared to other races and ethnicities. Screening for cancer increases the success rate of treatment. Empowering communities to prioritize screening and early detection is an opportunity to address the impact on future generations. Lower screening rates among AI/ AN populations can be attributed to a variety of factors, including, though not limited to, access to care and structural barriers. Many AI/AN people receive primary care through UIHPs alone, making opportunities for a full spectrum of care oftentimes unav ailable. Many facilities do not have the capacity to perform screening and/or needed diagnostic follow -up, resulting in barriers for patients as they navigate screening and follow up care. While the IHS' Purchased and Referred Care is aimed at alleviating access to care, the completion of needed screening can be impacted by complications in the delivery service area, priority, and financial barriers. Potential Barriers/Challenges Lack of transportation Gaps in continuity of care (e.g. screening, follow u p, referral) Lack of data collection pertaining to patient family history Behavioral health factors negatively impact care (e.g. trauma, addiction) Lack of integrated care to address and document trauma (historical and current) Screening and Early Detec tion Goal: Increase screening rates within UIHP to detect cancers at earlier stages Breast Cancer Screening Objectives Strategies 20.

In addition to determining a treatment plan, the patient and their family must consider financial, legal, physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of how cancer can and will impact their life . Not only does treatment affect the p atient, it can also affect a patient's family, friends, and community as a whole. Throughout the treatment process, cancer care teams play a major role in assisting the patients through diagnosis, referral, and treatment. By empowering our relatives with resources and quality care, we believe that treatment will become more attainable, less stigma associated with screenings and treatment, and setting the bar for standard practice. Potential Barriers/Challenges Community support through medical processes Need for education on cancer and cancer treatment with attention to both cultural and health literacy Late stage diagnosis Time lag in getting patients referred into and starting treatment Cost of treatment IHS Purchased Referred Care funding to UIHP is severely underfunded Location and proximity to treatment centers Limited financial resources Patient navigation and interdepartmental coordination Treatment Goal: Ensure urban AI/AN cancer patients are receiving the highest quality of care in a timely manner .

Engage cancer treatment centers on the use of complementary and alternative healing practice during the treatment process 24 SURVIVORSHIP Despite advancements in cancer screenings, early diagnosis, and treatment, A I/ANs experience worse five-year cancer survival rates than any other subpopulation in the U nited States and have a 51% higher risk of dying from cancer compared to Non -Hispanic Whites (Jemal et al., 2017; Siegel, Miller and Jemal, 2020; White et al., 2014). Dedicated efforts to increase cancer surveillance and promote long -term follow up care and quality of life among AI/AN cancer survivors is critical to addressing these disparities . Cancer survivorship begins at diagnosis and endures throughout the lifespan of the individual (Hewitt et al., 2005). Family members, friends, caregivers and those who have been impa cted by a cancer diagnosis are also considered survivors (Twombly, 2004). Potential Barriers/Challenges Identifying survivors Racial misclassification in electronic health records and death certificates Lack of AI/AN specific cancer registry Consistency in coding cancer among providers Fractured health care system Social, mental, and spiritual support Survivorship Goal: Increase long -term quality of life for every urban AI/AN community member affected by cancer.

Increase the number of guideline -driven trainings and technical assistance on AI/AN survivor support 38C. Increase the number of integrated health systems and multidisciplinary teams developed to support AI/AN survivors 27 PALLIATIVE & END -OF-LIFE CARE Palliative care manages and provides relief from the complications of cancer and cancer treatment, such as pain and psychosocial effects, and is represented by the medicine wheel (sacred hoop) in many Indigenous cultures. Though palliative care is a major component of end-of-life care, it is distinct from end -of-life care in that it may be offered concurrently with curative treatment. End -of-life care, also known as hospice, is exclusive to the terminal phase of cancer and is offered when the survivor's health is progressively declining and curative treatment is no longer useful (World Health Organization). It i ncludes bereavement services which, i n many Indigenous cultures, include rituals and ceremony. Palliative care and hospice services improve quality -of-life and enhance the ability to cope effectively (Marr et al., 2012; Temel et al., 2010; World Health Or ganization). Moreover, early palliative care has been documented to prolong survival for a subset of patients with advanced cancer (Marr et al., 2012; Temel et al., 2010). Since urban AI/AN cancer survivors disproportionately present with late stages of ca ncer at the time of diagnosis, they may particularly benefit from more targeted and tailored efforts that promote their access to palliative and end -of-life care services (Guadagnolo et al., 2017). Potential Barriers/Challenges Lack of access to assistance with in -home care Fear Geographic location of treatment facilities Cultural practices are not always understood or accepted by providers Lack of knowledge on advanced care planning, will planning, etc. Palliative and End -of-Life Care Goal: Ensure access to patient and family -centered palliative and end -of-life care. Patient -Centered Palliative & End of Life Care Objectives Strategies 39. Increase the number of survivors reporting relief from cancer symptoms and side effects by 2022. Target Audience: UIHPs 39A.

Promote clinic policies to support culturally -tailored end -of-life care 29 PROMISING DIRECTIONS Our vision is a world where cancer is no longer the leading cause of death for Indigenous people. Through hard work, culturally appropriate community -based programs, and policy change that affords Native people access to the best prevention and treatment s trategies we hope to see a day where Native communities are free of the burdens of cancer. Reducing the burden of cancer in our urban AI/AN communities requires a multicomponent approach to address various cancer topics. This approach requires input from stakeholders who have different skill sets that add to the Urban AI/AN Cancer Coalition to reach the long term goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality of cancer among urban AI/ANs and there are many directions that we can take. AICAF recognizes the ne ed for resources on the following: Young survivors Youth involvement Environmental effects of carcinogens Promotion of STEM education among AI/AN individuals Incorporating Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) into health history Social determinants of health (SDOH) Determinants of Indigenous health (DOIH) We believe Native communities have the wisdom to find the solutions to cancer inequities, but are often se eking the organizational capacity, expert input, and resources to do so. We support innovative, community -based interventions that engage Native populations in the discovery of their own cancer best practices. We strive to be a partner trusted by urban community members, leaders, health care providers, and others working toward effective and sustainable cancer solutions. Join us in creating unique and culturally tailored solutions for our relatives to ensure quality care.

For the purpose of this Cancer Plan we will be using AI/AN. American Indian Cancer Foundation (AICAF) The American Indian Cancer Foundation (AICAF) is a 501(c)3 non -profit organization that was established to address the tremendous cancer inequities faced by American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The missio n is to eliminate the cancer burdens of Indigenous people through improved access to prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivor support. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0 -17 years). For example: experiencing violence, abuse or neglect; witnessing violence in the home or community; and having a family member attempt or die by suicide. Also included are aspects of the child's environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding such as growing up in a household with substance misuse, mental health problems, or instability due to parental separation or hou sehold members being in jail or prison. ( CDC, 2020). C Cancer Continuum The Cancer continuum has been used since at least the mid -1970s to describe the vari ous stages from cancer etiology, prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life ( National Cancer Institute , 2019) . Center for Disease Control and Preve ntion (CDC) The CDC is a federal agency that conducts and supports health promotion, prevention and preparedness activities in the United States, with the goal of improving overall public health. Established in 1946 and based in Atlanta, Georgia, the CDC i s managed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Commercial Tobacco Commercial Tobacco, shall mean any product containing, made, or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, whether chewed, smoked, absorbed, dissolved, inhale d, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means, or any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product, including, but not limited to, cigars; cheroots; stogies; periques; granulated, plug cut, crimp cut, other smoking tobacco; sn uff; snuff flour; cavendish; and other chewing tobacco; shorts; refuse scraps, clippings, cuttings and sweepings of tobacco, and other kinds and forms of tobacco; but does not include cigarettes as defined in this section. Tobacco products excludes any tobacco product that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product, as a tobacco dependence product, or for other medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold s olely for such an approved purpose. 32 D Determinants of Indigenous Health (DOIH) The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power an d resources at global, national, and local levels ( WHO, 2020). The determinants of Indigneous health (DOIH) recognizes the social determinants of health but further identifies th e experience of colonization and historical and ongoing trauma that AI/AN people face, which influences adverse health outcomes. Diagnosis The process of identifying a disease, conditions, or injury from its signs and symptoms. A health history, physical exam, and tests, such as blood tests, imagining tests, and biopsies, may be used to help make a diagnosis ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). E Early Detection Recognizing possible warning signs of cancer and taking prompt action leads to early diagnosis. Increased awareness of possible warning signs of cancer, among physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers as well as among the general p ublic, can have a great impact on the disease ( WHO, 2020). Electronic Cigarettes Electronic Cigarettes, shall mean any electronic oral device, such as one composed of a heating element, battery, and/or electronic circuit, which provides vapor of nicotine or any other substances, and the use or inhalation of which simulates smoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, marketed, or sold as an e -cigarette, e -cigar, e-pipe, or under and other product name or descriptor. Electronic Health Record An electronic (digital) collection of medical informatio n about a person that is stored on a computer. An electronic health record includes information about a patient's health history, such as diagnoses, medicines, tests, allergies, immunizations, and treatment plans. Electronic health records can be seen by a ll healthcare providers who are taking care of a patient and can be used by them to help make recommendations about the patient's care. Also called EHR and electronic medical records ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). G Gail Model The Gail Model is a statistical breast cancer risk assessment algorithm that was developed in 1989 by Dr. Mitchell Gail and colleagues with the Biostatistics Branch of the National Cancer Institute' s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. The Gail Model has provided to be a reasonable tool for estimating breast cancer risk in white women, and other researchers have subsequently supplemented the model to provide accurate risk assessments for Af rican- American, Hispanic, and Asian women. 33 H Hepatitis B Virus A virus that causes hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). It is carried and passed to others through the blood and other body fluids. Different ways the virus is spread include sharing needles with an infected person and being stuck accidentally by a needle contaminated with the virus. Infants born to infected mothers may also become infected with the virus. Although many patients who are infected with the hepatitis B virus may not have symp toms, long -term infection may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. Also called HBV ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Hepatitis C Virus A virus that ca uses hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). It is carried and passed to others through the blood and other body fluids. Different ways the virus is spread include sharing needles with an infected person and being stuck accidentally by a needle contaminated with the virus. Infants born to infected mothers may also become infected with the virus. Although many patients who are infected with the hepatitis C virus may not have symptoms, long -term infection may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. These patients may also have an increased risk for certain types of non -Hodgkin lymphoma. Also called HCV ( National Cancer Institute , 2020) . Human Papillomavirus (HP V) HPV is a group of more than 150 related viruses. Each HPV virus in the group is given a number which is called its HPV type. HPV is transmitted through intimate skin -to-skin contact commonly spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus. HPV infection can also cause cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, or oropharynx. N National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) The CDC established the NBCCEDP in 1991 to provide low -income, uninsured and underserved women access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services. As of 2018, the NBCCEDP funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, six U.S. te rritories, and 13 tribes and tribal organizations. National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) The CDC established the NCCCP in 1998 to support comprehensive cancer control by providing funding and technical advice to create, carry out and eval uate comprehensive cancer control plans, which focus on issues like prevention, detection, treatment, survivorship, and health disparities. As of 2018, the NCCCP funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, six U.S. associated Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico, and eight tribes and tribal organizations. National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH) NCUIH is a national 501(c)(3) organization devoted to the support and development of quality, accessible, and culturally -competent health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives living in urban settings. P Palliative Care 34 Care given to improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life -threatening disease. The goal of palliative care is to prevent or treat as early as possible the symptoms of a disease, side effects caused by treatment of a disease, and psychological, social, an d spiritual problems related to a disease or its treatment. Also called comfort care, supportive care, and symptom management ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Papanicolaou (Pap) Test A procedure in which a small brush or spatula is used to gently remove cells from the cervix so they can be checked under a microscope for cervical cancer or cell changes that may lead to cervical cancer. A Pap test may also help find other cond itions, such as infections or inflammation. It is sometimes done at the same time as a pelvic exam and may also be done at the same time as a test for certain types of HPV. Prevention In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition. For example, cancer prevention includes avoiding risk factors (such as smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and radiation exposure) and increasing protective factors (such as getting regular physical activity, staying at a healthy weight, and having a healthy diet) ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Purchased Referred Care (PRC) Medical/dental care provided at an Indian Health Service (IHS) or tribal health care f acility is called Direct Care. The Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program at IHS is for medical/dental care provided away from an IHS or tribal health care facility. PRC is not an entitlement program and an IHS medical referral does not imply the care will be paid. If IHS is requested to pay, then a patient must meet the American Indian/Alaska Native tribal affiliation, residency requirements, notification requirements, medical priority, and use of alternate resources (including IHS facility).( IHS, 2020) R Radon A radioactive gas that is released by uranium, a substance found in soil and rock. Breathing in too much radon can damage lung cells and may lead to lung cancer . S Screening Checking for disease when there are no symptoms. Since screening may find diseases at an early stage, there may be a better chance of curing the disease. Examples of cancer screening tests are the mammogram (for breast cancer), colonoscopy (for colorectal cancer), and the Pap test and HPV tests (for cervical cancer). Screening can also include doing a genetic test to check for a person's risk for developing an inherited disease ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Secondhand Smoke 35 The smoke that comes from the burning of a tobacco product and smoke that is exhaled by smokers. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking. Also called environmental tobacco sm oke and ETS ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Survivorship In cancer, survivorship focuses on the health and well -being of a person with cancer from the time of diagnosis un til the end of life. This includes the physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through treatment and beyond. The survivorship experience also includes issues related to follow -up care, late effects of treatment, cancer recurrence, second cancers, and quality of life. Family members, friends, and caregivers are also considered part of the survivorship experience ( National Cancer Institute , 2020) . Survivorship Care Plan A detailed plan given to a patient after treatment ends, which contains a summary of the patient's treatment, along with recommendations for follow -up care. In cancer, the plan is based on the type of cancer the treatment the patient received. A survivorship care plan may include schedules for physical exams and medical tests to see if cancer has come back or spread to other parts of the body ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). T Trauma -Informed Care Trauma -specific interventions are designed to address the consequences of trauma in the individual and to facilitate healing. Treatment programs generally recognize the foll owing: the survivor's need to be respected, informed, connected, and hopeful regarding their own recovery; the interrelation between trauma and symptoms of trauma; the need to work in a collaborative way with survivors, family and friends of the survivor, and other human services agencies in a manner that will empower survivors and consumers ( Source , 2020). Treatment Plan A det ailed plan with information about a patient's disease, the goal of treatment, the treatment options for the disease and possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment. A treatment plan may also include information about how much the treatment is likely to cost and about regular follow -up care after treatment ends ( National Cancer Institute , 2020). Treatment Summary A detailed summary of a patient's disease, the type of treatment the patient received, and any side effects or other problems caused by treatments. It usually includes results of laboratory tests and imaging tests, and whether a patient took part in a clin ical trial. A treatment summary may be used to help plan follow -up care after treatment for a disease, such as cancer (National Cancer Institute , 2020). 36 U United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) The United States Preventive Services Task Force is an independent, volunteer panel of national experts in disease prevention and evidence -based medicine. USPSTF works to improve the health of all Ameri cans by making evidence -based recommendations about clinical preventive services. Urban Cancer Solutions (UCS) Urban Cancer Solutions is an initiative of the American Indian Cancer Foundation funded by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP). Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI) UIHI is leading the way in research and data for urban American Indian and Alaska Na tive communities. As a public health authority and one of 12 Tribal Epidemiology Centers in the country - and the only one that serves Urban Indian Health Programs nationwide - UIHI conducts research and evaluation, collects and analyzes data, and provides disease surveillance to strengthen the health of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHPs) The urban Indian Health Program (UIHP) consists of 41 non -profit 501 (c)(3) programs nationwide. The programs are funded through grants and contracts from the IHS, under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. "}
