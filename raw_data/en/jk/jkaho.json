Although individually rare, collectively, 1 in 1 7 persons are affected by a rare disease in their lifetime [2]. Many patients with rare diseases are diagnosed late, particularly those with milder phenotypes presentin g at later a ges. As a consequence, these patients suffer lon g uncertainty, multiple hospital attendances, investigations, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate treatments,resulting in huge emotional cost and wasted time, effort and resources [1]. Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) are rare diseases of the immune system, with more than 400 forms described to date [3]. Predominantly (primary) antibody deficiencies (PADs ) are the most prevalent (but still rare ) PIDs; they are a typical example of such di fficult to recognise rare diseases. PADs lead to higher frequency o f infections in the upper and lower airways, often accompanied by severe chronic fati gue [ 3-6]. PADs can be divided into a gamma globulinaemias, defects of class switch recombination, and hypo gamma globulinaemias. Hypo gamma globulinaemia is by far the most common entity (generally > 50%), and in specialised centres, common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID ) is the most frequent form of hypogammaglobulinaemia seen (estimated prevalence in the population 1:10,000-50,000 )[7-9 ]. Many more patients live wit h less well described and understood forms o f hypogammaglobulinaemia: de ficiency o f IgG, IgG-subclass (es), IgM, IgA, and/or specific antibodies, alone, or in combination (s)[6]. We refer to these forms as unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD). These generall y considered 'milder' hypo gamma globulinaemia patients are o ften missed [10], because o f lack of awareness and incomplete investi gations. This thesis focuses on the early detection of hypo gamma globulinaemias, with a specific focus on unPADs. This introduction discusses the general principles of immunity with a focus on the adaptive immune system, followed by underlying genetic defects and clinical presentationof hypogammaglobulinaemia, with a special emphasis on unPADs, including the problem o f diagnostic delay, and explanation why we set up the unPAD study. Finally, the aims o f this thesis are outlined.12Cha pter 1 GENERAL PRIN CIPLE S OF IMM UNITY The immune system evolved as a defence against infectious diseases. An immune response consists of five parts: 1) reco gnition of forei gn and dan gerous material, 2) an early innate (non- specific) response triggered by this recognition, 3) a slower specific response to a particular anti gen (the adaptive response), 4) non-specific au gmentation of this response, and 5) memory of specific immune responses, providing a faster and larger response after repeated exposure to that particular antigen. The innate immune response is less e fficient, but fast, and involves physical and chemical barriers, circulating e ffector proteins, and cells with innate phagocytic activity: neutrophils and macrophages. The adaptive immune response is precise, but takes several days or weeks to develop, and consists of antigen-specific reactions through T- an d B lymp hocyte activities [11]. In contrast to the pattern recognition receptors o f the innate immune s ystem, which are of man y different t ypes but are not specific for a certain patho gen, the receptors of the adaptive immune system are all of the same molecular type and hi ghly patho gen-specific. Adaptive immune responses pp The adaptive immune system uses anti gen-speci fic receptors on T- and B lymphocytes to drive targeted e ffector responses in two stages [12 ]. First, t he antigen is presente d to an d recognised by antigen speci fic T or B lymphocytes, which leads to cell priming, activation, and differentiation. This usually occurs within the lymphoid tissues. Second, an e ffector response takes place, either due to activated T lymphocytes leavin g the lymphoid tissue and homin g to the disease site, or due to the production of antibody from activated B lymphocytes (plasmacells ) into blood and tissue fluids, and hence to the focus of infection (Figure 1. 1). Some o f these lymp hocytes persist in t he body an d provi de long-term immuno logical memory. In subsequent encounters wit h the same pat hogen, t he memory ce lls are quic kly activate d to yield a stron ger and faster adaptive immune response, which terminates infections with minima l illness. The development of B lymphocytes B lymphoc ytes develop from pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow and then migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues (i.e. lymph nodes, spleen, Peyer's patches; Figure 1.2 ). Durin g this process a unique B cell anti gen receptor (BCR) is created, which is made up of two identical heavy chains (IgH) and two identical li ght chains (Igk or I gl; each antibody contains either k or l light chains, not both). The immunoglobulin molecule consists of variable (V) and constant (C) regions. The V regions of heavy and light chains together form the antigen-binding site; the variability o f this site is responsible for the great diversity o f antigen-binding speci ficities among antibodies. The five main immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE ) result from differences in the heavy chain C region that result in differ ent physiological properties for each class. The 13General introduct ion 1V regions o f immuno globulin heavy and li ght chains consist o f families o f gene se gments: variable (V) and joinin g (J) gene se gments in li ght chains and an additional set of diversity (D) gene se gments in heavy chains [1 3]. Durin g the development of B lymphocytes, the arrays o f V, D, and J se gments are cut and spliced by DNA recombination. The additional deletion and random insertion of nucleotides at the ends of the V, (D) and J gene segments results in unique junctions, which, in combination with V, (D) and J gene segments contribute enormously to the BCR diversity between precursor-B lymphocytes. First, heavy chains (DH and JH) are rearranged in pro-B lymphocytes, followed by joining of a Vpy p yHVV segment to the rearranged DJH in the pre-B-I p lymphocyte stageyp y g [13]. Closest to the rearranged V-region gene is the m C-region gene, which is subsequently transcribed. Once a B lymphocyte expresses a m chain it is known as a pre-B-II p lymphocyteyp y , which represents two sta ges in B lymphocyte development: the less mature large g pre-B-II lymphocytes and the more mature small pre-B-II lymphocytes. While rearrangements py p y py p y of heavy chain genes occur in lar ge pre-B-II lymphocytes, rearran gements o f light chain genes occur in small pre-B-II lymphocytes. When success ful joinin g of light chain V and J se gments is achieved, and li ght chains are produced with m chains to form membrane-bound I gM, the I gM associates with the I ga and I gb molecules to form a B lymphocyte receptor complex. At this sta ge the small pre-B-II lymphocytes become immature B lymphocytes. Immature B lymphocytes that yp y are not specific for a self-anti gen mature further to express I gM and I gD and leave the bone marrow as transitional B lymphocytes yp y [14]. Mature B lymphocytes t hat have not yet encountere d their antigen are called na\u00efve sites na\u00efve mature B lymphocytes can encounter specific antigen. Antigen-specific B lymphocytes become activated by antigen-speci fic CD4 helper T lymphocytes. A fter this, some B lymphocytes migrate directly to the medullary cords o f the lymph node and di fferentiate into anti body-secretin g plasma cells. Other B lymphocytes migrate into a primary follicle to form p a germinal centre. Here, they become lar ge proliferatin g lymphoblasts (centro blasts ), which by inducin g somatic hypermutation in their immuno globulin genes, chan ge their a ffinity for anti gen. The centroblasts mature into more slowly dividin g B lymphocytes (centrocytes y ) and can under go immuno globulin class switch recombination [16,17] . Those B l ymphoc ytes that make surface immunoglobulins with the highest affinity for the antigen are selected by the process o f affinity maturation and mi grate from the germinal centre to other sites in the secondary lymphoid tissue or bone marrow, where they complete their differentiation into plasma cells secreting high- p affinity, isotype-switched antibodies [18]. As the primary immune response subsides, germinal centre B lymphocytes also develop into resting memory B lymphocytes possessing high-affinity, yy p y isotype-switched anti gen receptors. B lymphoc yte responses can also occur independentl y of T lymphoc yte help in the marginal zone o f the spleen or in the lamina propria in the gut [19,20]. These B l ymphoc ytes can be activated by the repetitive nature (i.e. polysaccharide lymphocyte in depen dent B lymphocyte is called the marginal zone B lymphocyte or natural B lymphocyte [22]. gy p y14Cha pter 1 1)B cell encounters antigen Processes an d expresses antigen in MHCII molecules B cellTh2 cell Plasma cellVH-DJH rearran gement Bone marrowNaive mature B y Development Bone marrowThymocyte s undergo pos itive activat e macropha ges 2) CD4 Th2 cells hel p antibody response s 3) CD8 c ytotoxic cell Figure 1.1.

Adapted Thesis Driessen 2013. 15General introduct ion 1PATH OPHY SIOLOGY The hallmark of hypogammaglobulinaemias is a defect in the production of normal amounts of antibodies with adequate anti gen specificity. They result from developmental defects in the B lymphocyte population. While defects in the early stages of B lymphocyte development(mostly defects in the pre-BCR molecule or pre-BCR si gnallin g pathway) can lead to the absence of immunoglobulins (agammaglobulinaemia), B lymphocyte defects in later phases of the developmental pathway can lead to various forms o f hyp ogammaglobulinaemia. The five classes or isotypes of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE) have different functions in the immune response. IgM is the first antibody produced in an immune responseagainst a pathogen. Surface IgM of the B lymphocyte receptor is monomeric, while secreted e ffector IgM consists o f a circular pentamer o f the Y-shaped immunoglobulin monomers. On initiation of an immune response, most of the antibodies that bind the anti gen will be of low affinity, and the multiple anti gen-bindin g sites of I gM are needed to enable the antibody to bind sufficiently stron g to a patho gen. I gD antibodies are produced in small amounts; their effector function is not known. The most important isotype in blood (IgG) is subdivided into four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 ), which are numbered to their relative a bundance in p lasma. IgG1 an d IgG3 su bclasses can direct ly recruit p hagocytic ce lls to ingest antigen-anti body comp lexes an d activate t he comp lement system. As IgG1 is t he most abundant IgG-subclass, IgG1 de ficiency o ften results in hypogammaglobulinaemia. O f the other I gG-subclass de ficiencies, at least I gG2 de ficiency is clinically relevant. Antibodies against encapsulated bacteria are mainly o f the I gG2 subclass, and there fore, the presence of IgG2 subclass deficiency should alert the clinician to test for concomitant specific anti- polysaccharide antibody deficiency (SPAD) in patients older than two years [2 3]. IgG4 is the smallest fraction; I gG4 deficiency considered clinically irrelevant [24]. Durin g pre gnancy, IgG antibodies are transferred across the placenta. F or this reason, unlike patients with T l ymphoc yte deficienc y, patients with antibod y deficienc y are usuall y free of infections until 7 to 9 months o f age, when maternal antibodies have declined to below protective levels. Ig A is the predominant immunoglobulin class in the body [25,26 ]. Most o f the IgA is produced and secreted by plasma cells in the gastrointestinal tract [2 7,28] . IgA is critical for mucosal immunity. Secreted I gA can be found in tears, milk, saliva, and sweat [29, 30]. IgE is specialised in the recruitment o f effector functions o f mast cells in e pithelium, activated eosino phils present at mucosal sur faces, and basophils in blood. When antigen binds the IgE, a strong reaction is triggere d that can expe l and kill parasites. Immuno globulins attach to patho gens (opsonisation) and facilitate their uptake by phagocytes. Therefore, immuno globulin deficiency leads to recurrent and/or severe infections. It is currently unknown how most forms of milder hypogammaglobulinaemiaarise. It seems likely that affected patients form a heterogenous group, where several genetic and environmental factors together determine the c linical phenotype, sev erity, and outcome.16Cha pter IN PRIMARY ANTIB ODY DEFI CIEN CY While the genetic basis of most patients with agammaglobulinaemia and class switch recombination (I gCSR) deficiencies has been identified, this is not the case for the majority of patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia. In patients with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA), the first genetic defect was identified in 199 3 in the gene for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is crucial for (pre)B lymphocyte receptor signalling and causes an early block in B lymphocyte development [31,32 ]. F ollowing the identi fication o f BTK mutations, other genetic defects in components o f the preBCR signalling complex were discovered, such as in the Ig heav y chain [33], l14.1 IgCSR deficiency, marked by disturbed co-stimulation of B and T lymphocytes in the germinal centre, the first geneticde fect was fied in the X-linked CD40L gene in 1993 [38 ], followed the CD40 gene in 2001 [39]. Later, other genetic defects affectin g CSR and somatic hypermutation were identified, such as in t he AID [40], UNG [41], and PMS2 [42] genes. B lymphocyte defects in later phases of the developmental pathway can lead to various forms of hypo gamma globulinaemia. Onl y for less than 20% of CVID patients in nonconsan guineous cohorts [9 ] and approximate ly 70 % of CVID patients in consanguineous cohorts [43], a certain or probable genetic defect has been esta blished, wit h higher preva lence in comp licate d CVID patients. T his percentage is even lower for patients with milder forms o f hypogammaglobulinaemia. This is explained by the highly complex o ften polygenic genetic basis o f hypogammaglobulinaemia and the lack of clarity o f many aspects o f the disease patho genesis [44] . The number o f identi fied causal genetic de fects is, however, likely to increase over the comin g years, because next- generation sequencin g is bein g performed in a growin g number of patients. Most genes identified in CVID patients so far are encodin g molecules with cellular functions as receptors or si gnallin g components in B l ymphoc yte development, differentiation, activation, and homeostasis [45,46 ]. The first identified gene defect in patients with CVID concerned the inducible costimulatory (ICOS ) gene in 2003 for TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor ) identified with CVID and IgA de ficienc y [48,49 ]. While biallelic TACI mutations are disease-causing, monoallelic mutations only result in increased disease susceptibility, but are not likely to be diseasecausin g because these mutations are also found in healthy individuals [50]. More recent data have revealed a major role for disturbances in the NF-kB pathwa y [51]. Important ly, the discovery o f these genetic aetiologies has revealed that some patients who were originall y classi fied as CVID patients, should actually be classi fied separately and rather be regarded as combined immunodeficienc y patients due to defects in interactions between T and B lymphocytes. This is for example the case in cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated anti gen (CTLA)4 deficiency and LPS-responsive (ESID) Registry, CVID is strictl y defined: a ge >4 years, markedly decreased serum I gG and I gA with or without I gM, poor antibody response to vaccines, and exclusion of secondary causes ( http:/ /www.esid.orgp/ / g ). By definition, these patients do not have relevant T lymphocyte deficiency (in laboratory investigations and/or clinically). If they do, they belong to another group (e.g., late-onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID ))[54]. However, even for CVID, ex pert o pinion varies as to which patients with decreased IgG and disturbed speci fic antibody responses should be classified under this diagnosis, some considering the combination with decreased IgA or decreased IgM sufficient and others diagnosing CVID only in case IgA is decreased (\u00b1 decreased IgM )[55]. Subgroups o f hypogammaglobulinaemia with isolated immunoglobulin deficiencies have been defined in the ESID Clinical Workin g Definitions for the ESID online Registry, such as specific antibody deficiency (SPAD ), IgA with I gG-subclass deficiency, isolated I gG-subclass deficiency, selective I gM deficiency, and selective I gA deficiency (see Table 1.1). All these definitions are solely based upon the results of immunolo gical laborator y investigations. It is not clear how useful they really are. Also, it is important to realise that these de finitions can only be used to classi fy a patient i f all relevant laboratory investigations included in the de finition have been per formed. Because this is o ften not the case, and because there is currently insu fficient evidence that these laboratory-based subgroups have clinical relevance, we prefer to combine all these patients under the umbrella de finition o f unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD ). Within this group, clinical severity as well as the results of immunolo gical laboratory investi gations differ greatly.18Cha pter 1 No. Subgrou p Criteria 1 Common variable immunodeficienc y disorders (CVID )Patients with at least one of the followin g: \u00b7 Increased susceptibilit y to infectio n \u00b7 Autoimmune manifestation s \u00b7 Granulomatous disease\u00b7 Unexplained polyclonal lymphoproliferation\u00b7 Affected family member with antibody deficiencyAND marked decrease of IgG and marked decrease of IgA with or without low IgM levels (measured at least twice; <2SD of the normal levels for their age) AND at least one of the following: \u00b7Poor antibody response to vaccines (and/or absent Isohemagglutinins) \u00b7Low switched memory B lymphocytes (<70% of age-related normal value ) AND secondary causes of hypo gamma globulinemia have been excluded AND dia gnosis is established after the 4th year o f life AND no evidence o f pro found T-lymphocyte de ficiency, de fined as 2 out of the following (y=year of life fic IgG (specific antibody deficiency - SPAD )Infections (recurrent or severe bacterial ) AND normal serum /plasma I gG, A and M and I gG-subclass level s AND pro found alteration o f the antibody responses to S. pneumonia (or other polysaccharide vaccine ) either after documented invasive infection or a fter test immunizatio n AND exclusion o f T-lymphocyte de fect 3 IgA wit h IgG- subclass de yInfections (recurrent or severe bacterial ) undetectable serum/plasma I gA level (with normal/lowish I gG and IgM levels ) AND low levels in one of more I gG-subclass (documented twice) AND norma l IgG anti body response to some vaccinations AND exclusion o f T-lymphocyte de fect 4 Isolated I gG- subclass deficienc yInfections (recurrent or severe bacterial ) AND normal I gG, A and M serum/plasma levels AND low levels in one or more I gG-subclass (documented twice) AND normal I gG antibody response to some vaccinations AND exclusion of T-l ymphoc yte defec t19General introduct ion 1Table 1.1.

As a consequence of these infections, especially in combination with dia gnostic delay [56], about one third of patients have alread y developed bronchiectasis at diagnosis [57]. are detectable in about half of these cases. Opportunistic infections do not belong to the clinical picture o f CVID, but o f LOCID [54,58 ]. Additional non-in fectious presentations occur in about one- fifth o f patients; they are diverse and include autoimmune diseases, granulomatous diseases, unexplained enteropathy and polyclonal lymphoproliferation [59]. Of ytic anaemia are disease, viti ligo, pernicious anaemia, psoriasis, hematosus (SLE ) [61,62]. Granulomas can be found in the lun gs, lymph nodes, skin, liver, gastrointestinal tract an d centra l nervous system [63]. Gastrointestina l com plaints are common in patients but o ften non-s pecific. A atrop hy is genera lly not gluten-sensitive an d is more likely to be due to a distinct autoimmune enteropat hy [64 ]. About 50% o f patients have splenomegaly, and about 10-25% lymphadenopathy as signs o f benign lymphoproli feration [3,65 ]. Simi lar to many PIDs, t he incidence o f cancer is higher in CVID, especially concerning lymphoid malignancies [66] an d gastric carcinomas [67 ]. Several classification systems have been published that allow the hetero geneous CVID cohort to be grouped into more homo geneous groups that share clinical and immunolo gical characteristics. The \"Freibur g\" classification, established in 2002, revealed si gnificant clusterin g of patients with splenome galy and autoimmune cytopenias in the group o f patients with severely reduced class-switched memory CD27+/IgM-/IgD- B lymphocytes (<0.4% of all lymphocytes (>20% ) 200 3, \"Paris\" classification was proposed, showin g a hi gher prevalence o f splenome galy, lymphoid proliferations and granulomatous disease in the patient group with almost no memor y B l ymphoc ytes [69 ]. Hereafter, several follow-up studies have confirmed that classification based on memor y B lymphoc yte subpopulations is useful for the identification of clinical subtypes of the disease [70-7 3]. In 2008, the EUROclass classification was published, which con firmed the association o f decreased memor y B lymphoc ytes with increased risk o f splenomegaly and granulomas and the expansion o f CD21low B lymphoc ytes with splenomegaly, but did not find a clear between CD2 1low B lymphoc ytes and autoimmunity transitional 21General introduct ion 1B lymphocyte expansion. Finally (so far ), also in 2008 a clinical classification proposed by Chapel et al. divides patients into five distinct clinical phenotypes comprisin g patients with no complications, autoimmunit y, pol yclonal l ymphoc ytic infiltration, enteropath y, gnancy, respectively [ 59]. Other hypogammaglobulinaemias yp g g Deficiency of IgG, IgG-subclass(es), IgM, IgA, and/or specific antibodies tend to appear incombinations. As single condition they can be asymptomatic, but a combination o ften leads to more symptoms and sequelae. Other hypo gamma globulinaemic patients also generall y present with recurrent \"normal\" ENT and airwa y infections caused b y common bacterial respiratory agents like pneumococci, Haemophilus in fluenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis [74].Many su ffer from chronic fatigue, leading to a decreased quality o f life, increased loss of participation in society (school, work ) and higher health care costs [75,76] . When IgA de ficiency is also present, gastrointestinal in fections with Giar dia lamblia occ ur more often. Furthermore, I gA de ficiency is associated with atopy and autoimmunity [2 3,77]. This association is also reported for I gM de ficiency, but studies on its clinical si gnificance are difficult to interpret because laboratory investi gations are o ften incomplete and studies have been a ffected by selection bias towards 'disease', as mostly symptomatic patients from tertiary centre co horts have been descri bed[78-81 ]. Anti-polysaccharide antibody de ficiency, o ften occurrin g with I gG2 deficiency, is associated with an increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria [82]. The recurrent infections may lead to irreversible damage to the middle ear, causing hearing loss [83]; the sinuses, causing local obstructive problems [84]; and the lungs, causing bronchiectasis with loss o f pulmonary function and a further increased tendency to develop lower respirator y tract infections [85]. Therefore, hypo gamma globulinaemic patients may be \"hidden\" amon g patients gnosed rare, patients wit h hypo gamma globulinaemia may a lso present wit h haemato logical malignancy or autoimmune manifestations. It is important to carefully monitor patients with hypo gamma globulinaemia as the disease may worsen over time and develop into overt CVID, especially when genetic risk factors such as mutations in TNFRSF1 3B/TACI are present [86]. with hypogammaglobulinaemia o ften go unrecognised, because most health care professionals, who are not specialised in immunodeficiency, do not consider potential PID in patients with common symptoms, such as recurrent \"normal\" infections and chronic fatigue. General practitioners (GPs ) see many patients who suffer from such problems, and, in most cases, no rare disease is present, and referral is not necessary. The concomitant fatigue is often interpreted to be of psychosocial origin or labelled as chronic fatigue syndrome. WhileunPADs are generally not immediately life threatening, a long diagnostic delay can ultimately lead to important morbidity, irreversible organ damage and loss o f lifespan when they are not recognised in time and adequately treated. Reducing diagnostic delay is there fore important. Important screenin g tests are lymp hocyte blood counts, serum immuno globulin levels (IgM, IgG, and IgA ) and evaluation of specific antibody responses to both currently accepted as the \" gold standard\" for the evaluation of anti - polysacc haride anti body pro duction capacity [87]. avai lable an d is time consumin g, labour intensive an d expensive [88]. The inter pretation o f the vaccine res ponse is di fficult, because uni form re ference values are not available and it must be interpreted in the context o f the patient's a ge and immunisation history [89-92]. There fore, su fficient experience is required to correctly interpret the results. It would be very interesting to search for widely available, reliable and easy-to-interpret screening tests that create a lower screening threshold for antibody de ficiency in patients with recurrent in fections in secondary care. Ultimately, this will help timely detection o f all patients who do have an immunodeficienc y.23General introduct ion 1THE UNPAD STUDY T o reduce the number of missed and unidentified unPADs in the future, the unPAD study was developed. This is a multicentre observational cohort study based on the ESID online Re gistry data. This study has the intention to describe in detail all types of PAD patients withou t a known specific mono genetic ori gin re gardin g their clinical and immunolo gical pattern at presentation and during follow-up, and to identify subgroups based on these clinical and immunological characteristics. Because PADs are rare, international collaboration is necessary to collect sufficient patient numbers for adequate research. A European immunology network (ESID) was formed in 1994, and since 2004 this network has been running an online database for PID patients. In this database, basic charact eristics can be registered at first registration and yearly therea fter in the so-called level 1 forms; more detailed characteristics can be registered in level 2 forms, which is mandatory for inclusion in the unPAD study [9 3]. All patients with 'unclassified antibody deficiency', 'deficiency of specific I gG (specific antibod gA this project to gether referred to as 'unPAD patients'] are eligible for analysis in the unPAD study. All data will be monitoredand - i f necessary - corrected be fore statistical exploration o f the registered data will be performed. Until now, level 1 and 2 forms o f 1010 patients have already been monitored, and there is a potentia l to expan d this to a bout 2000. T he unPAD initiative sti ll reac hes out to ot her centres and aims to become a platform that facilitates future collaborative research. Because plannin g a multicentre study is a lot o f work that requires substantial preparation time, and data collection is still on going, the results are not presented in this thesis .24Cha pter 1 AIM AND OUTLINE OF THI S THE SIS The overall aims of the studies described in this thesis are: 1. To improve earlier detection of hypo gamma globulinaemia 2.To increase knowledge of its clinical and immunological presentation patterns Speci fic aims o f this thesis are: 1. To assess the clinical impact of unPAD 2.To learn more about the clinical significance of truly selective IgM deficienc y 3. To better characterise presenting symptoms in children and adults with CVID 4. To explore reasons for PAD patients to seek medical care, and patterns in complaint presentation that led to the dia gnosis of PAD 5. To assess t he 23-va lent anti-PnPS IgG, IgM an d IgA screening tests' potentia l to ena ble a lower threshold for screening for antibody de ficienc y Inchapter 2 we descri be a secon dary centre co hort wit h PAD patients, in w hom t he majorit y had unPAD . In chapter 3 we review a ll previous ly pu blished patients wit h decrease d serum IgM and describe a cohort o f Dutch patients with persistent, isolated decreased serum IgM. In chapter 4 we describe a lar ger multicentre European cohort o f patients with I gM deficiency usin g data from the ESID online Re gistry. In chapter 5 we review a ll existin g data on the clinical presentation and follow-u p of CVID. In chapter 6 the desi gn and rationale for the unPAD stud y is presented. Chapter 7 explores the journey to a PAD diagnosis from the perspective of patients to anal yse how these patients appraised their s ymptoms and which factors were involved in a decision to seek medical care. In chapter 8 we descri be the application o f the 23-valent anti-PnPS IgG assay for predicting good responders to in a genera popu lation settin g. In chapter 9we describe the clinical relevance of 2 3-valent anti-PnPS I gM and I gA assays in addition to the anti-PnPS I gG assay. The implications of the studies are discussed in the General Discussion (cha pter 1 0) which also gives directions for future research .25General introduct ion 1LITERATURE 1.

PART I Describing hypogammaglobulinaemia PART I Describing hypogammaglobulinaemiaChapter 2 Mild Hypogammaglobulinemia can be a Serious Condition Lisanne Janssen d Knoops, MD, P hD, Mar kus S k\u00f6ld, PhD, Anton y Par ker, P hD, Jolanda de Vries , PhD,Esther de Vries 9:238436Cha pter 2 ABSTRA CT Background g Most patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) suffer from less-well described and understood forms of hypogammaglobulinemia (unclassifie dprimary antibody deficiency, unPAD). Because of the moderately decreased immuno globulin levels compared to CVID, unPAD is generally considered to be clinically mild and not very relevant. Objectivej T o describe our cohort o f - mainly - unPAD patients, and to analyse whether subgroups can be identified . Met hods Data were prospectively collected (F ebruary-2012 to June-2016 ) as part of a standardized, 1-day Care Pathway for suspected primary immunode ficiency. The TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL ) was part of the pre-first-visit intake procedure. Resu lts 320 patients were referred to the Care Pathway. Data from 2 3/27 children and 99 /113 adults who were dia gnosed with PAD and gave informed consent were available for analysis. 89/99 adults had unPAD, the majority (74%) were female and 44% already showed bronchiectasis.HRQoL was si gnificantly decreased in all domains, meanin g that a lot of unPAD patients had to cope simultaneously with pain, ne gative feelin gs and impairments in co gnition, home management tas ks, sleep, socia l interaction, an d wor k. The most prominent ly impaire d HRQoL domain was vitality, indicating these patients feel extremely tired and worn out. Conc lusion These results highlight the need for more attention to the potential patient burden o f unPADs. A larger cohort is needed to increase our understanding o f unPADs and to analyse whether distinct subgroups can be identi fied. F or now, it is important for the clinician to acknowledge the existence o f unPAD and be aware o f its potential consequences, in order to timely and appropriately mana ge its effects and complications.37Mild hypo gamma globulinemia can be a serious conditio n 2INTR ODUCTION Primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are rare, inherited defects of the immune system with more than 300 forms described to date [1]. Only a small sub group of patients suffer from a form of PID that leads to significant problems very early in life [2]. Most PID patients have PID forms that are less severe and present later in life [1-4], mainly comprisin g of diseases with predominantly (primary ) antibody deficiency (PAD ). PADs can be divided into agammaglobulinemias, de fects o f class switch recombination, and hypogammaglobulinemias. Hypogammaglobulinemia is by far the most common entity, comprising nearly hal f of all PID diagnoses [2,4 ]. In specialized centres, common vari able immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is the most common form of hypogammaglobulinemia seen (estimated prevalence in the population 1:10,000-50,000 )[5,6 ]. In the ESID Registry, CVID is strictly de fined: age >4 years, markedly decreased serum I gG and I gA with or without low I gM, poor antibody response to vaccines, and exclusion of an underlyin g cause (http:/ /www.esid.or g). Many more patients live with less well described and understood forms of hypo gamma globulinemia: deficienc y of IgG, IgG-subclass (es), IgM, I gA and/or specific antibodies, alone, or in combination (s) [4]. We refer to these forms as unclassi fiedprimary antibody deficiency (unPAD ). Because of the moderately decreased immunoglobulin levels, unPADs are generally considered to be clinica lly mi lder. However, data regar ding t he clinica l presentation, prognosis an d treatment o f unPAD patients are limited. These patients generally do not visit physicians in specialized /tertiary centres, and are often not treated with the immunodeficiency taken into consi deration . The s ymptoms o with hypo gamma globulinemia can lead to decreased qualit y of life, increased loss of participation in society (school, work) and hi gher health care costs [7-12 ]. These patients often go unreco gnized, because the general public as well as most health care professionals, who are not specialized in immunodeficienc y, do not consider potential PID in patients with recurrent 'normal' infections (responding to regular treatment, and not caused by an unexpected or opportunistic pathogen ). Their concomitant fatigue is often interpreted to be o f psychosocial origin or labelled as chronic fatigue syndrome. T o improve awareness and early detection of PID in patients with recurrent normal infections, we developed a Care Pathwa y for suspected primar y immunodeficienc y in the Jeroen Bosch hospital (JBZ ), a large teaching hospital (secondary centre ) in the southern part of the Netherlands. All patient data obtained in regular care in the Pathway were collected and stored electronically. In this report, we present a detailed analysis o f the available clinical data from the patients dia gnosed with PAD durin g the first four years of the Pathway who gave informed consent for usin g their data for this purpose; these were mostly unPAD patients. 38Cha pter 2 MATERIAL AND METH ODS Study design yg Data were prospectively collected, pseudonymized, and stored on a protected server using Research Manager software developed by Cloud9 Health Solutions (Deventer, the Netherlands ) as part of a standardized, 1-day Care Pathway for suspected PID. Data were collected on all patients referred to the Care Pathwa y from the start in F ebruar y 2012 to June 2016. The primary objective o f this study was to describe the patients, with special focus on unPAD patients, for this project including 'deficiency of specific IgG (specific antibod The secondary objective was to analyse whether subgroups could be identi fied. Only participants who gave written in formed consent were included in this stud y; the Medical Ethical Committee Brabant approved the study. The Care Pathway y Patients were re ferred to the Care Pathway when there was a suspicion o f potential immunode ficiency. Upon re ferral, data were collected electronically on patient and family history, and previous medical in formation was requested. Based on this in formation, the immunologist (author De Vries ) decided whether visiting the Care Pathway was indicated, based on the clinical presentations o f PID as presented in the ESID diagnostic protocol [3,13] . Patients could be referred by general practitioners or by medical specialists (e. g. pulmonolo gists, internists, ENT-surgeons, dermatologists). 77% lived the JBZ (320,000 people ), the remainin g patients were referred from other parts of the country. The Care Pathway comprised a visit to an immunolo gist specialized in the field of PID (author De Vries ), in addition to indicated laboratory and radiolo gic evaluations, and pulmonary function tests. After completion of the Care Pathway, each patient was evaluated in a mu ltidiscip linary team, atten ded by the immuno logist, a pu lmono logist, an internist, an d specialized nurse. The team formulated an advice for each individual patient on: 1) presence or absence of PID, 2) indication for treatment with immunoglobulin substitution and/or (chan ge of ) antimicrobial prophylaxis, 3) indication for investi gation of family members, and 4 ) necessity of referral to a tertiary centre. Assessments All assessments were per formed during regular, routine patient care and included online questionnaires to be completed by patients, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests and imaging. All patients recorded the following social, demographic and clinical characteristics: age, gender, smoking habit, previous symptoms, prescribed therapy, family history, and highest education level. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the age specific 39Mild hypo gamma globulinemia can be a serious conditio n 2TNO-AZL questionnaires: TNO-AZL Pre-school children's Quality o f Life questionnaire (TAPQOL, parents for children a ged 1- 5 years), TNO-AZL Children's Quality of Life questionnaire (TACQOL, parent s and child ren for children a ged 6-1 5 and 8-1 5 years, respectively), or TNO - AZL questionnaire for adult's HRQoL (TAAQOL, 16 years )[14]. Items in quire about the incidence of physical, psychological or social problems on different domains and are scoredon a 3- or 4-point Likert scale (TAPQOL & TACQOL 'ne ver / occasionally / often' a problem with ...; TAAQOL 'no / a little / some / a lot of ' difficulty in ... ). If a problem/difficulty is reported, parents and children 8-15 years rate how the children felt at those times on a 4-point Likert scale (TAPQOL 'well / not very well / unwell / very unwell'; TACQOL 'fine / not so good / quite bad / bad'); children 16 years and over and adult subjects rate how much that problem bothered them on a 4-point Likert scale (TAAQOL 'not at all / a little / quite a lot / very much' ). Higher scores indicate a better HRQoL. F or interpretation of the various laboratory tests, age-matched reference values were used. F or interpretation of pneumococcal antibod y responses laborator y specific reference values were use d1. Analysis of B- and T-cell subpopulations were performed as descri bed previous ly [15]. Hi gh-resolution CT (HRCT ) scans of the were scored by a t horacic ra diologist accor to t Fina lly, the immuno logist scored the diagnosis, first clinical presentation [3,13] and disease status of the patient . Statistical analysis y Continuous variables were summarized by mean and standard deviation (SD) when normally distributed, and otherwise by median and inter-quartile ran ge (IQR). Cate gorical variables were summarized by number and percentage. The group o f children with PAD was too small to per form statistical analyses . The domain scores of the TAPQOL, TACQOL and computed usin g yntax provi by the aut hors. T o ensure simi larit y wit h the Care Pat hway data, individuals outside the observed a ge ran ge of the Care Pathway patients (21-77 ) were excluded from the adult reference data before analysis, leavin g data from 4,120 subjects in the reference dataset. Analyses examining the associations between categorical variables in the adult patients were performed using Fisher's exact test. Analyses examining the differences in continuous measures in the adult patients were per formed usin g the unpaired t-test when normally distributed, and otherwise by the Mann-Whitney test. Because o f the great number of comparisons, only p-values <0.01 were re garded to be statistically si gnificant. The spearman's rank correlation coefficient test was used to examine the association betweenI gG subclass levels and pneumococcal vaccination response. The followin g cut-off values were used to describe r: 0.00 to 0.19 \"very weak\"; 0.20 to 0. 39 to \"moderate\"; 0.60 w hether the adult patient group cou ld be divided into su bgroups, K-means clusterin g was app lied creatin g between 2 to 5 clusters. Varia bles t hat ex hibited highly positively skewed distributions were analysed on the lo g scale. The Calinski/Harabasz pseudo-F index was calculated for each cluster solution; the solution with the lar gest value of this index indicated the most distinct clustering, and was chosen as the optimal solution.Next, the differences between clusters were examined, by comparing variables betweenthe clusters. The logistic regression model was used for evaluating the predictive e ffect o f famil y history, TAAQOL domains and HRCT findings for the patient diagnosis, classi fied as either CVID (according to the ESID Registry working diagnosis criteria) [16] or unPAD. F or factors where the dia gnosis was the same for all patients in a cate gory, it was not mathematicall y possible to perform logistic regression, and Fisher's exact test was used instead. Firstly, the association between each factor and the outcome was examined separatel y in a series o f univariable analyses. Subsequently, the joint associati on of the factors and the outcome was examined in a multivariable analysis. T o restri ct the number of variables in the second sta ge of the analysis, only those factors with a univariable p-value o f 0.10 were used for this sta ge. A backwards selection procedure was used to retain only the statistically signi ficant variables in the final model. This involves omitting non-signi ficant variables, one at a time, until only the signi ficant variables remain.41Mild hypo gamma globulinemia can be a serious conditio n 2RESULTS The Care Pathway y From the 320 patients that were referred to the Care Pathway between F ebruary 2012 and June 2016, 153 were shown to have some form of PID (92% PAD). In 99 adults and 23 children with PAD, written informed consent for inclusion in this analysis was obtained (details of patient selection process in Figure 2.1 ). Description of the paediatric patients pp p The group o f 23 children with PAD was too small to per form any meaning ful statistical analysis. An overview of their collected data is shown in Supplementar y T able 2. 1. The parents' main complaint at referral was that their child was 'ill too often' in 70%, for 8 3% the main reason for referral was to find out the reason why ('what is the matter with him/her' ). 15 children were re ferred by their paediatrician, 4 by their general practitioner, 3 by their ENT sur geon, and 1 by their dermatolo gist. A ge at referral was 2-16 yrs (mean 7. 5 yrs; median 6 yrs ); boys predominated (74% ). The clinical presentation [ 3,13] was 'recurrent ENT an d airway in fections' in 78%. 39% had an iron de ficiency and 39% had an increased total I gE, one third of these had 1 positive specific I gE in their serum (tree pollen, house dust mite, cat dander, dog dander and/or grass pollen ). In 22%, other family member (s) also had a PAD diagnosis (already known in three, not yet known in two cases ). A pulmonary HRCT scan was performed in five patients; two showed bronchopathy, none bronchiectasis. In 41%, a mild to moderate decrease in HRQoL was reported. Five were put on prophylactic co-trimoxazole, two on subcutaneous and two on intravenous immunoglobulin substitution . Description of the adult patients pp Of the 99 PAD patients ( 71 women, 72%), 89 had unPAD (66 women, 74%), and 10 had CVID (5 women, 50%) accordin g to the workin g dia gnoses used in the ESID online Re gistry [16]. An overview of their collected data is shown in Supp lementar y Table 2.2 . Age at referral was 21.0-77.4 yrs (mean 51.3 yrs; median 51.5 yrs). BMI, smokin g habits, and hi ghest educational level were com parable with the Dutch LISS panel, a re presentative sam ple o f the Dutch population (http:/ /www.lissdata.nl). The majority (n=4 3) was referred by their pulmonolo gist, followed by their general practitioner (n=35), and internist (n=1 5). The wide variety of clinical specialists the patients with PAD had visited prior to their re ferral to the Care Pathwa y is illustrate d in Figure 2.2 . The main complaint at re ferral was 'ill too o ften' in 87, with airway infections in 35, chronic cough in 4, and ENT-in fections in 9 patients. F or 35 patients being extreme ly tire d and having no energy was t heir most important comp laint. T he immuno logist characterized the initial presentation as 'recurrent ENT and airwa y infections' in 88, 'auto- immune or chronic in disease; lymphoproli feration' in 10, and 'unusual in fections or unusually severe course of infections' in 1 of the patients [13].42Cha pter 2 320 referrals to the Care Path 107 children (<18 yrs at referral ) 213adults (18 yrs at referral ) 5no show 20no 63no ID 51 no ID\u0003 iron y, both 5MBL allergy, 0iron ficienc y de ficienc y 1 secondar y ID 18secondar y ID 6 other PI D 1 cyclic neutro penia, 1 Netherton , 4 unclassified ID7other PI D 1 ring chromosome 18, 1 carti lage hair h ypoplasia, 1 deficienc , 2fsIgAdef,18unclassi fied ,3 no informed consent study inclusi on: 1 sIgMdef, 3 unclassified PAD sIgAdef, 93 PAD ,12CVID no informed consent for study inclusion: 1 2 unclassified PAD, 2 CVID\u00032 allergy, 0 iron deficienc y\u00030allergy, 2 iron deficienc y When taking all details of the ESID Registry Working Diagnoses into account, sIgA, sIgM and unclassified PADin these patients all fall under the Working Diagnosis 'unclassified antibody deficiency' (unPAD ).23 children and 99 adu lts wit h PAD included for anal ysis Figure 2.1.

Statistical analyses in the adult patients yp We assessed whether the concentrations of individual I gGsc correlated with the response to specific vaccine challen ges (Figure 2.5 ). Spearman's correlations between I gGsc and PVR were moderate for I gG2 (r 0. 52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 34-0.67, p<0.0001), and weak for I gG4 (r 0.27, 9 5% CI 0.06-0.47, p<0.0 5). There was a weak correlation between I gG1 and anti gen-specific antibody response a gainst tetanus toxoid (r 0.26, 9 5% CI 0.04-0.46, p<0.0 5). Detailed results of all I gG subclasses plotted on a lo garithmic scale with each PP serotype are shown in Supplementary Figures 2.3 and 2.4 .47Mild hypo gamma globulinemia can be a serious conditio n 2The combination o f PVR, I gA and I gG at first presentation to the Pathway could not predict bronchiectasis in the adult PAD patients. Pulmonary HRCT scan findin gs were also not associated with referrin g doctor type, gender, the complaint 'bein g always ill', CVID vs. unPAD diagnosis, or type of prescribed therapy. Mucus plu gging occurred si gnificantly more often in patients with 'recurrent ENT and airway infections' and/or chronic cough (41%), compared to patients who were always tired or had other complaints (15%) (Fisher exact test [98], p=0.04). 9 CVID and 89 unPAD patients completed the online TAAQOL questionnaire. Patients with unPAD scored significantly worse (P< 0.01) on all domains compared to the subjects in the reference dataset ( Figure 2.6 ). 3/9 CVID patients had already started immunoglobulin substitution when completing the TAAQOL questionnaire, there fore, it is impossible to draw conclusions from this group. In order to create separate sub groups of similar patients, associations between the ke y variables were examined. Cluster anal ysis showed that specifyin g two clusters resulted in the hi ghest F-statistic (24.8 ). The two clusters varied significantly for all but fine motor functionin g TAAQOL domain scores, but these clusters did not match the division between CVID and unPAD patients.

It is also the first study to examine HRQoL in unPAD patients. Our results demonstrate that unPAD can result in severe patient burden. Besides the hi gh proportion of patients sufferin g from bronchiectasis, their HRQoL was si gnificantl y impaired in all domains compared to the reference population. This stud y shows for the first time that many unPAD patients had to cope simultaneously with pain, negative feelings and impairments in cognition, home management tasks, sleep, social interaction, and work. A small number of previous studies have investigated HRQoL in PADs [ 7,9,19 ], some focusing solely on CVID [11,12,20,21 ], but patients wit h unPAD were not inc luded in t hese stu dies. T his unPAD group, generally considered to be a 'mild' form o f hypogammaglobulinemia, has hardl y received an y attention in the literature [22]. Based on our results, we stron gly recommend to c hange this. The most severely affected HRQoL domain was vitality, indicatin g unPAD patients feel extremely tired and worn out. This parallels the above-avera ge observed frequency of fati gue in PAD patients, not on ly compare d to t he genera l popu lation, but a lso compare d to t he tota l PID popu lation [23 ]. F atigue is an important an d debilitating pro blem, because it can lead to decreased daily activities, resulting in general deconditioning, which further a ffects fatigue and HRQoL in general. Clinicians should be aware o f this. While it was previously thou ght that bronchiectasis is the result o f repeated in fections due to de ficient antibody production [24], there is increasin g evidence t hat immune dysre gulation plays an important role in the disease process [2 5]. Based on these new insi ghts, the hi gh proportion of unPAD patients sufferin g from bronchiectasis at presentation in our cohort (44% ) - similar to the frequency reported in the literature for CVID patients [22,26-2 9] - is not t hat surprising. C learly, despite t he on ly mo derate ly decrease d immunog lobulin leve ls in unPAD compare d to CVID patients, unPAD can resu lt in compara ble serious pu lmonar y comp lications. Interestingly, there were nearly twice as many boys with unPAD in our paediatric cohort, but considerably more women than men in the adult group (74%). This may indicate thatthese diseases differ in different a ge groups. Perhaps unknown X-linked disease plays a role in some o f these bo ys with antibod y deficienc y [30,31 ]. The female predominance in the adult unPAD patients suggests the pathogenesis o f unPAD may di ffer between adult women and men. The tendency for immune dysregulation is widely acknowledged to be greater in women [32], but it is also possible that there are protective factors in men. It would be interestin g to confirm this pattern in a much lar ger cohort, and to further explore potential gender-specific mechanisms.50Cha pter pneumococca l vaccination responses (PVRs), or vice versa. Only a moderate correlation between I gG2-subclasses and PVRs was found. These results are in a greement with previous studies in patients with Hod gkin's lymphoma [ 33], in children with chronic chest infections [ 34], and in patients with I gA deficiency [35]. Thus, both are needed to fully explore the immune status of an individual patient . Our stud y has several limitations. First, the sample size was limited. Therefore, the insigni ficant results o f the exploration o f distinct subgroups in the unPAD cohort or di fferences between the unPAD and CVID patients, might be caused by the limited detection power. A future study in a much larger cohort may well be able to reveal separate clinical entities; the ESID online Re gistry would be a good tool for this. Second, the few CVID patients had partl y already started their immunoglobulin substitution therapy. This means our study should be mainly used as a thorou gh description of the - to date - lar gest cohort of unPAD patients, not as an important source for comparison of unPAD with CVID. Third, genetic testin g was not performed in most patients; it would be interestin g to investi gate this. It is possible that mildly a ffected patients with a known genetic de fect are 'hidden' in this cohort. Despite these limitations, our data s how, contrary to w hat is current ly assume d by most immuno logists in specialized /tertiary centres, that 'mild' hypogammaglobulinemia can be a serious condition. Also for those patients, early detection and adequate treatment is important .51Mild hypo gamma globulinemia can be a serious conditio n CES 1. Bousfiha AA, Jeddane Herz ME, gham-Rundles C, et al.

However, the reported hi gh prevalence of clinical problems in IgM-deficient patients may reflect the skewed tertiary centre population studied so far. Also, many papers on I gM-deficiency have included patients with more abnormalities than just IgM-deficiency. We studied truly selective primar yIgM deficienc yaccording to the diagnostic criteria of Society for Immunodeficiencies ESID ( true sIgMdef ) by reviewing the literature (261 patients with primary decreased serum-IgM in 46 papers) and retrospectively analysing all patients with decreased serum-IgM in a large teaching hospital in 's-Hertogenbosch, the serum-I gM, proven persistent in 4 5/359 (13%) cases; their medical charts were reviewed. Our main findin g is that true sIgMdef is probabl y very rare. Only 6/261 (2%) literature cases and 3/45 (7%) cases from our y fulfilled the ESID criteria; 6 3/261 (24% ) literature cases also had other immunolo gical abnormalities and fulfilled the criteria for unclassified antibody deficiencies (unPAD ) instead. The diagnosis was often uncertain ( possible sIgMdef(( ): data on IgG-subclasses and/or ff vaccination responses were lacking in 192/261 (74% ) literature cases and 42/ 45 (93% ) cases from our cohort. Our results also illustrate the clinical challenge o f determining the relevance of a serum sample with decreased I gM; a lar ger cohort o f true sI gMde f patients is needed to fully explore its clinical consequences. The ESID online Re gistry would be a good tool for this.85Selective I gM deficienc y 3INTR ODUCTION IgM deficiency is on the one hand reported to be associated with a wide range of clinical presentations includin g severe or recurrent infections, atopy, autoimmunity and mali gnancy [1]. On the other hand, there are doubts about its clinical significance [2 ]; studies in healthy populations have shown that genetic polymorphisms as well as environmental factors may influence serum IgM levels [2,3 ]. Previous studies on the clinical significance of IgM deficienc y have been a ffected by selection bias towards 'disease', as mostly symptomatic patients from tertiary centre cohorts have been described [4-6 ]. The European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) Registry defines primary selective IgM deficiency (sIgMdef ) as a serum IgM level repeatedly below 2 SDs of normal with normal levels o f serum IgA, IgG and IgG-subclasses, normal vaccination responses, absence o f T-cell defects and absence of causative external factors (http:/ /www.esid.org)p/ / g ) . Man y previousl y published articles that report on 'I gM deficiency' do not fulfil these criteria [7,8]. T o facilitate a clear discussion, we define three cate gories in our study: (1) truly selective primary I gM deficiency (true sI gMdef ) - the ESID criteria are completely fulfilled, y which means serum IgM leve ls are repeate dly decrease d and IgG, IgA, IgG-su bclasses an d vaccination responses have been determined and were normal for age; we consider the absence o f clinica l signs suggesting a T-cell defect sufficient; (2) possible selective primar y IgM deficiency (possible sIgMdef ) - the diagnosis of true sIgMdef is uncertai n, which means that the ESID criteria are not completely fulfilled, because data on I gG-subclasses and /or vaccination responses are lackin g; and (3) unclassi fied primary antibody deficiency (unPAD ) - other abnormalities in antibodies are also present: I gG-subclass deficiency, below-normal levels of I gG or I gA, and/or impaired vaccination responses . The aim of our study was to learn more about the clinical si gnificance of true sI gMdef. Therefore, we first conducted a scoping review to identify all previously published patients with decreased serum IgM. Second, we analysed decreased serum IgM identified through the laboratory files o f the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, a large teaching hospital (secondary centre). Finally, we analysed whether these fulfilled the criteria for true sIgMdef.86Chapter 3 MATERIAL S AND METH OD Literature search The PubMed database was searched for articles concernin g 'IgM deficiency' published until May 10, 2017 (no starting date). The search query was defined as {selective OR isolated} AND {I gM OR {deficiency OR low} AND {immunodeficiency syndromes}. We also screened the reference lists of articles identified by our search strategy and added those articles that reported about decreased serum IgM (snowball method). Our searchstrategy is described in detail in Supplementary Figure 3.1 . We considered decreased serum IgM to be secondary in combination with the use of immunosuppressive agents, malignancy (e.g. clear cell sarcoma, promyelocytic leukaemia, or coeliac disease ). Only papers that (also ) contained patients with primar y decreased serum IgM were included in the study. We analysed whether y these patients fulfilled the criteria for true sIgMdef. Our co hort Patient se lection All serum immuno globulin leve ls determine d between Ju ly 1, 200 5, an d Marc h 23, 2016, in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital (JBZ ) in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands (encachment area 350,000; 500,000 outpatient visits & 32,000 admissions per year ), were obtained (n=38,149; 5,342 (14% ) samples from children and 32,509 (85% ) samples from adults, missing age values in 298 samples). Of these, all samples with serum I gM values <0.4 g/l were selected (n=8,049, details in Supplementary Figure 3.2 ). Samples were excluded if serum IgM levels were normal accordin g to a ge-matched reference values (these were all youn g children ) [9]. T o identif y all patient s wit h isolated decrease d serum I gM, samp les wit h decrease d age- matched I gA- and/or I gG values as well as follow-up samples of serum-I gM were excluded. The me dical charts were screene d regarding patient history an d me dication use to exc lude the samples from those patients in whom decreased serum IgM could be secon dary (caused y by external factors; definition see literature review above). Patients with cystic fibrosis (n=3) were excluded because their clinical symptoms would be difficult to interpret. Laboratory data o f all primary cases were analysed to identi fy patients in whom serum I gM level was determine d only once an d in w hom serum I gM leve l was repeate dly determine d, but had normalized. Onl y the medical charts o f patients with pers isten t decreased serum IgM levels t were reviewe d in detai l; this patient group comprises both possi ble and true primary sIgMde f (definitions see Introduction ). The Medical Ethical Committee Brabant approved the study. 87Selective I gM deficienc y 3Data collection Data on demo graphics, clinical features, laboratory results and treatment, conclusions written by medical specialists and ICD-10-codes were derived from our electronic patient s ystem. F or clinical evaluation, we collected the type of medical specialist who discovered the decreased serum IgM, reason(s) for determining serum IgM, and clinical problems that could be related to antibody deficiency. We considered the following clinical problems to be possibly relatedto antibod y deficienc y: infections, atopic and /or autoimmune manifestations, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, long-lasting fatigue, depression and malignancies. Pneumonia required confirmation by thoracic X-ray. Allergic diseases (allergic rhino conjunctivitis, foodallergy, allergic urticaria, anaphylaxis) required testingor RAST . F or immunolo gical evaluation, we collected data on serum I gM, I gG and I gA levels and - if determined - data on IgG subclasses, T-cell subsets and function, antibody responses to vaccinations, gglutinin levels, antinuclear antibodies (ANA ) and specific serum IgE directed a gainst inhalant aller subpopulations a ge-matched reference used [10]. Because our laboratory cut-off for serum I gM levels is 0.2 g/l, a value of <0.2 g/l was replaced by 0.1 g/l for calculating mean serum IgM level (n=4 ). F or interpretation of pneumococcal antibody responses laboratory speci fic re ference values were used [11] . The follow-up period was defined as the date o f the first serum sample with decreased IgM until the date o f data extraction. A ll patient data were encrypte d and save d on a protecte d server using Researc h Mana ger software developed by Cloud9 Health Solutions (Deventer, the Netherlands). Statistica l ana lysis Statistical analysis was performed usin g SPSS for Windows, version 21. Descriptive statistics were used to compute frequencies of cate gorical variables and mean (with SD ) or median (with IQR ) of continuous variables dependin g on the distribution.88Chapter 3 RESULTS Literature search Supplementary T able 3.1 gives an overview of the identified relevant literature. 261 patients with primary decreased serum IgM were described in 46 papers. 8 patients (2 adults and 6 children ) fulfilled the criteria for combined immunodeficienc y, these were excluded. Only 6/261 patients (2.3%, 3 adults and 3 children) completely fulfilled theESID criteria fortrue sIgMdef; 63/261 (24.1%; 44 adults and 19 children) fulfilled the criteria for unclassi fied antibody deficiency. In 192/261 patients (73.6%, 164 adults and 28 children) the diagnosis was uncertain ( possibl e (( sIgMdef), due to incomplete laboratory data (Figure 3.1 ). 261 patients with primary decreased serum IgM reported in the literature 6 patients wit h true sIgMdef192 patients wit h possible sIgMdef63 patients with unPA D 3 adults 3 children 164 adults 28 children44 adults 19 children No data on PAR and I gG-subclasses: 126 adults, 12 childre n Data on I gG-subclasses present, no data on PAR: 27 adults, 0 children Data on PAR present, no data on I gG-subclasses: 11 adults, 16 children Figure 3.1.

Clinical and laboratory features o f the published adult and paediatric cases with true or possible sI gMde f are summarized in T ables 3.1 and 3. 2. Over two-thirds o f both adults and children were male ( 57/8 5 adults, 67% vs. 2 3/31 children, 74%). Many patients presented with infectious problems (30/62 adults, 48% vs. 14/1 5 children, 9 3%). In 3/62 (5%) of the reported adults decreased I gM was identi fied \"by accident\" as part o f laboratory evaluation for ischemic heart disease, hypertension and visual disturbance. 1 3/62 (21% ) of the reported adults and 1/15 (7%) child were asymptomatic; this boy was detectedduring family screening. Serum IgM values were reported in 86 adults and 14 children (mean 0.23 g/l, range 0.004-0.45 g/l for adults vs. Undetectable I gM levels were reported in two children [12,13] and four adults [14]. Three a dults an d one baby were treate d wit h intravenous immuno globulin substitution (IVIG ). Our cross-sectional retrospective cohort p 2,064 patients with isolated decreased serum IgM were identi fied in the laborator y system of the JBZ (July 1, 2005, to March 23, 2016): 2,034 adults and 17 children aged 6-18 years (13 children <6 years were excluded because the age-matched reference value was lower than the cut-off value of the test ). The patient selection process is shown in detail in Supplementary Figure 3.2 . 1,68 5/2,0 34 adults (8 3%) and 7/17 had secondary isolated decreased serum IgM. 349/2,034 (17%) adults and 10/17 (59%) children had a primary form; of these, serum IgM levels were determined more than once in only 49/349 (14% ) adults (14% ) of the adults the serum IgM level normalized, yielding persisten t isolated decreased serum IgM (t possi ble (( or true sIgMdef cases ) in 42 adults and 3 children. More than half of the adults (54.8% ) and all the children were male. Mean a ge at the date of the first serum sample with decreased I gM was 61 (range 33-86) years in the adults and 16 (range 16-17 ) years in the children. Mean follow-up time was 74.8 (range 20-1 33) months in the adults and 102.7 (range 82-119 ) months in the children. Clinical and laborator y features are described in Tables 3.2 (3 children) and 3.3 (42 adults). The onset and duration of symptoms could not be determined accurately in themedical files. 24% o f the adults and two o f the three children were anal ysed for suspected potential immunode ficiency. The others were detected during analysis for other problems, however, 22% of these adults and the one child had a histor y of s ymptoms that could be related to antibody deficiency (mainly infections ). The majority (72% ) of adults without such symptoms remained asymptomatic durin g follow-up; 28% developed symptoms that could be related to antibody deficiency. In none of the patients a family history of immunodeficiency was found in the medical charts. Only 7% (2 adults and 1 child ) completely fulfilled the ESID criteria for true sIgMde f. The first serum I gM level in possibl eor tru esIgMdef cases ran ged from <0.2 to 0. 39 g/l (mean 0. 30 \u00b1 0.84) in the adults and from 0.28 to 0. 38 g/l (mean 0. 34 \u00b1 0.0 5) in the children. First serum I gA levels were increased (>4.0 g/l) in 7 adults (17%). Serum I gE levels were determined in 6 adults and 1 child (mean 1 33 \u00b1 182 U/ml; ran ge 5-410 U/ml ); they were elevated (>90 U/ml ) in 2 adults.

Our main findin g is that true sIgMdef is probably very rare. Unfortunately, when a decreased serum IgM level is found, it is rarely fully analysed. In most cases in our cohort serum I gM levels were determined only once (86%). When proven persistently decreased, further immunological analysis is often not performed (data on IgG-subclasses and/or vaccination responses were lacking in 74% o f the literature cases and 93% of the cases in our cohort). Also, different criteria for 'selective IgM deficienc y' are used in the literature; in a quarter of the cases, the deficienc y is not 'selective', other immuno logica l abnorma lities were present. Eig ht literature cases even s howe d clinica l and /or laboratory signs fitting combined immunodeficiency; these should not be classified as a form of 'predominantly antibody deficiency'. Sixty-three (24% ) classification 'unclassified antibod y deficienc y'. These patients with concomitant defects in specific antibody production (SPAD ) and/or I gG-subclass deficiencies may be at risk of more severe and frequent infections, comparable to the increased number of lower respiratory tractinfections and bronchiectasis in patients with IgA deficiency in combination with IgG-subclassdeficiency and /or SPAD [15 ]. Patients with recurrent and /or severe infections and decreased serum IgM levels in combination with SPAD, have been described to bene fit from immunoglobulin treatment [4,16]. Routine determination o f serum I gM is advised in many medical protocols, mainly for adults; we showed in our cohort that this leads to many incidental findin gs of decreased serum I gM. The relatively common findin g of a low serum I gM level in - immunolo gically speakin g - asymptomatic adults (see T able 3.3), often not followed by further evaluation, warrants re-evaluation of these medical protocols. In our cohort, secondary decreased serum I gM was 5 times more prevalent in adults and 2.5 times more prevalent in children than the primary form. Hobbs et al. reported that secondary decreased IgM was 20 times more prevalent than the primary form in 1975 [17]. T his may be explained by the fact that age-related re ference values have changed over the years, as the sensitivity of the methods used to measure serum IgM increased (Hobbs et al. years and g/l 16 years). Anyway, the first reaction to findin g a low I gM should be to exclude a secondary cause . The fact that only a few incidental findings o f decreased serum IgM were followed by further evaluation in our cohort, suggests that the perceived medical problems were mild. Most o f our incidentally diagnosed cases with true or possible sIgMde f did not have a history o f symptoms related to antibody deficiency (76%), and that often remained to be the case durin g follow-up (72% ) (on the other hand, 28% later developed symptoms that could be related to antibody deficiency). The higher prevalence of various associated diseases in the literature cases [1] is probably related to the fact that these patients had been referred to specialized allergy and immunology clinics [4-6 ].101Selective I gM deficienc y 3Interestin gly, possible or true sI gMde f was more frequently observed in males in our cohort. T his parallels the observe d ma le predominance in t he literature. However, a lso amon g healthy controls low I gM levels are more common in males [18-21 ], and there are some reports of low serum I gM levels amon g fathers of patients [22,2 3]. It would be of interest to investigate this gender difference further. The limitation of our study is of course its retrospective design. We collected our cohort data from the medical files, which were not collected with a research purpose in mind. There fore, we could not correct for environmental factors and genetic polymorphisms that may in fluence serum IgM levels [3]. However, although very interesting on a population basis, these factors are probably not very help ful in directing decisions regarding individual patient care in the doctor's consultin g room. In conclusion, our review of the literature and retrospective secondar y centre cohort study on decreased serum I gM, illustrate the challen ge of determinin g the clinical si gnificance of a serum sample with decreased I gM. The dia gnosis could rarely be made with certainty, buttruly se lective primar y IgM deficiency is probably very rare. Our strict definitions and thorou gh analysis o f the available in formation have yielded the lar gest cohort study so far. Still a larger cohort o f true sIgMde f patients is needed to fully explore the clinical consequences; the ESID online Registry would be a good tool for this.102Chapter 3 REFEREN CES 1.

Therefore, it is difficult to determine the clinical policy followin g such a finding. Only few reported IgM-deficient patients fulfil the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) dia gnostic criteria for selective I gM deficiency (true sI gMdef), or their diagnosis is uncertain due to insufficient laboratory data (possible sIgMdef ). Decreased serum IgM is o ften incidentally found in asymptomatic adults. The objective o four stud ywas to further characterize true sIgMde f and to compare the European data collected through the ESID Registry community (tertiary centres) to our previously published Dutch cohort (secondary centre ). Fifteen centres (12 countries ) participated with 98 patients. Patients were excluded if serum IgM was only determined once (n=14 ), had normalized (n=8 ), or if they also had other immunolo gical abnormalities (n=1 5). T en patients ( 5 adults) completely fulfilled the ESID criteria for true sI gMdef. A ge-matched cut-off values varied widely between centres; when usin g the ESID dia gnostic protocol reference values, only 6 patients (5 adults ) had true sI gMdef. Because of these small numbers, further analyses were performed in patients with true or possible sIgMdef (13 adults, 48 children ). Respiratory infections were commonly reported at presentation (adults 54%, children 60% ). Symptomatic adults had lower serum IgM levels (mean 0.27g/l, 95%CI 0.22-0.31 0.30-0.36; p=0.02 ). T o be able to explore the clinical consequences o f true sIgMde f, we should fully analyse and accurately describe those patients in whom a decreased serum IgM is found.121The SIMcal stud y 4INTR consequences of isolated decreased serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M levels are not sufficiently known. Clinicians stru ggle with what they should do with such a findin g. IgM deficiency has mainly been studied in tertiary centre cohorts, where a variety of clinicalmanifestations have been linked with decreased serum I gM levels, includin g severe or recurrent infections, atopy, autoimmunity and malignancy [1]. Only small cohorts of IgM deficient patients have been described so far [2,3,12,13,4-11]. In 2006, the largest study to date was published, reporting data from 36 patients [14]. The reported patients are almost alwa ys symptomatic and most of them presented with infections [1] . We recentl y showed in a secondary centre population that decreased serum IgM levels can often incidentally be foundin asymptomatic a dults [15 ]. The determination o f the clinical signi ficance o f sIgMde f is not only challen ged by the rarity and hi ghly variable phenotype of this primary immunodeficiency, but also by the different criteria for 'selective I gM deficiency' that are used in the literature [4,13,14,16]. ESID has defined primary selective immuno globulin (Ig)M deficiency (sIgMdef ) as a decreased serum I gM level (repeatedly 2 SD below the mean for a ge) with normal levels of serum IgA, IgG and IgG subclasses, normal vaccination responses, absence of Tcell defects, and absence of causative external factors (http:/ /www.esid.org)p/ / g ) . When t hese criteria are completely fulfilled, we re fer to this condition as 'truly selective primary IgM deficiency' (true sIgMdef ), albeit we consider the absence of clinica l signs suggesting a T cell defect a sufficient criterion. Only six of 261 (2%) patients described in the literature with 'I gM de ficiency' completely fulfil the de fined criteria for true sI gMde f [15]. F or many reporte d patients the dia gnosis is either uncertain, which means that the ESID criteria are not fulfilled completely because data on I gG subclasses and/or vaccination responses are lackin g (we refer to the latter as ' possibl e sIgMdef ' )[15], or their I gM deficiency is not selective, because other antibod y abnormalities are present; these cases fit the ESID classification 'unclassified primary antibody deficiency' (unPA D) [3,4,17]. A larger cohort o f true sIgMde f patients is needed to further explore the clinical consequences. There fore, we initiated this multi-centre observational cohort study using the ESID online Database. We also compared these European data (tertiary centres) to our previously published Dutch cohort (secondary centre) [1 5]. 122Cha pter 4 MATERIAL S AND METH OD Patient Identification and Recruitment Email messa ges with the proposal to participate in the SIMcal study were sent out to all members of ESID to identify as many patients known to ESID members as possible with sIgMdef. Fifteen centres a greed to participate. Of these, 11 centres had re gistered their patients in the ESID online Database [18]. The four centres not connected to the ESID online Database also joined the SIMcal study. All patients documented by the participating centresto have sIgMde f were eligible for analysis. Only the patients with possible and true primary sIgMdef were analysed in detail (for definitions, see introduction). In all cases, patients had given informed consent for analysis of their data. The Medical Ethical Committee Brabant approve d the SIMca l stu dy. Data Co llection The development, on going mana gement and technical database structure of the ESID online Data base were descri bed previous ly [18]. All participatin g centres entere d their data in t he study questionnaire, providin g available demo graphic and clinical data (gender, date of birth, country o f residence, a ge at dia gnosis, date o f diagnosis, presentin g history, conditions durin g follow-up, pathogens, familial cases, consanguinity ), as well as laboratory test results (serum IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE levels, IgG-subclasses, T cell subsets and function, antibody responses to vaccinations, Isohemagglutinin levels, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA ) and specific IgE directed a gainst inhalant aller gens), treatment (antibiotics, immuno globulin substitution), and follow-up period (date of the first serum sample with decreased IgM until the date of dataextraction ). The answers to the questionnaires were encrypted and saved on a protected server usin g Research Mana ger software developed by Cloud9 Health Solutions (Deventer, the Netherlands ). F or interpretation of serum immuno globulin levels, centre-specific a ge- matched reference values were used. Almost all centres used immunonephelometric or immunoturbidimetric techniques (14 out of 15 ); in one centre radial immunodiffusion was used (Egypt). The method of data collection for the 42 adults with true or possible sIgMdef from the secondary centre has been described before [15]. Statistical Analysis y Frequenc y data were ana lysed wit h chi square ana lysis, an d the Fis her exact test w hen expecte d cell values were lower t han 5. Measurement data were expresse d as means wit h standard deviations (SD) and confidence intervals (CI). Differences in measurements were tested with T-test (Welch's T-test when the variances are unequal ) and ANOVA. The statistical software package used was IBM SPSS statistics version 24. 123The SIMcal stud y 4RESULTS Data from 98 patients were reported from 15 centres in 12 different countries. Thirty-seven patients ( 37%) were excluded: 14 because serum I gM level was only determined once, 8 because serum IgM level had normalized, and 15 because other immunological abnormalities were also present (these patients fulfilled the criteria for unPAD ). Of the remaining 61 patients, only 10 fulfilled the ESID criteria for true sIgMdef (5 adults, 5 children), and 51 had possible sIgMdef (8 adults, 43 children) when using the age-matched cut-o ff values for serum IgM used by the reporting centre. In those with possible sIgMde f, the following immunological laboratory investigations were not determined: pneumococcal vaccination responses (0 adults and 20 children ), IgG subclasses (1 adult, 0 children ), or both (7 adults and 23 children ). Cut-off values varied widely between centres (Figure 4.1 ). When ESID dia gnostic protocol cut-off values for serum I gM were used [19], only 6 patients ( 5 adults, 1 child ) had true sI gMdef, and 8 had possible sI gMdef (6 adults and 2 children ).

Most children were reported from Turkey (n=24 ), by Italy (n=11 ), Tunisia (n=4), (n= 3), Iran (n= 3), The Netherlands (n=1), and Spain (n=2). The mean a ge at the date of the first serum sample with decreased serum IgM in this possible/true sIgMdef cohortwas 7 years (range 0-17 years). Mean follow-up time was 54 months (range 0-162 months). Boys predominated (79%), but there was a significant association between country and gender (Fisher exact test, 2-sided, p=0.002). The numbers of children in the various countries were too small to draw reliable conclusions from the gender data ( Figure 4. 2). Consanguinity was present in six patients (13%, n=2 male), absent in 39 (81%, n=35 male), and not reportedin three (6%, n=1 male). These patients from consan guineous families were reported by Iran (2 out of 3), Italy (2 out of 11), and Turkey (2 out of 24). F amilial cases were present in three patients (6%; 2 from Iran, 1 from Italy ), absent in 42 (81% ), and not reported in three (6%). Figure 4.2.

Other infectious manifestations included mycobacterial adenitis, skin infections, and bilateral pneumonia with an abscess. Atopic manifestations occurred in 11 children (21% ), including eczema, food allergy, and asthma. An autoimmune manifestation occurred in 1 child125The SIMcal stud y 4(2%), more specific information was not available in the database. The first serum I gM level ranged from 0.12 to 0.62 g/l (mean 0. 35 g/l). In the majority of the children, I gM levels were not decreased accordin g to the ESID dia gnostic protocol values; none had undetectable levels of serum I gM (Figure 4.3 A). Analysis of variance showed a si gnificant effect for differences in serum IgM levels between countries (F = 5.858, p=0.001, partial h2 = 0.417, Figure 4. 3B). Especially in Belgium serum IgM values were higher and in Tunisia and Iran lower, but due to the low number o f patients reported by these countries, it is di fficult to interpret these results. Mean serum I gM levels were hi gher in males than in females (mean 0. 37 versus 0.26 g/l; t(12.208) = 2.697, p=0.02), but when the variation between countries was taken into account, this difference was no longer significant (two-way ANOVA; F(1,37) = 2.038, p=0.1). Serum IgE levels were determined in 25 children (mean 184 U/ml, range 3-1225 ); they were elevated (>90 U/ml ) in 11 children (44% ). Specific IgE (s) to 1 inhalant allergen 8/16 children (50% ). Isohemagglutinin (anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the IgM class ) were determined in 2 3 children, and low in two. Lymphocyte subsets were performed in 30 children (Table 4.1 A). Three children (6%) were treated with intravenous . Clinical manifestations of the children with true sIgMdef are described separately in Table 4.1B(see Supp lementar y Table 4.1 for more details on all the children, and Supp lementar y Table 4. 2 for a comparison between the Turkish children (largest group ) and the children from the other countries ). Adults Thirteen adults (7 males) with true or possible sI gMdef were reported from Turkey (n=4), Czech Republic (n=4), The Netherlands (n= 3), and the United Kin gdom (n=2). The mean a ge at the date of the first serum sample with decreased I gM was 40 years (ran ge 21-6 3 years). Mean follow-up time was 64 months (range 4-144 months ). None of the adults had a family history of immunodeficiency (unknown in one ) or consan guinity. Clinical manifestations of the adults with true sIgMdef are described in Table 4.2 A (for A details on all the adults, see Supplementary T able 4.1 ). Increased susceptibility to infections, especially involvin g the respiratory tract, occurred most often (n=7). Other reported infectious manifestations included hepatitis B, menin gococcal sepsis, and recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) g atopic dermatitis and aller gic rhinitis. Autoimmune manifestations occurred in three (Sjogren's disease, alopecia, celiac disease). The first serum I gM level ran ged from 0.10 to 0.62 g/l (mean 0.27 g/l). Serum I gE levels were determined in five adults (mean 109 U/ml, ran ge 4-410 ); they were elevated (> 90 U / ml) in two. Isohema gglutinin titres were determined in four adults, and low in one. Lymphocyte subsets were performed in 9 patients (Table 4.2 B), all fell within the normal range. None of the adults were treated with IVIG, three (23%) with prophylactic antibiotics .126Cha pter 4 Figure 4. 3.First serum I gM levels in the children from the tertiary centre cohort. Figure 4.3.

Comparison between the tertiary and secondary centre cohorts of adult patients py y p We first compared the 1 3 adults with true or possible sI gMdef from this tertiary centre cohort with the 42 adults with true or possible sIgMde f from the secondary centre cohort we previous ly pu blished [15]. These two cohorts di ffer in the type o f population from which the data were collected (general hospital versus specialized medical centres ) and in the way of collecting the data (analysing all laboratory data with decreased serum IgM versus onl y analysin g patients reported as dia gnosed with I gM deficiency by an immunolo gist). Given this different patient selection process, further immunolo gical analyses were as expected more often performed in the tertiary centre cohort: repeated measurements of serum IgM in 86% vs 14% (Fisher exact test, p<0.001), measurements of I gG subclasses in 92% vs 14% (Fisher exact test, and pneumococcal vaccination responses in 42% vs 7% (Fisher exact test, p=0.00 3). Not only in the previously described secondary centre cohort, but also in this tertiar y centre cohort but few patients can be classified as true sIgMdef (Figure 4.4 ). In contrast to the tertiar y centre cohort, adults in the secondar y centre cohort were often asymptomatic.

The mean a ge at diagnosis was si gnificantly hi gher in patients without symptoms that could be related to antibody deficiency (mean 65 years, 95%CI 60-70 ) compared to those with symptoms from the secondary centre (mean 56 years, 95%CI 49-64 ) and tertiary centres (mean 40 years, 95%CI 31-49; p<0.01). We evaluated the mean first serum I gM levels in the different clinical manifestations (Figure 4.5B ). Two symptoms, autoimmunity and fati gue, showed a si gnificant difference, the patients with the symptoms havin g lower I gM levels (autoimmunity n = 6, mean 0.21 g/l, 9 g/l, 9 5%CI 0.16-0.29; no 5, p=0.0 3). When combinin g all symptoms that could be related to antibody deficiency, adults with these symptoms (n= 31) had si gnificantly lower I gM levels compared to adults without these symptoms (n=24) (mean 0.27 g/l, 95%CI 0.22-0.31 pter 4 Figure 4. 5.

T o date, it is not clear what the clinical consequences of such afinding are, and whether and if so how such patients should be treated. The results of our study underline these challen ges. Not only in our previously published secondary centre cohort [15], but also in this tertiar y centre cohort as well as in other cohorts in the literature [4,5,13,14,16 ] only few patients with decreased serum IgM levels have true sIgMde f. This condition is probably very rare. However, the adults with more severely decreased serum IgM levels were more likel y to be younger and to be symptomatic. This information can help in interpreting the clinical signi ficance when an isolated decreased serum IgM level is discovered. While just below normal values tend to have little clinical meanin g, we su ggest that lower cut-off values than the current 'two standard deviations (SD) below the mean' probably distin guish the clinicall y relevant cate gory of patients. We propose to develop a classification for sI gMdef similar to the one previously developed for selective I gA deficiency. This classification distin guishes selective IgA deficiency (serum IgA <0.07g/l ) from the often clinically irrelevant partial IgA deficiency (serum IgA >0.07g/l but 2 SD below normal age-adjusted means ) [20,21] . For selective IgM de ficiency, such a cut-o ff value will have to be determined in future studies. Our stu dy has severa l limitations. First, our resu lts are based on a sti ll relative ly sma ll cohort includin g not only true but also possible sI gMde f. This group contained a hi gh number o f children, which is in contrast to few children re ported in the literature [13]. This is probably bias resultin g from the type of centres that decided to participate in the study. Second, it is possible that mildly affected patients with a known genetic defect are 'hidden' in the sI gMdef population and fulfil the criteria for syndromic immunodeficiencies instead [22-25]. This can only be revealed by genetic testing in such cases. Third, age-matched cut-o ff values varie d widely between t he centres; w hen using t he ESID diagnostic protoco l values, even fewer patients had true sIgMdef (1 child, 5 adults ). This cannot only be explained by variations in technique or in genetic, ethnic or geographical di fferences, which have also been shown to influence serum IgM levels [26-32]. Almost all centres (14 out of 15) used immunone phelometric or immunoturbidimetric techni ques, which have been demonstrated to be re liable an d to have goo d compara bility [33,34 ]. Althoug h inter- laboratory varia bility in the current methodologies can make uni fication o f reference values challenging, investigating opportunities for achieving this would be worthwhile. In conclusion, even this multi-centre study could not solve the dilemma. Even enlar ging the study to global proportions will probably not answer our questions. T o be able to explore the clinical conse quences o f true sIgMdef, full analysis and accurate description of all patients in whom a decreased serum IgM is found would be more effective, leaving no patients with possible sIgMdef to dilute the results.135The SIMcal stud y 4REFEREN CES 1.

There is no generally accepted symptom-recognition framework for its early detection. Objectivej To systematically review all existing data on the clinical presentation of CVID. Methods PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane were searched for cohort studies, published Januar y/1999- December/2019, detailing the clinical manifestations before, at and after the CVID-diagnosis . Resu lts In 51 studies (n=8521 patients ) 134 presenting and 270 total clinical manifestations were identified. Recurrent upper and /or lower respiratory infections were present at diagnosis in 75%. Many patients had suffered severe idiopathic thrombocytopenia (6%) were also frequently reported. A bimodal sex distribution was found, with male predominance in children (62% ) and female predominance in adults (58%). 25% of CVID-patients developed other manifestations besides infections in childhood, this percenta ge was much hi gher in adults (62% ). Immune-dysre gulation features, such as granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease and inflammatory bowel disease, were more prominent in a dults. Conc lusions The shi ft from male predominance in childhood to female predominance in adults suggests differences in genetic and environmental aetiology in CVID and has consequences for pathophysiologic studies. We con firm the high frequency o f respiratory in fections at presentation, but also show a hi gh incidence o f severe bacterial in fections such as sepsis and menin gitis, and immune dysre gulation features includin g lymphoproliferative, gastrointestinal and autoimmune manifestations. Early detection of CVID may be improved by screenin g for antibody de ficiency in patients with these mani festations.149CVID clinical presentation s 5INTR ODUCTION Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) is a collection of heterogeneous clinical manifestations linked by low serum levels of immuno globulins and primary failure of specific antibody production [1-3]. The rates of serious comorbidities and resulting mortalit y of patients with CVID drastically exceed the respective rates in the general population, imposing a high disease burden to the individual patient [4,5]. Although CVID is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency (PID), it is still a rare disease with a greatl y varying observed prevalence between countries, ranging in \"industrialized countries\" from 6.9/100,000 in Finland to 0.6 /100,000 in Spain [6-14] and even lower observed prevalence rates (<0.5/100,000 ) in \"developing\" countries [15]. Therefore, CVID has a low prevalence in primary care an d genera l hospita l settings, w here non-immuno logists have little know ledge of this disease. Also, respirator y infections and non-infectious complications of CVID such as lymphoproliferation, granulomatous disease and autoimmunity are much more prevalent without concomitant CVID. This makes it challenging to front-line clinicians to recognize t CVID in these cases. Because of the variability of presentin g clinical manifestations, patients visit various physicians of different specialties in search of a diagnosis, which increases the risk o f missing the overarching clinical pattern and thereby overlooking the underlying hypogammaglobulinemia [16]. Time ly diagnosis an d optima l management are likely to resu lt in improve d clinica l and quality-of-life outcomes for patients with CVID, hi gher participation in society (school, work) and lower health care costs [4,17-19]. Reducin g diagnostic delay is therefore crucial; current approaches mainly comprise improvin g education and awareness of clinicians in both primary and secondary care. Already a lon g time a go, the Jeffrey Modell F oundation (JMF) developed ten (mainly paediatric ) 'Warnings Signs' to indicate PIDs [21]. Unfortunately, these signs have turned out to have a low sensitivity for timely PID diagnosis [22,23]. In order to improve our insight in the early presentation o f CVID and to assist physicians in its timely detection, we aimed to systematically identi fy and collate existing published cohort studies on the presenting clinical manifestations at and before diagnosis. In addition, we included the overall clinical manifestations durin g disease follow-up in our systematic review; this was done separately for children and adults to evaluate age-related di fferences and simi larities in paediatric an d adult onset CVID.150Chapter 5 MATERIAL S AND METH OD Search strategy gy We searched EMBASE, Cochrane and PubMed from January 1999 to December 2019 (inclusive) using a combination of subject headings and free text incorporating the terms 'common variable immunodeficiency', 'late onset hypo gamma globulinemia', and 'dia gnosis', and limited to English language and humans. Reference lists of included studies were alsosearched for potentially relevant studies (snowball method). The complete search strategy is detailed in the Supplementary appendix eSearch . The protocol o f this systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42019121384. Study selection y We considered all primary research studies for selection, either retrospective or prospective, o f any study design (e.g., case series, cohort ), describing the clinical manifestations for a minimum of 10 patients with CVID. Two researchers (LJ and EdV ) independently screened titles and abstracts of all papers, excludin g clearly irrelevant studies. Hereafter, they independentl y reviewed the full text o f remainin g papers to assess eli gibility. I f multiple updates o f a cohort were pu blished, the most recent stu dy wit h the largest dataset descri bing the tota l clinica l picture o f their CVID cohort was included, in order to avoid duplicates o f patients in our review. The large European multicentre study by Gathmann et al. [24] was excluded for analysis to avoid overlapping data, because this study collated data from multiple centres that already published a substantial amount o f their data as sin gle-centre cohorts in more detail. Three European multicentre studies [25-27] partially overlapped in their included centres; in this case the lar gest multicentre study by Chapel et al. describin g the overall clinical picture of CVID was included [26] (for details about the handlin g of overlappin g data, see Supp lementar y Table 5.1). Studies that selected cases based on the presence of only certain clinical features of CVID (e.g., only granulomatous, pulmonary, gastrointestinal or autoimmune manifestations ) were excluded to avoid giving disproportionate weight to those features in the data synthesis, unless the total number of CVID patients from which these cases were selected was also reported. When the same centre/registry published an article about their total cohort and another article in which children and/or adults were separately described, these children- and adult-specificoverlappin g data were only included in the sub group analysis for children vs adults. Any uncertainties regar ding stu dy se lection were discusse d between LJ, Mv dF , an d EdV. Quality assessmentQy After assembling a shortlist o f studies eligible for potential inclusion, LJ assessed the risk o f bias in these studies to ensure that onl y those studies with an acceptable risk o f bias were included. This qua lity assessment was c hecked by EdV. Because t here is no va lidated qua lity checklist for assessing retrospective cohort studi es, we constructed a checklist based on 151CVID clinical presentation data: meta-analysi s 5relevant items from (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiolo gy) reportin g guideline for observational studies [28], the STROBE (stren gthenin g the reportin g of observational studies in epidemiolo gy) reportin g guideline for cohort studies [29] and CASP (critical appraisal skills pro gram) guidelines for case-control and cohort studies (checklist in Supplementary T able 5.2 ) [30]. Quality was assessed as 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable' in three domains: definition of CVID, selection of cases, and methods for extracting data on included cases. 'Acceptable' for case definition re quired cases to be defined according to the diagnostic criteria of ESID/Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency (PAGID) [3], the ESID Registry working definitions for clinical diagnosis of PID (www.esid.org), the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) criteria [31], the World Health Organization (WHO) scientific group [ 32] or the international consensus document (ICON) [ 33] (Supplementar y T able 5.3 ), or - if no reference was made to which diagnostic criteria were used - description of the inclusion criteria correspondin g to the above described dia gnostic criteria. Althou gh we on ly inc luded artic les a bout pae diatric CVID t hat reporte d to have on ly inc luded established CVID patients, we cannot completely rule out that a few of these patients actually had transient hypo gamma globulinemia o f infancy. 'Acceptable' for case selection required that at least two o f the participants' baseline characteristics were clearly documented and that the characteristics o f cases were su fficiently consistent with the current knowledge regarding CVID (i.e., the age and sex distribution of cases matched the known epidemiology of CVID ). 'Acceptable' for data extraction required the use of a standardized data collection format and/or the objective measurement of si gns (e. g., CT confirmation of bronchiectasis, biopsy confirmation of granulomas). Disa greements between the two reviewers (LJ and EdV) were discussed with a third reviewer (MvdF ) until a greement was achieved. Only studies considered b y the two reviewers to be acceptable for case definition and to pass in at least one ot her domain were inc luded, an d data re lated to t he 'unaccepta ble' domain were not included in t his review . Data extraction Data were extracted from included studies by LJ using a standardized Microso ft Excel spread sheet and were checked by EdV and MvdF . We extracted study characteristics includin g year o f publication, country, recruitment periods, number and type o f centres, study desi gn, number of patients, a ge and sex. Clinical manifestations were recorded, and numbers of patients with each manifestation were noted. This was done separately for the clinical manifestations at presentation (at or before dia gnosis) and overall (at any timepoint). When this distinction was not described, the manifestations were collected as 'overall' in the standardized format. When a clinical mani festation was not discussed in a stud y, we made no assumption about whether or not that mani festation had occurred in that population but recorded this item as 'missing data' for the respective study in the standardized format. Wedeliberately chose to use the exact wordings o f the included studies, to avoid interpretation152Chapter 5 bias. Clinical mani festations were never counted twice. F or example, where one stud y separate ly descri bed sinusitis an d otitis, anot her stu dy only mentione d 'upper respirator y tract infections'. In addition , we recorded whether in a cohort children , adults or both were described. A paediatric cohort was defined as a ge durin g follow-up <18 years old, which was comparable to the cut-off value for children's age provided by the original studies. We did not contact the authors of included papers to collect additional information. Statistical analysis y We used MetaXL (version 5.3, EpiGear International, Queensland, Australia) to calculate proportions and standard errors (SEs ) of proportions for each clinical manifestation in each included study [34]. T o combine the results of multiple cohorts, we calculated pooled proportions o f each clinical mani festation using the metan command. Anticipating high heterogeneity between included studies, we per formed random e ffects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian an d Lair d met hod and stan dard met hods to ca lculate I2 as an estimate of hetero geneity. In a ddition, we con ducte d two su bgroup ana lyses usin g the same tec hniques: 1) children vs adults, and 2 ) clinical manifestations at presentation vs overall clinical mani festations during the disease course. A subgroup analysis based on age was conducted because the few available studies on di fferences between paediatric-onset and adult-onset CVID have yielded limited and conflicting data [35-37]. In order to improve our understandingo f the early presentation o f CVID, which can assist clinicians in timely detection o f this condition, we focused our analysis on clinical mani festations at or prior to dia gnosis.153CVID clinical presentation data: meta-analysi s 5RESULTS Search result s After removal of duplicates, we identified 1604 papers. We excluded 14 53 after screenin g titles and abstracts, and a further 96 after full-text assessment (Figure 5. 1), based on the inclusion criteria (see Method). Reference lists of included studies yielded 21 additional eli gible studies. There was full consensus between the authors regarding study inclusion.

Characte ristics of included stud ies The 51 included studies described clinical mani festations in a total o f 8521 ) [5,6,41- 50,19, 51-60,26,61-70, 35,71-80, 36,81, 37-40]. 50 studies were conducted in one or more centres in one countr y onl y, in 18 di fferent countries in total; 1 stud y included multiple centres from different countries [26]. Most were cohort studies (5 prospective, 42 retrospective ) and three compared cases with controls. All 51 studies 154Chapter 5 extracted data from written/typed hospital records. The majority of studies (n=39) identi fied cases from hospital records alone; others also used re gional, national, or continental re gistries of primary immunodeficiencies (n=12). Three studies also obtained data from a patient and/or parent-completed questionnaire [ 56,75,77]. Fifteen studies reported clinical manifestations of their total CVID cohort, but reported in more detail on patients based on the presence of onl y certain clinical features of CVID: asthma and allergic diseases [46,80], autoimmune manifestations [47,52,54], gastric cancer [71], gastrointestinal manifestations [56,59], granulomatous manifestations [41,48], or pulmonary manifestations [45,62,63,75,76 ]. Risk of bias of included studies Most included studies defined cases using the diagnostic criteria of PAGID and ESID (27 studies ); other used criteria were: the ESID Registry working diagnosis criteria (8 studies ), International consensus document (3 studies ), IUIS criteria (2 studies ), and WHO classification (4 studies ). Seven studies did not report which criteria were used but did describe a CVID diagnosis that corresponded to the above approved classi fications. One study reported to use both the dia gnostic criteria of PAGID/ESID and the WHO classification [49]. Lack o f routine B an d T ce ll immunop henotypin g in most stu dies pro hibited an accurate assessment of potential late-onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID ). 37 studies (73%) included all consecutive cases within the study period, with a further 11 studies (22%) describin g why a proportion of potentially eligible cases were excluded. In the remaining 3 studies (6%), the proportion o f consecutivel y included cases was unclear. A weakness o f the included studies was lack o f clarity at which point in the diagnostic and follow-up pathwa y clinical features were recorded. Twent y studies explicitl y stated when clinical manifestations occurred (at or before dia gnosis (n=4 ), and both follow-up (n=16 )). The remainin g 31 studies were unclear as to when the reported clinical manifestations occurred durin g the disease course. Pooled frequencies of clinical c haracteristics from meta-analysis qy Pooled frequencies o f demographic in formation are shown in Table 5. 2. In paediatric CVID patients, males were in the majority (62%, 9 5% CI 54-69), while females predominated in the adult CVID patients (58%, 9 5% CI 53-64). The hi gh pooled proportion of consan guinit y in the paediatric and total cohort should be interpreted with caution ( 31% and 20% respectively; only one study reported this for adults ). This proportion varied substantiall y per country. In an Ar gentinian cohort none had a history of consan guinity [ 37], while the rate of consan guinity was very hi gh in an Iranian cohort (72% ) [64]. In total, 147 out of a potential of 270 meta-analyses were conducted. F or the remaining 123 clinical mani festations, meta-analysis was not possible since the features were each reported in only one study. The high heterogeneity ( I2) statistics in the de gree of hetero geneity between studies was greater than that expected b y chance alone and con firmed the appropriateness o f random - effects meta-analysis to generate pooled proportions. There were 49 specific clinical manifestations for which it was possible to calculate pooled proportions for the subgroup at presentatio n, i.e. 'at or before diagnosis'; these are shown in Figure 5.2 in com parison with overall, i.e. 'at, before or after' diagnosis. The most frequent clinical manifestations at presentation (reported in 39% of patients) are shown above the grey dotted horizontal lines. A history of upper and/or lower respiratory infections was present at diagnosis in three-quarters of patients (upper respiratory tract in fections in 73%, lower respiratory tract in fections in 57% y present in almost one third of the patients at or before the CVID diagnosis was made (28%, 9 5% CI 18-40 ). Non-infectious manifestations (14%, 0-7 ) correspond to the estimated lifetime prevalence estimates in the general population of 30% [82], 12% [83], and 0.9% (type 1 ) An overview of all reported clinical mani festations at and be fore dia gnosis with - when known - li fetime prevalence estimates from the general population is included in Supplementary T able 5.4. In Figure 5.3, all clinical manifestations that were present in 10% of patients are shown (as presented, whether or not likely related to CVID ); the CVID-associated manifestations are also s hown w hen present in <10 % when t hey were consi dered important to incorporate by the authors (based on obvious relation with CVID in the current literature or consensus in the field ). We grouped these manifestations into eleven distinct clinical categories according to the body system affected and the clinical phenotypes described by Chapel et al. [26]. Anoverview o f all reported clinical mani festations is included in Supplementary T able 5. 5. Many CVID patients developed in 29%, and autoimmune manifestations in 27%. In addition, a substantial number of patientsdeveloped mali gnancies (10%) and atopic diseases durin (asthma (25%), aller gic rhinitis (18% )).156Chapter 5 T able 5.1.

Our findin gs can help clinicians to reco gnize CVID, and to estimate how common a clinical manifestation is in paediatric and adult CVID. Weidentified 1 34 different presentin g clinical manifestations in patients diagnosed with CVID g (the limited number of data impeded splitting up between children and adults). In addition, we identi fied 270 di fferent clinical mani festations occurring during the entire course o f the disease (147 in children and 170 in adults). Most frequent presenting manifestations were recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (73%), lower respiratory tract first two ESID and first three JMF warning signs for PID [20,21]. However, these manifestations are also frequent in the general population and may lack discriminatin g value, unless their unusually recurrent and persistent nature is reco gnized [8 5]. Other alerts to potential PID that are in line wit h the JMF warnin g signs t hat may be more discriminatory inc lude severe bacterial infections (osteomyelitis ), which are clearly more frequent than lifetime prevalence in the general population. Recent studies already demonstrated a high incidence o f antibody de ficiency in patients with pneumococcal meningitis [86-88], confirming our finding of a high frequency of infectious meningitis in CVID, but we also show a high incidence o f bloodstream in fections, mastoiditis and to a somew hat lesser extent osteomye litis in CVID patients. T his su ggests t hat the incidence o f CVID may also be increased in patients with bloodstream in fections, mastoiditis and osteomyelitis without other clear predispositions and su ggest screenin g for CVID could be useful in these patients. This findin g warrants further exploration. One of the most reliable alerts to potential CVID was CVID in the family (12% of the total reviewed population ). Both the six ESID and ten JMF warning signs make no mention of other presenting manifestations than frequent and /or severe infections, such cytopenia (10%) and (6%)). Our results suggest that also lymphoproliferative, gastrointestinal and autoimmune manifestations should be included in warning signs for predicting PID. This is important, because we still fail to detect the disease early enough. Increasing awareness o f this varied and complex presentation o f CVID can lead to earlier detection and initiation o f treatment. Our findin gs show a male predominance in children with CVID (62%), but a female predominance in adults (58%). This is also observed in atopic disease and we previousl y described this in patients with unclassified primar y antibod y deficienc y [89], but it has not previously been recognized in CVID. This sex shift may indicate that aetiology differs in different age groups. Early childhood male predominance suggests X-linked heredity is167CVID clinical presentation data: meta-analysi s 5present in some boys dia gnosed with the disease; adult female predominance su ggests sex hormone effects, environmental exposure, and epi genetic influences may play a role [90]. This im plicates that future studies that attem pt to define mechanisms that under pin CVID should be stratified accordin g to sex. There were clear differences in clinical manifestations occurring during the disease course between children and adults with CVID. Overall prevalence of bronchiectasis was 36% in adults vs 16% in children. Persistence of an 'infection-only' phenotype was much more prevalent in paediatric than in adult CVID (76 vs 38%). During childhood, three quarters o f patients developed no other complications besides in fections, while this percentage was much lower during follow up in adults (38%). Immune-dysregulation features, such as granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lun g disease (1 5 vs 6%), chronic diarrhoea ( 34 vs 17%), and inflammatory bowel disease (18 vs 3%) were more prominent in adults compared to children. A possible explanation could be lon ger on going inflammation and lon ger follow - up in the adults [62]. One is an adult for many more years than one is a child, thus there aremany more physician visits in the adult years and more opportunities for CVID complicationsto be observed. The di fferent si gns and symptoms observed in CVID between paediatric and adult age, with more non-in fectious disease complications in adults, suggest that di fferent monitoring strategies for children and adults during follow-up may be warranted. Most common (27%). While only a quarter of CVID patients had features o f immune dysre gulation at presentation, this increased to about half of the patients throu ghout the course of the disease. This su ggests that these manifestations more often occur later in the disease course. It is crucial that CVID patients are monitored for the develo pment of these complications, because some of these are difficult to treat and associated with increasedmortality (4,14 ). The coincidence of immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation can be explained by several mechanisms. Immunodeficiency may result in insufficient clearance of microbial antigens, and the resulting persistent antigenic exposure could then trigger granulomatous disease and autoimmunity [91]. Both complications have been linked to hyperplastic germinal centres enriched with polyclonal/self-reactive B-cell clones [92], and immature B cell development [25] in CVID. In addition, low numbers of regulatory T-cells [91,9 3], and an increasin g number of genetic defects [94] have been associated with immune dysre gulation in CVID. Additional factors, such as commensal microbial epigenetic modifications remain to be better elucidated [95]. Interestin gly, we found hi gh pooled prevalence's o f atopic diseases both at presentation of CVID and durin g the entire disease course (asthma 31 vs 2 5%, aller gic rhinitis 36 vs 18%). The pooled prevalence's of asthma and allergic rhinitis are higher in CVID compared to the estimated lifetime prevalence's in the general population of 13.6% [96] and 6.6% [97], respectively. This should be interpreted with caution because of the considerable168Chapter 5 hetero geneity between the studies (I2 >80 ). Also, not all patients underwent cutaneous or in vitro testin g or spirometry to support these dia gnoses, nor was it reported how o ften the asthma was atopic in nature. It is possible that s ymptoms derived from the deficient immune system were interpreted as atopic disease, on the other hand, atopic disorders could actually be more prevalent in CVID. Overlap between the symptoms of atopic diseases and immunodeficiency may lead to delayed diagnosis, so it is important to consider CVID in patients with atopic diagnoses who are insufficiently responsive to standard treatment and who also have in fections. T o further elucidate the association between atopic diseases and CVID, a prospective multi-centre study in a large unselected CVID cohort would be needed. A substantial number o f patients developed malignancies during the disease course (10%, 9 5% CI 7-14). This pooled prevalence is comparable with the result of a previous focused meta-analysis of malignancy prevalence in CVID (8.6%, 95% CI 7.1-10) [98]. Also, in alignment with previous reports the most common mali gnancies were lymphoid mali gnancies (5%, 95% CI 1-4 ) [71,72,98-100]. The lack of data on controls impedes com parison of our results to the normative population, but the prevalence's are higher compared to the li fetime prevalence estimates in the United States population (lymphoid malignancies 2.3%, gastric cancers 0.8% ) lung-, colorecta uterine-, liver-, an d pancreatic cancer an d leukaemia were simi lar to w hat one might expect in the general population according to the li fetime risk statistics based on the United States population (Supp lementary T a ble 5. 4) [101]. Strengths and limitations g This analysis collates data from >8000 patients (850 children, 2998 adults, 4673 not specified/both) in 51 studies from 18 different countries. The included studies were conducted in Euro pe, North- and South America, and Asia; there were no studies from Australia or Africa. Our review adhered to ri gorous methods, includin g a systematic search strate gy, and explicit inclusion criteria [102]. The findin gs therefore present the most comprehensive and internationally relevant presentin g manifestations for clinicians worldwide. The study has some limitations and potential sources o f bias. The main limitations re flect deficits in the desi gn and reportin g of the included studies. Accuracy o f our systematic analysis depends on the qualit y of the published and supplementar y data that we included. All studies provided data on cases onl y, and not on controls. Therefore, we were unable to compare the frequency of clinical manifestations in CVID patients to the frequency in the general population. Publication bias could have led to overre presentation of more com plex cases of CVID, and therefore hi gher incidences of non-infectious complications. We did not include unpublished data. Hetero geneity between included studies was hi gh. Most included studies provided little motivation for the selection o f the clinical mani festations studied, thus it is di fficult to account with certaint y for the variation in number and choice of the selected clinical manifestations. The variation in reporte d clinica l phenotypes an d comp lications between co horts may stem 169CVID clinical presentation data: meta-analysi s 5from differences in study populations (for instance, due to access to health care, rate at which patients are properly dia gnosed, de gree of consan guinity, or population genetic differences), use of different methods to dia gnose findin gs, underreportin g of histolo gical dia gnoses because biopsies are not performed, and the use of different definitions for CVID. Full consensus regarding the definition of CVID does not yet exist [103]. Also, in a few series, a small proportion of paediatric and adult patients had opportunistic infections and /or a low CD4 T-cell count, and those patients should actuall y be classified as a combined immunodeficienc y. This phenot ype has been re-named in adults as late onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID) by the IUIS. In addition, given the rapid progress in next-generation sequencing, in non-consanguineous populations, a causative mutation may currently be identified in ~25% of CVID patients [104]. Ideally, patients with mono genic diseases and LOCID should have been excluded from our analysis, but it was not possible to identify them exactly in the described cohorts [105]. Transienthypo gamma globulinemia of infancy may have been misdia gnosed as CVID in some of the children included in the different series . As we only included children dia gnosed at a ge >4 years it is unlikely this accounts for a lar ge percenta ge of included children. Implications for future researchp Our study identi fied two key limitations in the current evidence base on CVID presentation. First, we found relatively few studies that explicitly reported data on clinical si gns and symptoms at or before dia gnosis of the disease. We lack data on the frequency and time of onset of symptoms from the first symptoms at home to the final diagnosis. Second, only fewstudies compared paediatric with adult CVID. Further large, multicentre, prospective cohortstu dies, separate ly descri bing c hildren an d wou ld address t hese gaps . Conc lusion s In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms the high frequency of upper and /or lower respiratory tract infections in CVID at presentation, but also shows a remarkably hi gh incidence of severe bacterial infections (osteomyelitis in 4%, in 8%) compared to lifetime prevalence in the general population. This suggests that the incidence o f CVID may also be high in patients with severe bacterial infections without other clear predispositions and su ggests screenin g for CVID mi ght be useful in these patients. These findin gs warrant further exploration. In addition, CVID patients commonl y present with other manifestations than frequent or severe infections - which are not included in ESID and JMF warnin g signs for identifyin g patients with primar y immunodeficiencies. Not only the infectious, but also the immune dysre gulation features (shown in Figure 5.2 ), should alert to the possibility of CVID, re gardless whether they occur with or without recurrent infections. The bimodal sex distribution in patients with CVID implicates that future studies that attempt to de fine mechanisms that underpin CVID should be stratified according to sex.170Chapter 5 REFEREN CES 1.

These patients often remain undia gnosed for years and many present to medical attention in adulthood after several infections risking structural complicati ons. Not much is known about their treatment, comorbidities, or prognosis, nor whether the various immunological forms (decreased totalIgG, IgG subclass(es), IgM, IgA, specific antibody responses, alone or in combination(s)) should be considered as separate, clearly definable subgroups. The unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD ) study aims to describe in detail all PAD patients without an identified t speci fic monogenetic de fect regarding their demographical, clinical, and immunological characteristics at presentation and durin g follow-up. In constructin g these patterns, the unPAD stud y aims to reduce the number of missed and unidentified PAD patients in the future. In addition, this study will focus on subclassifyin g unPAD to support the identification of patients at hi gher risk for infection or immune dysre gulation related complications, enabling the development of personalized follow-up and treatment plans. Methods and analysis y We present a protocol for a multicenter observational cohort study using the ESID online Registry. Patients o f all ages who have given in formed consent for participation in the ESID online Re gistry and fulfill the ESID Clinical Workin or 'common variable immunodeficienc y' will be included. F or all patients, basic characteristics can be registered at first re gistration and yearly thereafter in level 1 forms. Detailed characteristics of the patients can be re gistered in level 2 forms. Consecutive follow-up forms can be added indefinitely. T o ensure the quality of the collected data, all data will be fully monitored beforethey are exported from the ESID online Registry for analysis. Outcomes will be the clinical and immunological characteristics of unPAD at presentation and during follow-up. Subgroup ana lyses wi ll be ma de based on demo graphical, 6INTR ODUCTION Ear-nose-throat (ENT) and lower airway symptoms occur commonly in the general population; they are often, but not always, caused by infection. These infections alread y start early in life, are mostly viral in origin and self-limiting. When symptoms continueto recur, aller gy, asthma, smokin g and/or (in adults) chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease (COPD) can be the underlying cause [1]. Only a small number of patients suffer from too many, too frequent, unusual and/or severe infections caused by inborn errors of immunity (IEI). The majority of IEI patients suffer from predominantly antibod y deficiencies (PAD), which are generally not immediately life-threatening. PADs can be su bdivided into t he rare, more severe, agammag lobulinemias an d hyper-IgM syn dromes, and the less rare hypogammaglobulinemias [2]. The latter may remain undiagnosed for years [2- 5]; however, also these can ultimately lead to important morbidity, irreversible organ dama ge and reduced lifespan when they are not reco gnized and adequately treated in time [6-8]. Traditionally, common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID ) are considered a separate PAD entity, comprising t he most severe hypogammag lobulinemia patients [9,10]. CVID is the most common form seen in specialized centers (estimated prevalence in the population 1: 10.000-50.000 ) [11]. However, even for CVID, expert opinion varies as to which patients with decreased IgG and disturbed speci fic antibody responses should be classi fied under this dia gnosis, some considerin g combination with decreased I gA or decreased I gM su fficient, and others dia gnosin g CVID only in case IgA is decreased (\u00b1y decreased I gM) [12]. Many more patients suffer from less-well described and understood forms of hypo gamma globulinemia: decreased total I gG, I gG-subclass(es), I gM, I gA and/or specific antibodies, alone, or in combination (s) [2]. The International Union o f Immunological Societies (IUIS ) has grouped these cases together in the 'predominantl y antibody deficiencies' section as 'isotype/light chain/functional deficiencies' (with a subdivision base d on immuno logica l laboratory va lues; Table 6. 1) [13]; in the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) Clinical Working Definitions they are divided in separate entities which overlap in part with the IUIS subdivisions ( Tab le 6.2) [14]. However, these PAD cases are often difficult to classif y, either because aspects of more than one subgroup are found within the same patient, or because the patient's immune capacity has not been su fficiently investigated to be positioned in a speci fic subgroup. They are there fore o ften re ferred to as \"other hypogammaglobulinemia\" or - more recently - as \"unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD)\" [1 5]. Within this group, clinical severity as well as the results of immunolo gical laboratory investi gations and potential underlying pathophysiology may differ greatly. Also, different centers are inclined to treat the classification of these patients in different ways, making comparative studies difficult to perform. 208Cha pter 6 Because IEI are rare disor ders, internationa l collaboration is necessary to stu dy these diseases. Since 2004, the ESID has been runnin g an online database for primar y immunodeficiencies: the ESID online Re gistry [16]. This database currently comprises information on more than 30,000 patients with errors of immunity. Documentation is or ganized in different levels. Level 1 is a basic dataset comprising the IEI diagnosis, demographic data, the way to diagnosis (including the presenting symptoms), immunoglobulin replacementtherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy. This level 1 information is meant for documentation o f all patients who gave in formed consent, with yearly concise follow-up documentation. An additional level 2 form was developed for more extensive long - term documentation o f hypogammaglobulinemia patients which comprises a comprehensive dataset with additional items: additional clinical features, current and previous medications, diagnostic vaccinations, virological analyses, instrumental data (lung function, chest HRCT blood cell count, immuno globulins, lymphocyte subsets, auto-antibodies, and further details on therapy. Because of the moderately decreased immuno globulin levels, unPADs are often consi dered to be clinica lly mi lder. However, unPAD-re lated symptoms can lead to decrease d quality of life, loss of participation in society (school, work ) and higher health care costs [6-8,17-19]. These people are often not recognized as IEI patients, because the general public as well as most health care pro fessionals - who are not specialized in immunode ficiency - do not consider IEI in people with recurrent 'normal' in fections. The concomitant fatigue these patients su ffer is o ften considered to be o f psychosocial ori gin or is interpreted as 'chronic fatigue syndrome'. We therefore initiated the unPAD study, based on the ESID online Re gistry, to describe in detail all t ypes of PAD patients without an identified specific monogenetic origin (thust exc luding e.g. X- linked and autosoma l recessive a gamma globulinemia, an d class-switc h recombination defects ) regarding their demographical, clinical and immunological characteristics at presentation and during follow-up, and to identify subgroups based uponthe patterns in these characteristics which can support refining of the classification. By better characterization and classi fication o f the disease, the unPAD study aims to support reducing the number o f missed and unidenti fied PAD patients in the future. T o ensure the quality o f the collected data, all data will be fully monitored be fore they are exported from the ESID online Re gistry system for analysis. In this article, we describe in detail the desi gn of the unPAD study, includin g the strict monitorin g rules, and the planned statistical analysis o f the obtained data. 209The unPAD stud y 6Table 6.1.

The unPAD study aims to characterize all types o f PAD patients withou t an identifiedt speci fic monogenetic origin, i.e. unPAD patients and patients fulfilling the Clinical Working Definition 'common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)' [14]. We will classify all included patients into subgroups with classification te chniques using the demographical, clinical and /or immunological characteristics as directed by the best fit. Finally, we will analyze the predictive potential of demo graphical, clinical and/or immunolo gical characteristics in relation to the occurrence of PAD-related complications such as bronchiectasis or c ytopenias in both our newly defined hypo gamma globulinemia sub groups as well as in the sub groups based on the current Clinical Workin g Definitions . Study questions underlying the level 2 ESID Registry variables yq y g g y A subset o f the members o f the ESID Registry Working Party formulated the research questions underlying the unPAD level 2 forms of the ESID online Registry in (mainly remote ) consensus discussions : 1. What is the clinical presentation o f these patients at dia gnosi s (spectrum, observed prevalence, subgroups, age-related differences) ? 2.What is the immunolo gical presentation of these patients at dia gnosi s? 3. Can sub groups be identified at diagnosis based on clinical and/or immunolo gical characteristics ? 4. What is the clinical presentation of these patients durin g follow-up (spectrum, observed prevalence, subgroups, age-related differences )? 5. What is the immunological presentation of these patients during follow-up ? 6. Can subgroups be identified based on clinical and/or immunological characteristics; if so, is this a stationary classification, or do patients develop from one sub group to another / others with tim e? And in t he long run: 7. What is the prognosis of (subgroups of ) these patients regarding infections, complications, long-term sequelae, li fe expectancy, quality o f life and ability to function in society?213The unPAD stud y 6Patient eligibility gy Before patient data can be entered into the ESID online Re gistry in formed consent has to be obtained. The patient consent forms containin g information on the ESID online Re gistry are available on the ESID website in many lan guages [20]. These forms need to be approved by a competent local Research Ethics Committee according to the regulations of the respective countries and documenting centers before use. Inclusion criteri a 1. The patient (or parents in case of children) has given informed consent for participation in the ESID online Re gistry. 2. The patient fulfils the ESID online Registry Clinical Working Definitions for 'unclassified antibody deficiency', 'deficiency of specific IgG (specific antibody 'CVID' (specified in Table 6.2 ). 3. At least the re gistration set o f both level 1 and level 2 'at dia gnosis' forms has been com pleted. Exc lusion criteri a 1. Refusal of the reportin g physician to have all data that were entered by the center in the ESID online Re gistry checked and - if necessary - corrected under supervision of the unPA Dstudy monitor (s). 2. Patients with an identified monogenetic disease-causing mutation leading toreclassification. Study design yg The is an internationa l mu lticenter o bservationa l cohort stu dy based on the ESID online Registry data. Repeated calls for participation were published in the ESID News letter an d on t he ESID we bsite. Furt hermore, w hen participating centers in dicate d they knew o f other centers who might be interested in participating, we contacted these centers. Until now, 20 centers from 10 countries actively participate in this study by collectin g their data in the level 1 and level 2 forms of the ESID online Re gistry and have a greed to join the study (see list in the acknowledgements). Analyses on variables at diagnosis will be conducted from 2022 onwards. The unPAD study is an on going study, there is still an open invitation for researchers in the field to participate in the study. The unPAD study will be runnin g as lon g as the investi gators expect additional information can be gained from another round of analysis, which will by nature mean a longer follow-up period than in the analyses per formed be fore.214Cha pter 6 Variables at baseline and during follow-up gp F or all patients, baseline characteristics are bein g registered at first re gistration and yearly thereafter in the so-called level 1 forms. The level 1 form contains data on demo graphic characteristics, family history, consan guinity, IEI dia gnosis, and treatment (Table 6. 3). More detailed characteristics of the patients can be registered in level 2 forms, includingdetailed data on demographical, clinical and immunologi cal characteristics, including data on additional investigations, such as lung function, gastroscopy, and Chest CT-scan ( Table 6.3 ). Consecutive follow-up forms can be added indefinitely (shown in S1 Table). T able 6.3. Overview o f variables included in the unPAD study.

Data collection and storage g The registere d patient data are store d on secure servers at t he University Hospita l Frei burg, Freiburg, Germany, using a study code. Data trans fer is SSL encrypted. These pseudonymized data can only be traced back to the patient by the treating physician or documentation specialist o f the center in question, not by the unPAD research team, following the European legal data protection provisions. Identifyin g data (e. g., name, place of residence) are stored on a separate server to which third parties have no access. The s ystem structure o f the ESID online database has been described by Perner et al. and Guzman et al [16,21 ]. Before registration o f patient data is possible, a participatin g center must have si gned a contract and obtained lo gins for the database system. The database is desi gned to be used for lon g-term documentation. It o ffers the possibility to add any number o f visit dates for a given patient. Participating centers are as ked to up date t heir patients' data at least once a year. T he database has an inbuilt automatic quality assurance syst em including field type, range and plausibilit y 218Cha pter 6 checks (e.g., date of death must be later than date of birth ). Some fields are mandatory, which means that data cannot be stored unless these fields are completed. Takin g into account that the data are sometimes not known or currentl y not available to the documentalist, the boxes 'truly unknown' or 'currently unknown' can be chec ked. All patient data collected in the level 1 and level 2 forms will be fully monitored before data extraction for analysis in the unPADstudy. In case of missing data or inconsistencies, the unPAD resea rch team will contact the participating centers to resolve these issues. Sample size p In order to be able to accuratel y describe unPAD patients, we aim to collect data on as man y patients as possible. Based on the amount of registered unPAD patients in the ESID online Registry, we aim to include at least 1,000 patients. This number will allow analysis o f the demographical, clinical, and immunological characteristics (at presentation and during follow-up ) and of the risk of complications in potentially meaningful subgroups. Statistical analysis y Statistical analyses will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics and/or R (most recent versions ). Data quality will be secured by the thorou gh monitorin g process be fore data extraction. After extraction, the data will be cleaned and preprocessed supported b y the standard set of descriptive statistics plus visualization techniques. The most suitable method for dealin g with missin g variables will be determined for each variable in collaboration between data analysts and domain experts (e.g., types of imputation, exclusion from analyses ). We will use cluster analysis (with bootstrapping ) plus supervised and unsupervised machine learning for subgroup classification using all variables together as well as (combinations of ) subsets o f demograp hical, clinica l l characteristics. In a ddition, we wi ll use regression analysis and machine learning to create and evaluate models for predicting health-related outcome variables such as bronchiectasis. A ppropriate evaluation metrics will be a pplied for these mo dels depen ding on t heir type, suc h as R2, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE ), root mean squared error ((R)MSE), and area under the receiver operatin g characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). A p-value <0.05 with correction for multiple testing when appropriate will beconsidered statistically si gnificant, and/or a 9 5% confidence interval (CI) not containin g 0, where a pplicable.219The unPAD stud y 6DISCUSS ION Most hypogammaglobulinemia patients, including those with CVID, still lack a definitive genetic diagnosis. The unPAD study has been desi gned to investi gate 'unclassified antibody deficiency' and has the intention to describe in detail all types of PAD patients without an identified specific mono genetic disease-causin g mutation re gardin g their demo graphical, clinical, and immunolo gical characteristics at presentation and during follow-up. UnPAD patients form a highly heterogenous group and will remain so unless classi fication into clinically meaning ful subgroups can be made. Efforts to strati fy patients into di fferent subgroups according to genetic screening, B- and T-cell studies [22-26] and clinical presentations [27] have been made for CVID patients. A larger group of patients suffers from a range of combinations of immunoglobulin deficiencies where the CVID definition is not met (referred to in the literature as idiopathic hypogammaglobulinemia [28], CVID-like disorder unclassified hypo gamma globulinemia [ 31], and by us as unPA D). However, efforts to stratify patients into different sub groups have not yet been made for these patients. Because these disorders form a hetero genous and phenotypically overlappin g group, correct classification is a real challen ge. It is important to realize that current classifications (ESID Clinical Working Definitions, IUIS ) are mainly based upon the results o f immuno logica l laboratory investigations, w hile it is not c lear how clinically useful such a basis fory classi fication really is. In addition to the current laboratory classi fication approach, we there fore plan a new, broader clinical classi fication approach. By grouping patients also based on clinical presentations and complications, we aim to subclassi fy unPAD patients to support identi fication of those patients with hi gher risks o f complications. These patients could then be monitored for specific complications or be treated differently accordin g to subtype. This will ultimately shed light on more personalized intervention approaches . In addition, the potential identification of more homo genous sub groups can help to unravel the genetic back ground of unPAD patients. This information will help to guide clinicians to answer the question: \" what should I do wit h this individual unPAD patient ?\". This is important. A lthoug h doctors are inc lined to consi der patients wit h hypogammaglobulinemia who do not match the CVID diagnostic criteria to be clinically mild, CVID and unPAD patients comprise phenotypically overlapping groups. On the one hand, the often milder affected 'infection-only' group of CVID patients share very similar disease courses to patients currently classi fied as unPAD. On the other hand, certain subgroups o f unPAD patients suffer from similar immune dysregulation features as described in CVID [15].The unPAD study can improve PAD patient care by identi fying subgroups at risk for serious complications, implyin g different therapeutic consequences for these patients. The unPAD study will be the lar gest study on unPAD patients to date. Of all centers participating in the ESID online Registry, 20 have indicated to participate in the unPAD stud y so far (13 pediatric and 7 adult centers ). Of these, 10 centers have already been fully monitored during a site visit, resulting in 1010 patients who have been monitored at this moment. This 220Cha pter 6 was done as preliminary work to find out whether we would achieve su fficient statistical power. This lar ge set o f patient data provides si gnificant statistical power to not only describe the clinical presentation, pro gnosis, and treatment of unPAD in detail, but also to determine whether sub groups can be identified based on demo graphical, clinical, and immunolo gical characteristics. The unPAD stud y has its limitations. Due to lack of international consensus, the local diagnostical, treatment and follow-up protocols may differ between centers. F or instance, not all patients will have undergone complete pulmonary examinations (e.g., spirometr y and chest HRCT), which may lead to an underestimation of the frequency of bronchiectasis or interstitia l lung disease. T here wi ll be varia bility in data entry practices: e.g. some centers will only record I gA deficiency if patients require active mana gement and the adherence with annual data updating will be dependent on available resources. Moreover, facilities for genetic testin g differ between centers. Therefore, a sub group of patients with a nonidentified genetic dia gnosis may be hidden in the clinically defined unPAD cohort who should actually be reclassified to a mono genetic IEI form. The most important stren gth o f the study is that all data will be monitored and - i f necessary - corrected and supplemented. The use fulness and quality o f data extracted from patient registries depends on correct data entry. It is thus o f utmost importance for the data quality assurance to review and check the data o f any newly added patient. Problems that can occur during registration o f PAD patient data are, for example, entering incorrect numbers o f immuno globulins and lymphocyte subpopulations by typin g instead of 109/l in lymphocyte subpopulations ), misinterpretation of vaccine responses and incomplete clinical manifestations hidden under 'other options'. Furthermore,t he ESID on line Registry can on ly in dicate w hether a gastroscopy or c hest HRCT-scan has been per formed, and i f so, whether the result was normal or abnormal, but the exact findings cannot be registere d in t he system. A monitor site visit provi des t he opportunity to a lso retrieve these detailed data, which can provide very valuable additional in formation . The unPAD study is an on going study and explicitly reaches out to other researchers and clinicians in the field of PAD to join the stud y. This initiative aims to become a platform that facilitates future collaborative research in the field. We expect that our study will give moreinsi ght in the demo graphical, clinical, and immunolo gical characteristics o f unPAD patients and will identi fy which subgroups are at risk for in fections or complications based on immune dysre gulation, enablin g the development o f personalized follow-up and treatment plans.221The unPAD stud y 6REFEREN CES 1. de Vries E.

A qualitative study using the patient perspective230Chapter 7 ABSTRA CT Background g Patients with predominantly (primary) antibody deficiencies (PADs) commonly develop recurrent respiratory infections which can lead to bronchiectasis, long-term morbidity and increased mortality. Reco gnizin g symptoms and makin g a dia gnosis is vital to enable timel y treatment. Studies on disease presentation have mainly been conducted using medical files rather than direct contact with PAD patients. Our study aims to analyze how patients appraised their symptoms and which factors were involved in a decision to seek medical care. Methods 14 PAD-patients (11 women; median 44, ran ge 16-68yrs) were analyzed usin g semi-structured interviews until saturation o f key emergent themes was achieved . Resu lts Being always ill featured in all participant stories. O ften from childhood onwards periods of illness were felt to be too numerous, too bad, too lon g-lastin g, or antibiotics were always needed to get better. Recurrent or persistent respiratory in fections were the main tri ggers for patients to seek care. All participants developed an extreme fatigue, described as a feelin g of physical and mental exhaustion and thus an extreme burden on daily li fe that was not solved by takin g rest. Despite this, participants tended to normalize their symptoms and carry on with usual activities. Non-immunologists, as well as patients, misattributed the presenting signs and symptoms to common, self-limiting illnesses or other 'innocent' explanations.Participants in a way un derstoo d the long diagnostic delay. T hey know t hat the disease is rare and that doctors have to cover a broad me dical area. But t hey were more critica l about t he way the doctors communicate with them. They feel that doctors often don't listen very well to their patients. The participants' symptoms as well as the interpretation of these symptoms by their socia l environment an d doctors had a major emotiona l impact on t he participants and a ne gative influence on their future perspectives. Conclusions To timely identi fy PAD, 'pattern reco gnition' should not only focus on the medical 'red flags', but also on less di fferentiatin g symptoms, such as 'bein g always ill' and 'worn out' and the way patients cope wit h these pro blems. An d, most important, ma king time to rea lly listen to the patient remains t he key.231Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7INTR ODUCTION Rare diseases are defined as occurring in less than 1:2,000 people. However, since there are around 8,000 rare diseases, some 30 million people in both Europe and in the USA suffer from a rare disease. This is an important problem for the patients as well as for the society they live in because rare diseases are often dia gnosed late, especially when they share symptoms with common diseases, leading to delayed and inadequate treatment. As a consequence, these patients su ffer a decreased li fe quality as well as a decreased potential for societal participation (school, work) [1,2]. Predominantly (primary) antibody deficiencies (PADs) are a typical example of such difficult-to-recognize rare diseases [3]. Hypogammaglobulinemias are by far the most common forms of PAD, comprising nearly half of all primary immunodeficiency (PID ) diagnoses [4-6]. Affected persons commonly develop recurrent otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonias can lead to bronc hiectasis, w hich serves as a ne gative factor for lon g-term morbidity and mortality. Since the introduction of immuno globulin replacement therapy, there have been dramatic improvements in survival [7,8]. Reco gnizin g symptoms and making a diagnosis is therefore vital to enable timely treatment. Although PADs are the most common primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs ) in humans, they are still rare with a prevalence o f approximately 1:25,000 to 1:110,000, depending on the type of PAD [3]. These patients often go unrecognized, because the general public as well as most healthcare pro fessionals, who are not specialized in immunode ficiency, do not consider PAD in patients with recurrent \"normal\" in fections. Because o f the variability o f presentin g clinical manifestations, patients visit various ph ysicians of different specialties in search o f a dia gnosis, which increases the risk of missin g the overarchin g clinical pattern and thereby overlookin g the underlyin g hypo gamma globulinemia [9]. Timely dia gnosis and treatment will likely result in improved clinical and quality- of-life outcomes for patients with PAD, higher participation in society (school, work ) and lower healthcare costs [10-15]. Reducing diagnostic dela y is there fore crucial. Studies on disease presentation have mainly been conducted using medical files rather than direct contact with PAD patients. We aimed to explore the presenting pattern of PAD from the perspective of patients and to identif y factors that affect a correct and timel y diagnosis, by exp loring t he perio d leading to t he PAD diagnosis t hroug h narrative patient interviews.232Chapter 7 MATERIAL S AND METH OD Design and setting gg Patient experiences re gardin g their journey to receivin g a dia gnosis and adequate clinical care are best understood via an in-depth qualitative approach. Through individual semi-structured interviews with patients who had a dia gnosis of PAD, new insi ghts derived from their perspective were sought. Their experiences and reasoning regarding complaints and the diagnostic delay they su ffered were explored. New interviews were conducted until saturation o f key emergent themes was achieved, meaning additional interviews were no longer adding new themes to the data set. Methods and results are reported according to the COREQ checklist [16]. Populationp Participants were recruited by an email sent by the Dutch patient organization for primary immunodeficiency diseases to all their members ('Stichtin g voor Afweerstoornissen', SAS ). The email invited the members to partici pate in an interview of about one hour at a place of their choice and stated that it would be audiota ped. All partici pants provided written and audio in formed consent. The interviews were primarily with study participants but the contribution o f a relative, i f present, was also welcomed. Data collection The interviews were performed in October and November 2016 at the patients' homes. The interviews were conducted b y a master student in the last year of medical education (KvA ). Questions were semi-structured, designed to address those items which the interviewer wished to raise, and also allowing participants the freedom to express their own perspective and to offer an opportunity for serendipitous findin gs. The questions (overview in Supp lementary T a ble 7.1 ) were based on the literature related to clinical characteristics of primary antibody deficiency [9,17-19] and to psychosocial theories relatin g to symptom appraisal and care-seekin g [20]. All interviews were reviewed and discussed with an experienced medical immunolo gist with expertise in qualitative methods (EdV). Data analysis y All interviews were audiotaped and literally transcribed (KvA and MAB ), and analysed usin g the framework method [21]. Data were anonymized by removin g any information that could identi fy the patient. Transcripts were read and re-read to ensure familiarization, and independently coded (MAB and LJ). The codin g was reviewed by a third coder (EdV), to ensure that the type and range o f codes applied was appropriate and consistent. The coding lists were used to develop a framework organized into categories. In total, we identified 154 codes we divided into 11 categories, which were organized in 3 themes (Supp lementar y 233Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7Table 7.2). The codin g was finalized usin g the software packa ge Atlas.ti Version 7.1. 5 (Berlin, Germany ), and the coded data were exported (MAB ). This export was read, re-read and then summarized for each of the 14 participants of the study. Each cate gory was then interpreted usin g an analytical memo to explore emer ging themes and concepts.234Chapter 7 RESULTS In total, 14 participants were interviewed. Interviews lasted from 45 to 105 minutes. Eleven women and three men participated, median a ge 44 years, ran ge 16-68; all participants were Dutch. Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 7. 1. Three interviewees were accompanied by a relative durin g the interview. The results are presented under subheadings reflecting the main steps in the diagnostic pathway, namely: presentation of PADand participants' interpretation o f symptoms, progression o f symptoms and realization that something is really wrong, starting the patient journey, doctors' interpretation o f symptoms, and triggers to diagnosis. Participants were also asked to reflect on care provision and on the emotional toll of the diagnostic process. Presentation of primary antibody deficiency and participants' interpretation of symptoms py y y p p p y p The presenting features o f PAD described by participants were diverse, intermittent and sometimes non-specific, coverin g a broad ran ge of behavioural and physical chan ges (T able 7.1). Being galways ill featured in all participant stories. It often occurred from childhood y onwards and was considered to be a problem by participants and/or their parents when periods o f illness were felt to be too numerous, too bad, too lon g-lastin g, or when antibiotics were a lways nee ded to get better. Then I got my penicillin course, then it was over within two days, but then the penicillin course was over again and two days later it started all over again. (Participant 4) Many participants thought recurrent infections to be normal for children, or in some cases due to atopic disease. Seven adult participants just felt ill and did not have a particular explanation for why they were more often ill than others but assumed that the symptoms wou ld pro bably reso lve wit h time. Participants ten ded todownplay py and/or y norma lize their symp toms. When it started with asthma, I had two to four respiratory tract in fections a year. That's not very stran ge, it is not what strikes you as abnormal if you have asthma. (Participant 9 ) I think everybody cou ghs sometimes with a little mucus, but then I don't feel very sick. Usually, it resolves with time. Eventually, when I was dia gnosed with CVID, they did a Chest- CT . Then they saw the be ginnin g dama ge that fits the clinical picture and lun gs. They also said: 'how is that possible, you said you only had pneumonia once, but from lookin g at the scan it seems as if it really cannot have been just once'. (Participant 10 )235Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7F atigue g was present both before and after the diagnosis in many participants and was described as a feelin g of physical and mental exhaustion and thus an extreme burden on dail y life. Most participants recalled that the y slept ver y well, but still remained tired. The decrease in ener gy level could result in the need for an afternoon nap. And really a lot of fatigue, I slept for three hours during the day and ten hours at night. I really slept thirteen to fifteen hours a day. Just to keep up. (Participant 1) I spoke about it with my sister recently. I always thou ght, everybody works the whole day, five days a week, but I actually can't do that. It would tire me so badly, it's not possible. (Participant 6 ) Participants descri bed they t hought they exerte d themse lves too muc h, causin g their symptoms themselves by workin g too hard, takin g care o f their whole family or by bein g too active socially. The de gree o f fatigue could be si gnificant be fore the participant really labelled it as a problem. Eleven participants reported their fatigue was so severe it took away all their free time, because after a work /school day there was no ener gy left for social activities. Then I sleep the whole night, being just able to fulfil the expectations set during the day. I don't have any free time le ft, because when I come home, I go to sleep, and then anothe r day begins. (Participant 10 ) Participants had comorbidities, complications or misdiagnoses, and tended to attribute their symptomsyp to these conditions. F or example, a participant with iron deficiency anaemia attributed her fatigue solely to this condition, and a participant with Graves' disease attributed her fatigue solely to that. Whereas in both participants these conditions could well be complications o f their - unreco gnized - PAD. Another participant with a misdia gnosis of asthma thou ght her fatigue was the result o f needin g more potent inhalers. In total, four participants (1, 7, 9 and 12) attributed their symptoms to asthma. At that time I got dia gnosed with asthma, for which I had to use inhalers that just did not work. (Participant 7 ) Participants carried on with their usual activities despite significant limiting symptoms. Just tired... I always went to work anyway, ...what good is it to you to lie down on the couch all day. (Participant 4 )236Chapter 7 T able 7.1. Symptom attribution and delay be fore dia gnosis.

At one point it became less and less due to fati gue. That I just couldn't mana ge to exercise for an hour at ei ght o'clock in the evenin g. Sometimes I had to force myself to do it, but then I just took an extra puff, so I could do it a gain. (Participant 1) Often, unusual and alarming signs for PID were not recognized as unusual medical conditions by g the consulting doctors, for example: ITP , alopecia areata and recurrent in fections in participant 3; recurrent chicken pox in participants 8 and 9; excessive oral aphthous lesions in participant 10; recurrent menin gitis in participant 5; recurrent otitis in adult patients repeatedly needin g tympanostomy tubes in participants 1, 2 and 8; excessive wei ght loss in participants 1 and 4; salpingitis after swimming in participant 6, and impaired wound healing in participant 9 . Progression of symptoms and realization that something is really wronggy p g y g Typically, the symptomatology evolved over weeks to months, with non-speci fic earl y features such as recurrent \"normal\" in fections, fever, chronic cough and fatigue, mimicking those o f common, sel f-limiting illnesses. Some participants described a triggering event (thyroid disease, pregnancy, weight loss or severe wound infection after caesarean section ) as starting point for a sudden increase in infections. Symptoms often progressed over time pg . Infections slowl y became abnormall y recurrent, severe and /or persistent. It starts with only periods of cou ghing and then at one point it's actually all the time. (Participant 3) F our participants (4, 6, 8 and 12 ) suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis and underwent sinus surgery. This resulted in only a short relie f of complaints. In the sons o f participant 8, multiple sinus sur geries were per formed in addition to weekly nasal irri gation and polypectomy. The ENT specialist was alarmed by their voluminous medical file. But the ENT-specialist told us: 'you are ri ght, at the whole ENT-department we have nobod y with a file as lar ge as those of your sons'. We came there for only three years. He said: 'those files are now already bi gger than the files of a fifty-year old'. (Participant 8 ) Nine participants (1, 3-6, 8, 9, 12 and 14) recalled their infections only resolved with antibiotic treatmen t. As soon as I got my anti biotics intravenous ly in t he hospita l, I recovere d. So everyone was like, you're fine again, you can go home. So yeah, it was okay for a while, only after fou r episodes o f six days, so four weeks o f illness, they wanted to conduct further research. (Participant 1 )239Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7Partici pants o ften recalled a patternp in the complaints. In participants 1 and 12 the upper respiratory tract infection (otitis, pharyn gitis and/or sinusitis) always pro gressed to a lower respirator y tract infection. It progressed from an infection of the sinuses, to the ears and then to the throat and airways. (Participant 1 ) It often be gan with infections: lun gs, sinus, yes very often my sinuses, and then it spread to my lun gs and throat at the same time. (Participant 12) F our participants (1, 2, 3 and 8 ) repeatedly developed otitis - often after swimming - in adulthood and were treate d wit h tympanostomy tu bes. Well, I mean, everybody mi ght have an ear in fection once a while, but every time I had it, it lasted a month. That I really had so much pain for a month, that you just wanted to hi t your head a gainst the wall, because you don't know what to do about the pain anymore. Then the doctor told me: 'yes, but antibiotics do not help a gainst an ear infection, so I do not really want to give that'. Then it lasted just really lon g every time, but the GP did not think: 'oh, that is weird'. (Participant 3 ) Participants 7 and 9 realized they differed from other people when comparing the duration of recovery . I often had a cold. Another person had it for two days and i f I had it was for two months. (Participant 7 ) I played handball and that is not a 'sweet' sport, to be fair, my wounds recovered badly... That was very weird, the wound always got in fected or it took four weeks to heal. With the other kids in m y environment the wounds alwa ys recovered within a week or two. For me never, it always took longer. (Participant 9) Participant 6 recalled her infections to start rapidl y and become severe in a short time. It could be that one moment I thou ght: 'I'm going to make it', but then an hour later I would be so ill that I didn't make it. (Participant 6 ) The burden of infections was perceived to be susceptible to change. Participants pointed out that they experienced positive as well as negative fluctuations in the burden of infectionsdue to weather conditions: four patients reported being sick throughout the year (1, 2, 4, 8 ); three patients were almost never ill during the summer (5, 6, 9).240Chapter 7 All except two participants were wor king age an d initia lly thought that their symptoms were a normal part of their busy lifestyle and job, but once recognized as abnormal by others gy (employers, collea gues) they sou ght help. F amily members often witnessed participants stru ggling with symptoms and encoura ged them to seek help. Five participants (1, 2, 4, 5 and 7) often recalled that their social environment thought they were sicker than they admitted themselves. I just went to my job, I have often been sent home by my boss. (Participant 1) That's also what my colleagues said, how often I was at the office with a sinusitis or otitis, that everybody was like: 'you shouldn't do that, you're ill'. Yes, I am very often ill, this isn't even tha t bad. (Participant 1 ) Most participants were quick to seek medical advice from their GP as soon as they realized something was really wrong. However, it took most participants a long time to realize this; they g continue d to hope t hat the symptoms wou ld simp ly disappear . Starting the patient journey gp j y The factors which triggered the seeking of care were various. One patient sought help because gg g of the psychological stress she suffered due to the many unexplained symptoms. Recurrent or persistent in fectious episodes like recurrent otitis, sinusitis, or pneumonia or endless coughing, were the main triggers for patients to seek care. O ften the fatigue and strain o f coping in li fe while hindered by all the symptoms were the reason to go - a gain - to the GP . Combinations of problems could also be the final push. Partici pants re porte d cumu lative barriers that led to delays to seek help. Their interpretation of the initial si gns and symptoms o f the disease in fluenced whether they sou ght help. Participants either got use d to their symptoms or hope d their symptoms wou ld pass by. At a certain point you raise the bar and think by yourself: 'I am not usin g medicines or visit the doctor a gain'. You think: 'I just keep takin g pills'. Then you raise the bar a gain and wait and see for another day. (Participant 1 ) Well, in t he beginnin g you go to t he doctor... But w hen you are a lways i ll, you just don't go to t he doctor anymore. (Participant 3) Others no lon ger sou ght help because the healthcare pro fessional only treated symptoms instead of searching for the cause. Be fore the CVID diagnosis was made in patient 8, he underwent recurrent sinus surgeries resulting in only short relief of the (chronic ) sinusitis. These experiences kept him from seeking help after a while. Another theme that emerged was feeling delegitimized gg .241Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7This led them to feel distressed by the way they were treated, by not bein g believed or listened to and not bein g able to cope with symptoms. Participants reported the feelin g that both healthcare professionals and others did not see them as havin g a le gitimate illness and that the credibility o f their symptoms was frequently questioned. Patient 3 reported that her symptoms were for a lon g time attributed to an unacknowledged mental health condition and which made her feel that the symptoms were not due to an underlying pathology. I went to the doctor, who thought: 'I think it's not that bad how o ften you are sick'. So then she said: 'I think it is how you experience it, that it is in your head, but not real'. So then she initially referred me to a psycholo gist. (Participant 3) Over time, having healthcare professionals questioning their credibility made participants question the legitimacy o f their symptoms too. Participants described feeling guilty for wasting healthcare pro fessionals' time, or downgrading their symptoms by normalization, waiting till another in fectious episode passed by. Once patients began to see k a diagnosis, delays a lso occurre d wit hin the healthcare system. Clinicians were not o ften familiar with PID and were challenged by the complexity and rarity o f the disease. This impacted their ability to make a di fferential dia gnosis. Sometimes healthcare professionals seemed to have difficulties in abandonin g an initial dia gnosis. Participant 6 was treated for bacterial pneumonia, but her general state of health worsened with loss of condition, leadin g to the inability to climb the stairs. She su ggested herself to screen for possible PID because of recurrent Hemophilus Influenzae pneumonia despite adequate antibiotic treatment, after which CVID was discovered. In addition to ph ysician inflexibilit y, this case reveals the importance of communication concerning symptoms from everyday life as well as medical symptoms. Six participants (1, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 14 ) recalled their social environment forming a barrier in seeking help. The social environment o f these participants downplayed the participants' complaints. The y attributed the symptoms to stress/a busy life or told the participants it would resolve with time. 'It is probably because of the stress', people say that a lot too. (Participant 10 ) Doctors' interpretation of symptoms py p Many participants recalled initially being offered an incorrect explanation for their symptoms py p (Table 7.2 ). Most doctors initially attributed the participant's symptoms to minor, viral illnesses, asthma, anatomica l ENT-pro blems or to ot her 'innocent' exp lanations suc h as ascri bing joint pains to sporting activities, episodic dyspnoea to stress-induced hyperventilation, feeling worn out to the combination o f working too hard and taking care o f a newborn child, erythema nodosum to mos quito bum ps and exercise intolerance to meno pause. In one partici pant XLA, despite a positive famil y histor y, was onl y discovered years after he alread y had several episodes of meningitis. In one participant, her symptoms were put down to being pregnant.242Chapter 7 Participants were referred to several different specialists p (Table 7.2), often only after stron gly insistin g on it. In two participants, their symptom attribution to psycholo gical factors, led to multiple visits to a ps ychiatrist. I did not have severe infections, but I couldn't do anything anymore. Well, what happens then: 'psychic, menopause, divorce'. I started believing that after a while. Then I went to a psychiatrist. I went there for years. (Participant 14) Two participants (2 and 8) appeared to have one or more decreased immuno globulin isotypes years before the final diagnosis, but this was not noticed by the doctor or the doctor did not know what this meant and ignored the results. This reflects the problem that most non - immunologists have minimal or no knowledge of PID. Even treatment failure - implying an g unusual disease course - did not alarm an ENT specialist to think o f potential PID. I had menin gitis in 2011 an d then I recovere d and they t hought it went better, but t hen I became sic k again. T hen I went to t he ENT- doctor... T hey c leane d my sinuses. T hat was February 2012. Then I became sick a gain, they didn't understand it anymore. Then I ended up in the hospital a gain in April. (Participant 4 ) Triggers to diagnosisgg g In none o f the participants, the s ymptoms were attributed to potential PID b y the GP , except for one participant, in whom his children were already diagnosed with PID. Only two participants were referred directly to an immunolo gist, where referral immediately led to a correct diagnosis. Two participants were diagnose d throu gh a positive family y history y, although one of them had already suffered a meningitis eight times (which had yy not tri ggered the potential dia gnosis ). In two participants (2 and 11 ) PID was incidentall y discovered while screenin g for celiac disease (low serum I gA). Multidisciplinary consultations can support the diagnostic process. In participant py 10, who had splenomegaly, erythema nodosum and pancytopenia, one o f the specialists reco gnized the symptom pattern and su ggested to test ld me: 'I actua lly don't know w hat you have, I t hink it's sarcoi dosis, but your blood doesn't s how t hat'... 'I'm going to discuss you one more time in a multidisciplinary consultation, i f we don't find it then, then we really don't know'. In that consultation I think one smartass said: 'test for antibodies'. (Participant 10 ) Alarm symptoms can trigger the diagnosis. F or example, healthcare professionals were yp triggered to conduct additional investigations when participant 1 and 4 suffered from excessive weight loss. Sometimes PID was diagnosed while searching for another243Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7diagnosis. Participant 1 su ffered from wei ght loss, ni ght sweats and splenome galy and was screened for leukaemia or l ymphoma. Instead, she was found to have CVID. Participant 3 suffered from idiopathic thrombocytopenia and alopecia and was screened for some form of autoimmune disease. Her I gG was found to be decreased instead of elevated; she was diagnosed with CVID . They started searching for an autoimmune disease and they determined the total serum IgG level. They expected that to be super high, because they thought o f lupus or something like that. But it was very low at that time. (Participant 3) Abnormal symptom patterns can trigger the healthcare professional to conduct further yp p investigations. In participant 9 the ENT specialist noticed inflammation on the inside of t he nose, usua lly in dicating a llergic r hinitis. However, a llergy tests were negative an d anti histamines, nasa l corticosteroi ds an d turbinate re duction did not a lleviate her symptoms. This triggered the ENT specialist to re fer to an immunologist. When I entered, he inspected my nose and said: 'this is what an aller gic nose looks like'. I said to him: 'you can say that, but nobody can prove that I have aller gies'. Then they cut it out and cleaned it, but I kept having a lot of complaints. Then he started to look further. (participant 9 ) The paediatric PID patients had a shorter diagnostic delay than the adult PID patients in our pp study. Participant 7 su ffered from recurrent otitis, rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as chronic cou gh, skin abscesses, pneumonia and failure to thrive since birth and was dia gnosed with hypo gamma globulinemia at the a ge of 5 (durin g follow-up a dia gnosis of unclassified primar y antibody deficiency was made ). The sons of participant 8 were dia gnosed with CVID by their paediatrician, tri ggered by recurrent need for tympanoplasty and sinus sur gery. While their father had severe and recurrent in fections for several years, he was only dia gnosed with CVID a fter this was discovered in his two children. Participant 9 and 14 played a direct role in obtaining their PID diagnosis by searching for a cause of their symptoms on the internet and diagnosing a potential PID by themselves gg p y . Participants in a way understand the lon g diagnostic delay. They know the disease is rare and a GP has to cover a broad me dical area. T hey rea lize t he diagnostic delay is due to not knowing, instead o f not wanting to know. It is o f course so rare. There are so many things that doctors should be aware o f that I understand that it has not been directly diagnosed. (Patient 1 ) I don't blame her, because you can't know everything, but I thought: 'Gosh, I felt reall y miserable then'. (Patient 2 )244Chapter 7 But participants are more critical about the way the doctors communicate with them. y They feel that doctors o ften don't listen ver y well to their patients. The y want the doctor to acknowled ge they don't know what is the matter and to refer the participant to a specialist, and to observe existin g guidelines. The stupid thing is that there is a pulmonology guideline for recurrent airway infections. According to the protocol he had to make a referral. He didn't know that but then at least be honest enough to say that you don't know. (Participant 9) Emotional toll of the diagnostic delay gy During t he interviews it became increasing ly clear t hat the participants' symptoms as we ll as the interpretation of these s ymptoms b y their social environment and doctors had a major emotional impact. Finally knowing they have probably had PAD for years without jp being diagnosed also negatively impacted their lives. Participants recalled feeling a lack of understanding by their social environment, who o ften questioned or downgraded their comp laints. Well I didn't think it was hard to accept the fatigue and just go to bed. It was o ften more the incomprehension of others, like: 'Gosh, already? We just started'. (Participant 1) Then they think: 'there she comes again, she is sick again'. (Participant 4 ) Eight participants stated that their symptoms had a negative influence on their future perspectives. Struggling with their untreated symptoms they made di fferent choices in their career pat hs or were hampere d in getting promote d. It always got in the way o f everything. Because he was really good at his job, he would be promoted, but then he was ill a gain. So another person got the job. That was always ver y depressin g. (Wife of participant 8 ) In others, symptoms prevented them from doing what made them happy, because they felt themselves to be a burden for their social environment. Concerts, yes I love that. I didn't do that in a lon g time, because it is the worst annoyance o f every orchestra member when somebody is cou ghing in the hall. (Participant 6 ) I haven't, for example, been on vacation for years. I very o ften felt that I was a burden for other people. When we went on vacation and I was sick again, that's not what you want. (Participant 6 )245Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7Many participants reported that fatigue ne gatively in fluenced multiple aspects o f their social network. They o ften could not participate in social activities due to fatigue or had to deal with the consequences of takin g part in social activities by sleepin g all next day. This led to social isolation and feelin gs of loneliness. Every time they say: 'we can't come'. At seven o'clock they lie in bed and their friends go out. So then you won't be asked anymore. (Mother of the sons of participant 8, who also have CVID) You always have to disappoint people because you have to drop out last-minute. That's why a lot of CVID patients get isolated, because at some point, you don't want to disappoin t people anymore. (participant 8 ) The daily limitations due to the PAD-related complaints were a heavy mental burden for many participants.

This is important, because recurrent respiratory infections and fatigue are much more prevalent withou t concomitant PAD [22]. Participants in this study t tended to normalize their symptoms and carry on with usual activities. Copin g strate gies of the extreme fatigue that PAD patients develop therefore differ from those with chronic fatigue syndrome, because patients with chronic fatigue syndrome often use escape/avoidance strategies [23]. Also, PAD patients reported to sleep well, whereas chronic fatigue patients generally report more difficulty falling asleep and interrupted sleep [24]. In addition to these non-me dical aspects, participants reca lled many me dical aspects t hat cou ld trigger suspicion for potential PAD: infections being unusually frequent and /or severe, not clearly season-bound, requirin g antibiotics to clear. Many participants underwent repeated sinus surgery, tympanoplasty and/or polypectomy, at best only temporarily resultin g in relieve o f symptoms. These aspects are in fact already known, but their relevance is often missed in everyday practice. Therefore, to timely identify PAD, 'pattern reco gnition' should not onl y focus on the medical 'red flags', but also on less differentiating symptoms, such as 'beinga lways i ll' and 'worn out' an d the way patients cope wit h these pro blems. An d, most important, making time to rea lly listen to t he patient remains t he key. A wide range o f factors a ffected the speed and accuracy o f diagnosing PAD. First and foremost, both patients and non-immunolo gist healthcare pro fessionals tended to persist in misattributin g the presentin g signs and symptoms to common, sel f-limitin g illnesses or other 'innocent' explanations. Both patients and non-immunolo gist healthcare professionals initiall y attributed \"bein g always ill\" and \"feelin g worn out\" to 'doin g too much' or 'sleepin g too little', or to medical conditions such as nasal pol yps, nasal septum deviation, asthma or chronic rhinitis. The prevalence of most presenting symptoms of PAD in the general population is high. A population prevalence of 11% is for instance reported for sinusitis, and in a s ymptom prevalence stud y 28% of patients experienced coughing in the previous 7 days, and 11% had experienced fatigue [25,26]. This can explain why 'normalizing' prevalent symptoms such as fatigue or recurrent in fections is so widespread. The normalization of symptoms and symptom misattribution to less serious or pre-existin g conditions have been reported to account for appraisal delays in various cancers, particularly when the early symptoms were commonly occurring non-speci fic symptoms (eg, fatigue) [27,28]. Remarkably, also the appraisal of less common and more alarming signs, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), excessive oral aphthous lesions, recurrent otitis repeatedly needin g tympanostomy tubes in an adult, did not alert both patients and health care professionals to potential underlyin g disease. Participants were referred to multiple physicians before a diagnosis was made, intensifying the time o f worrying and wondering. These findings highlight an important knowledge gap among general practitioners and non-immunologist hospital doctors regarding the clinical presentation of 257Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7PAD. Education campai gns that address this issue could reduce the time between the onset o f symptoms and treatment. In addition, multidisciplinary consultations (MDC's ) with a number of specialists workin g together can support the dia gnostic process for patients presentin g with non-specific symptoms who have visited multiple physicians [ 30]. It would be interestin g to explore health care professionals' views about PAD and about recognizing rare disease. This would help to reveal what health care professionals need to be able to use this knowledge in their own practice. A second major theme was an increasing reluctance to seek care, albeit in some participants more than others. Reasons for this were diverse. They included getting so used to symptoms that they were considered to be 'normal', the feeling o f not being taken seriously, and opposin g 'just bein g treated for symptoms anyway' instead of bein g investi gated for their cause. The quality of the doctor-patient r elationship had a significant impact on the process of obtainin g a correct dia gnosis. A GP's prior view of a patient as bein g 'thin-skinned' or 'a worrier' could influence how seriously they investi gated their complaints. These two themes highlight the full ran ge of factors potentially influencin g a timely dia gnosis, rather than the presentin g medical features o f the underlyin g disease alone. All this led to a signi ficant mental burden for the participants. The period prior to the diagnosis was particularly challenging, with people feeling dismissed by health care professionals, in spite o f their distress. The lack o f a de finitive diagnosis not only le ft them open to sel f-doubt, but also to the negative judgements o f others including family, friends and employers. This concept is not unique to PAD as other conditions which are challen ging to diagnose, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), elicit similar 'journeys'. In patients with SLE, the perception of bein g dismissed and of the lackin g of empathy from a health care professional has been described as leadin g to feelin gs of emotional ne glect [ 31]. Participants in this stud y reported relief when the y found a name for their s ymptoms after the y had spent years fighting searching for that. Although the PAD diagnosis helped them by legitimizing their symptoms, validating their suffering and improving their emotional status by being believed and listened to, they still had to cope with the burden of their disease and its treatment forthe rest o f their lives. While it has already been shown that PAD can result in a considerable disease burden [14,32 ], our qualitative study adds the perspective of the patients themselves. Participants found the impact o f being 'always ill' and 'worn out' on their daily functioning to be a key factor determinin g their emotional well-bein g. They experienced serious limitations in their social functionin g, causin g social isolation and feelin gs of loneliness. This is in line with results from a previous study on COPD-related fatigue, which stated that fatigue influences physical, co gnitive, and psycholo gical functionin g [33]. Another study related fatigue to perceived health and concluded hi gher fatigue correlated to a lower perceived health [34]. Other pathologies, such as different t ypes of cancer, showed fatigue being a driver in the impact of quality of life in patients [35-37 ]. These results highlight the need for more attention to the potential patient burden in the diagnostic delay of PADs. 258Chapter 7 Limitations Because o f the relatively small sample, whilst the size o f the sample is in keepin g with the in-depth nature of qualitative research, this explorative stud y should perhaps be validated b y future studies. The sample included patients who had been dia gnosed some years previously. This may have contributed to recall bias. Nevertheless, the study produced a rich amount o f material and the findings provide insight into areas of potential future research. Conclusion This study revealed non-medical patterns that can help to reco gnize patients with potential PAD. With in-depth interviewin g, it became clear that - althou gh fati gue can be one of their major complaints - these patients are different from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: patients wit h PAD ten d to norma lize t heir symptoms an d carry on wit h usua l activities. T he difficulty experienced by clinicians, as well as patients, in recognizing unusual and alarming signs an d attri buting symptoms correct ly, illustrates t hat non-immuno logists have little knowled ge of PAD. This is not surprisin g, since PAD is a rare disease. Althou gh this underlines the importance o f education pro grams, which should not only focus on the medical 'red flags' of PID, but also on copin g strate gies o f more common, less di fferentiatin g symptoms, such as 'bein g always ill' and 'worn out', this cannot be the final solution. It is impossible for non-experts to know about all >8,000 rare diseases. Hope fully, modern developments in automated pattern reco gnition can be developed to offer 'red fla gs' in the electronic patient file that alert a physician to potential underlying problems. The results obtained in this study can support the design o f predictive models in this regard. 259Identification of primary antibody deficiency: qualitative stud y 7REFEREN CES 1.

A decision tree based on the 23-valent pter 8 CT Aim Recently, the 2 3-valent I gG-assay was su ggested as screenin g assay to identify poo r responders to pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS)-vaccination with the serotype-specific assay as a second-line test. However, in a low pre-test probability general hospital settin g predicting good responders could be more valuable to reduce the number of samples needing serotyping . Methods Serotype-specific PnPS antibody-assays were performed for suspected two general hospitals (Jeroen performed in archived material. Data were analysed using receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC ) and agreement indices (ICC ). Results Sera of 284 patients (348 samples ) were included; 2 3-valent I gG-titres and the correspondin g sum of PnPS-serotype specific antibodies showed moderate correlation (ICC=0.6 3). In 232 conju gated-pneumococcal-vaccine-na\u00efve patients (270 samples ), a random 2 3-valent IgG-titre could discriminate between samples with and without 7 /11, 7 /13 or 6 /9 pneumococcal serotypes when both cut-off values and were used (AUC 0.86 and 0.92, respectively ). All 38.2 \u00b5g/ml and /or post-immunisation-titre 96.1 \u00b5g/ml and none with a post-immunisation-titre 38.5 \u00b5g/ml exhibited a goo d response to PnPS vaccination. Using t hese breakpoints as screening test to predictgood responders, only 24% of patients would require further serotypin g, as opposed to 68% if break points to predict poor responders wou ld have been use d. Conclusion In a low pre-test probability setting, the 23-valent IgG-assay proved to be a reliable screeningtest for good responders in conju gated-pneumococcal-vaccine-na\u00efve patients, reducin g the overall number o f patient samples needin g further serotypin g, thus reducin g overall costs of pneumococcal vaccination response assessment accepted as the ' gold standard' [1-4] for the evaluation of anti-polysaccharide antibod y production capacity in patients who are suspected to have primary antibody deficienc y because of unexplained or recurrent (mainly respiratory ) infections [4, 5]. However, serot ype- specific PnPS testing is not widely available and is time consuming, labour intensive andex pensive. Moreover, uni form re ference values are not available, and inter pretation is therefore challenging [6-10 ]. Recent data has indicated that one-step measurement of the summated response to all 23 serotypes present in the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (here called \"23-valent IgG assay\" ) could be used as a screening test to reduce the overall number of patient samples needin g serotypin g [11,12 ]. This could si gnificantly improve efficiency and reduce overall costs. In addition, t his assa y is wi dely avai lable as in- house assa y or eas y-to-use commercia l kit, an d the test result is easy to interpret based on a sin gle cut-off value [13]. Given t hese a dvanta ges, the 2 3-valent I gG assay has been proposed to be used as a first-line test to identify clear-cut poor responders, and the serotype-specific assay as a second-line test for assessment of the PnPS vaccination response in non-c lear-cut cases on ly. In t heir tertiary-centre a dult co hort (n=62 ), Lopez et al. identified a cut-off value of 110 \u00b5g/ml, which was constantly associated with a poor response to PnPS vaccination using the serotype-specific assay [11]. However, on a population basis - i.e. in the context o f a low pre-test probability settin g - a screenin g met hod that can re liably pre dict good responders could be o f greater value. After all, man y patients with recurrent infections do not have an immunodeficienc y. Or the y suffer from milder forms of hypo gamma globulinemia such as selective anti-polysaccharide antibody deficiency (SPAD ) only (or combinations with I gG-subclass and/or I gA deficiency ), without significantly decreased total immunoglobulin levels. These patients generall y present themselves in secondar y care, where the pre-test probabilit y for severe antibod y deficiency is inherently low. However, even milder hypogammaglobulinemia can lead to serious problems, requiring adequate medical attention [14]. These milder patients are o ften not recognized due to lack of available test facilities in secondary care, and reluctance to refer many patients to an immunolo gist. Easy, reliable selection of patients can create support for a lower screening threshold for antibody de ficiency in patients with recurrent in fections in secondary care. Ultimately, this will help timely detection o f all patients who do have an immunode ficiency. Our study was designed to investigate the suitability o f the one-step summated res ponse test for this purpose.274Cha pter 8 MATERIAL AND METH ODS Study design yg Between F ebruary 2012 and December 2018, serotype-specific PnPS assays were performed on 348 blood samples in regular patient care, obtained from 284 patients who were analysedfor potential immunodeficiency in two secondary centres in the Netherlands Bosch Hospital, 's-Hertogenbosch (n=234), Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital, Tilburg (n=50)). Of these, 78 samples were from 64 patients who were previously vaccinated with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Pn-C). Left-over samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C and later retrieved from the laboratory to perform 23-valent pneumococcal IgG assays. The research project was grante d ethical approva l by the loca l me dical ethics committee an d consent was o btaine d from all adults and parents o f the children. Test met hods The Clinical Re ference Standard The I gG antibodies a gainst PnPS were measured on a Luminex platform usin g a multiplex Hospital, this serotype-speci fic assay was per formed in the Department of Medical Immunology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands. Titters were assessed against eleven serotypes (1, 3, 4, 2014, Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital, this assay was per formed in the St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwe gein, the Netherlands. In this laboratory, titres were assessed against thirteen serotypes (1, 3, 4, a subset of these samples (n=1 32), 22 of the serotypes present in the 2 3-valent I gG assay (all except 17F ) were determined. F or the interpretation of PnPS serotype concentrations two different thresholds were used: 0. 35 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ ml (based on protection a gainst invasive infection and colonization, respectively )[10,16- 19]. F or both limits, sufficient levels were defined in vaccine-na\u00efve patients as 7 /11, 7 /13 or 6/9 serotypes reaching these concentrations (based on the reference values of the respective laboratories). In 174/284 (61%) patients a blood sample was drawn 4-8 weeks after intramuscular vaccination with one dose of 2 3-valent PnPS vaccine (Pneumovax 2 3; Merck, Sharp & Dohme Haarlem, The containin g 23 specific capsular polysaccharide of 23 pneumococcal serotypes nomenclature). A positive response to PnPS vaccination was de fined according to the guidelines o f the laborator y (17,18 ). Brie fly, a good response to PnPS vaccination was de fined by a post-immunization titre 1.0\u00b5g/ml in 7 /11, 7 /13 or 6 /9 serotypes in patients not previously immunized Pn-C vaccine. In Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients, the serot ypes not present in the vaccine were evaluated (Utrecht; when vaccinated with Pn-C7, serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7F; vaccinated g 23-valent Nieuwe gein; Accordin g to the Utrecht laboratory's reference values, we corrected for a ge in these samples: for a ges 4-6 years, an abnormal result was defined as < 50% of serotypes evaluated reachin g an I gG titre of 1 \u00b5g/ml. F or age 6 years, an abnormal result was defined as <75% of serotypes evaluated reaching an IgG titre of 1 \u00b5g/ml. According to the Nieuwegein laboratory's reference values, an abnormal result was defined as < 70% of serotypes evaluated reaching an IgG titre of 1 \u00b5g/ml in those samples. The Index Tes t F or the measurement of the 23-valent IgG titre, the VaccZym eTM anti-P CP Ig G ELI SA Kit (The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom ) with precoated microtiter plates was used accordin g to the manu facturer's instructions [22,2 3]. anti-cell wall polysaccharide (CPS ) eTM anti-PCP IgG assay was Microbiolo gy and Immunolo gy at the Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital (Tilbur g, the Netherlands ). Statistical analysis y Data were analysed usin g SPSS 24.0 software for Mac. Differences in measurements were tested with t test (Welch's t test when the variances are unequal) and ANOVA. Separateanal yses were performed for patients previousl Pn-C. Correlation between the 23-valent IgG titre and the sum o f the serotype-speci fic antibody titres in the same sample was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC ). The strength of the relationship for the ICC coefficient r was classified as follows: 0. 3 r < 0. 5 'poor', 0. 5 r < 0.7 5 'moderate', 0.75 r < 0.9 ' good' and 0.9 r < 1.0 'exce llent' [24].

All tests were two-tai led and p-values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically signi ficant. 276Cha pter 8 RESULTS Participants p 127/284 (4 5%) patients were females, and the mean a ge at inclusion was 36.3 years (ran ge 1.1-89.7). In 54 patients, two or more different samples were available, resulting in 348samples with paired serotype-specific and 2 3-valent pneumococcal I gG titres available for from patients previously immunized with Pn-C vaccine).O f the 270 samples from patients not previously immunized with Pn-C vaccine, 194 were pre-immunization samples, 38 were 4-8 weeks post-immunization samples, and 38 were > 8 weeks post-immunization samples (mean duration after vaccination 33 months, range 15-70 months ). Of the 78 samples from patients previously immunized with Pn-C vaccine, 63 were pre-immunization samp les, 14 were 4-8 wee ks post-immunization samp les, an d 1 was a > 8 weeks post-immunization sample (28 months ). T est results In all samples taken to gether, a moderate correlation between the sum of the individual PnPS serotypes and the 2 3-valent I gG titre in the same sample was observed (ICC = 0.6 5, 95% CI = 0. 57-0.72, P<0.0001; Figure 8.1A ). The ICC did not improve when the sum of a lar ger set o f 22 individual PnPS serotypes was plotted against the 23-valent IgG titre (available for 132 samp les; ICC 95 % CI = 0.49-0.75; ). Patients not previously immunized with conjugated pneumococcal vaccin e First, all samples from patients not previously immunized with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine were analysed together, irrespective o f whether the patients had received PnPS- vaccination. The 23-valent IgG titres were significantly higher in samples with 7 /11, 7 /13 or 6/9 serotypes above both the cut-off levels 0. 35 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, compared to samples with < 7/11, < 7/1 3 or < 6/9 serotypes above these cut-off levels (p<0.0001 for both cut-off ;Figure 8. 2). A 2 3-valent I gG titre could discriminate between samples with and without 7/11, 7/1 3 or 6/9 serotypes above both the 5), respectively; Figure 8.2 , Table 8.1]. Based on the calculation of the Youden index, the best threshold was a 23-valent I gG titre o f 38.2 \u00b5g/ml for cut-off of 0. 35\u00b5g/ml and 54.2 \u00b5g/ml for the cut-off level 1.0 \u00b5g/ml.

This is clinically the most interesting evaluation. Sixty (41% ) patients were defined as poor responders according to the serotype-specific assay. F or both 23-valent pre- titres a signi ficant di fference was observed between good and poor responders (p<0.0001; Figure 8.3 ). The results of ROC curve analyses of the 2 3-valent I gG assay performance vs. the serotype-specific assay per patient are shown in Figure 8. 3 and Tab le 8.2. Because Cohen's kappa was never better than moderate (<0.75), this ruled out the use of the 2 3-valent I gG assay alone and implicated the necessity o f a stepwise approach. We wanted to establish whether use o f the 23-valent IgG assay alone could reliably discriminate good responders, who do not need any further dia gnostic work-up, as well as poor responders, whom we do not want to miss. We therefore favoured a hi gh sensitivity for pre-immunization titres, and both hi gh specificity as well as hi gh sensitivity for post-imm unization titres.

Antibody levels a gainst individual serotypes di ffered considerably, with serotypes 14 and 19F being dominant in most cases (Figure 8.5 ). On average, antibodies to individual serotypes contributed to the total 2 3-valent I gG titre ran ging from 1.1 - 7.6% in pre - immunization samples, and 1.1 - 14.7% in post-immunization samples. In pre-immunizationsamples, serotype 14 contributed si gnificantly more to the 2 3-valent I gG titre compared to serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7, 9, In post-immunization samples, no be identified (analysis of variance; F=1.291, p=0.20 ).

In these two samples, the pre-immunization sample where serotype 19F dominated (7 3% of 3-valent I gG titre), had 4/1 serotypes and 2/13 serotypes 1.0 g/ml.

The 23-valent IgG titres were higher in samples with 2-3 /4, 2/3 or 4 /6 serotypes above both the cut-off levels of 0.35 and 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, compared to the samples with < 2-3 /4, < 2 /3 or < 4 /6 serotypes above these cut-off levels (p=0.01 3 for the cut-off level of 0. 35 \u00b5g/ml, and p=0.0 58 for the cut-off level of 1.0 \u00b5g/ml; Supplementary Fi gure 8.2 ).

The 23-valent IgG assay is widely available and easy to interpret. Implementin g this procedure in general hospital care could lower the threshold for timely detection of primary antibody deficiency (PAD) by reducing the overall number of patient samples needing serotypespeci fic antibody measurement, thus reducing overall costs. It is important to realize that recent studies focusing on using this assay as a first-line test were used to screen for poor responders to PnPS vaccination in highly selected patient populations referred to tertiary immunode ficiency expert centres [11,12 ]. Bot h approac hes are va luable, but eac h should be used in the appropriate settin g only. We found that a cut-off value of 38.2\u00b5g/ml in the pre-PnPS-immunization 2 3-valent IgG assay could reliably predict good responders in our cohort of conju gated-vaccine-na\u00efve patients. This cut-off value is hi gher than the lower limit of the normal ran ge (10.0, 11.0, and 15.4\u00b5g/ml ), and just below the means (41.0, 45.8, and 59.5 \u00b5g/ml) found in 3 previous studies of healthy vaccine-na\u00efve adults using the same assay as our study (13,23,25 ). A post-PnP S- immunization threshold o f 38.5 \u00b5g/ml yielded 100% specificity in conjugated-vaccine-na\u00efve patients. This cut-o ff value is below the lower limit o f the normal range post-vaccination (50 and 77 \u00b5g/ml) found in 2 studies of healthy unvaccinated adults usin g the same assay as our stu dy [27,29] , and similar to the cut-off value ( 40 \u00b5g/ml ) used by the Utrecht group [12,22 ]. It is also lower than found in a previous study by Lopez et al, were a 2 3-valent I gG titre of 110 \u00b5g/ml yielded a specificity of 100% and predicted 57% of the poor responders to PnPS vaccination [11]. However, our data are not easil y comparable to those of Lopez et al., as different sets and numbers of serot ypes were tested in the serot ype-specific assa y, the criteria to define a deficient response were different, and, most important, they investigated a highly selected patient population o f which 75% was diagnosed with a humoral immunode ficiency. In contrast, good responders predominated in our general population cohort. This againemphasizes the importance of fitting the screening approach to the appropriate setting. The performance of the 2 3-valent I gG assay with previous studies [11,28,30]. In Pn-C pre-vaccinate d patients, both pre- an d post-23-va lent IgG titres were simi lar in good and poor responders. This is in a greement with previous studies, in which it has been shown that the 2 3-valent I gG assay could not discriminate between good and poor responders to PnPS-vaccination in Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients [12,31]. Since a majorit y of childhood vaccination programs now include Pn-C vaccination, and a 20-valent conjugated vaccine is currently investigated with the intent to broaden global protection against pneumococcal286Cha pter 8 disease, the future value o f the 2 3-valent I gG assay as screenin g method for SPAD will probably become limited. Recent results show promisin g results for the measurement o f the Typhim Vi I gG response as a dia gnostic tool for assessin g polysaccharide production in Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients [ 32]. The WHO recommended assay for measuring serotype-specific PnPS antibodies is b y ELISA. A growing number of clinical laborat ories, including ours, now are using multiplex bead technology for this purpose. The correlation between the two types of assays is good,although there can be variation in the absolute concentrations measured. It has beenevaluated whether this variation would a ffect response classi fication o f patients when using clinica l sera [33]. It was conc luded despite variation in a bsolute va lues of pneumococcal antibodies, the overall classification of the pneumococcal immune status of the patient was remarkabl y similar between assa ys [33,34 ]. In a recent publication it has been su ggested to adjust multiplex cut-off values of selected polysaccharides to improve agreement level with WHO ELISA [ 35]. Our stu dy has severa l limitations. First, a high 23-valent I gG titre correspon ding wit h a good PnPS vaccination response by the serotype-speci fic assay may nevertheless not be protective because t he anti body has low avi dity or low opsonop hagocytic activity. However, t here are current ly no accepte d clinica l criteria regar ding norma l PnPS-vaccination response based on measurements other than serotype-speci fic PnPS concentration [3 ]. For future studies, it would be interesting to compare the 23-valent IgG assay with functional opsonopha gocytosis assays. Second, correlation between the 2 3-valent I gG titre and the sum of individual PnPS serot ypes ma y be explained b y the use of serot ype- specific results expressed as 'hi gher than' (for example >10 \u00b5g/ml ). Determination of the exact concentration b y titration of the sera, which has not been performed in this stud y, may resu lt in a better a greement between both assays. It has long been reco gnize d that the 23-valent IgG assay is of limited value in patients where isolated, elevated serotype titresare responsible for a high 23-valent IgG titre. While this may be true for selected patient co horts, in a genera l patient popu lation suc h as ours, t his turns out not to be the case. In on ly few samples (19/270 pre-immunization and 4/38 post-immunization), an isolated serotypecontributed more than IgG titre, and a high 23-valent IgG titre was never present in the four post-immunization samples and only in 2 /19 pre-immunization samples. Unfortunatel y, these two patients were not vaccinated, so it cannot be excluded that the y could be incorrectly classi fied as 'expected to be a good responder' by our decision tree. Last, it should be pointed out that in our per patient analysis, post-immunization samplesobtained > 8 weeks a fter vaccination were excluded. The number o f those sam ples was too low to per form a meanin gful comparison. In conclusion, this is the first study evaluating the application o f the 23-valent IgG VaccZymeTM anti-PCP I gG ELISA Kit for predictin g good responders to PnPS-vaccination in a general hospital patient population setting. We showed that this assay can be a first screening287Decision tree gG-assa hich patients in a genera l hospita l settin g do not need serotype-specific testing.

It is not yet known whether an isolated inability to mount a normal IgM or IgA-PnPS response should beconsidered a relevant primary antibody deficiency (PAD ). We studied the clinical relevance of anti-PnPS IgM and IgA-assays in patients with suspected primary immunodeficiency in a large teaching hospital in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. fic-PnPS later anti-PnPS IgM-assays were performed in archived material 304 samples ). 11/65 pre-immunisation post-immunisation good responders to PnPS-serotype-specific IgG-testing, had decreased anti-PnPS IgA and / or I gM-titres. Of these, three pre-immunisation and no post-immunisation samples were from patients previously classified as 'no PAD'. Determination of anti-PnPS I gA and I gM in addition to anti-PnPS I gG did not reduce the need for serotype-specific-PnPS I gG-testin Our data show that patients, classified as having an intact antibody response based on measurement o f serotype-speci fic-PnPS IgG, still can display impaired anti-PnPS IgM- and IgA-responses, and that the additional measurement o f anti-PnPS I gA and I gM could not reduce the need for serotype-speci fic IgG-testin g. Future studies are needed to investi gate the clinical relevance of potential 'specific I gA- or I gM-antibody deficiency' in patients with recurrent airway infections in whom no PAD could be dia gnosed accordin g to the current definitions .295PnPS I gM and I gA assay 9INTR ODUCTION Specific antibody deficiency (SPAD) is defined as the inability to mount an IgG antibody response to purified Streptococcus pneumonia e capsular polysaccharide anti gens in the presence of normal immunoglobulin concentrations and normal antibody responses to protein anti gens [1]. SPAD was first reported in a small group of patients in the early 1980s [2, 3]. Patients with SPAD suffer from recurrent ear-nose-throat (ENT airway infections with encapsulated bacteria. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS ) antibodies can be measured as the cumulative titre of antibodies to all 23 serotypes present in the PnPS vaccine (hereafter called \"anti-PnPS IgG is expensive, not widely available, and interpretation o f the results has proven to be challenging [7,8]. The anti-PnPS I gG assay has been shown to be a reliable screenin g test for poor [9] as well as for good [10] serotype-specific PnPS I (Pn-C ) vaccine na\u00efve g serotype-specific PnPS I gG testin g, thus reducin g the costs while maintainin g the quality o f the diagnostic assessment for potential SPAD. The cumulative PnPS antibody response can also be measured for IgM and IgA type antibodies, but this is not routinely per formed for the assessment o f immunocompetence or risk of pneumococcal infection [11-14 ]. Anti-PnPS IgA and IgM antibody responses have been investi gated in healthy donors [12-14], patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID ) [11,1 5], patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD ) [16], and children with transient hypo gamma globulinemia of infancy (THI) [17]. The anti-PnPS I gA and IgM assays identify CVID patients with greater risk of infectious and non-infectious (autoimmunity, enteropathy ) complications [11,1 5,16,18] and predict the disease course in young children diagnosed with antibody deficiency [19]. However, it is unknown whether an iso lated ina bility to mount a norma l IgM or IgA PnPS response s hould be consi dered a clinically relevant PAD. Theoretically, such speci fic IgM or IgA antibody de ficiencies could be clinically relevant, because IgM and IgA are predominant immunoglobulin isotypes in theupper and lower airways with different effector mechanisms than IgG [20,21]. In this study, we investi gated the clinical relevance of anti-PnPS I gM and I gA assays in addition to the anti-PnPS IgG assay, when analysing patients for potential PAD in a general hospital population. Our first objective was to investigate whether there were patients in our cohort with recurrent ENT and /or respiratory tract infections labelled as 'no PAD' based on a good response in serotype-specific PnPS I gG assays [10] with a reduced anti-PnPS I gA and / or IgM response. Second, we investi gated whether addin g anti-PnPS I gA and/or I gM assays to the anti-PnPS IgG assay could reduce the need for serotype-specific 296Cha pter 9 MATERIAL S AND METH OD Study design yg Anti-PnPS I gA and I gM assays were performed on 304 blood samples, obtained from 240 patients in regular patient care who were analysed for the potential presence of primar y immunodeficiency (PID) in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital (JBZ) in 's-Herto genbosch, the Netherlands, between F ebruar y 2012 and December 2018. Of these, 61 samples were from 49 patients who were previously vaccinated with the Pn-C vaccine. Residual samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C and later retrieved from the laboratory to per form anti-PnPS IgA and IgM assays between September and November 2019; anti-PnPS IgG assays were previously performed (and published ) between August and September 2018 [10]. Most patients (n=84 ) were diagnosed with unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD ): deficiency of IgG, and/or combination(s) of deficiency of I gG-subclass(es), I gM, I gA or specific antibodies. Thirteen patients were dia gnosed with common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID ), four with selective I gA deficiency (sIgAdef ), three with selective I gM deficiency (sIgMdef ), two with transient hypo gamma globulinemia of infancy (THI ), four with another type of PID than PAD, one with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV ), eight with secondary immunode ficiency. In 87 patients it was concluded that they did not have a PID; in 34 patients there was no de finitive diagnosis because o f incomplete data. High-resolution CT (HRCT ) scans were available for 68 patients; these were scored by a thoracic radiologist accordin the \"Chest CT in ADS\" criteria [2 3]. The study was granted ethical approval b y the local medical ethics committee and written in formed consent was obtained from all adults and parents of the children . Met hods ELISA for the quantification of anti-PnPS I gG, IgM, and I gA Commercially available ELISA kits (VaccZymeTM pneumococca l capsu lar po lysacc haride ELISAs, The Binding Site Group Limited, UK ) were used to measure anti-PnPS IgG, IgM and IgA according to the manu facturer's instructions. Absorption o f inter fering anti-cell wall polysaccharide (anti-CWPS) antibodies was incorporated in these assays. Cut-offs used for Pn-C vaccine-na\u00efve patients were the lower limit of the normal range (LLNR ) as determined by Parker et al. in healthy adults (pre-immunisation: anti-PnPS I gG 10 g/ml, anti-PnPS to measure serotype-speci fic IgG PnPS as previously adsorption to block anti-CWPSantibodies [4]. F or assessin g the response to PnPS vaccination a blood sample was drawn 4-8 297PnPS I gM and I gA assay 9weeks after intramuscular vaccination with one dose of 2 vaccine (Pneumovax 23; Merck, Sharp & Dohme BV, Haarlem, The Netherlands). A good response to PnPS vaccination was defined accordin g to the international consensus response criteria [24] . Statistical Analysis y Data were analysed using SPSS 27.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphpadPrism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) for Mac. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for unpaired comparisons of anti-PnPS IgG, IgA, and IgM titres in: 1) pre- and post-immunisation samples (often both were not available from the same patient ), 2) poor and good responders to PnPS vaccination as determined by the serotype-specific assay, 3) patients with and without PAD, and 4 ) patients with and without bronchiectasis. Separate analyses were per formed for patients who were previously immunised with Pn-C vaccine. Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was estimated to determine the linear association between t he anti-PnPS IgG, IgM or IgA titres an d serum immunog lobulins. T he resu lts were interpreted accordin g to the de gree of association as stron g (r = 0.7-1), moderate (r = 0.5-0.7), or low (r = 0.3-0.5) after taking significant correlation values ( p((< 0.0 5) into consideration. In order to be able to compare anti-PnPS I gA and I gM I gG in our dataset were standardised by convertin g them into z-scores. T o determine whether the sum of anti-PnPS I gG, IgA and /or IgM titres could better predict whether that patient was a good or a poor responder to PnPS vaccination as assessed b y the serotype-specific assay, compared to the anti-PnPS IgG titre alone, receiver operating characteristics (ROC ) curves were plotted and the areas under the curves (AUCs ) were calculated. This was done separately for pre- and 4-8 weeks post-immunisation titres. All tests were two-tailed and p-values <0.0 5 were considered to be statistically si gnificant.298Cha pter 9 RESULTS The baseline characteristics of the 304 blood samples, obtained from 240 patients, are summarised in T able 9. 1. The a ge-specific responses to PnPS vaccination are shown in Supplementary Figure 9. 1 for vaccine-na\u00efve patients and in Supplementary Figure 9. 2 for pre-immunisation titres of Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients. titres pre-immunisation and >8 weeks post-immunisation were lower in patients aged 61-80 years, compared to patients aged 0-20 years ( p =(( 0.0001 and p= 0.0002 , respectively). Age did not influence the anti-PnPS IgA or IgG response in this vaccine-na\u00efve patient cohort with suspected PID. In Pn-C pre-vaccinated patients with suspected PID there was no significant difference between the pre-immunisation anti-PnPS IgM, IgA and IgG titres at 1-2 years of age and 8 years of age ( p = (( 0.54 6, p =0.497 an d p = 0.999, respectively ). Because of too few data of post-immunisation titres in Pn-C- pre-vaccinated patients, this analysis could not be done for post-immunisation titres in this group. Comparison of all cumulative antibody tests in all samples py p Spearman's corre gG an gA (r =0.52, p < 0.0001 ), while a poor correlation was observed between anti-PnPS IgM and anti-PnPS IgA (r = 0.39, p < ) lementary Figure 9.3 ). There was a moderate correlation between anti-PnPS IgM and the serum IgM level (r =0.54, p < 0.0001; Supp lementary Figure 9. 4). Poor correlations were found between anti-PnPS I gA and serum I gA (r = 0.38, p < 0.0001) ( r =0.03,p = 0.665). As expected, IgA and IgM deficient patients did not produce anti-PnPS I gA or I gM, respectively. Patients previously classified as no-PAD based on their IgG response only py g p y T o investi gate whether patients from our cohort with recurrent airway infections who had been classified as 'no PAD' based on normal serotype-specific PnPS I gG vaccination response and normal serum immuno globulin levels, could have defective anti-PnPS I gA and/or I gM responses, pre- and post-immunisation anti-PnPS I gA and I gM titres were divided into four groups (I gA/IgM both decreased, only I gA decreased, only I gM decreased and I gA/IgM both norma l; Figure 9.1A an d B). Eleven of 6 5 pre-immunisation samples and 6 of 10 post- immunisation samples from patients with a good response to PnPS serotype-speci fic IgG testin g, had decreased anti-PnPS I gA and/or I gM titres. Of these, three pre-immunisation samples and none o f the post-immunisation samples were from patients who were previousl y classified as 'no PAD' (Figure 9. 2). The data therefore indicate that up to 60% (6/10 ) of patients with an adequate anti-PnPS IgG response, still can display de fects in the ability to generate a sufficient anti-PnPS IgM and /or IgA response.299PnPS I gM and I gA assay 91 10 100 10001101001000 anti-PnPS I gA (U/ml)anti-PnPS I gM (U/ml)post-immun isation levels 0.1 1 10 100 10001101001000 anti-PnPS I gA (U/ml)anti-PnP S IgM (U/ml)pre-immun isation levels A B Figure 9.1.

Also, in patients of whom both pre- and post - immunisation samples were available, the concentration increase from pre- to 4-8 weeks post-immunisation was signi ficant for anti-PnPS IgG and IgA, but not for anti-PnPS IgM (Supplementary Figure 9.5 ).

Comparison of patients with and without PAD pp Pre-immunisation anti-PnPS IgG, IgA, and lower in Pn-C vaccine na\u00efve patients with PAD, compared to those without PAD (Supp lementar y Table 9.1 A). This comparison could not be made for post-immunisation anti-PnPS I gG, IgA, and I gM titres, because on ly one patient did not have PAD. Pn-C vaccine na\u00efve patients wit h PAD had significantly more o ften pre-immunisation anti-PnPS I gG and I gM titres below the LLNR, compared to patients without PAD (Supplementar y T able 9.1 B). In addition, a number of PAD patients had post-immunisation anti-PnPS I gG (16/2 3, 70%), I IgG, IgA, and IgM titres were not statistically different between patients with and without PAD (Supp lementar y Table 9.1 C). This comparison could not be made for post-immunisation titres, because there were on ly two post-immunisation samp les in t he Pn-C pre-vaccinate d patient group. Comparison of Pn-C vaccine na\u00efve patients with and without bronchiectasis pp The prevalence o f bronchiectasis was identical in patients with post-immunisation anti-PnPS IgA or IgM titres above and below the LLNR (75% in all categories).

Our data show that patients, classified as havin g an intact antibody response based on measurement of serotype-specific PnPS IgG, still can display impaired anti-PnPS IgM and IgA responses. Isolated decreased anti-PnPS IgM and in particular anti-PnPS IgA response might have clinical relevance. Decreased anti-PnPS IgA and IgM responses have been reported in healthy adult blood donors [12,13], but have also been associated with a greater rate of respirator y infections in patients with CVID [11,15] and PAD [16]. In patients with recurrent ENT or airwa y infections in whom no PAD could be diagnosed according to the current standards, the clinical relevance of isolated decreased anti-PnPS I gA and/or I gM responses has not yet been investi gated. In t his stu dy we measure d anti-PnPS I gA an d IgM leve ls in or der to determine whether - in addition to 'specific I gG antibody deficiency' - 'specific I gA or I gM antibod y deficiency' mi ght be a clinically relevant form of antibody deficiency. None of the patients with a decreased anti-PnPS IgM or IgA response had been classified as 'no PAD' based on serotype-speci fic PnPS IgG testing and serum immunoglobulin levels. There fore, we could not determine its c linica l relevance based on our data. T o gain further insight in the clinical relevance o f anti-PnPS IgA and IgM assays, we investi gated whether a dding these he anti-PnPS I gG assay cou ld reduce t he nee d for the more expensive and difficult to interpret serotype-specific PnPS I gG testin g [10]. ROC analysis showed the discriminative power of the anti-PnPS I gG assay alone to detect good responders was superior to any other combination. Therefore, based on our data, it does not seem useful for a clinician in a general hospital to request anti-PnPS I gA and I gM assays in addition to anti-PnPS IgG assay in order to reduce the need for serotype-specific PnPS IgG testing. Comparison with existing literature pg Previous studies have reported conflicting results concerning the correlation betweenPnPS responses for all three immuno globulin isotypes with their respective serum levels. Similar to our results, poor correlations were found in a health y population b y Parker et al. [13] and a PAD cohort by De Carlos et al. [16]. In contrast, Cavaliere et al. did find a significant correlation in a CVID cohort [11]. By definition CVID patients have decreased IgM and/or IgA concentrations, and a signi ficant proportion would have decreased anti-PnPS IgM and IgA responses. T his mig ht exp lain t he goo d corre lation between PnPS responses an d their respective serum lobulins in CVID patients, w hich is not expecte d in 'mi lder' PAD patients or a health y population.304Cha pter 9 In contrast to Cavaliere et al. we did not find a hi gher bronchiectasis prevalence in patients with impaired anti-PnPS I gA and I gM responses [11]. However, while our cohort included patients with unPAD and milder forms of CVID with an 'infection-onl y' phenot ype, Cavaliere et al. mainly included severely affected CVID patients with immune dysre gulation complications. Also, our results might be biased towards a higher bronchiectasis prevalence, because HRCT scans were only performed in patients in whom pathology was expected. Previous studies have reported on the influence of age on the anti-PnPS IgM and IgA response in healthy adults and highlighted the importance o f age-speci fic re ference ranges. Park, Parker and Ademokun et al. reported that older adults (>60 years) had lower anti-PnPS IgM and IgA responses compared to younger adults [13,22,26 ]. We did find that with increasin g age the pre-immunisation titres of anti-PnPS I gM antibodies were lower, but in our cohort of patients with suspected PID we did not find lower anti-PnPS IgM and IgA responses with increasin g age. Our results, however, represent a mixture of patients with and wit hout PAD wit h both norma l and impaire d anti-PnPS I gG, IgA an d IgM responses. Future stu dies in large healthy adult popu lations are nee ded to improve t he evi dence on age-speci fic re ference ran ges for pre- and post-immunisation anti-PnPS I gM and I gA titres. The higher pre-immunisation anti-PnPS IgM titres in t he PCV prime d pae diatric group, compared to the unprimed adult group can be due to lower age and the di fferent immunogenicity o f PCV. Contrary to the unconjugated PnPS vaccine, PCV induces a T-dependent, more pronounced memory response. A single dose o f PCV is able to induce a significant I gM response measurable 1 month after vaccination [27]. It would be interestin g to investi gate this issue in prospective cohort studies comparin g PCV primed and unprimed groups. Limi tations Our stu dy has severa l limitations. First, t he timepoint to ta ke post-immunisation samp les 4-6 weeks after vaccination may be adequate for I gG and I gA antibodies, but I gM antibodies could already have been declinin g. This could explain our findin g that, in vaccine-na\u00efve patients, good serotype-speci fic PnPS IgG responders showed a signi ficant anti-PnPS Ig A and I gG rise, but not a si gnificant anti-PnPS I gM rise. Parker et al. also reported a hi gh percenta ge of healthy individuals with decreased anti-PnPS I gM concentrations 4-6 weeks post-vaccination [1 3]. In contrast, Sch\u00fctz et al. found that in healthy adults anti-PnPS I gM titres reached its maximum 3-4 weeks post-immunization, and remained at a plateau for 3 months [14]. Second, anti-PnPS I gA and I gM were only measured in blood, not in mucosal tissues or secretions. While the pneumococcal conju gate vaccine (PCV) and PnPS vaccine after priming with PCV have been shown to be able to induce protective mucosal IgA antibodies[28,29], it is unknown whether this also occurs after immunisation with PnPS vaccine alone. Most in fectious pathogens enter the host via mucosal sur faces, where mucosal IgA 305PnPS I gM and I gA assay 9represent the hallmark of immune responses [30]. In future studies it would be interestin g to investi gate anti-PnPS I gA responses in both blood and mucosa l tissues to learn more about the clinical relevanc e of a defective anti-PnPS I gA response in the circulation . Conclusion and implication for future research p Our study shows that patients classi fied as having an intact PnPS antibody response based on measurement o f IgG antibodies, still can display de fective anti-PnPS IgA and IgM responses. In addition, we show that the additional measurement o f anti-PnPS IgA and -IgM could not reduce the need for serotype-specific PnPS I gG testin g. However, our sample size was too small to draw any definitive conclusions on the clinical relevance of our findin gs. Future studies are needed in patients with recurrent ENT or airway infections in whom no PAD cou ld be diagnose d accor ding to t he current stan dards, to investigate w hether - in a ddition to 'speci fic IgG antibody de ficiency' - also 'speci fic IgA or IgM antibody de ficiency' can be a clinically relevant form o f antibody de ficiency .306Cha pter 9 REFEREN CES 1.

Such infections by themselves are generally innocent and self-limiting; only in a minorit y of patients are they a si gn of underlyin g primary immunodeficiency (PID). Of all PIDs, hypogammaglobulinaemias form the largest group, but they are still quite rare, which makes diagnosis challenging. However, diagnostic delay may be critical for patients, as they ma y not receive appropriate treatment in a timely fashion, resulting in irreparable organ damage such as bronchiectasis. An important reason for diagnostic delay is the poor specificity o f initial presenting symptoms, which are not recognised as indicators of potential underlying hypogammag lobulinaemia. Even w hen t hese patients are immuno logica lly screene d, investi gations are often incomplete. some of the immunolo gical laborator y investi gations are difficult to interpret and non-immunolo gists often have little knowled ge about these tests. T o complicate thin gs further, the definition of antibody deficiency depends on the local or re gional reference ran ge applicable to the patients and full international consensus regarding the definitions of the different forms of hypogammaglobulinaemia does not exist [1] . The aim o f this thesis was to improve earlier detection o f hypogammaglobulinaemia by investigating 1 ) clinical presentation patterns of single and multicentre cohorts of patients with hypo gamma globulinaemia and 2) easier-to-interpret dia gnostic tests. Our meta - analysis reveals the importance o f includin g immune dysre gulation features to the currently existin g infection-centred warnin g signs for hypo gamma globulinaemia. In addition to these medical aspects, non-medical aspects, such as copin g strate gies of patients who are help globulinaemia dia gnoses 'only innocent and self-limiting infections' (but not recognising the importance o f their recurrence ), or chronic fatigue syndrome (based on the 'worn out' feeling of afflicted patients ). Our decision tree, which uses the more widely available and easy-to-interpret 23-valent pneumococcal IgG assay as a first-line specialised serotype-speci fic assay as a second-line test, can be used as a reliable screening tool to identify patients with deficient pol ysaccharide antibod y responses.316Cha pter 1 0 ON HYP OGAMMA GLOBULINAEMIA Primary care physicians, internists, and paediatricians are in the best position to initiate diagnostic evaluation of potential hypo gamma globulinaemia. Their awareness of this rare condition is therefore critical to reduce diagnostic delay [2]. The Jeffrey Modell F oundation (JMF) developed 'the 10 warnin g signs' of PID in an attempt to promote awareness and facilitate early recognition of PIDs; these have been revised twice, most recently in 2010 [3,4]. There are two versions, resulting from expert consensus: one for children, and one for adults. The warning signs focus on the type, number, severity and localisation o f infections, their response to therapy and impact on growth, and on the family history. In spite of these warning signs, delayed diagnosis of PID remains a problem. The JMF warning signs o f PID are mainly in fection- focussed, while other symptoms may be more prominent at first, such as autoimmune manifestations, and l ymphoid or granu lomatous diseases [ 5,6]. Data from the national French PID re gistry e. g. showed that 26% of PID patients had experienced at least one manifestation of immune dysre gulation durin g their lifetime, of which autoimmune cytopenias and inflammatory bowel disease occurred most frequently [7]. Maurac her et a l. showe d that immune dysregu lation can a lso be the only mani festation o f PID without any signs o f infection [8 ], and Thalhammer et a l. showe d that an exclusive focus on in fection-centred warning signs would have missed around 25% of PID patients [9]. The mu lti-stage diagnostic protoco l, deve lope d by the Clinica l Wor king Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) includes the non-infectious manifestations; it takes the clinical presentation o f the patient as startin g point [10]. Eight different clinical presentations determined by the underlyin g patholo gy of the disease were identified by expert consensus. Next to infection-focussed presentation patterns (recurrentENT and airway infections, recurrent pyo genic infections, unusual infections or unusuall y severe course of infections, recurrent infections with the same type of pathogen ), this protocol includes autoimmune or chronic inflammator y disease as a clinical presentation pattern [10,11 ]. Adding immune dysregulation mani festations to the JMF warning signs has been suggested by several studies, but these suggestions were not speci fically investigated in hypogammaglobulinaemia patients [2,12-14 ]. In chapter 5, we assessed initial clinical manifestations in CVID patients in a meta-anal ysis. We demonstrated that also in CVID patients other presenting manifestations than frequent and /or severe infections often occur, such as lymphadenopathy (27%), splenomegaly (13%), infectious but also the immune dysre gulation features should therefore alert to the possibility of CVID, re gardless of whether these features occur with or without recurrent infections. However, with the awareness of the full s pectrum of all possible medical presentation patterns, we are not there yet. F or example, recurrent upper/lower respirator y tract infections are much more pre valent without concomitant hypogammaglobulinaemia. 317General discuss ion 10Inchapter 7 we sho w that strate gies o f hypo gamma globulinaemic patients developed to cope with the recurrent in fections and extreme fatigue di ffer from those o f patients with chronic fati gue syndrome [16]. While patients with chronic fati gue syndrome often use escape / avoidance strate gies, patients with hypo gamma globulinaemia tend to normalise their symptoms and carry on with usual activities [16,17 ]. This example shows that to timel y identify hypogammaglobulinaemia 'pattern recognition' should not only focus on the medical'red flags', but also on information outside the medical domain such as these coping strategies o f PAD patients who present being 'always ill' and 'worn out'.318Cha OGAMMA GLOBULINAEMIA The term CVID was introduced in 1971 to distinguish patients with less well-de fined hypogammaglobulinaemia from those with a consistent clinical phenotype [18]. However, the definition of CVID remains a topic of ongoing debate. Disagreement exists about whether or not to include a mandatory decrease in I gA in the definition of CVID [1] and about the a pproval of reduced (switched) memory B lymphocytes as an alternative criterion to conclude vaccine responses are im paired [19,20]. A range of other combinations of antibody deficiencies where the CVID definitions are not met can be encountered (decreased total IgG, IgG-subclass(es),IgM, IgA and/or specific antibodies alone or in combination ). Various terminologies have been used for such patients in the literature, also depending on their degree o f perceived disease severity: i diopat hic primary as 'unclassified primary antibody deficiency' (unPAD ). While the clinical spectrum of CVID has been investi gated in depth (reviewed in chapter 5), there are relatively few reports on patients with these milder forms of hypo gamma globulinaemia who show clinical features reminiscent of CVID to a greater or lesser extent. This ne gatively affects this group of hypo gamma globulinaemic patients who are in fact much more o ften encountered in clinical practice. On t he one hand, patients wit h subnorma l immuno globulin leve ls an d in particu lar subnorma bclass leve ls are sometimes asymptomatic [25,26] . On t he ot her hand, unPAD patients can evo lve into a comp lete CVID p henotype over time [1]. T he clinica lly most important di fference between CVID and unPAD is that patients with CVID are more prone to develop severe autoimmunity, interstitial lun g disease, granulomatous in filtrations, to unPAD patients [2 3]. In chapter 2 we show in a relatively lar ge (symptomatic ) unPAD cohort that these patients present hetero genous manifestations encompassin g a wide ran ge of disease severity. While some patients suffered from unusual infections / unusuall y severe course of infections or even autoimmune or chronic inflammator y disease, others onl y suffered from recurrent 'normal' ENT and airwa y infections or chronic fati gue [27] . A strikin g 44% already showed bronchiectasis at presentation, and their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was si gnificantly decreased in all domains, meanin g that a lot of unPAD patients had to cope simultaneously with pain, ne gative feelin gs and impairments in co gnition, home mana tasks, sleep, social interaction, and work. Althou gh unPAD is generally considered clinically mild and not very relevant, these results show that patients with unPAD can suffer from serious conditions and impairment, and that it is important to pa y more attention to the potential disease burden o f unPADs. For example, when a repeatedly isolated decreased serum IgM is found, i.e. selective IgM deficiency (sIgMdef ), clinicians are also confronted with a dilemma. The clinical consequences of sIgMdef are not sufficiently known, and therefore clinicians struggle with 319General discuss ion 10what they should do with such a findin g. IgM de ficiency has been linked to a variety o f clinical mani festations, includin g severe or recurrent and mali gnanc y [28- 34]. However, these studies have been mainl y performed in tertiar y centres and are therefore biased towards disease. In chapter 3 we showed that decreased serum I gM levels can often incidentally be found in asymptomatic adults in a secondary centre population [35]. Determination of the clinical significance of sIgMdef is not only challenged by the rarity and highly variable phenotype, but - analogous to the dispute about the correct definition of CVID - also by the di fferent criteria for 'selective IgM de ficiency' that are used in the literature [29- 31,36-38 ]. In 2017, the IUIS de fined sIgMde f as an absent serum IgM level [39], and the ESID online Registry as serum IgM levels repeatedly below 2 standard deviations o f normal with normal levels of serum I gA and I gG and I gG subclasses, normal vaccine responses, absence of T lymphocyte defects, and absence of causative external factors (www.esid.org g). Man y previously published papers that report on 'I gM deficiency' also include I gM-deficient patients with decreased I gG-subclass (es), abnormal vaccine response and/or T lymphocyte defects under the term 'selective I gM deficiency'. We showed in chapter 3that in a quarter of the literature cases, the de ficiency is not 'selective', because other immunolo gical abnormalities were present. These patients with concomitant specific antibody deficiency (SPAD ) and/or IgG subclass de ficiencies may be at risk o f more severe and frequent in fections, comparable to the increased number o f lower respiratory tract in fections and bronchiectasis in patients with IgA deficiency in combination with IgG subclass deficiency and/or SPAD [15]. Patients with recurrent and /or severe infections and decreased serum I gM levels in combination with SPAD have been described to benefit from immuno globulin substitution [4,16]. Therefore, we prefer to cate gorise these I gM-deficient with concomitant other immunolo gical abnorma lities as unPAD. In or der t he question: \"How s hould we mana ge patients with repeatedly isolated decreased serum I gM levels?\", we performed a lar ge multicentre study with the aim to on ly includetruly sIgMdef patients (y chapter 4). Unfortunatel y, even this multi-centre stu dy cou ld not answer t he question. W hen a persistent ly decrease d serum IgM was found, it was rarely fully analysed (data on IgG subclasses and/or vaccination responses were lacking). If we want to truly answer the question how to manage patients with repeatedly isolated decreased serum IgM levels we should fully analyse and accurately describe these patients. In addition to our studies on isolated decreased serum I gM, we also studied the clinical relevance of isolated impaired anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS) I gG, I gM and IgA responses. The published clinical mani festations o f SPAD are mostly based on I gG polysaccharide antibod y deficienc y and comprise recurrent respirator y tract in fections with encapsulated bacteria, and less o ften autoimmune or rheumatic diseases, chronic diarrhoea, and bronc hiectasis [40 ]. The clinical relevance o f speci fic PnPS IgM or IgA de ficiency is as yet unknown. Theoretically, both speci fic PnPS IgM and speci fic PnPS IgA de ficiency could be clinically relevant, because both IgM and IgA antibodies are part of mucosal immunity 320Cha pter 1 0 and can prevent bacterial adhesion and thus colonisation o f the upper respiratory tract epithelium [41]. These antibodies could there fore act as e pithelial sur faces to clear bacteria and prevent colonisation and invasion. I gA is the predominant immuno globulin isotype in the mucosal immune system, which widely exists in the gastrointestinal tract, respirator y tract, vaginal tract, tears, saliva, and colostrum [42]. Thus, IgA is critical for mucosal immunit y and maintenance of the intestinal microbial homeostasis. Of the antibody-producing cells in mucosae, 6% (nasal glands) to 18% (duodenum/jejunum) [41]. It is there fore plausible that IgM antibodies may, at least in part, protect patients against bacteria known to colonise the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae [43]. In patients with hyper IgM syndrome a protective role o f IgM anti -H in fluenzae antibodies in both sera and saliva has been su ggested to reduce the risk of acute infections and chronic respirator y tract disease in these patients [44] . Indeed , in patients wit h [45,46] and PAD [47] decrease d anti-PnPS I gA an d IgM responses have been associated with a greater rate of respiratory infections. In chapter 9 we s how t hat a ll patients in our co hort wit h a decrease d anti-PnPS I gM or I gA response had already been classi fied as havin g a form o f PAD based on serotype-speci fic PnPS I leve ls [48]. There fore, we could not demonstrate the clinical relevance o f 'speci fic anti-pneumococcal IgM or IgA antibody de ficiency' based on our data. It is use ful to further investigate this issue in a larger cohort. We do not know why an a ffected individual develops a particular unPAD phenotype. Furthermore, the extensive disease hetero geneity complicates research in this area. While several classifications have been proposed to distin guish sub groups amon g CVID patients, mainl y based on peripheral B and /or T l ymphoc ytes [49- 53] and clinical phenot ypes [ has not yet been investi gated for unPAD patients. We made, for the first time, an attempt to subclassif y unPAD in chapter 2. Unfortunately, due to the limited sample size (99 adult patients ), this was not (yet) feasible. In our still ongoing 'unPAD study' (described in detail in chapter 6 ) we will focus on subclassifying unPAD, not only to predict disease outcomes, but also to inform which subgroups should be more strictly monitored or differently treated according to subtype. In addition, the potential identi fication o f more homogeneous subgroups can help to unravel the genetic background o f unPAD patients. This in formation will help to gui de clinicians to answer t he question: \"w hat s hould I do wit h this in dividual unPAD patient?\".321General discuss ion OF HYP OGAMMA GLOBULINAEMI C PATIENT S Two important functions o f antibodies in the immune response to in fection are the neutralisation of viruses and opsonisation of bacteria. Assays that are fully able to assess these functions are not available for routine clinical use. Instead, antibody function is estimated by measurin g an individual's response to specific vaccinations. The measurement of vaccine responses is indicated when upper/lower respiratory tract infections occur frequently,infections are unusual or severe , or when there is an unusual need for antibiotic treatment. According to the ESID protocol for diagnosing PID, serum IgA, IgG and IgM should first be determined to rule out severe antibod y deficienc y [11]. In case o f a decreased level o f at least one isotype or i f the results are normal but recurrent ENT and airway in fections persist for more t han 3-6 mont hs, vaccine responses are assesse d. Where t he protein vaccines - e. g. tetanus and diphtheria vaccines - require intact B and T l ymphoc yte function, pol ysaccharide vaccines - e.g., 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS ) vaccine - require functional B lymphocytes only. SPAD is characterized by deficient antibody production a gainst the capsular polysaccharides of encapsulated bacteria, such as Stre ptococcus pneumoniae. The diagnosis of SPAD is classically based on the measurement of serotype-specific I gG against PnP S vaccines [ 55]. The lack o f consensus and o f evidence re gardin g the dia gnostic criteria of SPAD is a challen ge in daily clinical practise [56]. Serotype-speci fic concentrations 1. 3 mcg /mL are indicative of normal ability to r espond to polysaccharide antigens, but lower levels (0.35 mcg/ml ) are considered adequate for protection against invasive pneumococcal disease [55,57 ]. Discussion exists about the amount o f serotypes that have to achieve these values; some experts believe that the normal response should be reduced to > 50% o f the tested serotypes rather than > 70% of the tested serotypes [58,59]. An additional problem is that man y health care providers do not have access to perform the serot ype-specific PnPS assa y [60-62 ]. Other tests have been proposed as complementar y to or as alternative for the PnPS response for the dia gnosis of SPAD, such as measurement of anti- Salmonella (S.) typhi Vi antibodies, and of the cumulative I gG response to all 2 3 serotypes present in the PnPS vaccine (2 3-valent I gG assay). Indeed, in chapter 8, we showed that the 2 3-valent I gG assay is a reliable screenin g test for identifyin g conju gated-vaccine-naive patients who respond normally to PnPS vaccination in a low pre-test probability settin g. This assay is therefore particularly useful in general hospitals. By filterin g out those patients with recurrent infections who probably do not have antibody deficiency - which is by far the lar gest group in such a settin g - fewer patients will have to be referred to specialised centres for serotype testin g. This hi ghlights the importance o f per formin g dia gnostic tests suited to the clinical setting. The IgG response to Typhim Vi vaccination, using the VaccZyme Salmonella typhi Vi IgG ELISA, has also been shown to be of additional use to accompany serotype-specific PnPS responses for the assessment of antibody deficiencies [63-66 ]. In contrast to PnPS anti bodies, 322Cha pter 1 0 the concentrations o f Typhim Vi antibodies are low in most healthy Western citizens [65]. The measurement o f an I gG response to the Typhim Vi vaccine is there fore especiall y useful for patients suspected of havin g an antibody deficiency who have a hi gh baseline concentration of pneumococcal antibodies or in patients who have previously received aconjugated pneumococcal vaccine or immunoglobulin substitution therapy. In chapter 9, we investigated whether addition of the anti-PnPS IgA and/or IgM assay could reduce the need for serotype-specific IgG testing [48]. However, adding these assays to the anti-PnPS IgG assa y could not reduce the need for the more expensive and di fficult to interpret serot ype- speci fic IgG testing in our general CS The aetiology o f hypogammaglobulinaemia is largely unknown. Many cases seem to be complex disorders in which multiple genes and/or environmental factors determinethe final phenotype [1]. Increasingly, but still only in a minority of patients with CVID (< 20% cohorts [67 ]) specific genetic defects have been identified (e.g. mutations in genes involved in signalling through the B-cell receptor (CD19, CD21, CD81 ), and those are, however, not only found in CVID patients; they have also been reported in patients with I gG subclass deficiencies [72,7 3] and I gA deficiency [74 ]. Alterations in TACI are no longer regarded as disease causing but as co factors a ffecting especially the T lymphocyte-independent antibody response and increasing the risk o f developing autoimmune and lymphoproliferative complications. Other localised genetic defects in CVID patients have been identified in genes such as lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor days, each de fective molecule is considered a separate form o f immunode ficiency and is considered a mono genic LRBA and NLRP12 and enrichment o f variants in known and novel disease pathways, con firming a polygenic nature o f CVID and individual-speci fic aetiologies [78]. In addition, recent studies demonstrated the role o f epigenetic modi fications in the develo pment o f disorders associated with CVID [79,80 ]. These epi genetic mechanisms can influence gene expression without alterin g the germline DNA gene sequences and play an important role in the normal developmental pro gram of immune cells [80]. The mec hanisms descri bed to date inc lude DNA met hylation, c hromatin mo dulation, histone modification, factor expression, and noncodin g RNAs [81]. Mu ltiple re ports support the notion of a complex basis of CVID and related milder PAD disorders, in which an accumulation of multiple genetic and/or environmental factors contributes to the final phenot ype [79,82,8 3]. Lon g-term follow-up of currently healthy family members who are carryin g known CVID-related genetic variants can help identify epi genetic or environmental factors that influence the clinical penetrance of these variants . Our studies su ggest that X-linked mechanisms may play a role in the development of some forms of primary hypo gamma globulinaemia. In both our cohort of unPAD patients (cha pter 2 ), our review of CVID patients (chapter 5)and previousl y published ESID online Registry reports [84-86 ], in children (74% in unPAD; 62% in CVID ). This could be the result of (unrecognised) X-linked disease in these patients. On the contrary, females predominated in adults (74% in unPAD; 58% in CVID ), suggesting that324Cha pter 1 0 these diseases are not the same in children and adults. Adult female predominance also suggests that sex hormone e ffects, environmental exposure and epi genetic in fluences might play a role [87 ]. These findin gs in any case implicate that future studies attemptin g to define disease mechanisms should be stratified accordin g to sex and a ge of disease onset.325General discuss ion 10FUTURE PER SPECTIVE S This thesis describes several aspects of patients with PAD, with a special focus on unPAD: the clinical picture, both at presentation and durin g follow-up, the current dia gnostic work - up practices, new screening methods enabling earlier detection, and the impact of unPADon patients' dail y lives. T o further improve earl y detection, future studies ma y include the development of pattern recognition algorithms, because it is impossible for non-experts toknow about all >8000 rare diseases; physicians are not likely to recognise a pattern they have(almost) never encountered. Thus, to minimise diagnostic delay, doctors need help. Since the1960s attempts have been made to develop computer-aided diagnosis support systems (DSSs) [88-91 ]. Examp les are DXp lain [92], GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiolog y Network ) [93 ], and Isabel [94 ], but their routine c linica l use remains limite d. In DXp lain a set of clinical findin gs (si gns, symptoms, laboratory data) can be entered to produce a ranked list of dia gnoses which mi ght explain the clinical manifestations [92]. GIDEON was deve loped for the fields of geographic and travel medicine and can generate a ranked differential diagnosis based on si gns, symptoms, laboratory results, country of ori gin and incubation period [93 ]. Isabel, named after the gravely ill daughter of the founder, consists of a diagnosis checklist system, an d includes more t han 11.000 diagnoses [94]. In a recent systematic review, differential diagnostic generators were reported to achieve high levels o f accurate diagnosis, but there was no evidence that they per formed better than clinicians [95]. They are o ften considered impractical in clinical practice due to the lar ge number o f suggested possible diagnoses. Weber et al. noted that bi g data can really support trans formations in health care when data sets can be linked at the individual person level [96]. T echnolo gy may now be ripe to enable the development of next- generation DSSs based on these key insi ghts. Future studies should also be directed towards better characterisation and classification of the disease and understanding of the mechanisms that cause primary antibody deficiency. UnPAD is a highly heterogeneous disease group an d will remain so un less we succee d to classi fy the group into clinically meaning ful subgroups. E fforts to strati fy patients into different subgroups according to genetic screening, B and T lymphocyte studies and clinical presentations have already been made for CVID patients. These have resulted in new ways to diagnose and treat CVID. However, these efforts have not yet been made for unPAD patients. Next to characterising unPAD, the unPAD study (chapter 6) has been designed to investigate this for unPAD patients. A large, multicentre ESID online Registry cohort will be collected; all data will be fully monitored to ensure data quality. Data will comprise the demographical, clinical and immunolo gical characteristics of these patients at dia gnosis and durin g follow-up. Due to the lar ge size of the cohort, it will become feasible to perform meanin gful sub group analyses based on the collected characteristics. These - by nature more homogeneous -subgroups may help to unravel the genetic background of unPAD patients in the future by opening new perspectives in the analysis of gene mutations and alterations that may help to 326Cha pter 1 0 identi fy patients at hi gh risk o f unPAD complications at dia gnosis and provide in formation about underlyin g disease mechanisms, thereby guidin g the best choice o f therapy. A good example for patients primarily dia gnosed with CVID is the discovery of gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations in the NF-kB pathwa y [97 ]. This pathway plays an important role in multiple biological processes, such as de velopment and architectural organization o f secondary lymphoid organs, B lymphocyte maturation and survival, B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses and antibody production, formation of germinal centres, and various roles in T l ymphoc yte responses [98]. Not onl y can unPAD classi fication facilitate research on disease causing mechanisms and the targeted search and identi fication o f genetic defects, it also has potential to guide follow-up schedules and tailor treatment strategies for identified sub groups of unPAD patients. This will ultimately shed li ght on more personalised intervention approaches. However, as alread y seen in patients with CVID, it is plausible that phenotypic hetero geneity within patients with the same genetic variant (s) will complicate the identification of genetic factors, because of variable severity of the defect or other unknown factors.327General discuss ion 10FINAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE THE SIS 1. Mild hypogammaglobulinaemia can cause serious morbidity and often leads to significant impairment of health-related quality of life 2. Truly selective IgM deficiency is probably very rar e 3A. As previously reco gnised, most patients with CVID present with recurrent respirator y infections, but our meta-anal ysis demonstrates that CVID patients also frequentl y present with severe bacterial infections (meningitis, septicaemia, and immune dysregulation disease, autoimmune cytopenia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia), identifyingpatient categories that may also require evaluation for CVID 3 B. Presentation o f CVID is characterised by a bimodal sex distribution with male predominance in children (62%) and female predominance in adults ( gy 4A. Patients dia gnosed with PAD demonstrate a specific pattern of complaint presentation; they tend to normalize their symptoms (e.g. fati gue and recurrent infections ) and to carry on with usual activities, which is different from patients with for example chronic fatigue syndrome, w ho ten d to use avoi dance strategies 4B. Multiple factors negatively a ffect the timely diagnosis o f PAD: misattribution o f the presenting symptoms, getting so use d to symptoms t hat they are consi dered to be 'normal', the feelin g of not bein g taken seriously, and no lon ger seekin g care because there you are 'just bein g treated for symptoms' instead o f bein g investi gated for their caus e 5A.In a low pre-test settin g, the 3-valent Pneumococcal I gG assay is a reliable screenin g test to identify probable good responders in vaccine na\u00efve patient s 5B.

When infections continuously recur, this can be a si gn o f underlying primary immunodeficiency (PID). Of all PIDS, hypogammaglobulinaemias form the lar gest group, but they are still very rare. Most health care professionals, who are not specialised in immunodeficienc y, do not consider potential PID in patients with common symptoms, such as recurrent \"normal\" in fections and chronic fatigue. These patients are there fore o ften diagnosed late, particularly those with milder phenotypes presenting at later stages. As a consequence, they suffer long uncertainty, multiple hospital attendances, investigations, mis diagnoses, an d inappropriate treatments, resu lting in huge emotiona l cost and wasted time, e ffort and resources. Reducing diagnostic delay is there fore important. In this thesis, clinical presentation patterns of sin gle- and multicentre patient cohorts with hypo gamma globulinaemia an d easier-to-interpret diagnostic tests are presente d and discussed in detail with the aim to improve earlier detection of hypo gamma globulinaemia. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the general principles o f immunity, underlyin g genetic defects and clinical presentation o f hypo gamma globulinaemia, with a special emphasis on unclassified primary antibody deficiencies (unPAD ), including the problem of diagnostic delay and explanation why we set up the unPAD study. Subsequently, an outline o f the content is given and the aims o f this thesis are described : 1. T o describe a secondary centre cohort with primary antibody deficiency (PAD ), in whom the majorit y has unPAD. 2. T o review a ll previous ly pu blished patients wit h decrease d serum IgM an d descri be a cohort of Dutch patients with persistent, isolated decreased serum I gM. 3. T o describe a lar ger multicentre European cohort of patients with I gM deficiency usin g data of the ESID Online Database. 4. T o review all existin g data on the clinical presentation and follow-up of common variable immune deficiency (CVID ). 5. T o present the desi gn and rationale for the unPAD study. 6. T o explore the journey to a PAD dia gnosis from the perspective o f patients and to analyse how these patients appraise their s ymptoms and which factors are involved in a decision to see k me dical care. 7. T o investigate the application o f the 23-valent anti-PnPS IgG assay for l hospita l popu lation setting. 8. T o investigate the clinical relevance o f 23-valent anti-PnPS IgM and IgA assays in addition to t he anti-PnPS IgG assay.340Adde ndum Chapter 2 gains insi ght into the clinical characteristics and health-related quality o f life (HRQoL) of patients with PAD, mainly unPAD. Data from 2 3 children and 99 adults with PAD, collected as part of a standardized, 1-da y Care Pathwa y for suspected primar y immunodeficiency, were analysed. This study shows that unPAD can result in a severe patientburden, implicating that \"mild\" hypogammaglobulinaemia can be a serious condition. A high proportion of unPAD patients suffered from bronchiectasis and their HRQoL was significantl y impaired in all domains compared to the reference population. This means that a lot o f unPAD patients had to cope simultaneously with pain, negative feelings and impairments in cognition, home management tasks, sleep, social interaction, and work. The most prominentl y impaired HRQoL domain was vitality, indicating these patients feel extremely tired and worn out. This study hi ghlights the need for the clinician to acknowled ge the existence of unPAD and be aware of its potential consequences, in order to timely and appropriately manage its effects and com plications. Inchapter 3 , we descri be all previous ly pu blished patients wit h decrease d serum I gM an d a cohort o f Dutch patients with persistent, isolated decreased serum I gM in a lar ge teachin g hospital in 's-Herto genbosch, the Netherlands. Selective I gM deficiency (sIgMdef ) is defined as a serum I gM level repeatedly below 2 standard deviations o f normal with normal levels o f serum I gA, IgG and I gG-subclasses, normal vaccination responses, absence o f T cell de fects and absence of causative external factors. Our main findin g was that true sI gMdef is probably very rare. Unfortunately, when a decreased serum IgM level is found, it is rarely analysed fully: data on IgG subclasses and /or vaccination responses were lacking in 74% literature cases and 93% o f cases from our cohort. Also, di fferent criteria for 'selective IgM de ficiency' are used in the literature; in a quarter of literature cases the deficienc y was not 'selective', other immunolo gical abnormalities were present. Only 2% of literature cases and 7% of cases from our cohort completely fulfilled the ESID criteria. These results illustrate the clinicalchallen ge of determinin g the relevance of a serum sample with decreased serum I gM. Cha pter 4shows the results o f the SIMcal study: a re gistry study usin g the ESID online database. Characteristics from 98 patients with decreased serum IgM collected in 12 countries are described. When isolated decreased serum I gM levels are repeatedly found in a patient, clinicians are confronted with a dilemma. T o date it is not clear what the clinical conse quences of such a findin g are, and whether and if so how such patients should be treated. Even this multi-centre study could not solve this dilemma. Only ten patients completely fulfilled the ESID criteria for true sI gMdef, and when usin g the ESID dia gnostic protocol reference values, only six patients had true sI gMdef (age-matched cut-off values varied widely between centres). Because of these small numbers, further analyses were performed in patients with true or possible sIgMdef (13 adults, 48 children ). Adults with more severely decreased serum IgM levels were more likely to be younger and to be symptomatic. This information can341Summar y Shelp in interpretin g the clinical si gnificance when an isolated decreased serum I gM level is discovered. I f we want to explore its clinical consequences, we should fully anal yse and accurately describe those patients in whom a decreased serum I gM level is found. Chapter 5 systematically reviews all existing data on the clinical presentation and follow- up of common variable immune deficiency (CVID). Our meta-analysis of 51 studies (n=8512 patients), identifying 134 presenting and 270 total clinical manifestations, confirmed the high frequency of respiratory infections at presentation (75%), but also showed a high incidence of severe bacterial infections such as sepsis (8%) and menin gitis idiopathic thrombocytopenia (6%). These findings can help clinicians to recognise CVID, and to estimate how common a clinical mani festation is in paediatric and adult CVID. The data showed clear di fferences in clinical mani festations occurring during the disease course between children and adults with CVID, with more non-in fectious disease com plications in adults. This implies that di fferent monitorin g strate gies are warranted for children and adults durin g follow-up. This study also revealed a bimodal sex distribution, with male predominance in children (62% ) and female predominance in adults (58%), which su ggests differences in genetic and environmental aetiolo gy in CVID between adults and children and has consequences for pathophysiolo gic studies. Chapter 6 presents the design and rationale for 'the unPAD study'. Unclassified antibod y by decreased total IgG, IgG-subclass (es), IgM, Ig A and /or specific antibodies, alone, or in combinations, but not fulfilling the criteria for CVID. They are considered milder forms o f hypogammaglobulinemia and are there fore o ften ignored in clinical practice and the literature. UnPADs o ften remain undiagnosed for years, but can ultimately lead to important morbidity, irreversible or gan dama ge, and loss of lifespan when they are not reco gnized and adequately treated. There fore, we desi gned the unPAD study to describe in detail all types o f PAD patients without a known speci fic mono genetic ori gin (thus excluding e.g. X-linked and autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia, and class-switchrecombination defects) re gardin g their clinical and immunolo gical pattern at presentation and durin g follow-up usin g the ESID online Re gistry. Because clinical severity as well as the results of immunolo gical laboratory investi gations and potential underlyin g pathophysiolo gy may differ greatly within this group, this study also aims to identify sub groups based upon these clinical and immunolo gical characteristics. All data will be monitored and - if necessary - corrected be fore statistical exploration o f the re gistered data will be per formed. This study is currently running, and 10 participating centres have already been monitored. Many centres are still registering their patient data into the ESID online Database and will be monitoredin the future.342Adde ndum Chapter 7 focusses on the journey to a PAD dia gnosis from the perspective o f patients. This qualitative study revealed presentin g patterns that can help identi fy those patients who are 'alwa ys ill' and 'worn out' with PAD and factors that are involved in a decision to seek medical care. Remarkably, PAD patients tended to normalise their symptoms and carry on with usualactivities. Medical presenting patterns included: 1) infections being unusually frequent and/or severe, not clearly season-bound, requiring antibiotics to clear, and 2) undergoing tympanoplasty, sinus surgery and/or polypectomy. F actors negatively affecting the speed and accuracy of diagnosing PAD included: 1) misattributing the presenting signs and symptoms to common, self-limiting illnesses, 2) lack of knowledge about the clinical presentation of PAD in general practitioners and non-immunologists, 3) reluctance to seek care because of getting so used to symptoms that patients therefore considered to be normal, feelin gs of not bein g taken seriously and a negative quality of the doctor-patient relationship. This study underlines the importance of education pro grammes, which should not only focus on the medical 'red fla gs' of PID, but also on copin g strate gies of more common, less differentiatin g symptoms such as 'bein g always ill' and 'worn out'. However, education pro grammes alone cannot be the final solution, because it is impossible for non-experts to know about all >8000 rare diseases. Hope fully, modern developments in automated pattern recognition can be developed to o ffer 'red flags' in the electronic patient file that alert a physician to potential underlying problems. This qualitative analysis can help the design o f predictive models in this regard. Cha pter 8reveals a new-developed decision tree, showing that the 23-valent Pneumococcal IgG assay can be a reliable screening test to predict good responders to PnPS-vaccination in conjugate d-vaccine-na\u00efve patients in a low pre-test pro bability setting, wit h the serotype - specific assay as a second-line test. All patients with a pre-immunization-titre 38.2 g/ ml and/or post-immunization-titre 96.1 g/ml and none with a post-immunization-titre 38.5g/ml exhibited a good response to PnPS vaccination. Only 24% of patients would require further serotypin g when these breakpoints as screenin g test to predict good responders are used. This analysis supports implementation of the 2 3-valent I gG assay to lower the threshold for timely detection o f PAD by reducing the overall number o f patient samples needing serotype speci fic antibody measurement, thus reducin g overall costs. Cha pter 9 reports the results of anti-PnPS I gM and I gA assays in addition to anti-PnPS IgG assays (240 patients; 304 samples) in patients with potential PAD in a general hospital population. This study revealed that patients classified as havin g an intact antibody response based on the measurement of serotype-specific PnPS I gG, still can display impaired anti - PnPS I gM and I gA responses. Because none o f the patients with a decreased anti-PnPS I gM or IgA response had been classified as PAD' based on serotype-specific PnPS IgG testingand t he clinical relevance o f 'speci fic IgA or IgM antibod y deficiency' could not be determined based on our data. Adding anti-PnPS IgA and IgM assays 343Summar y Sto the anti-PnPS I gG assay could not reduce the need for the more expensive and di fficult to interpret serotype speci fic PnPS I gG testin g. There fore, based on our data, it does not seem useful for a clinician in a general hospital to request anti-PnPS I gA and I gM assays in addition to the anti-PnPS I gG assay. Chapter 10 provides a general discussion, in which the main findings o f this thesis are discussed, followed by implications and directions for further research. Taken together, patients with 'milder' forms o f hypogammaglobulinaemia, i.e. unclassi fied primary antibody deficiencies (unPAD), are often dia gnosed late, i gnored in clinical practice and the literature, and incompletel y anal ysed nor accuratel y described. Also for these patients, earl y detection and ade quate treatment is im portant, because unPAD can be a serious condition; 44% o f patients in our co hort a lready showe d bronc hiectasis at presentation an d their health-related quality o f life was signi ficantly decreased in all domains. Our meta-analysis reveals that an exclusive focus on the currently existing in fection-centred warning signs would miss around 25% o f CVID patients that initially present with immune dysre gulation features. In addition to these medical aspects, non-medical aspects, such as copin g strate gies o f patients who are can help to distin guish hypo gamma globinaemia from chronic fatigue syndrome or innocent and sel f-limitin g infections. Our developed decision tree, usin g the 2 3-valent Pneumococcal I gG assay as a first-line test and the serotype-speci fic assay as a second-line test, can be used as a reliable screenin g tool for earlier detection of hypogammaglobinaemia. In order to confirm our r esults and further investigate clinical presentation patterns and complications o f unPAD patients, a larger patient cohort is necessary. This could also enable the identi fication o f potential subgroups, identi fying which patients are clinicall y more severe, and need strict follow-up and potential different treatment strate gies. F or t his reason, we deve lope d the unPAD stu dy, a mu lti-centre re gistry study based on t he ESID on line database, w hich is sti ll ongoing.
