Great strides in treatment and prevention have significantly reduced the impact of this disease in British Columbia (BC); however, control is far from complete. Over the past five years, approximately 300 people were diagnosed with TB annually, with an average incidence of 7.0 cases per 100,000 people. TB has also become increasingly concentrated among three populations over the past decades: foreignborn Canadians from tuberculosis endemic countries, Aboriginal peoples, and socially marginalized individuals. The BC Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Prevention, Treatment and Control is a framework through which we can improve the health of people in BC by guiding and supporting efforts to reduce TB incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality. The plan was developed through 36 intensive discussion sessions with a broad range of stakeholders representing numerous health care, social service and advocacy organizations. The vision of the plan is to greatly reduce TB incidence and transmission in BC. A roadmap for achieving this vision is contained in five strategic goals, which are supported by detailed objectives and strategies. These objectives and strategies are intended to guide decisionmakers and service providers in their day today operations. Achieving the five strategic goals will take considerable effort across the health system and will require comprehensive strategies that engage the public, decision makers, and service providers to ensure TB prevention and treatment remain a priority. This demands the collaborative effort of many groups in BC, including health authorities, physicians, allied health care workers, and community organizations. With the BC Ministry of Health providing executive stewardship, provincial public health services are provided by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA), First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (which, at the time of this writing, is in the process of being transferred to the First Nations Health Authority) and the five regional health authorities (Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, Interior Health, Northern Health, and Vancouver Island Health). Milestones will assess progress at various stages over the course of the plan. To ensure implementation and accountability, a committee comprised of the major stakeholders will be responsible for reaching the milestones, with particular attention on the priority actions, and will provide annual progress reports and updates to the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee. Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , a bacteria spread from person to person through air droplets. TB disease - also known as active TB - usually affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other organs, including the lymph nodes, brain, and spinal cord (extrapulmonary TB) amongst others. Left untreated, a person with infectious pulmonary TB can infect an average of 10 - 15 people every year.1 When appropriately managed, however, active TB is largely curable and usually preventable. At the turn of the twentieth century, TB was a leading cause of death and disability in British Columbia (BC). Fortunately, like many other highincome regions, BC has made tremendous progress in TB control over the past century, with the rates decreasing to among the lowest in the world (see Figure 1). Undoubtedly, improved socioeconomic conditions and antimicrobial therapy contributed to this decline, but credit also goes to the dedicated nurses, doctors and public health officials who built, adapted and sustained our robust provincial TB prevention and treatment program. Despite great strides in treatment and prevention, TB control efforts in BC are far from complete. With more than 8.8 million incident cases and 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2010, TB remains one of the world's deadliest diseases. Moreover, drugresistant strains are proliferating globally, threatening to destabilize current control efforts. For this reason, TB constitutes a global health emergency, and remains a constant threat to provincial TB control.2 020406080100120 1924 19271930 1933 1936 1939 1942 1945 1948 1951 1954 1957 1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 19781981 198419871990199319961999200220052008Rate per 100,000 population Figure 1: Tuberculosis incidence rates - Canada: 1924 - 2009 On a provincial level, considerable regional variation in approaches to TB control have developed over the past 40 years. As the legally responsible officials for TB control in BC, there has been keen interest among the Medical Health Officers to review the delivery of provincial TB prevention and treatment 5 1 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/ 2 WHO Report 2010: Global tuberculosis control. WHO Global tuberculosis control: a short update to the 2009 report. WHO/HTM/TB/2010.7. 6 services and to explore opportunities to build on the successful practices currently in place. The TB Strategic Plan will improve the health of people in BC by guiding and supporting health system efforts to reduce the incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality associated with TB. In the following pages, a shared vision serves as a blueprint for strategic leadership on reducing TB transmission in BC through five strategic goals: 1. Reduce incidence of active tuberculosis in British Columbia by 50 per cent by 2022. 2. Prevent transmission of tuberculosis within BC, in part by addressing social determinants of health such as housing, mental health and addictions treatment. 3. Prevent the development of active tuberculosis in those with latent tuberculosis infection, especially in new immigrants from high prevalence countries. 4. Ensure that the public health tuberculosis response is robust, timely and able to meet ongoing and outbreak needs. 5. Ensure stateoftheart laboratory programs, treatment, and care of people who develop tuberculosis to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of spread. Three milestones for achievement reflect the commitment to accountability and improving the health of British Columbia. 1. By 2022 British Columbia will reduce the incidence of active tuberculosis by 50 per cent. 2. By 2022 British Columbia will reduce the incidence of active tuberculosis in specific high risk and vulnerable groups by 50 per cent. 3. By 2017, all performance targets from the Guidance for Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Programs in Canada will be reached in: Microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis HIV serologic testing Treatment of tuberculosis Contact followup Targeted screening for active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection Immigration medical surveillance Achieving the five strategic goals will take considerable effort across the health system and will require comprehensive strategies that engage the public, decision makers, and service providers to ensure TB prevention and treatment remain a priority. This demands the collaborative effort of many organizations responsible for health and social services in BC, including health authorities, physicians, allied health care workers, and community organizations.7 TB Overview International Context The burden of TB is distributed unequally, with the vast majority of cases and deaths occurring in resourcepoor regions. While the highest incidence rates of TB occur in African countries, the majority of cases occur in Asia; close to half of all new global cases occur in just six Asian countries: China, India, Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.3 With adequate medical and public health resources, TB control programs can successfully treat most TB cases, while attenuating most community transmission. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended \"short course\" treatment protocol has been available for over 30 years and is one of the most costeffective of all public health interventions.4 However, poverty and inadequate public health infrastructure have restricted access to TB diagnostics and treatment. According to the WHO, more than two million incident cases are undiagnosed and untreated each year.5 Fortunately, there have been recent gains in global TB control; global incidence has decreased by 1.3% per year since 2002, while the absolute number of incident cases has been falling since 2006. Guided by the WHO StopTB Partnership, a Global Plan for TB control has been developed. The Global Plan calls for scaling up of interventions related to the treatment of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI), encourages addressing multidrug resistant TB (MDRTB) and TBHIV coinfection, and emphasizes the importance of advocacy, care provider engagement and fostering community participation in TB control efforts.6 In line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, the Global Plan has set a goal to reduce TB prevalence and the number of TB related deaths by 50 per cent in 2015 relative to 1990. The Global Plan also set the ambitious goal of eliminating TB by 2050, with elimination defined as less than one case per million people per year).7 National Context Nationally, the Stop TB Canada initiative is an active part of the global movement to accelerate social and political action to stop the spread of TB. In 2006, the Canadian Tuberculosis Committee reviewed its national goal in the context of targets set by the WHO STOPTB Partnership and recommended a target reduction of 50 per cent of TB rates by 2015 (3.6 cases per 100,000 people compared to the 1990 rate of 7.0 cases per 100,000 people).8 The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), through the Division of 3 WHO Report 2010: Global tuberculosis control.

Ottawa, Canada: Canadian Lung Association and Government of Canada, 2007. Tuberculosis Prevention and Control, has endorsed this goal. At the time of this writing, PHAC and the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada (FNIHB) are in the process of renewing their National Tuberculosis Elimination Strategies.9 Presently, TB rates in Canada are amongst the lowest in the world. The overall incidence in Canada has decreased from 120 cases per 100,000 people in 1950 to less than five cases per 100,000 people in 2009.10 In addition, surveillance and treatment programs appear to be functioning well; all known TB cases are reported to provincial TB control programs, there are low levels of drug resistance, and there is universal access to free TB medications. Provincial Context Over the last 50 years, TB rates in BC have decreased to very low levels. In the last 5 years, approximately 300 people were diagnosed annually with TB, with an average incidence rate of 7.0 cases per 100,000 people11. Individuals with TB are diagnosed throughout the province, including remote communities, although more than 70 per cent of cases occur in the Greater Vancouver Region. In the 1980s, TB rates were falling by an average of over 5 per cent annually; however, in the last 5 years, these rates have decreased by less than 2 per cent per year (Figure 3). With the decline in overall incidence, TB has become increasingly concentrated among three populations in BC: foreignborn Canadians from TB endemic countries, Aboriginal peoples, and socially marginalized individuals. 9 Health Canada.

This likely reflects several phenomena, including the decrease in TB incidence in Canadian born populations, the increase in proportion of foreignborn populations in Canada, and an increasing proportion of immigrants from high incidence countries (defined as a TB incidence rate exceeding 15 cases per 100,000). In 2009, foreignborn populations accounted for 63 per cent of all reported TB cases in Canada and 66 per cent of reported cases in BC. 12 TB in Aboriginal Peoples Despite increased efforts, the rate of TB in Aboriginal peoples remains consistently higher than the rate in foreignborn and Canadian born nonAboriginal people (Figure 4). The TB rate in Aboriginal peoples is six times higher than the national average, which is in part related to social, economic and environmental factors affecting Aboriginal communities.13 The rates of TB in Aboriginal peoples have been very slow to decline over the last 20 years. Indeed, in 2008, the rate of TB in BC Aboriginal peoples reached the highest level in over 5 years at 28.2 cases per 100,000 people.14 12 Public Health Agency of Canada, Tuberculosis in Canada 2009 - Prerelease, http://www.phac aspc.gc.ca/tbpc latb/pubs/tbcan09pre/index eng.php#t3 , Elimination Strategy July 2011, p.10. 13 Public Health Agency of Canada, Tuberculosis in First Nations Communities, 1999. http://www.hc sc.gc.ca/fniah spnia/pubs/diseases maladies/_tuberculos/1999_commun/index eng.php#a5 .

TB in marginalized individuals and other groups at high risk Those who are marginalized in society, for reasons that may include mental illness, problematic substance use, poverty, and homelessness, are at an increased risk of TB exposure and disease. Exacerbating risk in this population is the inability of health care services to engage and meet the needs of marginalized people. 16 Other high risk groups include recent contacts of infectious TB cases, and those with immunosuppressive comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, HIV infection, therapeutic immunosuppression and structural lung disease. High risk groups account for over 30 per cent of TB cases in BC annually, with HIV coinfection present in six percent of all active TB cases17. Table 1 describes the relative risk of developing TB for various cohorts.18 15 Medical Services Branch Working Group on Tuberculosis. National tuberculosis elimination strategy.

The First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada also funds TBrelated services as well as onreserve public health, home care, environmental health, and problematic substance use services. Individuals and families Individuals and families play an important role in helping to stop TB. Ongoing reductions in TB depend in part on individuals and families having the knowledge, skills and ability to manage their health. Ongoing effective, responsive TB policies and programs depend on individuals and families having opportunities to provide input into them. Communities While not directly involved in providing TB services, local governments, community agencies, and business and employer organizations can play an important role in helping the health care system manage TB. Actions can range from local governments developing policies around crowded conditions in congregate settings to community agencies conducting TB education and screening activities. First Nations Health Authority On October 13, 2011, the federal and provincial ministers of health, along with the BC First Nations Health Council and BC First Nations Health Society signed the British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance that will ensure BC First Nations have a major role in the planning and management of health services for First Nations through a new First Nations health governance structure. The new governance structure includes the First Nations Health Authority, Tripartite Committee, First Nations Health Directors Association, and First Nations Health Council. These groups will be responsible for the leadership, coordination, planning, management, funding and service delivery of health programs for BC First Nations. Frontline Health Care Providers Primary care providers Primary care providers, such as family physicians and nurse practitioners, support British Columbians to stay healthy, recover from illness, live with disease and cope with end of life. In general, a high capacity to access and understand health data is an extremely important skill for primary care providers to possess. This allows for the translation of health information into practical treatment plans for their patients. With regards to TB, primary care providers perform screening, arrange for followup diagnostic tests to confirm an infection, and support ongoing care and treatment. They can assess the impact of TB therapeutic intervention from a holistic perspective (e.g., consider how TB treatment may affect co morbid conditions), and help to coordinate specialist care when it must be sought elsewhere. Please refer to Table 2 for more information on TB treatment responsibilities. 13 Respiratory and Infectious Disease specialists Respiratory and infectious disease specialists have extensive training in TB diagnosis and treatment. They order and interpret diagnostic tests, and can initiate and refine appropriate therapies to treat TB and LTBI. They address complicated diagnostic and treatment issues, such as drug resistance or medication interactions. They work in close collaboration with primary care providers and public health practitioners (e.g., public health nurses and medical health officers) to ensure the best care for the individual and the safety of the public. Table 2: People Responsible for Various Types of TB Treatment Treatment Function Person or Group Responsible Primary Care Physicians (local or at TB Prevention and Control), Nurse Practitioners, Nurses (public health or community health nurses), Directlyobserved Therapy (DOT) Workers Secondary Care Physicians (local or at TB Prevention and Control), Local Hospitals Tertiary Care Dedicated Ward at Vancouver General Hospital for TB patients managed by onsite respirologists. Patient Followup Physicians (local or at TB Prevention and Control), Nurse Practitioners, Nurses (public health or community health nurses), Directlyobserved Therapy Workers Enforcement for NonAdherent Patients (if necessary) Regional Health Authority Medical Health Officers Regional Health Authorities/ Treatment and Care Regional Health Authorities, Medical Health Officers and Public Health Nurses BC's regional health authorities play a central role in TB program delivery. In collaboration with BCCDC TB Prevention and Control (see below), regional health authorities are actively involved in surveillance, contact investigation, and supervision of treatment of both TB disease and LTBI within their health regions under the direction of MHO's. Historically, the involvement in TB management and contact investigation varies by regional health authority and individual circumstances. Currently, the BCCDCTB Prevention and Control clinics in Vancouver and New Westminster support direct public health services for the Vancouver Coastal health authority and some parts of Fraser Health. The remainder of Fraser, Interior and Northern health authorities, as well as Vancouver Island (except for Victoria), are supported through outreach from BCCDC FieldOperations (see below). In addition, regional health authorities address patient and worker infection and prevention control. 14 Medical Health Officers Medical health officers are physicians who have specialty training in Public Health and Preventative Medicine. They use population health knowledge and skills to play leading and collaborative roles in the maintenance and improvement of the health and wellbeing of their communities. They are responsible, in collaboration with the public health team, for monitoring, preventing and controlling communicable and chronic diseases, investigating disease outbreaks and hazards to health, and coordinating public health responses to health threats. Medical health officers carry out legislated requirements of a number of public health statutes which pertain to communicable disease prevention and control, environmental health, tobacco harm prevention, drinking water protection and community care facility licensing. They are responsible for the prevention and control of TB in their region by maintaining awareness among clinicians of tuberculosis trends in the community, carrying out public health follow up of TB, responding to clusters and outbreaks of TB, and guiding front line public health practice and research. Public Health Nurses and Community Health Nurses Public health nurses promote and protect the health of populations in diverse settings, such as community health centres, schools, street clinics, youth centres and nursing outposts, to meet the health needs of the whole or specific populations. They work with many partners in communities to implement maternal and child health promotion programs; disease and injury prevention programs; school health programs; sexually transmitted infection prevention programs that include treatment, education and outreach; immunization clinics; and communicable disease surveillance and control. They will often work closely with primary care providers, specialists, medical health officers and other regional health authority staff to ensure a coordinated response to TB case reports and outbreaks. Community Health Nurses provide the same functions as Public Health Nurses, with added responsibility for more general community development. Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) The PHSA is responsible for managing provincial agencies including the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), the BC Cancer Agency, and other organizations that provide provincewide specialized health care services. Provincial Public Health Microbiology & Reference Laboratory (PHMRL) The Provincial Public Health Microbiology & Reference Laboratory (PHMRL) is the primary public health and reference diagnostic testing facility for British Columbia. The laboratory is also nationally recognized for its public health leadership, regularly conducting nationally funded scientific evaluation, and playing a leadership role in many areas including drinking water, molecular microbiology, influenza and health care acquired infections. It works closely with acute care laboratories in its BC Public Health Laboratory Network and its national counterparts across Canada in the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network. BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), an agency of the PHSA, provides health systems leadership and supports regional health authorities to monitor, prevent and control communicable disease and promote environmental health in BC. It provides surveillance and response, applied scientific evaluation, 15 disease prevention and control, and infrastructure and training. The BCCDC is responsible for TB prevention and management through TB Prevention and Control (BCCDCTBC) as described below. TB Prevention and Control (BCCDC\u00adTBC) Organized in 1935 to provide TB services to people of BC, TB Prevention and Control (BCCDCTBC) underwent a shift in mandate in 1944 from a sanatoriumbased care model to providing services primarily in an outpatient setting (prior to 1944, there were no medications available to treat TB). BCCDCTBC now lies within the Clinical Preventative Services Division of the BCCDC, and is the provincial centre of excellence for TB. BCCDCTBC provides central coordination for TB surveillance, control and prevention efforts including familycentred care at its TB Control Clinics. BCCDCTBC works with regional health authorities to establish and maintain policies, standards and procedures for the control of TB in BC. This includes the provision of free medications for treatment of active disease and latent infection, administration of the centralized provincial TB registry database, Integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), and reporting of cases nationally. BCCDCTBC provides staffing for two clinics: Vancouver TB clinic in Vancouver Coastal Health Region and New Westminster TB clinic in Fraser Health Region. BCCDC\u00adTBC Field\u00adOperations The nurse led fieldoperations program works in collaboration with BCCDCTBC physicians. The program provides remote technical support, clinical consultation and coordination of contact investigations throughout the province. Direct patient care is provided by local physicians. Active cases are typically assigned to a regional public health nurse who works with the physicians, BCCDC and the client to facilitate care. Depending on the available resources of the local public health unit, patients may receive outreach DOT support. TB Services for Aboriginal Communities (TBSAC) The TB Services for Aboriginal Communities (TBSAC) program at the BCCDCTBC, funded by the BC Region of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada, provides consultative services to physicians and nurses providing health care to First Nations individuals living on reserve. Services include technical support, physician & nursing clinical consultation, planning, coordinating screening efforts, education, surveillance, and scientific evaluation. BC Ministry of Health and other Provincial Ministries As stewards of the provincial health system, the Ministry of Health provides leadership and support to health system partners, including health authorities, physicians, and other care providers. The Ministry sets the overall strategic direction for the health system, provides the appropriate legislative and regulatory frameworks to allow it to function smoothly, and plans for the future supply and use of health professionals, technology, and facilities. The Ministry, particularly through the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, also monitors and reports on the health of the population and plans for and coordinates responses to major public health risks and emergencies. The Ministry works to ensure a consistent level of service quality across the regions with no significant service gaps. It also evaluates health system performance, and takes corrective action where necessary to ensure the population's health needs are being met. 16 In addition to the Ministry of Health, other provincial ministries have an important role to play in the prevention and treatment of TB. For example, the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, through BC Corrections, is responsible for managing TB in provincial correctional institutions. Broader efforts across government and society address the systemic issues of poverty, literacy, and food security that effect where people live, work, and play. Federal Government At the national level, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with the provinces and territories to promote and protect the health of Canadians. A significant part of its mandate is to decrease the transmission of infectious diseases and to improve the health status of those infected. PHAC is responsible for the overall management of tuberculosis Prevention and Control in Canada. This national prevention and control programme includes central coordination, monitoring and evaluation, with each province and territory being responsible for developing and implementing control plans that are consistent with Canadian guidelines and protocols. Through the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, surveillance and epidemiology, risk management, scientific evaluation including laboratory science, health promotion, public health policy development and prevention and care programs are delivered. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) is responsible for assessing the health status of refugees and immigrants prior to their arrival in Canada. The PostLanding Immigration Surveillance (PLIS) program is federally mandated to require people with evidence of LTBI on a chest xray to present to public regional health authorities for evaluation following arrival in Canada. Correctional Services Canada (CSC), pursuant to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (Section 86, Inmate Health), must provide every inmate with essential health care that conforms to professionally accepted standards. In 1997, in collaboration with Health Canada's Division of Tuberculosis Prevention and Control and Occupational Health and Safety Agency (now Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme), CSC developed an infrastructure for surveillance of TB in Canadian federal correctional institutions.

Discussion sessions were conducted with the five regional health authorities, the Provincial Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory, BC Centre for Disease Control, immigrant serving organizations, agencies that support persons with HIV/AIDS, Aboriginal, First Nations and M\u00e9tis organizations, health care professionals, organizations that support workplace health and safety, federal and provincial correctional services, and a patient advocacy organization. This Strategic Plan reflects the input from the discussion sessions as well as a review of the BC Centre for Disease Control Provincial TB Elimination Strategy, the FNIHB TB Program Performance Indicators and Targets (draft), and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals regarding TB. Major themes derived from this input are presented in the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges analysis below (Table 3). As discussions across the province were carried out to inform this plan, a number of recurring and longstanding issues became apparent. Such issues included inconsistent responses to TB outbreaks; screening programs that differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; patient followup and contact investigation procedures that differed with procedures in other areas, even within the same health authority; uncertainty of roles for service provision to First Nations communities; and uncertainty of responsibility for clinical and public health service provision between TB Control and the regional health authorities. Overall, these issues reflect the effects of a series of major health system reorganizations on the tuberculosis program. These and other issues will be addressed through the goals, objectives, and actions of this strategic plan. A list of organizations that participated in the TB Discussion Sessions is provided in Appendix A. 19 Table 3: Analysis of Tuberculosis Service Delivery in British Columbia Strengths Weaknesses 1. Centralized expert TB services that provide provincial surveillance, medication management, patient and provider education, reference laboratory, and field consultative support. 2. Well established partnerships with other public health laboratory services and FNIHB. 3. Robust public health legislative framework. 4. Connected and coordinated communicable disease expertise through the regional health authorities. 5. Nongovernment partners who are willing to support and assist with provision of TB services. 1. Regional differences in public health response across BC create variation in prevention, testing, and care, which can contribute to inconsistency in outbreak response and general service provision. 2. Lack of coordinated effort for high quality TB surveillance. 3. Delayed reporting of centralized surveillance data to regional health authorities. 4. Uncertainty about allocation of screening resources, including possible misallocation to lowrisk groups. 5. Inconsistent engagement of new Canadians from high prevalence countries for LTBI therapy Opportunities Challenges 1. Increase spread and depth of education and TB literacy activities (e.g. through social marketing). 2. Develop consistent approach to outbreak management. 3. Redirect screening resources towards people at high risk of TB. 4. Apply new laboratory technologies such as IGRA, genomics, and PCRbased drug resistance testing. 5. Articulate and align roles and responsibilities of BCCDC and each RHA, and within RHAs. 6. Improve engagement with First Nations in the context of the Tripartite Agreement. 7. Linkages with other governmental and non governmental social service agencies to address health inequities. 8. Improve linkages with Citizenship and Immigration Canada to strengthen surveillance, extend reach, and enhance engagement of new Canadians. 9. Improve linkages with correctional health services to improve continuity of care for admitted and released inmates. 10. Enhance surveillance and reporting activities. 11. Develop consistent infection control and occupational health process in health care settings. 12. Develop a coordinated and collaborative scientific evaluation and evaluation plan. 13. Engage new partners in TB service delivery (e.g. Directly Observed Therapy, health promotion, advocacy). 14. Integrate TB services into relevant chronic disease services. 1. Rising prevalence of people with chronic disease that predispose to TB reactivation (e.g. diabetes, cancer, renal disease, HIV). 2. Endemic spread of drug resistant TB (MDRTB) elsewhere in the world. 3. Increasing immigration from countries with high rates of TB and drug resistant TB. 4. Financial constraints. 20 Strategic Plan A roadmap for reducing the incidence and impact of TB in BC is contained in five strategic goals, which are supported by detailed objectives and strategies. Their implementation is, in turn, guided by seven principles and values that are the foundation on which this Strategic Plan is built, and are intended to guide decisionmakers and service providers in their daytoday operations. Principles and Values Collaboration TB service providers must collaborate in order to ensure seamless, lowbarrier service delivery. Collaboration supports information sharing, communication and relationship building. Collaboration with and among community partners is essential to meet the needs of people with specific vulnerabilities. All TB service providers must have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities in achieving TB service delivery goals. Patient\u00adcentered holistic care TB service delivery must be patientcentred through ensuring multiple points of access, removing barriers and delivering services in a culturally competent manner. Patients can also assist in generating knowledge with respect to TB, and promoting awareness by teaching the general public. All partners will continue to not only improve access, but meaningfully engage patients into a health care system that supports and promotes a holistic vision of health. Embracing innovation To expand the reach of its programs and optimize TB service delivery, BC must be creative and innovative. This can occur through the use of new technology or implementing new strategies for reaching people with specific vulnerabilities. Best evidence Both the general public and health care professionals must be confident that the management of TB is based on the best available data and subjected to rigorous standards of analysis. A strong TB delivery services system must be supported by policies and procedures based in evidence and best practices. Building capacity Building capacity means developing, fostering, and supporting both the resources and the relationships required for TB service delivery at individual, organizational, interorganizational, and systems levels. It also includes reporting on the collaborative processes developed, and sharing lessons learned. Accountability, efficiency, and cost\u00adeffectiveness TB services must be delivered efficiently and make the best use of limited resources by seeking all opportunities to achieve the best value. Services should also support community action initiatives. Ethical, fair, and equal access and engagement Directly addressing poverty, access and health care engagement, overcrowding and inadequate housing combined with supporting health literacy and an improved system of care for TB will result in further reductions in the TB burden. 21 Healthy public policy Advocating for the health of patients and developing policy to increase health literacy among the general public as well as health care professionals will create a supportive environment where optimal TBrelated outcomes can be achieved. 22 Plan at a Glance\u2014Vision, Mission and Goals VISION Tuberculosis incidence and transmission in BC will be greatly reduced. MISSION Improve health in British Columbia by continuing to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis and its effects on individuals, families and communities through collaboratively delivered TB services, based on the best evidence and in a culturally competent manner. Goal 1 Reduce incidence of active tuberculosis in BC by 50 per cent by 2022. Goal 2 Prevent transmission of tuberculosis within BC, in part by addressing social determinants of health such as housing, mental health and addictions treatment. Goal 3 Prevent the development of active tuberculosis in those with latent infection, especially in new immigrants from high prevalence countries. Goal 4 Ensure that the public health tuberculosis response is robust, timely and able to meet ongoing and outbreak needs. Goal 5 Ensure stateoftheart laboratory programs, treatment, and care of people who develop tuberculosis to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of spread. 23 Priority Actions The following priority actions link to the plan's goals and objectives (pages 25 - 31) and outline the areas where immediate attention is needed. They reflect two important aspects of moving forward: responding to immediate, pressing needs, and taking steps that will lay a solid foundation for future activities. They are not intended to be ranked, rather they are to be acted upon concurrently; action on some are already underway, with the remainder to be initiated by February 2013.

(Goal 5, Objective 3.4) Allocate resources to improve management of TB in high risk populations (Goal 5, Objective 3.6) Ensure that hospitals, correctional facilities, and public health work together to put community followup plans in place prior to individuals being discharged or released. (Goal 5, Objective 4.1) 25 Milestones Milestones will help to mark progress at various stages over the course of the next 10 years. These milestones will serve as indicators of success and will be a component of the accountability framework to ensure that the objectives and actions set out below are achieving the goals set out in the plan. 1. By 2022 British Columbia will reduce the incidence of active tuberculosis by 50 per cent.19 From 2005 2008, the overall incidence rate of TB in the province was 7.1 per 100,000 people. 20 2. By 2022 British Columbia will reduce the incidence of active tuberculosis in specific high risk and vulnerable groups by 50 per cent: Foreign born people from TBendemic countries People with HIV infection Aboriginal peoples Homeless and underhoused populations From 2005 2008, the incidence rate of TB in Aboriginal peoples was 32.2 per 100,000 people; the rate in foreignborn individuals was 19.2 per 100,000 people; the estimated rate of TB in HIV positive populations is 138 per 100,000 people. The achievement of this milestone will limit secondary spread from these groups and consequently decrease the overall incidence of TB in British Columbia. 3. By 2017, all performance targets from the Canadian TB Strategy will be reached in: Microbiological diagnosis of TB HIV serologic testing Treatment of TB Contact followup Targeted screening for active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection Immigration medical surveillance 19 In 2006 the Canadian TB Committee reviewed the national goal in the context of targets set by the STOP TB Partnership and recommended targeting a reduction in TB incidence 50 per cent by 2015 compared to 1990 levels (targeting 3.6/100,000 by 2015). The Public Health Agency of Canada has endorsed these goals. This was a 9year goal. The BC Strategic Plan allows 10 years to reach this goal. 20 BC Centre for Disease Control.

A mechanism to ensure accountability for everything described in this strategic plan, especially the specific actions, will be established to guarantee meaningful action is taken. This mechanism will take the form of a committee comprised of the major stakeholders that will be responsible for reaching the milestones, with particular attention on the priority actions. The committee will provide annual progress reports and updates to the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee, construct a work plan, and develop an evaluation protocol among key partners, designed to complement existing monitoring activities and answer key questions. For instance, over time, are more atrisk people engaged in seeking and receiving treatment for TB? Has TB literacy improved? Has the capacity of the service delivery system been improved? This plan has been developed to serve as a guide. Formal public progress reporting will be completed each year, beginning in 2013. Information gathered through program evaluation and surveillance will be provided as part of a continuous feedback loop to assist policy makers, managers, and service providers to make sound program decisions, and ensure public accountability. Information will also be distributed more broadly to encourage changes in attitudes and behaviours at the individual, family, and community level. Over the longterm, progress reports will track advancement on attaining the plan's outcomes by answering the following questions: Have the plan's goals and milestones been attained? Are there improvements in program and policy to reach these milestones? Specifically, are there improvements in program and policies that address high risk populations? Are we on track to greatly reduce the transmission of TB in BC? 27 Goals, Objectives and Actions Strategic Goal 1 \u00ad Reduce incidence of tuberculosis in BC by 50 per cent by 2022.

(Lead agencies: Regional Health Authorities) 34 Glossary Aboriginal: Aboriginals are considered all Indigenous people of Canada, including Status and NonStatus Indian, M\u00e9tis and Inuit people. Indigenous has been interchanged with Aboriginal, Native, Native Peoples and First Peoples, and is generally used internationally. The term Aboriginal should always be capitalized. Active TB: Refers to TB infection in any part of the body that has become symptomatic, but does not imply whether there is any risk of transmission. This is also known as TB disease. Cluster: an unexpected grouping in time, place or population of disease; also refers to an outbreak in a defined group. Control: in context of when an outbreak is under control, control means returning to the baseline incidence (normal) for that population. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT): Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is the process whereby the ingestion of every dose of medication is directly observed in order to improve a patient's ability to adhere to a complex or challenging medication regimen. First Nation(s): The term First Nations came into common usage in the 1970s to replace band or Indian, which some people found offensive. Despite its widespread use, there is no legal definition for this term in Canada. The term First Nation should always be capitalized. First Nations People Many people prefer to be called First Nations or First Nations People instead of Indians. The term is not a synonym for Aboriginal Peoples because it doesn't include Inuit or M\u00e9tis. The term First Nations People generally applies to both Status and NonStatus Indians. First Nation Many bands started to replace the word band in their name with First Nation in the 1980s. It is a matter of preference by individual First Nations/bands. Health Promotion: the process of enabling people to increase control over, and improvement of their health. Incidence rate: the rate of new events occurring in a population of a given size. The numerator is the number of new events that occur in a defined period, the denominator is the population at risk of experiencing the event during this period. Infection Control : the discipline concerned with preventing infection in health care settings. Infectious TB: An active TB infection that is transmissible to others. Latent TB: TB infection that persists in a host without evidence of clinically active disease or transmission risk. Outbreak : a higher incidence of a disease than normally expected in specified timeframe, place and or population. Prevalence : the number of people with disease in a given population at a specified time. Primary Prevention : actions aimed at reducing the incidence of disease in a population Public health surveillance: ongoing and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of healthrelated data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. [WHO] Pulmonary TB: a TB infection of the lungs and conducting airways; the only site of infection that is commonly infectious and transmissible to others. 35 Screening : the identification of unrecognized disease risk in apparently well persons by the application of tests and or examinations. Sensitivity : is the proportion of truly diseased persons in a screened population who are identified as diseased by the screening test, true positive rate. Specificity : is the proportion of truly nondiseased persons who are identified by the screening test; true negative rate. Surveillance : ongoing observations to detect changes in trend or distribution of a health/disease/death issue in order to initiate investigation and or control measures. TB Disease: see Active TB.36 CONSULTATION SESSIONS APPENDIX B: HIGH LEVEL OUTLINE OF AN OUTBREAK IDENTIFICATION , MANAGEMENT AND REVIEW PROTOCOL APPENDIX C: AREAS OF SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION IDENTIFIED DURING THE TB CONSULTATION SESSIONS APPENDIX D: LIST OF TB STRATEGIC PLAN BACKGROUND PAPERS 37 Appendix A: List of TB Consultation Sessions During the spring of 2011, 34 TB discussion sessions were held with health authority frontline and management staff, and representatives from governmental and nongovernmental organizations including the Aboriginal community, Health Canada, immigrant serving organizations, organizations engaged with HIV/AIDS and federal and provincial corrections. In total over 100 individuals participated in the discussion sessions. Discussion session participants provided the project team with numerous ideas and suggestions. Feedback was recorded and common themes were incorporated into the strategic plan and stakeholders had an opportunity to review the draft strategy. The project team wishes to extend its sincere appreciation to all those who participated in the discussions and shared their commitment, energy, and enthusiasm.

Definitions that explain the difference between an emergency, a cluster, and an outbreak, what it means to 'control' an outbreak. The triggers/red flags for when to initiate a phone call or meeting because of a possible outbreak. Whose responsibility it is to declare an outbreak. The triggers for when to start outbreak control. Key processes/steps in an outbreak, e.g. o The regional health authority staff and the BC PHMRL to CDC for a briefing and planning session. o Identify any new partners specific to the outbreak, e.g. employers of migrant workers if outbreak concentrated in that population; immigrant serving societies if outbreak concentrated in a particular group. Clearly defined and documented roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders (use BC Emergency Response Management System as a possible model). Expected costs/areas of cost o How funding will be handled when costs are beyond the base budget. Resources/capacity o How to assemble and outbreak team [Nuuchah nulth Tribal Council has an example ] o How to ensure clinical, public health, and laboratory surge capacity o Key aspects of flexible resourcing for outbreaks. Challenges in an outbreak, e.g. o Finding possible contacts for testing purposes - the use of network analysis to find the 'nodes' where people go where there is not TB presence, i.e. soup kitchens Outbreak control for cluster outbreaks o Note: Cluster implies the same organism (genotyping; molecular genotyping) and showing recent transmission. This shows importance of early contact tracing. o Define and support the role of the BCPHMRL and its networks in the epidemiological aspect of detecting and characterizing TB. o Define the need to provide molecular characterization of all TB strains. o Define how BCPHMRL can use GIS to communicate laboratory molecular epidemiology data. o Epidemiological support for mapping transmission. Communication channels including: o Clarifying who interacts with the media 39 o Communication between the Lab and others o Communication with partners, e.g. emergency room doctors Data sharing o Developing a database for the purposes of the outbreak; use outbreak software if available o What data is shared, when, and by/to, whom Statement of criteria for determining that an outbreak is over, e.g. returning to the background level is not necessarily a good criteria Clear process for gathering 'lessons learned' at the end of the outbreak, including: o Meetings to debrief including a discussion as to why the smear positive cases were missed. o Written documentation of the outbreak, issues, and lessons learned o Process to modify the template for next time Final outbreak documentation o All outbreaks should be written up and shared Appendix C: Areas of scientific evaluation identified during th e TB Consultation Sessions 40 The following ideas were identified during the TB Discussion Sessions as possible areas for scientific evaluation: scientific evaluation on the value of conducting baseline screening for entire groups of workers what lessons can we learn from the First Nations communities whose incidence of TB is now much closer to the incidence for nonFirst Nations people focused study on which people reactivate in the first five years after emigrating to Canada to identify risk factors and help support targeted screening qualitative scientific evaluation on how to improve adherence to the TB treatment review scientific research on populations at high risk for noncompliance in order to ensure that the treatment approach is based on the best evidence scientific evaluation to develop a costeffective TB test with high levels of specificity and sensitivity support ongoing work around rapid quantitative molecular tests for TB that have the potential to replace traditional acid fast smears scientific evaluation into modelling the utility of implementing decentralized rapid molecular testing (Cepheid Gene Xpert) for TB across BC (in progress) scientific evaluation into molecular tests for detection of MDRTB and other drug resistant forms of TB evaluate the usefulness of universal genotyping of all TB isolates and sharing of data with other provincial and national partners applying genomics based methods for tracking TB transmission within outbreaks support analysis of new tools for surveillance participating in multi centre scientific research, nationally and internationally, to address the question of the role of IGRA testing in paediatric TB ethical issues associated with TB treatment what type of health promotion is most effective scientific evaluation on effective methods to reduce stigma undertake epidemiological and laboratory scientific research on TB in each regional health authority in partnership with necessary partners (Provincial Public Health Laboratory, community workers, etc) to inform program delivery evaluate whether the current TB Control program is having an effect among overall prevalence rates in immigrants evaluate the effectiveness of integrated service delivery including the provincial laboratory network review how outreach is currently done to determine if it is effective review the Public Health capacity to address these public health issues in rural and remote communities Enhance the capacity of the Provincial Public Health Microbiology & Reference Laboratory to undertake scientific evaluations Appendix D: List of TB Strategic Plan Background Papers 41 The following background papers are available upon request from the BCCDC: Background paper #1 - Overview of current TB situation: Globally, in Canada, and in BC Background paper #2 - Organization of TB Service Delivery in BC: Partnerships and Integrated Responsibilities Background paper #3 - Active Case Management: Prompt Diagnosis and Effective Treatment Background paper #4 - Surveillance; Outbreak Detection and Management; Infection Control; and Contact Tracing Background paper #5 - Targeted Testing and Treating of LTBI Background paper #6 - Enhanced Strategies for Vulnerable Demographic Groups Background paper #7 - Contributing to Global TB Control Efforts Background Paper #8 - Role of the British Columbia Public Health Laboratory and Its Networks for the Diagnosis, Management, Prevention and Control "}
