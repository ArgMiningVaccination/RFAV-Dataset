Now what?Quite possibly,you have never even heardofthis condition before. In fact, most people areunfamiliar with ulcerative colitis, and now youare coping with your diagnosis. To start, you probably have lots of questions.Some of the most commonly asked ones are: What is ulcerative colitis?How did I get it?Will I be able to work, travel, or exercise?Should I be on a special diet?What are my treatment options?Will I need surgery?How will ulcerative colitis change my life,both now and in the future?Can ulcerative colitis be cured and whatis the outlook (prognosis)? The purpose of this brochure is to answer thosequestions, and to walkyou through the keypoints about ulcerative colitis and whatyou mayexpect in the future. You won't become an expertovernight, butyou'll learn more and more astime goes by. The more informed you are, thebetter you can manage your disease and becomean active member ofyour own healthcare team.194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1What is ulcerativecolitis?Ulcerative colitis a group of conditionsknown as inflammatory boweldiseases (IBD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition of thecolon (large intestine) that often occurs inteenagers and young adults, but also can occurin older individuals. The symptoms can includeabdominal pain, bowel urgency, diarrhea, andblood in the stool. The inflammation begins in the rectum and extends up the colon in acontinuous manner. While there is currently noknown cure, there are many effective therapiesto keep the inflammation under control. When reading about inflammatory bowel dis-eases, you need to know that ulcerative colitisis not the same thing as Crohn's disease, an-other type of IBD. The symptoms of these twoillnesses are quite similar, but the areas af-fected in your body are different. Crohn's dis-ease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract, but ulcerative colitis is limited to thecolon\u2014also called the large intestine. Crohn'sdisease can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while ulcerative colitis only involves the innermost lining of the colon. Finally, in Crohn's disease, the inflammation ofthe intestine can \"skip\"\u2014leaving normal areasin between patches of diseased intestine. In ulcerative colitis, this does not occur. In only 10percent of cases are there overlapping featuresof both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a condition called indeterminate colitis.2194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 23Will it ever go away? No one knows exactly what causes ulcerativecolitis. Also, no one can predict how the dis-ease\u2014once it is diagnosed\u2014will affect a partic-ular person. Some people go for years withouthaving any symptoms, while others have morefrequent flare-ups, or attacks, of their diseaseactivity. However, one thing is certain: ulcera-tive colitis is a chronic condition.Chronic conditions are ongoing situations. Theycan be controlled with treatment, but not cured.That means that the disease is a long-term condition. In fact, most medical illnesses, suchas diabetes, high blood pressure, and heartdisease, are successfully treated but not cured.Occasionally, people may develop severe com-plications that can be serious\u2014such as colorectalcancer\u2014but this occurs in a very small numberof people a/uniFB04icted with IBD. Studies show thatpeople with IBD usually have the same life ex-pectancy as people without IBD. It is importantto remember that most people who have ulcera-tive colitis lead full, happy, and productive lives.A brief introductionto the gastrointesti-nal (GI) tractMost of us aren't very familiarwith the GI tract, even thoughit occupies a lot of \"real estate\"in our bodies. Here's a quick overview:The GI tract (see gure 1)actually starts at the mouth. It follows a twistingand turning course and ends, many yards between are a number of or-gans that all play a part in processingand trans-porting food through the body.The rst is the esophagus, a narrow tube thatconnects the mouth to the stomach. Food passesthrough the stomach and enters the small in-testine. This is the section where most of ournutrients are absorbed. The small intestineleads to the colon, or large intestine, whichconnects to the rectum.The principal function of the colon is to absorbexcess water and salts from the waste material(what's left after food has been digested). It alsostores solid waste, converting it to stool, andexcretes it through the anus.The inflammation in ulcerative colitis usuallybegins in the rectum and lower colon, but italso can involve the entire colon. When inflam-mation occurs, the primary functions are affected, including the absorption of water. As a result, diarrhea can be a very commonsymptom during flares of UC. Figure 1194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 45Who ulcera-tive colitis or Crohn's disease.That number is almost evenly split between the two conditions. Here are some quick factsand gures:About 30,000 new cases of Crohn's diseaseand ulcerative colitis are diagnosed each year.On average, people are more frequently di-agnosed with ulcerative colitis between theages of 15 and 25, although the disease canoccur at any age.Males and females appear to be affectedequally.Men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in their 50s and 60s. While UC can affect those from any ethnicbackground, Caucasians develop it more thanother groups. It is especially prevalent amongthe Eastern European Jewish population.Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's diseaseare diseases found mainly in developedcountries, more commonly in urban areasrather than rural ones, and more often innorthern climates than southern ones. How-ever, some of these disease patterns aregradually shifting. For example, the numberof cases of IBD is increasing in developingparts of the world, including China, India,and South America.194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 56The genetic connection Researchers have discovered that ulcerative colitis tends to run in families. In fact, the risk of developing IBD is between 5.2 percent and 22.5 percent for rst-degree relatives of an affected person. It is also dependent on which family member has IBD, ethnicity, and the type of IBD\u2014either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Your genes clearly play a role, although no specic pattern of inheritance has yet been identied. That means that right now there is no way to predict which, if any, family members will develop ulcerative colitis. What causes ulcera- tive colitis? No one knows the exact cause(s) of the disease. One thing is certain: Nothing that you did made you get ulcerative colitis. You didn't catch it from anyone. It wasn't anything that you ate or drank that brought the symptoms on. Leading a stressful lifestyle didn't bring it on. So, above all, don't blame yourself! What are some of the likely causes? Most experts think there is a multifactorial explanation. This means that it takes a number of factors working in combination to bring about ulcerative colitis. The three leading factors suspected of con- tributing to UC are: 1) Environmental 2) Genetic 3) An inappropriate reaction by the body's immune systemIt's likely t genes tha ulcerative environme sponse. (S environme trigge Un doesn't \"t ues, dama causing th Wha and As the comes ulcera to abs waste throug That, in tu of the stoo damaged a lot of mu in the linin the stool t tually, tha blood cell Most peop an urgenc as crampy stronger o in the abd 194482_WO_36pg_R1 4/13/10 12:30 PM Page 67It's likely that a person inherits one or moregenes that make him or her susceptible toulcerative colitis. Then something in the environment triggers an abnormal immune re-sponse. (Scientists have not yet identied theenvironmental \"trigger\" or \"triggers.\") person's immunesystem to \"turn on\" and launch an attack in thelarge intestine. That's when the inflammationbegins. Unfortunately, the immune systemdoesn't \"turn off,\" so the inflammation contin-ues, damaging the lining of the colon and causing the symptoms of ulcerative colitis.What are the signsand symptoms?As the intestinal lining be-comes more inflamed and ulcerated, it loses its abilityto absorb water from thewaste material that passesthrough the colon. That, in turn, leads to a progressive looseningof the stool\u2014in other words, diarrhea. Thedamaged intestinal lining may begin producinga lot of mucus in the stool. Moreover, ulcerationin the lining can also cause bleeding, causingthe stool to become bloody in substance. Even-tually, that blood loss may lead to a low redblood cell count, also called anemia.Most people with ulcerative colitis experiencean urgency to have a bowel movement as wellas crampy abdominal pain. The pain may bestronger on the left side, but it can be anywherein the abdomen. 194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 78Together, these may result in loss of appetiteand subsequent weight loss. These symptoms,along with anemia, can lead to fatigue. Childrenwith ulcerative colitis may fail to develop orgrow properly. Beyond the intestineIn addition to having symptoms in the GI tract,some people also may experience a variety ofsymptoms in other parts of the body associatedwith ulcerative colitis. Signs and symptoms ofthe disease may be evident in:eyes (redness, pain, and itchiness)mouth (sores)joints (swelling and pain)skin (tender bumps, painful (primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitisand cirrhosis)\u2014a rare All of these are known as extraintestinalmani-festations of ulcerative colitis because theyoccur outside of the intestine. In some people,these actually may be the rst signs of ulcera-tive colitis, appearing even years before thebowel symptoms. In others, they may occurright before a flare-up of the disease.The range of symptomsApproximately half of all patients with ulcerativecolitis have relatively mild symptoms. However,others may suffer from severe abdominalcramping, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and fever.The symptoms of ulcerative colitis tend to come and go. 194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 89In between flares, people may experience nodistress at all. These disease-free periods(known as remission) can span monthsor evenyears, although symptoms typically do returneventually. The unpredictable course of ulcera-tive colitis may make it di/uniFB03cult for doctors toevaluate whether a particular treatment pro-gram has been effective or whether remissionoccurred on its own.Types of ulcerative colitis and theirassociated symptoms The symptoms of ulcerative colitis will vary depending on the extent of inflammation andthe location of the disease within the large in-testine. Accordingly, it is very important for youto know which part of your intestine is affected.Listed below are some of the most commontypes of ulcerative colitis:Ulcerative proctitis:Bowel inflammation islimited to the rectum. Because of its limitedextent (usually less than six inches of the rec-tum),ulcerative proctitis tends to be a milderform of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms includerectal bleeding, urgency, and rectal pain.Proctosigmoiditis:Colitis affecting the rectumand sigmoid colon (the lower segment ofcolon located right above the rectum). Symp-toms include bloody diarrhea, cramps, andtenesmus (straining to have a bowel move-ment). Moderate pain on the lower left sideof the abdomen may occur in active disease.Left-sided colitis:Continuous inflammationthat begins at the rectum and extends as faras the splenic flexure (a bend in the colonnear the spleen in the upper left abdomen).Symptoms include loss of appetite, weightloss, bloody diarrhea, and severe pain on the left side of the abdomen. Pan-ulcerative (total) or pancolitis:Affectsthe entire colon. Symptoms include loss ofappetite, bloody diarrhea, severe abdominalpain, and weight loss. 194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 910Possible complicationsComplications are by no means inevitable or even frequent\u2014especially in appropriatelytreated patients. But they are common enough,and cover such a wide range, that it is importantto be acquainted with them. Early recognition often means more effectivetreatment. Complications can include profuseintestinal bleeding (including clots of blood in the stool), severe abdominal distension(swelling), and toxic megacolon(a rare development). Please speak with your doctor regarding anyother possible complications. For further information on complications, please read ourbrochure, \"Managing Flares and Other IBDSymptoms.\" This is available at by calling 888.MY.GUT.PAIN (888-694-8872)to order a copy.Making the diagnosisHow does a doctor determineyou have ulcerative colitis? The path toward diagnosis begins by taking a complete patient and family medical history,including full details regarding symptoms. A physical examination is also performed.Since a number of other conditions can producethe same symptoms as UC, your doctor relies onvarious medical tests to rule out other potentialcauses for your symptoms, such as infection.Tests may include:Stool tests:Used to rule out infection or to reveal blood.194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1011Blood tests:May detect the presence of inflammation and antibodies.Sigmoidoscopy:Examines the rectum and lower third of the colon.Colonoscopy:Examines the entire colon and end of the small intestine. For further information on diagnosing ulcerativecolitis, please see our fact sheet, \"DiagnosingIBD,\" available at www.ccfa.org.Some questions to ask your doctor It is important to establishgood communications withyour doctor. It is common to forget to ask some criticalquestions during your o/uniFB03ce visit. Here is a listof questions that may be helpful for your nexto/uniFB03ce visit:Could any condition other than my diseasebe causing my symptoms?What tests do I need to have to get to theroot of my symptoms?Should I have these tests during the time of a flare-up or on a routine basis?What parts of my GI tract are affected?How will I know if my medication needs to be adjusted?Approximately how long should it take to seesome results, or to nd out that this may notbe the right medication for me?194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1112What are the side effects of the medication?What should I do if I notice them?What should I do if the symptoms return?What symptoms are considered an emergency?If I cannot schedule a visit right away, arethere any over-the-counter medication op-tions that can assist with my prescribed medication? If so, which ones?Should I change my diet or take nutritionalsupplements? If so, can you recommend a di-etitian or any specic nutritional supplements?Do I need to make any other lifestyle changes?When should I come back for a follow-up that maycontrol your UC and evenplace it into remission. These treatments work by decreasing the ab-normal inflammation in the lining of the colon.This permits the colon to heal. It also relievesthe symptoms of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, andabdominal pain.The two basic goals of treatment are to achieveremission and, once that is accomplished, tomaintainremission. If remission cannot be es-tablished, then the next goal is to decrease thedisease in order to improve the patient's qual-ity of life. Some of the medications used to accomplish this may be the same, but they are given in different dosages and for differentlengths of time.There is no \"one size ts all\" treatment foreveryone with ulcerative colitis. The approachmust be tailored to the individual because eachperson's disease is different. Medical treatmentcan bring about remission, which can last formonths to years, but the disease will flare up attimes from the reappearance of inflammationor from a particular trigger. Flares may indicatethe need to change the dose, frequency, or typeof medication. Although the medications usedfor ulcerative colitis are aimed at controlling in-flammation and maintaining a state of remission,some can also be used to address symptoms ofa flare. Physicians have been using a number of medica-tions for the treatment of ulcerative colitis formany years. Others are more recent break-194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1314throughs. The most commonly prescribed four basic categories:Aminosalicylates:These include thatcontain olsalazine, and balsalazide. These drugswork at the level of the lining of the GI tractto decrease inflammation. They also are useful as a maintenance treatment in pre-venting relapses of the disease.Corticosteroids:These medications affectthe body's ability to launch and maintain aninflammatory process. In addition, they workto keep the immune system in check. Theyare effective for short-term control of flare-ups; however, they are not recommended forlong-term or maintenance use because of theirside effects. If you cannot come off steroidswithout suffering a relapse of your symptoms,your doctor may need to add some othermedications to help manage your disease.Immunomodulators:This class of medicationsmodulates the body's immune system re-sponse so it cannot cause ongoing inflamma-tion. Immunomodulators generally are usedin people in whom aminosalicylates and cor-ticosteroids haven't been effective or havebeen only partially effective. They may beuseful in reducing or eliminating the need forcorticosteroids. They also may be effective inmaintaining remission in people who haven'tresponded to other medications given forthis purpose. Immunomodulators may takeseveral months to begin to work.Biologic therapies:Biologic therapies, alsoknown as anti-TNF agents, represent the lat-est class of therapy used for people with ul-cerative colitis who have not responded wellto conventional therapy. TNF (tumor necrosisfactor) is a chemical produced by our bodiesto cause inflammation. Antibodies are pro-teins produced to attach to these chemicals194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1415and allow the body to destroy the chemicaland reduce the inflammation. For further de-tailed information on treatment options, viewour \"Understanding IBD Medications andSide Effects\" brochure at www.ccfa.org.Managing your symptoms Even when there are no side effects, or justminimal ones, it may seem like a nuisance to beon a steady regimen of medication. Seek sup-port from your healthcare provider. Remember,though, that taking maintenance medicationcan signicantly reduce the risk of flares in ul-cerative colitis. In between flares, most peoplefeel quite well and free of symptoms.The best way to control ulcerative colitis is bytaking medications as recommended by yourdoctor. However, medications may not immedi-ately get rid of all the symptoms that you areexperiencing. You may continue to have occa-sional diarrhea, cramping, nausea, and fever.Talk to your doctor about which over-the-counter(OTC) medications you can take to help relievethose symptoms. These may include Lomotil\u00aeand loperamide(Imodium\u00ae) and should be takenas needed to control diarrhea.Most anti-gasproducts and digestive aids may also be safe touse. To reduce fever or ease joint pain, speakwith your doctor about taking acetaminophen 194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1517 16Class of Drugs Generic Name (Trade Name) Indication (Use) people with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis.

For further information on managing thesymptoms of ulcerative colitis, please read ourbrochure, \"Managing Flares IBDSymptoms.\"Other considerationsSurgeryMost people with ulcerative colitis respond wellto medical treatment and may never have to un-dergo surgery. However, between 25 percentand 33 percent of individuals may require surgeryat some point.Sometimes surgery is indicated to take care of various complications. These include severebleeding from deep ulcerations, perforation(rupture) of the bowel, and toxic megacolon. Surgery may also be considered to remove theentire colon and rectum (a proctocolectomy)when medical therapies no longer control thedisease well or when precancerous changes arefound in the colon. Unlike Crohn's disease,which can recur after surgery, ulcerative colitisactually is \"cured\" once the colon is removed.However, because ulcerative colitis is a diseasethat affects the immune system, extraintestinalsymptoms that occurred prior to surgery\u2014suchas joint pain or skin conditions\u2014may recur evenafter the colon is removed.Depending on a number of factors, includingthe extent of disease and the person's age andoverall health, one of two surgical approachesmay be recommended. The rst involves an external pouch, known as an ileostomy, whichis an opening on the abdomen through which194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 1819 nti-inflam- n, ibupro- eve\u00ae), v e s y s t e m . s t r u c t i o n s you do ging the read our r IBD i o n s pond well ave to un- percent r e s u r g e r y e care de severe ration colon. move the ctomy) trol the anges are ease, ve colitis emoved. a disease intestinal ery\u2014such e c u r e v e n cluding s age and proaches es an y, which h whichwaste is emptied into a synthetic bag attached to the ab dominal wall. The second is an internal pouch called an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) , or \"j-pouch,\" by attaching the small bowel to the anal sphincter muscle, which eliminates the need for an external ostomy appliance. To learn more about these surgeries, please read CCFA's surgery brochure . Diet and nutrition You may wonder if eating any particular foods caused or contributed to your ulcera tive colitis. The answer is \"no.\" However, once the disease has developed, paying attention to your diet may help you reduce symptoms, replace lost nutrients, and promote healing. There is no one single diet or eating plan that will work for everyone with ulcerative colitis. Di- etary recommendations must be tailored just for you\u2014depending on what part of your intes- tine is affected and what symptoms you ha ve. Ulcerative colitis varies from person to person and even changes within the same person over time. What worked for your friend with ulcerative colitis may not work for you. What worked for you last year may not work for you now. There may be times when modifying your diet can be helpful, particularly during a flare. Some diets may be recommended at different times by your physician, including: Low-sal t diet \u2014Used during corticosteroid therapy to reduce water retention. Low-ber diet \u2014Used to avoid stimulating bowel movements in ulcerative colitis. Low-fat diet \u2014Typically recommended during a flare when fat absorption may become an issue. Lactose-free diet \u2014For those who have an intolerance to dairy products.194482_WO_36pg_R1 4/13/10 12:30 PM Page 1920High-calorie diet\u2014For those who experienceweight loss or growth delay. Some patients with IBD may become decient incertain vitamins and minerals (including vitaminB-12, folic acid, vitamin C, iron, calcium, zinc,and magnesium) or have trouble ingestingenough food to meet their caloric needs. Yourdoctor can identify and correct these decienciesthrough vitamin and nutritional supplements.Keeping a food diary can be a big help. It allowsyou to see the connection between what youeat and the symptoms that may follow. If certainfoods are causing digestive problems, then tryto avoid them. Although no specic foodsworsen the underlying inflammation of ulcera-tive colitis, certain ones may tend to aggravatethe symptoms. Here are some helpful tips:Reduce the amount of greasy or fried foods inyour diet, which may cause diarrhea and gas.Eat smaller meals at more frequent intervals.Limit consumption of milk or milk products if you are lactose intolerant.Avoid carbonated beverages if excessive gasis a problem.Restrict caffeine when severe diarrhea occurs,as caffeine can act as a laxative.Bland, soft foods may be easier to toleratethan spicy foods.Restrict your intake of certain high-ber foodssuch as nuts, seeds, corn, and popcorn. Because they are not completely digested bythe small intestine, these foods may causediarrhea. That is why a low-ber, low-residuediet is often recommended. Maintaining proper nutrition is important in themanagement of ulcerative colitis. Good nutritionis essential in any chronic disease, but especially194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 2021 xperience e c i e n t i n n g v i t a m i n m, zinc, sting ds.

Abdominal pain and fever can cause loss of appetite and weight loss. Diarrhea and rectal bleeding can rob the body of fluids, min- erals, and electrolytes. These are nutrients in the body that must remain in proper balance for the body to function properly. That doesn't mean that you must eat certain foods or avoid others. Most doctors recommend a well-balanced diet to prevent nutritional de- ciency. A healthy diet should contain a variety of foods from all food groups. Meat, sh, poultry, and dairy products (if tolerated) are sources of protein; bread, cereal, starches, fruits, and veg- etables are sources of carbohydrates; margarine and oils are sources of fat. A dietary supplement, like a multivitamin, can help ll the gaps. For more info rmation, you may want to talk with a dietitian and read our \"Diet and Nutrition\" brochure, available at www.ccfa.org. Complementary and alternative therapies Some people living with ulcerative colitis look to complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) to use together with conventional thera- pies to help ease their symptoms. CAM thera- pies may work in a variety of ways. They may help to control sympto ms and ease pain, en- hance feelings of well-being and quality of life, and possibly boost the immune system. Speak with your doctor about the best therapies for your situation. For further information on com- plementary and alternative therapies, view our \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" fact sheet . Stress and emotion Ulcerative colitis affects virtually every aspect of a person's life. If you ha ve ulcerative colitis, you're bound to have questions about the relationship between stress and emotional factors and this disease. 194482_WO_36pg_R1 4/13/10 12:30 PM Page 2122Although the disease occasionally recurs aftera person has been experiencing emotionalproblems, there is no proof that stress causesulcerative colitis. It is much more likely that theemotional distress that people sometimes feelis a reaction to the symptoms of the disease itself. Individuals with ulcerative colitis shouldreceive understanding and emotional supportfrom their families and doctors. Because de-pression can be associated with chronic illness,a doctor may recommend an anti-depression medication and/or a referral to a mental healthprofessional. Although formal psychotherapyusually isn't necessary, some people are helpedconsiderably by speaking with a therapist who is knowledgeable about IBD or about chronicillness in general. In addition, CCFA offers localsupport groups to assist patients and their fam-ilies in coping with ulcerative colitis and Crohn'sdisease. Please review the list of other resourcesCCFA offers in the \"Knowledge & Support IsPower\" section at the end of this brochure.General health maintenanceIt is important to continue general health main-tenance. While working with your gastroen-terologist, also remember to speak with yourprimary care healthcare provider about otherimportant and periodic blood testing. For de-tailed information on general healthcare main-tenance in ulcerative colitis and a helpful chartfor your records, view our \"General HealthcareMaintenance\" fact sheet.Living your lifeLearning you have ulcerative colitis may be dif-cult and stressful. As time goes on, this factwill not always occupy the top spot in your mind.In the meantime, don't hide your conditionfrom family, friends, and co-workers. Discuss itwith them and let them help and support you.You'll learn that there are numerous strategiesthat can make living with ulcerative colitis easier.Coping techniques for dealing with the diseasemay take many forms. For example, attacks ofdiarrhea or abdominal pain may make peoplefearful of being in public places. But that isn'tnecessary. All it takes is some practical ad-vanced planning. You may want to incorporate some of the follow-ingsteps into your plans:Find out where the restrooms are in restau-rants, shopping areas, theaters, and on public transportation.Carry extra underclothing, toilet paper, ormoist wipes when traveling.When venturing further away or for longerperiods of time, speak with your doctor rst.Travel plans should include a long-term sup-ply of your medication, its generic name incase you run out or lose it, and the names of doctors in the area you will be visiting. Try to go about your daily life as normally aspossible, pursuing activities as you did beforeyour diagnosis. There's no reason for you to sit out on things that you have always enjoyedor have dreamed of doing one day. 194482_WO_36pg 4/7/10 4:35 AM Page 2324Learn coping strategies from others. Your local CCFA chapter offers support groups as well as informational meetings. The groups help you to share what you know with others, too. Develop a support network of family and friends to help you manage your disease. Bring a family member or friend to your doctor's appointment for support. Join CCFA's free online community at www.ccfacommunity.org to get the supp ort you need through participation in discussion boards and personal stories. Follow your doctor's instructions about taking medication (even when you are feeling perfectly well). Maintain a positive outlook. That's the basic\u2014and best\u2014prescription! While ulcerative colitis is a serious chronic dis- ease, it is not a fatal illness. There's no doubt that living with this illness is challenging\u2014you have to take medication and, occasionally, make other adjustments. It's important to remember that most people with ulcerative colitis are able to lead rich and productive lives.Remembe medicatio of ulcerati people are Hope Investi are de patien That's goo opment of a very exc therapies culprits in nology is m block infla treatment dict that a colitis is o With an ev of potenti greater ne these exp clinical tri your area, http://ww 888.MY.G Genetic st portant in new thera capable o intestinal disease pr It is becom immune re plays an im Crohn's di currently d sition, beh 194482_WO_36pg_R1 4/13/10 12:30 PM Page 2425Remember, too, maintenance medication can signicantly decrease flares of ulcerative colitis. In between flares, mostpeople are free of symptoms and feel well.Hope for the futureInvestigators all over the worldare devoted to research forpatients with ulcerative colitis.That's good news when it comes to the devel-opment of new therapies for this disease. It isa very exciting time in the development of newtherapies. Researchers are uncovering the culprits involved in ulcerative colitis, and tech-nology is making it possible to target them andblock inflammation. With many experimentaltreatments for IBD in clinical trials, experts pre-dict that a wave of new therapies for ulcerativecolitis is on the way. With an ever-increasing number of clinical trialsof potential new IBD therapies, there is an evengreater need for patient participation to see ifthese experimental therapies work. To locateclinical trials for ulcerative colitis therapies inyour area, go to CCFA's Web site athttp://www.ccfa.org/trials/, or call888.MY.GUT.PAIN (888-694-8872).Genetic studies also are expected to yield im-portant insights that will drive the search fornew therapies. The hope is that they may be capable of reversing the damage caused by intestinal inflammation, and even prevent thedisease process from starting in the rst place.It is becoming increasingly clear that a person'simmune response to normal intestinal bacteriaplays an important role in ulcerative colitis andCrohn's disease.
