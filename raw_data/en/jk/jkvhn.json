I am now 35years old and very well remember that until 2 years ago how I struggled with an irritable bowel, chronic fatigue, hair loss, short term memory problem, joint pains, dry skin, cold intolerance, panic attacks and more. I was then only 25years and when I visited a doctor, I was diagnosed with Hypothyroid after doing the blood test he had advised. Symptoms never disappeared even after taking the conventional medicine he advised for my problem. Then ultimately being tired of the conventional treatment, I finally sorted help of my mother's homeopathic doctor. He took my detailed case study and advised me to do a blood test to check out whether I had any thyroid antibody problem. He was right and I was actually suffering from Hashimoto's Thyroiditis or Autoimmune Thyroiditis. Then he prescribed me homoeopathic medicines with diet and de-stressing techniques. First my digestion began to improve, then my IBS disappeared, I started feeling very energetic, my memory started improving, my pains disappeared and my hairfall gradually stopped. Not only that my conventional medicines were also tapered. Hypothyroid occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormones. Hypothyroid is more common in women than men and the incidences increases with age. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (thyroid gland enlarges and forms goitre), Thyroid destruction following secondary to radioactive surgery, Severe iodine deficiency and Stress are known to cause Hypothyroid. Hashimoto's disease/ Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system turns against the body's own tissues. In people suffering from Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the immune system attacks the thyroid. This can lead to a condition called hypothyroid in which the thyroid does not make enough hormones for the body's need. The swelling in the neck is because the thyroid gland is swollen and enlarged. This condition is called as goitre. Benefits of Homoeopathic Medicines for Thyroid Diseases Homoeopathy helps to produce thyroid hormone naturally by stimulating the immune system and helps in better functioning of the thyroid gland. Homoeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own healing capacity by encouraging the body to reactivate hormone secretions. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. Stress causes hormonal disturbances in the body like thyroid problems s and is very effectively treated with homeopathy. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. If a patient is taking conventional [medicine for hypothyroid](https://www.drbatras.com/hypothyroidism), they can continue taking the medicine with homoeopathic medicine. Homoeopathic medication does not interfere with the absorption of conventional medicine and does not reduce its efficacy. Slowly and steadily when the thyroid hormones come to normalcy the conventional medicine can be tapered off and the person can continue with homoeopathy to avoid recurrence. What other care do I need to take? A gluten free diet would be of great help especially if you are a case of autoimmune thyroiditis/ Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Gluten resembles thyroid tissues. If you suffer from a leaky gut your body may mistakenly attack your thyroid believing it is attacking gluten molecules. This would cause the thyroid to remain underactive even after taking hormonal supplementations. Make sure you are taking a high quality multivitamin with iodine, zinc, selenium, iron, vitamin D and B12. Get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep.

Cod liver oil capsules are a great option as it contains Vitamin a, Vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids all together but under the guidance of your doctor. Filter your drinking water to avoid fluoride, chlorine and other halogens as they interfere with the thyroid function. Reduce stress levels.
