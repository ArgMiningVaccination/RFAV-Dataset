They will have to complete the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form, upload their proof of vaccination electronically and be prepared to show it, if asked by border officials. However, they may have to isolate based on vaccination and testing: - Two doses: people who have had two doses of vaccine at least 14 days before arriving in Nova Scotia will not have to self-isolate; testing is recommended - One dose: people who have had one dose of vaccine at least 14 days before arriving in Nova Scotia must self-isolate for at least seven days and cannot leave isolation until they get two negative tests results while in Nova Scotia; tests should be on day one or two and on day five or six - No doses: people who have not had any vaccine and those who had a first dose within 14 days of arrival must isolate for 14 days; testing at the beginning and end of their isolation continues to be recommended. \"We have all made huge sacrifices to battle this pandemic and we are too close to the end to take risks that could lead to another surge in cases,\" said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health. \"Public health decisions are all about balancing risks. We are doing that by taking one more week before we open fully to New Brunswick, by having entry requirements when we welcome people from outside Atlantic Canada, and by Nova Scotians getting vaccinated and continuing regular testing.\" Effective immediately, people travelling from New Brunswick with two doses do not have to isolate at all. Testing is recommended. Currently, anyone from outside Atlantic Canada who completes 14 days of isolation in Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland and Labrador can enter Nova Scotia without isolating again.
