In man y d ev el o p ing co un tri es, l ess than half th e po p ula ti o n has an account with a nancial insti tutio n, and in most of Africa less than one in ve households do. Recent development theory sees the lack of access to nance as a critical mechanism for generating persistent income inequality, as well as slower growth. Without inclusive nancial systems, poor individuals and small enterprises need to rely on their own limited savings and earnings to invest in their education, become entrepreneurs, or take advantage of promising growth opportunities. Financial sector policies that encourage competition, provide the right incentives to individuals, and help overcome access barriers are thus central not only to stability but also to growth, poverty reduction, and more equitable distribution of resources and capacities. The World Bank Group has long recognized that well-functioning nancial systems are essential for economic development. The work of its nancial sector has, over the years, emphasized the importance of nancial stability and ef ciency. Promoting broader access to nancial services, however, has received much less attention despite the emphasis it has received in theory. The access dimension of nancial development has often been overlooked, mostly because of serious data gaps in this area. Empirical evidence that links access to nancial services to development outcomes has been quite limited, providing at best tentative guidance for public policy initiatives. The increasing emphasis by policy circles in recent years on building more inclusive nancial systems thus highlights the need for better data and analysis. Measuring access to nance, its determinants, and its impact has been the focus of a major research effort at the Bank in recent years. FFA_fm.indd ix FFA_fm.indd ix 10/26/07 11:54:20 AM 10/26/07 research has included case-study analyses of speci c policies and interventions, as well as systematic analyses of extensive cross-country and micro data sets. Finance for All? presents rst efforts at developing indicators illustrating that nancial access is quite limited around the world and identi es barriers that may be preventing small rms and poor households from using nancial services. Based on this research, the report derives principles for effective government policy on broad-ening access. The report's conclusions con rm some traditional views and chal- lenge others. For example, recent research provides additional evidence to support the widely-held belief that nancial development promotes growth and illustrates the role of access in this process. Improved access to nance creates an environment conducive to new rm entry, innovation, and growth. However, research also shows that small rms bene t the most from nancial development and greater access\u2014both in terms of entry and seeing their growth constraints relaxed. Hence, inclusive nancial systems also have consequences for the composition and competition in the enterprise sector. The evidence also suggests that besides the direct bene ts of access to nancial services, small rms and poor households can also bene t indirectly from the effects of nancial development. For example, the poor may bene t from having jobs and higher wages, as better developed nancial systems improve overall ef ciency and promote growth and employment. Similarly, small rms may see their business opportuni- ties expand with nancial development, even if the nancial sector still mostly serves the large rms. Hence, pro-poor nancial sector policy requires a broader focus of attention than access for the poor: improving access by the excluded nonpoor micro and small entrepreneurs can have a strongly favorable indirect effect on the poor. Expanding access to nancial services remains an important policy challenge in many countries, with much for governments to do. However, not all government action is equally effective, and some policies can be counterproductive. Policy makers need to have realistic goals. For instance, while access to formal payment and savings services can approach universality as economies develop, not everyone will or should qualify for credit. There are instances where national welfare has been reduced by overly relaxed credit policies. Government policies in the nancial sector should focus on reforming institutions, developing infrastructures to take advantage of technologi- FFA_fm.indd x FFA_fm.indd x 10/26/07 11:54:21 AM 10/26/07 11:54:21 advances, encouraging competition, and providing the right incen- tives through prudential regulations. The report discusses experience and evidence of different government interventions\u2014such as those through taxes, subsidies, and direct ownership of institutions\u2014illustrating how they sometimes tend to be politicized, poorly structured, and bene cial mainly those who do not need the subsidy. In the absence of thorough economic evaluations of most schemes, their net effect in cost-bene t terms also remains unclear. Despite best efforts, it seems likely that provision of some nancial services to the very poor may require subsidies. Generally speaking, the use of subsidies in microcredit can dull the incentive for innovative new technologies in expanding access, with counterproductive long-term repercussions for the poor. Besides, evidence suggests that for poor house-holds credit is not the only\u2014or in many cases, the principal\u2014 nancial service they need. For example, in order to participate in the modern market economy even the poor need\u2014but often cannot access\u2014reliable, inexpensive, and suitable savings and payments products. Subsidies may sometimes be better spent on establishing savings and payment products appropriate to the poor. This report reviews and synthesizes a large body of research, and provides the basis for sound policy advice in the area of nancial access. We hope that it will contribute to the policy debate on how to achieve nancial inclusion. While much work has been done, much more remains to be learned. The ndings in this report also underline the importance of investing in data collection: continued work on measuring and evaluating the impact of access requires detailed micro data both at the household and enterprise level. The World Bank Group is committed to continuing work in the area of building inclusive nancial systems, helping member countries design nancial system policies that are rmly based on empirical evidence.

Financial institu-tions help mobilize savings and provide payments services that facilitate the exchange of goods and services. In addition, they produce and process information about investors and investment projects to enable ef cient allocation of funds; to monitor investments and exert corpo- rate governance after those funds are allocated; and to help diversify, transform, and manage risk. When they work well, nancial institutions and markets provide opportunities for all market participants to take advantage of the best investments by channeling funds to their most productive uses, hence boosting growth, improving income distribution, and reducing poverty. When they do not work well, opportunities for growth are missed, inequalities persist, and in the extreme cases, costly crises follow. Much attention has focused on the depth and ef ciency of nancial systems\u2014and for by de nition ef cient, allocating funds to their most productive uses. Well-functioning nancial systems serve other vital purposes as well, including offering savings, payments, and risk-management products to as large a set of participants as possible, and seeking out and nancing good growth opportunities wherever they may be. Without inclusive nancial systems, poor individuals and small enterprises need to rely on their personal wealth or internal resources to invest in their education, become entrepreneurs, or take advantage of promising growth opportuni-ties. Modern development theories increasingly emphasize the key role of Finance is an essential part of the development process\u2014 \u2014and a well-functioning system needs broad access, as well as depthFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 2access to nance: lack of nance is often the critical element underlying persistent income inequality, as well as slower growth. Earlier theories of development postulated that a rise in short-term inequality was an inevitable consequence of the early stages of develop-ment. However, it is increasingly recognized that inequality can adversely affect growth prospects\u2014which implies that wealth redistribution can spur development. Despite the emphasis that nancial market imper- fections now receive in theory, development economists have tended to advocate the adoption of redistributive public policies to improve wealth distribution and to foster growth. However, since nancial market imperfections that limit access to nance play an important role in perpetuating inequalities, nancial sector reforms that promote broader access to nancial services need to be at the core of the devel- opment agenda. Indeed, if nancial market frictions are not addressed, redistribution may have to be endlessly repeated, which could result in damaging disincentives to work and save. In contrast, building inclusive nancial systems focuses on equalizing opportunities. Hence, addressing nancial market imperfections that expand individual opportunities creates positive, not negative, incentive effects. While theory highlights the risk that selectively increased access could worsen inequality, both cross-country data and evidence from speci c policy experiments suggest that more-developed nancial systems are associated with lower inequal- ity. Hence, though still far from conclusive, the bulk of the evidence suggests that developing the nancial sector and improving access to nance are likely not only to accelerate economic growth, but also to reduce income inequality and poverty. Access to nancial services\u2014 nancial inclusion\u2014implies an absence of obstacles to the use of these services, whether the obstacles are price or nonprice barriers to nance. It is important to distinguish between access to\u2014the possibility to use\u2014and actual use of nancial services. Exclusion can be voluntary, where a person or business has access to services but no need to use them, or involuntary, where price barriers or discrimination, for example, bar access. Failure to make this distinction can complicate efforts to de ne and measure access. Financial market imperfections, such as information asymmetries and transaction costs, are likely to be especially binding on the talented poor and on micro- and small enterprises that lack collateral, credit histories, and connections. Without inclusive nancial systems, these individuals and enterprises with promising opportunities are limited to their own savings and Thus, access to nance helps to equalize opportunities and reduce inequalities\u2014 \u2014but the access dimension of nancial development has often been overlooked3OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY earnings. This access dimension of nancial development has often been overlooked, mostly because of serious data gaps on who has access to which nancial services and a lack of systematic information on the barriers to broader access. This report is a broad-ranging review of research work, completed or in progress, focusing on access to nance. The report presents indicators to measure nancial access, analyzes its determinants, and evaluates the impact of access on growth, equity, and poverty reduction, drawing on research that uses data both at the rm and household level. The report also discusses the role of government in advancing nancial inclusion, and these policy recommendations are stressed throughout the report. Although much remains to be learned, a signi cant amount of empirical analysis has been conducted on these issues over the past years. As with any review, taking stock of all this research also allows us to identify the many gaps in our knowledge and helps chart the way for a new genera-tion of research in this area. The report pays particular attention to the following themes: \u0081 Measuring access. How well does the nancial system in different countries directly serve poor households and small enterprises? Just how limited is nancial access? Who has access to which nancial services (such as deposit, credit, payments, insurance)? What are the chief obstacles and policy barriers to broader access? \u0081 Evaluating the impact of access. How important is access to nance as a constraint to the growth of rms? What are the channels through which improved access affects rm growth? What is the impact of access to nance on households and microenterprises? What aspects of nancial sector development matter for broadening access to different types of nancial ser- vices? What techniques are most effective in ensuring sustainable provision of credit and other nancial services on a small scale? \u0081 Adopting policies to broaden access. What is the government's role in building inclusive nancial systems? Given that nancial systems in many developing countries serve only a small part of the population, expanding access remains an important chal-lenge across the world, leaving much for governments to do. Not all government actions are equally effective, however, and some policies can be counterproductive. The report sets out principles for effective government policy on broadening access, drawing on the available evidence and illustrating with examples. This report presents access indicators, evaluates impact, and provides policy adviceFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 4While data on the nancial sector are often considered to be readily available, systematic indicators of access to different nancial services are not. Indeed, access is not easy to measure, and empirical evidence linking access to development outcomes has been quite limited because of lack of data. Existing evidence on the causal relations between nancial development, growth, and poverty is consistent with theory. However, most of the evidence comes either from highly aggregated indicators that use nancial depth measures instead of access or from micro studies that use nancial or real wealth to proxy for credit constraints. One of the key problems in assessing nancial inclusion is that\u2014 unlike indicators of nancial depth\u2014an analysis of aggregated data sets THIS OVERVIEW INTRODUCES THE MAIN MESSAGES of the report, pulling together theory, data, and analysis. It then presents the key policy implications of this material and highlights some of the challenges in the implementation of these recommendations. It concludes with directions for future research. Chapter 1 starts with analyses of the theoreti- cal models that illustrate the crucial role access to nance plays in the development process, particu- larly its infl uence on both growth and income dis- tribution. Then the chapter examines various data sets to assess the ability of both rms and households to access nancial services, to identify barriers to access, and to provide an empirical foundation to better understand the welfare impacts of broader nancial access. Chapter 2 focuses on the ability of rms, par- ticularly small rms, to access nancial services. It investigates not only the implications for growth and productivity for individual rms, and the economy at large, but also the impact that restrictive nancial access can have on the structure of the economy. The chapter also explores which aspects of nancial sector development matter for access to external nance\u2014 looking at banks, markets, and nonbank nance, and focusing especially on the role of foreign banks. Attention turns to households and microentre- preneurs in chapter 3, which examines whether an emphasis on nancial sector development as a driver of economic growth is consistent with a pro-poor approach to development. After reviewing the theory, empirical evidence at both the micro and macro levels is presented. The chapter then analyzes the barriers to access and how they can be overcome, with particular consideration given to the promise and limitations of micro nance. An analysis of the government's role in facilitating access to nancial services is presented in chapter 4. The chapter starts with a discussion of the important role that institution-building must play in improving access in particular an d nancial development in general. It then turns to measures to boost market capacity, improve competition and ef ciency, and regulate against exploitative and imprudent prac-tices. This is followed by a discussion of the impact that governments can have by owning or subsidizing nancial service providers; as an example, the case of government-backed credit guarantee schemes is l oo ked at in so m e dep th. Befo re co n cl uding, th e chapter considers key issues in the political economy of access. Outline of this report The rst step to improving access is measuring it\u2014 \u2014but the paucity of data presents methodological challenges5OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY has limited value. Simply knowing how many deposit accounts there are, for example, does not reveal much. Some individuals or rms may have multiple accounts, while others have none; moreover, regulatory authorities generally do not collect data on individual account holders. Therefore the best data would be generated by census or survey, which would allow researchers to measure nancial access across subgroups. Few such surveys exist for households, however, and the data sets that are available are often not compatible from one country to the next. In the absence of comprehensive micro data, researchers have sought to create synthetic headline indicators, combining more readily available macro data with the results of existing surveys. These headline indica-tors indicate that households around the world have limited access to and use of nancial services: in most developing countries less than half the population has an account with a nancial institution, and in many countries less than one in ve households does ( gure 1). Survey data on the access of rms to nance are more plentiful\u2014 although there are concerns about the representativeness of the surveys, particularly with regard to the inclusion of the informal sector (which is larger than the formal sector in many countries). Survey data indicate that less than 20 percent of small rms use external nance, about half the rate of large rms. And in three regions, at least 40 percent of rms report that access to and cost of nance is an obstacle to their growth ( gure 2).

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 6Why do large proportions of the populations in many developing coun- tries not use nancial services? Identifying the barriers that prevent small rms and poor households in developing countries from using nancial services not only helps researchers understand the reasons for nancial exclusion but also provides hints as to which policies could be helpful in removing these barriers and broadening access. One major constraint is geography, or physical access. While some nancial institutions allow clients to access services over the phone or via the Internet, some require clients to visit a branch or use an automated teller machine (ATM). While an ideal measure would indicate the average distance from household to branch (or ATM), the density of branches per square kilometer, or per capita, provides an initial, albeit crude, indicator. For example, Spain has 96 branches per 100,000 people and 790 branches per 10,000 square kilometers, while Ethiopia has less than 1 branch per 100,000 people and Botswana has 1 branch per 10,000 square kilometers. Another barrier is the lack of proper documentation. Financial institu- tions usually require one or more documents for identi cation purposes, but in many low-income countries, most people\u2014especially those not employed in the formal sector (who are usually poor)\u2014lack such papers.

For example, it is not unusual for banks to require a person opening a checking account to make a minimum deposit equivalent to 50 percent of that country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP). While barriers to access vary signi cantly across countries, lower barriers tend to be associated with more open and competitive banking systems. Such systems are characterized by private ownership of banks, including foreign ownership; strong legal, information, and physical infrastructures (such as telecommunication and road networks); regula-tory and supervisory approaches that rely heavily on market discipline; and substantial transparency and media freedom. However, access indicators are just that\u2014indicators. While they are linked to policy, they are not policy variables. Thus, creating indicators is only the beginning of the effort. Analytical work collecting and using in-depth household and enterprise information on access to and use of nancial services is necessary to understand the impact of nancial access and to design better policy interventions. Better data and analysis will help researchers assess which nancial services\u2014savings, credit, payments, insurance\u2014are most important in achieving development outcomes for both households and rms, and will inform efforts to nar- row down which cross-country indicators to track over time. Evaluating the impact of access to nance for rms One of the important channels through which nance promotes growth is the provision of credit to the most promising rms ( gure 3). Many rms, particularly small ones, often complain about lack of access to nance. Recent research using detailed rm-level data and survey infor- mation provides direct evidence suggesting that such complaints are valid in that limited access stunts rms' growth. This nding is supported by studies based on census data and individual case studies using detailed loan information. Access to nance, and the institutional underpinnings associated with better nancial access, favorably affects rm performance along a number of different channels. Improvements in the functioning of the formal nancial sector can reduce nancing constraints for small rms and oth- ers who have dif culty in self- nancing or in nding private or informal sources of funding. Research indicates that access to nance promotes Barriers to access vary signi cantly across countries Access to nance can promote new- rm entry, growth, innovation, optimum size, and risk reduction\u2014FINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 8more start-ups: it is smaller rms that are often the most dynamic and innovative. Countries that strangle this potential with nancial barri- ers not only lose the growth potential of these enterprises but also risk missing opportunities to diversify into new areas of hitherto unrevealed comparative advantage. Financial inclusion also enables incumbent rms to reach a larger equilibrium size by enabling them to exploit growth and investment opportunities. Furthermore, greater nancial inclusion allows rms the choice of more ef cient asset portfolios as well as more ef cient organizational forms, such as incorporation. If stronger nancial systems can promote entry of new rms, enterprise growth, innovation, larger equilibrium size, and risk reduction, then it is almost inescapable that stronger nancial systems will improve aggregate economic performance. Improved nance does not raise aggregate rm Figure 3 Finance helps rms grow faster Source: Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998).

At any given level of nancial development, smaller rms have more dif culty accessing external nance than do larger companies. But with nancial development and greater availability of external nance, rms that were formerly excluded are given opportunities. Research shows that small rms bene t the most from nancial development\u2014both in terms of being able to enter the marketplace and of seeing their growth constraints relaxed. Hence, inclusive nancial sectors also have consequences for the composition of and competition in the enterprise sector. Firms nance their investments and operations in many different ways, depending on a wide range of factors both internal and external to the individual rm. The availability of external nancing depends not only on a rm's own situation, but on the wider policy and institutional environment supporting the enforceability and liquidity of the contracts that are involved in nancing rms. And it also depends on the existence and effectiveness of a variety of intermediaries and ancillary nancial rms that help bring providers and users of funds together in the market. Bank nance is typically the major source of external nance for rms of all sizes. Modern trends in transactional lending suggest that improve-ments in information availability (for example, through development of credit registries) and technological advances in analysis of this improved data (for example, through use of automated credit appraisal) are likely to improve access of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to nance. Provided that the relevant laws are in place, asset-based lending such as factoring, xed-asset lending, and leasing are other technologies that can release sizable nancing fl ows even for small and nontransparent rms. However, relationship lending (which relies on personal interaction between borrower and lender and is based on an understanding of the borrower's business and not just on collateral or mechanical credit scor-ing systems) will remain important in environments with weak nancial infrastructures and strong informal economic activity. Because relation-ship lending is costly for the lender, it requires either high spreads or large volumes to be viable. If the customer's creditworthiness is hard to evaluate, then there may be no alternative to relationship lending. Indeed, limited access to credit in some dif cult environments may be attributable to the reluctance of existing intermediaries to do relation-ship lending on a small scale. Use of modern transactional lending by banks helps reach more rms \u2014but relationship lending will remain important for informal economic activityFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 10The role of foreign banks in improving access has always been controversial, partly for political reasons. The growing market share of foreign-owned banks in developing and transition economies has resulted from a number of forces, including the privatization of long-established state-owned banks and the sale of distressed banks in the aftermath of banking crises (often after being nancially restructured at the expense of the host country government). Foreign owners bring capital, technol-ogy, know-how, and independence from the local business and political elites, but debate continues over whether they have improved access. Most foreign banks are relatively large and do not concentrate on SME lending, sticking mostly to the banking needs of large rms and high- net-worth individuals. However, the increased competition for large customers can drive local banks to focus more on providing pro table services to segments they had once neglected. The balance of a large body of evidence suggests that a country that allows foreign banks to operate within its borders is likely, over time, to improve nancial access for SMEs, even if the foreign banks con ne their lending to large rms and government. In contrast, the performance of state-owned banks in this dimension has tended to be poor. Nonbank nance remains much less important than bank nance in m ost d ev el o p ing co un tri es, b u t i t can p la y an im po rtan t r o l e in improving the price and availability of longer-term nance to smaller borrowers. Bond nance, for example, can provide a useful alternative to bank nance. The emergence of a large market in external equity requires strong investor rights; where these are present, opening to foreign capital infl ows can greatly improve access and lower the cost of capital, with spillover effects for smaller rms. This is true for portfolio equity investments, foreign direct investment (FDI), and private equity, all of which are likely to become increasingly important in the future. Evaluating impact of access to nance for households Over the long term, economic growth helps reduce poverty and can be expected to lift the welfare of most households. Evidence suggests not only that nance is pro-growth but that it reduces income inequality ( gure 4) and is pro-poor. How important in this process is the direct provision of nancial services to poor households and individuals? Existing evidence suggests that indirect, second-round effects through Foreign banks are likely to increase access for SMEs\u2014 \u2014and the role of nonbank nance is likely to increase 11OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY more ef cient product and labor markets might have a greater impact on the poor than direct access to nance. First, aggregate regressions yield more robust results of a dampening effect of nance on inequal- ity and poverty, while micro studies, which do not consider spillover effects, provide a more tenuous picture. Similarly, calibrated general equilibrium models that take into account labor market effects suggest that the main impact of nance on income inequality comes through inclusion of a larger share of the population in the formal economy and higher wages. Hence, the evidence so far seems to suggest that direct provision of nancial services to the poor may not be the most important channel through which nance reduces poverty and income inequality. Therefore, fostering more ef cient capital allocation through competitive and open nancial markets should remain an important policy goal, Figure 4 Finance and income inequality Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007). Note: The gure is a partial scatterplot of growth of Gini coef cient vs. private credit/GDP, controlling for initial levels Gini. Private credit in ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 12and it is as relevant for reduction of poverty and inequality as it is for overall economic growth. In many countries, however, access to nancial services is limited to only 20-50 percent of the population, excluding many nonpoor individuals and SMEs. That being the case, improving the quality of the services provided and the ef ciency with which they are provided without broadening access is not enough: it would leave large segments of the population and their talents and innovative capacity untapped. The provision of better nancial access to these excluded nonpoor micro- and small entrepreneurs can have an especially favorable indirect effect on the poor. Hence, to promote pro-poor growth, it is important to improve access not only to the poor but to all who are currently excluded. That is not to say that improvements in direct access for the poor should be neglected. The bene ts here may be more modest in the long run, but they can be immediate. There are many reasons for the limited access to nancial services, especially in the case of the poor. The poor may not have anybody in their social network who understands the various services that are avail-able to them. Lack of education may make it dif cult for them to ll out loan applications, and the small number of transactions they are likely to undertake may make loan of cers think it is not worthwhile to help them. As nancial institutions are likely to be located in rich neighbor- hoods, physical distance may also matter\u2014banks simply may not be near the poor. Even if nancial service providers are nearby, some poor clients may encounter prejudice\u2014being refused admission to banking of ces, for example. The poor face two signi cant problems in obtain- ing access to credit services. First, they typically have no collateral and cannot borrow against their future income because they tend not to have steady jobs or income streams that creditors can track. Second, dealing with small transactions is costly for the nancial institutions. The new wave of specialized micro nance institutions serving the poor has tried to overcome these problems in innovative ways. Loan of cers come from similar backgrounds and go to the poor, instead of waiting for the poor to come to them. Group-lending schemes improve repay-ment incentives and monitoring through peer pressure, and they also build support networks and educate borrowers. Increasing loan sizes as customers demonstrate their ability to borrow and repay reduces default rates. The effectiveness of these innovations in different settings is still being debated, but over the past few decades, micro nance institutions have managed to reach millions of clients and have achieved impressive \u2014but there are barriers to increasing access Joint lending and dynamic incentives may increase inclusion\u2014Financial exclusion extends beyond the poor in many countries\u201413OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY repayment rates. Even though subsidies are often involved, researchers are reconsidering whether it might be possible to make pro ts while p r o vi ding nan cial se rvi ces t o so m e o f th e w o r l d' s poo r est. In d eed, mainstream banks have begun to adopt some of the techniques used by the micro nance institutions and to enter some of the same markets. For many, however, the most exciting promise of micro nance is that it could reduce poverty without requiring continuous subsidies. Has micro nance been able to meet its promise? While many heart- ening case studies are cited\u2014from contexts as diverse as the slums of Dhaka to villages of Thailand to rural Peru\u2014it is still unclear how big an impact micro nance has had on poverty overall. Methodological dif culties in evaluating impact, such as selection bias, make it dif cult to reach any solid conclusion. So far, the evidence from microeconomic studies, taken together, does not unambiguously show a reduction in poverty. Additional research\u2014ideally using more eld experiments\u2014is needed to convince the skeptics. One of the most controversial questions about micro nance is the extent of subsidy required to provide access. Although group lending and other techniques are employed to overcome the obstacles involved in delivering services to the poor, these mechanisms are nevertheless costly, and the high repayment rates have not always translated into pro ts. Overall, much of the micro nance sector\u2014especially the segment that serves the very poor\u2014still remains heavily dependent on grants and subsidies. Recen t research con rms that there is a trade-off between pro tability and serving the very poor. Micro nance has traditionally focused on the provision of credit for very poor entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts often emphasize how micro nance will unleash the productive potential of these borrowers, leading to productivity increases and growth. Yet much of microcredit is not used for investment. Instead, a sizable fraction of it goes to meet important consumption needs. These are not a secondary concern. For poor households, credit is not the only, or in many cases the priority, nancial service they need: good savings and payments (domestic as well as international) services and insurance may rank higher. For example, one reason why the poor may not put any savings in nancial assets may be the lack of appropriate savings products. The question, then, has two parts: Should nance for the very poor be subsidized, and if so, is micro nance the best way to provide those subsidies? The answer requires comparing costs and bene ts of subsidies \u2014but the welfare impact of micro nance is not clear\u2014 \u2014and much of the micro nance sector relies on grants and subsidies The poor need other services in addition to credit\u2014 \u2014and the very poor will require subsidies to access nancial servicesFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 14in the nancial sector with those in other areas, such as education and infrastructure. The clear need for the latter set a high threshold if scarce public funds are to be diverted to subsidizing access. Within the nancial sector, the case for subsidizing savings and payments services, which can be seen as basic services necessary for participation in a modern market economy, seems stronger than that for credit. In the case of credit, inter-est rate subsidies in particular do not seem to be the way to go, given their negative incentive effects on repayment, the likelihood that much of the subsidy will in practice be diverted away from the target group, and the chilling effect on unsubsidized service providers just starting to provide small-scale credit. Instead, policies that encourage entry in general are more promising, as are policies that promote the adoption of novel techniques (such as those that take advantage of the already wide and increasing availability of mobile phones). Once in place, such techniques lower the unit cost of service delivery to the poor. Policies to broaden access Perhaps more important, improving nancial access in a way that bene ts the poor to the greatest extent requires a strategy for inclusion that goes well beyond credit for poor households. Since expanding access remains an important challenge even in developed economies, it is not enough to say that the market will provide. Market failures related to information gaps, the need for coordination on collective action, and concentrations of power mean that governments everywhere have an important role to play in building inclusive nancial systems. Not all government action is equally effective, however, and some policies can be counterproduc-tive. Direct government interventions to support access require careful evaluation, something that is often missing. Our discussion is selective, setting out principles for effective government policy, drawing on and generalizing lessons from speci c examples that illustrate how other issues can be approached. Even the most ef cient nancial system supported by a strong contrac- tual and information infrastructure faces limitations. Not all would-be bor-rowers are creditworthy, and there are numerous examples where national welfare has been reduced by overly relaxed credit policies. Access to formal payment and savings services can approach universality as economies develop. However, not everyone will\u2014or should\u2014qualify for credit. It is important to have realistic goals 15OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY Dee p insti tu ti o nal r ef o rm e ns uring, abo v e all , securi ty o f p r o p- erty rights against expropriation by the state is an underlying, albeit often long-term, prerequisite for well-functioning nancial systems. Prioritizing some institutional reforms over others, however, would help focus reform efforts and have a positive impact on access in the short to medium term. Recent evidence suggests that information infrastructures ma tt e r m ost in l o w - in co m e co un tri es, whil e e nf o r ce m e n t o f cr edi t o r rights is more important in high-income countries. Another nding is that in relatively underdeveloped institutional environments, procedures that enable individual lenders to recover on debt contracts (for example, those related to collateral) are more important in boosting bank lend-ing compared with those procedures mainly concerned with resolving confl icts between multiple claimants (for example, bankruptcy codes). Given that it is potentially easier to build credit registries and reform procedures related to collateral compared with making lasting improve-ments in the enforcement of creditor rights and bankruptcy codes, these are important ndings for prioritizing reform efforts. Encouraging the development of speci c infrastructures (particularly in information and debt recovery) and of nancial market activities that can use technology to bring down transaction costs will produce results sooner than long-term institution building. Speci c activities include establishing credit registries or issuing individual identi cation numbers to help establish and track credit histories; reducing costs of registering or repossessing collateral; and introducing speci c legislation to underpin modern nancial technology\u2014including leasing and factoring, electronic nance, and mobile nance. Encouraging openness and competition is also an essential part of broadening access, because they spur incumbent institutions to seek pro table ways of providing services to previously excluded segments of the population and increase the speed with which access-improving new technologies are adopted. Foreign banks have an important role to play in expanding access, as discussed above. In this process, providing the private sector with the right incentives is key; hence good prudential regulations are a necessity. Competition that helps foster access can also result in reckless or improper expansion if not accompanied by the proper regulatory and supervisory framework. As increasingly complex international regulations\u2014such as those envis-aged in the advanced versions of the Basel II system\u2014are imposed on banks to help minimize the risk of costly bank failures, it is important Reforming institutions\u2014 \u2014developing nancial infrastructures to take advantage of technological competition\u2014 \u2014and providing the right incentivesFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 16to ensure that these arrangements do not inadvertently penalize small borrowers. That can happen if banks are not able to make full allowance for the potential risk-pooling advantages of including SME loans in their overall loan portfolio. Research suggests that while banks making small loans have to set aside larger provisions against the higher expected loan losses from small loans\u2014and therefore they need to charge higher rates of interest to cover these provisions\u2014they should need relatively less capital to cover the risk that they will lose more than they have anticipated. A variety of other regulatory measures is needed to support wider access. Sometimes the most effective measure is not the most obvious one. For example, interest ceilings fail to provide adequate consumer protec-tion against abusive lending. Increased transparency and formalization and enforced lender responsibility are more coherent approaches, along with support for the overborrowed (such as assistance in nding a viable workout plan or formalized personal bankruptcy schemes). However, delivering all of this is can be administratively demanding. The scope for direct government interventions in improving access is more limited than often believed. A large body of evidence suggests that efforts by government-owned subsidiaries to provide credit have generally not been successful. Direct intervention through taxes and subsidies can be effective in certain circumstances, but experience suggests that they are more likely to have large unintended consequences in nance than in other sectors. For example, with direct and directed lending programs discredited in recent years, partial credit guarantees have been the direct in t e rv e n ti o n m echanis m o f ch o i ce p ush ed b y S ME cr edi t acti vists. However, these are often poorly structured, embody hidden subsidies, and bene t mainly those who do not need the subsidy. In the absence of thorough economic evaluations of most of these guarantee schemes, their net effect in cost-bene t terms also remains unclear. In nonlending services, the experience has been mixed. A few gov- ernment nancial institutions have moved away from providing credit and evolved into providers of more complex nancial services, entering into public-private partnerships to help overcome coordination failures, rst-mover disincentives, and obstacles to risk sharing and distribution that impede outreach to SMEs by banks. Ultimately, these successful initiatives could have been undertaken by private capital, but the state had a useful role in jump-starting these services. A comprehensive approach to nancial sector reform aiming at better access must take political realities into account. If the interest of power-ful incumbents is threatened by the emergence of new entrants nanced The role for direct government intervention is limited Political economy concerns are key in implementing policies to expand access17OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY by a system that has improved access and outreach, lobbying by those incumbents can block the needed reforms. Given that challenges of nan- cial inclusion and bene ts from broader access go well beyond ensuring nancial services for the poor, de ning the access agenda more broadly to expand access for all, would include the middle classes and help mobilize greater political support for advancing the agenda around the world. Directions for future research While this report reviews and highlights a large body of research, it also identi es man y gaps in o ur kn o wl edge. M u ch m o r e r esear ch is FINANCIAL MARKET IMPERFECTIONS THAT LIMIT access to nance are key in most development theories. Lack of access to nance is often the critical mecha- nism behind both persistent income inequality and slow economic growth. Hence nancial sector reforms that promote broader access to nancial services should be at the core of the development agenda. Access is not easy to measure, and empirical evi- dence linking access to development outcomes has been quite scarce due to lack of data. Initial efforts indicate that nancial access is quite limited around the world and that barriers to access are common. Further research to assess the impact of access on outcomes such as growth and poverty reduction will require better micro data, particularly data derived from household and enterprise surveys. Empirical evidence suggests that improved access to nance is not only pro-growth but also pro-poor, reducing income inequality and poverty. Hence nancial development that includes small rms and the poor disproportionately bene ts those groups. Providing better nancial access to the nonpoor micro- and small entrepreneurs can have a strongly favorable indirect effect on the poor. Spillover effects of nancial development are likely to be signi cant. Hence, to promote pro-poor growth, it is important to broaden the focus of attention from nance for the poor to improving access for all who are excluded. Provision of nancial services to the very poor will require subsidies. If subsidies for credit dam-age the ability and incentives of the micro nance industry and the nancial sector more generally to make use of innovative new technologies in provid-ing access for the nonpoor, their effect on the poor could be counterproductive. However, for poor households, credit is not the only\u2014or in many cases, the principal\u2014 nancial service they need. Subsidies may be better spent on savings and payment systems because those services are necessary for participation in a modern market economy. Government policies should focus on building sound nancial institutions, encouraging compe-tition (including foreign entry), and establishing sound prudential regulation to provide the private sector with appropriate incentive structures and broaden access. Governments can facilitate the development of an enabling nancial infrastructure and encourage adoption of new technologies, but attempts at direct intervention (through subsidies, for example, or ownership of nancial institutions) are more likely than not to be counterproductive. Main messages of this report FINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 18needed to measure and track access to nancial services, to evaluate its impact on development outcomes, and to design and evaluate policy interventions. New development models link the dynamics of income distribution and aggregate growth in uni ed models. There are good conceptual reasons for believing that nancial market frictions play an important role in the persistence of income inequalities, but there is too little theory that examines how reducing these frictions may affect the opportunities faced by individuals and the evolution of relative income levels. Future theoretical work could usefully study the impact of nancial sector policies on growth and income distribution within the context of these models and provide new insights. Lack of systematic information on access is one of the reasons why empirical research on access has been limited. The efforts described above in developing cross-country indicators of access are only rst steps in this direction. This work should be continued and expanded, both in terms of country coverage and coverage of institutions and different services available. Building data sets that benchmark countries annually would help focus policymaker attention and allow better tracking and evaluation of reform efforts to broaden access. Furthermore, while cross-country indicators of access are useful for benchmarking, any assessment of the impact of access on outcomes such as growth and poverty reduction requires data at the household and enterprise level. Few household surveys focus on nancial services. Efforts to collect this data systematically around the world are important in improving the understanding of access. Indeed, household surveys are often the only way to get detailed information on who uses which nancial services from which types of institutions, including informal ones. Emerging evidence suggests that nancial development reduces income inequality and poverty, yet researchers are still far from understanding the channels through which this effect operates. The nance-growth channel is better understood: rms' access to nance has been shown to have signi cant payoffs in many areas, from promoting entrepreneurship and innovation to better asset allocation and rm growth. But how does nance infl uence income distribution? How important is direct provi- of nance for the poor? Which is more important: improving the functioning of the nancial system so that it expands access to existing \u2014and more comprehensive and consistent data A better understanding of the impact of nanceMore theory work\u201419OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY customers, or broadening access to the underserved (including the non- poor who are often excluded in many developing countries)? Results of general equilibrium models and evidence at the aggregate level hint that a narrow focus on giving just the poor better direct access is not the best policy. Instead, the poor will bene t most by policies that broaden access in general; moreover, spillover effects of nancial develop- ment are likely to be important for the poor by improving employment opportunities and wages. However, simply improving competition and the available services for those already served by the nancial system is not likely to be enough either. In many countries improving ef ciency will require that access be broadened beyond concentrated incumbents, since a large proportion of the nonpoor as well as the poor are currently excluded. Hence the ef ciency and access dimensions of nance are likely to be closely linked, but more research is needed to sort out the relative importance of these effects on growth and poverty. In evaluating impact, randomized eld experiments are promising. These experiments operate by varying the treatments of randomly selected subsamples of the surveyed households or microentrepreneurs. For instance, they could be offered different nancial products, or dif- ferent terms and conditions, or different amounts of training in nancial literacy. Such random variation allows the researchers to make reliable inferences about how removing barriers and improving access will affect growth and household welfare. While this report discusses some of this research, more experiments need to be conducted in different country contexts, focusing on different dimensions of access. Ultimately, it is this welfare impact that should determine which access indicators should be tracked and how policy should be designed. Policies to broaden access can take many forms, from improvements in the functioning of mainstream nancial products to innovations in micro nance. Lack of careful evaluation of different interventions makes it dif cult to assess their impact and draw broader lessons. Careful research in this area would also help improve design of policy interven-tions to build more inclusive nancial systems. Randomized eld experiments may provide insights on welfare impact21CHAPTER ONE Access to Finance and Development: Theory and Measurement FINANCE IS AT THE CORE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. BACKED by solid empirical evidence, development practitioners are becoming increasingly convinced that ef cient, well-functioning nancial systems are crucial in channeling funds to the most productive uses and in allo-cating risks to those who can best bear them, thus boosting economic growth, improving opportunities and income distribution, and reducing poverty. 1 Conversely, to the extent that access to nance and the avail- able range of services are limited, the bene t of nancial development is likel y t o el u d e man y in di vi d uals an d e n t e rp rises, l ea ving m u ch o f the population in absolute poverty. This access dimension of nancial development is the focus of this report. Improving access and building inclusive nancial systems is a goal that is relevant to economies at all levels of development. The challenge of better access means making nancial services available to all, thereby spreading equality of opportunity and tapping the full potential in an economy. The challenge is greater than ensuring that as many people as poss i b l e ha v e access t o b as i c nancial services. It is just as much about enhancing the quality and reach of credit, savings, payments, insurance, and other risk management products in order to facilitate sustained growth and productivity, especially for small and medium-scale enterprises. Although the formal nancial sector in a few countries has achieved essentially universal coverage of the population, at least for basic services, some nancial exclusion persists even in many high-income countries (and, because they nd it dif cult to participate fully in those sophisticated economies, nancial exclusion can be an even more serious handicap for those affected). Well-functioning nancial systems can boost growth and reduce poverty 21 10/26/07 12:30:04 PM 10/26/07 12:30:04 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 22Theoreticians have long reasoned that nancial market frictions can be the critical mechanism for generating persistent income inequality or poverty traps. Without inclusive nancial systems, poor individuals and small enterprises need to rely on their personal wealth or internal resources to invest in their education, become entrepreneurs, or take advantage of promising growth opportunities. Financial market imper-fections, such as information asymmetries and transactions costs, are likely to be especially binding on the talented poor and the micro- and small enterprises that lack collateral, credit histories, and connections, thus limiting their opportunities and leading to persistent inequality and slower growth. However, this access dimension of nancial development has often been overlooked, mostly because of serious gaps in the data about who has access to which nancial services and about the barriers to broader access. Despite the emphasis nancial access has received in theory, empirical evidence that links broader access to development outcomes has been very limited, providing at best tentative guidance for public policy initiatives in this area. Financial inclusion, or broad access to nancial services, implies an absence of price and nonprice barriers in the use of nancial services; it is dif cult to de ne and measure because access has many dimensions. Services need to be available when and where desired, and products need to be tailored to speci c needs. Services need to be afford- able, taking into account the indirect costs incurred by the user, such as having to travel a long distance to a bank branch. Efforts to improve inclusion should also make business sense, translate into pro ts for the providers of these services, and therefore have a lasting effect. The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, it briefl y reviews the theoretical models that incorporate capital market imperfections to illus-trate how improved access to nance is likely to reduce inequality as well as promote growth and, through both channels, lead to a reduction in poverty. Many types of policy measures aimed at reducing poverty and inequality through redistributive measures such as land reform can have adverse side-effects on incentives. If the underlying causes of inequal-ity are not removed, the effect of such redistributive measures may be only temporary and require repetition. A complementary development strategy would directly address the underlying causes, including capital market imperfections (in addition to redistributive policies). Financial sector reforms to achieve this goal can represent a rst-best policy to promote growth and poverty reduction and would also make redistribu-tion more effective and sustainable.Financial market frictions can generate poverty traps Measuring access can be dif cult This chapter reviews the theoretical models\u2014 22 TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT Second, the chapter presents indicators of access to and use of nancial services that households and small rms are likely to need. Developing better indicators of access to nance is essential to strengthen the link between theory and empirical evidence and to investigate the channels through which a more developed nancial system promotes develop- ment, both in terms of growth and poverty reduction. Indeed, the ext e n t o f dir ect access t o nancial services by households and small enterprises varies sharply around the world, with very limited access in many countries. Theory: The Crucial Role of Access to Finance Modern development theory studies the evolution of growth, relative income inequalities, and their persistence in uni ed models. In many of these models, nancial market imperfections play a central role, infl uenc- ing key decisions regarding human and physical capital accumulation and occupational choices. For example, in theories stressing capital accumula-tion, nancial market imperfections determine the extent to which the poor can borrow to invest in schooling or physical capital. In theories stressing entrepreneurship, nancial market imperfections determine the extent to which talented but poor individuals can raise external funds to initiate projects. Thus, the evolution of nancial development, growth, and intergenerational income dynamics are closely intertwined. Finance infl uences not only the ef ciency of resource allocation throughout the economy but also the comparative economic opportunities of individuals from relatively rich or poor households. This crucial focus on the nancial sector in economic modeling has been strengthened with the historical development of views on the links between economic growth and income inequality. It was long believed tha t th e ear l y stages o f eco n o mi c d ev el o p m e n t w o ul d in evi tab l y be accompanied by inequality and concentrations of wealth. Pointing to the fact that rich people's marginal propensity to save is higher than that of the poor, theoreticians argued that the need to nance large, indivisible investment projects in the process of development implied that rapid growth would need wealth concentration, leading to a fundamental trade-off between growth and social justice. More generally, Kuznets (1955, 1963) reasoned that this trade-off meant that inequality would increase in the early stages of development until the bene ts of growth spread throughout the economy. Some of the earlier empirical evidence \u2014and presents access indicators for households and small rms Empirical evidence suggests that the link between growth and inequality is ambiguous FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 23 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 23 10/26/07 12:30:06 PM 10/26/07 12:30:06 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 24from the United States and other developed countries supported the Kuznets hypothesis. But evidence from developing countries was not so supportive. 2 The importance of providing incentives to reward the productive ef ciency of enterprise and investment might seem to imply that growth and inequality must be positively linked, but empirical studies suggest that this is not always so. In particular, while very low inequality is indeed empirically associated with rapid subsequent growth, the highest rates of growth are associated with moderate inequality. Furthermore, high levels of inequality seem to reduce subsequent growth. 3 Helping to explain these ndings, more subtle theories have explored precise mechanisms whereby inequality might adversely affect growth. Financial market imperfections are often at the core of this line of thought because inequalities persist because of these imperfections. 4 For example, in the model of Galor and Zeira (1993), it is because of nan cial mar ket fri cti o ns tha t poo r peo p l e cann o t in v est in th e ir education despite their high marginal productivity of investment. In Banerjee and Newman's model (1993), individuals' occupational choices are limited by their initial endowments. The structure of occupational choices\u2014whether people can become entrepreneurs or have to remain wage earners\u2014in turn determines how much they can save and what risks they can bear, with long-run implications for growth and income distribution. 5 Hence, these models show that lack of access to nance can be the critical mechanism for generating persistent income inequality or poverty traps, as well as lower growth. One implication of these modern development theories is that redis- tribution of wealth can foster growth. Indeed, this has been the main policy conclusion drawn by many readers of these theories. This think-ing rationalizes a focus on redistributive public policies such as land or education reform. However, if it is the capital market imperfections that lead to these relationships and necessitate redistribution, why neglect policies that might remove capital market imperfections? Nevertheless, some theories take credit constraints or other frictions as exogenous. In others, static information and transaction costs endogenously yield adverse selection and moral hazard frictions that impede the operation of nancial markets. In either case, researchers take capital market imperfections as given and suggest different redistributive policies to promote growth, focusing on schooling, saving, or fertility changes. This is true even though the literature also notes that if nancial market Modern development theory highlights the role of nance Wealth redistribution and nancial development PM25ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT imperfections continue to exist, absence of a virtuous circle a la Kuznets may also necessitate permanent redistribution policies.6 A more effective and sustainable development approach would directly address nancial market imperfections, without causing adverse incen- tive effects. Most redistributive policies create disincentives to work and save, although the economic magnitudes of these disincentive effects are a subject of intense debate (Aghion and Bolton 1997). As Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine (2007) argue, these tensions vanish when focusing on nancial sector reforms. Reducing nancial market imperfections to expand individual opportunities creates positive, not negative, incen-tive effects. Hence these arguments are very consistent with modern development theories yet emphasize putting nancial sector reforms that promote nancial inclusion at the core of the development agenda. Addressing nancial sector imperfections can also appeal to a wider range of philosophical perspectives than can redistributive policies inasmuch as the latter are directly linked with equalizing outcomes , whereas better functioning nancial systems serve to equalize opportunities . Extensive empirical evidence suggests a signi cant and robust relation- ship between nancial depth and growth. More recent micro evidence using rm-level data sets suggests that better-developed nancial systems ease nancial constraints facing rms. This nding illuminates one mechanism through which nancial development infl uences economic growth. Furthermore, researchers recently have shown that nancial depth reduces income inequality and poverty and is thus particularly bene cial for the poor. 7 This evidence is reviewed in detail in the com- ing chapters. Although these results are encouraging, the link between theoretical models and empirical evidence has not been very close because of a lack of data on access to nancial services. While theory focuses on the importance of broader access and greater opportunities (that is, nancial inclusion), relatively little empirical evidence links access to nance to development outcomes, and there is little guidance for policies on how best to promote access. Financial depth, or development more generally, can have direct and indirect effects on small rms and poor households. Greater depth is likely to be associated with greater access for both rms and households, which will make them better able to take advantage of investment oppor-tunities, smooth their consumption, and insure themselves. However, even if nancial development does not improve direct access for small rms or poor households, its indirect effects may also be signi cant. Financial sector reforms can improve incentive structures Empirical evidence on nancial access is limited FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 25 10/26/07 12:30:07 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 26For example, the poor may bene t from having jobs and higher wages, as better-developed nancial systems improve the ef ciency of product and labor markets and promote growth. Similarly, small rms may see their business opportunities expand with nancial development, even if the nancial sector still mostly serves the large rms. Only now are many questions about access beginning to be answered. Just how limited is nancial access around the world? What are the chief obstacles and policy barriers to broader access? How important is access to nance as a constraint to growth or poverty alleviation? Which matters more: access by households, or access by rms? Is it more important to improve the quality and range of services available to those rms and households who might already have access (intensive margin), or to provide basic services to those who are completely excluded (extensive margin)? How important is direct access to nance for the poor and small rms compared with economywide spillover effects of greater nancial development through more ef cient product and labor markets? The development of indicators of access to nancial services is the rst step in answering all these questions. Before we can improve access, or decide whether and how to do it, we need to measure it. Measurement: Indicators of Access to Finance The nancial sector is often thought of as being particularly well documented by statistical data. In advanced securities markets, data on transactions and prices are often available on a minute-by-minute basis. Across countries, indicators of the depth of banking systems, capital markets, and insurance sectors are widely available. Indicators such as the total value of bank claims on an economy's private sector expressed relative to gross domestic product, the turnover of shares (relative to total stock market capitalization), and the spread between lending and deposit interest rates have become standard measures of nancial sector develop- ment. These indicators are also the basis for a large literature assessing the impact of nancial depth and ef ciency on outcomes in the real sector, such as per capita GDP growth, and exploring the determinants of nancial sector development. Much less is known about how inclusive nancial systems are and who has access to which nancial services. How many borrowers are behind the total value of outstanding loans of a country's banking system? How Before access can be improved, it has to be measured FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 26 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 26 10/26/07 12:30:08 PM 10/26/07 12:30:08 PM27ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT many depositors are represented by the statistic on total deposits? Or taking the perspective from the demand side, what share of the popula-tion uses deposit accounts? What share of the population has taken out a loan? Unlike data on nancial depth, these statistics are not readily available. Until recently, there has been little systematic information on who is served by the nancial sector in developing countries, which nancial institutions or services are the most effective at supporting access for poor households and small enterprises, or what practical and policy barriers there may be to the expansion of access. Better data are needed to advance research on nancial inclusion, and signi cant efforts have recently been made in this direction. Unlike measures of nancial depth\u2014where data from individual institutions (or trades in the case of the capital market) can be aggregated relatively simply to obtain consolidated gures 8\u2014 data on nancial use cannot easily be constructed in this way. For instance, the total number of all bank accounts far exceeds the number of customers served, as house-holds and enterprises may have business with several banks (or multiple accounts with a single bank). Further, regulatory entities traditionally do not collect data on individual accounts or account holders (unless they are large ones), because this information has not been considered useful for macroeconomic stability analysis. Researchers have therefore used a variety of different data sources and methodologies to infer the actual share of households or enterprises that use nancial services. Many of these data collection efforts are recent, and researchers have just started to relate them to real sector outcomes. As more data become available and more systematic data collection efforts get under way, one can expect more and better analysis. Financial inclusion, or broad access to nancial services, is de ned here as an absence of price or nonprice barriers in the use of nancial services. Of course this does not mean that all households and rms should be able to borrow unlimited amounts at prime lending rates or transmit funds across the world instantaneously for a fraction of 1 percent of the amount. Even if service providers are keenly competitive and employ the best nancial technology, prices and interest rates charged and the size of loans and insurance coverage on offer in a market economy will necessarily depend on the creditworthiness of the customer. As discussed in later chapters of this report, subsidies and regulation can infl uence this outcome to some extent. But the application of modern techniques in information and communications technology is more important in improving the prices, Aggregate data can be misleading What does access mean? FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 27 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 28terms, and conditions on which nancial services are available\u2014regardless of whether services are provided at home or abroad. Improving access, then, means improving the degree to which nan- cial services are available to all at a fair price. It is easier to measure the use of nancial services since use can be observed, but use is not always the same as access. Access essentially refers to the supply of services, whereas use is determined by demand as well as supply. To illustrate the differences between access and use, remember that even wealthy customers in advanced nancial systems will choose not to use some nancial services. Some moderately prosperous customers, especially older individuals or households, may not have any wish to borrow money, even if offered a loan at a favorable interest rate. Still, almost all households need to use some nancial services, such as pay- ments services, to participate in a modern market economy, and in a few of the most advanced economies, use of at least some basic services from the formal nancial sector is essentially universal. Moreover, some speci c nancial products are not attractive to some customers on ethical or religious grounds; nonusage in this case cannot be attributed to lack of access\u2014although access might be an issue here if acceptable alternatives are not being offered. The case of Sharia - compliant nancial products can be relevant here, a topic that is discussed in chapter 4. For speci c classes of nancial services, the distinction between access and use can be signi cant (box 1.1). The challenge is to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary exclusion and, among those that are excluded involuntarily, between those that are rejected due to high risk or poor project quality and those that are rejected because of dis-crimination or high prices, which makes nancial services or products unaffordable. While rejection due to high risk and poor project quality is not necessarily worrisome, rejection due to discrimination and high prices is, particularly if equilibrium prices are too high, excluding large portions of the population. In addition, even if the underlying cost structures are the same in different countries, a given price would lead to greater exclusion in poorer countries. Poor people could be involuntarily excluded due to lack of appropri- ate products or services; they may need simple transaction accounts rather than checking accounts that entail the risk of incurring severe overdraft charges when the timing of payments and receipts goes wrong. Microentrepreneurs might be reluctant to take out loans that require Distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary exclusion FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 28 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 28 10/26/07 12:30:09 PM 10/26/07 12:30:09 PM29ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT WHAT DISTINGUISHES USE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES from access to nancial services? To what extent is lack of use a problem? The gure below illustrates the difference between access to and use of nancial ser- vices.a Users of nancial services can be distinguished from nonusers, and there are important distinctions among nonusers. On the one hand are those who do not use nancial services for cultural or religious reasons or because they do not see any need. These non users incl ude households who prefer to deal in cash and enterprises without any promising invest-ment projects. These nonusers have access, but they choose not to use nancial services. From a policy maker's viewpoint, nonusers do not really constitute a problem because their lack of demand drives their nonuse of nancial services. On the other hand are the involuntarily excluded who, despite demanding nancial services, do not have access to them. There are several different groups among the involuntarily excluded. First, there is a group of households and enterprises that are considered unbankable by com-mercial nancial institutions and markets because they do not have enough income or present too high a lending risk. Second, there might be discrimination against certain population groups based on social, religious, or ethnic grounds ( red-lining ). Third, the contractual and informational framework might prevent nancial institutions from reaching out to certain population groups because the outreach is too costly to be commercially viable. Finally, the price of nancial services may be too high or the product fea- tures might not be appropriate for certain population groups. While the rst group of involuntarily excluded cannot be a target of nancial sector policy, the other three groups demand different responses from policy makers\u2014a topic that is discussed in chapter 4.Box 1.1 Access to nance vs. use: voluntary and involuntary exclusion Users of formal financial services Voluntary self-exclusion Involuntary exclusionNo need Cultural / religious reasons not to use / indirect access Insufficient income / high risk Discrimination Contractual / informational framework Price / product featuresPopulation Non-users of formal financial services Access to financial servicesNo access to financial servicesDistinguishing between access to nance and use a. For alternative classi cations of the reasons for exclusion, see Claessens (2006) and Kempson and others (2000). 10/26/07 12:30:10 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 30them to pledge their personal assets as collateral, a common practice in most developing countries. In contrast, voluntary exclusion could resul t fro m lack o f awaren ess o f p rod ucts if nancial institutions do not target their marketing toward certain groups. Also, individuals can access services indirectly, for example, by using an account that belongs t o so m ebod y else in th e h o useh o l d. An d nally voluntary exclusion could also result from lack of nancial literacy. De ning the \"access problem\" is challenging (box 1.2). It also requires a wealth of different data sources that researchers are just starting to collect. In the remain-der of this chapter, we discuss some of these initial efforts and point to ongoing and future work. Recent data compilation efforts have made progress toward better measurement of both access to and use of nancial services. Consider rst the measurement of the use of nancial services. Ideally, one would like to have census data on the number and characteristics of households that have a bank account or an account with a bank-like nancial institution. In the absence of census data, one would at least like to have survey-based measures that are representative of the whole population and of important subgroups, again collecting information about the types of nancial services they are consuming, in what quantities, and at what price, as well as complementary data on other characteristics of the household that might affect or be affected by their nancial service use. To date, however, survey-based data are quite limited both in terms of the number of countries that are covered and the amount of informa-tion collected about the respondents. The data are often not comparable across countries because the surveys use different de nitions. Only a handful of the large and long-established Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) surveys sponsored by the World Bank cover nancial services, and even these provide limited nancial information. However, a number of specialized household surveys designed to assess nancial access have been conducted in developing countries. Among these are surveys prepared by or for the World Bank in India, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (box 1.3), though even these are not always representative of the whole country and are not consistent across different countries. An ambitious multicountry effort to measure access of individuals to a wide range of nancial services was launched by Finmark Trust in South Africa and four neighboring countries in 2002 and has since been rolled out to several other African countries. Some data come as incidental by-products of surveys designed for other purposes; this is the case for the Measuring access to, and use of, nancial services Research is hampered by limited survey data\u2014 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 30 TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT WHY DOES ONE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT AN ACCESS problem in credit markets but not about an access problem, say, for toothpaste? One of the basic rules of economics is that prices adjust so that at market equilibrium, supply equals demand. Hence, if demand for toothpaste exceeds the supply for it, the price of toothpaste will rise until demand and supply are equated at the new equilibrium price. If this price is too high for some, they will not use toothpaste. But all who are willing to pay the price will be able to use it. So if prices do their job, there should be no access problem. In a famous paper, Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) pro- vide a compelling explanation for why credit markets are different. a They show that information problems can l ead t o credi t rati o ning ev en in eq uili b ri um. That is because banks making loans are concerned not only about the interest rate they charge on the loan but also about the riskiness of the loan. And the interest rate a bank charges may itself affect the riskiness of the pool of loans, either by attracting high-risk borrowers (adverse selection effect) or by adversely affecting the actions and incentives of borrowers (moral hazard effect). Both effects exist because even after evaluating loan applications, the banks do not have complete information on their borrowers. When the interest rate (price) affects the nature of transaction, market equilibrium may not occur where demand equals supply. The adverse selection aspect of interest rates is a consequence of different borrowers having different probabilities of repaying their loan. The expected return to the bank obviously depends on the prob-ability of repayment, so the bank would like to be able to identify borrowers who are more likely to repay. It is dif cult to identify good borrowers, which is why a bank uses a variety of screening devices, including the interest rate. Those who are willing to pay high interest rates may, on average, be worse risks; they are willing to take higher risks to gain higher returns if successful, but such high returns are generally associ- ated with a higher probability of failure, making it less likely that the loans will be repaid. As the interest rate rises, the average \"riskiness\" of those who borrow increases, possibly reducing the bank's pro ts. Similarly, as the interest rate and other terms of the contract, such as collateral requirements, change, th e beha vi o r o f th e bo rro w er is likel y t o change. Stiglitz and Weiss show that higher interest rates lead to moral hazard, that is, they induce rms to undertake riskier projects with lower probability of success but higher payoffs when successful. In a world with imperfect and costly information that leads to adverse selection and moral hazard problems, the expected rate of return to the bank will increase less rapidly than the interest rate and, beyond a point, may actually decrease, as shown in gure A. The interest rate at which the expected return to the bank is maximized, r*, is the \"bank- optimal\" rate. The bank will not want to raise the interest rate above this rate, even though demand may still exceed the funds available for lending. This also suggests that the supply of loans will be backward-bending, at interest rates above r*.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 32Clearly, it is conceivable that at r*, the demand for funds ( D*) exceeds the supply of funds ( S*) as shown in gure B. In the absence of rationing, with excess demand for loans, unsatis ed borrowers would offer to pay a higher interest rate to the bank, bidding up the interest rate until demand equals sup-ply at r M. Although supply does not equal demand at rate r*, it is the equilibrium interest rate. Since it is not pro table to raise the interest rate when the bank faces excess demand for credit, the bank will deny loans to borrowers who are observationally indistinguishable from those who receive loans. The rejected applicants would not receive a loan even if they offered to pay a higher rate. Hence they are denied access. Determining empirically whether an individual or rm has access to nance but chose not to use it or was rationed out is complex, and the effects of adverse selection and moral hazard are dif cult to separate (see chapter 3). What about other financial services, such as deposit or payment services, which do not suffer from information problems? Why do these areas of nance suffer from access problems? For those types of nancial services, nonprice barriers become important. For example, some individuals will have no access to nancial services because there are no nancial institutions in their area, as is the case in many remote rural areas. Or the small transactions the poor demand may involve high xed transaction costs, which makes them too costly to be offered: it costs as much for the bank to accept a $1 deposit as it does to accept a $1,000 deposit. Poorly designed regulatory requirements may also exclude those who do not meet the documentation requirements of open-ing an account, such as not having a formal address or formal sector employment. Some would-be customers may be discriminated against for some reason. For all those individuals the supply curve is vertical at the origin, and the supply and demand for services do not intersect, again leading to an access problem (as shown by S 0 in gure C). Of course, credit markets can also suffer from these nonprice barriers in addition to the type of rationing discussed above. Price can also be a barrier. Even when nonprice barriers are overcome and the supply ( S\u00b4) and demand do intersect, the equilibrium price for these services (including the fees, minimum requirements, and so forth) may be very high, making them unaf-fordable for a large proportion of the population. This is an access problem of a different nature Box 1.2 (continued) r* S* D*D LrMr SFigure B Note: D r = interest rate.rS SS0 rFigure C Note: D = demand, S = supply; r = interest rate.

Findings based on surveys of individuals cannot easily be compared directly with those from surveys of households. 10 Different survey methodologies and their impact on the quality of information gathered are the subjects of an ongoing research effort at the World Bank. Thus, despite some interesting insights from individual household surveys that focus on nancial services, lack of cross-country compara- bility between survey instruments still prevents documentation of cross-country differences and thus analyses of supply and demand constraints. Altogether, household or individual survey data providing substantial nancial services information currently exist for fewer than 40 develop- ing countries and are inconsistent across countries in representativeness, measurement, and de nition of nancial services and products. 11 Lack of consistent cross-country, micro data on use of nancial services has led researchers to consider the information contained in more easily collected indicators such as the number of loan or deposit accounts in a country. Of course the total number of accounts is not the total number of users: people might have several accounts with one institution or accounts with several institutions. Further, a number of accounts might be dormant, a parti cular l y co mm o n occurr e n ce in man y postal sa vings b anks wi th since there is no rationing, but it still represents a policy problem because the high price often refl ects lack of competition or underdeveloped physical or institutional infrastructures, leading to nancial exclusion. These are matters that may call for public policy interventions to increase competition among providers and build relevant institutional and physical infrastructures, hence shifting the supply curve to the right ( S), reducing prices, and making nancial services affordable for a larger part of the population. These government policies are discussed in chapter 4.Box 1.2 (continued) a.

Nevertheless, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007b) and Honohan (2006) show that nonlinear combinations of such aggregate indicators of loan and deposit accounts are suf ciently highly correlated with the actual proportion of households using nancial services in coun- tries for which this information is available from household surveys.EXISTING HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS FOCUSING ON nancial services in India, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico give some insights into the information that can be o b tain ed fro m su ch surv ey instru -ments beyond simple measures of use of nancial services. Indeed, household surveys are necessary to obtain detailed information on who uses which nancial services from which types of institutions, including informal ones. These surveys include questions on why people do not use nancial ser-vices, which help researchers distinguish between use and access issues and between demand and supply factors. For example, in the United States, 87 percent of the adult population has a bank account, compared with 48 percent in rural Upper Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, India; 43 percent in 11 urban areas in Brazil; 41 percent in Bogota, Colombia; and 25 percent in Mexico City (48 percent when compulsory savings for borrowers are included). A comparison of U.S. and Mexican households reveals interesting differences about why some do not have bank accounts: Box 1.3 Measuring access through household surveys Although these gures are not strictly comparable because multiple reasons were allowed in the U.S. survey but not in the Mexican one, voluntary exclu-sion reasons\u2014such as no need or an unwillingness t o use banks\u2014ap pear t o be m u ch high er in th e United States compared with Mexico City.

These g- ures also indicate that supply factors in Mexico play a more important role in limiting access. Sources: Caskey, Ruiz Duran, and Solo (2006); 10/26/07 12:30:14 PM35ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT Indeed, in the absence of micro data that are more accurate but costly to collect, combining these indicators allows estimates to be made of the share of the population with accounts at formal or semiformal nancial intermediaries for most countries (box 1.4). Figure 1.1 maps the main cross-country variations in this synthetic \"headline\" indicator. More than 80 percent of households in most of Western Europe and North America have an account with a nancial institution, while the share is below 20 percent in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Russian Federation and many other countries of the former Soviet Union show usage ratios between 60 and 80 percent, a legacy of the state-run savings bank from communist time. Latin America exhibits a high variation in usage, ranging from less than 20 percent in Nicaragua to more than 60 percent in Chile. Usage across Asian countries varies much less and is mostly in the 40 to 60 percent range. These headline indicators show that access to nance or, more precisely, use of nancial services is positively, but not very closely, cor- related with economic development and nancial depth. Take rst the correlation with economic development. The proportion of households with an account in a nancial institution is higher in more developed Figure 1.1 Fraction of households with an account in a nancial institution Sources: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, 20 20-40 40-60 60-80 > 80Fraction of HouseholdsCreating synthetic headline indicators from surveys and aggregate data FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 35 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 35 10/26/07 12:30:15 PM 10/26/07 12:30:15 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 36AN EXACT STATISTIC ON THE NUMBER OF households that use formal nancial services can be inferred only from household surveys. However, only around 34 countries have household surveys containing this information, and researchers have therefore turned to proxy indicators to estimate the share of the population using nancial services (For estimates by country, see appendix table A.1). Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007b) compile loan and deposit account data through surveys of bank regulators for a cross-sec-tion of countries and document the large variation in these indicators across countries (see appendix table A.2). In Austria there are three deposit accounts for every inhabitant; in Madagascar, there are only 14 for every 1,000 inhabitants. In Greece there is almost one loan account for every inhabitant; in Albania, there are just four for every 1,000 inhabitants. The ratio of deposit and loan accounts per capita increases with income, although the average deposit or loan account balance relative to income per capita decreases with income, indicating that poor people and smaller enterprises are better able to make use of these services in more developed countries ( gures A and B). Still there is great variation among develop-ing countries. For example in Bolivia, the average loan amount is 28 times GDP per capita, while it is only a third of GDP per capita in Poland. In Madagascar, the average deposit account balance is nine times GDP per capita, while it is only 4 percent of GDP per capita in Iran. These aggregate indicators are not only inter- esting measures in their own right, but when no household surveys are available, they also can be used to predict the proportion of households using bank accounts. Regressing the share of households with deposit accounts obtained from household surveys on their aggregate indicators of deposit accounts and branch penetration, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007b) show that the predicted share of households with deposit accounts resulting from this regression provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the actual share of households with deposit accounts obtained from household surveys Box 1.4 Households' use of nancial services: estimating the headline indicator 2,000 1,5001,000Number of loans or deposits per 1,000 people500 0 12345 Median number of deposits Median number of loansFigure A.

Hence it is also possible to obtain from aggregate indicators out-of-sample estimates of the proportion of households using a bank account, although the t is likely to be poorer. In parallel efforts, Christen, Jayadeva, and Rosenberg (2004) collected information on indi-vidual institutions that are considered socially oriented or alternative nancial institutions, that is, institutions that target low-income clients and are not pro t maximizers, such as micro nance institutions, postal savings banks, credit unions, and state-owned agricultural and development banks, while Peachey and Roe (2006) collected information on the member institutions of the World Savings Bank Association. These different efforts give a first indication of nancial services provided by different providers. Honohan (2006) combines data from all three sources to estimate a headline indicator of access. Using data on number of accounts in nancial institutions as a proportion of population and an average account size as a proportion of GDP per capita (or estimated values where they do not exist) as regressors, he estimates a nonlinear regression relationship between these vari-ables and the actual share of households with a nan- cial account obtained from survey data. Where there is no survey data, a \"predicted\" share of households is obtained using the regressors and regression coef- cients. Hence, the headline indicator pieces together the values of households using nancial accounts from surveys when available, and this predicted value when survey data are not available. This indicator can then be used to map the share of the adult population with use of nancial accounts for most of the world, as illustrated by the map in gure 1.1.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 38countries, approaching 100 percent for some of the richest ( gure 1.2). Use of nancial services increases steeply as per capita GDP approaches $10,000, and converges to near universal use at income levels above $20,000. However, countries show signi cant differences at similar levels of economic development. On the one hand, countries in Western Europe have typically higher rates of usage than does the United Kingdom or the United States, despite similar levels of GDP per capita. On the other hand, a high er p ro po rtio n o f h o useh o lds h o lds acco un ts in nancial institutions in low-income countries in South Asia than in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, indicators of nancial use show a positive but imperfect correlation with indicators of nancial depth, such as credit to the private sector divided by GDP ( gure 1.3). This correlation shows that access really is a distinct dimension: nancial systems can become deep with- out delivering access to all. Take Colombia and Lithuania as examples. Both countries have similar levels of private credit to GDP at around 20 percent, but 70 percent of households in Lithuania have accounts, compared with 40 percent in Colombia. Similarly, over 85 percent of Figure 1.2 Economic development and use of nancial services Sources: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Honohan (2006); World Bank (2002, World Development Indicators ).100 80 60 40 20 0 0 10,000 20,000 GDP per capita (2000 $)30,000 40,000 50,000% of households using financial servicesThe correlation between nancial access and economic development is weak, albeit positive FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 38 FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 38 10/26/07 12:30:17 PM 10/26/07 12:30:17 PM39ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT households have accounts in Estonia and Switzerland, but while Estonia's nancial depth is around 20 percent, Switzerland's is over 160 percent. The positive but imperfect correlations of nancial services usage with economic development and nancial depth raise questions regarding the drivers of cross-country differences in nancial use and access. The correlations also suggest that there might be room for policy reforms to increase the level of nancial inclusion\u2014an issue that is addressed throughout this report. It is important to understand not only the actual use of nancial services, but also access across its different dimensions. Collecting indi-cators of and barriers to access and comparing them to usage and other country characteristics will enable researchers and policy makers to better understand the reasons for low access and to design policies to close the gaps (box 1.5). It is also important to assess the quality of access as well as quantity. For example, services may be available but may not be custom-ized to different needs, or points of delivery may be too few, or delivery may take a very long time. The following discusses several dimensions of access and the indicators that have been collected to proxy for them. Figure 1.3 Financial depth vs. use Sources: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2000).200 180160140120100 80604020 0 02 0 4 0 % of households using financial services60 80Colombia LithuaniaEstonia 100Private credit/GDPSwitzerlandUnited States 12:30:18 PM 10/26/07 12:30:18 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 40Consider rst geographic access. Branches have been the traditional bank outlet. Hence geographic distance to the nearest branch, or the density of branches relative to the population, can provide a rst crude in di ca ti o n o f geo grap hi c access o r lack o f p h ys i cal b arri e rs t o access (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria 2007b). As in the case of usage, geo grap hi c access vari es gr eatly across countries. Low-income Ethiopia has fewer than one branch per 100,000 people, while Spain has nearly one for every 1,000 people. Similarly, Spain has 79 branches for every 1,000 square kilometers, while sparsely populated Botswana has one branch for every 10,000 square kilometers. ATM penetration, rather than branch penetration, shows an even wider dispersion in geographic access ( gure 1.4). These indicators are only crude proxies for geographic access, however, since branches and ATMs are never distributed equally across a country but are clustered in cities and some large towns. A better measure would be the average distance from the FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THE informal and the formal sector by banks, postal savings banks, credit unions, nance companies, micro nance institutions, and a whole range of other formal and quasi-formal nonbank institutions. Given the dearth of data on access, however, the initial data collection effort has focused on com-mercial banks, which are the dominant institutions in the formal nancial sector. (Furthermore, policy implications regarding improving access are also more relevant for the formal nancial sector given that the ability of informal nance to scale up and meet the nancing needs of a growing economy is not clear; see box 3.5 in chapter 3). Conducting a survey of up to ve large banks in each of more than 80 countries, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007a) developed indicators of access for three types of banking services\u2014deposits, loans, and payments\u2014across three dimensions\u2014physical access, affordability, and eligibility (for breakdowns by country, see appendix tables A.4-A.7).Barriers such as availability of locations, minimum account and loan balances, account fees, fees associ-ated with payments, documentation requirements, and processing times are found to vary signi cantly both across banks and across countries. Indicators of access barriers are also found to be negatively corre-lated with actual use of nancial services, con rming that these barriers can exclude individuals from using bank services. The correlations of these indicators with country characteristics also have important policy implications for broadening access. This is a rst effort in documenting access barri- ers around the world. Next steps include broadening the study's coverage of both countries and banks and documenting the barriers imposed by nonbank nancial intermediaries. Finally, urban-rural differ- ences, as well as the role of customer characteristics, such as differences in gender and age, are important areas where further work will focus. The World Bank Group plans to expand and update these indicators within the context of its Getting Finance indicators.

Nevertheless, the branch and ATM density gures are highly correlated with aggregate loan and deposit accounts per popula-tion and the synthetic headline indicator introduced above, suggesting that they do contain access-relevant information (for branch and ATM penetration by country, see appendix table A.3). A focus on branches and ATMs ignores other delivery channels that have gained importance over the past decades. Among these are non-branch outlets, such as correspondent banking agreements, where bank services are sold by non nancial corporations on behalf of the banks, and mobile branches, where trucks drive through remote areas providing nancial services at a scheduled frequency. Phone nance allows clients to do nancial transactions such as payments or even loan applications over the phone. Electronic nance (e- nance) allows clients to access services through the Internet. While correspondent bank agreements and mobile branches have helped extend geographic outreach of nancial institutions in many countries, phone and e- nance have been introduced primarily to reduce transaction costs for already existing customers and to make service delivery more effective for nancial institutions. Any of these delivery channels, however, can reduce the costs of access and thus potentially increase the use of nancial services. While no cross-country data are available on the importance of these different alternative delivery channels, a recent bank-level survey, dis-cussed in box 1.5, sheds some light on their use. Asking banks whether they accept loan applications in nonbranch bank outlets, over the phone, Figure 1.4 Branch and ATM penetration by income quintile of countries Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007b).

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 42or over the Internet, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007a) nd a large variation across countries. According to this survey, bank customers in Australia, Chile, Denmark, Greece, South Africa, and Spain can submit their loan applications in nonbranch outlets, over the phone, or over the Internet. At the other extreme, loan applicants in Armenia, Ethiopia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Uganda, and Zambia have to travel to bank headquarters or a branch to submit their loan application. While this measure is of course not the only or even the most important determinant of access, it is notable that Chile, for example, has 418 loan accounts per 1,000 people, while Thailand has only 248. Limited geographic or physical access to a bank is only one type of bar- rier that potential customers face. By limiting eligibility, documentation requirements can be another important barrier to access. For example, banks in Albania, the Czech Republic, Mozambique, Spain, and Sweden demand on average only one document to open a bank account, whereas banks in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chile, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, and Zambia require at least four documents, including an identity card or passport, recommendation letter, wage slip, and proof of domicile ( gure 1.5). Given the high degree of informality in many developing countries, only a small proportion of the popula-tion can produce these documents. Sixty percent of the population in Cameroon works in the informal sector and is thus unable to produce a wage slip. People in rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa\u201461 percent of the overall population\u2014are often unable to provide a formal proof of domicile. Limiting banking services to customers within the formal Lack of documentation can create eligibility barriers Figure 1.5 Number of documents required to open a checking account Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT economy or formal society thus automatically excludes a large share, if not the majority, of people in many low-income countries. Improvements on this dimension would not require great sophistication or cost. Perhaps even more important than barriers of physical access and documentation are barriers of affordability. Standard bank account charges seem absurdly high when related to average national per capita GDP. To open a checking (transactions) account in Cameroon, a person needs more than $700, an amount higher than the per capita GDP of the country. On average, in 10 percent of the countries sampled, an amount equal to at least 50 percent of per capita GDP is necessary to open a checking account. Likewise, the cost to the customer of maintaining these accounts varies widely as a percentage of average per capita GDP. In Uganda the gure is 30 percent, whereas customers in Bangladesh pay no annual fees. Perhaps not surprisingly, there are 229 deposit accounts for every 1,000 people in Bangladesh, but only 47 for every 1,000 people in Uganda. Obviously, much of the cross-country variation here refl ects the fact that bank charges do not vary as much across countries as income does, imposing a much greater burden on individuals in poor countries and making access more dif cult. High minimum balances to open and maintain bank accounts and high annual fees can constitute high bar-riers for large parts of the population in the developing world. Checking accounts also often come as expensive packages with costly overdraft facilities that can easily be incurred accidentally by those with low and volatile incomes, resulting in great risks. Assuming, somewhat arbitrarily, that poor people cannot afford to spend more than 2 percent of their annual income on nancial services, just the fees on checking accounts can exclude more than 50 percent of the population in some African countries such as Kenya, Malawi, and Uganda from having a bank account ( gure 1.6). 12 Payments services\u2014for paying bills and sending domestic or interna- tional money transfers\u2014are an important service for many low-income households, but again these services are too costly in many countries. For example, the cost of transferring $250 internationally\u2014a typical amount of remittance\u2014is 5-10 percent of this amount for half of the sampled countries and varies from 30 cents in Belgium to $50 in the Dominican Republic ( gure 1.7). The fees associated with ATM transactions (for a relatively small transaction of $100) are also above 40 cents in Pakistan and Nigeria, and average 10 cents across countries, while the use of ATMs is free in 50 percent of the sample countries.Affordability barriers: fees and minimum balances PM 10/26/07 12:30:20 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 44Lack of appropriate products and services for low-income households and microenterprises is another important barrier to access nancial ser- vices. Availability and affordability of consumer and mortgage loans vary quite a bit around the world. Banks in Nepal reported that the minimum amount a consumer can borrow is 12 times per capita GDP, whereas in richer countries it is possible to borrow amounts smaller than 10 percent of per capita GDP. Mortgage loans, where they exist, can also be subject to high fees and high minimums. Furthermore, it can take more than 10 days to process a credit card application in the Philippines, more than 20 Figure 1.6 Share of the population unable to afford checking account fees Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007a).South AfricaGhana 02 0 4 0 Percent60 80 100MadagascarChileCameroonNepalSwazilandKenyaSierra LeoneUgandaMalawi Figure 1.7 Cost of transferring funds abroad as a percentage of $250 Source: FFA_021-054_ch01.indd 44 10/26/07 12:30:21 PM 10/26/07 12:30:21 PM45ACCESS TO FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND MEASUREMENT days to process a consumer loan application in Pakistan, and more than two months to process a mortgage loan application in Chile. Surveys of rms over the past 10 years have greatly expanded the information available about nancing patterns of and access constraints on small rms and even microenterprises across countries. These sources include the Regional Program on Enterprise Development (RPED) studies for Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s; Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) for the transition economies; the World Business Environment Survey (WBES), conducted across 80 countries in 1999-2000; and the Investment Climate Surveys (ICS), conducted since 2002 and available for almost 100 countries. These surveys include micro-, small, and medium enterprises that are not cap-tured in data sets based on published nancial statements. In addition to speci c rm information, these surveys contain an array of questions on the business environment in which the rm operates, information that allows in-depth analysis of the relationships between rm invest- ment, productivity, growth, and nancial and institutional obstacles. Doubts have been raised about how well these surveys actually represent the population of rms for a speci c country, a concern that could be fully allayed only by using census data, which are unavailable for most developing countries. Even census data that are available mostly cover only formal sector rms, representing, in many developing countries, a small fraction of the total number of rms, formal and informal. 13 These surveys ask rm managers to what extent access to and cost of external nance constitute obstacles to their operation and growth, with higher numbers indicating higher obstacles. In general, small rms in both the WBES and ICS report nancing constraints to be among the most important business constraints they face ( gure 1.8). The geographic varia- tion is large. Firms in East Asian and European countries rate nancing as a minor constraint on average, while in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, nancing constraints are much more severe. Variation is also wide within regions, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. For example, the average Chilean rm reports that neither access to nance nor its cost are important constraints to growth, whereas the average Brazilian rm reports both as important growth constraints. These surveys show that more than 40 percent of large rms, but just over 20 percent of small rms, use external nance for new investment ( gure 1.9). While large rms nance about 30 percent of their new invest- ment by external nance, small rms only nance 15 percent externally.

For example, some rms in East Asia nance almost 60 percent of their new investments with external nance. Within regions, there are big differences here too\u2014while the average rm in the Philippines nances less than 8 percent of its new investment externally, this gure is 77 percent for the average Thai rm. Out of all nancing sources, bank nance is the most common, for rms of all sizes ( gure 1.10). Firm-level surveys suggest that the share of small rms with bank credit varies from less than 1 percent in Pakistan to almost 50 percent in Thailand. Analyzing WBES data on nancing patterns, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2008) nd that small rms and rms in countries with poor institutions use less external nance, especially bank nance. Small rms do not use disproportionately more leasing or trade nance compared with larger rms, so these nancing sources do not compensate for lower access to bank nancing by small rms. Consistent with these ndings, nancial sector assessments conducted by the World Bank also often point to the limited availability of leasing and factoring, two important nancing products for small and medium enterprises. If rms do not use bank nance, why don't they? Of the ones that have applied and have been rejected, what are the reasons? Box 1.6 provides some highlights from three of the largest countries for which Banks are the most common source of nance Figure 1.10 Sources of external nance for new investments Source: ICS, covering 71 countries. Note: Values in parentheses represent of employees.0 Banks5101520 Equity ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 48surveys have offered answers to these questions. Surveys of small rms suggest that while some rms are excluded from bank nance because of high interest rates, collateral requirements, corruption in banking, cumbersome paperwork, and the like, a large proportion simply have no demand for or good projects to nance. ALTHOUGH BANK FINANCE IS THE MOST COMMON type of external nance, a large proportion of small rms do not have a bank loan. For example, enterprise surveys of small rms suggest that only 20 percent in China, 30 percent in Russia, and 55 percent in India have a bank loan. Of those who do not have a loan, 85 percent in China, 95 percent in Russia, and 96 percent in India have not applied for one. So the rejection rates are 15, 5, and 4 percent, respectively. Do these numbers refl ect barriers to access or lack of need? Some of the rm surveys include questions that help shed light on this issue. The survey results suggest that a large proportion of small rms that do not use bank loans actually do not need external nance or have been refused a loan for basic business reasons. However, in poor contractual and informational environments, the need to rely on collateral, rather than an assessment of the quality or feasibility of the project and credit history of the rm, is an important barrier for many rms. High interest rates may refl ect lack of com- petition and infrastructure problems, in addition to other macroeconomic issues. Bank corruption is also a potential barrier deterring rms from applying for bank loans. Box 1.6 Small rms' access to nance vs. use: rm-level surveys Source: ICS. a.

For example, the responses to the surveys discussed in box 1.5 suggest that in Georgia, Nepal, and Uganda, the minimum SME loan amount is 20 times GDP per capita, casting doubt on whether banks in those countries can meet the borrowing needs of smaller rms. Similarly, fees on SME loans and the time it takes to process an SME loan application may represent barriers. For example, while it takes more than a month to process an application in Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Uruguay, the wait is less than two days in Denmark ( gure 1.11). These issues are explored in much greater detail in chapter 2. Two aggregate indicators can be created by summarizing different barriers that impede rms' and households' access to nancial services. These indicators, one for access barriers for deposit services and the other for loan services, suggest an overall impression of the country characteristics that are associated with high barriers. 14 Based on simple correlations, access barriers decline as per capita GDP rises ( gure 1.12). The quality of physical infrastructure is also n ega ti v el y associa t ed wi th access b arri e rs. S u ch r ela ti o nshi ps ar e n o t necessarily causal ones; both barriers and the country characteristics shown have common underlying structural causes. Nevertheless it is striking that indicators of competition, openness, and market orienta-tion in the overall nancial sector and economic policy are also strongly negatively correlated with access barriers at the bank level. Examples include the Heritage Foundation index of banking freedoms 15 and an index of media freedom developed by Djankov and others (2003). (Each of these has also been found to be correlated with nancial depth and economic growth.) As far as contractual and informational infrastructures are concerned, better credit registries are associated with lower access barriers, but there is no evident correlation with creditor rights, suggesting that a de cient information infrastructure may be a greater barrier to access than a de - cient contractual framework. Countries that encourage market discipline by empowering market participants (through enforcement of accurate and timely information disclosure and by not distorting risk-taking incentives) also tend to have lower barriers to accessing loan services. Government ownership of banks is associated with lower barriers on the deposit side (as is foreign ownership of banks) but with higher barriers on the loan side. Not too much should be read into these simple partial correlations. They do, however, foreshadow the characteristics that emerge again and Smaller rms tend to face greater nancial exclusion What determines access barriers for households and enterprises? 49 ALL?

Conclusions Data from nancial institutions and their regulators can contribute greatly to a better understanding of the many barriers to access and usage. Ultimately, however, researchers are interested not only in mea-suring access to nancial services and the barriers that prevent access but also in understanding the welfare impact of removing these barriers and broadening access. For this, household and rm-level surveys are necessary to distinguish between supply constraints and demand-side constraints and to determine how the removal of these different barriers would affect household welfare.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 52In evaluating the impact of broadening access, randomized eld experi- ments hold promise. These experiments, which use surveys of microenter-prises and households, introduce a random component to the assignment of nancial products, such as subsidized fees for opening accounts or random variation in the terms of loan contracts. Continuing research in this area will shed more light on how reduced barriers and improved access affect growth and household welfare. These ndings, in turn, will inform the design of policy interventions to build more inclusive nancial systems, and the efforts to narrow the access indicators to track over time. We discuss these issues in more detail in the remainder of the report. Notes 1. Conceptually, when discussing the impact of nance on growth, it is important to distinguish between two different effects (Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992) the impact of nance on raising income levels of developing coun- tries and on helping countries converge in income toward advanced economies; and the impact on steady state growth rate. The second effect could result from the role of nancial development in promoting innovation and accelerating the outward movement of the frontier. Empirically, there is very little evidence to distinguish between these two effects. However, see Aghion, Howitt, and Mayer-Foulkes (2005), discussed below. 2. A return to rising inequality in several advanced economies in the past couple of decades shows further shortcomings of the Kuznet's model. 3. Key contributors to this literature are Alesina and Rodrik (1994); Perotti (1992, 1993, 1996); Persson and Tabellini (1994); for a contrary view, see Forbes (2000). World Bank (2006a) and Birdsall (2007) also discuss the implications of this literature and provide further references. An interesting case study is that of the Republic of Korea and the Philippines, which looked quite similar with regard to their development in the early 1960s, except in the degree of income inequality. Over the following 30-year period, income per capita in the Philippines (the more unequal country) barely doubled, whereas fast growth in Korea resulted in a vefold increase. 4. There are other possible channels through which higher inequality could slow growth: for example, if inequality results in less-accountable governments or if it undermines civic and social life (compare Birdsall 2007). 5. Also see the discussion in Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine (2007) and many references therein. 6.

See Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007); Honohan (2004). 8. Of course, some netting of interinstitutional accounts is still needed.9. For a general review of issues around data collection in this area, see Honohan (2005b). 10. The focus on individuals rather than households raises issues of com- parability with other surveys: use of nancial services can differ considerably between different household members, and it would be a mistake to assume that one household member's use is representative of the access of the other members. Surveys that randomly question individuals in a household are a less-promising basis for welfare analysis, which requires good-quality data at the household level. 11. In the context of the Year of Microcredit 2005, a coordinated effort was also started by World Bank, UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and the U.K. Department for International Development to implement a consis-tent, stand-alone household survey instrument across developing countries to measure access to and use of nancial services. Currently, the Research Department of the World Bank and UNCDF are planning to move forward with this effort, which should allow consistent cross-country comparison of nance-related questions and derivation of the share of households that use different nancial services from different providers. 12. Genesis (2005a) examines the costs of using bank accounts in seven countries: Brazil, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa. According to Genesis (2005b), the 2 percent limit is based on unpublished research by the South African Universal Services Agency in the context of a mandated rolling-out of telecommunications service to lower-income families. As both nancial transaction accounts and telecom service can be considered network products, similar assumptions on affordability for both services seem reasonable. 13. Surveys are now being designed to reach informal rms also; see http:// www.enterprisesurveys.org. 14. The aggregate indicators are the principal component indicator of the underlying indicators for deposit and loan services, respectively. Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007a) use a data set of 209 banks in 62 countries and regress these aggregate indicators of barriers on bank-level controls and one country-level variable at a time, such as the quality of physical and information infrastructures, protection of creditor rights, bank and media freedoms, and government ownership of banks. 15. This index takes into account government involvement and ownership, existence of directed lending and controls, quality of regulation and supervi-sion, and the ability of foreign institutions to operate freely.

This is not just a matter of the overall volume of lending: it matters crucially which rms get nance and on what terms, that is, on whether creditworthy rms of all sizes, both incumbent ones and those that seek entry, have broad access to nance at reasonable costs. Improving access to external sources of funding is undoubtedly the main challenge for rm nance in developing countries, and that fact alone justi es the attention it receives. Naturally, it is also the area of nance that has received the most econometric research attention. Other dimensions of nance also matter, such as cash management and payments services, risk management, and insurance, and they deserve further research attention. This chapter looks at how rms nance themselves in developing countries and explores the barriers to improved contracting between rms and the providers of funds. It discusses the channels through which nance affects rm performance and the relative importance of nancing obstacles as a constraint to rm growth compared with other obstacles in the business environment. Firms nance their operations and growth in many different ways, refl ecting both the preferences of management and the options that are available to them. Availability of external nancing for rms depends on the wider institutional environment, and lack of availability is one of the more important business obstacles rms have to overcome. Better access to nance can help new rm entry and growth, which in turn promotes growth at the aggregate level. This chapter examines the impact of nancial barriers on rms\u2014 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 56The chapter documents how improvements in the functioning of the formal nancial sector can be expected to reduce nancing constraints more for small rms and others who have dif culty in self- nancing or in nding private or informal sources of funding. As a result, the effec- tiveness of nance has a signi cant impact on the ownership structure, the dynamism, and the resilience of the economy at large. Finance does not just raise aggregate rm performance uniformly but also transforms the structure of the economy by affecting different types of rms in dif- ferent ways. The removal of nancial barriers appears to be especially bene cial for small rms\u2014which embody much of an economy's latent dynamism. Removal or reduction of nancial barriers can thus broaden the sectoral range of the economy and reduce its vulnerability to sector-speci c shocks. The institutional environment can also infl uence pat- terns of ownership\u2014for example, well-functioning nancial and legal systems can lead more rms to incorporate and result in more diffuse patterns of rm ownership. Finally, the chapter examines the ability of rms, especially small rms, t o access nance from different sources, including banks and other intermediaries, securities markets, and foreign investment. Special attention within this section is given to the much discussed issue of foreign-owned banks and their contribution to improving access. The debate about whether banks or markets do a better job no longer excites much interest: each has its place in ensuring that nance reaches a wide clientele. Creating the infrastructures that let both markets and institu-tions reach their optimal level is likely to be the best policy. Relationship lending, which relies on personal interaction between borrower and lender and is based on an understanding of the borrower's business and not just on collateral or on mechanical credit scoring systems, is costly for the lender and thus requires either high spreads or large volumes to be viable. However, if the customer's creditworthiness is hard to evaluate, then there may be no alternative to relationship lending\u2014although this may lead to discrimination against certain groups. The modern trend to transactional lending\u2014whether based on assets or, for example, on automated credit appraisal using improved data\u2014is clearly the way of the future. Credit registries are an important tool for the expansion of transactions-based lending technologies. Foreign banks bring with them capital, technology, know-how, and a degree of independence from the local business elite. However, the role of foreign banks in improving access has always been controversial, partly \u2014and on economic structures in general\u2014 \u2014identi es rms' sources of nance\u2014 \u2014and considers ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY for political reasons. Foreign banks have a comparative advantage in transactional lending, which raises concerns about their contribution to credit access for countries where relationship lending is still needed. The entry of foreign banks has directly bene ted larger rms, and in many countries this improved credit access has extended directly or indirectly to smaller rms. Nevertheless there are also some indications that the arrival of foreign banks has not always been good for small rm access to credit, at least at rst. Nonbank nance remains much less important than bank nance in most developing countries, but this can be expected to change. The corporate bond market and organized securities markets are chiefl y of relevance to larger rms, although by broadening the range of rms that have access to long-term funding, these markets do make a contribu-tion to access. Foreign direct investment offers a partial substitute for local nance and is an alternative that has proved important in some countries. FDI appears to have eased nancing constraints\u2014although again the bene ts are most apparent for larger rms. Access to Finance: Determinants and Implications Firms nance their operations and growth in many different ways. Their nancing choices are infl uenced by the preferences of each rm's entrepreneurs and, more important, by the options that are available to them. In what form, from whom, how successfully, and at what cost rms are nanced thus depends on a wide range of factors both internal and external to the rm. The internal nancial resources available to the rm's entrepreneurs and other insiders are of course important. Not only are these the basis for most start-ups, but they can help leverage external nance, that is, nance from outsiders. But given information and agency problems (discussed in chapter 1, box 1.2), external nancing also depends on the rm entrepreneurs' own ability to project a credible nancing proposal, their willingness to share control, the nature of their business plan, and the uncertainties and risks involved in implementing it. The credibility of the proposal depends not only on the substance of the business plan, but on how the rm is governed and on the transpar- ency of its operations and nancial condition. Circumstances external to the rm are also important. Availability of external nancing depends not only on the rm's situation, but on the \u2014and the growth of ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 58wider policy and institutional environment supporting the enforceability and liquidity of the contracts that are involved in nancing rms. And it depends on the existence and effectiveness of a variety of intermediaries and ancillary nancial rms that help bring providers and users of funds together in the market, not least by helping overcome information and agency problems (Tirole 2006). As countries differ in their nancial contracting environments, so too the extent and pattern of rm nancing tend to differ. Most impor- tant, these background conditions affect the extent to which rms as a whole face nancing constraints in different countries (and even within countries across different states or provinces; see Laeven and Woodruff 2007). As noted in chapter 1, access to nance is among the aspects of the business environment most frequently cited by surveyed enterprises in the developing world as an important obstacle to their growth. 1 Moreover, investigations of the impact of nancing obstacles on rm growth reveal that rms' complaints are valid\u2014their growth is signi cantly constrained by lack of access. One nice piece of evidence on this comes\u2014somewhat ironically, given the policy recommenda-tions of this report\u2014from a study of a directed credit program in India. Banerjee and Dufl o (2004) studied detailed loan information on 253 small and medium-size borrowers from a bank in India both before and after they became newly eligible for the program. Speci cally, the size de nition of the program was changed in 1998, which enabled a new group of medium-size rms to obtain loans at subsidized interest rates. Naturally these rms began to borrow under this favored program, but instead of simply substituting subsidized credit for more costly nanc- ing, th ey expan d ed th e ir sal es p r o po rti o nall y t o th e ad di ti o nal l o an resources, which suggests that these rms must have previously been credit constrained. Moreover, as shown in gure 2.1, the new bene ciaries experienced signi cantly higher costs and pro ts, while there was no signi cant effect for other rms. 2 The reader should not, of course, jump to the conclusion that directed credit is the best\u2014or even a good\u2014solution to the existence of credit constraints. As discussed in chapter 4, not all such programs even reach their intended target groups or result in increased output for the eligible rms, let alone their impact on the rest of the economy. More extensive cross-country evidence comes from the responses of some 10,000 rms in 80 countries to the World Business Environment Barriers to nance are a constraint to rm growth\u2014 \u2014indeed, the major constraint to rm growth, according to surveys of managers FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 58 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 58 10/26/07 6:17:09 AM 10/26/07 6:17:09 AM59FIRMS' TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY Survey of 1999-2000. It turns out that respondents who identify nance as a constraint are more likely to experience slow output growth (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2005). 3 Among the three constraints these authors focus on\u2014corruption, legal, and nance\u2014 nancing constraints lead to the greatest reduction in rm growth ( gure 2.2). While other business environment obstacles are also important, they are Figure 2.1 Response of bene ciaries under a credit scheme Source: Based on Banerjee and Dufl o (2004).

AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 60often related to nance, and even when these interactions are controlled for as well as they can be in a cross-section, access to nance seems to emerge consistently as one of the most important and robust underly-ing factors that constrain rm growth (Ayyagari, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2006a). Both cross-country and case-study evidence thus points to the exis- tence of nancing constraints and shows how access to and use of credit can alleviate these constraints. The Channels of Impact: Micro and Macro Evidence The next issue is to identify the channels through which easier access to external nance increases rm growth and ultimately economic growth. There are numerous potential channels, and recent research shows that nance is associated with all of them. \u0081 The availability of external nance is positively associated with the number of start-ups \u2014an important indicator of entrepre- neurship\u2014as well as with rm dynamism and innovation . \u0081 Finance is also needed if existing rms are to be able to exploit growth and investment opportunities and to achieve a larger equilibrium size. \u0081 Firms can safely acquire a more ef cient productive asset port- folio where the infrastructures of nance are in place, 4 and they are also able to choose more ef cient organizational forms such as incorporation. To get a fl avor of the nature of the empirical evidence researchers use in detecting these effects, look, for example, at the evidence on start-ups and their subsequent growth. Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan (2006) extracted data on more than 3 million rms from the Amadeus database (which assembles information mainly from national company registries in advanced and transition economies in Europe). From inspection of the reported age of each company, Klapper and her colleagues were able to compute the entry rate for each of eleven two-digit sector groups and thus assess the effect of entry and other regulations on the degree of new rm entry and rm growth. Figure 2.3 shows striking differences, even between two developed economies such as Italy and the United Kingdom, in such dimensions as the rate of rm entry (higher in the Better access to nance can promote new rm entry and growth FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 60 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 60 10/26/07 6:17:10 AM 10/26/07 6:17:10 AM61FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY United Kingdom), initial rm size at start-up (higher in Italy), and more rapid growth (higher in the United Kingdom). The econometrics shows that such differences are in part related to rm registration costs (more than six times as high in Italy as in the United Kingdom), as well as to easier access to external nance in the United Kingdom. The authors also dig deeper and test the conjecture that, within countries, entry regulations would have the greatest effect in industries that\u2014in a lightly regulated economy like that of the United States\u2014would be most likely to have a high entry rate. Indeed, this proves to be so, providing a more convincing case for the importance of avoiding unnecessarily burdensome regulation. But not all types of regulations hinder: it turns out that the kinds of regulation needed for well-functioning nance (such as accounting standards and property rights) have a positive effect on entry. 5 The wealth of information generated on a cross-country basis by the Investment Climate Surveys can be used to examine the role of nance in infl uencing a range of enterprise characteristics. For example, Ayyagari, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2007a) exploited the responses of some 17 ,000 rms in 47 countries to the questions on enterprise innovation. 6 Taking an average of each rm's responses to the innova- tion-related questions, these authors assembled a range of country- and rm-level variables likely to be associated with rm innovation, including Figure 2.3 Italy vs. U.K.: rm size at entry and over time Source: Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan (2006). 1.6 1.20.8 0.4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Age of fi rm (yea rs)Value added ($ millions) United Kin gdom Italy Use of external nance is associated with more innovation by rms FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 61 61 10/26/07 6:17:10 AM 10/26/07 6:17:10 AMFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS ECONOMETRIC STUDIES PURPORTING TO EXPLAIN cross-country differences in economic growth rates and other country characteristics have proliferated in recent years. Not all of these studies have been equally convincing. Numerous published papers did not take adequate account of the formidable prob-lems of making valid inferences from such data. The most widespread problems include heterogeneity of effects across countries, measurement errors, omis-sion of relevant explanatory variables, and endoge-neity, all of which tend to bias the estimated effect of the included variables. These problems are not limited to cross-country regressions, but they seem especially prominent in this area. Of these, endo-geneity is the most intractable. It arises when the common effect of an omitted factor or disturbance on two variables is misinterpreted as a causal link between them. Econometric theory offers a number of possible solutions, but most of them call (in one way or another) for what are known as instrumental variables. These are not always available or credible, given that their validity and effectiveness depends on the instrument being correlated with the explanatory variables, but (crucially) not otherwise correlated with the dependent variable. The second criterion for validity\u2014the so-called exclusion restriction\u2014is dif cult to verify. The cross-country studies cited in this report have all made plausible efforts to deal with these problems, sometimes by painstaking collection of data on ingeniously chosen instrumental variables; indeed, the literature has relied heavily on just a handful of such instruments (compare Pande and Udry 2006). Since they cannot logically have satis- ed the exclusion restrictions required to ensure their validity for all of the applications, in at least some applications they must have been invalid. Sometimes, a more direct approach can be taken using micro data and making use of sectoral or rm- level differences. For example, instead of just looking at country aggregates, it may be plausible to assume that the effect being measured, if present at all, is stronger in some sectors, or for some types of rms, than others; in other words, some sectors or rms are more susceptible to the causal factor being examined (for example, nancial sector development). Even if the causal factor varies only across countries, its impact can then be more precisely measured if data is available at the rm or sector level. a The additional information obtained by working wi th cross-co un try rm - o r sect o r - l ev el data ma y not be as great as at rst appears, however; the dif- ferent rms in any given country are likely affected by common disturbances, which, if neglected, can result in overestimating the precision of coef cient estimates. Dropping the cross-country dimension often allows researchers to take explicit account of special circumstances and to exploit more detailed data, such as data across different states or regions of a country. The quality of the data is more likely to be uniform for observations within a single country. But omitting cross-country variation comes at the cost of narrowing the range of variation in the phe-nomena being studied\u2014indeed, some causal factors of interest may not vary at all within a country. All in all, it is through an accumulation of evidence using different methodologies that the complete picture can be progressively lled in.Box 2.1 Are cross-country regression results credible? a. Several of the papers discussed in this chapter employ this assumption, using the product of the causal variable and the sup posed sectoral or rm-level susceptibility as the explanatory variable. This approach was rst applied in the nancial access lite rature by Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) and by Rajan and Zingales (1998). Using rm-level data from 8,500 large companies in 30 countries, the former used a nancial planning model to calculate how fast those rms could be expected to grow if they ha d no access to external nance. The extent to which rms were able to grow faster than this internally nanced growth rate repres ented the rm's growth susceptibility to good nance. In countries with greater nancial depth, stock market development, and lega l enforcement, a higher proportion of rms were able to grow at rates that are possible only with access to external nance. Ra jan and Zingales worked with data on 36 sectors in 41 countries and assumed that each sector's susceptibility to nancial developm ent would be correlated across countries with the degree to which large rms in the same sector in the United States relied on ext ernal nancing. This statistical technique is also referred to as a form of \"difference-in-differences\" estimation. FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 62 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd AM63FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY information about the structure of each rm's nancing. Despite the inclusion of the other control variables and even after controlling for reverse causality by using instrumental variable techniques, they found that rms' use of external nance was associated with more innovation. This nding was even more strongly evident when access to nance was from foreign banks. The results of this rm-level, cross-country evidence are pretty unambiguous. Access to and use of nance, and the institutional underpinnings that are associated with better nancial access, favorably affect rm performance along a number of different channels. If entry, growth, innovation, equilibrium size, and risk reduction are all helped by access to and use of nance, it is almost inescapable that aggregate economic performance will also be improved by having stronger nan- cial systems. Indeed, this result is likely a glimpse of the main underlying mecha- nism behind the now relatively long-established nding that a signi cant fraction of the differences across countries in economic growth in the latter half of the 20th century can be explained by variations in their level of nancial development (Levine 2005; World Bank 2001). The nance and growth literature typically measures nancial development by the ratio of bank credit to the private sector to GDP , an inevitably crude measure that captures only two aspects of nancial development, namely, the ability of banks to mobilize resources, and the degree to which they channel these resources to the private sector. Indeed, research-ers' extensive use of this banking-depth variable to summarize nancial development occurs primarily because\u2014unlike other measures\u2014it is available for many countries over a long period of time. Among the dimensions not explicitly captured by this measure are the ability and success of banks in making good credit appraisal and monitoring deci-sions and in maintaining operational ef ciency; the measure also does not capture the operation of nonbank aspects of the nancial sector, including the market for equities. Given the imperfections of this mea-sure, it is all the more striking that such a strong statistical cross-country correlation between nancial development and growth was detected and proved robust to the application of instrumental variables to take account of endogeneity. Indeed, when the adjustment for endogeneity is made, it increases the estimated impact of nance on growth, which underscores that credit depth is only a proxy for the true degree of nancial development. 7 Broader access to nance also promotes growth at the aggregate level FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 63 63 10/26/07 6:17:12 AM 10/26/07 6:17:12 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 64Overall banking depth (not just private credit) is also correlated across countries with overall economic growth, but less robustly: it does seem that restricting attention to private credit, as opposed to all bank intermediation, is correct. Look, for example, at China (a country that is excluded from most econometric studies, not least because of the dif- culty of reliably measuring private credit, due to the ambiguity of rm ownership in the process of China's transition from the planned economy system). Interprovincial differences in growth rates in China are highly correlated with banking depth\u2014but negatively (Boyreau-Debray 2003; Boyreau-Debray and Wei 2005). Mobilizing huge amounts of funds to pour into the declining parts of the Chinese state enterprise system, as the main Chinese banks were doing during the last decades of the 20th century, does not appear, on this evidence, an effective way of employ-ing the nancial system in the interests of economic growth. China has continued to grow rapidly, as more workers shift from subsistence agriculture and other low-productivity activities into the modern sector. But the Chinese banking system, despite being one of the deepest in the world, has not been a major contributor to this growth ( gure 2.4). 8 The nance and growth link is thus better seen as one that operates by enabling privately owned rms to reach their potential.9 Likewise, the aggregate evidence on long-term growth shows that nance has its infl u- ence through productivity gains rather than simply through an increase in the vol ume o f in vestmen t (Beck, Levine, and Loayza 2000; Love 2003); nance also plays an important role in reallocating investments across sectors as demand shifts (Wurgler 2000). 10 Banking systems can grow too quickly\u2014with the boom inevitably followed by a bust\u2014and in some countries the huge size of the bank-ing system refl ects policy distortions that are inhibiting the emergence and growth of complementary segments of nance. Perhaps therefore it is not so surprising that the econometric link between banking depth and aggregate economic growth has weakened in recent years, in par-ticular when the data set includes the 1997-98 East Asia nancial crisis (Rousseau and Wachtel 2005). There also seems to be a threshold effect at the other end of the scale: below a certain level of nancial development, small differences do not seem to help growth. 11 In these countries, nancial development may boost income but not the long-run growth rate. Indeed, Aghion, Howitt, and Mayer-Foulkes (2005) suggest that it is lack of access to nance that prevents entrepreneurs in poor countries with undeveloped nancial Rapid growth of the banking sector can be potentially destabilizing FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 64 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 64 10/26/07 6:17:12 AM 10/26/07 6:17:12 AM65FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY systems from catching up. Without access to nance at a reasonable cost, and lacking suf cient personal wealth, these entrepreneurs cannot afford to make the needed investments in innovation. The theoretical access-based model of Aghion, Howitt, and Mayer-Foulkes implies that low-income countries with low nancial development will continue to fall behind the rest, whereas those reaching the nancial development threshold will converge and, up to a certain point, will do so faster the higher the level of nancial development. Comparing average long-term economic growth rates for a cross-section of about 70 countries, they nd\u2014consistent with their theory\u2014that nancial development helps an economy converge faster but that there is no effect on steady-state growth. Summarizing, access to credit supports rm growth and ultimately national growth through a variety of different channels. Providing access to credit to the most ef cient and innovative enterprises is behind the well-documented causal relationship between nancial depth and national growth. But who bene ts the most from nancial deepening Figure 2.4 Finance and growth across Chinese provinces Source: Boyreau-Debray (2003).

What impact does nancial deepening and broadening have on the economy's structure? We turn to these questions next. Transforming the Economy: Differences in Impact Finance does not just raise aggregate rm performance uniformly; it also transforms the structure of the economy by affecting different types of rms in different ways. As already discussed, some categories of rms\u2014the small and the new, for example\u2014have more dif culty obtaining external nance than others. But as nancial access condi- tions improve in an economy, those that were formerly shut out have an TWO ASSUMPTIONS, EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT, IN much of the literature on nancial access are that availability of external nance and greater formality in nance are both improvements over internal and informal nance. The idea that availability of external nance rep- resents an improvement comes from two rather dif-ferent perspectives. First is the idea that a latent pool of enterprise and innovation exists in an economy that, absent external nance, can be made effective only if the entrepreneurs happen to begin with suf- cient wealth either themselves or through associates (Rajan and Zingales 2003). Second (and in a sense the opposite problem) is the question of agency: a rm that generates too much free cash may nd its insiders making poor investments and relaxing cost control efforts (Jensen 1988; Stulz 1990). If that happens in enough rms in a rapidly growing and pro table enterprise sector, excess free cash could actually weaken the growth process compared with a situation where the enterprise sector has to rely more on external nance provided by an ef cient and competitive nancial system. The contemporary case of pro table state-owned companies in China provides an interesting case for this last point, as discussed by Kuijs (2005). The argument that informal nancial systems may substitute for formal nancial systems has been canvassed for the case of China by Allen, Qian, and Qian (2005, 2008). But their story takes as given obstacles to formal nancial development such as restrictions on entry and pervasive state owner-shi p o f banks. E v en if info rmal nance works in such conditions, it is just a second-best solution. Besides, informal sources of nance vary widely in their effectiveness. Ayyagari, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2007b) provide evidence from China that, on average for the rms in their sample, access t o fo rmal nan ce was associated wi th faster rm growth. More generally, informality and relation-ship lending survive where the institutions needed to support modern technologies of credit appraisal and monitoring are not present. Box 2.2 External vs. internal and formal vs. informal nance FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 66 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY opportunity to expand. In this way , nancial sector development has consequences for the composition and performance of the enterprise sector in terms both of size and of ownership. The size distribution of rms can be affected by the availability of external nance: nancial development aids entry of small rms much more than that of large ones, but small rms usually struggle more to get nance when the environment is weak. 12 The size and success of sectors in which small rms have a natural advantage, or those in which rms gen- erally rely more on external nance (including export-oriented rms),13 are also particularly dependent on nancial sector development. Not only do small rms report higher nancing obstacles than do large rms; they are also more severely affected when they encounter these obstacles. Survey ndings suggest that nancing obstacles loom much more for small rms than for large rms ( gure 2.5). Speci cally, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2005) nd that nancing constraints reduce rm growth by 6 percentage points, on average, for large rms but by 10 percentage rms in the case of small rms. This difference between small and large rms is as big or even bigger for some of the speci c nancing obstacles reported in the World Business Environment Survey, such as collateral requirements, bank paperwork, Lowering nancial barriers is especially bene cial for small rms\u2014 Figure 2.5 The effect of nancing constraints on growth: small vs. large rms Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2005).

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 68interest rate payments, the need for special connections, and banks' lack of lending resources. In addition, the lack of access to speci c forms of nancing such as export, leasing, and long-term nance is signi - cantly more constraining for small rms (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2005). To the extent that small rms embody much of an economy's latent dynamism, a weaker nancial system, by constraining such rms, may condemn a country to a much slower growth path. More generally, the economy as a whole may lose out on the potential for wealth creation in sectors that might give the economy a comparative advantage were it not for the sector's dif culty in accessing needed nancial services. 14 With a narrower range of healthy sectors, the economy's resilience to sector-speci c shocks is also likely to be weakened. While lack of nancial access tends to hurt small rms the most in countries with underlying weaknesses in their institutional environment, empirical evidence also suggests that small rms bene t disproportion- ately\u2014in terms of seeing their constraints relaxed\u2014as nancial systems develop (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2005; Beck and others 2005). Hence it is those who were previously constrained\u2014not those who were already getting nance\u2014that bene t most from nancial d ev el o p m e n t. This eff ect also sh o ws u p wh e n stu d ying e p isod es o f nancial liberalization. Laeven (2003) shows that small rms' nancing constraints decrease following nancial liberalization (including inter- est rate liberalization, elimination of credit controls, privatization, and foreign bank entry), while large rms' nancing constraints actually increase (perhaps refl ecting the loss of preferential access to nance by large and politically well-connected rms). Perhaps even more important, ownership patterns depend on nancial sector development, both because rm entrepreneurs choose ownership structures in large part to ensure adequate nancing, and because nance tends to go to rms with conducive ownership structures\u2014the selection effect. Speci cally, background conditions in the nancial sector infl u- ence the degree to which the producing rms choose to incorporate or remain controlled by a closed group of family members. For example, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Love, and Maksimovic (2006) use survey data from 52 developed and developing countries to investigate the drivers of the decision to incorporate and the gains for the enterprise from incorporation They nd that rms are more likely to incorporate \u2014which in turn can widen an economy's sectoral range and dynamism Financial development infl uences ownership 6:17:14 AM69FIRMS' ACCESS TO ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY in countries with better-developed nancial and legal systems, strong creditor and shareholder rights, and effective bankruptcy processes. While incorporated rms do not necessarily report lower nancial barriers to their operation and growth in an average country, nancial and institutional development does seem to lower obstacles more for incorporated than unincorporated rms. Similarly, incorporated rms grow faster than unincorporated rms only in countries with higher levels of institutional development. These results suggest that the costs and bene ts of the legal form of enterprises is endogenous to a country's institutions: incorporated rms have a comparative advantage in countries with institutions that support formal contracting, while unincorporated rms are more adapted to operate in countries with less-developed formal institutions where rms have to rely on informal institutions and reputation. The institutional environment can also affect other dimensions of ownership. Family rms, even large ones, are still remarkably common, as are interrelated multi rm business groups. Ownership concentration is prevalent in countries with weak minority shareholder rights, suggest-ing that the inability to share control and pro ts with nonmanagement shareholders might very well result in limiting the opportunities for raising external equity (La Porta, Lopez-Silanes, and Shleifer 1999). The prevalence of interrelated business groups in many developing countries is similarly attributed to the lack of functioning nancial markets, forc- ing rms to look for alternatives in the form of internal capital markets of large business groups. Financial development and easier access to external nance thus allows incorporated, self-standing, and independent enterprises with widely spread ownership to fl ourish. This has a range of broader implications for the identity and concentration of ownership in the economy at large. For one thing, a developed nancial sector also tends to be associated with a greater degree of competition in the non nancial enterprise sector. More broadly, ownership structures in the enterprise sector can infl uence political economy performance (Rajan and Zingales 2003). Summarizing, nancial development that improves access to external nance by rms has a deep impact on the sectoral and industrial structure of an economy. What institutions and markets matter most for broader access to external nance, particularly for small rms? We address this question in the next section. Increased shareholder rights can broaden the ownership base FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 69 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 69 10/26/07 6:17:15 AM 10/26/07 6:17:15 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 70What Aspects of Financial Sector Development Matter for Access? We now examine different sources of access to nance. This section looks rst at the old \"banks versus markets\" debate, before turning to a more detailed look at the role of banks (especially foreign banks), nonbank debt markets, and equities. Other dimensions of nance, such as cash management, payments, and insurance, are not speci cally discussed, refl ecting the state of the literature. In particular, the role of domestic and foreign nancial intermediaries (including insurance rms) in help- ing to manage risk for rms in developing countries is an area deserving much more formal econometric research to add to a sizable practitioner literature. The main message of these subsections can be briefl y summarized. On the debate between banks and markets, the suggestion that one type of system is clearly better than the other no longer has much support in the literature, whether for access or for nancial sector development. Instead, creating the infrastructures that let both markets and institu-tions reach their optimal level is likely to be the best policy. Making credit from banks and other intermediaries that provide debt nance more widely accessible calls for two complementary approaches. On the one hand, the modern trend to transactional lending, whether based on assets or on automated credit appraisal such as credit registries, for example, is clearly the way of the future. On the other hand, neglect of relationship lending can mean that large parts of the market are underserved where infrastructures are weak and economic activity more informal. The role of foreign banks in improving access has always been controversial, partly for political reasons. We look in some detail at the evidence here, and conclude on balance that opening to foreign banks is likely over time to improve access for small and medium enterprises, even if the foreign banks con ne their own lending primarily to large rms and governments. The corporate bond market and organized securities markets are chiefl y of relevance to larger rms, though by broadening the range of rms that have access to long-term funding, they do make a contribution to access. Indeed, the spillover effects of greater access for large rms may be signi cant for smaller rms because they often rely on trade credit, another area that deserves more research. Opening up the equity market to foreign investors improves access for the larger rms. The market for FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 70 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 70 10/26/07 6:17:15 AM 10/26/07 6:17:15 AM71FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY private equity (including through inward foreign direct investment) can also reach medium-size rms, and its development depends on adequate shareholder protections and accounting and other information. Banks versus Markets As mentioned, much of the early econometric evidence on cross-coun- try differences used broad measures of nancial development such as banking depth. That was largely a matter of convenient availability of data, and it certainly does not imply that nonbank nance is of lesser concern. Even a deep banking sector can hinder access if it lacks compe-tition, mainly serves incumbents at high cost (something that has often been observed with state-owned banking systems), or operates without regard to prudential standards. In contrast, a liquid securities market can contribute an additional valuable dimension to nancial access (albeit mainly for larger rms). Following a vigorous debate about the relative merits of bank-domi- nated systems and those oriented to the securities market, the proponents of each seem to have fought themselves to a standstill. There are good reasons for thinking that each has its sphere of comparative advantage (Allen and Gale 2000). For instance, banks can be effective in nanc- ing ventures and rms active in sectors where there is little dispute over the sector's prospects and where rms can be relied upon to pay back loans provided they maintain cost control and productive ef ciency. Even though just a few banks may control most of the loanable funds, that need not result in exclusion of creditworthy borrowers. In contrast, where an entrepreneur seeks external nancing for a venture about whose prospects there is considerable disagreement, the securities markets can help: even if majority opinion is against the scheme, the entrepreneur can nd nancing if a suf ciently well- nanced minority of investors likes the project. But when it comes to aggregate economic growth, the research evidence shows that it does not matter for long-term economic growth whether a nancial system is primarily bank-based or market-based. What does matter is the level of overall nancial development of banks and markets (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Levine 2001; Levine 2002). The same is true at the sectoral level: there seems to be no tendency for sectors especially reliant on external nance to grow more (or less) quickly in a bank-dominated system than in a market-based system Both banks and markets have a role to play\u2014 \u2014although markets may be better at providing long-term ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 72(Beck and Levine 2002). The growth in the number of rms in the sec- tor, or in the average size of rms, is likewise insensitive to the relative size of the banking and securities sectors.15 There is a hint, however, in the results obtained by Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002), that rms' ability to obtain nancing may be affected in different ways by the two systems, especially at lower levels of nancial development. 16 While development of both banks and markets improves access to exter-nal nance, a relatively larger securities market may be associated with relatively better access of rms to long-term nancing, with banking development more associated with availability of short-term nancing. Hence differences in the contracting environments and their impact on relative development of banks versus markets may have important implications for which rms and projects have access to nance, despite our inability to observe an impact on growth using aggregate data. More recent analysis helps shed light on some of the underlying aspects of nancial sector development in broadening access. 17 Access to Debt Finance Debt nance is typically the major source of external funding for rms o f all s izes, n o ma tt e r h o w s mall .18 Diverse lending technologies are employed for reaching different types of client in contrasting environ-ments, especially where clients do not have conventional collateral or where collection of collateral is not secure. 19 Conventional practice distinguishes between transactions lending, based primarily on \"hard\" quantitative data (such as a credible set of borrower nancial accounts) or secured on assets, and relationship lending, based signi cantly on \"soft\" qualitative information. In practice, however, the menu is much broader (as Berger and Udell 2006 emphasize). Because of the time and effort involved in understanding the bor- rower's business and nancial needs, relationship lending is costly for the lender and therefore requires either high spreads or large volumes to be viable. If the customer's creditworthiness is hard to evaluate, then there may be no alternative to relationship lending. In a broad sense, relationship lending is at the core of the banking business, continu-ing to give banks a comparative advantage over markets and nonbank nancial institutions, even in developed countries (Boot and Schmeits 2005). Indeed, limited access to credit in some dif cult environments may be attributable to the reluctance of existing intermediaries to engage Debt nance is the major source of external funding for rms of all sizes FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 72 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 72 10/26/07 6:17:16 AM 10/26/07 6:17:16 AM73FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY in relationship lending on a small scale (Honohan and Beck 2007).20 For lenders willing to put in the effort, however, relationship lending can be pro table. C r edi t n etw o r ks tha t e m p l o y an d s ustain a f o rm o f social cap i tal through relationship lending have long been observed in different parts of the world. These networks are often characterized by a common ethnicity of the participants, although ethnic group membership does not automatically convey membership in the credit network. 21 Biggs and Shah (2006) describe credit networks observed in the responses to enterprise surveys in a sample of African countries in the 1990s. 22 They show that a common ethnicity greatly increases the likelihood of a trade credit relationship between any two rms, and that a lengthy speci c relationship history between the two rms involved in the credit transac- tion is not required: network membership itself seems to be suf cient. Credit between rms from different networks is much less likely and does require a lengthy trading relationship. As a result, rms that are not in the dominant networks are effectively shut out of credit, resulting in ethnically biased nancial access. For example, enterprises that form part of a network of European-owned or Asian-owned rms enter at a larger size, show higher productivity, and grow faster compared with other African enterprises. 23 To overcome the de facto exclusion of the latter from these networks based on relationship lending, it would be desir-able to build the infrastructures that allow a move towards the greater formality and anonymity of modern transaction-based lending. Corruption in India and the strong pro-state orientation of formal nance in China mean that relationship lending has had to assume an important role in supporting the recent fast growth of rms in those countries, as documented by Allen, Qian, and Qian (2005, 2008) and by Allen and others (2006). For the rms that responded to their sur- vey in India, informal governance mechanisms, such as those based on reputation, trust, and relationships, are more important than formal mechanisms, such as courts, in resolving disputes, overcoming corrup-tion, and supporting growth. Apparently, the pervasiveness of petty corruption more than offsets the advantages of inheriting the common law legal origin in India, inhibiting the growth of transactional lending. Despite the need to rely on relationship lending, however, the Indian economy has managed to grow at a rapid rate, showing the potential for these mechanisms to substitute at least partially for more formal nance in a very poor country. Likewise in China, the fast growth of private Informal relationship lending discriminates against rms outside the credit networks\u2014 \u2014though informal nance has lled some of the gaps left by constrained formal systems FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 73 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 73 10/26/07 6:17:16 AM 10/26/07 6:17:16 AMFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 74 rms in some coastal provinces seems to depend a lot on relationship lending (facilitated by Confucian ethics), including from unlicensed private nancial intermediaries, as well as on relationships built on social capital and shared interests with local government of cials. (See box 2.2, however, for a somewhat different perspective). But even where standard types of transactional lending based on transparent nancial accounts are not available, other forms of transac- tion lending may be possible, as Berger and Udell (2006) stress. Provided the relevant laws are in place, asset-based lending such as factoring, xed-asset lending, trade nance, and leasing are technologies that can release sizable nancing fl ows even for small and nontransparent rms to nance the relevant assets. To be sure, factoring does require a degree of creditworthiness but not necessarily of the \"borrower,\" but rather its customers. That may often be the case, as where a major exporter buys on credit from smaller suppliers. As a result, factoring is found to be more prevalent where credit information is good, though it does not seem to require a high degree of property rights protection (Klapper 2006). It is striking that some of these techniques have not been more widely used in developing countries. Leasing, for example, constitutes only a few percentage points of xed investment in the typical developing country, while it reaches up to 20 percent in many developed countries. Similarly, factoring in the United Kingdom reaches 7 percent of GDP, whereas it constitutes less than 1 percent of GDP in most developing countries (Klapper 2006). The limited role of leasing and other nonstandard debt nancing is also illustrated by the nancing patterns reported in chap- ter 1 and potentially refl ects the shortcomings of the underlying legal, informational, and institutional environment, as is discussed later. Credit registries are important tools for the expansion of transac- tions-based lending technologies (Miller 2003; Love and Mylenko 2003; Brown, Jappelli, and Pagano 2006; Powell and others 2004). Credit registries ease for the lender the routine task of verifying aspects of the repayment record (and sometimes the outstanding indebtedness) of the applicant borrower and increase the cost of delinquency, thereby reducing moral hazard. They also help build a database that the lender can use to generate credit scores predicting repayment on the basis of borrower characteristics. This technology is quite mature in the United States, where, as shown by Berger, Frame, and Miller (2005), the use of credit-scoring technology for small business loans has led to an expan-sion in the availability of loans to small and riskier rms, even by larger Other forms of lending can provide nancial access Credit registries and credit scoring can expand access for small rms\u2014 74 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY banks that would hitherto have shied away from this segment. The use of credit scoring for small business lending, often based on data col-lected for credit registry purposes, is growing in developing countries as well (De la T orre, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler 2007), although it has yet to reach many countries: this is banking at what is currently a very active frontier. The more information is stored in the credit registry, the more useful it is in selecting out the risky borrowers without reducing overall access to credit. For instance, Powell and others (2004) use the actual data in the public Argentine credit registry to show that availability of systemwide reg-istry information can substantially improve the precision of credit decisions even for a large bank ( gure 2.6). In addition, they show that availability of positive information (for example, history of borrowings, not just defaults) could enable a lender to lower the default rate from 3.8 percent to 2.9 percent while still lending to 60 percent of the sample borrowers. It is not just the lenders who bene t from better credit information sharing. Using rm-level survey data across 24 transition economies, Brown, Jappelli, and Pagano (2006) nd a positive association between the quality of the credit registry and the ease of external nancing ( gure 2.7). This relationship was con rmed using panel data over time for a limited set of countries. \u2014by helping to identify risky loans Figure 2.6 Credit information sharing and loan losses Source: Based on an experiment using actual data in the Argentine credit registry, as processed by Powell and others (2004).

AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 76While public credit registries may have some potential advantages, such as the power to compel lenders to share positive information, the experience has been that most public registries do not make as much of the information at their disposal as they might. Increasingly public credit registries are being complemented, where they exist, by private credit bureaus. With more countries considering the move to Basel II, which can make use of private credit rating agencies, the credit information industry is likely to see considerable expansion in the years ahead. 24 And the more sophisticated the statistical analyses of loan loss probabilities, the more small borrowers can bene t through cheaper access to bank loans. For instance, using data from the Chilean public credit registry, Adasme, Majnoni, and Uribe (2006) have shown that the distribution of loan losses from small loans (equivalent to less than $20,000) is much less skewed than that for large loans ( gure 2.8). 25 The implication is that, while banks making small loans do have to set aside larger provisions against the higher expected losses from small loans\u2014and therefore they need to charge higher rates of interest to cover Figure 2.7 Credit information sharing and rms' nancing constraints Source: Brown, Jappelli, and Pagano (2006). Note: This gure plots the quality of credit information sharing against the across 24 transi- tion countries.

It is important that in making regulatory arrangements, such as those of Basel II, policy makers do not neglect such ndings and unnecessarily penalize small borrowers. The Role of Foreign Banks The growing market share of foreign-owned banks in developing and transition economies has resulted from a number of forces, including the privatization of long-established state-owned banks (in response to their disappointing nancial and economic performance) and the aftermath of banking crises, when distressed banks were put up for sale, often after being nancially restructured at the expense of the host country govern- ment. Foreign banks were often the successful acquirers, transforming the ownership structure, especially in many parts of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Foreign banks have also entered de novo, although typically remaining relatively small in that case. In addition Figure 2.8 Credit loss distribution for portfolios of large and small loans Source: Adasme, Majnoni, and Uribe (2006). Note: This gure shows the loan loss distribution for portfolios of large and small loans based on data from Chile. Although the probability of loss on small loans is higher, the median percent loss on large loans is much higher and there are far more very high losses for large loans. 8 6 4 2 0 0.016 0.025 0.034 0.043 0.053 0.080 0.071 0.062 % likelihood of lossMedian % loss on loan Large loans Small loans FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 77 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 77 10/26/07 6:17:19 AM 10/26/07 6:17:19 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 78to the big international banks, foreign entry has come from regionally specialized banks or those from a neighboring country often exploiting close business or cultural ties (Claessens and van Horen 2007). Foreign owners bring capital, technology, know-how, and a degree of independence from the local business elite. It has been suggested that they can help stabilize the banking system and the macroeconomy, and they have tended to be more ef cient and pro table than incumbent banks in developing countries. But have they improved access? This is a highly contested issue. Most foreign banks are relatively large (at least in their global operations) and may struggle to understand aspects of the local business culture. It is a commonplace observation in advanced countries that large banks have a comparative advantage in transactions banking based on \"hard\" information, whereas the comparative advantage for relationship lending to small or otherwise opaque rms lies with small, thus local, banks. The progressive extension of credit information will tend to erode these differences over time, but there is no doubt that the credit environment in developing countries tends to be considerably more opaque than in advanced economies. Could it therefore be that in countries relying heavily on foreign banks, the SME sector will experi-ence more limited access to credit? Indeed, many foreign banks do not concentrate on SME lending but stick mainly to the banking needs of larger rms and high-net-worth individuals. 26 Foreign banks are more ef cient and can undercut the local banks in their targeted segments. But that does not imply that foreign entry will result in lower system-wide availability of credit for SMEs. Instead, the increased competition for large customers can drive other banks to focus more on providing pro table services to segments they had formerly neglected. 27 Ultimately this is an empirical issue, and one on which much recent evidence from developing countries has accumulated, although with somewhat contrasting results across different regions. Overall, foreign bank entry has been a welcome improvement for larger rms, and this improved credit access has in many countries extended to smaller rms. Nevertheless there are also some indications that the arrival of foreign banks has not always been good for small rm access to credit, at least at rst. 28 The evidence on the impact of foreign banks comes from a myriad of different types of analysis on different types of data sources; some international, some (more ne-grained) at the national or subnational level.A growing market share for foreign-owned banks excites controversy The evidence suggest foreign banks bene t rms of all sizes\u2014 ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY The benchmark research nding on the relation between nancial access and foreign bank presence comes from a reanalysis of the responses to access questions in the WBES surveys. In a very direct approach that yielded striking results, Clarke, Cull, and Martinez Peria (2006) found that respondent rms were less likely to rate high interest rates and access to long-term loans as major obstacles in countries with sizable foreign bank shares. The effect was stronger for larger rms but was present even for small rms ( gure 2.9). 29 Figure 2.9 Foreign bank participation and nancing obstacles Source: Clarke, Cull, and Martinez Peria (2006), table 3. Note: This gure shows the likelihood that small, medium, and large enterprises rank high interest rates and lack of access to long-term loans as the major obstacles in developing countries at the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile of foreign bank ownership, holding other rm and country characteristics constant. Small rms are de ned as those with 5-50 employees, medium rms as those with 51-500 employees, and large rms as those with 500 or more employees.80 70605040302010 0Small MediumProportion of firms ranking high interest rate as an obstacle Large20th percentile50th percentile80th percentile 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Small MediumProportion of firms ranking access to long-term loans as an obstacle Large20th percentil e 50th percentil ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 80One contrary suggestion that a larger share of foreign bank ownership might not always be so good for nancial development or access comes from broad-brush aggregate cross-country data. Con ning themselves to low-income countries (the poorest 60 or so) Detragiache, Gupta, and Tressel (2006) found that a higher share of foreign-owned banks is sig-ni cantly and negatively correlated with private credit growth, even after controlling for some other national variables. This somewhat surprising result does not hold for middle- and upper-income countries and may refl ect the more cautious approach that foreign banks take in countries with de cient legal and information infrastructures. G r ea t e r ri chn ess o f evi d e n ce is o b tain ed if bank - b y - bank da ta fo r locally owned and foreign-owned banks is available for comparing behavior between the two groups and also to see whether more entry by foreign banks affects the behavior of local banks. Among recent stud-ies taking this approach, Clarke and others (2005) collected data from bank supervisory entities in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru for the late 1990s, a period in which there was substantial foreign entry in that region. The data included each bank's origin (and, if foreign, its mode of entry; distinguishing between de novo, by acquisition, or long-established), and the share of its lending portfolio going to SMEs. Controlling for the bank's size, age, and nancial performance, they nd that, as expected, foreign banks lend less to SMEs, but that the dif- ferential is largely associated with small banks. There is little difference between the share of small business lending in the portfolio of medium and large foreign-owned and domestic banks\u2014with foreign banks even nudging ahead in Chile and Colombia. 30 This bank-level evidence is partly con rmed by rm-level evidence from transition economies, which have also seen rapid foreign bank entry over the past 15 years, with foreign-owned banks accounting for over 90 percent of total credit in several countries. Examination of rm-level data (from the Amadeus database) on medium and large rms in that region shows that the process of foreign bank entry has been associated with more rapid sales growth and total assets of large rms, and an increase in both rm entry and exit rates. Using 60,000 rm-year observations covering the period 1993-2002, 31 Giannetti and Ongena (2005) also found that these effects were stronger for rms in sectors that are more bank-susceptible (in the sense explained above). However, they also found that foreign bank entry was negatively asso-ciated with the growth of the smaller rms in their sample. It remains \u2014although the impact of foreign banks has not always been positive\u2014 \u2014especially for smaller rms in the short term FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 80 10/26/07 6:17:20 AM 10/26/07 6:17:20 AM81FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY to be seen to what extent this experience proves to be a transitional one, both in the sense of being speci c to the rapid structural changes that were happening in Eastern Europe in those years\u2014indications are that rms established from 1989 through 2003 did not bene t so much from foreign bank entry\u2014and in the sense of evolving over time as the foreign banks' behavior matures. Foreign bank managers in Eastern Europe themselves report an evolution in their strategy toward a focus on smaller rms as the lending environment becomes both more competitive and more transparent. The arrival or expansion of foreign banks, however, can also be disruptive, generating extensive changes in economic behavior. A study in India by Gormley (2004) is highly instructive in this regard. He shows that the state-owned development banks reduced the volume of long-term lending in districts where foreign banks had entered. The newcomers took up only some of the slack. While they gave some rms more credit than these rms had before\u2014in effect skimming the cream of the best clients\u2014they did not take on all of the clients dropped by the state-owned development banks, regardless of pro tability. Many of those rms that thus lost access to long-term bank nance were able to make up the de ciency, however, because they were part of an industrial group. Gormley was unable to detect any adverse consequences of the refocusing of bank lending in sales or bankruptcies. 32 Gormley notes that in the years following entry the foreign banks seem to have expanded the clientele to whom they would lend, but even though the liberalization that triggered entry started in 1994, he suggests that it is still too early to determine the scale of long-term effects. Also, as observers of the Indian scene will be aware, foreign entry was not the only source of heightened competition in India; bank privatization also contributed to increased competition. Mian' s (2006) study of 80,000 bank loans in Pakistan during the period 1996-2002 throws light on the possible limitations of many international banks when it comes to lending in developing countries. He nds that foreign-owned banks were more conservative, shying away from soft-information loans; this was true even for foreign banks that had been present in Pakistan for a very long time. Speci cally, they were less likely to lend to small rms, domestically owned rms, rms that were not part of a business group (that is, groups of rms with overlapping directorships), or those without other banking relationships ( gure 2.10). Mian also compares foreign banks of different nationalities and nds Foreign banks can generate extensive changes in economic behavior Foreign banks tend to avoid relationship lending FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 81 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 81 10/26/07 6:17:20 AM 10/26/07 6:17:20 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 82that non-Asian foreign banks were less likely than Asian banks to lend to Pakistani rms. Second, despite being such conservative lenders, foreign banks did not have lower default rates in Pakistan and were less likely to renegotiate and recover after default. It is not as if all the good bor-rowers were being served by existing locally owned banks: Mian found that during the period under review, private domestic banks established new branches from which they served new, soft-information costumers rather than existing customers from other banks. 33 Foreign bank entry can also infl uence the degree of concentration in a country's banking system (although it is only one contributory factor; Figure 2.10 Bank ownership and borrower characteristics in Pakistan Source: Mian (2006). a.

On the one hand, the arrival of foreign banks injects a degree of competi-tion for the rest; on the other hand, the foreign banks tend to be large and their entry might displace others (Claessens, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Huizinga 2001; Bonin, Hasan, and Wachtel 2004). 34 The competitive structure of banking can also affect the degree to which rms have access, but the effect seems to be highly dependent on other characteristics of the business environment for banking. Greater concentration is often equated with greater monopoly power, but this may not be the case in banking if the various market segments are vulnerable to new entrants (Berger and others 2004). Other indicators of monopoly power are also needed. 35 Nevertheless, big banks almost inevitably enjoy a degree of monopoly power; indeed the logic of modern banking increasingly entails exploiting economies of scale and diversi cation. 36 Some scholars have suggested that a degree of monopoly power for banks might even be good for small borrowers' access to credit. They argue that the investment in relationship banking required to determine whether a small borrower is creditworthy is likely to be rewarded by a stream of pro ts only in an uncompetitive market. 37 If so, only banks with monopoly power will make the effort to build the relationship. However the responses of rms to the WBES survey provide little evi- dence to support the idea that a more concentrated banking system is good for access. Adverse effects of concentration can be found only in low-income countries or in those countries with weak credit information or tight restrictions on the scope of banking (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, an d Maks im o vi c 2004). Al th o ugh s mall , l o w - in co m e co un tri es ma y stand to bene t most from greater banking competition, it is precisely in these that achieving a suf cient number of well-capitalized and quali ed bankers is problematic. A balanced overall statement of the available empirical evidence is that opening to foreign banks has the potential to convey net bene ts by introducing competition and increasing ef ciency and independence of local political processes and that these bene ts are likely to be greater as time goes on and the entrants learn more about local conditions. The bene ts are also likely to be greater in host countries that have the neces- sary information and contractual frameworks and incentive structures in place that facilitate foreign banks doing what they are best at, namely, automated transactions lending. While foreign entry generally generates more competition for the incumbents, the end result may not always be Foreign banks may increase banking concentration\u2014and competition The bene ts of foreign banks are more apparent in the longer term FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 83 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 83 10/26/07 6:17:21 AM 10/26/07 6:17:21 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 84an increase in competition if entry happens through acquisition, espe- cially in a small market. Given the little empirical support for the theory that increased monopoly power improves the access of small borrowers, such entry may not necessarily lead to greater access. There are indica-tions that foreign entry tends to make domestic nancial institutions seek out nontraditional businesses, including services for previously excluded segments of the population, as these institutions nd their traditional businesses coming under competition. Hence, locally managed banks with a business model focused on addressing opportunities in the local business community have the potential to survive foreign entry, adding value by broadening access, especially to the SME sector. Access to Nonbank Debt Finance Where long-term nance is available, the evidence is that it makes a positive contribution to rm growth (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic 1999). But there are numerous barriers to availability of long-term nance. It is not just that banks need to maintain liquidity, an aspect that is often stressed. In reality , well-run banks with a stable deposit base can and do lend at maturities well beyond the nominal maturity of their deposits. Indeed this maturity transformation is one of the key contributions of banking to the wider economic system. Other factors at both the national and rm-level also impose barriers to long-term nance. At the aggregate level, macroeconomic risks loom large in the decision to make a long-term loan, as do weaknesses in the credit infor-mation environment and contract enforcement. 38 In dealing with riskier and more opaque borrowers (for example, small or new rms, or those with an adverse credit history), banks prefer to use shorter-term loans, which can be renewed or renegotiated, so that they can maintain control over the lending relationship and retain the possibility to infl uence rm management during the course of the relationship. 39 For long-term lending, the role for bond nancing is potentially larger, can provide competition for banks, and can serve as a spare tire to be employed in the event of a banking crisis. The potential here should not be exaggerated, however, as Gormley, Johnson, and Rhee (2006), for example, point out in their study of the Korean nancial crisis of 1997-98. When that crisis triggered a freeze in bank lending, a private bond market easily sprang to life, capturing households' savings and channeling them to corporations. But it was the largest corporations, A poor business environment can inhibit long-term bank n a n c i n g FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 84 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 84 10/26/07 6:17:22 AM 10/26/07 6:17:22 ENTRY, AND PRODUCTIVITY the chaebols , that received the nancing, and the public was willing to invest in bonds because it perceived them as a safe investment, assuming that the chaebols would be regarded by the authorities as too big to fail. This public perception was proved correct by the bailout of bond inves-tors after the 1999 collapse of the large chaebol Daewoo. Smaller rms, despite their often better corporate governance structures, were unable to access the bond market even after banks stopped lending. Private bonds can provide a competitive alternative to banks, but banks can also use bonds to exploit their credit appraisal capacity while economizing on capital and liquidity by packaging residential mortgages and other small or medium-size loans into larger units that then can be sold to pension funds and other institutional investors. Mortgage-backed bonds issued by banks perform a similar function and can work in less sophisticated nancial systems. The legal, accounting, and other requirements to make this kind of nancial engineering effective, Bond nancing can provide competition for banks ONE MAJOR RISK THAT CAN ARISE FROM FINANCIAL globalization is the assumption by nancial, and especially non nancial, rms of much greater foreign exchange risk than is prudent. The temptation to do so often arises when macroeconomic and exchange rate policy results in high and volatile nominal inter-est rates for borrowings in local currency, whereas creditworthy borrowers may access foreign currency borrowing either from locally based or foreign banks at much lower nominal interest rates, but accepting the exchange risk. a The combination of availability of foreign capital and high domestic interest rates has often been associated with a policy of xing the exchange rate at what seems an undervalued rate: promoting an export and pro t boom as well as capital infl ows caused by expectations of a nominal currency appreciation. The combination greatly heightens the risks, and a reversal of investor senti- ment can mean very large currency movements and an economic crisis, as has been seen in such disparate cases as Chile in 1982-83 and Indonesia in 1997-98. It is not a simple task to calculate even approximately what a prudent foreign exchange exposure would be for a rm whose non nancial business has an international component. (South African Airlines recently incurred heavy losses as a result of treasury policies that could be characterized as overhedging of foreign exchange.) The scale of onshore dollariza-tion of bank deposits and international xed-interest lending has surged several times in the past couple of decades (De Nicol\u00f3, Honohan, and Ize 2005; Goldstein and Turner 2004), making currency exchange risk a problem that is likely to recur.Box 2.3 When access can be too tempting: risks and use of foreign currency borrowing by rms a. See Allayannis, Brown, and Klapper (2003) for a study of rms' strategies to hedge foreign exchange rate exposure in East Asia before and after the crisis.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 86including the role of independent credit-rating rms to help investors price these bonds, are considerable and beyond the reach of smaller or less advanced markets, but the details need not concern us here. Where bond nancing is possible, it can improve the price and availability of longer-term credit to smaller borrowers. Access to External E quity Even start-up rms need equity to nance working capital; entrepreneurs everywhere have recourse to relatives and friends for initial equity to supplement their own resources. The quantitative importance of internal nancing from retained earnings to help support the growth process has already been discussed. As rms grow, so too does the importance of having access to sources of external equity. Bank loans cannot perform this function. In most countries there are individuals and rms who, in one way or another, arrange private equity for some of the most promis-ing growth rms, but a wider investor clientele can be tapped through a listing on an organized stock exchange. The development of shareholder capitalism depends on strong inves- tor rights and on adequately enforced public disclosure of the nancial condition of public companies (Morck and Steier 2005). Reliance on disclosure and private enforcement mechanisms seems more effective than public enforcement policies and restrictions imposed by authorities (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 2006). In many countries, information and investor protection are not adequate to allow the stock market to ful ll its full potential in establishing the full price of each equity stock. As Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000) and Jin and Myers (2006) show, stock prices of different rms move closely together in the stock exchanges of many countries and especially in countries with weak shareholder rights and lack of rm transparency ( gure 2.11). 40 This contrasts to the situation in advanced economies, where the cor-relation of individual stock prices with the average of the market tends to be rather low. The strong co-movement of stock prices may mean that little rm-speci c information comes into the public arena. As a result, individual rm equity is not, on average, fully priced, and the discount is likely to be greater, the greater the rm's growth prospects. It is not surprising, then, that most of the largest rms in the corporate sector of such countries tend to be controlled by a small elite group of families, as outsiders doubt they will bene t from holding shares\u2014with reason, Stock market development requires a sound regulatory environment FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 86 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 86 10/26/07 6:17:23 AM 10/26/07 6:17:23 AM87FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY as Desai and Moel (2007) document in several spectacular cases. The consequences can be lower investment than optimal.41 Investor rights and transparency might not be enough to foster liquid equity markets. Rather, a critical mass of issues, issuers, and investors seems to be necessary (De la Torre and Schmukler 2007). The recent merger wave among the stock exchanges of developed countries and the deepening of a rather limited set of emerging stock exchanges raise questions about the extent to which smaller emerging countries will have the critical mass to support national stock exchanges or will need to rely on regional or foreign exchanges for rms' funding needs. These ndings con rm the importance of shareholder protection and information for ensuring that the stock market makes external capital available to rms with growth prospects. However, making reforms is not an easy matter. Controlling families often do not seem interested in increasing the transparency of the market or in boosting the rights of minorities (even though such actions could make cheaper capital available). Indeed, they seem to be effective in blocking, through their Figure 2.11 Stock price synchronicity with disclosure and governance Source: Jin and Myers (2006).

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 88rent-seeking activities, a strengthening of the nancial system for fear that a stronger system would allow the emergence of challengers to their incumbency. 42 Venture capital is also more effective when underlying legal protections are present (Cumming, Schmidt, and Walz 2006). Opening up equity markets to the outside world has made a big con- tribution to improving access and cost of equity nance for larger local rms.43 A listing (or ADR44) in a foreign market by such rms improves their access to equity by increasing the share price and making them more attractive for institutional investors, thus generating an incentive for rms to expand (Aggarwal, Klapper, and Wysocki 2005; Levine and Schmukler 2007a). Such listings can import corporate governance (Coffee 2002), although this nding is not refl ected in any sustained increase in the market value of the rm (Levine and Schmukler 2007a). These gains, however, might be partly offset by loss of liquidity in local markets, potentially limiting access to outside equity for smaller rms (Levine and Schmukler 2007b). The net overall impact on the access of small rms is not clear; after all, improved access by large rms may spill over to small ones through trade credit. Furthermore, as larger rms have greater access to, and substitute, these alternative sources of funding for bank nance, banks are likely to become more interested in serving smaller clients. Foreign direct investment offers a partial substitute for local nance, a fact that has proved important in some countries, where it appears to have eased nancing constraints, at least for large, publicly listed rms. 45 To be sure, foreign investors likely choose some of the best-performing local rms in which to invest, so this selection bias needs to be taken into account (Weiss and Nikitin 2004). However, FDI transactions in which rms in advanced economies have acquired listed rms in developing countries have been associated with sizable stock market gains for both acquirer and target. That nding implies consequential gains in pro tability over time, according to a study by Chari, Ouimet, and Tesar (2005) of 1,629 acquisitions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand ( gure 2.12). The mode of entry can be infl uential in determining how productive the investment will be. A particular issue is whether insisting on joint ventures rather than allowing foreign control of the enterprise is better for the host country overall. Moran (2005) has observed that target companies that have been integrated into the foreign acquirer's worldwide External listing by larger rms might not be good for e quity access of smaller rms FDI may ease nancing constraints\u2014 \u2014and improve rm management and use of FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 88 10/26/07 6:17:24 AM 10/26/07 6:17:24 AM89FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY operations tend to be larger, better managed, and more technologically advanced than those whose purpose is to serve protected domestic mar-kets in the host country. Many of the most effective FDI transactions, therefore, go well beyond providing nancial access to the target rms, which instead are swallowed up. With the emergence of large private equity rms in the advanced economies temporarily taking majority stakes in rms in the develop- ing world (such as banks in Korea, following the crisis of 1997-98), the dividing line between FDI and other equity investment has become somewhat blurred. At the same time, locally controlled private equity funds, often af liated with banks or other nancial service providers, ha v e also bee n cr ea t ed in n um e r o us co un tri es.

These transactions are not very fully documented in available data, so they have not been subjected to the same kinds of econometric analysis discussed in this chapter. 46 A half-dozen large emerging economies currently receive most of the fl ow of FDI\u2014Brazil, China (including Taiwan), India, Korea, Russia, and South Africa. This geographic concentration is likely to persist, because Figure 2.12 Returns to shareholders in ac quiring and target rms around the date of FDI announcement Source: Chari, Ouimet, and Teas (2005).Full sam ple12 10% return around announcement8 6 420 East Asia Latin Ame rica Majo rity control acqui redBuye 6:17:25 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 90of the size of these economies, the availability (in some of them) of large, capital-hungry, natural resource-based projects for foreigners to invest in, and the perceived quality of the overall investment environment, including the availability of local currency debt nancing to complete the package and a market on which the equity stake can be fl oated in due course (Rubenstein 2006). Nevertheless, private equity rms have been looking at most countries with increasing interest since 2003, and, while there may be interruptions, private equity may become an increasingly important source of nancing for larger rms with growth potential. Conclusions Availability of external nancing for rms depends on the wider insti- tutional environment; lack of availability does constrain rm growth, and it is one of the more important business obstacles rms have to overcome. Access to nance contributes to rm entry, growth, and innovation, among other things. Small and new rms are affected the most by nancing constraints. Yet they also bene t the most as nancial systems develop and nancing constraints consequently ease. Empirical evi d e n ce s uggests tha t i t is thr o ugh im p r o ving access f o r e n t e rp rises that nancial sector development makes an important contribution to economic growth. While relationship lending remains important in many parts of the world, the modern trend is increasingly toward transactional lending. In this regard, good credit registries can be a powerful force for expand-ing the reach of lenders. Not least because international banks have a comparative advantage in transactional lending, their arrival or expan-sion in a country can cause natural apprehension about their possible effect on broad access to credit. However, the balance of a large body of evidence is that even where foreign entrants are highly selective in their target credit market, access to credit from the system as a whole usually improves. And it is increasingly likely to do so as time goes on. In contrast, the performance of state-owned banks in this dimension has tended to be poor. Nonbank nance remains much less important in most developing countries, but that too can be expected to change. Bond nance is an increasingly important alternative to bank nance, mainly for large rms. Access to external equity requires strong investor rights; where these are Barriers to nance are a major obstacle, especially for new and small rms Foreign banks improve access to nance, especially in the longer term Nonbank nance has a growing role to play 10/26/07 6:17:25 AM 10/26/07 6:17:25 AM91FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY present, opening to capital infl ows can greatly improve access and lower the cost of capital. That is true both for portfolio equity investments and for foreign direct investment and private equity, which are likely to become increasingly important. While bond and equity markets are most directly relevant for improving access to nance for larger rms, these markets are also likely to have an indirect effect on access for small rms, as trade credit represents an important source of external nance for many small rms. Notes 1. There is a large empirical literature on nancing constraints that arise because of information asymmetries and on the resulting agency problems between lenders and borrowers (see surveys by Schiantarelli 1995; Blundell, Bond, and Meghir 1996; Hubbard 1998; and Bond and Van Reenen 1999). While most of this literature has tried to infer nancing constraints indirectly from investment-cash fl ow correlations or deviations from optimal investment patterns, studies highlighted in this chapter use more direct measures. Also see Beck and others (2006), who use the WBES survey data discussed in the text and show that self-reported nancing constraints are robustly correlated with rm size, age, and ownership (domestic or foreign). 2. The increase in sales was proportional to the increase in bank credit, another piece of evidence to support the authors' hypothesis that credit con-straints were at work. While the increase in pro ts might be partly explained by the subsidized interest on directed lending, the magnitude seems too large to be the sole factor. 3. Surveyed businesses in the WBES were asked (among other things) to rate nancing, legal, and corruption obstacles, as well as others, on a scale from 1 (no obstacle) to 4 (major obstacle), to refl ect the extent to which these obstacles affected the growth of their business. Regressing rm sales growth on nancing, corruption, and legal obstacles, while controlling for rm and country characteristics, shows that all three obstacles signi cantly constrain rm growth. If all three obstacles are entered in the regression, nancing and legal obstacles still remain negative and signi cant, while the corruption obstacle loses its signi cance. 4. This is evidenced for example by the increased willingness of rms to diversify by acquiring intangible assets in countries where property rights are secure (Claessens and Laeven 2003). 5. Using household survey data from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7- Kunt, Klapper, and Panos (2007) AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 92individuals. They nd that personal wealth predicts the choice of becoming an entrepreneur, as does receiving remittances (although negatively). However, access to bank nance predicts survival as an entrepreneur beyond the rst year. 6. Speci cally, respondents were asked whether they had (i) developed a major new product line; (ii) upgraded an existing product line; (iii) introduced new technology that has substantially changed the way that the main product is produced; (iv) discontinued at least one product (not production) line; (v) opened a new plant; (vi) closed at least one existing plant or outlet; (vii) agreed to a new joint venture with a foreign partner; (viii) obtained a new licensing agreement; (ix) outsourced a major production activity that was previously conducted in-house; or (x) brought in-house a major production activity that was previously outsourced. 7. Measurement error in a causal variable tends to bias the OLS (ordinary least squares) estimates downward, whereas reverse causality or an unobserved common causal factor would tend to bias the OLS estimates upward. This downward bias has been noted in econometric studies of other supposed causes of growth as well (Pande and Udry 2006). Note however that this interpre-tation depends on the use of valid instruments in the attempt to adjust for endogeneity. Using an invalid instrument (for example, one that should really be included in the equation as an explanatory variable) will bias the adjusted (instrumental variables) estimate. 8. The supposed inef ciency of Chinese bank lending should not be over- stated, though, especially for recent years. Using rm-level survey data, Cull and Xu (2000, 2003) nd that bank nance was associated with higher subsequent rm productivity in the 1980s, while government transfers were not. This relationship, however, weakened in the 1990s. Drawing on a sample of mostly small and medium Chinese rms, which account for the most dynamic part of the Chinese economy, Ayyagari, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2007b) show that those receiving bank credit around 2002 did tend to grow more quickly than the average rm, whereas those receiving funds from informal sources did not. This suggests that even if the bulk of Chinese bank credit has not been directed to nancing the most productive rms, credit decisions of Chinese banks regarding smaller enterprises have been associated with faster rm growth, and the formal nancial system is still better than the informal one in picking the best performers. 9. That Vietnam has also seen perverse fl ows of credit is argued by Malesky and Taussig (2005), who nd that despite rapid increases in both bank deposits and credit in recent years, suggestive of nancial development, this additional credit does not seem to have found its way into the provinces where it is most needed, that is, provinces with the highest share of private entrepreneurs. Private entrepreneurs seem to be crowded out systematically by state-owned enterprises. Connection to the government and the party, in contrast, seem to FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 92 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 92 10/26/07 6:17:26 AM 10/26/07 6:17:26 AM93FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE: ENTRY, GROWTH, AND PRODUCTIVITY help private entrepreneurs gain access to credit. These authors also nd a nega- tive relationship between access to credit and investment growth. Simply put, rms receiving bank nance in Vietnam are not the engines of growth. At the same time, expanding private rms seem to rely mostly on retained earnings and personal savings to nance investment. There is one positive exception to this disappointing picture: in more competitive provinces, that is, in those where there are more private entrepreneurs per capita competing for credit, easier access to credit is positively related to investment growth. Overall, these results point to a misallocation of banking credit to connected rms in less competitive regions of the country. 10. Also, Rajan and Zingales (1998) nd the growth effect of nance only on industries that need it most, and not on all industries, suggesting that it is the ef ciency of nancial intermediation that matters, not simply capital accumulation. 11. See, for example, Rioja and Valev (2004a, b).12. Noting that most enterprises need some initial wealth, Aghion, Fally, and Scarpetta (2006) see the nancial system as allowing entrepreneurs to lever- age this initial wealth\u2014the better developed the nancial system, the higher the leverage, a phenomenon that allows ef cient newcomers to displace even well- nanced but inef cient incumbents. Working with data on more than 10,000 rms drawn mainly from national business registries and administra- tive records in 16 countries, including 7 developing or transition economies (and using the susceptibility measure of Rajan and Zingales, mentioned in box 2.1), they nd that national policies that restrict credit availability tend to limit entry and growth of small rms to a much larger extent than do labor market regulations. On the other hand, large rm entry is not affected by nancial development. 13. Given that exporting rms face xed costs and might therefore depend m o re o n external nan ce than o th er rms, Becker an d G reen berg (200 5) conjectured that countries with higher levels of nancial development should have higher exports. And indeed\u2014using bilateral trade data and controlling for other variables in a gravity regression\u2014they nd that countries with higher levels of nancial development export more. This effect is stronger in industries in which exporters potentially face higher xed costs, as proxied by the lack of standardization, or for exports to nonneighboring countries or countries with a different language. 14. Using the Rajan and Zingales methodology, Beck (2003) shows coun- tries with better-developed nancial systems have a comparative advantage in industries relying more on external nance. 15. These results are reported by Beck and Levine (2002), who used the same sectoral data source for 42 countries as Rajan and Zingales (1998) (see 6:17:27 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 94box 2.1), but added measures of the relative size or activity of the securities markets and the banking system. 16. Speci cally, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002) found no addi- tional explanatory power when they added a variable indicating the relative size of securities markets and banks to their analysis of the proportion of each county's rms that were growing faster than could be achieved solely with internal resources. But the equations, containing both banking depth and stock market turnover as independent explanatory variables in quadratic form, did suggest that stock market development might be more important than bank development in allowing rm growth that required long-term nancing. (For their dependent variable, they counted the number of rms\u2014out of a total of more than 10,000 from 32 countries\u2014that were expanding sales faster than would seem supportable from internal resources or short-term borrowing, as modeled by a standard nancial planning model. (This study built on a paper they published in 1998; see box 2.1). 17. Of course the dichotomy between banks and markets is also too sim- plistic. Many nonbank institutions, including nondepository mortgage lenders, leasing, and factoring companies, are involved in specialized forms of asset-based nance. And important channels of equity nance\u2014venture capital, business angel nance, and other forms of private equity\u2014can operate without much use of organized securities exchanges. Institutional investors too are important providers of several forms of nancing. The bank-market distinction is never- theless a useful handle: much of what can be said about bank nance applies to nonbank lenders; much of what is important for securities markets is also relevant for private equity. 18. There are good theoretical reasons for debt nance to be the major source of external nance, not least because, relative to other forms of sharing the returns on a project, the debt contract economizes on precise monitoring of project performance (Diamond 1984). 19. De la Torre, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler (2007) show that banks in two very different institutional environments (Argentina and Chile) adapt to lend to SMEs and overcome institutional weaknesses. Banks do so by lending short term, collateralizing their loans, or securing their loans in some other forms. 20. It is perhaps worth emphasizing the difference between relationship lend- ing and related-party lending, which is a form of self-dealing. Although banks often resort to related-party lending where information about other borrowers or contract enforcement is lacking, such lending can ultimately impose social costs, as is well illustrated in the discussion by Maurer and Haber (2004) of Mexico's experience in the early 1900s and by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Zamarripa (2003) of the more recent experiences in East Asia in the 1990s.

A classic account of the Jewish Maghribi traders' network in the late Middle Ages is in Greif (1993). 22. These Regional Program on Enterprise Development surveys were car- ried out in ve African countries during the 1990s. For a book-length discussion of the ndings, see Fafchamps (2004). 23. Fisman (2003) controls more carefully for unobserved rm quality and still nds that rms are more than twice as likely to receive trade credit from within their ethnic community than from outside. However, he also nds that these ethnic ties account for only 15 percent of the overall preferential credit access enjoyed by entrepreneurs of non-African descent. 24. Ensuring that the growth of this industry is based on trustworthy rating agency rms is a nonnegligible challenge (Honohan 2001). 25. Bebczuk (2007) undertook a similar exercise using Argentine data and reported similar ndings. 26. In some countries foreign banks have entered the SME lending market themselves (De la Torre, Martinez Peria, and Schmukler 2007). This does not only imply relying on the transaction-lending techniques mentioned above, but it does imply a learning process for foreign banks. Similarly, bank-survey evidence from transition economies has shown that many foreign banks are taking advantage of the improving contractual and information frameworks in these countries and are applying business models from their mostly West European home countries and (de Haas and Naaborg 2005). Some banks in transition countries also have been expanding intraregionally and moving beyond a traditional focus on large corporations to provide more nancial ser- vices geared to SMEs in host countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where foreign banks have long been criticized for neglecting all but the large, international borrowers, a more differentiated picture has been emerging in recent years (Honohan and Beck 2007). 27. In most cases, an important market segment typically remains to be served by locally owned and smaller banks. Indeed, cross-country evidence (Berger, Hassan, and Klapper 2004) suggests that where smaller non-state-owned local banks have a higher market share, economic growth is stronger, although it has not proved possible to establish that this growth is attributable to more SME lending. 28. The Mexican case, where foreign banks spent $30 billion between 1997 and 2004 and increased the foreign ownership of the Mexican banking sys-tem from 11 to 83 percent, provides an interesting illustration of the fact that large-scale foreign entry is not a panacea even for a highly distressed banking system. Tracking each bank in Mexico, Schulz (2006) shows that, over the period 1997-2004, bank capital strengthened, the quality of the loan portfolio FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 95 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 95 10/26/07 6:17:28 AM 10/26/07 6:17:28 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 96improved, and there appears to have been a modest increase in productivity (the latter always hard to measure in banking because of its multiple joint outputs). During this period, bank lending to the private sector continued the slump that had begun with the crisis of 1994; there has since been a recovery. But Haber and Musachio (2005) nd it impossible to detect any indication in the data that foreign acquisition slowed credit granting by a bank, although the foreign banks did effectively screen out problem borrowers and were ahead of the others in achieving reduced loan losses. 29. Of course one might get such results if foreign banks tend to be attracted to countries where the nancial market works well anyway. To control for this, Clarke, Cull, and Martinez Peria (2006) also looked at rms' opinions about access to nonbank nance. It turns out that the presence of foreign banks has no signi cant impact on the responses to the control question. 30. It is not so easy to draw conclusions about the interest rates charged. For example, using the same basic data sources, Martinez Peria and Mody (2004) found that whether bank entry was by merger, acquisition, or de novo, foreign-owned banks charge narrower margins, by 50 basis points on average, than domestic banks; and the difference is even larger for de novo foreign banks. Of course, with interest rates differing widely between customer types, it is dif cult to be sure that the control variables are adequate to reveal a true price differential, rather than a refl ection, for example, of foreign banks lending to low-risk, low-spread borrowers, and funding on wholesale terms. 31. And using instruments that predict foreign bank entry, but not rm growth, in a convincing attempt to ensure that the measured effects were not attributable to a common hidden cause. 32. Even rms outside a formal group structure can indirectly access bank credit if they are granted increased trade credit from rms with growing bank borrowings. T rade credit in effect offers credit access to an additional layer of rms, exploiting information and other bilateral relationships (Fisman and Love, 2003; Omiccioli 2005). 33. But the same database from Pakistan has also thrown light on the poten- tial de ciencies of state-owned banks and speci cally on the nexus between politicians and state-owned banks (see chapter 4). 34. Levy Yeyati and Micco (2007) argue that the extensive foreign bank entry in Latin America in the 1990s resulted in a less competitive banking system overall, although this contention is not undisputed. Their evidence comes from showing that bank revenues became less sensitive to variations in input costs, as happens with a monopolist charging \"what the market will bear,\" in contrast to a competitive system that effectively fully passes on changes in input prices to the customer.

For example Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Laeven, and Levine (2004) show that restri cti o ns o n bank en try , m easured b y th e fracti o n o f en try ap p li cati o ns rejected by the regulatory agency, are more closely correlated with interest margins than with concentration. Using data on net interest margins of some 1,165 banks from 47 countries, they nd that countries that restrict foreign bank entry end up with higher bank margins. 36. It seems that transactions costs, including those of acquiring informa- tion, are strongly related to distance, resulting in a degree of monopoly power for local banks. Very convincing evidence on this point comes from a market as developed as Belgium, for which Degryse and Ongena (2005) document how the lending rates charged by one bank vary according to the physical distance between the customer and the nearest competitor bank. 37. Studies of this proposition for the United States and other advanced economies show that its applicability is context speci c, with few simple les- sons directly applicable to all developing countries. For instance, Cetorelli and Strahan (2004) show that new entrants found it more dif cult to get nance in U.S. states with less competitive banking markets, but Zarutskie (2005), using data based on corporation tax returns, nds less investment (as indicated by higher rates of return) and less external nancing for small rms following increases in competition resulting from the liberalization of U.S. interstate banking. Using data from different Italian regions, Bonaccorsi di Patti and Dell'Ariccia (2004) nd that bank concentration can have a positive effect on rm entry where information is opaque. Bertrand, Schoar, and Thesmar (2007) show that the far-reaching French banking liberalization of the 1980s did not uniformly increase credit availability but made it more sensitive to borrowers' business prospects. 38. Using data on 27,000 publicly listed rms in 27 developed economies and 18 developing economies, Sorge and Zhang (2006) nd that countries with better quality of credit information (broader coverage of public and especially private credit registries as well as better accounting standards) are characterized by a higher share of long-term debt as a proportion of total corporate debt. 39. Based on an extensive U.S. survey of small business nance, Ortiz- Molina and Penas (2006) provide evidence that loan maturity is positively correlated with rm size and age and with the amount of collateral posted\u2014 though personal guarantees do not have this effect. Firms that have had a loan delinquency in the previous three years had shorter maturities. 40. The Jin and Myers (2006) results are based on data from 40 stock exchanges and use a variety of measures of opacity, including the diversity of analysts' forecasts, accounting completeness, and auditing activity. 41. Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Love (2002) examine the return on capital for a panel of more than 6,000 listed rms on 38 stock exchanges and detect FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 97 FFA_055-098_ch02.indd 97 10/26/07 6:17:29 AM 10/26/07 6:17:29 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 98a strong and sizable positive relationship between the share of stock held by insiders and the accounting return on capital, suggesting underinvestment in the most closely held rms. With such a high return, they \"should\" have invested more. The degree of ownership concentration is also strongly correlated with an index of shareholder protection (measuring, for example, whether voting is proportional to shareholding, use of proxy voting, and the right of minor-ity shareholders to challenge oppressive majority decisions in court). See also Burkart, Panunzi, and Shleifer (2003) and Nenova (2003). 42. For a review of these and other issues related to family control, see Morck and Yeung (2003). 43.

An American Depository Receipt (ADR) is, in effect, a repackaging of a non-U.S. equity into a convenient form for U.S. investors to trade in U.S. stock markets. Depository receipts are also traded in the securities markets of some other advanced economies. 45. This, at least, was the nding of Harrison, Love, and McMillan (2004), who took data for 7,000 rms from 40 countries and estimated the sensitivity of each rm's investment decisions to its available cash. The authors were exploit- ing the idea that if a rm has easy access to nance, it should be able to nance pro table investment opportunities regardless of the immediate availability of cash balances. In practice, rms' investments do tend to be sensitive to their cash holdings. But this sensitivity proves to be lower for rms in countries with high inward FDI. Contrary, then, to the fears of some that inward FDI would tap local capital markets, diverting funds from incumbent rms, it seems that FDI does brings its own funding with it. In speci c cases, though, borrowing from banks by foreign-owned rms could crowd out local rm nancing. Another paper by Harrison and McMillan (2003) nds this crowding-out effect for Cote d'Ivoire, which the authors conjecture may result from the existence of interest ceilings and the links between many of the foreign-owned rms with the French parents of the local banks. 46. An interesting study by Da Rin, Nicodano, and Sembenelli (2004) shows the way. It uses information on the size of private equity investments in 14 European countries. The authors track the impact of policy and other variables on the division of these funds between early stage (seed and venture capital) and late stage, and between high-tech and other sectors.

This chap- ter returns to the questions rst raised in chapter 1: Well-functioning nancial systems contribute to growth, but do poor households bene t proportionately from nancial reforms that strengthen the economy generally? To what extent is an emphasis on nancial sector development as a driver of growth consistent with a pro-poor approach to develop-ment? Or could the deepening of nancial systems lead to a widening of income inequalities? Must poor households and microentrepreneurs have direct access to nancial services for there to be meaningful poverty reduction? What techniques are most effective in ensuring sustainable provision of credit and other nancial services on a small scale? This chapter reviews the ndings of recent research on these questions. Although several theoretical models have highlighted the risk that selec-tively increased access to credit could worsen inequality, the empirical evidence does not seem to bear out this risk. Instead, available evidence suggests that a more developed nancial system tends to reduce inequal- ity in the long run. That is not simply because micro nance could help the poor directly\u2014indeed the evidence from microstudies of favorable impacts from direct access of the poor to credit is not especially strong. The conclusions of studies using calibrated general equilibrium models, speci c policy experiments, and econometric analysis of cross-country data tend to be more positive than are those of the microstudies. These studies alert us to the likely importance of indirect effects in explaining the relationship between nancial development and income inequality. These effects are well tracked in the general equilibrium models discussed below, which show that better nancial access for The empirical evidence suggests that nancial sector development is consistent with a pro-poor approach to development\u2014 \u2014but some of the most important links may be indirect FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 99 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 99 10/26/07 8:40:03 AM 10/26/07 8:40:03 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 100nonpoor entrepreneurial households has a strongly favorable, indirect effect on the poor. These ndings imply that for nancial development to have maximum impact on pro-poor growth, the focus should be broadened from improving nance for the poor to improving nance for all. That is particularly true in many developing countries, where large segments of the middle class are still among the nancially excluded, as was discussed in chapter 1. Delivering broader access is the task of a growing array of nancial institutions, including specialized micro nance institutions (MFIs), cooperatives, and savings banks. The techniques they use to reach a wider clientele, while controlling both risks and operating costs, are evolving, as is their use of information and communication technology. This chapter reports on recent research that has thrown much light on the relative importance of different obstacles to improved access at the micro level and on the techniques that work well, particularly given the recent trends of globalization and technological advances. Finance, Inequality, and Poverty At the outset, it is not immediately obvious that expanding access to nancial services will reduce inequality. After all, the successful microentrepreneur who manages to get nancing for her ideas will experience an increase in income that her neighbor does not. Indeed, the more successful she becomes, the wider the income gap would be. This increase in income inequality is what is predicted by some of the theories discussed in chapter 1. At the same time, giving people a wider set of growth opportunities through increased access to nance should eliminate inequities caused by barriers to such access. At the end of the day, the net result of greater nancial access on measured inequality will be an empirical issue, and it is one on which there is a considerable body of recent research. Theoreticians have developed simple, stylized models to analyze these questions. Imagine a world in which individuals, differing in their wealth and entrepreneurial skills, must choose between subsistence farming, wage work, or entrepreneurial endeavor. Without access to external nance, the amount of investment an entrepreneur has to start is limited to her wealth. Start-up costs will often be too large to allow poorer or less-skilled individuals to become en trepreneurs, so they will remain Access can be provided by a range of institutions Theory suggests that greater nancial access could raise income inequality in the short term\u2014 100 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION subsistence farmers or work for a wage if it is high enough. Introducing a banking sector into such a world allows skilled entrepreneurs to borrow to nance setup costs. Although such a stylized world is far from the complex reality of even the very poor in developing countries, it offers a glimpse of the range of possible impacts on growth, inequality, and welfare that can come from increasing access to nance. But the size and even the nature of these impacts depend on the magnitude of, for example, the behavioral responses, the distribution of skills and wealth, and the productivity of labor and capital. Is it possible to derive realistic estimates of the size of these various parameters from what is known about the economic decisions of actual individuals and households? A paper by Gin\u00e9 and Townsend (2004) attempts to do just that. Drawing o n da ta fr o m a co ll ecti o n o f s urv eys o f Thai h o useh o l ds, str et ching from 1976 to 1996, the authors use information about wealth, wage rates, nancial transactions, and occupational choices to estimate some of the model's parameters; they calibrate other parameters to help the model t the evolution of Thai growth and savings rates. The authors then use this model to simulate how increasing the share of households with access to credit affects entrepreneurship, employment, wages, and ultimately growth and income distribution. Gin\u00e9 and Townsend compare the evolution of growth and inequal- ity in the model with the actual development in the Thai economy and show that nancial liberalization and the consequent increase in access to credit services can explain the fast GDP per capita growth in the Thai economy during the period, but they also initially increase income inequality. Underlying these developments are occupational shifts from the subsistence sector into the intermediated sector, that is, the sector with access to credit and accompanying changes in wages. Net welfare bene ts of increased access are found to be substantial. Although they are concentrated disproportionately on a small group of talented, low-wealth individuals, who without credit could not become entrepreneurs, a wider class of workers also bene ts because eventually wage rates increase as the new entrepreneurs use their newfound access to credit to build their companies. Savers also bene t in the form of higher interest paid on their savings. But there are also losers; these are former entrepreneurs who lose because they have to pay the much higher postliberalization wage rates. 1 When calibrated to t Thai data on nance, growth, and inequality, the general equilibrium model analyzed by Gin\u00e9 and Townsend implies that the greatest quantitative impact of nancial deepening and nancial \u2014which was evident in a study of the Thai economy\u2014 \u2014although the biggest impact was due to higher wages, which led to lower inequality in the longer run FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 101 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 101 10/26/07 8:40:05 AM 10/26/07 8:40:05 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 102access on income inequality comes through indirect labor market effects. Depending on initial conditions and the choice of parameters, these effects also result in a long-term decrease in income inequality tha t o ff -sets sh o rt - t e rm in cr eases co ming fr o m w eal th gains o f n ew entrepreneurs. Although calibrated theoretical models illuminate important aspects of the nancial development process and provide illustrative quanti - cation of these processes, their ndings must be interpreted with care, because they do exclude other potentially important infl uences on growth and inequality. 2 A more direct approach to assessing the impact of access to nance is to zoom in on speci c schemes or experiments in which some, but not all, households are eligible, and try to uncover the consequences both for bene ciaries and for those excluded. Unlike general equilibrium models and the aggregate regression methodology, discussed later, the microanalyses often focus on the direct effect of access to nance on the well-being of households with access, not always taking into account possible spillover and indirect effects that are highlighted in the general equilibrium analyses. The success stories of micro nance are well documented. But to be convinced of the overall bene t of micro nance, skeptics require careful differentiation between those changes that can be clearly attributed to nancial access and those that might have happened anyway or result from other changes in the environment in which micro nance clients operate. In other words, is measurement of the true effect biased by a selection effect? For example, was it the more talented or otherwise well-endowed households that actually got the loans and might have prospered even in their absence? Or did the MFI target the village because it was particularly deprived and hence may have bene ted even if its condition remains behind that of unserved villages? How speci c is the impact to the village; can the same MFI scheme have the same effect in other villages? Numerous studies have attempted to nd ways of answering these questions on the basis of particular features of the MFI design. Deb a t e s urr o un ding ev e n th e m ost fam o us MFI , Banglad esh' s Grameen Bank, illustrates how dif cult this task has been. In a cel- ebrated and very careful study of Grameen Bank and two other MFIs in Bangladesh, Pitt and Khandker (1998) exploited an exogenous eligibility criterion: to be eligible for credit from these three MFIs, households could not own more than one-half acre of land. All other things being equal, the difference in the fortunes of two households with just under Finance and poverty\u2014 the micro evidence The bene ts of micro nance ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION and just over half an acre could be attributed to the program. The sharp cutoff of the eligibility criterion seemed to allow the researchers to avoid a selection-effect bias. Using appropriate econometric techniques to correct in this way for selection, Pitt and Khandker found small but signi cant and positive effects of the use of credit on household expenditures, household assets, labor supply, and the likelihood that children attend schools. 3 This effect was stronger for female program participants than for male participants. The study also found that labor supply response was surprisingly low compared with the response of assets and expen-ditures, suggesting that the effect of nance goes through productivity of labor, rather than the amount. However, even this research has not gone unchallenged. For example, there is doubt that the half-acre rule was systematically and rigorously applied. If it was not, then its use to correct for selection bias is weak-ened. Khandker (2003), using panel data from a follow-up survey on the same group of borrowers, was able to obtain more precise estimates by controlling for unobserved, but time-invariant borrower character-istics. His results suggest a substantially lower impact of credit than the original Pitt and Khandker study found. Another opportunity to assess the impact of access to credit while avoid- ing selection bias was seized by Coleman (1999), who studied microcredit borrowers in northeast Thailand. He exploited the fact that six commu-nities had been identi ed as future locations for village banks, and that there was a list of self-selected villagers who wanted to apply for loans once the banks were established. By comparing these borrowers-in-waiting with actual borrowers of existing banks in other villages, Coleman could reasonably hope to have corrected for the selection bias that would have resulted from simply surveying a random group in the not-yet-served vil-lages. 4 He found no signi cant impact of credit on physical assets, savings, production sales, productive expenses, labor, or expenditures on health care or education. In a similar study, Cotler and Woodruff (2007) compared small-scale retailers receiving loans from a Mexican micro nance lender with a similar group of retailers that had been selected to receive such loans in the future. They found a positive and signi cant effect of the microlending program on sales and pro ts only for the smallest retailers, but a negative effect on larger retailers' sales and pro ts. A more direct way to avoid selection bias is to construct a genuine experiment in which the subjects and the control group are chosen randomly and thus create the necessary exogenous variation needed to \u2014and the empirical evidence is mixed A eld experiment using random selection criteria highlights the bene ts of ALL?

Recently, Karlan and Zinman (2006a) persuaded a South African consumer lender to relax its risk assessment criteria for a randomly chosen group of barely rejected loan applicants. The random nature of the assignment of credit helps the authors to get around the problem of selection bias. 5 Comparing the group of randomly chosen borrowers with the control group of marginally rejected applicants, Karlan and Zinman found that six to twelve months after the loan application, borrowers were signi cantly more likely to retain wage employment, less likely to experi- ence hunger in their household, and less likely to be impoverished. Further research, ideally using real experiments, is needed to convince the skeptics that access to microcredit really is good for the neighborhoods where it becomes established, as most well-informed observers and prac-titioners believe. 6 It has to be said that the current systematic statistical research evidence on the bene ts of microcredit is not yet overwhelming. The studies reviewed here were undertaken in very different institutional settings and with different credit products. Individual or household welfare is notoriously dif cult to measure, which biases microanalysis against nd- ing a positive effect of access to credit. More research is needed to assert whether there is a robust and positive relationship between the use of credit and household welfare, including moving out of poverty. Several other studies have used cross-sectional household data to assess the impact of access to nance on households' consumption patterns, income prospects, and the decision to send children to school rather than using them as laborers in the household. Most of these studies, however, use proxy measures of access to nance such as durable assets, which can be used as collateral, rather than the direct measures used by the studies mentioned above. Survey data of this type for Peru suggest that lack of access to credit reduces the likelihood that poor households send their children to school, while studies for Guatemala, India, and Tanzania point to households without nancial access as being more likely than households with more assets to reduce their children's school attendance and increase their labor if they suffer transitory income shocks. Survey data for Guatemalan microentrepreneurs show a positive effect of credit use on upward class mobility, allowing them to expand their businesses. Finally, consumption patterns of Indonesian households that live closer to the nearest BRI branch, the largest MFI lender in the country, show smaller or no effects from health shocks compared with households liv-ing farther away. 7 Box 3.1 discusses the links between access to nancial services and some of the Millennium Development Goals. \u2014but more research is needed in this area FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 104 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 104 10/26/07 8:40:07 AM 10/26/07 8:40:07 AM105HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION IN 2000, 189 NATIONS ADOPTED THE MILLENNIUM Declaration, specifying eight Millennium Development Goals, including eradicating extreme poverty by 2015. The other goals concern education (universal primary education), gender equality, health (reductions in child and maternal mortality and reversing the spread of AIDS, malaria, and other dis-eases), environment, and global partnerships. While access to nancial services is not explicitly mentioned among these goals, both theory and numerous empiri-cal studies, including many mentioned in this text, suggest that access to nancial services is an important direct or indirect contributor to the achievement of most of the goals (Claessens and Feijen 2006; Little eld, Morduch, and Hashemi 2003). In the case of education and health, one impor- tant effect of access to nancial services is through the income effect: better access to nancial services improves incomes and therefore the possibility of obtaining health and education services, and at the same time it reduces the need to rely on children as laborers in the household. Allowing women direct access t o nan cial servi ces migh t im p ro v e their possibilities to become entrepreneurs, thus increasing their individual incomes, their chances to become more independent, and their participa- tion in family and community decision making. There is also an important insurance effect: bet-ter access to credit, savings, or insurance services reduces the need to use child labor as a buffer in the case of seasonal income fl uctuations and transitory income shocks and allows consumption smoothing in the case of transitory income reductions resulting from health shocks. It also allows faster attention to health problems. Finally , there is an aggregate infrastructure effect, with more ef cient nancial institutions and markets allowing more private and p ub li c in v estm en t in th e co nstru cti o n o f sch oo ls and health facilities. The links between access to nance and the goals of environmental stability and global partnerships might be less obvious and have not been researched very thoroughly. However, arguments can be made for such relationships, at least at the aggregate level. Ensuring environmental stability will require large investments in new technologies, and nancial depth has shown to be conducive for capital reallocation across sectors. Finally, the goal of global cooperation will be hard to achieve without better functioning global nancial markets. Box 3.1 Access to nance and the Millennium Development Goals T o evaluate the effect of increasing nancial access for households and microentrepreneurs, one has to look beyond the direct impact on the household or enterprise and assess the impact on the whole economy. That cannot be done through micro studies. In particular, even if the very poor do not themselves gain access to nancial services, they may bene t substantially from increased employment and other opportunities resulting from the activities of less-poor microentrepreneurs whose access has improved. With large numbers of the nonpoor still excluded from access to credit, these systemic effects could include trickle-down effects for the poor from improved access for the nonpoor. However, they could also include perverse trickle-down effects: if only a subset of households in a village has access to credit or insurance to smooth consumption, Finance, inequality and poverty\u2014the aggregate evidence FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 105 8:40:07 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 106that subset will bid up the price of nontraded goods when a negative shock hits the village, so excluded households will be worse off than if nobody had access to credit or insurance (Morduch 2006). Chapter 2 has already discussed the evidence for a strong causal link between nancial development, as measured by nancial depth, and overall national economic growth. That chapter also identi ed improved access to nance by rms as an important channel through which this effect works. If income growth rates of the poor remain broadly in line with those of the rest of the population, aggregate economic growth will mean a reduction in absolute poverty as more households graduate beyond the poverty threshold (Ravallion 2001). Only a sizable fall in the income share of the poor could prevent aggregate economic growth from lowering absolute poverty. 8 If growth reduces the absolute poverty count, it is said to be pro-poor in the absolute sense. Growth that reduces poverty by narrowing income differentials is said to be pro-poor in the relative sense. Recent research suggests that nancial development gener- ates pro-poor growth in both senses. For example, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007) look at cross-country data for varying periods during 1960-2005 to assess the relationship between nancial depth and changes in both income distribution and absolute poverty. They work with a simple decomposi-tion of the income growth of the poorest income quintile into mean per capita national income growth and the change in the share of the poorest quintile. A large body of literature has established that nance has a posi- tive impact on GDP per capita growth; but what about the relationship between nance and changes in the income share of the lowest income quintile? The authors nd a positive relationship between nancial depth (as measured by the ratio of private sector credit to GDP) and the change in the share of the lowest quintile in total national personal income. Not only does a deeper nancial system accelerate national growth, but it is associated with a faster increase in the income share of the poorest group. Indeed, almost half of the bene cial effect of nancial deepening on average income of the poorest quintile comes from this improvement in the (relative) distribution of income. They also obtain similar results when they look at the changes in the Gini measure of income inequality. The relationship between nancial development and the growth rate of the Gini coef cient is negative, suggesting that nance reduces income inequality. Not only are these ndings robust to controlling for other country characteristics associated Financial development reduces poverty through its effect on overall growth\u2014 \u2014increases the income share of the poorest ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION with economic growth and changes in income inequality, but the authors also make an attempt to control for potential reverse causality, using historic variables such as national origin of the legal system to extract an exogenous component of nancial development, as well as panel techniques that control for omitted variable and endogeneity bias. Although cross-country studies are subject to the caveats discussed in box 2.1, these ndings are also consistent with the ndings of general equilibrium models discussed earlier, in that nancial development is associated with reductions in income inequality over the long run. Further evidence is provided by cross-country studies looking at the relationship between nancial development and the level of income inequality. Li, Squire, and Zou (1998) and Li, Xu, and Zou (2000) nd a negative relationship between nance and the level of income inequal- ity as measured by the Gini coef cient, a nding con rmed by Clarke, Xu, and Zhou (2006), using both cross-sectional and panel regressions and instrumental variable methods. In some countries, far more than the bottom 20 percent are poor when measured against the international standard poverty lines of $1 or $2 a day; in other countries almost nobody is poor by these demanding standards. To look more directly at the impact of nancial development on absolute poverty, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007) also estimate the change in the share of each country's population below the international poverty line that results from nancial deepening. Again, they nd a robust effect of nance on poverty alleviation\u2014countries with higher levels of nancial development experienced faster reductions in the share of population living on less than $1 a day over the 1980s and 1990s ( gure 3.1). The economic impact is strong as well, as discussed in box 3.2. The relative importance of economic growth and the distributional impact of nance vary according to initial conditions: not surprisingly, the distributional impact is strongest for countries with relatively high per capita income and a very unequal income distribution, while the growth impact is strongest in relatively poor countries with a relatively equal income distribution. This nance-poverty evidence is consistent with the ndings of Honohan (2004), who showed that even among societies with the same average income, those with deeper nancial systems have lower absolute poverty. These ndings all point in the same direction: policies fostering nancial sector development are not only pro-growth, but also pro-poor in both relative and absolute senses. 9\u2014and lowers poverty 107 8:40:08 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 108The cross-country evidence has the merit of broad coverage, but the quality of the data is uneven from country to country. Gini coef cients, quintile shares, and poverty headcounts are all subject to substantial mea-surement problems. 10 The shortcomings of nancial depth as a measure of nancial development, let alone nancial access, have already been pointed out. That the results obtained with aggregate data are stronger than the results of the micro studies cited earlier may point to the poten-tially greater importance of spillover effects, which are not captured by micro studies. But the stronger results may also refl ect the dif culty of controlling for reverse causality in cross-country regressions. It is there-fore important to seek additional types of evidence for systemic effects of improved nancial access. Two policy changes that can be thought of as akin to natural experiments point in the same direction. One experiment involved the Indian government' s policy on bank branching, imposed between 1977 and 1990. In those years a com-mercial bank in India was allowed to open one new branch in a district that already had a bank presence only after it opened four branches in areas without a bank presence. This policy led to the opening of 30,000 Figure 3.1 Financial depth and poverty alleviation Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007).

Burgess and Pande (2005) nd that as a result of this branching regulation, nonagricultural output grew faster, and poverty declined faster, in states that started the period with a lower level of nancial development, while the opposite was true before and after this period of regulation. Further, wages of agricultural workers grew faster during this period, while the wages of urban factory workers do not show such a time pattern. This seems to suggest that nancial development\u2014trig- gered by the branching regulation\u2014led to faster reductions in poverty. The cost-bene t calculation of this policy, though, is a different matter (see box 4.3 in chapter 4) and suggests that the macroeconomic costs might have been signi cant. Another natural experiment is offered by the branching deregulation implemented by different U.S. states over a 20-year period from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. Following Jayaratne and Strahan (1996), a large literature has evaluated the effect that easing restrictions on intra- and interstate branching had on income growth, banking sector structure, and entrepreneurial activity. The variation in timing of the JUDGING FROM THE REGRESSIONS ESTIMATED BY Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007), the rela- tion between nancial depth and poverty is not only causal and statistically signi cant but sizable. Even after account is taken of the effect of other control variables, almost 30 percent of the cross-country variation in changing poverty rates can be attributed to cross-country variation in nancial development. Consider, for example, the fact that the share of the population in deep poverty (less than $1 a day) fell by 14 percent a year in Chile between 1987 and 2000, whereas it rose at a similar rate in neighbor-ing Peru. Chile has a much deeper nancial sector (p rivate credi t is 4 7 per cen t o f G D P) than P eru (private credit is 17 percent of GDP). The estimated regression implies that had Peru started with the same nancial depth as Chile, its poverty headcount would have grown a full 5 percentage points more slowly, so that by 2002, just 5 percent of Peru's population would have been living on less than $1 a day instead of the actual share of 10 percent. Such comparisons have to be interpreted with cau- tion, though, for several reasons. The regression coef- cients indicate marginal, not large, discrete changes; the variable measuring nancial depth is only a proxy; omission from the equation of other unmeasured causal variables may be exaggerating the measured impact of nancial depth. However , even if one is convinced that private credit is associated with faster poverty reduction, that is not an invitation to policy makers to expand credit freely: attempts to force the rate of nancial deepening through lax monetary policy, for example, will not generate true nancial development and will prove to be unsustainable.

AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 110deregulation over a 20-year period and the fact that the deregulation was not driven by expectations of higher growth or higher entrepreneurial activity allow researchers to perform difference-in-differences estimates, thus holding constant unobserved state-level and year effects. Beck, Levine, and Levkov (2007) exploit the same quasi-natural experiment to assess the effect of branching deregulation on income inequality; they nd that states see their Gini coef cient decrease by a small but statisti- cally signi cant amount in the years after deregulation relative to other states and relative to their own level before the deregulation ( gure 3.2). This effect eliminated about one-sixth of the overall increase in income inequality that the United States experienced over this time period. Over three-quarters of the inequality reduction after deregulation comes from changes in the distribution of income among wage and salary earners, with less than a fth coming from distributional changes among self-employed proprietors, suggesting that the main effect of branch deregulation on income inequality in this case is not enhanced entrepreneurship, but rather the indirect effects of higher labor demand and higher wages.

Nevertheless, these results are consistent with the results obtained by Gin\u00e9 and Townsend (2004) for the effects of nancial liberalization in Thailand. Despite the theoretical possibility that a selective expansion of access to nance could initially worsen income inequality, and methodological challenges notwithstanding (see box 3.3 for a summary), the balance of evidence from speci c quasi-experimental events, estimation of general equilibrium models, and broad cross-country regressions is that nancial development and improved access to credit tends not only to accelerate economic growth but to lower household poverty and inequality. Much remains to be learned about the channels through which nan- cial development affects income inequality and poverty alleviation. Is it through providing access to credit to a larger proportion of the population or through fostering more ef cient capital allocation, that is, through fostering more competitive and open markets? Is it through depth or through broader access that nance helps reduce income inequality and poverty? Given the wide differences that exist in nancial inclusion across countries, to what extent do these effects depend on the initial level of nancial access and economic development? Since the strongest evidence for a favorable nance-inequality rela- tionship points to important labor market effects of nancial deepening and broadening, one must consider whether direct provision of nancial services to the very poor is the best way to use nance to help the poor. Indeed, improving access for small rms and for nonpoor entrepreneurial households can be a powerful mechanism for helping reduce poverty. It is easy to see that nancing opportunities for the nonpoor in particu- lar regions or among particular ethnic groups could help improve the functioning of labor and product markets and the ef ciency of invest- ment, leading to better employment opportunities for the poor in those regions as well. The discussion so far has focused exclusively on the use of credit ser- vices, since that is the nancial service the literature has focused on most extensively. However, credit is rarely the rst nancial service priority for very poor households. Access to savings and insurance services helps cushion income shocks and smooth consumption, while access to formal In summary, improved access to nance reduces inequality and poverty\u2014 \u2014but the nature of the transmission mechanisms is unclear\u2014 \u2014with evidence suggesting that the indirect effects on poverty may be more important Poor households need other nancial services, not just access to credit FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 111 10/26/07 8:40:11 AM 10/26/07 8:40:11 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 112BOTH THE TECHNICAL ADVANCES IN COMPUTING power and the availability of subnational and even household data have helped researchers move beyond cross-country regression analysis to assess the rela-tionship between nance, growth, and inequality and thus overcome problems of endogeneity, hetero-geneity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables across countries, and nonlinear effects. Some of these strategies use innovative his-torical instruments and panel data. However, even employing rm- or household-level data, be it within or across countries, does not by itself solve the iden-ti cation problem of endogeneity and spurious cor- relations, as the debate between Pitt and Khandker (1998) and Morduch (1998) has shown. Identifying an exogenous policy change, preferably at different times across subnational units, overcomes selection problems by utilizing a difference-in-differences esti-mator that holds constant other confounding effects. Two such examples, the social banking experiment in India, and the branching deregulation in the United States, are discussed in the text. However, such quasi-natural experiments are rare, and researchers have therefore also exploited general equilibrium models and household-level micro data to calibrate them. This technique has the advantage of being thoroughly based in theory and control-ling for dynamic effects, unlike regression analysis. At the same time, its application is limited by the variables included in the theoretical models and by the availability of household data. While these structural models are promising in improving the understanding of the micro foundations of growth and inequality, it is not always clear how much the insights from these stylized models rely on speci c details of how the imperfections were modeled and whether the results are robust to these choices. Another valuable approach is the use of controlled or natural experiments in speci c countries or in speci c locations, such as the one undertaken by Karlan and Zinman (2006a) in South Africa and others discussed here in the context of evaluating the impact of micro nance. Of course, natural experi- ments are scarce, and controlled experiments can be costly to implement and their results speci c to their context. In addition, they necessarily measure partial equilibrium effects and, unlike aggregate studies, do not pick up spillover and indirect effects. Furthermore, many important policy issues with implications for nancial access, such as regulation and supervision of nancial institutions, involve country-level variation and do not lend themselves to randomization. F inall y , labo rat o ry experim en ts w o r k wi th potential clients or people with similar pro les and mimic different nancial contract mechanisms. Experimental games have the advantage of allowing researchers to have even more control of events, but they also have the shortcoming of being a staged setting that might or might not be consistent with real life behavior. Given that each methodological approach has its advantages and shortcomings, a robust research philosophy would try to identify the most important policy questions and to employ appropriate and feasible methods for addressing them. Box 3.3 Methodological challenges in analyzing the impact of nancial access payment services is increasingly important in market-based economies. This is an area that requires future research.

The following section discusses FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 112 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 112 10/26/07 8:40:11 AM 10/26/07 8:40:11 AM113HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION institutional and product innovations to reach out to these customers traditionally excluded by the banking system. Providing Financial Access to Households and Microentrepreneurs: How and by Whom? The considerable success of the micro nance movement, both technically and in its ability to mobilize nancial and political support, has focused attention on direct access to credit for poor people and especially for poor women. In what has been an accelerating revolution over the past few decades (Robinson 2001), specialized micro nance institutions have reached millions of clients, and many of them have achieved impres-sive repayment rates, especially when compared with the disappointing record of an earlier generation of development banks. Attention has also broadened to other types of nancial institutions, such as savings banks, including postal savings banks, and nancial cooperatives and credit unions that have also been catering to the nancial needs of low-income households and microenterprises. Now mainstream nancial institutions are becoming interested in the market at the \"bottom of the pyramid,\" to use the term popularized by Prahalad (2004). At the same time, some of the stronger MFIs have secured banking licenses and offer a wider range of services to a broader clientele. Many have graduated beyond the need for sizable subsidies to ensure their nancial viability, whereas others still seek subsidies to help keep the costs to the borrower to a minimum. There has been much experimentation in lending technologies as practitioners nd the various formulas with which they began unduly constraining. These techniques included the use of various forms of mutual guarantee in small or large borrower groups (joint liability), and programs of progressively larger loan sizes as loans were repaid and new loans given (dynamic incentives). To attract savings, nancial institutions of all sorts are using new meth- odologies, such as mobile branches, deposit collectors, and cell phone technology, and developing new products, such as commitment savings products and micro-insurance policies. Against this background, a growing number of researchers has been using formal econometric techniques to assess quantitatively some of the key operational issues that face MFIs and other providers of nancial services to small-scale users. The ndings\u2014several of them striking in The growth of microcredit has attracted new players\u2014 IN EXPANDING ACCESS 114their precision\u2014have used replicable statistical evidence that has either con rmed or questioned practitioner intuition. This section reviews some of the main ndings in ve areas of interest: the relative importance of transaction costs and two key information barriers, moral hazard and adverse selection, for outreach to low-income borrowers; the sensitivity of the demand for microcredit to the level of the interest rate charged; the relative effectiveness of group and individual lending; the complemen-tary role of access to noncredit services; and the link between subsidies and outreach to the poor. While most emphasis is placed on credit, the discussion also highlights the importance of depository, insurance, and especially payments services. Throughout, the discussion emphasizes the potential effects of globalization and technological advances on access to nancial services. It concludes with some observations on the likely welfare implications of targeting efforts to expand household access to the very poor, noting again that access for nonpoor entrepreneurial households can have a sizable antipoverty impact. As alr ead y discussed, th e main p r o b l e ms in d eli v e ring cr edi t ar e linked to risk management and the high transaction costs of processing, monitoring, and enforcing small loans, which increase break-even interest rates for these loans. The risks include those arising out of information asymmetries. These asymmetries can result from adverse selection, that is, the inability of the lender to distinguish between high- and low-risk borrowers, or from moral hazard, that is, the tendency for some borrowers to divert resources to projects that reduce their likelihood of being able to repay the loan and the inability of the lender to detect and prevent such behavior. Depending on the speci c information asymmetry and the ability of potential borrowers to pledge collateral, lenders may try to use the interest rate or a combination of the interest rate and collateral as a screening and sorting mechanism (Bester 1985). If collateral is not available, lenders are forced to rely only on the interest rate, but in doing so, they risk excluding, or crowding out, safe borrowers. Indeed, under some circumstances lenders will prefer to keep the lending rate below the market-clearing level for fear of worsening adverse selection; that behavior in effect rations credit by nonprice means (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981). Even more borrowers will be rationed out if the high transaction costs of lending to them lead to break-even interest rates that are too high to make lending safe (Williamson 1987). How relevant and important are these three factors\u2014adverse selec- tion, moral hazard, and high transaction costs\u2014for credit rationing \u2014despite obstacles to delivering credit to the FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 114 10/26/07 8:40:13 AM 10/26/07 8:40:13 AM115HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION of poor households and microentrepreneurs? The existing evidence points to moral hazard as the driving factor, with a less signi cant role for adverse selection. Although high transaction costs can also result in high repayment burdens, there is evidence of very high rates of return to investment by microentrepreneurs, which explains why some borrowers are prepared to pay very high interest rates. Are the interest rates on microloans too high? Much of the micro - nance revolution has been built on the premise that its clients can afford to pay high interest rates given very high marginal returns on capital. But measuring these returns is challenging. Using eld experiments, de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2006) and McKenzie and Woodruff (2007) estimate capital returns to investment in microenterprises in light manufacturing and commerce in Sri Lanka and Mexico, respectively. The enterprises are given cash or equipment, depending on the outcome of a lottery, and this exogenous shock is used to compute the return to capital. They nd returns of 5-7 percent per month in Sri Lanka and 20 percent or more in Mexico! While these returns might seem high\u2014even unrealistically high in the case of Mexico\u2014they are based on grants, not loans; are measured only over the short term; and increased capital by 25 percent on average. Thus, these returns might not be replicable over the long term. Nor does it follow that the microentrepreneurs would have pursued the same strategies if they had had loans instead of cash or equipment. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest that some microentre-preneurs are indeed able to pay the high interest charged by micro nance institutions, at least where these loan resources are being invested. That is not to deny that high interest rates are costly for borrowers, especially poor ones. In their eagerness to emphasize the importance for the development of sustainable micro nance by removing constraining interest rate ceilings, some advocates may have overstated the insensitivity of borrowers to high interest rates. In contrast, Dehejia, Montgomery, and Morduch (2005), using data from a credit cooperative in Dhaka, and Karlan and Zinman (2007), using data from a South African consumer lender, both nd rather high elasticities of loan demand with respect to interest rates, that is, loan demand decreases as interest rates increase. Emran, Morshed, and Stiglitz (2006) provide a theory to reconcile these empirical ndings with practitioners' oft-repeated assertions that borrowers are insensitive to interest rates. They point to imperfections in the labor market, especially for women, and suggest that it is only for as long as these imperfections prevent women from entering the High returns allow some microentrepreneurs to pay high interest rates\u2014 \u2014but the demand ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 116labor market that their demand for credit will be so interest inelastic. Curiously, the Bangladesh data suggest that the elasticity decreased (in absolute value) with the borrower's income, whereas the South African data suggest the opposite. While MFIs in Bangladesh demanding higher interest rates to compensate for higher costs and risks may face problems reaching out to poorer clients, the South African lender does not seem to face these problems. These contrasting results might refl ect differences between consumer and production credit or different institutional set-tings. Ongoing research is trying to shed more light on the interest rate elasticity of microcredit borrowers. One recent experiment in which interest rates were varied among a homogenous group of borrowers suggests that the repayment burden is the least of the obstacles the borrowers faced. This experiment points to moral hazard, including the inability of the lender to enforce repay-ment from willful defaulters, as the driving factor limiting outreach to the poor. Karlan and Zinman (2006b) used a randomized direct mail offer by a South African consumer lender to distinguish between adverse selection, moral hazard, and repayment burden, as illustrated in gure 3.3. Speci cally, customers were sent credit offers with either Moral hazard may be more important for default rates than repayment burden Figure 3.3 Testing for credit constraints in South Africa Source: Karlan and Zinman (2006b).

Some of the customers with the initial high offer rate then received a lower rate when they responded favorably to the offer, and the difference between customers with the same high initial offer rate (and thus the same ex ante risk pro le) but different nal contract rate helps identify default due to repayment burden of high interest rates (difference between points 1 and 2 in gure 3.3). Finally, some borrowers were offered the prospect of a repeat loan if they repaid their loan in time; the comparison between borrowers with and without this dynamic incentive allows identi cation of moral hazard, that is, incen- tives to repay (difference between points 2 and 3 and between points 4 and 5 in gure 3.3). Karlan and Zinman nd strong evidence for moral hazard but evidence for adverse selection only for female borrowers and borrowers who had not borrowed from this lender before. The evidence for default due to repayment burden is weak. Quantifying the effect of moral hazard, they nd that between 10 and 15 percent of default is due to moral hazard, with the remainder due to observable differences in risk across borrowers. 11 The entry of a Guatemalan MFI into a credit bureau offers another innovative experimental setup to distinguish between adverse selection and moral hazard and yields similar results to those in South Africa (de Janvry, McIntosh, and Sadoulet 2006). While this entry was initially not announced to borrowers, the subsequent staggered education of borrow-ers, who were organized in joint-liability groups, allowed the research-ers to distinguish between moral hazard and adverse selection effects. Speci cally, the initial effect on repayment of the announcement of the existence of the credit bureau helps isolate and identify moral hazard, that is, repayment incentives, as group composition is constant in the short run. Subsequent changes in group composition and the effect of those changes on repayment, on the other hand, can be attributed to adverse selection, that is, selection of lower-risk group members. The authors nd that delinquency attributable to moral hazard declined 18 percent. Reductions in delinquency resulting from changes in adverse selection, that is, replacement of high-risk with low-risk group members, as measured over several loan cycles where groups can adjust their com-position, are weaker, but still present. The most signi cant change in group composition was a large exit of women and corresponding large Adverse selection problems might be more pronounced among female borrowers FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 117 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 117 10/26/07 8:40:14 AM 10/26/07 8:40:14 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 118entry of men, suggesting again that adverse selection problems might be more pronounced among female borrowers. Summarizing, many microentrepreneurs are able to pay high interest rates given high returns on capital. Therefore, the high transaction costs associated with small loans, the resulting high interest rates, and thus the higher repayment burden do not seem to be obstacles to reaching poor households. Rather, outreach to these groups is impeded by the inability of poor borrowers to commit the use of loan resources to projects with a risk acceptable to the lender and by the inability of lenders to enforce repayment. The inability of lenders to distinguish between good and bad credit risks before making the loan is also an obstacle, but less so. The research reviewed so far, however, points to two techniques that can be used to overcome these barriers\u2014joint-liability lending and dynamic incentives through repeat lending. Joint-Liability Lending and Dynamic Incentives The use of joint-liability groups is a traditional tool to overcome the hurdles of adverse selection, moral hazard, and monitoring and enforce-ment costs. Joint liability can reduce all three of these barriers to lend-ing, but there are trade-offs (see Ghatak and Guinnane 1999 for an overview). By pooling borrowers that know each other well and making them jointly liable for each others' loan repayment, the lender effectively outsources the screening and monitoring function. Through assortative matching\u2014safe (risky) borrowers will join with other safe (risky) bor-rowers\u2014the lender can screen borrowers by the company they keep. Joint-liability lending reduces monitoring and enforcement costs and thus allows lower interest rates. These lower rates reduce the repayment burden and result in less credit rationing. Most important, lower moni-toring costs and strong enforcement through social sanctions can reduce moral hazard problems in joint-liability credit contracts if borrowers decide cooperatively on project choices. However, joint-liability lending can also induce strategic default; if good borrowers see the prospect of future loans wane because other group members are not repaying their loans, they have fewer incentives to repay (Besley and Coate 1995). Further, joint-liability lending is not suitable where different members of the group have different borrowing needs. Joint-liability lending was already being applied by German coopera- tives in the 19th century. Introduced into the micro nance movement Overcoming obstacles\u2014 joint-liability lending and dynamic AM 10/26/07 8:40:15 AM119HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION in the 1980s by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, joint-liability lending quickly became popular with pioneer microcredit institutions. Given its limitations, however, many MFIs, including Grameen itself, have moved away from a pure joint-liability lending model and now also offer indi-vidual loans. The limitations of relying on just one lending model are also refl ected in the results of recent eld research, especially some studies that have made very effective use of randomized control trials (box 3.4). How important are reductions in adverse selection, moral hazard, or monitoring and enforcement costs for the success of joint-liability MEASURING THE IMPACT OF NEW MICROFINANCE programs or products requires careful design because standard assessments comparing customers before and after introduction of a new program or product or a comparison between participants and nonparticipants suffer from two serious shortcom-ings (Goldberg and Karlan 2005). First, selection bias can occur if there is a correlation between the take-up decision of customers and other individual characteristics that explain the outcome variable. Further, dropouts can bias the comparison between program participants and nonparticipants. Second, such assessments suffer from a lack of a proper counterfactual, that is, how the same group of cli-ents would have behaved without the new program or product. To overcome these methodological challenges, researchers are increasingly using randomized exper-iments to assess new micro nance programs and products. The characteristics of these experiments can be summarized as follows. First, the evaluation has to be prospective; in other words, it has to start before the new product is introduced so that the changes induced by the product can be properly assessed. Second, to have a proper counterfactual, the evaluation should be based on comparison of a treatment and a control group, where only the rst has access to the new program or product. Third, assignment to either group has to be random to ensure that clients in both groups have the same characteristics; only then can the effects of the new program or product be isolated. Fourth, the research-ers have to take into account two potential spillover effects: experiment spillover, where members of treatment and control groups nd out about each other; and impact spillover, where the effects of the new program or product spread to people and areas beyond the treatment group. Although they have limitations, carefully planned and executed impact evaluations are a powerful instrument both for individual nancial institutions that want to assess the pro tability and impact of new products and programs and for policy makers who want to assess which interventions are the most promising in reducing poverty. A signi cant short- coming is the high costs of such evaluations, which prevent many MFIs from using them (Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch 2005). In addition, the question of external validity\u2014whether the results of the evaluation are applicable in different socio-economic and institutional contexts\u2014cannot be addressed with such experiments. A nal word of caution concerns the use of these impact evaluations for public policy or public resources. Because no counterfactual or alternative intervention is being evaluated, either in the nancial sector or for non nancial interventions, one has to keep in mind the partial equilibrium aspect of these assessments. Box 3.4 Testing impact with randomized control trials FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 119 8:40:15 AND IN EXPANDING ACCESS 120lending? Gin\u00e9 and others (2006) nd in the setting of laboratory experi- ments in Peru that both the screening of group members before the loan is made and the monitoring of borrowers afterward have an important role in the success of joint-liability lending. 12 However, they also nd that joint liability helps reduce moral hazard only when the group forms voluntarily. Using household data across members of more than 262 Thai joint-liability groups, Ahlin and Townsend (2007) nd that informal sanctioning, thus ex post reductions in moral hazard, ts the data best in poor rural areas, while ex ante screening, thus reducing the risk of adverse selection, ts the data best in more affl uent areas. The importance of moral hazard reductions through joint-liability lending is con rmed with evidence from poor rural Peru, where Karlan (2007) exploited a natural quasi-random group-building process, where members were randomly assigned to groups rather than selecting their peer group members themselves. He nds that stronger social connec- tions between group members (as measured by geographic proximity and common ethnicity) lead to better repayment and higher savings than for groups where social connections are weaker. Given the absence of peer selection in this group-building process, Karlan concludes that the better repayment behavior is attributable to reductions in moral hazard; in other words, joint-liability groups that were more socially connected were better able to prevent their members from diverting loan funds to risky projects or other purposes. 13 He nds direct evidence that members of groups with better social connections have better knowledge of each other and are more likely to punish defaulters by cutting relationships; however, they are also more likely to forgive debt, suggesting that peers in these groups know how to distinguish between culpable or blameworthy default on the one hand, and bad luck on the other. However, some evidence suggests that social ties can be too strong, lead- ing to collusion and lower repayment. Ahlin and Townsend (2007) nd evidence in their Thai data that stronger social ties, measured by more shar-ing between unrelated members of the groups and clustering of relatives, are associated with lower repayment performance. Similarly, Gin\u00e9 and others (2006) nd in their laboratory experiment that communication between group members leads to higher default due to riskier investments. Existing evidence thus clearly shows that group-based joint-liability lending can, but does not necessarily, lead to better repayment performance. Yet recent evidence has also shed doubt on the superiority of group-based lending vis-\u00e0-vis individual lending.

Gin\u00e9 and Karlan (2006) found that conversion to individual liability groups does not change the repayment rate for preexist-ing borrowers but does attract more borrowers. Perhaps surprisingly, the new members have closer links to the other individual liability borrowers, suggesting that fear of peer pressure might have been limiting growth of existing joint-liability groups. It could also be that the joint-liability nature of the program was keeping the good-risk borrowers out of the program. Ongoing research is trying to distinguish between new microcredit clients that are randomly assigned to either individual or joint-liability lending. Some observers have criticized MFIs for making larger loans to indi- viduals, complaining that the MFIs are drifting from their focus on the poor. Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Morduch (2007) examined data from 124 MFIs in 49 countries and nd that both group- and individual-based lending institutions are able to earn pro ts while serving the poor, but a trade-off between pro tability and outreach emerges when serving the very poor. 14 Individual-based lenders have the highest average pro t levels but perform less well on measures of outreach. To summarize, joint-liability lending can help overcome barriers to reaching poor households and microentrepreneurs and has shown its usefulness in many different settings, but it also has its limitations. As members' borrowing needs diverge over time, conversion to individual lending might be necessary. Further, diverging borrowing needs might also destroy screening and monitoring incentives and may create tension among borrowers, as those borrowing little are still liable for the larger amounts of their peers. Finally, joint liability can result in collusion and increased, rather than reduced, risk taking. Dynamic incentives, such as the promise of repeat lending, have been another mechanism to overcome moral hazard in lending rela-tionships with risky and high transaction cost borrowers, as shown by Karlan and Zinman (2006b) in the context of their work with a South African consumer lender. Similarly, Gin\u00e9 and others (2006) nd that giving borrowers the prospect of repeat loans reduces both the riskiness of investment and improves repayment performance. The introduc-tion of progressive lending, that is, increasing loan amounts over time, can further increase the opportunity costs of default for borrowers, thus reducing loan delinquency (Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch 2005). 15 The interaction of joint liability and repeat lending, however, can also back re; if borrowers see the prospect of future loans wane Overcoming moral hazard through the promise of repeat lending\u2014 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 121 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 122INFORMAL FINANCE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF THIS report, which deals essentially with formal nance. To be sure, informal nancial services still do rep- resent a signi cant part of the nancial dealings of poor people, especially but not only in developing countries, although reliable quanti cation on this point is not readily available. An extensive literature discusses this area (see Rutherford 1998). The reason for focusing on formal nance is the underlying premise that formal, modern nance can potentially provide most of the nancial services needed by poor people with greater ef ciency and security than informal nance (see box 2.2). Formal nance has not yet superseded informal nance largely because the current working practices of for-mal nancial intermediaries are not adapted to pro- viding services in small packets at a cost that makes them affordable to the poor. Technology\u2014 nancial and physical\u2014as well as an improved overall infra-structure, can help bring costs down to realistic levels, but only if the management of formal institutions chooses to focus on the potential for doing pro table business with what C. K. Prahalad has termed the \"bottom of the pyramid.\" Prahalad's image conveys the potential volume of small-scale business, which can make it attractive even if the setup costs (required to achieve low unit costs) are high. At th e sam e tim e, man y features o f info rmal nance convey lessons that can and have been suc- cessfully adopted and adapted by formal and semi-formal intermediaries. Scholars have in particular been fascinated by the durability of rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs), one of the most striking forms of informal nancial intermediary (see, for example, Ghatak and Guinnane 1999). Regular payments by each member and assignment of the collected resources to one member help over-come savings and credit constraints, reduce problems of cash management and storage, and allow members to realize large investments, be they for consump-tion or business purposes. The use of social capital and peer pressure that holds ROSCAs together and reduces the threat of default by individual members has important parallels to the use of joint-liability lending by many MFIs. But ROSCAs cannot hope to match the scale of resources of the formal nancial system, with its ability to pool risks and intermediate over extended periods and across geographic areas. Hawala and other ethnically based international money transfer businesses have achieved astonishing ef ciencies for payments along certain migration corridors. Corresponding small payments made through the banking system's procedures have gener-ally been more costly and slower, though of course the banking system's procedures are scalable and the network of correspondents is essentially universal, as are the networks of the major formal international money transmission companies. Funeral insurance arrangements are a common product of community-based informal insurance associations, especially in AIDS-plagued Africa. Th e high cost o f credi t fro m info rmal m o n - eylenders is often cited as a main reason why the micro nance revolution can bring bene ts to the poor (Robinson 2001). The possibility of providing alternative formal nancial solutions for those who might otherwise fall into the trap of debt bondage is for many a suf cient reason to emphasize the need for improving the reach of the formal nan- cial sector. Yet unregistered (and therefore usually) illegal moneylenders continue to operate in deprived neighborhoods of even the richest economies (as is discussed in chapter 4). The shortcomings of infor-mal nance mean that it will fade in importance as economies and nancial systems mature and improve in their outreach. Box 3.5 Informal nance FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 122 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION as other members fail to repay, their incentives to repay decrease. The Ecuad o rian mi cr o l e n d e r Chil dr each is an exam p l e: as rum o rs o f i ts impending failure spread, the microlender faced a rapid increase in loan delinquency (Bond and Rai 2002). Other mechanisms linked to the microcredit movement have not been thoroughly assessed yet. Speci cally, frequent (weekly, for example) and regular repayments are said to impose discipline on borrowers. On the one hand, repayment schedules that are too frequent might limit the investment opportunities of borrowers and are useful only for borrowers with several diversi ed income sources. Some observers even claim that frequent repayment schedules are paid out of savings rather than from returns on investment (Rutherford 1998). In those cases, providing credit services is only a second-best solution, and the rst-best would be the provision of savings services for the poor. On the other hand, frequent repayment might also be a tool of MFIs to use better informed informal lenders, inasmuch as some borrowers have to rely on these moneylenders to help them make weekly payments (Jain and Mansuri 2003). Some other microlending techniques include repayment in public, forced savings, notional collateral, and targeting of women. Public repay-ment is said to increase social pressure and the threat of stigma, while at the same time reducing transaction costs for lenders (Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch 2005). The requirement to keep a certain frac-tion of the credit as savings with the micro nance institution has often been cited as a success factor, although the practice has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. The use of assets with \"notional\" rather than resale or salvage value, such as refrigerators and televisions, has often been quoted as increasing the leverage of the lender over the borrower and augmenting payment discipline. Finally, the targeting of women by microlenders has been indicated as a factor for commercial success as well as enhanced social bene t (box 3.6). Most of the microcredit movement and literature has focused on production credit for household enterprises or microenterprises. But even if lack of nancing is fundamentally the only constraint for poor micro- entrepreneurs, as is asserted by Muhamed Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank an d winn e r o f th e 2006 N o bel P eace P rize, th ey d o also face numerous practical challenges. Hence some MFIs have decided to offer complementary extension services, such as training or health services. Are they wise to do so? There could be economies of scope in providing these different services, but there might also be bene ts of specialization. \u2014frequent repayment schedules\u2014 \u2014and AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 124Karlan and Valdivia (2006), and Ashraf, Gin\u00e9 and, Karlan (2007) nd that MFIs that offer extension services have higher client retention and better repayment performance than MFIs that do not offer such services. Their clients also have better business outcomes. Even the limited focus on production credit might be mistaken. Recent analysis of survey data from Indonesia suggests MFI clients use credit as much for consumption as for investment purposes (Johnston and Morduch 2007). This nding applies not only to households that do not run microenterprises but even to a quarter of microentrepreneur households ( gure 3.4). As discussed earlier, consumer credit is also the THE MICROCREDIT MOVEMENT HAS FOCUSED on women, with some programs providing services exclusively for women and others having a majority of female borrowers. Why this focus on women? First, women traditionally face greater access barriers to formal banking services and are thus also credit-constrained to a greater extent than men. In some countries, women are legally barred from opening accounts or applying for credit. In most of the developing world, women would not be deemed creditworthy since they do not hold formal sector jobs or the titles to their houses. Many restrictions faced by the poor in the developing world are thus even more exacerbated for women. As discussed by Emran, Moshed, and Stiglitz (2006), women also ha v e l o w er o p po rtuni ty costs if th ey d o n o t hold formal sector jobs and are thus more likely to pay the high interest rates required for sustainable micro nance. Second, experience has shown that repayment is higher among female borrowers, mostly due to more conservative investments and lower moral hazard risk. The lower moral hazard risk might stem from lower mobility and higher risk aversion. Given that moral hazard seems to be the constraining factor in outreach to low-income households, women might therefore be the more attractive clients. While adverse selection might be more problematic among women, the joint-liability technique can control for this risk. Third, some practitioners stress social objec- tives as women seem to be more concerned about children's health and education than their husbands. As already discussed, Pitt and Khandker (1998) and Khandker (2003) nd a stronger effect of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh on female than on male borrow-ers. For example, Khandker (2003) shows that the impact of credit on nonfood expenditures is higher among female compared to male borrowers. Finally, focusing on women might empower them in the intrafamily decision process, as shown by Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006b); use of a com-mitment savings product increased expenditures on female durable goods. Similarly, access to credit and the subsequent establishment of a microenterprise might give women more say in intrahousehold deci-sions, as Johnson and Morduch (2007) illustrates with some anecdotes from Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, and Zambia. Providing access to nancial services for female savers and borrowers might thus directly contribute to the Millennium Development Goal of gender equality (box 3.1). For a detailed discussion of gender and credit, see Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch (2005, chapter 7). Box 3.6 Micro nance and gender 124 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 8:40:19 AM125HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION only credit type shown to be robustly linked with higher household wel- fare (Karlan and Zinman 2006b). This is not a negative outcome, but it does suggest a very different vision of micro nance from the original. In addition to the reluctance of traditional lenders to reach out to low-income households and microentrepreneurs, risk-averse producers might be reluctant to take up loans. While credit- nanced microenter- prise might increase the level of income, it might also increase its varia-tion. Indeed, in their survey Johnston and Morduch (2007) nd a large group of households that do not want credit although they are deemed creditworthy by of cials of a microcredit institution. While research on a randomly chosen sample of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka nds credit constraints are the main reason for the lack of expanding business, not missing insurance markets (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2006), take-up of credit might be increased if coupled with a proper insurance mechanism. This might be especially true for agricultural producers who are subject to high price and yield volatility.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 126Insurance products with or without credit might thus help these farm- ers expand without taking on too much additional risk. Traditional insurance to farmers to protect them against climatic and other shocks has proved costly and unmarketable because of high moral hazard risk from misreporting. As an alternative, insurers have developed weather index insurance, which compensates farmers according to objectively veri able benchmarks likely to be correlated with the actual damage the farmer has suffered. How successful are such insurance schemes? Gin\u00e9, Townsend, and Vickery (2007) assess the introduction of a rainfall insurance product, rst designed by a large insurance company in southern India in 2004 and marketed by a micro nance institution. In villages where policies were sold, the authors nd that less than 5 percent of the targeted popula- tion buys the insurance product and less than 3 percent of the purchasers change their production patterns. Why such low uptake of the product? The most common reason given for not buying the insurance, accord-ing to Gin\u00e9, Townsend, and Vickery (2007), is lack of understanding of the product. The cost of insurance combined with credit constraints constitute another powerful factor explaining the lack of take-up. Lack of trust that the insurer would pay claims promptly or at all if the insurable event occurs is likely also a factor\u2014not unwarranted given the experi-ence with many nancial innovations in low-income environments in the past. Overall, it seems the insurance product did not reach the most vulnerable households that would bene t most from it. In a similar experiment in Malawi, farmers were randomly offered the choice between a simple credit contract or one that combined credit with insurance (Gin\u00e9 and Yang 2007). The latter is effectively a contingent credit contract, that is, a loan that has to be repaid only in good times. Surprisingly, the take-up of the credit-insurance contract was signi cantly lower than the take-up of the credit contract, and the difference cannot be explained by the cost of including insurance. Unlike microcredit, microinsurance products are still in their infancy, so it is too early to draw de nite conclusions. But this research shows the substantial barriers that providers have to overcome to market the product effectively to the target population. Rainfall insurance is only one of the microinsurance products that have been developed over the past years. Life and health insurance poli-cies are increasingly offered by both commercial and nongovernmental organization (NGO) insurance institutions. For such policies to be viable FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 126 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 126 10/26/07 8:40:20 AM 10/26/07 8:40:20 AM127HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION for a commercial insurer, there needs to be a delivery channel with which potential clients are familiar, such as an MFI or an NGO (as in the two cases discussed). While a large practitioners' literature discusses these different products and delivery mechanisms, rigorous research assessing their impact is still to be conducted. 16 To what extent do poor households really need credit? In the absence of credit, the poor might simply accumulate savings over time before investing and thus overcome credit constraints. If they are too poor t o accum ula t e sa vings, access t o cr edi t can im p r o v e th e ir in co m es, although poor households might run the risk of overindebtedness. Dale Adams and others argue that better savings vehicles, not what they call \"microdebt,\" are the nancial service most needed by most of the poor: rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) and microcredit are thus seen as imperfect tools to address savings constraints (Adams and von Pischke 1992; Rutherford 1998). This school also argues that despite popular beliefs to the contrary, the fact that the poor are capable of weekly repayments shows that the poor are capable of saving, even if it is only in small amounts (Rutherford 1998). Why are poor households less likely to save in monetary forms, that is, through the banking system, than other households? One constraint is certainly the geographic distance to bank outlets. A large share of the poor population in many developing countries is still concentrated in rural areas, and banking systems in developing countries typically concentrate their branch network in urban areas. That geographic access can matter for monetary savings is shown by the analysis of a pseudo-natural experiment in Mexico. Speci cally , Aportela (1 999) analyzed the results of the expansion of a government-owned Mexican savings institute in the early 1990s. This expansion happened only in some states, and there seems to be no signi cant correlation of state characteristics with the expansion programs. Computing savings rates of low-income households from survey responses before and after the expansion started, Aportela shows that the expansion increased the savings rate of low-income households\u2014the ones targeted by the expansion in the rst place\u2014but had no effect on high-income households. In addition, the increased nancial savings did not seem to crowd out other informal ways of savings: there was a positive net effect on the overall savings of the typical household. The importance of geographic proximity points to local savings banks and post of ce networks as important tools for attracting savings \u2014and microsavings Geographic distance is an important barrier to savings for many households FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 127 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 127 10/26/07 8:40:20 AM 10/26/07 8:40:20 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 128by low-income households. In 1 9th century Germany , municipalities established local savings banks to do just that. The fact that almost all adults in most countries in continental western Europe have checking or savings accounts is often attributed to the dense networks of savings and cooperative banks. Similarly, postal savings banks have traditionally played an important role in the rural and more remote areas of many developed and developing countries, despite their often weak nancial structure and suboptimal service provision. Lack of geographic access is not the only impediment to saving in mon- etary form, however. Time inconsistency problems\u2014short-run impatience (high discount factors in the near future) and long-run patience (low dis-count factors in the far future)\u2014could explain why many individuals often regret how little they have saved. Confl icts within households over savings can also result in undersaving. In developing countries as in developed, a variety of commitment devices are used to help overcome such problems. Indeed, some of the practices of the informal ROSCAs can be rationalized in this way. Micro nance institutions around the world offer a wide variety of savings commitment devices for their clients (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2003). But do these commitment devices work in increasing savings? Do they infl uence intrahousehold decision processes and consumption-savings patterns? Several recent papers assess these questions. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006b, c) assess the effect of a commitment product where savers commit to forgo their access to savings accounts until a speci c date or until they have reached a precommitted balance. Speci cally, the authors conducted an experiment by randomly giving half of 1,800 existing or former clients of a rural Philippine bank the option to save through a commitment savings account (a locked box) that allowed them access to the funds only after they reached a self-set date or a self-set amount of savings. Only 28 percent of clients decided to take up this product, but Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin nd an increase of 81 percent in average savings balances of account holders who participated in the scheme over a 12-month period. This effect was not sustained, however; after 30 months the average balance was only 33 percent higher than the average balance of nonparticipants and the difference was no longer signi cant; many clients stopped saving with the commitment product after an initial period. At the same time, this commitment device led to a shift in the power of decision making by women, which was seen in higher investment in durable goods associated with women, such as washing and sewing machines and kitchen appliances. Commitment devices may encourage savings FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 128 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 128 10/26/07 8:40:21 AM 10/26/07 8:40:21 AM129HOUSEHOLD TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006a) assess the effect of another technique to attract savings, designed to overcome both the problem of geographic distance and the lack of commitment, namely, door-to-door collection of savings. Among those who did take up this service, savings increased by 25 percent over a 15-month period, while borrowing went down; it is possible that savings, rather than borrowing, were thus used for con-sumption smoothing. Households accepting this service lived farther away from the nearest bank branch, thus indicating the importance of travel costs; and they were more likely to be married, again showing the importance of intrahousehold confl icts in the savings decision. The fact that the offer of a convenient savings instrument reduced borrowing is yet more evidence for those who interpret microcredit take-up as a sur-rogate solution in the absence of savings opportunities. Geographic impediments and intrahousehold confl icts are only some of the barriers poor people face in accessing savings services offered by nancial institutions, as discussed in chapter 1. Continuing research in Indonesia is exploring other dimensions such as barriers related to affordability and nancial literacy. While access to nancial services, such as credit or savings services, has received a great deal of attention in recent years, access to payments services has generated even more attention. Increased globalization has heightened demand for these services. International remittances, funds earned by migrants abroad and sent to their families in developing coun-tries, have grown so dramatically in recent years that they have become the second largest source of external nance for developing countries after foreign direct investment ( gure 3.5). 17 Moreover, a large share of the population in developing countries receives remittances. Relative to private capital fl ows, remittance fl ows tend to be relatively stable and countercyclical, that is, they increase in times of crisis. Technological advances have also become important for remittance fl ows, as the increas- ing trend to send remittances through ATMs and cell phones shows. Remittances sent through formal channels are commonly subject to high costs. These high costs drive many remittance senders to informal remittance agencies. Furthermore, the costs of sending remittances have important implications for the amount of remittances sent. Yang (2007) shows that Philippine migrants sent lower remittances in foreign cur-rency when the Philippine peso depreciated, suggesting that they want their families to receive a xed amount in pesos. Gibson, McKenzie, and Rohorua (2006) show a negative cost elasticity for Tonga of 0.22; Demand for payments services has increased FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 129 10/26/07 8:40:21 AM 10/26/07 8:40:21 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 130if the cost of sending the remittances were reduced to levels in more competitive markets around the world, they compute an increase of 28 percent in remittances\u2014an amount that would constitute 4 percent of Tonga's GDP. A lack of bank competition and nancial underdevelopment seem to explain the high costs of formal remittances. The typical remittance fee is priced as a two-part tariff, consisting of a xed fee regardless of the amount sent, and a variable fee arising from the exchange rate commis-sion. As a result, the average fee for sending remittances decreases as the remittance amount increases, so the small amounts that are typically sent are subject to high costs. But remittance costs vary signi cantly across corridors. The decrease in fees in the U.S.-Mexico corridor, for example, has been attributed to a higher degree of competition in the remittance market (Hernandez-Coss 2005). In the Tonga-New Zealand corridor, where competition is minimal and migrants lack information about available options, the fees are three times as high as in the U.S.-Mexico Figure 3.5 Remittance fl ows across countries Source: World Bank (2005, World Development Indicators ).

The example of Tonga also illustrates an important factor explaining high remittance costs: lack of bank penetration not only reduces competition but also makes remittances more expensive if the alternative money transfer operators have only indirect access (through banks) to the payment system. Tonga provides just one example of how expanded access to modern technologies can help. Technology can make business processes more ef cient for nancial institutions as well as increase access possibilities for customers. Technological advances can reduce the costs of bank-ing, effectively enabling outreach further down the income pyramid to customers with demand for smaller transaction amounts. 18 For example, payment systems based on electronic fund transfers rather than checks can substantially reduce the costs of payment transfers. Cell-phone-based nancial transactions (also referred to as m-banking or m- nance, with the m standing for mobile phone) have gained prominence in recent years. There are more cell-phone users in Sub-Saharan Africa than holders of bank accounts, and the use of cell phones for nancial transactions has increased rapidly in recent years. How far this technology can go in pushing out the access frontier is still subject to debate, however. Porteous (2006) nds that use of m-banking services in South Africa is predominantly concentrated among existing bank customers, with only a few providers targeting those without accounts. Technology can also affect customers directly. The introduction of ATMs has not only increased accessibility of accounts to 24 hours a day, thus improving convenience, but has also expanded the range of customers. Financial institutions in several Sub-Saharan African countries have introduced transaction accounts that are purely ATM based; customers do not have to enter banking halls, a cultural barrier for many Africans without bank accounts. Providing nancial services through ATMs is also cheaper for the nancial institution. And by encouraging channeling of payments such as remittances through the formal banking system, technological advances may broaden the deposit base of banks, allowing them to intermediate more funds to the private sector. If the banks can learn over time about their clients and their creditworthiness, including remittance recipients in the formal banking system as depositors, at least some of those customers may become borrowers. Receiving remittances through the formal banking system thus might enable recipients to gain access to other nancial services as well. Two recent studies show that remittance fl ows pull new \u2014can be overcome with technology Technology can also expand the customer base FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 131 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 131 10/26/07 8:40:22 AM 10/26/07 8:40:22 ALL?

Combining municipality- level and household survey data for Mexico, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and others (2007) nd a positive relationship between the share of households in a municipality that receives remittances and total deposits to GDP, deposit accounts per capita, and branches per capita, but no signi cant relationship with total credit to GDP. Using household survey data for El Salvador, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Martinez Peria (2007) nd evidence that channeling remittances through the banking system increases banking outreach; the likelihood that the recipient has a bank account is twice as high if the remittances are received through the banking system than if they are received through informal channels, although there is no effect on the credit side. 19 REMITTANCES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY important in Tonga, where they constitute more than 30 percent of GDP and account for 20 percent of monetary household income (Gibson, McKenzie, and Rohorua 2006) Despite their importance, the transaction costs of sending remittances to Tonga by the most widely used methods are high. Typical transactions costs average 15-20 percent of the remittance amount for bank drafts, telegraphic transfers through banks, transactions through Western Union, and transactions through Melie mei Langi, a church-based money transfer operation. In contrast, transferring money through an ATM card linked to a New Zealand bank account set up by the sender costs less than 5 percent, but this method is not widely used. The cost spread between the more popular methods and ATMs means a potential loss for Tonga equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. What accounts for the underuse of ATMs? Gibson and others (2006) use a survey among Tongan immigrants in New Zealand to explore this puzzle. First, the immigrants seem to lack knowledge: only 2 percent of those surveyed knew how to use an ATM to send money, and few knew of the hidden ex change rate p remi ums that in crease th e cost o f other methods. Second, distance of recipients from an ATM in Tonga outside the capital city of Nuku'alofa limits access to this method. The gure below shows the coverage areas of ATM machines and Western Union outlets on the main island of Tongatapu. Although there are more ATMs than Western Union outlets, the ATMs are concentrated in Nuku'alofa, and cover only 77 percent of the population within a 10 kilometer radius, whereas Western Union reaches 97 percent of that population. Finally, three-quarters of respondents indicated they would not use ATMs as a method of remitting because they did not trust them, fearing unauthorized withdrawals and card skimming among other things. This analysis suggests several ways for nancial sector policy to improve both the demand for and supply of newer and cheaper remittance technolo-gies. In particular, more attention needs to be given to improving the nancial literacy of migrants and Box 3.7 Why don't migrants use the cheapest methods?

Thirty years after the establishment of Grameen Bank, the micro nance movement has attained a certain maturity. Micro nance increases access to nancial services for those participating in the program, and, because of lower staff salaries and lack of posh banking halls, it does so at lower operating costs than commercial banks can. Nonetheless, most micro nance programs still incur high unit costs because of the small size of loans. As a result, a large proportion of the institutions\u2014albeit mostly the smaller ones\u2014are dependent on subsidies (Robinson 2001; Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch 2005), and there is a continuing discussion about the nancial sustainability of microcredit, regarding both its feasibility and desirability. Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Morduch providing them with clear and accurate informa- tion about the alternatives available for remitting.

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 134(2007) looked at a sample of 124 MFIs in 49 countries representing around 50 percent of all micro nance clients around the globe, most likely, the more pro table and cost-ef cient institutions. The authors nd that even in this select group, only half of the institutions were pro table and nancially self-sustainable, generating suf cient revenue to cover their costs ( gure 3.6). One of the reasons for this lack of self-sustainability might be the lack of scale; only in eight countries do micro nance borrowers account for more than 2 percent of the population (Honohan 2004, gure 3.7), and most individual MFIs seem to be too small to reap the necessary scale economies to become nancially sustainable ( gure 3.8). At the same time, as MFIs grow and mature, they seem to focus less on the poor (Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Morduch 2007), which could be interpreted either as a success story for their borrowers or as mission drift. Micro nance also suffers from another important limitation: for many MFIs, scaling up to nonpoor customers will be dif cult, as will be the ability of MFIs to accompany their customers as they grow richer. Joint-liability lending relies on groups of borrowers with similar borrowing needs, and the pro tability of the approach relies on large numbers of \u2014raising questions about sustainability Figure 3.6 Financial self-suf ciency and subsidy dependence Source: Cull, This nancial self-sustainability (ability to generate suf cient revenue to cover costs) of 124 MFIs across 49 countries, with the blue bars indicating MFIs in the top 2 5 th percen tiles in subsidy dependence (given by share of subsidies as a proportio n of total liabilities plus equity).MFIs in the top quartile of subsidy dependence ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION Figure 3.7 Micro nance penetration across countries Source: Honohan (2004).

The higher borrowers are on the income ladder and the larger the size of the enterprise, however, the more divergent are borrower characteristics and borrowing needs. Not surprisingly, loans made by individual-based microlending institutions are larger on aver-age than loans made by MFIs using joint-liability lending. Furthermore, larger average loan sizes also imply lower costs (Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Morduch 2007). MFIs in most cases do not have suf cient resources to ful ll the bor- rowing needs of larger microenterprises. And microenterprises might no longer be willing and able to pay the higher MFI interest rates as they expand. MFIs are constrained by the lack of savings mobilization and their reliance on donor resources. Especially in developing coun-tries, only the formal banking system has suf cient resources to ful ll the borrowing needs of their economies' private sectors. The obvious solution\u2014linking the microcredit sector with the banking sector\u2014has therefore become an increasingly popular solution. In several countries, such as Bolivia and Uganda, MFIs have been given the opportunity to convert into microbanks and collect deposits from the general public. Some of the leading micro nance institutions have received equity fund- ing from institutional investors, and links between banks and MFIs in numerous countries have provided MFIs with the necessary funding from banks, while maintaining their business and credit model to target low-income clients. 20 Many MFIs, even with subsidies, have had trouble reaching the very poor. And, as mentioned, some MFIs have been moving upscale with their successful clients. Should policymakers worry about an apparent drift in the emphasis of many MFIs, and of the MFI industry as a whole, a wa y fr o m f ocus ing o n cr edi t access f o r th e v e ry poo r? Co ns i d e ring the indications that improving access for not-so-poor entrepreneurial households can have powerfully favorable indirect implications for the poor, such worries may be overstated. Focusing on nance for the very poor shifts the attention to subsidies and charity, which can hurt the quality of services. There are also good political economy reasons why the focus should not be on the poor or on how micro nance can be made more viable, but instead on how nancial services can be made available for all. 21 The poor lack the political clout to demand better services, and subsidies may spoil the credit culture, that is, the willingness to repay loans since they are perceived as grants. De ning the issue more broadly to include the middle class, who often MFIs often are unable to meet the needs of the excluded nonpoor A narrow focus on the poor may be counterproductive\u2014 136 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION also lack access, would make it more likely that policy makers would make nancial access a priority. Hence shifting the focus to building inclusive nancial systems and improving access for all underserved groups is likely to have greater impact on development outcomes. As a result, the development community has shifted its attention to building inclusive nancial systems focusing not only on specialized microcredit institutions, but on an array of other nancial institutions, such as postal savings banks, consumer credit institutions, and, most important, the banking system. This broader approach can lead to overall nancial system ef ciency and outreach to the whole population. The recent expansion in banking services across Latin America, for example, has been driven by consumer credit, provided mostly by util-ity and other non nancial companies, such as large department stores. Although no rm data exist, anecdotal evidence suggests that this credit expansion is based on credit scoring and risk diversi cation through the law of large numbers. Postal networks have come to play an increasingly important role, such as in Brazil, where the postal service linked with a private commercial bank through an agency agreement, thus effectively increasing geographic access to banking services to all municipalities. Private commercial banks have taken the lead in reaching out to low-income households and microenterprises with new techniques and prod-ucts, often driven by a combination of pro t and social objectives. The broader focus on an inclusive nancial system raises again the question of how to ensure that nancial institutions will expand outreach. How can governments and donors best help reduce transaction costs and risk that often impede commercially oriented nancial institutions from reaching out to the poor and near poor? Should donors subsidize micro nance institutions so they can reach out to the very poor? Should the government subsidize nancial institutions so they reach out to rural and remote areas? Several ideas and questions arise in this context. 22 First, subsidies in the nancial sector have to be assessed in a rigor- ous manner to compare costs and bene ts with subsidies in other areas, such as education or infrastructure. Any subsidy has the opportunity costs of forgone government intervention in other sectors and areas. Second, a distinction has to be made between credit services, on the one hand, and savings and payments services, on the other hand. More of a case might be made for subsidies in payment services, because such services are considered necessary for participation in a modern market economy. Further, payment services can be seen as a network good whose \u2014highlighting the need to foster the development of a range of nancial institutions\u2014 \u2014and carefully assess whether subsidies could more effectively be used in other areas FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 137 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 137 10/26/07 8:40:26 AM 10/26/07 8:40:26 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 138bene ts increase as a larger proportion of the population has access to an d uses th em (Claessens an d o th ers 200 3). Thir d, su bs i di es sh o ul d focus on overcoming the barriers to access rather than distorting prices, such as interest rates. Finally, technological advances have the potential to revolutionize access for the poor, shifting attention from subsidies to establishing an environment conducive to technological innovations that may help overcome many of the restrictions. However, these technological advances, such as m- nance, also pose important regulatory questions. To what extent should electronic and m- nance providers be considered nancial institutions and thus be subject to the heavier regulatory and supervisory framework? This issue is discussed further in chapter 4. Th e s im p l e po in t is tha t access t o nance is lacking not only for the poor but for vast portions of the population in many low-income economies. If attempts to ensure that the poor do get credit result in distorting subsidies that damage the incentives for the micro nance industry, and the nancial sector more generally, to innovate in provid- ing access for the nonpoor, then their net effect on the poor could be counterproductive. Conclusions While still far from conclusive, the bulk of the evidence suggests nancial development and improved access to nance is likely not only to acceler- ate economic growth but also to reduce income inequality and poverty. The channels through which nance works to produce this impact are less clear, but the evidence from cross-country research, natural experi-ments, and general equilibrium models suggests that direct provision of credit to the poor may not be the most important channel. Hence fostering more ef cient capital allocation through competitive and open markets has always been and still remains an important policy goal. In most countries around the world, however, fewer than half the households have even basic nancial access; many nonpoor and small and medium enterprises are effectively excluded from the nancial system. For the most part, then, improving ef ciency without broadening access is likely to be insuf cient because it is likely to leave untapped the talents and innovative capacity of large segments of the population. Improving access for all of the excluded, not just the very poor, is therefore also likely to be an important policy goal for most developing countries. The direct provision of credit to the poor may not be the most important channel More than just the poor face nancial exclusion FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 138 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd AM139HOUSEHOLD ACCESS TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION Reaching out to low-income households and microentrepreneurs is quite challenging however, since issues of risk management, monitor-ing, and transaction costs tend to increase break-even interest rates and often lead to credit rationing. Here, innovative techniques and products developed by MFIs have helped overcome these information barriers. Nevertheless, micro nance services are costly to deliver, and they typi- cally require extensive subsidies. While a focus on improving access to the excluded does not need to involve subsidies, reaching out to the very poor does. Should such access be subsidized? Encouraging and taking advantage of technological advances, which are becoming more widespread and fast-paced due to globalization, may be more promising in broadening access for the poor than providing subsidies, as well as shifting the focus of policy to establishing an environment conducive to the adaptation of the new technologies and to the entry of providers that bring them in. These issues are discussed more fully in the next chapter, which concerns governments' role in broadening access. Notes 1. Introducing xed transaction costs into a general equilibrium model and thus endogenizing the size of the intermediated sector, Townsend and Ueda (2006) conclude that restrictive nancial sector policies in Thailand might have slowed the growth of nancial intermediation below the endogenous growth rate that would have resulted from increasing per capita income, as predicted by Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990). 2. General equilibrium models have limited power to mimic the real world, as shown by Jeong and Townsend (2003). They compare the t of the two models with exogenous and endogenous nancial intermediation, the two models later used by Gin\u00e9 and Townsend (2004) and Townsend and Ueda (2006), respectively, and nd that while both models t the data well, they both exaggerate the movement between low- and high-income groups and underestimate the movements within different income groups. While general equilibrium models t the long-term trends in the data reasonably well, Jeong and Townsend conclude that they cannot account for business cycle effects. 3. Reanalyzing the same data with a different econometric technique, Morduch (1998) failed to nd any signi cant impact of microcredit on bor- rowers' income, though he did nd an effect on consumption smoothing. 4. This technique was later named \"pipeline matching\" (Goldberg and Karlan 2005)Innovative techniques and products can improve n a n c i a l a c c e s s FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 139 FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 139 10/26/07 8:40:27 AM 10/26/07 8:40:27 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 1405. It is worth noting that such a design picks up the effect of credit for the marginal borrower. Assuming heterogeneity across agents, the effect might be lower or zero for those borrowers who easily got credit, since they may have plenty of close substitutes, while the effect could be even bigger for those who were denied credit by a bigger margin. 6. In particular, it is not only the sceptics who nd much of the less rigorous literature unconvincing. Coleman (1999) notes: \"Most existing impact studies are nonacademic project evaluations that are of a descriptive nature or suffer from the selection bias problem.\" In a useful survey of micro nance impact studies con ned to those that tried \"to select control groups whose observed characteristics were comparable except for their participation in micro nance,\" Little eld, Morduch, and Hashemi (2003, p. 2) conclude that while \"the general pattern of results sheds valid light on the question of impact, . . . few studies include fully rigorous controls for selection biases.\" Armend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch (2005, p. 199-200) write that the differences between anecdotes and statistical evidence \"should not be surprising: the anecdotes are culled to show the potential of micro nance, while the statistical analyses are designed to show typical impact across the board.\" 7. For evidence on the relation between durable-asset holding, education, and child labor, see Dehejia, and Gatti (2007). Several cross-country studies also assess the relationship between nancial development, education, and incidence of child labor; see Flug, Spilimbergo, and Wachtenheim (1998) and Beegle, Dehejia, and Gatti (2007). For evidence on access to credit and upward mobility, see Wydick (1999). For evidence on geographic proximity to bank branches and health, see Gertler, Levine, and Moretti (2003). 8. For a detailed discussion, see Ravallion (2004).9. Cross-country regressions using other poverty-related measures also point to a favorable impact. For example, Claessens and Feijen (2007) nd a signi cant impact of nancial sector development on the incidence of under- nourishment. One of the channels through which this relationship works seems to be nancial development enhancing the level and growth rate of agricultural productivity, which in turn leads to higher output and lower prices, which helps reduce the incidence of undernourishment. However, as is the case with many cross-country studies, identi cation issues remain. 10. The distribution data are notoriously dif cult to compare across coun- tries for several reasons, including the fact that they are based on different welfare measures (consumption versus income), different measures of income (gross versus net), and different units of observation (households versus indi-viduals), and adjustments for these differences are imperfect (Dollar and Kraay 2002; Deaton 2005). While these differences in measurement introduce an error into the regressions run by Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2007), this error should bias their estimations against nding a signi cant 8:40:28 AM141HOUSEHOLD TO FINANCE: POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RISK MITIGATION between nance and changes in income distribution. Further, the regressions of changes in headcount on nance are less subject to this concern as the headcount measures are based on a set of consistent household surveys (Chen and Ravallion 2004). 11. Using Thai data and testing a structural model with moral hazard and limited liability due to high enforcement costs, Paulson, Townsend, and Karaivanov (2006) con rm that moral hazard is the dominant source of nanc- ing constraints. In the case of poorer households, however, they cannot reject the hypothesis that limited liability also plays a role. Gin\u00e9 (2005) distinguishes between transaction costs incurred by borrowers and enforcement costs incurred by lenders and shows that enforcement costs limit outreach more than transac-tion costs do in the context of rural nance in Thailand. 12. To tease out the trade-off in group-based lending in comparison with individual lending, Gin\u00e9 and others (2006) created an experimental economics laboratory in a large, urban market in Lima, Peru, and conducted difference games with microentrepreneurs and potential micro nance clients. 13. Undertaking experimental games with a group of micro nance clients in Peru, Karlan (2005) nds that cultural similarity and geographic proximity predict trust and trustworthiness. 14. This could also refl ect that a disproportionate number of those MFIs that concentrate on the very poor are charitable concerns willing to channel subsidies to the poor rather than aiming at pro tability. 15. However, because of imperfections in the labor market, the poor women borrowers in the model of Emran, Morshed, and Stiglitz (2006) will not be interested in expanding their operation beyond a certain scale. 16. See Roth, McCord, and Liber (2007) for an overview of microinsurance products and delivery mechanisms. 17. Of cial data on remittance fl ows\u2014mostly from balance-of-payment statistics\u2014underestimate their true extent because a large proportion of remittances is sent through informal channels. In addition, in many cases, remittances sent through money transfer providers that do not settle through banks are not recorded in of cial data ei ther (de Luna Martinez 2005). A large share of remittances is thus misclassi ed as net errors and omission in balance-of-payment statistics. Using cost data on sending remittances through formal channels and assuming that use of these channels, but not the amount of remittances, is elastic to the cost of sending the remittances. Freund and Spatafora (2005) estimate that informal remittance fl ows equal 35-75 percent of formal remittance fl ows. 18. See Firpo (2005) for a discussion on the role of technology in reducing costs in micro nance. FFA_099-142_ch03.indd 141 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 14219. Recent research also shows that remittance fl ows can affect nancial development in the recipient countries, increasing access indirectly. For example, Aggarwal, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2006) nd that formal remittance fl ows, as captured by balance-of-payments statistics, have a positive impact on nancial intermediary development. 20. Microfinance institutions face another challenge as the industry matures\u2014competition. During the initial stages of micro nance, most institu- tions compete only against informal moneylenders; their monopoly position allows them to use dynamic incentives such as repeat and progressive lending, as borrowers do not have any alternatives. However, as MFI sectors mature, as in Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Uganda, MFIs start competing directly against each other in certain regions of the country, with negative implications for borrowers, who may become overindebted and receive less favorable loan terms, but also for lenders who encounter worse repayment performance. Effective information sharing among lenders is one way of overcoming these dif culties. For example, in the already-discussed Guatemalan case, Luoto, McIntosh, and Wydick (2007) calculated that the introduction of a credit information system allowed MFIs to improve their loan appraisal to the extent of lowering their break-even interest rate by more than 2.5 percentage points. 21. Rajan (2006b) argues \"let's not kill the micro nance movement with kindness. If we want it to become more than a fad . . . it has to follow the clear and unsentimental path of adding value and making money. On that path lies the possibility of a true and large-scale escape from poverty.\" 22.

It is not enough to say that the market will provide. Market failures related to information gaps, the need for coordination on collective action, and concentrations of power mean that govern-ments everywhere have an extensive role in supporting, regulating, and sometimes directly intervening in the provision of nancial services. Not all government action is equally effective, however, and some policies can be counterproductive. Complex system responses can make well-intentioned policies mis re, so successful policy design must be context speci c. Governance issues are important: policy success can depend on institutional quality. Measures that are effective in environ-ments that already enjoy strong institutions may fail elsewhere. At the same time, a well-functioning nancial system itself is likely to contribute to strengthening national governance.

It draws as much as possible on ndings from formal quantitative research to throw light on a few of the more dif cult choices that arise. Implementation of policy requires complementing the results of research analysis with practitioner experience, which this study does not attempt to summarize. Nontheless, the analysis presented in this chapter provides a base for sound policy advice. The treatment is necessarily selective but illustrates how other issues can be approached. Government action is necessary to correct market failures, but some policies can be ineffective or counterproductive FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 143 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 143 10/26/07 12:45:37 PM 10/26/07 12:45:37 ALL? AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 144Policies to improve nancial access and nancial development are not always the same It is important to set realistic goalsMany of the policies often recommended to enhance overall devel- opment of the nancial sector\u2014including the legal and information underpinnings needed to lower the cost of services for large enterprises, governmental entities, and wealthy individuals, and to improve the inno-vative capacity of the nancial sector\u2014will also help increase access to those now excluded from, or poorly served by, the nancial sector. That reduces the number of dif cult trade-offs that have to be made. But the overlap and alignment of the goals are not perfect. A policy reform pack-age for the nancial sector that does not explicitly prioritize access will tend to make different choices from one that does. For example, certain regulatory prudential measures aimed at nancial stability can restrict the degree to which banks can serve small borrowers. Concentrating institution-building efforts on developing an offshore nancial center to export ef cient wholesale nancial services could result in the neglect of the infrastructures needed to help onshore nancial intermediaries reach small, local producers. A reform approach to nancial sector policy that explicitly recognizes the importance of access can help ensure that nancial development also makes nancial systems more inclusive. In prioritizing access policy, it is important to recognize the limita- tions of even a very ef cient nancial system supported by a strong contractual and information infrastructure. Not all would-be borrowers are creditworthy, and there are numerous examples of overly relaxed credit policies that have reduced national welfare. Indeed, prudential regulation of banks in developing countries is largely concerned with ensuring that loss-making credit decisions are, on average, avoided. It is also important not to undermine market discipline by adopting rules or regulations (such as mispriced deposit insurance) that may distort the risk-taking or monitoring incentives of market participants. Access to other formal nancial services can approach universality as economies develop\u2014indeed the presumption that everyone should be entitled to some form of account at a nancial intermediary has gained ground in advanced economies and is essentially a reality in several European countries. The xed costs of service provision, however, have made it very dif cult for traditional nancial service providers to reach custom- ers whose need is only for tiny payment and savings transactions or who are located in small and remote markets. Over time, technological and organizational innovations should begin to overcome these barriers, and entry and other regulatory policies should be designed so that such innovation is not inadvertently blocked. More generally, the challenge FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 144 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 144 10/26/07 12:45:38 PM 10/26/07 12:45:38 PM145GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS This chapter starts with an examination of institutions and infrastructure\u2014for policy is to help build the necessary infrastructures and to ensure that the nancial system is one in which service providers are delivering as widely as is possible, given existing infrastructures, and are not hampered by inappropriate regulatory or other policies or by coordination failures (Beck and de la Torre 2007). This chapter begins by discussing some overall market development issues concerning general measures for improving the contractual, infor-mation, and other infrastructures needed to support an effective nancial system with good outreach. It highlights recent ndings that address the question of which institutional reforms should be prioritized. For example, in low-income countries, improving information infrastructures seems to yield more immediate access bene ts than undertaking legal reforms. But legal reforms are also important, and among those, there is evidence that other aspects of contract enforcement may be more important for access than protection of property rights against the state. It also notes that intermediaries can be helped to work around hard-to-remedy institutional de ciencies. The chapter then turns to speci c enabling policy actions to boost the capacity of market intermediaries to deliver nancial access. It r evi ews th e man y s u p po rti v e m eas ur es tha t n eed t o be ad dr essed. These range from speci c legislation to underpin payments tech-nologies that use the Internet and mobile phones, to ensuring that anti-money-laundering regulations do not choke household access, to securities markets regulation that is not so costly as to prevent listings by medium-size rms. The chapter then moves to a discussion of regulatory structure. Much of the needed regulatory structure for nance is designed to improve competition and ef ciency while restraining excesses, including impru- dent or exploitative behavior. The chapter focuses in particular on the potential for positive policy action to mandate access-enhancing product development, contrasting this with the usually counterproductive effect of unrealistic usury ceilings. It also describes recent evidence showing that market discipline can complement of cial prudential regulation but needs an appropriate policy environment to be effective. Next the chapter addresses the controversial question of whether gov- ernment should enter directly into the access business through ownership or subsidy of nancial service providers. Here it looks in some detail at state-sponsored credit guarantee schemes (showing how some of these appear to be as costly as many old-fashioned state-lending programs, \u2014and then turns to intermediaries\u2014 \u2014and the of ALL? AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 146with little clear bene t, while potential improvements in scheme design have often been ignored). Before concluding, the chapter turns to the links between politics and access. Financial sector reform delivering outreach is not politically unproblematic. Elites in closed-access societies may lose in the short run by policies that open access to nance and thereby to wider economic opportunities. Expanding Access: Importance of Long-Term Institution Building There is little disagreement that the ability of nancial service provid- ers to reach a broad clientele is highly dependent on macroeconomic environment and on the overall state of the contractual and information infrastructure. Theoretical and empirical research has con rmed that macroeconomic instability is an important obstacle to effective intertemporal contract-ing. 1 Fiscal imbalances in particular generate high and variable infl ation, often making the future value of money so uncertain (and dif cult to hedge) for both suppliers and demanders that long-term nancial contracts simply do not exist. Households will not give up control over their savings for longer time-periods in unstable macroeconomic envi-ronments, and nancial institutions will not commit beyond short-term contracts given funding uncertainties. Unsustainable macroeconomic and scal policies have often been the prelude to nancial instability and crises; the fear of macroeconomic and nancial instability also inhibits nancial innovation that can promote access. In addition, the scale of borrowing by free-spending governments tends to crowd out other bor-rowers, including (perhaps especially) small rms. There is thus clear scope for positive government action in the areas of macroeconomic stability and general institution building that supports greater nancial access. Policies not speci cally addressed to nancial sector needs but designed to improve the general business environment (communication, transportation, and energy infrastructure) in which nancial institutions operate, as well as the general security situation, are also of evident importance. The emphasis in recent literature on the importance of institutions\u2014 the \"rules of the game\"\u2014for economic development, and on the parallel \u2014and political economy Macroeconomic stability can foster nancial sector development\u2014 \u2014as can a positive business environment\u2014 \u2014supported well 12:45:39 PM 10/26/07 12:45:39 PM147GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS role these institutions are thought to play in nancial development, suggests that the mechanisms of nance are at the heart of the complex processes that lead to accelerated economic growth in a way that is still far from being fully understood (Beinhocker 2006). As such, adjusting institutions in directions that clearly help improve the functioning of nance is likely to be a highly effective pro-growth strategy. Even if the claims that nance plays the chief causal role in economic growth were to be proved false, and instead all of the causality came from the underlying institutional framework, emphasis on ensuring nancial performance is likely to select growth-effective institutions. Building these institutions is typically a long-term and diffuse endeavor, and it necessarily involves a key role for government. Government is the natural\u2014in many cases the only\u2014provider of some of the key organizations that support good institutions, such as ef cient, speedy, and fair courts. Government may also need to provide some or all of the needed registries of credit information, liens, and property ownership. Legislation that de nes the rights and responsibilities of companies, nancial entities, and other nancial market participants, avoiding uncertainty or ambiguity in contracts, is also a valuable part of the nancial infrastructure provided by government. First and foremost, then, governments can broaden access by making and encouraging infrastructure improvements needed for market development. 2 For the policy maker, or the adviser on policy matters, the range of institutional reforms demanded can seem overwhelming, as can the dif culty of implementing even a subset of them. What then are the priorities and how best can the obstacles to implementation be over-come? These are questions to which researchers are only beginning to nd solutions. This is not the place for a handbook of good practice in institution building. For one thing, much of what is held to be good practice in this regard still amounts to a transplant of models that have been successful in advanced economies and otherwise lacks systematic evidential founda-tions from across the world. 3 Yet, there are some interesting lessons from recent research ndings that speak to the priorities and likely successes in institutional reform. The rst wave of cross-country empirical literature on law and nance (La Porta and others 1997, 1998) established the strong role of institu-tions in boosting nancial market depth and economic growth, including nancial access. 4 To take one dimension of this, although most will agree Institution building requires a long-term commitment Evidence that legal institutions matter FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 147 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 147 10/26/07 12:45:40 PM 10/26/07 12:45:40 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 148that enforcement of investor and creditor rights is important for access, there has been less agreement on the nature of the legal systems that are best adapted to nancial development. As with nancial depth and other aggregate measures of nancial development, there appear to be fewer barriers to nancial access in countries with a common law legal tradition than in those whose legal origins spring from civil codes. 5 But perhaps it is not so much legal origin per se, but rather a degree of adaptability in legal institutions that is essential to ensure that contract enforcement can keep pace with changing nancial technologies. In analyzing the World Business Environment Survey data, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2005) also use measures of judicial independence and adaptability to look more closely at whether the style of law in effect has an impact on access as reported in these surveys. Their regressions suggest that rms in civil code countries face larger obstacles to accessing external nance than do rms in common law countries, especially in the dimensions of collateral requirements, long-term loans, and paperwork and bureau-cracy. Based on the performance of the other legal variables in the study, the authors suggest that these obstacles are more likely to result from the lack of adaptability in many civil code legal systems rather than from a lack of judicial independence from political pressures. 6 Arguably the most important institutions to put into place to achieve economic growth are those that reliably constrain the state from com-promising private property rights. North, Wallis, and Weingast (2006) argue persuasively\u2014in their ambitious, albeit not fully elaborated or proved, thesis\u2014that the most fundamental distinction between types of organized societies is that between open access societies and those that limit access to economic resources. The course of history suggests that the former have proved to be far and away the more successful, especially in recent times. According to the authors, social order in an open access society is maintained by competition, not rent creation, and competition requires a political system that does not depend on creating and capturing rents for a limited elite. This proposition nds some con rmation in econometric analysis of the cross-country data that is available on various aspects of national institutions relevant to nancial sector performance. In particular, Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) have looked carefully at the different types of institutional variables found in cross-country studies to infl uence nancial sector development and economic growth. They distinguish between those legal and political institutions that mainly underpin the The risk of expropriation can be a major threat to nancial sector development 148 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 148 10/26/07 12:45:40 PM 10/26/07 12:45:40 PM149GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS security of contracting between economic agents on the one hand and those that ensure the security of private property rights vis-\u00e0-vis the state on the other. Security of contracting includes measures of legal complexity and formalism in debt recovery; security of property rights includes measures of the constitutional constraints on the political executive and the degree of protection against risk of expropriation. All of these variables are strongly correlated with nancial development and economic growth (and with each other). To eliminate the likely feedback or reverse causality from growth to institutional performance, Acemoglu and Johnson employ as instru-ments not only legal origin, but also the mortality of colonial settlers, 7 with the interesting twist that legal origin proves to be a predictor only of the contracting institutions and settler mortality to be a predictor of the institutions related to private property rights. Indeed, they show that legal origin is also strongly correlated with enterprise survey responses on the quality of the courts and the functioning of the judicial system, but not with survey responses on of cial corruption and predictability of regulation, whereas exactly the opposite is true of settler mortality. Using these instruments, it is the private property rights institutions, rather than the contracting institutions, that prove to be most strongly associated with banking depth and GDP per capita. 8 If the econometric ndings of Acemoglu and Johnson are to be taken at face value, they have some clear implications: a \"grabbing state\" is a major threat to nancial sector development (and thus to economic growth); without institutions that restrain the state from preying on private property, the nancial route to economic prosperity is severely constrained. A conjectural synthesis of these results with those of Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7- Kunt, and Levine (2005) on judicial adaptability would say that protec-tion of private property against the state is key for the depth of nancial sector development, but that more speci c protections of contracts between private agents are important for determining access . 9 The nature of the 19th century European colonial engagement is of course not the only determinant of modern institutions in countries that were formerly colonized, but the long-lasting infl uence of that engage- ment has far-reaching implications for the needed institutional reforms along this dimension. Whether a country has been a settler colony (with the settlers ensuring that they would be relatively free of arbitrary exactions by the state) or an extractive colony (seen by the colonizing A potentially dif cult transition to open societies 12:45:41 PM 10/26/07 12:45:41 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 150country as merely a source of rent through primary production) seems to have had an enduring effect. As North, Wallis, and Weingast (2006) have stressed, only a few countries have successfully made the transition from a rent-creating, limited-access society to an open society where private property accumulation is relatively secure against expropriation by government. And researchers are a long way from understanding how, when, and why countries are transformed from closed to open access. Yet this transformation is what is called for. Pending success in reforming these most important\u2014but intrac- table\u2014institutions, it may be easier, and less politically contentious, to make progress on other dimensions. For example, within the category of legal institutions that support private contracting, Haselmann, Pistor, and Vig (2006) have distinguished between those that chiefl y enable the individual lender to recover on a debt (for example, institutions relating to collateral) and those that are mainly concerned with resolving confl icts between different claimants (for example, bankruptcy codes). Basing their analysis on evidence from the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe\u2014which adopted relevant legal reforms at different times after the collapse of the planned economy system\u2014these authors are able to show that bank lending is more sensitive to the institutions that govern individual claims than to those that resolve confl icts between multiple claimants. 10 Given the relative complexity of bankruptcy codes compared with laws and procedures related to collateral, this nding\u2014 which matches practitioner experience\u2014is good news for governments overwhelmed with institutional reform challenges. 11 While it is well accepted that, in addition to legal infrastructures, information infrastructures are also key for both nancial depth and access, it is not so clear which of the two classes of infrastructure matter most for developing countries. A recent contribution by Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) in this area has uncovered systematic differences in the relative importance of these two dimensions of nancial infrastructure to the growth of private credit. Based on a panel of aggregate data for 129 countries over 25 years, they con rm that creditor rights and the existence of credit registries, whether public or private, are both associated with a higher ratio of private credit depth to GDP, whether measured in levels or in terms of change. Interestingly, creditor rights (especially strong in countries that inherited the common law system) prove to be particularly important for private credit in the richer countries, whereas the information infrastructure (in What should the institutional priorities be? Information infrastructure appears to be especially important for poorer countries FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 150 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 150 10/26/07 12:45:41 PM 10/26/07 12:45:41 PM151GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS the form of credit registries) seems to matter more in the poorer countries. Given that it is arguably easier to build credit registries and other elements of the credit information infrastructure in low-income countries than to make lasting improvements in the enforcement of creditor rights, this is a nding of considerable importance and practical value. The private sector does, of course, have a number of ways of working around dysfunctional institutions. De la Torre and Schmukler (2004) discuss how U.S. dollar contracts (rather than local currency contracts), short maturities with rollover clauses, and contracting under foreign jurisdiction are mechanisms that cope with systemic risk arising from institutional de ciencies in developing countries. Using a remarkably detailed data set on the interest rate, collateral, and maturity of some 60,000 large bank loans in 21 countries, Qian and Strahan (2007) show how banks adapt to an environment of of cial corruption and defec- tive property rights by shortening maturities and increasing collateral (thereby facilitating timely action to intervene and recover on debts that begin to look doubtful). These ndings reinforce the point that even if protection of property rights is the key institution to get right, the col-lateral regime does act as a kind of substitute. If so, an improvement in the security of contracts can help the nancial system work around the other de ciencies. Qian and Strahan note two other interesting points. Where the procedural costs of enforcing collateral are high, local banks hold a higher share of lending to unrated rms (including SMEs); foreign banks, which have to rely more on collateral, stay away. In addition, only the interest rate on secured loans to rated rms varies with the cost of enforcement\u2014lenders have little intention of pursuing their claims on unrated rms through the courts. Differences in the ef ciency of legal systems can also affect the sectoral structure of lending. Haselmann and Wachtel (2006) show that banks in transition economies whose managers have more trust in the country's legal system also provide more SME and mortgage lending and less lend-ing to consumers, large en terprises, and governmen t. In Brazil banks provided payroll loans\u2014loans whose repayment is deducted directly from the borrower's payroll check\u2014at signi cantly lower rates than regular consumer loans, which were subject to the slow and inef cient recovery procedures of the Brazilian legal system (Costa and de Mello 2006). These ndings well illustrate the ability of nancial intermediaries to adapt and work around some of the constraints and environmental de ciencies that they face. 12 This may explain why some reforms have The private sector can adapt to weak institutions Some reforms may require others to affect access signi cantly ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 152disappointing results. For example, especially since the work of Hernando de Soto, it is commonly observed in the literature that, given the impor-tance of collateral, and the fact that secure land titles can often be the best collateral available to a borrower, effective land titling programs should be a good way of enhancing access to credit. Yet, when indi-vidual land titling experiments in speci c countries are examined\u2014as reviewed, for example, in a recent paper by Pande and Udry (2006)\u2014the estimated impact on credit has often been negligible and statistically insigni cant. Evidently, in these cases lenders had already substantially worked around the lack of land as collateral, or repossessing the land was not possible despite the title, or the cumulative effect of other obstacles to the functioning of the credit market remained severe. In any event, the single reform of titling has in these documented cases not had the impact anticipated in the literature. Sometimes a comprehensive set of policy reforms is needed. 13 One example of the kind of shortcut that governments can take to improve the functioning of the credit market is illustrated by the introduction in India in the 1990s of a new expedited mechanism for l o an co n tract e nf o r ce m e n t. As Visaria (2006) has sh o wn , this n ew procedure bypassed dysfunctional court procedures and resulted in a considerable increase in loan recoveries. Furthermore, interest rates on new loans contracted after the introduction of the new mechanism were 1-2 percentage points lower because of compositional changes in banks' portfolios. Visaria is able to establish this from an econometric study exploiting the facts that only loan contracts above 1 million rupees fall under this new procedure (thus generating cross- rm variation for the analysis) and that political resistance and a court injunction had pre-vented simultaneous introduction of the new institution across all Indian states (thus allowing cross-time and cross-state variation and the use of the difference-in-differences estimator discussed in box 2.1). 14 Speci c Policies to Facilitate Financial Access While indispensable for long-term sustainable broadening and deepening of nancial systems, broad institution building is a long-term process. The government can achieve additional impact in the short to medium term by taking action speci cally directed at facilitating nancial market activity that helps access. Beyond the overall legal structure and its pro-Policies to complement the long-term process of institution building FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 152 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 152 10/26/07 12:45:42 PM 10/26/07 12:45:42 PM153GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS tections, an important practical question is the extent to which contract enforcement in nance needs to be supplemented by speci c laws restrict- ing and clarifying, and thereby offering more reliable protection to, certain types of nancial contracts or nancial business more generally. The trend worldwide has been to expand greatly the degree to which the law is tightly de ned by statute rather than relying on judicial precedent in areas such as accountancy, banking, securities markets, unit trusts, leasing, payments, and so on. Indeed, the experience of practitioners in developing countries has been that many nancial contracts simply do not happen without the presence of an adequate explicit law to clarify that the contract will have the protection of the courts. But it is possible that law and regulation can become too intrusive, to the point where they are counterproductive for access; two such areas\u2014prudential regulation and anti-money-laundering\u2014are touched on later. Some of these measures for facilitating nancial market activity are generally unproblematic from a policy point of view, and their imple-mentation is constrained only by government capacity. These measures include putting in place the legislation, taxation, and other rules needed for speci c nancing tools and institutions such as leasing and factoring that are particularly suited to small and medium enterprises. So long as the tax arrangements are not unduly generous, these improvements will be uncontroversial. 15 Improved nancial literacy might also help if it can be provided at a low cost. The capacity of individuals and entrepreneurs to take advantage of available nancial services (and to avoid pitfalls) depends to some degree on adequate nancial education. Other policies can be more controversial, either because they involve trade-offs between the goal of achieving enhanced access and other accepted goals of public policy, or because the improvement in access is ambiguous. As discussed in previous chapters, credit registries\u2014through which lenders share information about their clients' repayment records\u2014are an established way of enhancing the ability of borrowers to signal a good credit record. Such registries have emerged in the private sector in numerous countries, but the public sector has also taken a leading or complementary role in many others (Miller 2003). Even where the operation and ownership of registries is left to the private sector, govern-ment action strongly infl uences the ability of registries to function. For example, given that privacy laws may severely constrain information sharing, th e d es ign o f cr edi t r egistri es is highl y r el evan t. S haring o f credit information strengthens the competitive environment in the credit Credit registries can increase access by establishing a good credit record for some\u2014 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 153 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 154market. Incumbent banks, however, might not be interested in sharing positive information, as that increases competitive pressure from possible entrants. So the government may have to consider making information sharing mandatory, either through legislation or by regulation of licensed intermediaries. At a more prosaic level, measures such as giving every individual a national identi cation number can dramatically improve the ease and effectiveness of the operation of the credit information industry with regard to individual or micro nance borrowers. Some have argued that credit registries have drawbacks. While better credit information gives lenders the con dence to expand their customer base, it also enables them to identify and screen out some high-risk bor-rowers who might have received credit in a low-information environment. If so the improvement in access may not be uniform and may result in some groups being left even further behind. Evidence for this kind of effect comes from the so-called \"home credit\" market in the United Kingdom, where more re ned information and credit scoring systems have resulted in the main mortgage lenders withdrawing from some geographical segments. 16 On balance, though, the indications are that the number of losers is small compared with the number of winners, and besides the losers are likely to be the least creditworthy and most prone to overindebtedness (U.K. Competition Commission 2006). Some observers have also questioned the degree to which compulsory sharing of credit information undermines the pro tability of relationship lending, thereby discouraging lenders from investing in such relation-ships and possibly reducing access in some market conditions (Semenova 2006). Errors and abuses in the maintenance of credit records can be damaging for individuals; regulations need to guard against such errors and to ensure that the collection and sharing of credit information does not in practice represent an unwarranted invasion of borrowers' privacy. Even the establishment of national identity numbers has been contro-versial from a civil liberties perspective in some countries. Reducing costs and increasing the certainty of registering and repos- sessing collateral in the event of a default is also crucial. In Brazil, for example, legal and enforcement obstacles facing lenders trying to repos-sess property have kept mortgage rates too high to be affordable for the poor (Kumar 2005). Residential mortgage lending remains small in scale and accessible mainly to upper-income groups, although there are a growing number of experiments in microlending for housing. Some speci c legislation and other policy measures are typically called for to \u2014but also exclude high-risk borrowers Dif culties in repossessing collateral may lead to higher interest rates and reduced access FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 154 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 154 10/26/07 12:45:43 PM 10/26/07 12:45:43 PM155GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS support developments here. For example, practitioners discuss the ques- tion of special policies to promote a market in mortgage securities that would help expand the supply and lengthen the maturity of housing loans (Chiquier, Hassler, and Lea 2004). Of course policy efforts to improve housing for a wider group go well beyond issues of housing nance. 17 The rapidly evolving technologies based on the Internet (e- nance) and cell phones (mobile phones, or m- nance) can be powerful engines of access (Porteous 2006).18 But a lack of legal clarity may impede the adaptation of these technologies. Government needs to keep legislation up to date not only to ensure contracting parties that what they intend will be unambiguously enforceable but also to prevent legislation from blocking new innovations. Even though most of the technical problems seem to have been readily soluble, and despite the huge potential mar-ket\u2014probably more individuals have mobile phones than are connected to the electricity power grid in many low-income countries\u2014m- nance has been slow to take off. A major early success was in the Philippines, where two companies signed up a total of 4 million customers. South Africa was also an early adopter of m- nance, and it has been followed in Africa by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Zambia, illustrating the potential for this technology (with its low marginal costs) to overcome the problem of high unit costs that shut out low-income customers in countries with relatively weak infrastructures. But when it comes to policy design as it relates to m- nance, some unresolved problems have emerged. De ning and updating the legisla- tion that gives participants in the market (especially providers) full legal protection for the diverse electronic transactions that are involved is a costly and dif cult undertaking for low-income countries. From this point of view, providers have had to take a leap of faith to enter this market. There is also the question of regulatory barriers to entry. From a technical and nancial point of view, telephone companies can provide small-scale payments services without having to draw on the services of a licensed bank. But regulation may insist that such services are provided only by a bank (as is the case in South Africa), and if so the compliance costs can be a major barrier to entry (Porteous 2006). 19 A contrasting example is Kenya, where the regulatory regime has been more open to initiatives of the phone companies, and innovation is beginning to be rewarded by relatively rapid consumer take-up. Any payments system can entail risks of money laundering and ter- rorism nancing, potentially justifying the imposition of AML-CFT Legislation must adapt to new technologies\u2014 \u2014including ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 156(anti-money-laundering and combating of nancial terrorism) regula- tions. This too can become a barrier to the establishment of m- nance facilities, even though a risk-based approach would show that almost all of the m- nance customers pose negligible risks of this type. 20 Even more controversial is the design of regulation for securities mar- kets. While general principles have been agreed under the auspices of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, these can be implemented with varying degrees of formality. More formality means higher xed costs of establishing and maintaining a stock market listing, and the result can be a crowding out of smaller issuers. Low-formality models, such as London's innovative Alternative Investment Market, rely heavily on the reputation of intermediaries known as \"nominated advisers\" to ensure that the issuer complies with the relevant principles. Because of its lower cost, this model has attracted a large number of issuers. This system has been criticized for not doing enough to protect investors. There is little systematic empirical evidence on this topic; however, some practitioners argue that by lowering entry costs, this kind of approach could yield substantial bene ts of greater access for medium-sized issuers, especially in low-income countries (Grose and Friedman 2006). 21 Policies to Promote Competition and Stability The literature on the functioning of policies for nancial intermediary competition, prudential regulation and supervision, and protection of the poor against abusive lending is vast; here we can only mention a small selection of relevant research ndings. The reader also should bear in mind that the applicability to developing countries of lessons learned in advanced economies is not always clear. For instance, numerous deposit insurance schemes have been transplanted from advanced economy mod-els and proved poorly adapted to the circumstances of their developing country hosts, resulting in excessive risk taking by banks and subse-quent widespread fragility and crisis (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Kane 2002). Regulatory institutions that have evolved in advanced country settings should not be unthinkingly transplanted to the very different political and institutional settings that prevail in most developing countries. 22 The role of competition in enhancing access has already been discussed in chapter 2. Policy makers who seek to stimulate greater competition often have only a limited range of effective tools they can Balancing access against formality of investor protection in the regulation of securities markets A limited range of effective tools for competition policy\u2014 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 156 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 156 10/26/07 12:45:45 PM 10/26/07 12:45:45 ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS use, especially in small, low-income markets. A liberal entry policy vis- \u00e0-vis reputable nancial service providers can help, but it may not be enough. Transparency of product pricing and the compulsory sharing of credit information can also help, as can rules about network access and interoperability of networks in the retail payments system, but these may not be fully effective either. Because of their traditionally high unit costs, the main banks in most countries have been slow to provide products adapted to the needs of low-income households, even though they could be in a better position to do so than others because of the advantages of incumbency . More and more advanced economies have been adopting af rmative regula- tory policies that require nancial intermediaries to make appropriate products available to disadvantaged groups. 23 The features needed in such products can be deduced from the reasons given in surveys of those who do not use banking services, including the cost of banking and the risk of a costly loss of control of their nances. Among the products that could help are basic bank accounts that allow low-cost, simple transactions of modest size and that have mechanisms to protect low-income users from inadvertently triggering unauthorized overdrafts. 24 Where low-income customers represent only a fraction of a pro table banking market, the authorities can insist on such facilities being introduced without fear that the banks will exit. This might not be the case in many develop-ing countries. But recently in South Africa, nancial service providers introduced voluntarily (albeit under an implicit threat of legislation) a nancial sector charter that included a basic bank account scheme. More generally, as discussed in chapter 2, policies to promote competi- tion in the banking system can also help restrain the exercise of market power that could be damaging to access. With their traditional lines of business coming under competitive pressures, incumbent institutions have an incentive to reach the underserved segments and increase the speed with which access-improving technologies are adopted. 25 The same competition that can help foster access to nancial services can also result in imprudent lending binges if it is not accompanied by a proper regulatory and supervisory framework. The nancial market rules with the highest pro le are the increasingly complex battery of prudential regulations imposed on banks to help minimize the risk of disruptive and costly bank failures. The contraction of credit often associated with systemic banking crises hits the poor as well as the rich\u2014sometimes more so\u2014and the poor are less able to bear losses (Honohan 2005a; Halac \u2014such as af rmative regulatory policies Prudential regulation and supervision can reduce the risks of banking crises\u2014 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 157 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 158and Schmukler 2004). The goal of nancial stability is thus generally aligned with that of access, although some stability-oriented measures have the potential to restrict access (box 4.1). 26 Indeed, an important current debate among scholars centers on what style of prudential regulation works best, both in ensuring stability and avoiding potential side effects such as hindering nancial sector develop- ment and facilitating corruption. Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2006) have addressed this issue with regard to banking. They collected detailed information about the powers and conduct of bank supervisors in over 150 countries in 1997 and in 2001, searching for causal links between regulatory style and the performance of banking systems across the world. Based on regression analysis linking measures of national regulatory style to nancial access and other eco- nomic outcomes at the individual rm level, the authors concluded that FOLLOWING AGREEMENT AMONG THE REGULATORS of the largest industrial countries on a revised frame- work establishing minimum capital requirements for international trading banks and new supervisory practices, bank regulators all over the world have been taking steps to make comparable revisions in their bank regulation. The new framework, known as Basel II, is intended to avoid regulatory arbitrage by sophisticated banks by making required capital more sensitive to measurable differences in credit and other risks faced by banks. Although it is recognized as embodying technical compromises and could in certain circumstances amplify risk, Basel II's more elaborate approach to capital requirements has trig-gered technological advances in risk measurement by banks. There is much to be said for the drive to a more scienti c approach to risk management, which has been encouraged by the Basel II process and which has the potential to improve access for creditworthy borrowers. But Basel II also has the potential to limit rm access to nance in developing countries. For one thing, the risk weight attached to international bank lending to some developing countries is likely to increase, especially at times of economic dif culty, and this could contribute to an onshore credit crunch affecting rm borrowers (Ferri, Liu, and Majnoni 2001). Concerns have also been raised that foreign- owned banks, reluctant to incur the costs of multiple regulatory reporting, might pressure regulatory authorities to adopt the new system even in developing countries where the advanced risk measurement techniques of Basel II are impracti-cal or premature (Honohan 2001). If that occurs and results in higher compliance costs for local banks and inappropriate risk rating of borrowers, access could be damaged. In addition, by failing to make full allowance for the potential for a portfolio of SME loans to achieve risk pooling, the Basel II rules miss an opportunity for banks to use improved information on the distribution of risks to make SME loans at more competitive rates (Adasme, Majnoni, and Uribe 2006). Box 4.1 Basel II and access \u2014but too much discretionary powers for bank regulators can be harmful FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 158 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 158 10/26/07 12:45:46 PM 10/26/07 12:45:46 PM159GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS relying too much on discretionary powers given to government of cials to keep the banking system safe, sound, and ef cient may be misguided. Using the same data, Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2006, gure 4.1) found that rms in countries that grant the largest discretionary powers to their bank supervisors tend to complain more that the corruption of bank of cials is an obstacle to their rm's growth. 27 Barth, Caprio, and Levine argue that for banks to promote social welfare, a country needs political and other institutions that induce its of cials to develop policies that maximize social welfare, not the private welfare of of cials or bankers. From this analysis, it seems that empowering and inducing large private market participants to conduct their own due diligence or monitoring of banks (for example, ensuring good disclosure of information) can be a powerful and often-neglected way of strengthening the stability of banking while at the same time improving the reach of the system. And this is not just a message for Figure 4.1 Supervisory approaches and corruption in lending Source: Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine (2006).

POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 160advanced economies. On the contrary, the potential for market discipline to be relatively effective even in low-income countries is often under-estimated (Caprio and Honohan 2004). Similarly, ensuring that bank supervisors are independent of the political sphere and of the supervised entities themselves, while at the same time accountable to the general public is important, though often dif cult to achieve given political and institutional traditions. In many countries, especially those whose law is based on civil code, supervisors are still liable for their actions, even if undertaken in good faith, making them subject to frivolous law suits. Similarly, many countries seem reluctant to give the same degree of politi-cal independence cum accountability to bank regulatory entities as they have given to central banks (Quintyn, Ramirez, and Taylor 2007). Prudential policies, however, are important not only at the bank or system level but also at the borrower level. As discussed in chapter 3, when it comes to borrowing by the poor, more is not always better. Very poor people, especially those hit by adverse shocks, such as ill health or natural disaster, and those with chaotic lifestyles, can easily nd themselves in an overborrowed situation where their inability to service accumulated debt has severe effects on their wellbeing. Most often this occurs by accident, but in some cases it can be attributable to predatory behavior by lenders deliberately exploiting the gullibility and ignorance of the borrowers to trap them in spiraling charges. The approach of caveat emptor, which assumes that borrowers have a clear picture of the costs and bene ts of entering a borrowing rela- tionship and the capacity to make rational choices, is certainly not true for marginal groups\u2014and the margin can be quite large in developing countries. 28 These borrowers need to be protected against abusive, deceptive, extortionate, or predatory behavior, but doing so is not easy. Although protecting the vulnerable from unwise borrowing and dealing with the overborrowed poor has long been considered an appropriate matter for public policy, as yet no generally agreed policy approach has emerged, even in the advanced economies. Policy measures to deal well with these kinds of situation may be beyond the technical capacity of many developing country governments. 29 One traditional approach, a ceiling on interest rates (usury laws), is still widely used, although it is increasingly considered rather ineffec-tive as a measure, not least because opaque cost structures can result in total costs of credit greatly exceeding stated interest rates. Using what is known as \"behavioral pricing,\" unscrupulous lenders advertise low Policies restraining abusive lending to the poor Interest rate ceilings are rarely effective\u2014 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 160 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 160 10/26/07 12:45:47 PM 10/26/07 12:45:47 PM161GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS interest rates knowing that they will attract na\u00efve and disorganized bor- rowers who do not realize that their predictable behavior is sure to result in a very high overall cost of credit when penalties for late payments and other charges are factored in. At the same time, to the extent that regulators can detect and limit these extra charges, low ceilings on inter-est rates are clearly counterproductive if they exclude many low-income households that could be creditworthy even at the high rates needed by lenders to cover the costs of processing the borrowings. As a result, although most advanced countries still have usury ceilings, these have been relaxed or quali ed by exemptions (Policis 2004; Helms and Reille 2004; Goodwin-Groen 2007). Constraints on interest ceilings do exist in numerous developing countries, and it is widely accepted that they inhibit the expansion of credit by formal and semiformal intermediaries. For some Muslims, prohibition of riba entails avoidance of all interest- based nance, although there are practical alternatives (box 4.2). Allowing a category of licensed or supervised lenders to exceed the basic usury level is one device that many advanced jurisdictions have used to bring high-interest lending into the light of day, rather than consigning it to the shadows in illegality. 30 This licensing needs to be accompanied by enforceable consumer protection rules to ensure that charges are RELIGIOUS SCRUPLES CAN RESULT IN SOME self-exclusion. To meet the nancing and invest- ment needs of Muslims whose beliefs and ethical frameworks may preclude them from using some conventional nancial instruments, a large indus- try of sharia -compliant nancial instruments has emerged in recent years and is being constantly refined. These instruments are scrutinized and authorized by legal scholars for their compliance with Islamic precepts. Financial instruments are pro-hibited if they allow forbidden forms of exploitation by charging riskless interest ( riba); entail radically uncertain nancial transactions ( sum games of pure chance ( maysir ), especially those that involve actual or potential deception; or nance forbidden ( haram ) activities. Experts have found ways of meeting the core nancing requirements of modern economies (including insurance through takaful ) without violating these precepts. Indeed, innovation in sharia -compliant nancial engineering continues with the goal\u2014shared with conventional nance\u2014of providing for the needs of enterprise while pooling risk and assigning risk to where it can best be borne (Jaumdally 1999; Obaidullah 2005). For example, the global demand for sukuk , a type of Islamic bond that Malaysia helped popularize, has been growing very rapidly. In addition, many Muslims advance charitable funds ( qard al-hasan ) at a zero rate of return to help meet the nancing needs of poor people.Box 4.2 Sharia -compliant instruments for ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 162transparent and that lenders do not make loans to those who cannot bear the service charges.31 This approach is also used in South Africa, and it could be applied more widely in developing countries, though its effec-tiveness depends on the capacity of the licensing authority to enforce the accompanying rules of good lender practice. But even advanced countries have had dif culty enforcing the transparency requirements, and in an environment of widespread illiteracy, establishing what information has been provided to the borrower is not obvious. As a result, this approach is not practicable in many low-income countries. A r ece n t co m pariso n o f co ns um e r cr edi t in th e thr ee largest E U economies displays the wide variation in regulatory philosophy and suggests the very considerable consequences that this variation may have for the scale and nature of the consumer credit market for middle- and low-income people. Although thorough econometric analysis is still lack-ing, the tighter interest ceilings (and other rules for lenders) in France and Germany may have had quite signi cant effects on restricting the range and availability of legally provided credit, compared with credit in the United Kingdom, and seem to have been associated with a higher incidence of overborrowing (Policis 2006). The fraction of borrowers who have defaulted on high-cost, subprime credit cards is much higher in U.S. states with binding usury laws than in states without such laws, pointing to the lack of other more suitable sources of credit for low-income borrowers (Policis 2004). Even in the United Kingdom, which no longer has usury laws, a small minority of individuals in dif cult circumstances has no access to legally provided credit. But when these individuals have recourse to illegal lenders, they pay on average about three times the prevailing cost of legal credit and are typically subjected to aggressive debt collection and predatory lending abuses. Usury laws in France and Germany are likely at the root of the nding that more of the destitute in those countries borrow in the illegal market than do the poor in the United Kingdom; if so, the usury ceilings effectively remove protection from them rather than giving it (Policis 2006). Overborrowing can result from misfortune as much as from abusive behavior of lenders. In that case, the primary need may be for assistance to the overborrower in nding a viable workout plan with the creditors. Some countries have formalized personal bankruptcy or administration schemes. The likely impact on credit market functioning should be borne in mind in designing public policy regarding overborrowing, respecting \u2014and may even be counterproductive Bankruptcy laws should take moral hazard into account FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 162 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 162 10/26/07 12:45:49 PM 10/26/07 12:45:49 PM163GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS the danger of moral hazard behavior, the limited capacity of courts or bankruptcy tribunals, and the impracticality of having costly procedures to deal with debts of poor people that are small in absolute terms. Public policy around the supply of credit for low-income households thus needs to ensure contract and pricing transparency, lender respon-sibility, and measures to facilitate workouts for the overborrowed. Many administrative resources must be used to implement and enforce these policies, and those costs must be factored into the policy design. Government Interventions in the Market If access to nancial services is a powerful tool for reducing poverty, as many economists and policy makers argue, an a priori case might be made for subsidization. Subsidization of these xed costs, however, would have to be justi ed in relation to competing demands for public funds. As chapter 3 discussed, the case for subsidization of nancial services in this context is hotly contested in discussions of micro nance. The deadweight cost of diverting subsidies to intramarginal clients, especially when the target group cannot be well de ned, and the risk of undercutting market innovation that could enhance access on a sustainable basis are but two of the problems cited. The scal costs of de facto credit subsidies can be high\u2014often much higher than predicted ex ante (see, for example, Adams, Graham, and von Pischke 1984; and Micco, Panizza, and Ya\u00f1ez 2007 32). The effectiveness of numerous of cial attempts to improve the reach of SME lending and the maturity structure of SME loans is doubtful (Caprio and Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt 1997; Beck and Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt 2006). Political subversion of directed credit programs has been a signi cant problem. Sometimes such schemes have ended up channeling sizable loans to political cronies, but politicization of small-scale lending has also been observed. It is easy to see why: extending small loans is an ideal political lever, with evident bene ts and opaque costs. That is especially evident when the lenders are state-owned banks, as discussed below. Even where politicization is not a problem, attempts to redirect credit toward disadvantaged groups often seem to be ineffective. 33 Perhaps the most widely discussed policy intervention of this type was the restrictive branching law adopted in India in 1977; under this law banks wishing to open additional urban branches were rst obliged to open additional rural branches. The rural locations bene ted from Interventions through taxes and subsidies\u2014 \u2014can be 12:45:49 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 164additional banking services, although the process was not costless (box 4.3). This intriguing scheme can be considered an implicit self- nancing combination of tax and subsidy, but it would be hard to judge whether the tax fell more heavily on the banks or the urban dwellers. Ease of raising revenue from the sector has resulted in numerous other forms of tax or quasi-tax being imposed on the nancial sector in most countries; not least are large and underremunerated reserve requirements and\u2014a recent fashion\u2014 nancial transactions taxes. The distortions created by these taxes have sometimes been very severe, especially when infl ation is high. The potential negative impact on the outreach of the nancial system from the introduction of such taxes needs to be borne carefully in mind (Honohan 2003). Despite a few success stories, substituting government provision of nancial services for that of the market is generally considered problem- atic. The poor record of government development banks in delivering broad access or lowering poverty weakens the case for using this tool Between 1977 and 1990, the Reserve Bank of India mandated that a commercial bank could open a new branch in a location that already had bank branches only if it opened four in locations with no branches. This regulation was part of a social bank-ing program that tried to expand access to nancial services in rural areas. An ex post evaluation of this policy (Burgess and Pande 2005) shows that it had sizable effects. The 1:4 rule was a binding constraint on banks and together with a regulated branch-level loan-deposit ratio of 60 percent led to an increase in bank branches and in rural credit in less densely banked states, even after controlling for other state characteristics that might have driven branch and credit expansion. One interesting nding: whereas the presence of more bank branches in a state was associated with more rapid poverty reduction in that state in the period before and after the policy was in effect, this correlation was absent between 1977 and 1990. This n ding, whi ch is ro b ust t o other policies introduced over the period and to controlling for endogeneity, suggests that avail-ability of a bank branch is poverty reducing, even where the branch has been opened only as a result of the policy. The regression results imply that rural branch expansion during the policy period may have accounted for 60 percent of all rural poverty reduc-tion during the period, largely through an increase in nonagricultural activities, which experienced higher returns than in agriculture, and especially through an increase in unregistered or informal manufacturing activities. But there was a signi - cant downside: commercial banks incurred large losses attributable to subsidized in terest rates and high loan losses\u2014suggesting potential longer-term damage to the credit culture. Furthermore, many governments do not have the carrot of licensing branches in markets as dynamic as those of some of the largest Indian cities to compensate for the stick of compulsory rural branches. Box 4.3 Rural branching in IndiaInterventions through government-owned intermediaries have a poor 12:45:50 PM 10/26/07 12:45:50 PM165GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS on the credit side. Instead the evidence is that state-owned banks tend to lend to cronies, especially around the time of elections, as vividly displayed by recent detailed analysis of statistics on bank credit by Cole (2004), Din\u00e7 (2005), and Khwaja and Mian (2005), whose ndings con rm numerous anecdotes. For example, Cole has shown that government-owned banks in Indian states ramped up agricultural lending in tightly contested districts in election years. Given a history in which state governments cancelled banking debts in the past, borrowers might not only have been glad of the loan, but likely assumed that it might not have to be repaid if times became hard. 34 Din\u00e7 showed that increased lending by government- owned banks right before elections is not speci c to India but can be observed in data from 22 developing countries.35 Drilling down to the individual loan level, Khwaja and Mian found evidence from Pakistan that politically active borrowers were able to secure larger and cheaper loans from state-owned banks and defaulted on these loans much more than other business borrowers ( gure 4.2). 36 Even though not all state-owned banks performed poorly (Levy Yeyati, Micco, and Panizza 2006), this and a large body of other evidence make \u2014including the use of political criteria to grant loans Figure 4.2 Size of loans by Pakistani banks Source: Based on Khwaja and Mian (2005). Note: Larger, politically connected loans default more than nonpolitical loans and are more likely to be from government-owned banks. There was no signi cant correlation between political connections and size of loan from nongovernment banks.Index0 50 100 150 200 250Defaulted political loans from government banks Defaulted nonpolitical loans from government banks Performing political loans from government banks Performing nonpolitical loans from government banks Loans from nongovernment banks ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 166it easy to see why many countries have preferred to sell large state-owned banks, even to foreign-owned entities.37 In the case of depository services, experience has been more mixed. The postal banking service and state-supported savings banks have tra-ditionally been seen as the providers of depository services to low-income groups. The wide geographic network of post of ces and agencies makes it the tool of choice for offering basic payment and savings products in more remote areas. Japan Post Bank and the Russian Sberbank (formerly a savings bank) are among the largest retail nancial institutions in the world. Indeed, in France, the right to a banking account is essentially ensured through the postal savings system. Given the sunk cost nature of the post of ce infrastructure, banking services can be offered at marginal costs, a fact that implies signi cantly lower costs in the case of low-income clients with the need for small transactions (World Bank 2006b). At the same time, examples abound of postal banks with weak nancial structures because they lack a clear legal and accounting separa- tion from the post of ce. Preliminary cross-country evidence on access barriers suggests that, despite explicit mandates for government banks to expand outreach, in banking systems dominated by state banks, there are fewer bank branches and automated teller machines. Customers in such systems do face lower fees, but they also experience poorer service quality (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Martinez Peria, 2007a, b). Some state-owned banks, designated as development nance institu- tions (DFIs) or development banks, have a speci c public policy mandate to make long-term credit available to promote economic development in particular regions or sectors. While these banks have typically been urged to operate in as commercial a manner as is consistent with ful lling their mandate, the dif culty of doing that has led many to reconsider their business model. A handful of more sophisticated government-owned DFIs have moved away from credit and evolved into providers of more complex nancial services. Their know-how, willingness, and capacity to take initiatives that are consistent with their social remit\u2014even at the cost of a lengthy initial period of loss-making\u2014has allowed them to introduce into developing countries nancial products and markets that have been proven elsewhere but that entail heavy setup costs without certainty of high nancial return. Involving few if any credit risks, these services are less subject to political subversion. Moreover, employing public-private partnerships, the DFIs can help overcome coordination failures, rst- mover disincentives, and obstacles to risk sharing and distribution.The record is better for state-supported savings and payment services DFIs could become more effective as providers of know- how than of credit FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 166 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 166 10/26/07 12:45:51 PM 10/26/07 12:45:51 PM167GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS Three examples from Mexico illustrate. One is the electronic broker- age of reverse factoring, developed by Na n, a government development bank, which allows many small suppliers to use their receivables from large creditworthy buyers to obtain working capital nancing (Klapper 2006). Another example is the electronic platform implemented by BANSEFI, another government-owned institution, to help semiformal and informal nancial intermediaries reduce their operating costs by centralizing back-of ce operations. Finally, a government-owned DFI, turned investment bank, FIRA, has brokered quite complicated structured nancial products to realign credit risks with the pattern of information between nancial intermediaries and the different par-ticipants in the supply chains for several industries, including shrimp and other agri sh products (De la Torre, Gozzi, and Schmukler 2007). Given patient capital, the private sector could have undertaken each of these successful initiatives. Indeed, the Mexican government explicitly envisages privatization of at least some of these initiatives. But they have had a useful catalytic function in \"kick-starting\" certain nancial services in Mexico. Evaluation of interventions It is increasingly recognized that direct interventions to support access need careful evaluation. There are at least three potentially important dimensions to the needed evaluations. \u0081 First, a management audit is necessary to try to ensure that delivery is cost effective and that decision and control structures are optimized against best practice, with, for example, clear and effective procedures for measuring intended outputs and desired outcomes. 38 \u0081 Second, the impact of the scheme on the intended bene ciaries must be assessed. Comparing bene ciaries before and after the intervention is not suf cient, as a recent example of a govern- ment-sponsored scheme of poverty reduction loans in China shows (Chen, Mu, and Ravallion 2006). Once the research-ers controlled for the selection bias of the program targeted to poor households and for potential spillover effects to villages that were not in the program, they did not nd any long-term effect on incomes, except for the poor who were relatively well educated. FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 167 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 167 10/26/07 12:45:52 PM 10/26/07 12:45:52 PMFINANCE FOR ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 168 The best methodology is often randomized evaluation, as discussed in chapter 3.39 This methodology requires recording the experience both of program bene ciaries and of a control group; the latter must be selected with care to ensure that they were not excluded from the program as a result of the program's design. Unfortunately, most control groups are not selected until after the program has been started, complicating the subsequent evaluation. \u0081 Third, general equilibrium, or \"system,\" effects, especially of large- scale programs, must be taken into account. These are especially dif cult to assess, given that they affect nonparticipants as well as participants and may be subtle. Thus, for example, it is often argued that direct provision of services below cost can undermine the capacity or motivation of private service providers to incur setup costs for competing services. This is especially important in cases where there is no clear provision that the government intervention or subsidy will end after a certain time period. Not only can governance problems undermine the effectiveness of the program but they also can have negative spillover effects on the economy at large. This is where it is important to have a good conceptual understanding of the potential processes at work and the honest and skilled use of econometric techniques to deal with endogeneity, selection bias, and errors in variables. Overall, whereas better nutrition or education for the poor may be uncontroversial as overarching goals, the immediate goals of policy interventions to improve nancial access need careful de nition. Direct policy intervention has a chance of working only if attention is paid to getting four things right: \u0081 Clarity and logical coherence of the objectives of intervention \u0081 Governance structures that inhibit subversion of these objectives\u0081 Control over agency costs, especially credit risk related to adverse selection and moral hazard \u0081 Adequate technical and administrative arrangements. A canonical example of direct intervention: the credit guarantee scheme In the following pages we take a close look at one type of direct inter- vention\u2014government-backed credit guarantees. Most of the issues that FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 168 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 168 10/26/07 12:45:52 PM 10/26/07 12:45:52 PM169GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS arise in designing credit guarantee schemes have their counterparts in other types of direct intervention. The details described here for credit guarantees thus carry lessons for a wide range of policy initiatives. 40 With direct and directed lending programs somewhat in eclipse in recent years, the direct intervention mechanism of choice for SME credit activists in recent years has been the government-backed partial credit guarantee. According to Green (2003), well over 2,000 such schemes exist in almost 100 countries. 41 Thus more than half of all countries\u2014 and all but a handful of the developed countries\u2014have some form of credit guarantee scheme, usually targeted at some sector or category of rm that is thought to be underserved by the private nancial sector. Typically, these guarantee programs seek to expand availability of credit to SMEs and are sometimes focused on speci c sectors, regions, or own- ership groups, or on young or new technology rms (or even on rms that have been hit by an adverse shock and risk failure). Often there is a subsidiary employment, innovation, or productivity growth objective. But these trends refl ect more the disappointing experience of other forms of intervention than any substantial body of evidence that publicly funded credit guarantee schemes work well. Indeed, while new guarantee schemes are contemplated in several countries, some of the countries with the largest and longest-established guarantee schemes have been downsizing or drastically redesigning their programs. Of course, credit guarantees are observed in private nancial markets without explicit government support. They emerge typically for one of three main reasons: rst, because of differential information, as where the borrower's creditworthiness is better known by a well-capitalized guarantor than by the lender; second, as a means of spreading and diversifying risk; and third, as a regulatory arbitrage, as when an unregulated rm provides a guarantee allowing the lender to bring an otherwise insuf ciently secured loan into compliance with regulatory requirements or other government programs or nancial industry risk-rating practices and conventions. Government involvement in creating a credit guarantee company is often rationalized by the observation that SMEs commonly do not have the kinds of collateral that bankers require. Given that nancial markets are not perfectly ef cient, a decision by the government to step in where private nanciers have not found it pro table to do so need not necessar- ily involve subsidy and scal outlay\u2014although typically it does. 42 With many competing pressures for public funds, an economically coherent argument in favor of a subsidized credit guarantee system needs to go Weighing the welfare bene ts against the costs of subsidies 12:45:53 PM 10/26/07 12:45:53 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 170a lot further than the observation that such a scheme would increase the availability of credit. The government needs to be sure that such a scheme will increase overall welfare by enough to justify the subsidy cost, and not simply result in a costly distortion. A welfare economics perspective suggests three possible sources from which a net welfare improvement could come: \u0081 Market failure related to adverse selection . Lending may be rationed and undersupplied relative to the social optimum (see box 1.2); in such circumstances a credit subsidy might improve overall welfare. 43 \u0081 Correcting for unequally distributed endowments . Lack of col- lateral is most acute for low-wealth individuals and groups of people and for poorer geographical areas. However, it is far from clear that credit allocation is the best or even a good instrument to correct for unequal initial endowments. \u0081 Kick-starting SME lending . SME lending is not well developed in part because lenders have not accumulated the needed practical experience and the stock of credit information, and therefore face a lengthy loss-making startup period. Credit appraisal and management can build on experience, including systemwide credit history data and credit scoring. Reading between the lines of the diverse and often rather vaguely stated goals of publicly sponsored credit guarantee schemes, one can usually detect hints of one or more of these economists' arguments, perhaps most often the last one mentioned. 44 Whether these goals are fully achieved and at what cost is something that has never been evaluated in a fully satisfac-tory way even after the event, much less in advance. The evaluations that have been carried out focus on operational aspects such as ensuring that suf cient take-up or keeping the cost of the scheme within bounds. The cost issue sometimes attracts less attention in the early days of the scheme. After all, one obvious but super cial attraction for promoters of credit guarantee schemes is that the upfront cash commitment by the government is small in relation to the total volume of credit supported by such schemes. The liabilities are contingent and in the future, while operating costs can be covered by fees and premiums paid by bene - ciaries. The endowment of capital may be a small fraction\u2014often 5 percent\u2014of the allowed total sum guaranteed and need not be paid in cash. In due course, loan losses do emerge, and the adequacy of the It can be dif cult to evaluate the total costs of a scheme at its inception\u2014 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 170 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 170 10/26/07 12:45:54 PM 10/26/07 12:45:54 PM171GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS fees and premiums becomes evident only over time as the contingent liabilities inherent in this soft budget constraint crystallize. Estimating likely future underwriting losses is not as easy as it might seem, especially at start-up.45 If the target group has not been borrowing, there is little experience on which to project defaults and the consequent losses. Furthermore, default experience is highly dependent on the state of the business cycle, so that it is unwise to extrapolate from the experience of a few years. If there is a major economic downturn, then default rates and resulting losses can soar, as was seen in several East Asian countries in recent years. In practice the range of experience regarding cost has been enormous ( gure 4.3). 46 While numerous schemes have experienced much higher- than-expected losses, heavy and unanticipated underwriting costs are by no means a universal experience of credit guarantee schemes (Doran and Levitsky 1 997; Bennett, Doran, and Billington 2005). This nding is consistent with the belief of many bankers that loan losses can be held to acceptable levels through good credit appraisal and monitoring practices, but that it is the cost per loan of appraisal and monitoring that under- Figure 4.3 Estimated annual subsidy cost of selected credit guarantee schemes Source : Approximate gures based on data in Benavente, and Graham 2004. The U.S. gure assumes average maturity of 13 years (U.S. General Accounting Of ce 1996). The U.K. gure is the 2003-4 outlay divided by that year's fl ow of new guarantees (Graham 2004, para 1.12); using the average of the previous 10 years' new guarantees would give a much higher gure.Chile16 141210 86420 United StatesItalyPercentage of loan amount 12:45:54 ALL? AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 172mines the pro tability of SME lending. If so, a well-run credit guarantee scheme may not need to be very expensive, but it may also not be enough to attract bankers into the market for loans to the target group. If it is dif cult to estimate the likely future cost of a credit guaran- tee scheme, it is even more dif cult to evaluate the social bene t that results. Evidently the volume of loans guaranteed is a wholly inadequate measure of social bene t. On one hand, there might be no additionality involved\u2014the loans might have been forthcoming anyway even in the absence of the guarantee. On the other hand, additionality might be greater than the loan amount guaranteed, as receipt of the guarantee might leverage a much more substantial, unguaranteed nancing pack- age. Most evaluations of guarantee schemes rely on the qualitative assess-ment of bankers and SME insiders to determine whether availability of credit to SMEs has eased. Depending on the design of the scheme and in particular on the nature of eligibility rules, formal econometric methods can sometimes be used to throw light on this question, but only a few systematic attempts to do so have been made. 47 A speci c policy change in Pakistan allowed Zia (2007) to uncover credible evidence of very substantial deadweight (lack of additionality) in the subsidized export credit scheme in Pakistan. 48 By distinguishing between the experience of Chilean rms whose main bank began using the FOGAPE scheme at different times, Larra\u00edn and Quiroz (2006) estimated that micro- rms whose bank used the FOGAPE scheme had a 14 percent higher probability of getting a loan. At the same time, Benavente, Galetovic an d Sanh u eza (2006) n o t e evi d e n ce o f s izab l e dis p lace m e n t in th e scheme\u2014for example, a large and growing share of successive guarantees being granted to the same rms. Second, even if there is additionality, it might involve such heavy loan losses or transaction costs as to result in net welfare losses for the economy as a whole. And even if scal costs are low, the economic costs of misallocated resources can be high. In the Pakistan case, Zia calculated that diversion of unneeded credit to bene ciary rms could have held GDP below its potential by 0.75 percent. The operating expenses and underwriting experience of a credit guarantee scheme depend on the design of the scheme (as well as on the effectiveness of its administration). These will also clearly affect the success of the scheme in improving the availability of credit and achiev-ing any other goals of the scheme. The rst issue is pricing: systematic underpricing clearly adds to the scal cost of any such scheme. Three other design dimensions are worth noting. \u2014and even harder to calculate the bene ts Operational design is important PM 10/26/07 12:45:54 PM173GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS \u0081 First is the question of whether the guarantee scheme should carry out its own credit appraisal of each nal borrower who is being guaranteed. Some of the best-regarded schemes do not con-duct such retail assessments but instead rely on an assessment of the intermediary whose portfolio of loans is being guaranteed. 49 \u0081 Second is the rate of guarantee, that is, the proportion of the total loan that is guaranteed (along with related aspects, such as whether the losses are shared proportionately between lender and guarantor, or if the guarantor covers the rst or last portions). Many practitioners argue that the lender should retain a signi - cant part of the risk (at least 20 percent and preferably 30-40 percent, according to Levitzky 1997 and Green 2003), so that there will be an incentive to conduct credit appraisal. In practice, most schemes offer slightly higher rates of guarantee\u201470 to 80 percent being about the norm\u2014and up to 85 percent in the case of the U.S. Small Business Administration and 100 percent in some other cases (for example, Japan). Guarantee rates signi - cantly under 50 percent fail to attract lenders. Scaling guarantee rates according to the claims experience from each lender can improve lender incentives without the adverse distributional impact that would result from requiring nal borrower guaran- tees. Chile's FOGAPE has started to auction available guarantee amounts, with the lenders bidding on the rate of guarantee. 50 Bankers who bid for lower guarantee rates than the maximum allowable have their requests lled; others are rationed. In prac- tice, the auctions have resulted in the primary lender retaining between 20 and 30 percent of the risk (Benavente, Galetovic, and Sanhueza 2006; Bennett, Doran, and Billington 2005). \u0081 Third is the nature of the lending criteria, such as the catego- ries of eligible borrowers and the terms of the lending. Some schemes have relatively broad eligibility rules (for example, a ceiling on borrower size as measured by turnover, and a ceil-ing on the guarantee fund's overall exposure to the borrower). The more complex the criteria, the more likely opaque political interference with the granting of guarantees. At the same time, a broad set of criteria leaves the door open to deadweight in the allocation of subsidy to borrowers that have no need of it. Restrictions on the lending terms, such as interest ceilings, seek to limit the degree to which the lenders in an uncompetitive FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 173 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 174market capture rent from the scheme, but if these restrictions are set at unrealistic levels, they can open the door to corrupt side-payments. In practice the trend has been to move toward less complicated eligibility criteria over time. Although Japan and Korea have had very extensive credit guarantee schemes, with the stock of guarantees exceeding 7 percent of GDP in 2001, and still in excess of 5 percent of GDP at the time of writing, 51 guarantee schemes in most countries have typically covered only a small fraction of total SME lending, and guarantees amount to a fraction of 1 percent of GDP. Sometimes this is due to capacity constraints (as in the well-regarded Chilean scheme, which covers only about one-sixth of micro-, small-, and medium-enterprise lending). In other cases it is attributable to lack of demand, which in turn can be traced to such features as excessive procedural costs, lack of lender con dence, delays in claims payments, or narrow eligibility criteria. Systematic economic evaluations do not yet offer enough evidence to form an impression of which schemes, if any , truly represent value for money. But as this brief review suggests, the lessons of operational experience are that government-sponsored credit guarantee schemes have the most to show for their efforts where they have effectively and cred-ibly delivered an attractive package of services to lenders, with a view to enhancing their capacity to lend to the underserved sector, thereby p r o pelling th e m t o a s ustainab l y high e r l ev el o f l e n ding . Inn o va ti v e pricing can induce improved results (for example, better loan appraisal by lenders); even without subsidy, demand from lenders may be high where the scheme operator can add value, for example, by disseminat-ing industry information on SME loan performance. More and more guarantee schemes are likely to move to broad eligibility and other cri-teria, reduced subsidies, and more use of the portfolio and wholesaling approach in preference to case-by-case evaluation by the guarantor of retail loans. Government-sponsored credit guarantee schemes will never substitute for reform of the underlying institutional requirements of an effective credit system. The best of them can probably survive and add value even without ongoing government subsidies. Given the checkered record of such schemes in the advanced econo- mies, and this is true of many other types of direct government inter-vention in the nancial market, the question is not just one of avoiding Subsidies are not an ingredient for success FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 174 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 174 10/26/07 12:45:56 PM 10/26/07 12:45:56 IN FACILITATING ACCESS unthinking transplantation of success stories; it is more a matter of paus- ing to consider whether, if success is unlikely in a favorable governance and general institutional environment, an adaptation can work in the more dif cult environment of the developing world? THE NET FISCAL COST INCURRED B Y P UB LI CL Y funded credit guarantee schemes is just one example of a variety of access-related subsidies. As in other areas of development, the use of public funds is easy to justify in the interest of improving access and thereby promoting pro-poor growth. Such subsidies of course need to be evaluated against the many alternative uses of the donor or scarce public funds involved, not least of which are alternative subsidies to meet education, health, and other priority needs for the poor themselves. In practice, such a cost-bene t calculation is rarely made. Indeed, the scale of subsidy is often unmeasured. Furthermore, as with nancial sector taxation, subsidies in nance can be more liable to dead-weight costs than is the case for many other sectors (Honohan 2003). It is often especially hard to ensure that nance-related subsidies reach the target group or that they have the hoped-for effect. But an even more serious problem is the possible chilling effect of subsidies on the commercial provi-sion of competing and potentially better services to the poor. Subsidizing nance is likely to undermine the motivation and incentive for market-driven nancial rms to innovate and deliver. It is this danger\u2014that subsidies will inhibit the viability of sustainable nancial innovation\u2014that can be the decisive argument against some forms of subsidy. Note that it is not subsidization of the poor that should be questioned: the poor need help and sub-sidies in many dimensions. Subsidies to cover xed costs (for example, in payments systems, especially when these generate network externalities) may be less sub ject to this chilling effect than those that operate to subsidize marginal costs. But every case must be assessed on its own merits. Microfinance is the area of financial access where subsidies have been most debated. Many well-intentioned people have sought by means of subsidy to make credit affordable for the poor. As a result, a majority of micro nance institutions (MFIs) today\u2014though fewer of the largest ones\u2014oper-ate on a subsidized basis (Cull, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Morduch 2007). Some of these subsidies are for overhead, and the MFIs do not think of them as subsidizing the interest rates. Many currently subsidized MFIs aspire to reach a break-even point and ultimately become fully pro table. Others, including the famous Grameen Bank, consciously apply subsidies to keep interest rates down. MFIs that operate group-lending schemes and that in practice are more focused on the poor rely on the highest subsidies. While many borrowers are able and willing to service interest rates at levels that allow ef cient MFIs to be fully pro table, there is no doubt that demand and borrower surplus would be even higher if interest rates were lower. Many would agree with Morduch (1999) that the prospects of reaching many of the very poor with unsubsidized credit are low. Bu t ev en wi th a subsi dy , credi t will rarely be th e rst nancial service need of the very poor. Also, apart from ensuring that the subsidy does reach its target group, the question, as always, is whether introduction of subsidy undermines the emergence of a sustainable industry with extensive\u2014albeit incomplete\u2014outreach.

If North, Wallis, and Weingast (2006) are correct in their view that the decisive transition in economic history is that between limited and open-access societies, to understand this transition is, as they point out, to understand modern development. It is one thing to identify a policy measure that will achieve a net improvement in nancial access at reasonable cost and limited overall side-effects. It is quite another to suppose that such a policy will auto-matically be implemented by an enthusiastic government. 52 Governments are, after all, operating in a political environment, and the package of policies that is implemented often owes more to the balance of political infl uence than to the state of knowledge about policy effectiveness. 53 Why should governments introduce reforms that might be at the expense of incumbent elites? When the political and social structure of the state is predicated on limited access and the resulting rents, existing elites have limited enthusiasm for policies that would increase access to nancial services (Rajan and Zingales 2003). It may well be, as Rajan (2006a) argues, tha t in un eq ual soci eti es th e d es ir e o f each s u b gr o u p t o p r ese rv e i ts economic rents against all others tends to reinforce the status quo. The policy reform agenda is therefore not a simple matter of adjusting a fl awed policy stance or adapting existing laws to changing market and technological realities. Instead the reforms must be far-reaching if the gain in economic performance is to be large enough to be attractive to existing elites, who will have a smaller share of the larger postreform cake. Vested interests must be convinced of the merits of transition. Making that argument is a more effective way of inducing change than direct attacks on privileges. And prioritizing nancial access generates a detailed policy agenda for converting the aspiration for transition into concrete measures. For, despite the far-reaching nature of the institutional changes involved in the transition to an open-access society, it seems clear that reforms that really do improve nancial access should also help drive the societal transformation. The nancial access agenda thus points back to the nature of the institutional changes that are needed in society and as such provides a touchstone for reform. The reforms needed to improve nancial access as the decisive change mechanism in the economy are not only necessary but almost suf cient Existing elites may bene t from restricted PM 10/26/07 12:45:57 PM177GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS to de ne that wider policy agenda. This agenda ranges from matters of great generality down to questions of operational implementation and design. Delivering on this agenda calls on many different agencies of government and also typically needs support from external development partners. Engagement of civil society is essential to create the political environment within which governments will be induced to act. Numerous examples can be cited from research on policy adoption to illustrate the pressures that are involved. When and how do nancial sector reforms occur? What is the relative importance of private and public interest and ideology? In a classic paper, Kroszner and Strahan (1999) argued that the sequence in which U.S. states liberalized banking was consistent with the view that resistance to such policy changes was driven by the well-organized private special interest of the bankers and not by an objective or ideologically driven view of the public interest. 54 Eventually, technological progress and a competitive political system overcame the special interests of small bankers who bene ted from the constraints. In contrast, Haber (2005) argues that a less competitive political system in Mexico meant that the government limited entry into the banking sector in return for favors and for nancing for much longer than did the United States; as a result, by the early 20th century, Mexico was left with a much smaller, more concentrated, and more inef cient banking system. The example of branch deregulation in the United States also shows the potential for exogenous events, such as technological innovation, to overcome political resistance to competition-enhancing reforms. As the introduction of ATMs, money market checking accounts, and improvements in communication technology have reduced the banks' need to be physically close to their clients, the monopoly power of small local banks declined and with it political resistance to change. The prospect of accession to the European Union helped many govern-ments in transition economies to overcome political resistance against institutional reform (Beck and Laeven 2006). It is worth looking for such windows of opportunity when political resistance to reform may be weaker. Once started, there seems to be an internal dynamic to the process of nancial sector reforms, though timing can be also be infl uenced by macroeconomic conditions. Based on the timing of nancial liberaliza- tion in 35 countries over the period 1973-96, Abiad and Mody (2005) found that countries with highly repressed nancial sectors are unlikely \u2014but vested interests can be overcome in a competitive political system\u2014 \u2014and through technological innovation 10/26/07 12:45:58 AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 178to reform.55 Once reforms, even small ones, take place, however , the process builds momentum and further reforms become more likely. A balance-of-payments crisis typically triggers nancial sector reforms, but a banking crisis is often associated with an interruption or reversal of liberalization. Many other examples of political infl uence on nancial sector policy are reported in the literature. For example, seeking to explain the fre-quency with which underpriced privatizations are observed, Biais and Perotti (2002) discuss how a strategic privatization program allocating left-leaning voters enough underpriced shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the values of shareholdings. Perotti and Volpin (2004) argue, with some supporting evidence, that in countries with low political accountability, incumbent rms succeed in persuading politicians not to strengthen effective inves- tor protection in order to prevent potential entrants from raising capital. 56 Along similar lines, Feijen and Perotti (2005) suggest that, following nancial liberalization (which typically results in improved access to nance by new entrants), elites successfully lobby politicians to ensure weak contract enforcement with the result that their highly leveraged recent entrant competitors are unable to re nance in downturns, and have to exit the market. And lobbying can be effective even at the micro level. Claessens, Feijen, and Laeven (2007) discovered, using data on every political donation made by Brazilian rms in the runup to the 1998 elections, that political contributions are somehow rewarded by subsequent excess returns in the stock market. How to help align reform-making process with public interest? This is ano ther area where m uch mo re research is needed. Greater p ub lic awareness of the potential bene ts o f po li ci es t o b r oad en access will also be important to shift the political equilibrium in the direction of reforms that promote the public good. In this context, the challenges of nancial access and nancial inclusion clearly go well beyond ensuring nancial services for the poor. The middle classes too have insuf cient access to nance. Advertising the access agenda as a broad one that includes the middle class helps mobilize a powerful supporter in the struggle to broaden access (Rajan 2006b). The same mechanisms that expand access for middle-class households and SME entrepreneurs will often help expand the access for the very poor as well. This process will also help strengthen the links between formal and informal nancial systems and allow the poor to migrate upward.The middle classes can be powerful allies for the poor FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 178 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 178 10/26/07 12:45:58 PM 10/26/07 12:45:58 PM179GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS Conclusions This chapter has highlighted the complexity of the policy challenge in improving access. The discussion has been necessarily selective, setting out principles for effective government policy by drawing on and gen-eralizing lessons from speci c examples. Deep institutional reform that above all ensures security of prop- erty rights against expropriation by the state is an underlying, albeit often long-term, goal. Meanwhile legal and especially informational infrastructures can be strengthened to help nancial institutions work around a dif cult environment, thereby making the provision of wider access privately pro table. Ensuring competition is an essential part of broadening access as com- petition encourages incumbent institutions to seek out pro table ways of providing services to previously excluded segments of the population and increases the speed with which new, access-improving technologies are adopted. In this process, providing the private sector with the right incentives is key, hence the importance of good prudential regulations. A variety of regulatory measures is needed to support wider access. Taking consumer protection against abusive lending as an example, we have shown that interest ceilings fail to address the problem adequately and can even be counterproductive; increased transparency and formalization and enforcement of lender responsibility are a more coherent approach, along with support for the overborrowed. However, delivering all of this is administratively demanding. The scope for direct government interventions in improving access is more limited than often believed. Here, we have used credit guaran-tee schemes as an example of direct government intervention aimed at increasing access for SMEs. These programs can be more costly in bud-getary terms than anticipated, and their performance can be improved by careful scheme design. In the absence of thorough economic evalu-ations of most schemes, their net effect in cost-bene t terms remains unclear. If the interest of powerful incumbents is threatened by the potential emergence of new entrants nanced by a system that has improved access and outreach, lobbying by those incumbents can block the needed reforms. A comprehensive approach to nancial sector reform aiming at better access must take these political realities into account. Given that the challenges of nancial inclusion and bene ts from broader access go Institutional reform and building infrastructure are key long-term priorities Ensure competition and provide the private sector with the right incentives A limited role for direct government interventions The middle class may have the power to overcome the vested interests of the elites FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 179 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 179 10/26/07 12:45:59 PM 10/26/07 12:45:59 ALL? AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 180well beyond ensuring nancial services for the poor, de ning the access agenda more broadly to include the middle class will help mobilize greater political support for advancing the access agenda around the world. Notes 1. For a theoretical analysis, see Huybens and Smith (1998, 1999), among others, and for empirical analysis of the cross-country relationship between finance and inflation, see Boyd, Levine, and Smith (2001); Honohan (2003). 2. This infrastructure can also be seen as a public good that private provid- ers are not willing to provide. 3. Recently more country-speci c evidence has been accumulated through two programs conducted by the World Bank, in the latter case jointly with the International Monetary Fund. The Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes on insolvency and creditor rights, corporate governance, auditing and accounting standards, and other areas are detailed assessments of the contractual, information, and regulatory frameworks of countries and provide detailed reform suggestions. The Financial Sector Assessment Program provides a detailed assessment of the stability and development of countries' nancial systems as well as road maps to short-, medium- and long-term deepening and broadening. 4. LaPorta and others (1997, 1998) (and the literature that ensued) showed that, compared with French legal origin countries, the English common law countries have deeper banking systems and securities markets, more initial public offerings, more diffuse ownership of public equity, a higher ratio of market to book value of shares (Tobin's Q), and higher dividend payouts that are more closely tied to pro ts. The interpretation of these ndings remains quite controversial. LaPorta and others relate these outcomes to cross-legal system variation in the protection of minority shareholders and creditors and enforcement of law. Thus, to oversimplify, the common law system tends to offer stronger legal protection of shareholders and creditors, together with more ef cient courts and judicial systems. 5. While most scholars believe that ef cient protection of creditor and investor rights is an important determinant of nancial development, there has been considerable debate as to whether the legal origin variable proposed by La Porta and others (1997, 1998) is at the root of international differences in these rights, let alone their enforcement. This variable is correlated across countries with other predetermined variables such as geographical endowments, political structures, and ethnic diversity (Beck and Levine PM181GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS 6. However, related work shows that the distinction between legal systems according to adaptability is not completely aligned with the difference between civil and common law (Beck, Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Levine 2003). German civil code legal systems are found to be as adaptable as common law systems, suggesting reform possibilities to policy makers within the civil code legal tradition. 7. A proxy indicator for the quality of institutions that colonizers established during the 18th and 19th centuries, introduced by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001, 2002). 8. That is not to say that contracting institutions are of no importance. Far from it, as is shown, for example, in Cull and Xu's (2005) analysis of the contrasting experience on both of these dimensions in Chinese provinces. They nd that both property rights protection and contract enforcement matter for rms' reinvestment decisions. 9. This conjecture is not inconsistent with Acemoglu and Johnson's (2005) nding that it is the private contracting institutions that remain signi cant in explaining stock market capitalization. 10. Given their heavier reliance on secured lending, it is not surprising that foreign bank lending increases by even more. 11. This is not to say that reform of bankruptcy code cannot have an impor- tant impact, as Gine and Love (2006) show for the case of Colombia. Once it was reformed, the country's insolvency system managed to separate viable from nonviable enterprises, allowing the former to restructure and liquidating the latter. Further, systems with effective collateral systems and ineffective insolvency systems can result in severe imbalances in the long term. In practice, designing the needed reforms requires great attention to detail if they are to work effectively. For example, practitioners may have to scrutinize such aspects as the relative priority of secured and unsecured creditors in an insolvency, the availability of corporate workout solutions, the remuneration of insolvency professionals, personal liability for of cers and directors, discrimination between local and foreign creditors, stays on the premature dismemberment of a debtor's assets, and so on. 12. It is not only intermediaries that can perform the work-around. Fisman and Love (2003) found evidence that trade credit partly offsets national weaknesses in nancial sector de ciencies; industries with higher dependence on trade credit nancing (measured by the ratio of accounts payable to total assets) exhibit higher rates of growth in countries with relatively weak nancial institutions. 13. Field and Torero (2006) and Galiani and Schargrodsky (2005) nd similar results for land titling in the cases of Peru and Argentina, respectively. FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 181 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 181 10/26/07 12:46:00 PM 10/26/07 12:46:00 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 182In both cases the effect of land titling programs on access to nance was low or zero. In Peru, Field and Torero explain their nding with the political economy observation that freshly titled landowners feared less expropriation from lenders than before. 14. The Brazilian authorities have introduced several shortcuts to allow con- tracting parties to work around the painfully slow process of enforcing contracts through the court system, which can take several years. Apart from allowing payroll deduction of consumer loans, certain contract forms allow for expedited court procedures or even out-of-court enforcement (Kumar 2005). 15. Tax concessions to boost speci c nancial markets risk mis ring, because of the considerable potential for arbitrage. For a discussion and some overall principles, see Honohan (2003). 16. In this market, licensed lenders visit the borrowers in their homes on a weekly basis to collect the repayments, typically 3 percent of the initial amount borrowed over 55 weeks. (Ellison, Collard, and Forster 2006). 17. Pensions represent another area where details of legislative and regula- tory design can be crucial. Practitioners have been studying the performance of innovative regimes such as the one in Chile, and much research still needs to be done on ensuring that pensioners get value for money and a reasonable risk-return balance (both in the accumulation and the payout phases) and that pension funds contribute to the availability of long-term and risk nance to the private sector (Rocha and Impavido 2006; Rocha and Thorburn 2007). 18. Regulatory design should ensure suf cient certainty around electronic contracting, protecting customers adequately against fraud and abuse and aiming for interoperability between the technical platforms of different suppli-ers. In addition, Porteous (2006) proposes three principles of good regulatory design if m- nance is to transform the payments environment for low-income customers in developing countries. First, customer due diligence procedures for account opening should be risk based and should not unduly prejudice remote account openings by small customers. Second, customers should be able at least to make deposits and withdraw cash through agents and remote points outside of bank branches. Third, adequate provision must be made for the issuance of e-money by appropriately capitalized and supervised entities, which are not necessarily banks. 19. A regulatory decision in Brazil to allow limited banking services to be operated on an agency basis by lottery of ces and other bank correspondents raised similar issues, but in practice this initiative has worked effectively and has greatly improved access. By 2004 all municipalities in Brazil had some form of banking service, whereas only 29 percent had access to these services in 2000; half of the increase was exclusively attributable to correspondents (Kumar 2005). FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 182 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 182 10/26/07 12:46:01 PM 10/26/07 12:46:01 PM183GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS 20. More generally, the need to make AML-CFT regulations as access- friendly as possible is recognized by specialists in the eld (Hern\u00e1ndez-Coss and others 2005). To do so requires ensuring that these requirements are risk based and that they therefore do not impose documentation and veri cation requirements for low-income customers accessing services that have limited scope for abuse. Regulatory authorities need to engage with nancial service providers to design services needed by the poor, such as basic bank accounts, in such a way that they can be safely offered without triggering AML-CFT concerns. 21. Early evidence with these separate boards suggests a higher entry and exit rate of listed companies (potentially refl ecting the dynamism of the SME sector), but also lower liquidity, as most of the trading is done by institutional investors (Yoo 2007). 22. This is the case not least where regulation is in fl ux in the advanced economies, as with recent rules on corporate nancial information. Low-income countries in particular should not be made guinea pigs for novel and untested regulatory ideas that could impose costs. Assessments being carried out by the World Bank\u2014often in the context of the already mentioned joint World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program, and the wider Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes\u2014of the compliance of individual nancial systems with international nancial regulations have sought to bear this potential problem in mind. 23. In the United States, there are no such requirements, but the U.S. Treasury has negotiated with a wide range of deposit-taking institutions for the establishment of limited service, low-cost accounts known as electronic transfer accounts (ETAs), into which federal payments such as Social Security can be electronically deposited, even for bene ciaries with poor credit histories (Caskey, Ruiz Duran, and Solo 2006; Claessens 2006). So far, however, only a tiny fraction of the unbanked bene ciaries of federal payments have opened such accounts. 24. For example, arranging for money entering the account to trigger auto- mated, direct debit, bill-payment instructions so that payments cannot be made without money to cover them, a feature still lacking in the basic bank accounts recently introduced in several countries (Collard and Kempson 2005). 25. Competition policy for payments systems is an especially complex issue: new technology for retail payments requires novel theoretical analysis of the resulting two-sided markets involving both merchants and consumers (for an accessible survey, see Evans and Schmalensee 2005). There can be a tension between the desirability of achieving scale and network economies (through cooperation) and keen pricing (through competition). Specialists are still debat-ing optimal competition policy for advanced economies, with practitioners only beginning to look at the issues for developing countries (Guadamillas 2007). FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 183 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 18426. While protection of small depositors is important, the design of the nancial safety net should minimize moral hazard, thereby reducing risk-shift- ing behavior from bankers to society at large. 27. Once again these are the responses to the WBES survey. Numerous rm- and country-level controls were included in the regressions, which used a sample of about 2,500 rms in 37 countries, and the likely correlation of errors across rms within countries was carefully taken into account using a cluster- ing technique. The authors also control for each rm's response to nancing obstacles generally to ensure that what is being measured as corruption is not just a generalized complaint about lack of access. 28. Indeed, the notion that consumer borrowing decisions are rationally made is undermined by clear evidence from an interesting experiment con-ducted recently in South Africa by a large consumer lender. Loan offers with randomized interest rates were mailed to some 50,000 customers, along with numerous variants of advertising material. The researchers (Bertrand and others 2005) found that loan demand was sensitive not only to the quoted interest rates but to several of the advertising devices. For example, including a photograph of a woman in the accompanying literature (as opposed to a man) was, in terms of its infl uence on loan take-up, equivalent to lowering the rate of interest by over 4 percentage points a month . 29. Extortionate or predatory behavior is particularly hard to de ne. In more than 30 years of operation, the U.K. legislation against \"extortionate lending\" led to only 10 successful claims by borrowers. New legislation enacted in 2006 broadens the criteria by which lending may be found \"unfair\" and thus illegal (U.K. Department of Trade and Industry 2003). 30. This could happen either by removing the ceiling altogether or by retain- ing it at a fairly high rate for licensed lenders. In Ireland the annual percentage rate of 200 percent still applies to licensed money lenders (compared with the traditional ceiling of 23 percent for unlicensed lenders). The 200 percent ceil-ing appears to be constraining at very short maturities for the main lenders in the high-risk market but not for maturities of several months or more (U.K. Competition Commission 2006). Of course much higher interest rates (in the millions of percent per year) have been documented all over the world in illegal or unregulated lending to unfortunate individuals. 31. Such requirements should not be too draconian, as where unfavorable registration on the national credit registry is enough to exclude a borrower from future loans. 32. Using an eight-year bank-level dataset for over 100 countries Micco, Panizza, and Ya\u00f1ez (2007) con rm that state-owned banks in developing coun- tries are less pro table than privately owned banks because of lower margins and higher overhead costs, even after controlling for the dynamics of ownership over time, most notably regarding privatization. The relationship is much weaker in FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 184 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 184 10/26/07 12:46:02 PM 10/26/07 12:46:02 PM185GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS developed countries. Of special interest is the nding that state-owned banks report higher pro ts in years of economic expansion compared to privately- owned banks, but they are much less pro table in election years, a result which, because it is driven by differences in net interest margins rather than overhead costs, points to loan losses (or debt forgiveness) in those years. 33. Even the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act may have had little effect, at least in its early years. Introduced in 1977, this law is sometimes pointed to as an example of a well-functioning directed credit program. Banks are rated on their \"efforts in determining community credit needs, marketing credit, participating in community development, maintaining branch of ces and avoiding discriminatory credit policies\" in low-income neighborhoods. But, at least before 1997-98, they were not assessed on whether they actually lent more to target groups. Indeed, Dahl, Evanoff, and Spivey (2000) found that banks whose performance under the law was downgraded did not respond by increasing the share of their lending to target groups. 34. Cole analyzed the allocation of agricultural credit from government- owned banks in India and found a strong suggestion of political infl uence. Across a sample of 412 districts in 19 Indian states in each year 1992-99 , and including 32 elections, he nds that not only did credit increase in election years but the election-year credit surge was greatest in the districts most closely contested. Given that it is state-level governments that appoint members of the coordinating committee for lending practices and policies, political pressure can be coming from different parties in different states even in the same year, a feature of the data that helped pinpoint likely political effects. 35. Using a sample of 22 developing countries with 10 banks from each country over the period 1993-2000, Din\u00e7 found that in the months before elections, government-owned banks increase their lending\u2014and the amount of loans restructured or overdue\u2014relative to privately owned banks. This sug-gests not only politically motivated lending at government-owned banks but also loan forgiveness before elections. 36. Khwaja and Mian analyzed all 112,685 business loan accounts at banks in Pakistan during 1996-2002 and uncovered strong circumstantial evidence of corruption at state-owned banks. The loan les contained the names of the borrowing companies' directors, which allowed the authors to link them with the names of all of the candidates in the 1993 and 1997 general elections. Fully one-quarter of the candidates were directors of borrowing rms. More important, their rms borrowed more, paid lower interest rates, and defaulted more often (a 24 percent default rate, compared with a 6 percent for others, even after inclusion of rm-level control variables). These effects proved to be entirely attributable to borrowing from state-owned banks\u2014implying sizable scal costs as well as the costs from misallocation of investable funds\u2014and they were larger, the more electorally successful the politician. The effects are smaller in districts with a healthier democratic process, as measured by voter turnout. FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 185 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 185 10/26/07 12:46:02 PM 10/26/07 12:46:02 ALL?

For some examples related to nancial access, see http://www.ifc.org/ ifcext/sme.nsf/Content/Publications. 39. Also see Dufl o and Kremer (2005) for a discussion of the relative merits of randomized evaluation and competitors such as propensity score testing and the difference-in-difference methods for estimating the partial equilibrium effects on bene ciaries of direct policy interventions. 40. The analysis of credit guarantee schemes displays some similarities and some contrasts with that of deposit insurance schemes (Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Kane 2002). In both types of schemes, the bene ts of expanding access have to be balanced with the moral hazard risk. Perhaps the main difference is that coverage of a credit guarantee scheme can be credibly limited, whereas deposit insurance guarantees tend to be extended to all depositors, especially in a crisis. In addition, pricing and other features of credit guarantees can more easily be made realistically risk-related. For example a sizable degree of coinsurance is the norm with credit guarantees, and coverage can vary. But, as is argued in the text, just as with deposit insurance, success is less likely in poor institutional environments. 41. Curiously, the large, publicly funded SHG-bank linkage program in India, which provides subsidized re nancing (by NABARD) of bank loans to self-help groups, directly bene ting about 14 million households, offers no loan-loss guarantee to the bank. 42. For example, government interventions in every one of the 25 EU member states involve subsidies or scal outlays, according to Dorn (2005); 47 EU schemes are reviewed by Gracey (2001). 43. Note, however, that this line of reasoning is more speci c than is often portrayed. Depending on the exact nature of project risks and of the informa-tion asymmetries between lenders and borrowers, there might even be more lending than is socially optimal (DeMeza and Webb 1987; Besley 1994). The successful operation of MFIs that charge high interest rates shows that this problem is not decisive in all markets. 44. Even in the United Kingdom, the stated purpose of the government's Small Firms' Loan Guarantee (SFLG) scheme has been simply the limited, instrumental one of assisting \"SMEs who have a viable business plan but lack the collateral necessary to secure the loan that they seek.\" 45. Even the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) long-established SME guarantee scheme (the so-called section 7a scheme) has been criticized for poor underwriting loss estimates (U.S. General Accounting Of ce 2001). Curiously, FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 186 FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 186 10/26/07 12:46:03 PM 10/26/07 12:46:03 PM187GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FACILITATING ACCESS though, the SBA erred on the conservative side in this matter; its actual underwrit- ing losses turned out to be considerably lower than had been budgeted. 46. The highly regarded Chilean FOGAPE scheme has increased its annual charge to between 1 and 2 percent of the loan amount depending on the claims performance of participating banks; to date, the charges have been suf cient to cover the administrative expenses of the scheme as well as claims (Benavente, Galetovic, and Sanhueza 2006; De la Torre, Gozzi, and Schmukler 2007). Schemes in Malaysia and Thailand have also required very little subsidy over the years. The long-running SBA section 7a program in the United States entails a one-time subsidy of only about 1.3 percent of the value of the guaranteed loans, including provision for calls on the guarantee and operating expenses. The annual subsidy for the Italian SGS system grew to about 1 percent by 2004. Other programs have had higher costs. The charges of between 0.5 and 4 percent of the sum guaranteed by Mexican schemes cover only about half of the operating costs and underwriting losses (Benavides and Huidobro 2005). The very large Korean KCGF charges between 0.5 percent and 2 percent depending on the borrower's credit rating, with an average of just over 1 percent, but this revenue covers only a fth of the scheme's outlays. Indeed the two major Korean schemes operated at a loss of almost 4 percent a year of the stock of outstanding guarantees in 2001-5 (Shim 2006). Over the years, the (much smaller) U.K. SFLG scheme\u2014which charges an annual 2 percent fee\u2014had experienced defaults on more than one in three of its guar-anteed loans, requiring a subsidy amounting in a recent year to 15 percent of gross new guarantees in that year (Graham 2004). 47. One recent attempt to use quantitative information to estimate addi- tionality is Zecchini and Ventura (2006), who compare data on some 4,000 Italian rms eligible for the SGS guarantee scheme and 6,000 controls\u2014 rms that were not eligible because of their sector. Estimating a regression equation explaining the level of bank borrowing by rm in terms of the rm's number of employees, sales, tangible and intangible assets, nonbank debt, net worth, and net earnings, they nd that, even after taking account of eligibility (using an instrumental variables technique), a rm's use of SGS guarantees is associated with a modestly higher level of bank borrowing (about 10-13 percent). Another econometric effort was made by KPMG Management Consulting (1999), but it looked only at assisted borrowers and did not include a control group. 48. The key natural experiment allowing identi cation of the effect of subsi- dized export credit was the removal of one important sector, cotton yarn, from eligibility for subsidy. Apparently the authorities wanted to concentrate available funds on export sectors with higher value added. The cotton yarn sector, which had accounted for over half of the 100,000 individual loans made in the scheme between 1998 and 2003, survived this removal with output and exports almost unaffected. While some smaller, unlisted rms without multiple banking rela- tionships were hit by the change, the larger rms just saw a reduction in their pro ts. An estimated one-half of the subsidized funds had gone to nancially FFA_143-188_ch04.indd 187 ALL? POLICIES AND PITFALLS IN EXPANDING ACCESS 188unconstrained rms that did not need it. Interestingly, it was not systematically the less-productive rms that were hit by the removal of the subsidy. 49. A third form is the wholesale guarantee of, for example, a bond issue by a specialized SME lender, a securitization of the underlying loans, or a block loan to a specialized lender by another intermediary. The Italian SGS provides counterguarantees on a wholesale basis to mutual guarantee associations for bank loans of their members. Accion International has had many years of expe-rience on a cross-country basis in wholesale guarantees of facilities provided to its local af liates. 50. This can be seen as an application of the increasingly fashionable idea of auctioning a block of subsidy funds to the highest bidder. In nance, the risk that the bene ciary will ultimately default, thereby eventually paying much less than she promised, makes auctioning of rather limited application. It can work in the case at hand, where the block of funds and the subsidy involved is only a small part of the bidder's business. 51. Chinese guarantee funds, some of which are publicly backed but result from regulatory arbitrage, were estimated to cover loans amounting to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2005 (Shim 2006). 52. Sometimes such measures can also be undermined by judicial decisions, as is illustrated by the case of payroll loans in Brazil, which were declared unconstitutional by a court, leading to higher borrowing costs (Costa and de Mello 2006). 53. The study of Braun and Raddatz (2007) provides an excellent example of this. Distinguishing between economic sectors that are more or less likely to favor nancial liberalization, the authors were able to show that in countries in which the economic power of the former grew (as a result of trade liberaliza-tion), subsequent nancial deepening was faster. 54. Speci cally, Kroszner and Strahan (1999) examined the removal of restrictions on branch banking. They trace the origin of these restrictions to the interest that 19th century state governments had in creating local banking monopolies that could be taxed. Resistance in the 20th century to deregulation came from the incumbent small banks, and indeed it was the states with many small banks that deregulated last. 55. They constructed an indicator of nancial liberalization encompassing credit and interest rate controls, entry barriers, restrictive regulations, govern-ment ownership, and restrictions on international nancial transactions. 56. From cross-country evidence from 38 countries they nd that greater political accountability is associated with higher entry in sectors that are more dependent on external capital and have greater growth opportunities.
