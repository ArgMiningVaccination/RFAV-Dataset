Dr. McLarry explains her process and what a visit with a Nautropathic Doctor is like My role as a naturopathic doctor Naturopathic doctors are guided by several key principals, my favorite is the Latin word \"Docere\" which means \"doctor as teacher\". It is my goal to provide my patients with a road map to better health. This means partnering with each individual patient and learning their story and their goals for well-being. As a guide and teacher for my patients, we work together to find the root cause of any dysfunction in the body and design individualized treatment protocols that will help you regain your optimal state of health. This is often a dynamic and evolving process that changes as you become more able to take control of your health. I empower you to become more informed about your healthcare options, more involved in making decisions about your health, and more capable of maintaining the best health possible. My protocols take an integrative, whole-body, approach to health, emphasizing less toxic substances that promote natural healing. If you have an existing doctor or health care protocol, often times I can enhance your care by expanding treatment options, proactively preventing side effects, and improving symptom control. My ultimate goal is to be a partner and guide on your journey to optimal health. What are visits with me like? A crucial part of my relationship with my patients is communication. Initially, one of the most important conversations we will have revolves around getting to know you...your lifestyle, nutrition preferences, work and leisure activities, current and past stressors, environmental influences, genetics, and relevant diagnoses and injuries. You can expect to spend 1-2 hours at our first visit, telling me all about what is important to you and how I can fit into your health care plan. Together we will evaluate all of the factors that affect your health and create a treatment plan especially designed for your specific needs. Based on your treatment plan, some visits may involve lab work, treatment modalities such as injections, IV therapy, detoxification therapies, specialized testing, and nutrition analysis. At times I may recommend supplementation or medication if needed. As we work together we will incorporate new therapies and eliminate ones that are no longer needed, so that you have a dynamic treatment plan aimed at moving you forward on your journey to the healthiest you possible. What will a treatment plan entail? Your treatment plan will be as individual as you are. The tests, therapies and protocols will be entirely based on the symptoms that are coming up for you at that specific time. At the core of each plan will be designs to improve your overall well-being and correct any physiological dysfunctions or imbalances in your body. As your body becomes stronger and more balanced, your treatment will shift to maintaining optimal health. Many plans will include dietary modifications, targeted supplement therapies (oral, IV or both), modalities to enhance detoxification pathways, specific recommendations for exercise, and in some cases medications to help mitigate symptoms while we work on the root cause of illness. The treatment plan will be a road map that we come up with together, that can be implemented successfully in a step wise fashion that goes at a pace that is comfortable for you. "}
