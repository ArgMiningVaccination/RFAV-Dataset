President Xi Jinping arrived at the main venue of the Great Hall of the People at around 5:00 p.m. Beijing time and waved to Putin, who had joined in from the main venue of the Kremlin. Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Head of the National Development and Reform Commission He Lifeng co-chaired the ceremony with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Responsible officials of relevant departments and local governments, and constructor representatives of China and Russia attended the ceremony from the sub-venue of Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, sub-venue of Xudapu Nuclear Power Plant in Huludao City, Liaoning Province, and two Russian sub-venues in the Building of Moscow Government, and Nuclear Machinery Factory in Rostov. The responsible persons of the companies of both countries reported on the progress of the project to the two heads of state. Xi and Putin delivered their speeches respectively. Xi extended congratulations on the launch of the China-Russia nuclear energy cooperation project and paid high respect to the constructors from the two countries. Xi Jinping said, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the China-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. I and President Putin have agreed to advance the bilateral relations to a higher level and expand the ties to broader fields. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic unseen in a century, China and Russia have firmly supported each other and cooperated closely and effectively, which is a vivid demonstration of the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era. Xi stressed, energy cooperation has always been the most important area of practical cooperation which generates the largest achievement and covers the widest scope between the two countries. Nuclear energy is the strategic priority for bilateral cooperation and a series of major projects have been completed and put into operation. The four nuclear power units that kicked off construction today mark another major landmark in China-Russia nuclear energy cooperation. Xi put forward a three-point proposal. First, we should adhere to the principle of safety first and set a model for global nuclear energy cooperation. It is necessary to construct and operate the four units with high quality and high standards, create a global benchmark in nuclear safety, give full play to complementary advantages, expand and deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on nuclear energy, and contribute more to the development of the global nuclear energy industry. Second, we should deepen scientific and technological cooperation on nuclear energy by sticking to the driving force of innovation. We should deepen cooperation on the basic research, key technology R&D, and transformation of innovative achievements in the field of nuclear energy, such as nuclear environmental protection, nuclear medicine, nuclear fuel and advanced nuclear power technology, so as to promote the deep integration of the nuclear energy industry and the new generation of digital technology, and contribute more wisdom to the innovative development of nuclear energy globally. Third, we should adhere to strategic collaboration to promote the coordinated development of the global energy governance system. It's necessary to promote the building of a global energy governance system featuring justice, equity, balance, inclusiveness, openness and shared benefits, and contribute more solutions to global energy governance. Responding to climate change is a common task for all countries. China and Russia should promote more low-carbon cooperation projects and play a constructive role in achieving global sustainable development goals. Putin expressed warm congratulations on the start of the construction of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant and the Xudapu Nuclear Power Plant. Russia has the confidence to work with China to smoothly and safely advance the project's construction. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the China-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. Russia-China relations reach the best level in history. The consensus reached between President Xi and I has been well implemented with increasingly broader cooperation areas. Cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy marks a significant part of the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era between the two countries, and I believe that the start of the four nuclear power units will not only inject new vitality into the further development of Russia-China relations but also help achieve the goals to peak carbon dioxide emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. It will also contribute to coping with global climate change and realizing the sustainable development of humanity. The Chinese representatives at the sub-venue of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant and the sub-venue of the Xudapu Nuclear Power Plant then reported to the two heads of state that preparations for the start of construction are completed. President Xi issued the instruction \"Start!\" The Russian representatives reported to the two heads of state that the equipment is ready to be installed. President Putin issued the instruction \"Start!\" The project was officially launched as the first tank of cement was poured at the construction site of the power plants. Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi attended the ceremony. Units 7 and 8 of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant and units 3 and 4 of the Xudapu Nuclear Power Plant are the significant project in a package cooperation deal on nuclear energy. It was signed with a witness by the two heads of state in June 2018. When completed and put into operation, the annual power generation will reach 37.6 billion kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30.68 million tons per year. "}
