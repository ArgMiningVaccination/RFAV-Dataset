High in antioxidants and rich in colourless carotenoids, this powerhouse in a pill is made from special, non-GMO crystal tomatoes in a unique formulation supported by a decade of research. Safe and effective, with no preservatives and no harmful side effects, Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is highly recommended by millions of users worldwide and is dramatically all-natural. CLINICALLY TESTED FORMULATIONS = REAL RESULTS A study conducted at National Skin Centre in Singapore highlights the result of the Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. When used in tandem with Skin Clarity Cream, significant improvements were achieved after only 56 days. Improvements further increased to over 50% after 84 days. The results were published in the peer-reviewed US Journal of Pigmentary Disorders. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is a natural food supplement made from a special non-GMO varietal of tomato cultivated specifically for skin lightening. We call this varietal Crystal Tomato which is not available anywhere else. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is natural and preservative-free. Crystal Tomato carotenoids are the key active ingredient in Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. Carotenoids are a class of natural substances made up of naturally occurring pigments synthesised by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. Carotenoids function primarily as antioxidants. Carotenoids are usually coloured, such as beta carotene\u2014the orange in carrots\u2014and lycopene\u2014the bright red in tomatoes. Crystal Tomato carotenoids are colourless and do not absorb the visible light spectrum. They absorb only lower wavelengths like UV or higher wavelengths infrared or IR. A fresh crystal tomato contains 300 times more bio-accessible rare colourless carotenoids than an ordinary tomato. It would take 300 common market tomatoes to produce the equivalent of colourless carotenoids in a single Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. Because they contain coloured carotenoids, consuming regular tomatoes will not produce the same whitening effect nor protect skin from UV. Furthermore, ingesting large amounts of coloured carotenoids will affect skin colour. Beta carotene, taken in large amounts over a couple of weeks,will eventually give skin an orange tint. Recommended intake is one to two caplets a day. In view that the skin is a large organ, with benefits delivered head to toe, expect visible lightening in two to three months. Some users attest to visible lightening in as early as three weeks of taking one caplet a day. Most can see skin radiance after a couple of weeks. A study conducted at Singapore National Skin Centre (Study dated October 2013 to May 2014) has shown that after 56 days, 76.5% of patients showed a remarkable improvement. Unless you have a tomato allergy, there are no known side effects. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is a natural food supplement which consists of natural crystal tomatoes and L-cysteine, an amino acid present in the body as well as a US FDA-approved food additive. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is as safe as eating a tomato. As a natural food supplement, it is suitable and safe for all\u2014with the exception of those who are allergic to tomatoes or have been advised by their physicians not to consume tomatoes for any reason. As a natural food supplement, you can take Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement indefinitely. If the supplement is stopped, skin will eventually revert to its original state. It will not get worse, but benefits achieved from the supplement will be lost. Yes. It is suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is made from natural crystal tomatoes that have been freeze-dried into powder. As acids are water-soluble, when water is removed, the acids are also removed. No further chemicals are added. L-cysteine is an efficacy booster. This amino acid increases the liver'sproduction of master antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione converts dark brownmelanin to pink melanin. Not all glutathione can be absorbed by the body; only L-cysteine-transformed glutathione is absorbed. A study conducted at Singapore National Skin Centre (Study dated October 2013 to May 2014), a 20% increase in natural skin SPF occurred in 65% of participants after 12 weeks of taking Crystal Tomato carotenoids. It is necessary to continue using topical sunscreen. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement provides some protection, but it is not sufficient to completely protect skinfrom direct sun exposure. Just like eating a fresh tomato, Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement can be taken any time of day or night, before or after food. Whichever way you take it, we recommend that you develop the habit of taking it daily at the same time. |Crystal Tomato\u00ae Powder||800mg| |L-Cysteine||50mg| stearate, Croscarmellose sodium, Silicon dioxide, Opadry AMB White.
