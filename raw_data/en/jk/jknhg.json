Notwithstanding, the Canadian Chiropractic Association recognizes that vaccination is a safe and effective public health practice for the prevention of infectious diseases. Members are encouraged to refer all patient questions, consultation and education regarding immunization and vaccinations to the appropriate public health authorities and/or health professional whose scope of practice includes vaccination. By way of background the CCA explains how the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam, contacted the CCA about the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. As a result, the CCA began conversations with chiropractic leaders, including provincial regulators, and the Public Health Agency of Canada with a view to updating its position statement. The CCA's Board of Directors approved the updated statement in September 2019. Since then, Dr. Tam has met with a group of chiropractic leaders to discuss the importance of this public health practice and identify ways to collaborate in the future. The CCA states that it looks forward to partnering with Dr. Tam on this and other public health issues. The CCA represents over 85% of the 9000 chiropractors "}
