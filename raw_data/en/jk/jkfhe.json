Our natural and organic pest solutions are the same environmentally-friendly products used by pest control professionals to give you the same control over many pests as more powerful chemical products. In today's society there is a big emphasis on using natural, organic, non-toxic, or \"green\" products. In the pest control industry each of these terms can mean something very different. Before starting a pest control program one should consider what their goal actually is. Is the goal to use only organic products (organic food processing facilities)? Is the goal to use only natural products? Or is the goal to institute a program that is environmentally friendly? Natural pest control products have grown in popularity over the past several years, bringing new all natural and organic products that are safer than and just as effective as professional grade chemically based products. Organic pest control products offer an excellent alternative to chemical pest control for the environmentally conscious, using 100% all-natural ingredients to protect the health of people, pets, and the environment. Here at DoMyOwn we sell a variety of professional brands such as EcoSmart, Nisus, MotherEarth and more. Choose dusts such as [diatomaceous earth](https://www.domyown.com/diatomaceous-earth-c-114_357.html), baits containing new Reduced-Risk chemicals with ultra-low toxicity, and traps that are completely chemical-free. A natural pesticide is made up of materials that occur in nature and are left virtually unchanged for our use. Most of these products contain materials that are derived from plants, but several products also contain minerals - mostly dust products. Natural is not the same thing as organic. A natural product may or may not be organic depending on how the product was made. An organic pesticide is a product produced in accordance with The Organic Act and its regulations. An organic pesticide, like natural pesticides, are made up of materials that occur in nature and are left virtually unchanged for our use. And just like natural products, organic products are also \"toxic\", though they may have a low toxicity rate for warm blooded animals. (At a certain level, just about any chemical will have a toxic effect on warm blooded animals, even water). Many people make the mistake of assuming that \"natural\" automatically means safe or safer to use than other synthetic products. This is not true. Arsenic is a natural product yet is not considered environmentally friendly or safe for use around homes. Simply put, NO. If a product, be it organic, natural or synthetic will kill an insect (by any other means than mechanical) it is \"toxic.\" There are, however, a wide range of products on the market, both natural and synthetic, that have a low order of toxicity for warm-blooded mammals making them safer to use. Many pests can also be caught with glue board traps, snap traps or they can be mechanically eliminated (think fly swatter), all non-toxic options. The idea of a green pest control program is not limited to using natural or organic insecticides. There are no set guidelines for green pest control, but one should use a holistic approach when considering starting an environmentally friendly pest control program in their home or business. Go Green with IPM. Using Integrated Pest Management or IPM is a great way to start a green pest control program. We have a very informative article that explains step-by-step how to do IPM, just follow this link to the article: [Integrated Pest Management](https://www.domyown.com/integrated-pest-management-ipm-what-is-ipm-a-396.html). The goal for using a green pest management program is to reduce the use of chemical treatment. This can be accomplished by following [IPM steps 1-5](https://www.domyown.com/integrated-pest-management-ipm-what-is-ipm-a-396.html). There may still be instances where a chemical treatment is needed. In that case, a product that poses the lowest risk to the environment but is still strong enough to kill the target pest should be used. This is the number one seller in the natural pest control market, and with good reason. This naturally occurring substance contains the fossilized remains of tiny animals known as diatoms. When seen under a microscope, the reason for this product's bug killing power becomes clear. It is in fact a highly abrasive powder that causes irreversible and fatal damage to the exoskeleton of any insects that come into contact with it. This leads to dehydration and death within hours or days of contacting the powder. The good news however is that because this powder only damages the bodies of insects, it is one hundred percent safe to use in any setting in the home. It is completely harmless to both children and pets, and will not stain or damage any furniture or clothing like some chemical pesticides can. However when applying it, you will want to make sure that the area is kept dry, as it will not be as effective if it should get wet or damp. Like diatomaceous earth, [boric acid](https://www.domyown.com/boric-acid-c-114_122.html) acts as a desiccant, meaning that it attacks the exterior shell of insects such as roaches and ants, and releases precious moisture that they need to live. Again, like other powdered desiccants, it should be kept dry wherever it is applied to have the greatest effect. It also provides insect killing power without posing any threat to the health and well-being of domestic animals, children or anyone else in the home. We carry many [pesticide-free traps](https://www.domyown.com/pesticidefree-traps-c-31_381.html) that are safer to use around children and pets. Many of these kinds of traps use some kind of sticky glue to catch [rodents](https://www.domyown.com/rodents-c-21.html) and insects. These traps are popular because of their ability to catch pests without having to leave pesticide-based traps lying around the house. We also carry some [natural and organic bait products](https://www.domyown.com/baits-c-31_380.html) that are very effective for controlling several kinds of insects from [roaches](https://www.domyown.com/roaches-c-2.html) to [ants](https://www.domyown.com/ants-c-1.html). Not only does this make them less harmful to the environment, but also more effective, as the targeted insects are more likely to be enticed by something they cannot distinguish from their regular sources of food.
