I have been taking the consultanaturopath.com line of high potency vitamins and am very happy with them. The capsules are smaller and have no funky smell or aftertaste. I give my children the supreme greens powder by the same line. It's tasteless and easy to sneak into any drink. Mom for the win! 5 stars for both the Drs. and supplements! Rachele, A. 29 - Sandpoint, ID I went to several doctors before trying this service. I actually felt like the staff, the doctors care about my health and not just about making money. I cannot thank them enough for making feel like there is hope in feeling better. Jessica 42 They will always do what is best for you and your family. Dr Jeremiah is a very good listener and is always eager to help what ails ya. I highly suggest them if you are sick of conventional medicine that is making you sicker. Vanessa "}
