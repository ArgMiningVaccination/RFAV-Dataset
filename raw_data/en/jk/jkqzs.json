General Info Who can I contact if I have a question about COVID safety in the workplace? If any employee has concerns about the COVID safety of their workspace, please contact your [COVID safety liaison](https://publicsafety.lmu.edu/environmentalhealthsafety/returntowork/). Where can I find the most updated information regarding LMU's return to campus? TLMU continues to align with L.A. County Public Health and Cal/OSHA guidelines and protocols, and best practices issued by the state of California and the CDC. This A-Z Indes is your comprehensive resource for up-to-date information on LMU's COVID policies. You may also view current and cumulative COVID-19 data at the [LMU COVID Dashboard](https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/dashboard/). Illness What should I do if I'm feeling sick? If you [exhibit ] [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) do not come to campus (or leave your on-campus residence) or attend in-person classes/meetings until you obtain a negative COVID-19 test, are fever-free for 24 hours, and your symptoms have improved without the use of medication. Follow these 4 steps: - Seek medical attention. Students may schedule a telehealth appointment or message with a Student Health Services provider via [myhealth.lmu.edu](https://myhealth.lmu.edu). Staff and faculty should contact their medical provider. - Get tested. COVID-19 at-home rapid tests are available free of charge to members of the LMU community. Learn more, including where to pick one up, [here](https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/on-campuscovid-19testingcenter/). You are also welcome to take an antigen test or a PCR test through your medical provider, an L.A. County community test site, or other testing location. Note: Negative results do not preclude the possibility of infection as viral load may be undetectable in the initial days of COVID infection. - Stay home and isolate yourself. While you await your COVID test/results and even if you test negative - do not leave your residence or socialize with others until you are fever-free and symptoms have subsided for 24 hours. This includes going to class, work, and eating in the dining halls. Do your best to isolate away from your household members - avoid sharing a room and bathroom if at all possible. If you must enter common areas in your residence, wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet away from others, and keep doors and windows open if possible to facilitate air flow. - After you seek medical care, if your doctor believes you have COVID-19 or you have received a positive COVID-19 test, please immediately [isolate](https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/matrix/#isolation), and contact the [LMU COVID Support Team](https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/covidsupportteam/)for further instructions and resources. Isolation/Exposure [LMU strictly adheres the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Guidance for Exposure Management for Institutes of Higher Education and the Health Officer Order.] What do I do if I'm exposed to COVID-19? If you have recently been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, - If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should use antigen tests to make sure you have not gotten re-infected. - If you do not have symptoms of COVID-19: Testing is not recommended if your first positive test was 30 days ago or less. Testing is recommended (but not required) if your first positive test was 31-90 days ago. If you do test, you should use an antigen test. Notes: - Close Contacts are now defined by the size of the venue shared with an infected individual, regardless of masking: - Outdoors: L.A. County Public Health does not consider outdoor exposure, even within 6 feet with or without masks, as close contact. - COVID positive is defined as an individual who has a positive diagnostic swab or saliva viral test for COVID-19 or whose healthcare provider thinks they have COVID-19. Note: an individual who has had COVID-19 in the past 90 days may continue to test positive on a PCR test even when they are no longer infectious. If an individual who had COVID-19 in the last 90 days has a new positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 and is asymptomatic, they are not presumed to have COVID-19 and are instructed to talk with their doctor to obtain a diagnosis. What happens if an individual has COVID? If a student, faculty, staff, contractor, or visitor has COVID-19 (meaning they have tested positive for COVID-19 using a rapid antigen test, a PCR test, or their healthcare provider otherwise diagnoses them as infectious with COVID-19) they are required to report their positive test to the [COVID Support Team](https://www.lmu.edu/together/resources/covidsupportteam/) and isolate immediately.* Those with COVID-19 should notify the COVID Support Team using the online form [here](https://mylmu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9o8PnRJfOzEmMke). It is the students' responsibility to communicate the illness-related absence with their faculty and on-campus employer, as applicable. It is the employees' responsibility to communicate the illness-related absence with their manager. The COVID Support Team will provide coordination with Student Housing for those who live on campus, and with HR for employees. Isolation Instructions In accordance with L.A. County Public Health [isolation instructions](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidisolation/) and campus protocol, individuals must adhere to the following isolation instructions: - Stay home through day 5 (at a minimum - see clearance criteria below) and separate yourself from others in your household until your home isolation ends. (Note: Day 0 is the date of symptom onset or the date the positive test was collected, whichever comes first.) - Student residents in university housing are provided with a dedicated isolation space and support, coordinated by Student Housing. - Do not leave your residence except for essential medical care. - When obtaining medical care, drive yourself, if possible. If you cannot drive yourself, keep as much distance as possible between you and the driver and others by sitting in the back seat, leaving the windows down and wearing a well-fitted mask. If you do not have a mask, wear a cloth face covering. - If someone from outside your household is shopping for you, ask them to leave the food and other supplies at your door and pick them up after the person has left. - If you must share a bathroom with others in your household, do your best to clean all surfaces after each use, and open the window to maximize ventilation if possible. Isolation Clearance Criteria An individual is cleared from isolation and may resume normal activity, including returning to class and work, as early as day 6 and by day 11 when they meet the following three criteria: - Fever-free for at least 24 hours (without fever-reducing medication), AND - Symptoms are mild and improving, and no new symptoms, AND For those who meet the clearance criteria, and leave isolation between days 6 - 10, you must wear a well-fitted mask through day 10 when around others. You may stop wearing a well-fitted mask on day 11 or sooner if you have two negative COVID-19 tests in a row that were taken at least a day a part. For students who live in university housing: For the health and safety of our residential community and because it is unsafe to wear a mask when sleeping, when cleared to leave isolation, students must continue to sleep in their designated isolation space (or off-campus if they are not isolating in a designated university isolation space) through day 10 or until they have two negative COVID-19 tests in a row that were taken at least a day a part. *Note: If an individual has had COVID in the last 30 days, they are instructed by L.A. County Public Health and the CDC to avoid testing for 30 days from symptom onset or the date their positive test was collected since they may continue to test positive even though they are not infectious. As such, those who have had COVID in the past 30 days and test positive during that 30-day period are exempt from isolation unless the individual is symptomatic or has been diagnosed with COVID by their physician. The COVID Support Team will work with these individuals to provide individualized guidance. Test Kits LMU offers free at-home rapid antigen COVID test kits to students, faculty, staff, and contractors. Check the [ LMU COVID-19 Testing webpage](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9jthue/5oar7bb/9zhvxs) for additional details, including where to pick up complimentary tests, during both operational hours and after hours. Vaccine Requirements [Effective May 18, 2023 LMU no longer requires COVID-19 vaccinations for students, faculty, or staff. This change is aligned with guidance from public health authorities and applies to the original dose and subsequent boosters(s) (per ] [state](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/covid-19/order-of-the-state-public-health-officer-health-care-worker-vaccine-requirement.aspx) and [federal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/01/the-biden-administration-will-end-covid-19-vaccination-requirements-for-federal-employees-contractors-international-travelers-head-start-educators-and-cms-certified-facilities/) recommendations). May I ask a community member about their vaccination status? No, a community member's vaccination status is a private matter and protected by HIPAA and FERPA. Asking an individual to disclose their vaccination status is not permitted. "}
