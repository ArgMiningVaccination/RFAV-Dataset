On the surface he's a traveling merchant, but actually he's a con artist. Behind this identity, he secretly researches alchemy and is knowledgeable in both alchemy and medicine. He likes excitement but does not enjoy getting dragged into trouble himself, so he usually finds a way to watch the conflicts he stirs up from the sidelines. He's full of lies and avoids showing his true feelings, but if there's something he's interested in, he'll have a strong desire to get it. Food Introduction While there's some dispute about the origins of whisky, one thing agreed upon is that the name means \"water of life\". Early on it was probably used to stave off chill and dull pain. The earliest ingredients to make the \"water of life\" are also not clear, but these days whisky has become beloved the world over for its fragrant malty flavor.

I. Prelude of a Funeral Miles and miles of cloudless sky; the seasonal toll of the clock bell, and the ruckus of the people gathered on this barren land. At first, it didn't match the scenery. But now, their faces were brimming with happy smiles. There was an abundance of flower wine in this street, which was still stuck in winter time. The accumulated snow had yet to be cleared, and red carpets were hastily rolled out. The traveler, who had happened to come to this town, watched the joyous scenery before him and asked: \"What's this spectacular celebration? Is today some kind of special date?\" The traveler did not get the answer he waited for. At that moment, a slender shadow appeared from the silent street behind the traveler, and blood red eyes hid an indecipherable, icy-cold smile. \"No, this is a funeral. A funeral to bury this kingdom's past.\" \"Eh? Funeral....?\" The rings of the clock bell continued to reverberate, and only when the traveler turned around, in hopes of more asking more questions, that person had disappeared. A number of years later. This place has become a peaceful kingdom full of daisy flowers. Quiet and auspicious, there are no hardships from war and there are no oppressors. It all seemed just as beautiful as that person's dream of a fairy tale nation. \"If lies allow one to achieve happiness, it becomes a fairy tale.\" I still remember the way that person would laugh as they spoke, whilst gazing at the sky. The wish that never came true back then has become today's reality- would that person be happy? Heh, even if that sort of talk was false, that person would still believe it, right? Looking at this long unrecognized, once barren town, I couldn't help but smile. The king here is different from the previous ruler; he's a loving and peaceful human. His kindness and diligence made him beloved by the citizens, even his Food Soul is said to be praised as a symbol of peace. But even so, there are still matters that he has no way of solving. That would be the king's daughter\u2014Princess Ilya's long uncured illness. Ever since she was a child, the princess's body has been weak and afflicted with ailments, and so the entire kingdom put up notices to enlist any person who knew how to treat disease. I quietly looked at the aged and blurry words on the piece of vellum. The mottled marks on the paper tell me that it's been a long time, and no one dares to take down these notices. But for me, this is an invitation to uncover the prologue. Upon taking down the notice, I was quickly brought to the palace by guards. The simple and elegant palace has only the carvings of intricate patterns on its bare walls; it seems to me that those extravagant decorations have disappeared without a trace. Even the person sitting upon the throne looked amiable this way. Peace does exist in this kingdom, I firmly believed so. At the same time, I also hate it. But no matter what kind of nation, there will always be maggots foraging; and I'm best at discovering these sorts of humans. \"Do you have any way to cure our princess?\" That was the simpering man standing beside the king, pretending to consider me. The truth is, he doesn't care who I am, as he never believed I could cure the princess from the very start. But it's exactly this kind of hypocritical human that can become my best chess piece. \"I am unsure if Your Majesty has ever heard of alchemy before?\" As I spoke, I politely bowed to the king. \"Alchemy?! You're.....?!!!\" \"My name is Vita, though I'm just a traveling merchant, I happened to acquire something interesting during my travels. I believe it can certainly help you cure Her Highness.\" \"Hmph! How many people do you think have come here before, promising such guarantees?!\" That hypocritical man seems to feel my disregard towards him; his tone is even more impatient than before. I do not answer his question. Instead, I opened the box in my hand. \"This.... This is?\" Watching the two golden snakes, entwining in my hands, the astounded look in their eyes quickly shifted to a kind of joy. \"Were these made with alchemy?\" \"Simply put, alchemy is used to create these sorts of substances.\" It's as I thought, they believed my words to be the truth. \"However, all this would require some time to prepare...\" II. Godless Prattling Humans are particularly fascinating things. If the body of Food Souls are composed of Dream Energy, so to speak, then humans are composed of a collection of pure desires. Desires so pure that they'd wish to swallow existences other than themselves. After gaining their trust, that hypocritical man quickly had a change of heart towards me. It's after I proposed more time for preparations that the kind king happily agreed to my request. At the same time, that man also volunteered to tend to me during these times. It was also then that I learned that he was the king's younger brother\u2014 Prince Karl. \"Mr. Vita is clearly a merchant, never thought you'd also have medical knowledge.\" \"I just know a little bit, that's all.\" \"Is it because you've worked this kind of job somewhere before?\" \"Be it medicine or alchemy, they all serve as my bargaining chip so I may strike more business deals.\" \"Business deals?\" \"Yes, have you forgotten? I'm a merchant~ Now then, what item is worth the most in making deals?\" I gently tapped the side of my head, hoping it would get some thinking capability out of the man's decaying brain. \"Money? Treasure? Or power?\" \"Hehe.... It's life. No one can avoid death, isn't that right?\" As I watched this greedy eyed human, I slightly deepened my voice. My words caught the man's attention, as expected; his expression momentarily froze up, and then I casually turned my head away. \"However, even if it's like this, it's because of people's many viewpoints that the value of life varies so much.\" \"That's natural, people have always been divided. That's also the reason why I'm here, it's proof that I will eventually become king.\" \"What you said isn't wrong, for it will all be arranged by fate......\" It was obvious Prince Karl heard the answer he wanted from me; he unceremoniously drew closer to me, defenseless; mockingly smiling as he spoke: \"Well then Mr. Vita, are you willing to strike a deal with me?\" \"Of course, I am a businessman.\" A smile unknowingly surfaced to the corner of my lips. And so, I believed in neither fate nor god. In this kingdom surrounded by daisy flowers, even the interior of the palace is full of pure white flowers. And so, it was only when that smeared blue shadow flashed by in the corner of my eyes did it stand out as it did. \"Hey, stop being difficult with me. This is a gift from the neighboring country to His Majesty, you can't break it!\" \"I'm just going to let Her Highness see it for a bit, I'll give it back soon! Don't worry!!!\" The golden-haired teenager was chased by what seemed to be an adult servant, his hearty laughter piercing the peaceful quietness of before. \"It's that Pizza again, I don't know what my brother was thinking, letting some random Food Soul muck around all day in the palace.\" \"A Food Soul, huh?\" \"Something wrong, Mr. Vita?\" Looking at that innocent, naive smile on his face, I suddenly thought of something interesting. \"So... that's him, huh...?\" Humans are good at betrayal. Many times before, I had reminded that person of this. \"Why do you think you're here today?\" \"Isn't this sort of life good? The me of the past was busy studying, thinking that I needed to become independent as soon as possible so I could handle political affairs, so I could help my aging king father earlier, so I could protect my little sister.\" \"She's replaced you as monarch now.\" \"Yes, perhaps because I owe her. It's because of me she doesn't have a healthy body, and she didn't get the love she deserved.\" \"Owe her, huh? You were both clearly born together, even your appearances are similar. How could she hate you?\" I carried the bowl of poison, gradually eroding her body, laughing as I spoke. My Master Attendant gave this to me; I know this medicine isn't lethal, but it would gradually cause weakness. \"Say, do you think the people of this country are living prosperously right now?\" Closing this storybook that she's finished again and again, she showed no signs of hesitation as she drank the medicine; before suddenly, inexplicably, asking me that question. \"If I said they are?\" \"Then I'll believe you.\" \"Hehe, it sounds like you don't really believe that, do you?\" \"It's impossible for me to know the answer, right? That's why I'm choosing to trust you, standing before me.\" Trust... me, huh....? What an amusing joke. \"Doing this can severe a Soul Contract but simultaneously control a Food Soul, right?\" \"If I said that was true?\" The same phrasing, but this time, it wasn't in that person's tiny attic atop a high tower. Instead it was Prince Karl's mansion. \"Then naturally, it's worth a try.\" He quickly took the black dagger from my hand, staring intently at it, his gaze never leaving its sight. Then, which in front of him does he exactly believe: me or the dagger? Truthfully, this is nothing more than an experiment, even I don't know if success is guaranteed. But it's only if an object cannot be differentiated between fake or real, does it become a worthy lie. What's interesting is how, if a human has self-generated hope in something, no matter how unrealistic, they would still willingly believe in it. Soon enough, that man will summon the Food Soul called Cassata, and then he'll be positioned to the king's side, all according to plan. III. Endless Night To many people, waiting on time is meaningless. But for that king, it's enough to be considered torture, consuming his mind. Often times, human emotions are blinding, similar to illnesses. And so, the next time I appear, the king's eyes held even more expectations than the first time they met. \"Mr. Vita is a travelling merchant. Because he has gone to many countries, he's picked up an unknown mysterious skill. One joyful thing is that it might be able to heal the Princess.\" \"God was concerned about Her Highness, that's why I was able to meet you.\" I once again entered [[1]](#cite_note-1) the palace, but I didn't think I'd meet him so quickly. \"Your Majesty, this is?\" \"My Food Soul, his name is Pizza.\" It seems the king truly did favor this Food Soul called Pizza, like a father pouring out his love for this Food Soul. It's just that Pizza was regarding me with some wariness...Well, it'd be more appropriate to use fear, right? Speaking of which, on occasion, small and weak animals possess these unexpectedly useful instincts~ \"His flag...... It looks rather nice....\" That bright smile, that made one want to tear it off, from just now disappeared without a trace on his face. How wonderful~ For him to use such suspicious eyes to look at me, that expression makes one quite happy. The same pure eyes like that person, I could even see myself in those lakewater green pupils. I'm disgusted by overly pure things. That kind of existence only makes me want to taint it even more. After those eyes made contact with me, they quickly moved away from my line of sight. \"Ah..... Thank- Thank you.\" Pizza gripped onto the flag in his hands, as if that would give him even the slightest sense of security. I couldn't help but laugh. This really was a character that could only appear in that person's favorite story~ Afterwards, the king arranged for my living quarters inside the palace, and Pizza would often go there to get the medicine. Although it's interesting to see Pizza's fear-distorted expression, I wasn't planning on revealing myself so soon. The days went by slowly; Pizza too slowly went from just standing by the door, waiting, to occasionally walking around the room as he pleased. \"Mr. Vita, you seem so young, but it feels like you know a lot of things?\" \"Is that so? It's probably because of my time, it's stopped long ago.\" It stopped the moment that person left. \"Stopped?\" \"How has the princess's body been recently?\" I pulled away from the topic, of course I never expected Pizza to understand my words. \"Slightly better than before. Speaking of which, are you a doctor, Mr. Vita?\" \"Doctor?\" What a \"noble\" title. A shame that I don't like it. \"I am but a simple merchant.\" The Whisky of now is here out of his own selfish desire. Ever since that person left, I looked into all the medical books left behind by my Master Attendant. But I could not find a way to meet that person. And so, I used everything around me, going through many years of searching before I discovered alchemy, long forgotten by humans. It just so happens that this place can become my first experimental field. According to the book's writings, the first step in alchemy is \"Deconstruction\", returning metal into pure sulfur and mercury, then extracting the potentiality of the metals, before merging them anew to achieve a new metal. All life in this world is composed of Dream Energy, and Food Souls are the closest material akin to the \"seed\" of Dream Energy. Of course, I brought this joyful news to the kind-hearted and generous king. \"So there's... no other way?\" After the king heard of this news, he sat in the chair of his study room. As he asked in an almost begging tone, his mind darted from one thought to the next. \"Pizza... He and Ilya are the same, they're both my beloved children.\" \"I am also deeply sorrowed by this Your Majesty. But I think this is the best method right now.\" I quietly suggested at the king's ear. To become so shaken from just using one Food Soul, the weak human; If he knew that after the experiment's success, his Food Soul would kill his own people, he would destroy his own kingdom, what sort of interesting expression would he make? \"Once the princess dies, you have no way of seeing her again. But Food Souls are not the same; even if they dissipate, they can still be summoned back once more...... Don't you think this is a great proposal?\" \"Pizza...Pizza...\" The withered king only continuously repeated Pizza's name; his tears would not stop flowing down the corners of his slowly dulling eyes, losing any life. During this period where I was not just responsible for the princess's daily medicine, I also had the \"fortune\" of altering the king's food and drink. His frail resolve destroyed his remaining reasoning and his useless love; the more he struggled, the more painful it became. Compared to the death of a physical body, a depraved soul is even more unrecoverable. \"What do you think then, Your Majesty?\" Loud thunder broke out in the sky once, and a flash of light shone upon the king's face, showing relief. \"....Then I'll leave it to you, Mr. Vita.\" In the end, humans know only how to comply with their most primal desires. And at that moment, it means his spirit has died. \"My pleasure, Your Majesty.\" Outside, thunder roared. Even the lightning breaking through the sky could not stop the encroaching darkness. It's there that I hide myself, waiting for that slightest glimmer of light to be engulfed by this endless night sky. IV. Meeting You Although I went through some small foreseeable incidents, I was still successful in taking away Pizza. As I left the palace to arrive at the mansion where I used to reside, Prince Karl seemed to have already taken control, as he was beginning to continuously gather up his own rebel army. The actors and scripts have been promptly prepared. I know what will happen next on this stage. However, none of them have anything to do with me. The fake peace has already been destroyed. Right now, I just want to see that person one more time. Seconds and minutes passed. I stared at the dim surroundings. How much time has passed since then? I continuously tried all sorts of methods and strategies to break Pizza's resolve, but from start to finish, I still can't find the right seed. Watching the motionless Pizza, lying on the frigid stone platform, even during sleep he looks like he's smiling. Such unprovoked irritability only serves to deepen my disgust. It was only when I relentlessly cut his skin open with a knife that I could see his pain-contorted expression. Heh... This really dampens my mood. The time it took for the experiment to finish was taking longer than I thought, so I left for the outside corridors. At the moment, the dark clouds have long cleared away, and only the lone moonlight was left behind. I stared at the palace, not too far away. It no longer had that tall church tower with the old clock, nor was that cage-like building there anymore. But a past event easily emerged before my eyes. \"Surely this unfortunate destiny was given to me by you?\" It was one moonlit night when I was looking after that person, I by chance saw a woman dressed entirely in pitch black, holding in her arms a moon orb. Under the stark white moon light, her body was veiled with silvery white brightness, giving off a feeling of uncertainty. Even I couldn't help but feel suspicious about whether monsters and ghosts truly exist in the world. This was inconceivable to me. It wasn't her attire, rarely seen in this country; what I noticed was how she would often look at the attic. Not moving closer, not showing hostility, only ever gazing with yearning eyes. Why did she have such an expression? I couldn't get an answer from her. But I found out very quickly that it wasn't a question worth reflecting on. Because I'd never wait around meaninglessly like her. I would think up every idea to take them back, even if meant destroying this world that took them away in the first place... A red butterfly suddenly appeared, snapping me out of my thoughts. Its wings, as red as fresh blood, looked abnormally beautiful under the moonlight; it's just that the unusually shaped butterfly wings perturbed me. However, there've always existed unknown things in this world, and it's also the only way for me to get any sort of amusement. I returned to the room with that in mind, and discovered that Pizza was trying to hide the slight movements he made upon waking up. I pretended to lift up Pizza's jaw, the panicking Food Soul didn't even realize his own closed eyelids never ceased trembling. Such terrible acting skills, it even made me lose the will to continue my act along with Pizza. \"You've awakened?\" As expected, after I spoke those words, Pizza finally opened his eyes to look at me. Those eyes full of fury, they proved that the experiment had failed. But that's alright, there's already no way to change this country's fate. It was as I pondered on how I was going to deal with this meaningless \"trash\", that Cassata, an uncertainty in my plans, appeared. But I suppose this was also in accordance to my expectations, though? Ants have always been fond of huddling together for warmth, talking self-righteously about things that they could clearly not change. Although I didn't have time to listen to the two before me exchange quotes on friendship, such a rude intrusion would make even someone like me angry. Perhaps because of the retaliation from earlier, perhaps because I wanted that pair of turquoise eyes to reveal hate, I graciously told them of the script I'd planned. As expected, Pizza's reaction was as I predicted. However, I didn't think the final chapter of this play would unexpectedly give me this sort of \"pleasant surprise\". Black flames entwined the flag that Pizza was gripping tightly onto, that symbol of peace. The flame corroded flag became a giant black scythe and came swinging towards me, just like that. Dragging around such a wrecked body, yet still trying so hard, thinking he could kill me? Truly a cute child. \"You're quite the interesting 'trash'~\" At that time, I gave up on my initial idea of disposing this 'trash'. I leaped back, easily avoiding Pizza's attack. \"Though I've already reached my goal, you really surprised me, Pizza~\" Perhaps this time, the experiment wasn't pointless. Pizza's change was no doubt the work of alchemy. But the cycle of life is certainly not as simple as I think. Relying on only theories isn't enough, I'd need to conduct more experiments, be it on humans or Food Souls, as long as I can meet that person again... I won't hesitate to give my all, even if I become the world's enemy. On a certain year, at a restaurant somewhere in Hilena, Gloriville. After going through an endlessly long deep sleep, I opened my eyes once again. Bright sunlight seeped through the restaurant window, this time, projecting the peerlessly unfamiliar world before my eyes. Who will I encounter? I pondered about that as I looked around my surroundings. I saw a face that seemed familiar, and standing besides them was that woman dressed in pitch black, her arms holding onto a bright moon. At that moment, the corner of my lips lifted into a smile. \"Master Attendant, in this world, there exists a rule of maintaining balance. A wish fulfilled means a sacrifice has been simultaneously made... Then, what did you lose from meeting me just now?\" That familiar smile bloomed on their face once again. \"I would still lose something for summoning you? Hum... I think... Aside from money, everything else is open for discussion, hey!\" Aside from money? Though I didn't expect that reply, I was finally able to meet that person once again. Heh, I never wanted that, I only ever wanted your freedom. Which is why this time, I will certainly not let you go again. V. Whisky It's unknown if anyone is aware, but all beginnings of a story are just there for endings that've been long written down. Legend has it that there exists a sort of unnamed, fire-breathing monster; it had the head of a lion, the body of a mountain goat, and the tail of a python. No matter where the monster appears, it will always destroy that place, which is why wherever it goes becomes a wasteland. Perhaps because the rumor was too scary, very soon the legend of that fierce beast was adapted into a fairy tale. This fairy tale would always include a kind-hearted and honest prince, along with a righteous knight. They would then go and slay that monster, ushering peace into the world at the end. People would live a happy and blessed life in a fairy tale ending. But it was all just a lie, nevertheless. This kingdom used to be a peaceful one. The king was diligent and he loved his citizens, he had a virtuous and beautiful queen, and a cute princess as the heir to his throne. However, this kingdom held a secret. That secret was, the princess heiress was actually a twin child. They were like geminated flowers*; the world's most beautiful, most pristine, but also, most sorrowful flowers. Translator's Note: Twin flowers- based on a Chinese legend. It's said there were two flowers that bloomed next to each other at the same time, they loved each other but would also constantly fight non stop. The two flowers would use the most profound way of hurting to express their deepest love until death. In the end, they became willing to kill the other, because when one of them dies, the other would follow suit. They were born together, with their faces looking almost the same. But their personalities were the complete opposite of each other. The elder sister was cheerful and intelligent, good at socializing; she was someone who anyone would think of as a suitable heir to the throne. The younger sister was gloomy and introverted, never one to go outside, to a point where nobody knew of her existence. Perhaps it was really because of their polar opposite personalities that even though they bore the same face, they were still tormented differently. From the very beginning, it was clear that their different fates were determined from the moment of birth. Whisky's Master Attendant was a famous doctor who hailed from this kingdom, and his responsibility was to look after the country's royal heir. He's also the only person who knew about the secret. The younger twin sister, who had genetic chimerism, possessed a weak body, ridden with many illnesses since her birth. For that reason, the elder twin sister was the real successor to the country's throne. But medical science at that time couldn't explain why the younger sister's body had this strange birthmark. It was as if angels and demons had combined in one deformed body, that ferocious beast of legend, also a product of chimerism, came to the minds of the king and queen. Since they could recall this, it wasn't hard to guarantee that others would think the same. Once someone discovers this, it might be difficult for the young child to escape death. So to protect their daughter, and at the same time, prevent the kingdom from falling into chaos, the king hid away the existence of the twin child. In order to cure the strange birthmark on his daughter's body, the king appointed Whisky's Master Attendant to treat his daughter's \"strange illness,\" in that small attic no one was allowed to enter. Meanwhile, the elder twin sister lived a lavish life ever since childhood, receiving high education, and learning dignified etiquette. She was praised and expected to rule by millions. At first, the dearly beloved and respected princess didn't know she had a little sister. But after she found out, she would frequently sneak into the attic to visit her little sister. She would often talk to her sister, telling her stories; she wanted to give all the best to this pitiful little sister of hers. But taking pity is an attitude from only those of higher status; in the eyes of the lowly, charity is the lowest form of goodwill. The elder sister's tenderness was not understood by her little sister; it was even taken advantage of, breeding darker malevolence within her younger sister's heart. Then, one day, the king and queen suddenly passed away. The once modest and courteous heiress became an arrogant and domineering queen. At that time, the queen would always have this middle aged man, whom she referred to as 'doctor,' by her side. That man was Whisky's Master Attendant. Everyone believed that it was only because the terrible girl, who had hid her true nature since childhood, committed fratricide that she was able to gain her position. But Whisky knew his Master Attendant could not shake off his involvement in all of this. Under his Master Attendant's arrangements, Whisky became responsible for taking care of the girl, who quite resembled the queen. However, instead of 'looking after', it'd be better to call it 'guarding'. Everyday, Whisky's task was to make her take medicine that weakened her body But even in this sort of environment, she bore no resentment. Her unconditional trust in her sister and her excessive optimism, while being in a situation no different from house arrest, Whisky found it all ridiculous. But at the same time, she also received new redemption. \"Don't you get sick of constantly reading this made up story?\" \"Hmm, it's because this is the kind of world I want to see.\" \"Even if it's all a lie in the end?\" \"......\" \"Then what if I also lie to you?\" \"If lying can bring someone happiness, then it will turn into a fairy tale.\" She told Whisky with a smile. That person accepted all forms of malice, and even Whisky, who was full of lies, became glorified into a fairy tale by this young girl. Besides them, no one else knew that inside the attic of the high tower was a girl, whose leg was cuffed with chains, silently reading that fairytale storybook she used to read to her younger sister countless times before. When the clock chimes four times, it's time for the queen of this kingdom to enjoy her afternoon tea. That palace was filled with fragrant flowers. In the garden, surrounded by butterflies, the queen would spend this time indulging in the most expensive food and black tea, and using the most exquisite silverware and furniture. Such a beautiful picture, even the butterflies that stopped by on the garden's flowers looked like savage monsters. Ever since then, the name \"Bloodthirsty Butterfly\" spread around the kingdom, just like that. Very soon, the tyrannical monarch's debauchery inadvertently drew catastrophe. The kingdom's happy laughter and cheerful voices were all trampled over, the cost of the people's hunger and poverty. The masses, suffering from disaster, eventually chose the path of revolt. Whisky's Master Attendant came to realize all of this, and proceeded to take all of the easily transportable valuables with him. Then, he ordered Whisky to help him escape the kingdom that very night. It wasn't long after their horse carriage left that the kingdom was quickly breached by its people. Whisky watched the ending to this story, which he had long come to understand. Yet, all the while, he expected a miracle to appear. It was probably because he's heard the same fairytale too many times, over and over again. It was the first time he had even the slightest shred of hope in God's mercy. But God still betrayed him. Once Whisky was done settling with his Master Attendant, he went back to the kingdom. Was it because he wanted to save that girl, who probably hasn't been discovered by the furious mob? Was that why he went back to that aerial 'cage'? He constantly asked himself why he went back. But before he could get his answer, he was met with an ice cold corpse, pierced by a long sword, lying on the ground. The fresh blood's crimson reflected his scarlet eyes. Only the smile on the girl's face proved that she was alive only moments before. Whisky once asked her a question regarding life and death. For Food Souls, be it life or death, neither are truly important. He used to always believe that. But after meeting her, Whisky suddenly wanted to know her answer. She said she'd never thought of dying, nor had she ever feared death. Death is not meaningless, it's an ending but also a beginning. And so, death also has its worth. Does this kind of death have any worth? Looking at the faint smile, lingering on that person's face, he couldn't oppose it, as this was her decision. But why did it have to be her who died? Aside from her life, the world has never given her anything else. The most laughable thing was how she genuinely wanted to protect this country, but instead, became the condemned tyrant who ended up dead. What is the truth? Is the truth really that important? People only know how to take out their accumulated anger on what they think is truth, to the point where they can't even tell who the real tormentor is. There was not a trace of cloud in the night sky, as if warning this fairytale's happy ending. On the barren land, the clock chimed once more, the sounds akin to the devil's call. But that evening, the tea drinking queen has already perished. The people laughed happily, rolling out red carpets and sprinkling fresh flowers, awaiting a beautiful future. It won't be long until they forgot all of this, and then started their lives anew. However, Whisky could not comprehend this fairytale ending made from lies. He wants to tarnish it all, he wants to destroy this peace guarded by the people. Because this was what took her away. He never quite understood how it only takes a contract to have himself bound. Food Souls are clearly more powerful than humans, but why are they subjected to unconditional obedience under a contract? From the very beginning, he had nothing. Important Master Attendant? The person who should be protected? Aren't these imposed on them by these so-called contracts? Then why did he say those things? Why did he show people those kinds of expressions? Because they liked it, isn't that right? To them, it didn't matter whether Whisky's actions were real or fake. But then, who is he? Is the Whisky in the eyes of others the real him? For the longest time, Whisky was never able to understand this contradictory world. It's full of liars, so why should he be honest? However, after meeting that person, Whisky began to understand what he's been searching for all along. It took him all of his efforts, and he thought he'd already found it. But she was taken away. Which is why, this so-called peace and those humans that scapegoated her will all be destroyed by him. He will take all that she endured and return it to those who hurt her a million times over. Until he's created a future where he can see her again...... Until he can find himself in that pair of eyes again......

Funeral Overture Under the cloudless and vast sky was the infertile land. The voices of the people were also accompanied by the sudden toiling of bells. Although their life wasn't great, there were smiles on the people faces which was incompatible with the scene. Although it was winter, the flowers filled the streets during such an unsuitable season. Although the snow piles have yet to be cleared, the red carpet has already been impatiently rolled out. A traveler came to this village by chance and witnessed this joyous scene in front of him. He began to ask. \"What kind of grand celebration is this? Is today a special occasion?\" A traveler did not expect a reply. At the same time in this quiet street, a shadow grew behind the traveler. Behind his red eyes was an inconspicuous and icy smile. \"No, this is a funeral. A funeral to bury this country's past.'' \"Eh? A.......funeral.......?\" The sound of the toiled bell continues to reverberate in the air. The traveler turned his head to get more answer from that man, but he simply vanished. After thousands of years, it became a peaceful country full of daisies. There weren't any wars or bullying. Everything was so peaceful and beautiful, like those in fairytales. \"If lies can bring happiness, it can also create a fairytale.\" I could still recall how that person smiled and said this as he gazed at the sky. Now that the unfulfilled wish in the past has become a reality, will he be happy? Heh. Even if this was a lie, people would still believe it. Seeing how much that desolated village changed, I laughed. The present king was different from his predecessor. He was a human who loved peace. The king's benevolence and hardworking attitude earned the love of his people. Even his Food Souls were said to become a symbol of peace. Despite this, he couldn't solve everything. It was the sickness that plagues the princess, Elias. The princess was weak and sick since childhood, so notices of recruiting people who could heal were posted throughout the country. I quietly looked at the word on the kraft paper that had long been blurred due to weathering. The mottled traces on the paper tell me that no one has dared to uncover the facts of this notice for a long time. However, for me, this is an invitation to begin this prelude. I was quickly taken to the palace by the guards when I answered the notice. The simple and elegant palace has only the empty walls of the complex patterns, and the luxurious decorations in my impression have disappeared completely. Even the man sitting on the throne looks so amiable. Peace in this country exists, and I am convinced of this. At the same time, I hate this too. But no matter what kind of country, there will be locusts foraging, and I am best at discovering such humans. \"What can you do to cure our princess?\" It was a man who was laughing next to the king and deliberately considered me. Actually, he didn't care who I was, because he didn't believe I could cure the princess. But it is such a hypocritical human being that will become my best chess piece. \"I wonder if your Majesty has ever heard of alchemy?\" I saluted the king politely and said. \"Alchemy?! You are...?!!!\" \"My name is Vita. Although I am a traveler, I just happened to get something interesting when I was traveling. I believe I can help you cure the Princess.\" \"Hey! How many people do you think you have promised here?!'' The hypocritical man seemed to feel my indifference to him, and the tone was more impatient than before. I still didn't answer his question and opened the box in my hand. \"This, is this...?\" Looking at the golden double snakes twining in my hands, the surprise in their eyes is self-evident, and soon it becomes a kind of joy. \"Was this created by alchemy?\" \"In short, it is to use alchemy to create such a substance.\" As I thought, they believed in my statement. \"But it will take some time to prepare... \" II. Godless Talks Human beings are a very interesting thing. If Food Souls themselves are the power of dreams, then human beings are the pure aggregation of desires, pure to the existence that they want to devour except themselves. After gaining their trust, the former hypocritical man soon made a difference to me. After I offered the preparation time, the kind king readily agreed to my request. At the same time, the man took the initiative to invite the king to entertain me during this period. It was then that I learned that he was the king's brother, Prince Carl. \"Mr. Vita is obviously a businessman. I didn't expect him to understand medical treatment.\" \"Just a little bit.\" \"Where did you do such a job before?\" \"Medicine or alchemy is all about giving yourself more bargaining chips.\" \"Transaction?\" \"Well, have you forgotten? I am a businessman. So, what is the most worthwhile thing to trade with?\" I tapped my finger gently on the side of my head in order to make his rotten head useful for thinking. \"Money? Treasure? Or power?\" \"Ha-ha... It's life. Nobody can escape death, can they?\" I looked at this human being with desire in his eyes, and I lowered my voice slightly. Sure enough, I got his attention, his expression solidified in an instant, and then I turned my head carelessly. \"However, even in this case, the value of life varies from person to person.\" \"That is nature. People are inherently valuable. That's why I'm here. It's also the proof that I'll be king in the future.\" \"You're right, everything is fate......\" Apparently he was satisfied with my answer as he wished, approaching me without any precautions, smirking. \"So, Mr. Vita, are you willing to make a deal with me?\" \"Of course, I am a businessman.\" The smile is unconsciously floating on the lips, so I don't believe in fate or believe in God. In this country surrounded by daisies, even the palace is full of pure white flowers. Therefore, the blue shadow will be so conspicuous when it flashes past my eyes. \"Oh, don't embarrass me. It's a gift from a neighboring country received by His Majesty the King. It can't be broken!\" \"I just want to show Her Royal Highness, and I'll bring it back in a minute! Don't worry!!!\" The blonde teenager was chased by a young man who looked like a servant, and the hearty laughter broke through the peace and quietness of the palace. \"It's Pizza again. I don't know what the King was thinking, letting that food soul run around in the palace all day long.'' ''The food soul?'' \"What's wrong, Mr. Vita?\" Looking at the innocent smile on his face, I suddenly thought of something interesting. \"So...it's him...'' Human beings are good at betrayal. I have reminded that person many times about this kind of thing. \"Why do you think you are here now?\" \"Isn't it good to live like this? I used to be busy studying, thinking that I must let myself handle political affairs as soon as possible, so that I can help my elderly father as soon as possible, and I can protect my sister.\" \"She has now become king in your stead.'' \"Well, perhaps I owe her, because she did not have a healthy body nor the proper love.'' \"Owe her? Both of you were born together, even your looks are so similar, how could she hate you?\" I said with a smile, as the bowl of poison in my hand ate away that man's body. This is what my Master Attendant gave me. I know that this medicine is not enough to kill, but it can make people increasingly weaker. \"Do you say that people in this country are living happily now?\" Closing the storybook has been seen countless times, the man took it without hesitation and drank the medicine, but suddenly asked me such questions inexplicably. \"If I said yes?\" \"I will believe it.\" \"Oh, do you not really think so?\" \"I can't possibly know the answer, can I? So I choose to believe in you standing in front of my eyes.'' The man looked at the sky and then turned to me, reflecting the sunlight in the sky, which was too dazzling for me, who had been in the dark. Believe... It's really a funny joke. \"So you can cut off the contract and control the Food Soul at the same time? \" \"If I said yes?\" Same words, but this time, it is no longer the man's small tower attic, but the residence of Prince Carl. \"That's naturally worth a try.\" He quickly took the black dagger in my hand, staring straight at it, never moving away. So, is it me or is it this dagger that he believes in? In fact, this is just an experiment, even I can't guarantee that it will be achieved. But things that cannot distinguish between true and false have the value of being a lie. Interestingly, as long as it is what humans want, no matter how unrealistic they are willing to believe. Soon, the man summoned a Food Soul named Cassata and placed it next to the king as planned. III. Endless Nights The waiting time is meaningless to most people, but for the king, it is enough to consume the mind. People's emotions are often blind, just like diseases. So, when I appeared again, the king's eyes were much deeper than when I first saw it. \"Mr. Vita is a traveler. Because he has traveled through many countries, he has learned some mysterious techniques that are unknown. It is gratifying that one of them can cure the princess.\" ''It was God who cared for the princess that made me meet her.\" I approached the palace again, but I didn't expect to meet him so soon. \"His Majesty, this is?\" \"My food soul, his name is Pizza.\" It seems that the king really favored Pizza, and his love for him was described in a fatherly voice. However, Pizza looked at me with some vigilance... or...was it more appropriate to use fear? In this way, the weak animals occasionally have some unexpected and useful intuitions. \"His flag... It is gorgeous...\" The bright smile that made people want to tear up just now had disappeared from his face. It's so good~ He can look at me with such skeptical eyes, it's a happy expression. As pure as that person's eyes, I can even see myself in the green pupil like the lake. I hate things that are too pure, and that kind of existence only makes me want to be more dirty. The eyes looked away as soon as they looked at me. \"Ah...th-thank you.\" He clutched the flag in his hand as if it would give him a little sense of security. I don't laugh. This is really the character that will appear in the story that the person likes. Later, the king arranged a place for me in the palace, and Pizza often came here to take medicine. Although it is interesting to watch his distorted expression because of fear, I am not going to expose myself too early. As the days passed, Pizza began to wait only at the door, which gradually became an occasional walk around the room. \"Mr. Vita, you look so young, do you feel like you know a lot?\" \"Is it? Probably because of my time, I stopped a long time ago.\" The moment the person left, he stopped. \"Stop?\" \"How is the princess doing as of late?\" I opened the conversation. Of course, I never expected him to understand such words. \"It's better than before. Speaking of which, Mr. Vita, are you a doctor?\" \"Doctor?\" That is really a \"noble\" title. Unfortunately, I don't like it. \"I am just an ordinary businessman.\" Now I'm just here for my own personal desire. After that man left, I read all the medical books left by Master Attendant, but there was no way to see that person again. So, I took advantage of everything around me. After many years of searching, I discovered this alchemy that was gradually forgotten by human beings. According to the book, the first step in alchemy is to \"eliminate the characteristics\", restore the metal back to pure sulfur and mercury, and then tap the potential of the metal to re-integrate it to get a new metal. The life of this world is composed of the power of dreams, and Food Souls is the material of the \"seed\" that is closest to the power of dreams. Of course, I also told the king the gratifying news. \"No... Is there any other way?'' The king who heard the news, sitting on the chair in the study, asked in a very pleading tone. \"Pizza...Like Elias, he is also a child I love.\" \"I am also very sad, Your Majesty, but I think this is the best way now.\" I whispered in the ear of the king. Just let him use a food soul to shake into such a weak human, if he knew that after the success of this experiment, his food soul would kill his own people and destroy his country, what kind of interesting expression would it show? \"When the princess dies, you can't see her again. But food souls are different. They can be summoned again even if they dissipate...Don't you think that's a good proposal?\" \"Pizza...Pizza...\" The description of the withered king just kept repeating the name of Pizza, and the tears flowed around his dull eyes. In addition to being responsible for the princess's daily medicines, I was \"lucky\" to start working on the king's diet. Weakness will destroy his remaining reason and useless love. The more he struggles, the more he suffers. The fall of the soul is more raging than the death of the flesh. \"So, your Majesty, what do you think?\" A thunderous thunder broke through the sky, and the king's face was lightened by the flash of light. \"...Please, Mr. Vita.\" Humans will only follow their most primitive desires. And in that moment meant that his soul was dead. \"My pleasure, Your Majesty.\" The thunder of the outside roared, and the lightning that broke the air could not stop the erosion of the darkness. I was hiding there, waiting for the only shimmer to be swallowed up in this endless night. IV. Meeting You Although I experienced the expected episode, I managed to take Pizza away. When I left the palace and came to my former residence, Prince Carl seemed unable to resist the temptation to call up his own rebels. The actors and scripts are all ready, and I know what's going to happen on this stage. However, all this has nothing to do with me. The hypocritical peace has disappeared, and now I just want to see that person again. Time passes by. How long has it been since I looked around in the darkness? I kept trying to destroy his will in various ways and tactics, but I could not find the right core. Looking at Pizza who was lying on the icy stone platform, even sleeping made him look like he was smiling. Unprovoked irritability will only gradually deepen my dislike. It seems that only by constantly cutting his body with a knife can I see his expression distorted by pain. Ah... It's really an unpleasant feeling. Waiting for the results of the experiment seemed to take longer than I expected, so I went out to the corridor. By this time, the dark clouds had disappeared, leaving only the lonely moonlight. Looking at the castle near the palace, there is no church tower with ancient bells, nor the cage-like pavilion, but the past is easy to see. \"Did I bring you this unfortunate fate?\" On a certain moonlit night of taking care of that person, I stumbled upon the woman with a black-handed hand holding moon beads. Under the pale moonlight, her body was covered with silvery moonlight, and there was a bit more unreal feeling. Even I can't help but wonder if the world really has ghosts. This makes me feel a little incredible. Not only is she wearing the rare costume of this country, but what matters to me is that she often looks at the attic, not close, not hostile, but with a nostalgic look. Why is there such an expression? I didn't get an answer from her mouth. But soon I discovered that this is not a question worth considering. Because I would never do such meaningless waiting as she did. I will do everything I can to get it back, even if it will destroy the world that took that person away... I don't know when the sudden appearance of the red butterfly interrupted my thoughts. The blood-like wings are very beautiful in the moonlight night, but the special shape of butterfly wings made me care a little. However, there is always something unknown in this world, and this is the only way I can have fun. Thinking about it, I went back to my room and found Pizza covering up the slight movements that he was awake. I pretended to lift his jaw, and he was nervous enough to not notice the constant trembling of his closed eyelids. Really bad acting skills, unwilling to even let me accompany him to play. \"Are you awake?\" Sure enough, after finishing this sentence, he finally opened his eyes and looked at me. The angry eyes proved the failure of the experiment. But it doesn't matter, the outcome of this country can't be changed. Just as I was thinking about how to deal with this \"waste\" that was meaningless, the uncertainty factor in my plan, Cassata, appeared. However, can it be said that this is also my expectation? The ants always like to hug the group to warm themselves, and they are self-righteous to say something that they obviously cannot change. Although I don't have time to listen to their friendship in front of me, even I would be angry with such a rude way of breaking in. Perhaps it was in retaliation for what I had just done, or in order to see the eyes of the turquoise green again showing hatred, I kindly told them the truth about my planned play. Sure enough, Pizza made the same reaction as I expected. I just didn't think that the final chapter of this script would unexpectedly give me such a \"surprise.\" The black flame entangled the flag that symbolizes peace that he once held, and the flag eroded by the flames turned into a huge black sickle so greeted me. Are you still trying so hard to kill me with such a crippled body? What a lovely child. \"You really are an interesting failure. Ah~\" At this time, I dismissed the idea that I wanted to dispose of this \"waste\". I jumped back and easily escaped Pizza's attack. \"Although my purpose has been achieved, you can really surprise me, Pizza~\" This experiment may not be meaningless. There is no doubt that the change of Pizza is caused by alchemy. But the transformation of life is not as simple as I thought. It is not enough to rely on theory. I still need more experiments. Whether it is human beings or food souls, as long as I can see that person again... Even if I am against the world, I will spare no effort. In a certain year, somewhere in the village of Hilena. After a long sleep, I opened my eyes again. The bright sunshine came in through the window of the restaurant, and the world projected in my eyes has become unfamiliar. Who will you meet? I looked around and saw the woman standing beside the familiar face with the bright moon in her hand. At that moment, my mouth raised a smile. ''Master Attendant, are you familiar with equivalent exchange? In this world, there exist a law that maintains balance. A wish that has been fulfilled may also signifies a sacrifice...Therefore, what did you lose the moment you met me? The familiar smile once again bloomed on that face. \"Is there a loss to summon you?... I think... except for money, everything is good to discuss!\" Except for money? Although it was an answer I hadn't thought of, I finally met the man again. ...That's never what I want. I just want your freedom. So this time, I will never let you go again. V. Whisky It's unknown if anyone knows. The beginning of all the stories is just for the already finished ending. Legend has it that there is a nameless monster that can spurt fire, it has the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a python. No matter where it appears, it will destroy that place, so it will be desolate wherever it goes. Perhaps it is because the rumors are too terrible, and soon the legend of the beast is adapted into a fairy tale. In the fairy tale there will be a good prince and a knight of justice to kill the monster, and finally the world will usher in peace. People will live a happy life at the end of the fairy tale. But all that is a lie after all. It used to be a peaceful kingdom, the king was diligent and loved the people, the queen was good and beautiful, and the lovely princess as the Crown princess. However, this kingdom has a secret. That is, the Crown princess is actually a twin. They are like twins, the most beautiful, pure and saddest flower in the world. They were born together, with almost the same face, but two opposite personalities. The sister is bright and intelligent, and she is good at communication. She is a candidate who seems to be suitable as a Crown Princess. Her sister is gloomy and autistic, she does not leave her home, and she is not even known. Perhaps it is precisely because of their opposite personality that they suffer different torments even though they share the same fate. It should have been known for a long time that from the moment they were born, they decided their different futures. The Master Attendant of Whisky is the famous medical scientist in this country, responsible for taking care the king's daughters. Only he knows the secrets of twins. Because the twin sister who was a chimera at birth was weak and sick, and the other twin sister is the real queen of the country. But doctors at that time could not explain the strange birthmarks left on her sister. Like the ugly body of angels and demons, the king and queen remembered the legendary beast that was also chiseled. Since they can think of it, it is not difficult to guarantee that no one else will think of it. Once discovered, this young child may not be able to escape. In order to protect their children while not letting the kingdom into chaos, the king hid the existence of the twins. In order to heal the strange birthmarks of his daughter, the king appointed Whisky's Master Attendant to heal his daughter's \"strange disease\" in a little attic that no one could enter. The twin's sister, from a young age, had a high education, learned decent etiquette, and received praise and expectations from all walks of life. At first, the princess, who was praised by many stars, didn't know that she had a sister. But after she knew about it, she often went to the attic to visit her sister. She often talks to her sister and tells stories. She wanted to give the best to her poor sister. But poor people are the gestures that high-ranking people have. In the eyes of the low-ranking people, charity is the least goodwill. Her gentleness failed to be understood by her sister, and was even taken advantage of, so that her sister's heart breeds a deeper malice. Then one day, the king and the queen suddenly died. The modest and courteous Crown princess turned into a proud and domineering queen. At the time of the Queen, there was always a middle-aged man she called a \"doctor.\" That person is the Master Attendant of Whisky. Everyone thought that it was this terrible girl who hid her nature from childhood that got her present position. But Whisky knows that all of this had something to do with his Master Attendant. According to the arrangement of Master Attendant, he is responsible for taking care of a girl who is very similar to the current queen. But that's more about surveillance than care. It is the task of Whisky to let her take the drugs that cause debilitation every day. But even in such an environment, she has no resentment against it. The unconditional trust in her sister and her over-optimism about her situation and the situation of being under house arrest made the Whisky feel ridiculous while also getting a new redemption. \"You have been reading this fictional story, don't you feel tired?\" \"Well, because this is the world I want to see.\" \"Even if that's a lie in the end?\" \"...\" \"What if I lied to you, too?\" \"If a lie can make people happy, it will become a fairy tale.\" She said to Whisky with a smile. The man accepted all the malice, and even the man full of lies was praised as a fairy tale by the girl. Except for them, no one knows that in the tower of the kingdom, the girl with the chain on her foot quietly looked at the fairy tale that she had read countless times for her sister. When the clock rings four times, it is the time for the queen of the kingdom to enjoy afternoon tea. In the garden where the palace is full of flowers and butterflies, the Queen enjoys the most expensive food and black tea, using the most sophisticated tableware, tables and chairs to spend the time. Such a beautiful picture, even the butterfly resting on the flower of the garden, looks like a monster drinking blood. Since then, the name \"bloodthirsty butterfly\" had spread throughout the kingdom. Soon, the tyranny of the monarch brought disaster. The joys and laughter of the kingdom were all trampling on the hunger and poverty of the common people. The people who have suffered from the disaster had finally embarked on the journey of resistance. The Master Attendant, who was aware of all this, took away all the easy-to-carry valuables and ordered Whisky to help him escape the kingdom overnight. Shortly after their carriage left, the kingdom was quickly broken into by the people. Whisky watched the end of the story he had already understood, but looked forward to miracles. Probably because he had heard the same fairy tales too many times, he had for the first time, a glimmer of expectation for God's mercy. However, God still betrayed him. Whisky settled down and returned to the kingdom. Maybe because he wanted to save the girl who might not have been found by angry people, so he came to the \"cage\" in the air. He constantly questioned why he went back. However, before he could get the answer, he saw the icy body that was pierced by a long sword and lay on the ground. The bright red blood reflected his scarlet eyes. Only the smile on the girl's face proved that she ever had a temperature. Whiskey had asked her questions about life and death. For food souls, neither life nor death is really important. He always thought so before. However, after meeting her, Whisky suddenly wanted to know her answer. She said she never wanted to die in the past, but she never feared death. Death is not meaningless, it is the end, it will be the beginning, then death is valuable. Is such death valuable? Looking at the faint smile left on the man's face, he could not deny that it was the choice that the man made. But why did she die? The world had given her nothing but life. And the most ridiculous thing is that she died like a tyrant when she wanted to protect the country. What is the truth? Is the truth really important? People just vent their accumulated anger on what they think is the truth, even those who really persecute themselves can't tell. There is no hazy sky, as if to herald the happy ending of this fairy tale. On the barren land, the bell sounded like a devil's call again. But the queen who was drinking afternoon tea had disappeared. People smiled happily, laid a red carpet, sprinkled flowers, and looked forward to a bright future. Soon, people will forget about it and start a new life. But Whisky couldn't understand the fairy tale ending made up of lies. He wanted to destroy it all, he wanted to destroy the peace that this person guards. Because it is all this that took her away. He has always wondered why a contract can bind him. Why are food souls more noble than human beings but subject to unconditional obedience due to the contract? From the beginning, he had nothing. Master Attendant? The person to protect? Aren't these things imposed on them by this so-called contract? Then why do you say those words yourself? Why do you want to show that kind of expression to those people? Because they like it, don't they? For them, it doesn't matter whether everything they do is true or not. So who is he? Is it really you who you see in the eyes of those people? Whisky had long been unable to understand this paradoxical world. The world is full of deception, so why should he be sincere? But after meeting that person, Whisky began to understand what he had always wanted to find. It was not easy. He thought he could find it. But she was taken away. Therefore, this so-called peace and the human being who used her as a scapegoat will all be destroyed. He wanted to return everything that the person had endured to the thousands of people who have hurt her. Until he creates a future where he can see her again...
