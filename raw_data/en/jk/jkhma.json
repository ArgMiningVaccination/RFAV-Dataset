At the age of twenty-one, I developed several health issues that would not respond well to conventional treatment. I then decided to turn to natural medicine. I began to read books on nutrition, detoxification, and herbal medicine. Within six months of implementing what I was learning, I had a turnaround in health for the better. Today, I am in my sixties, in good health and I am not on any prescription medications. The same help is available for you too.

At the age of 35 I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. For the next 10 years I took my thyroid medication faithfully and yet I never felt any better. Nothing really improved. I never had enough energy, I struggled to lose weight, I had a tendency toward depression; to put it mildly I was extremely frustrated. I'd go to my doctor and tell him about my fatigue, my depression and my inability to lose weight. He'd tell me my labs looked fine; it wasn't my thyroid.
