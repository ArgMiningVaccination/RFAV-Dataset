This is the third authorisation procedure submitted in Switzerland for a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. \"The rolling submission procedure for mRNA-1273 is based on the initially submitted data packages on the preclinical situation and quality, as well as on preliminary clinical data. In a rolling review, the data can be evaluated as soon as they become available. The companies can then submit the latest data continuously without having to wait for the conclusive results from all studies,\" [Swissmedic said on FridayExternal link](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81112.html).

This accelerates the review process while at the same time \"preserving the same level of careful checking of all requirements relating to safety, efficacy and quality\", it explained. The agency is already reviewing authorisation applications for Covid-19 vaccines from the companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech.

It is also in negotiations with Pfizer/BioNTech about assuring delivery. Swissmedic has to examine and approve any product before it is distributed.

Coronavirus infections in Switzerland rose by 6,739, the federal health authorities said on Friday. The death toll increased by 97. In compliance with the JTI standards More: [SWI swissinfo.ch "}
