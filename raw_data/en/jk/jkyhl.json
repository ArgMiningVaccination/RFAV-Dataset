You explore the immense castle until you stumble upon the private chambers of the king and discover a large cupboard. You've found King David's medicine cabinet! You swing open the heavy wooden doors, locate a treasure trove of healing balms, oils, spices and herbs inside, and you decide to take a closer look. First, you find the woodsy and sweet-smelling sandalwood, which the king may use to clean wounds or as a natural aphrodisiac. Then you find some minty tasting hyssop that King David likely uses to soothe his aching muscles after battle and which acts as a powerful antiseptic. You smell the distinctive aroma of clean, energizing cypress, known for its ability to heal wounds and infections and serve as a powerful deodorant to keep the king smelling fresh in between his royal baths. You find smoky, bittersweet, sticky myrrh that the king and his royal family use to fight aging and help prevent gum disease. Then you pick up a vial of warm, spicy cassia, which boosts the body's immune system as it acts as a natural insect repellant to keep the king from being harassed by bugs during the hot Jerusalem summers. And finally, you find highly cherished and prized frankincense that King David uses in his and his wives' soaps and perfumes to hydrate and protect their bodies. Healing with Biblical Medicine All of these oils and more are what the queens and kings of ancient days used as their medicine. There were no pharmacies on every corner; instead, there were simply herbs, spices and other plant parts known to promote health and healing. Fast forward to today and step into our own personal homes. Inside, we invite you to look into our medicine cabinets. What you won't find is a single prescription medication. Instead, you will discover a cornucopia of ancient medicines and natural remedies based in nature, including herbs, INTRODUCTION11 spices, supplements and dozens of essential oils. Inside Dr. Josh's home, you'll always find frankincense; Jordan is never far away from a bottle of lavender; and Ty's office is drenched in the aromas of orange and peppermint. We use essential oils in extensive ways in our lives; they wear many hats, if you will\u2014as our medicines, our cleansing agents, our personal care products and countless other uses. Why do we rely on essential oils exactly, and why do we believe that everyone else should, too? The reasons are simple: Instead of simply depending on prescription medications and synthetic drugs with a list of dangerous side effects, our families have opted for safer, natural remedies with thousands of years of history proving their benefits. Instead of using common household cleaners and personal care products that contain ingredients that cause toxicity, we have chosen superior alternatives that can achieve the same (or even better) results without the risk of damaging our bodies. In the quest for health and vibrant living, the three of us have collaborated multiple times over the last several years in order to share important messages of health and hope. During this time, we have discovered that we all believe essential oils are one of the most powerful forms of plant-based medicine in the world. Now, we want to show you how essential oils can transform the health of your entire family. Essential oils can serve innumerable functions in your life\u2014from fostering relaxation and caring for scrapes to helping fight disease and promoting healing. Essential oils were placed on this Earth to benefit our health and provide rejuvenation. In fact, they have been a vital part of our individual journeys, both personally and in the pursuit of helping others find abundant health. Allow us to share the roles essential oils play in our personal lives in order to equip and empower you to use them every day.We have seen essential oils benefit our families and our patients in some of the following ways: Reduce toxicity Balance hormonesImprove digestionBoost energyImprove brain functionReduce emotional stress Produce radiant skinBoost immunity and fight infectionsAlleviate aches and pains And, a whole lot more! \u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb \u00bb 11 I was 14 when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and my family was blindsided by the diagnosis. The doctors recommended an aggressive chemotherapy treatment, and Mom consented to go this traditional route\u2014which included a mastectomy\u2014to eradicate the disease. I will never forget how sick my mom was from the chemo. I recall seeing her hair fall out in clumps and thinking she had aged 20 years in two weeks and praying for God to spare her life. After her treatments, she was pronounced cancer-free, but she became sicker than ever. She struggled with leaky gut syndrome, hypothyroidism, weight gain, chronic constipation, candida yeast infections and depression, and she was on multiple medications and felt tired all the time. Ten years later, my mom was diagnosed with cancer yet again. I remember the phone call well. \"Josh, I've got bad news. My cancer has recurred. What do I do?\" I immediately flew home; our family prayed together, and ultimately, we felt the Lord was leading us to take care of my mom naturally. At this time, I had been training to become a doctor of natural medicine and a chiropractic physician and knew some of the top holistic doctors in the world. I started spending at least 12 hours each day researching natural remedies to fight cancer and talking to doctors who had experience in beating cancer naturally. Then, I put together an advanced health protocol for my mom. The first thing we implemented was a massive change in Mom's diet. She started juicing vegetables and DR. JOSH'S STORY 12 | INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONconsuming homemade bone broth, antioxidant-rich blueberries, wild-caught salmon, probiotic-rich goat milk kefir and lots of organic green salads (yes, lots of kale!). Amongst my thousands of hours studying the best natural cancer fighters, I discovered the power of essential oils. I discovered essential oils such as frankincense, myrrh and oregano\u2014which are some of the most effective agents to fight against unhealthy, irregular cells in the body\u2014and started using these and other oils to support her health and to supplement the other natural cancer-fighting protocols we had implemented. Today, my mother is cancer-free and thriving\u2014and she uses essential oils now more than ever. I'm not claiming that essential oils alone are a treatment for cancer, but I absolutely do believe they can arm your body with powerful tools to win the battle against disease and regain your health when combined with key diet and lifestyle changes. Inspired by these efforts to not only save Mom's life, but also keep her healthy, I have made essential oils a part of my daily regimen. My wife and I use essential oils as a natural remedy for numerous health conditions, we use them for personal care and for cleaning, and I bring frankincense and lavender oils with me almost everywhere I go. I make my own homemade recipes with essential oils that have replaced so many of the products I used to buy, such as soap, shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste. I have now recommended essential oils to thousands of my patients and to family members. In fact, I believe they are the most under-utilized form of plant-based medicine in the world today. One of my life's missions is to help transform the health of this world by teaching people how to implement essential oils into their daily lives. Dr. Josh dancing with his mother at his wedding. 13 My journey with essential oils is equally personal and also involves a seemingly insurmountable battle with disease. My interest in essential oils initially was peaked after an intense study of the Bible in preparation for writing my book, The Maker's Diet, in 2003, a book that was inspired by my victory over Crohn's disease. In an effort to follow what a California nutrition expert deemed as \"God's Health Plan\" in order to overcome severe Crohn's disease and more than a dozen health maladies, I had voraciously studied hundreds of books and thousands of Biblical references on health and wellness in body, mind and spirit, and I began a diet of strictly whole foods consumed in Biblical times: raw, organically grown, sprouted whole grains; organic fruits and vegetables; fermented dairy; grass-fed beef; and pastured eggs and poultry. I also added a daily regimen of probiotics teeming with beneficial bacteria called soil-based organisms. Thanks to these efforts, I beat the doctors' prognoses and was once again living a vibrant and healthy life free of the supposedly incurable Crohn's disease. Through my studies, I was amazed to learn how valuable essential oils were in Biblical times\u2014often cherished more than gold. I also began to understand their therapeutic value when used topically, through olfaction (inhalation) and oral consumption, and I began to comprehend the tremendous value and widespread application of essential oils for an extensive number of conditions and ailments. Then came 2008\u2014when I was diagnosed with an aggressive metastatic cancer. Essential oils became a critical tool in the fight JORDAN'S STORY 14 | INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONand subsequent victory against catastrophic disease for the second time in my life, a triumph that came through natural and supernatural means and without the use of conventional treatments. During a 40-day period, I constructed a nutrition and detoxification program that involved the use of essential oils in multiple applications daily, including massaging my head and body with essential oils, diffusing oils 24 hours a day in my home, using them in hydrotherapy (shower, sauna and steam room) and consuming oils mixed in various nutritional beverages. I have now used essential oils consistently for the past nine years, and they represent an indispensable tool in my family's health arsenal. My family of eight uses essential oils orally, topically, in our skin and body care regimen, in wound care and in recipes each and every day. I also use essential oils daily during my meditation and quiet time with the Lord, and I anoint my wife and children daily with lavender oil while quoting parts of Psalm 23: \"I anoint your head with oil. Your cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the rest of your days and you will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" I'm so thankful for essential oils and the protective measure they provide against the germs, toxins and stress surrounding all of us when we travel and interact with others, and even within our own homes. I have also recommended essential oils to many individuals whom I have helped coach back to health. While essential oils have been such an important part of my daily life, I struggled to find a consistent source of practical information on the how and why of essential oils for the thousands of people who look to me for health coaching and guidance. That is why I teamed up with my good friends, Dr. Josh Axe and Ty Bollinger, to write Essential Oils: Ancient Medicine. We believe this book will demystify essential oils and provide you with the keys to unlock these powerful, hidden treasures inside the plants God created. 15 TY'S STORY When I graduated from Baylor University with a Masters in Taxation in 1991, you could never have told me that one day I'd be a worldwide health freedom advocate, but life has a way of revealing its plans for you in unique ways. My career and life path change began when my father, Graham Bollinger, was diagnosed with cancer on July 1, 1996. Just 25 days after the diagnosis, he died. My family and I were left in total shock after losing my father less than a month after discovering he had cancer, especially considering that at 52 years old, he was in excellent physical health at the time of his diagnosis. Dad had gone into the hospital with stomach pains, and we assumed the doctors would tell us it was gallstones. Instead, they informed us that he had numerous cancerous tumors in his stomach, and they were going to cut them out, which they proceeded to do. He bled to death over the next three weeks after the surgery. His death certificate says he died from cancer, but in reality, he died from the surgery to remove the tumors in his stomach. What was even more troubling was the fact that his initial prognosis indicated he could have lived another year or two without treatment. Over the course of the next seven years, both of my grandfathers, my grandmother, my dad's brother, a cousin and then finally my mother all died of cancer. Several of them died from the treatments for the cancer, not the cancer itself. At the age of 41, I became the oldest person left in my family. The entire experience woke me up to the fact that we are clearly missing the mark when it comes to the methods we utilize to 16 | INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONtreat cancer today. With a medical system that is so advanced in many areas, like trauma medicine, why are we still in the dark ages when it comes to cancer treatments? That is when my quest to learn all I possibly could about natural cancer treatments and the medical industry really began. In 2006, I wrote and published my first book, Cancer: Step Outside the Box. Before we knew it, the book was selling like crazy (it was #6 on Amazon at one point), and we had amassed a large following. Since then, I've written multiple books before embarking on another unexpected journey\u2014and that is filming, editing and producing documentary miniseries (\"docu-series\"). First, in the spring of 2014, we created a docu-series entitled The Quest for the Cures, which features my trek across the country interviewing patients, doctors, scientists and patients who all broke the code of silence to reveal some of the hidden truths about the cancer pandemic in our modern world. After the immense popularity of this docu-series, in the fall of 2014, we released The Quest for the Cures Continues. Then, in 2015, I traveled the globe and interviewed over 130 cancer experts and patients, and we released The Truth About Cancer: A Global Quest to the entire world.It is my mission to share the most remarkable discovery I made on my quests, which is that the vast majority of all diseases (including cancer) can be easily prevented and even cured without drugs or surgery. During my search for living a healthier life free from disease, I discovered some of the many benefits of essential oils. My family and I now use essential oils in our daily lives. My wife uses frankincense and myrrh every day behind her ears and on her lymph nodes as a prophylactic, and we love to diffuse various oils throughout our home every day for everything from added mental clarity to extra immune support for our four children and ourselves. During my research, I came to realize that essential oils are a largely overlooked piece of the health and disease treatment puzzle. As important and therapeutic as they are, they are still unknown and seem to be shrouded in mystery. Despite their enormous popularity, there are relatively few books that clearly explain the true benefits and uses of these gifts from God. I believe books like Essential Oils: Ancient Medicine are going to change that. People are going to discover that they can use essential oils in place of so much of what is being used today in conventional medicine. 17 We hope this book will become the go-to guide for anyone who wants to protect and improve their health through the use of essential oils, but we also wrote it with a few specific groups in mind. First, we believe Essential Oils: Ancient Medicine can become a powerful resource for doctors and health practitioners seeking to provide their patients and clients with the best possible improvements in their health. Second, the group of people who will benefit the most from reading this book will be moms. We know moms are dedicated warriors who are not only responsible for their own health but also charged with taking care of the health of their entire family. From children to pets to aging parents, they are constantly serving. If we could get a copy of this book into the hands of every mother in America, the health of our entire nation would radically change. Essential oils are no fad\u2014they are backed by thousands of years of history. They've been used in Biblical medicine, Egyptian medicine, Chinese medicine and Greek medicine\u2014and they're still used throughout the world today. In fact, they're actually more popular in many other parts of the world than they are in the U.S. Thankfully, America is now experiencing an essential oil revolution, and their use is growing in popularity every day. So, let's celebrate the fact that essential oils are becoming so popular! But it needs to stay that way\u2014and in order for that to happen, you need to have easily accessible information that is simple to understand and implement. We designed this book to give you clear, easy ways to use essential oils to benefit both your health and your family's health every single day. Our recommendations are supported by history and science. There are now thousands of research studies proving that essential oils are effective natural remedies and amazing ingredients for personal care and cleaning products\u2014and we have utilized a great deal of this research in the writing of this book.DESIGNED WITH YOU IN MIND 18 | INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONSo many of the diseases we see today are due to high levels of toxicity present within our bodies; chemical toxicants that have become insidious invaders in our daily lives through the foods we eat, the medicines we take, the products we use and even the water we drink. Part of our collective mission is to teach people how to live free of toxins and medications. Essential oils can be used as a natural replacement for some medications, conventional personal care products, body products and home cleaning products. Essential oils can be used in so many ways that their only real limit is from a lack of knowledge of safe and proper use\u2014and that is precisely what this book is designed to give you. With the right tools in your arsenal, you and your family can experience a total medicine cabinet\u2014and life\u2014transformation. If you are ready to experience more energy, better health, balanced hormones, improved digestion and an overall higher quality of life, then you have found the right resource at the right time. We want to provide you with everything you need to know about essential oils and everything you need to use them effectively, all in one place. We hope this book provides you with the answers you've been looking for.Ultimately, we want you to use this book to accomplish three things in your life: To be educated about what essential oils are and why they are so powerful. To feel empowered to use essential oils both safely and effectively to support your health and your family's health. To be equipped with this trusted manual to turn to for utilizing essentials oils in your daily life\u2014from boo-boos and stuffy noses to chemical-free personal care and household items and natural pet care. 1. 2. 3. 19 PART I ESSENTIAL OIL FOUNDATIONSCHAPTER 1 FROM THE THIRD DAY TO THE MODERN DAY11 Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the third day.After talking one day, the three of us discovered that our mornings start the same way\u2014with praying, reading the Bible and meditating (oftentimes while applying or diffusing frankincense oil). In the course of our Bible studies of creation, it dawned on us that essential oils from plants have been available to mankind since the very beginning. More specifically, according to Genesis 1: 11-13: Because essential oils are derived from plants, we realized that on the third day of creation, even before God breathed life into Adam and well before sin, disease and death became reality, He created all the supportive tools and treatments everyone on this Earth would need for illnesses, ailments, aches and pains and placed them, quite literally, at our fingertips. Now let's fast-forward to our use of these tools and treatments in the modern day. When Jordan was battling cancer in 2008, there was no shortage of people who believed his best chance of beating the disease was through one of conventional medicine's answers to cancer treatment. But he would not be deterred from his path to fight cancer naturally, and thanks to prayer, cleansing, a strict diet, a specific regimen of supplements and his use of essential oils, he beat the diagnosis\u2014and he came out of cancer healthier than he was before. Dr. Josh can relate to that victory. After his mother underwent chemotherapy for her first bout with breast cancer, she felt sicker after being pronounced \"cancer-free\" than she had felt while battling the disease. When the Axe family chose to fight her second cancer diagnosis through alternative treatments and lifestyle changes, his mother emerged healthier than she had ever been in her life. Sadly, Ty's mother and father never got that second chance. 24 | HISTORYHISTORYWe don't know a single person who has not lost a friend or loved one from cancer or some other form of disease. You may even be dealing with a diagnosis right now, and if you are, you are certainly not alone. According to the American Cancer Society, men have a 1 in 2 probability of developing cancer in their lifetimes, and 1 out of every 3 women will battle some form of cancer. Whether you picked up this book looking for natural remedies for what ails you or as an overall reference, this is an exciting time. Essential oils can change your life, and together, we can prevent disease and change the way the world treats illness. Armed with the right information, we can spread the word and change the status quo. We believe this is possible because the information in this book is backed by the latest scientific research, historical documentation and Biblical wisdom. It's time to change the way we view disease; it's time to change the products we are bringing into our homes and putting into our bodies. This is a critical situation, and we are facing serious problems in the world today. Conventional treatments for both major and minor conditions are killing people. For example, diabetic drugs are causing vitamin B12 deficiency and permanent nerve damage. Drugs for depression are causing widespread dependencies, and the consequences of withdrawal include seizures and death. Drugs for high blood pressure are causing impotence among men and heart disease due to the vitamin and mineral deficiencies they cause. Drugs for lowering cholesterol are causing organ damage, memory loss and sexual dysfunction. That's just a short list of the side effects of prescription drugs and doesn't include a discussion of the hundreds of drugs that have been overprescribed and resulted in a serious worldwide addiction epidemic. It also doesn't include the countless over-the-counter (OTC) drugs people use every day like acetaminophen, which has been linked to kidney disease and increased risk of heart attack and stroke. According to an article published by the Harvard School of Public Health, there are nearly 2 million hospitalizations and 128,000 deaths every year from properly prescribed medications. This makes prescription drugs a major health risk, ranking it fourth among the leading causes of death. 1 Conversely, how many reported deaths are from vitamins, supplements and essential oils each year? ZERO. 25 The solution for these serious and significant side effects is not more drugs. Modern medicine is designed to target the symptoms of disease and not the source of the problem. It's like getting a nail stuck in your car tire, and instead of removing the nail, you just keep filling up the tire with more air\u2014without ever removing the nail. If you do not address the source of the issue (the nail), the air will continue to leak and eventually result in other problems, no matter how many times you patch it up and expect it to function properly. The solution to this problem is found right in nature. We must remove as many of the toxins from our lives as possible (which come at us in our food, in our water, in our personal care and cleaning products, and in our air) and replace conventional medicines and products with innovations specifically designed by the Great Physician to heal, not to cause further harm. There has never been a more critical time to act than now. Over 1,500 people a day are dying of cancer, and over 600,000 people will die of heart disease this year. And for the rest of us, quality of life is deteriorating thanks to poor diet and lifestyle choices, including our reliance on conventional drugs. You don't have to wait for widespread mindset and policy changes to start acting. We believe you can start affecting change today\u2014right now\u2014through small, but specific actions. For example, if you want to combat high blood pressure, start by using a combination of lavender, ylang ylang and frankincense. Diffuse cinnamon oil, grapefruit oil and ginger oil at your desk at work to support blood sugar balance. In clinical trials, essential oils have been proven to elevate moods, so start breathing in some bergamot, lavender and Roman chamomile to fight depression. 2,3,4 The world of medicine offers many great wonders, and modern medicine and diagnostics are amazing on many levels. But the system is broken, largely due to the prevalence of pharmaceutical drugs being touted as cures. Before the age of modern medicine, people did not rely on large drug companies for Band-Aid cures that often cause more problems than they treat. Instead, they relied on natural remedies made from plants to prevent and treat ailments. They relied on traditional herbal remedies like essential oils. The funny thing about the word \"traditional\" is that people use it today to 26 | HISTORYHISTORY27 refer to medical practices that have only been around for 100 years or less. Medical professionals and others then lump essential oils into the \"alternative\" category, when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. It is herbal remedies and essential oils that are \"traditional,\" as they have been around since the third day of creation! We believe in using the \"traditional\" treatments\u2014in other words, those that come from the Earth. It's easy for people today to pass herbs, spices and essential oils off as \"just plants,\" and that is because we've been conditioned to believe that \"medicine\" has to come from a lab. But we believe that God's laboratory is far superior to the ones human beings have created, and that is precisely why you now hold this book in your hands. When you use \"God's Pharmacy\" to treat your ailments and to provide preventative medicine, the options for treatment and healing are far more plentiful, the side effects are not so terrifying, and the results are longer lasting. In order to more fully understand the inherent power and beautiful simplicity of God's Pharmacy, let's travel back in time to find out just how important essential oils once were before Earth was littered with pharmacies on every corner. 27 ESSENTIAL OIL'S BIBLICAL ROOTS Essential oils have been an integral part of the daily lives of people for thousands of years. At least 33 specific essential oils and aromatic oil-producing plants are mentioned in the Bible, and the word \"incense\" is mentioned 68 times in Scripture. Psalm 45:7-8, Proverbs 27:9, Isaiah 61:3 and Hebrews 1:9 all reference oils in some way, as in \"the oil of joy\" and \"the oil of gladness,\" and they speak of how oils \"rejoice the heart.\" Essential oils are also referred to in the Bible as fragrances, odors, ointments, aromas, perfumes and sweet savors. 5 In total, there are over 600 references to essential oils and/or the aromatic plants from which they were extracted in the Bible. For those of us who study the Bible, we know that the Holy Scripture is not filled with insignificant details. Therefore, there is obviously a tremendous importance surrounding oils and their many uses. Oils such as frankincense, myrrh, rosemary, hyssop and spikenard were used for anointing and healing the sick. Moses and other Old Testament figures used essential oils to anoint kings and leaders; priests also used them for healing purposes. In fact, in Exodus 30:22-25, Moses was given a specific formula directly by God: 28 | HISTORYHISTORY22 Then the Lord said to Moses, 23 \"Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels [around 12 pounds] of liquid myrrh, half as much [around six pounds] of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels [around six pounds] of fragrant calamus, 24 500 shekels [around 12 pounds] of cassia\u2014all according to the sanctuary shekel\u2014and a hin [around a gallon] of olive oil. 25 Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.\" This formula was used to make a holy anointing oil that was poured onto the heads of those being appointed king or for those being prayed for by the priest. In other words, this anointing oil wasn't just used for rituals, but it was also known to have healing properties. Another important reference to a holy anointing oil was when King David was anointed by Samuel in 1 Samuel 16: 12-13: 12 \"So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the Lord said, 'Rise and anoint him; this is the one.' 13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David.\" When Jesus was born, the Bible tells us that three wise men from the far east gave the infant King gifts of gold to honor his royalty, frankincense as a perfume and myrrh for anointing oil. In those days, frankincense oil was often rubbed on children to reduce swelling because of its anti-inflammatory qualities as well as immune protection. Myrrh oil was known as a natural antiseptic and may have been put on the infant Jesus' umbilical cord area, as well as been applied to his mother, Mary, to help heal tissues and balance hormones. There are also four different Gospel accounts of women honoring Jesus by anointing him with oil (also referred to as \"expensive perfume\" and \"ointment\"). John 12:3 tells of a particularly touching story in which Mary, the sister of Lazarus, performed this special action to pay tribute to Jesus: 12 \"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.\" In Esther's era, according to Esther 2:12, the future queen underwent \"a six-month treatment with the oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and other aloes.\" Queen Esther bathed in myrrh and olive oil for six months before her presentation to the king in order to purify her body. Note that the essential oils referenced 29 in history and throughout the Bible were often herbs mixed with olive oil and not identical to what we think of as an essential oil today. (For more on how essential oils are made today as opposed to their production in Biblical times, see Chapter 3). God created these wonderful resources for mankind's use\u2014and undoubtedly for the eventual use of every subsequent generation. He gave us everything we need to support ourselves on an emotional, physical, mental and spiritual level, including wonderful aromatic plants and essential oils. 30 | HISTORYHere are 12 of the most revered oils of the Bible and their historic uses: 1. Frankincense. Frankincense is the king of the oils. It was used as a primary component of the holy incense, a medicine and a currency\u2014and of course, it was a gift from the wise men to baby Jesus. In fact, at the time of Jesus' birth, both frankincense and myrrh may have been worth more than their weight in the third gift: gold. 2. Myrrh. Quoted in Scripture 156 times as having a variety of uses, including as an ointment, an incense, an embalming ingredient and used as a skin beauty treatment by Queen Esther in Esther 2:12. By far, myrrh's most common usage in the Bible is as a part of holy anointing oil. 3. Cinnamon. Like myrrh, cinnamon oil was a chief ingredient in holy anointing oil and used to cleanse the air, kill mold and act as a natural medicine. In Proverbs 7:17, Solomon uses this aromatic oil in the bedroom and as a natural perfume or cologne. 4. Cedarwood. King Solomon used cedarwood in building God's temple and Jesus was crucified on a cross made of cedarwood or cypress. It was thought to bring wisdom, was used for ritual cleansing and served as medicine in treating skin conditions and leprosy. 5. Spikenard. In Biblical times, \"nard\" was not only a very expensive perfume but also a precious ointment that was used as medicine. Interestingly, the \"spikenard\" used in the Bible may have in fact been lavender oil. In John 12:3, the Bible tells how spikenard was used to anoint Jesus just days before His death and resurrection.THE 12 OILS OF THE BIBLE HISTORY6. Hyssop. In the Old Testament, God commanded His people to use hyssop in the ceremonial cleansing of people and houses. Hyssop appears at Jesus' crucifixion, when the Roman soldiers offered Jesus a drink of wine vinegar on a sponge at the end of a stalk of hyssop. 7. Cassia. An herb very similar to cinnamon, cassia is the fourth ingredient listed in the holy anointing oil detailed in Exodus 30:24. It may have been brought out of Egypt when the Israelites fled Pharaoh and was commonly used with myrrh and aloes to scent garments. 8. Sandalwood (aloes). In Scripture, sandalwood is referred to as \"aloes\" and is called one of the oils of joy and gladness along with frankincense, myrrh and cedarwood. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea brought sandalwood (aloes) and myrrh to bury Jesus, and in today's market, the amount of oils used would be worth an estimated $200,000! 9. Cypress. Cypress is celebrated in Scripture as a symbol of strength, security and prosperity. The Bible mentions cypress as the choice wood for building, trading and even weaponry. In Genesis 6:14, God commanded Noah to \"make yourself an ark of gopher wood,\" which in modern English is in fact \"cypress.\" 10. Galbanum. Galbanum is a main ingredient of the holy incense used in the heart of the temple in Exodus 30:34. Interestingly, although galbanum itself has a somewhat foul odor, when burned with other sweet smelling oils in holy incense, it has the most beautiful scent and was thought to balance the emotions. 11. Rose of Sharon. Mentioned in the Song of Solomon, the rose of Sharon is not really a \"rose\" but instead similar to the hibiscus or tulip (which is also a source of saffron). Some Bible expositors see the rose of Sharon as Christ and the lily as the church, His bride. 12. Calamus. Also known as \"sweet cane,\" calamus is an ancient herb that is perhaps what we now know as lemongrass. In Biblical times, calamus was used in perfumes, incense and as an ingredient in the special holy anointing oil used by the priests in the temple. 31 THE EGYPTIANS EXTREME OIL LOVERS In the days of Pharaoh, Egyptians made extensive use of essential oils in medicine and burial practices. The process of embalming and mummification was developed at this time, as the Egyptians searched for immortality. Frankincense, myrrh, galbanum, cinnamon, cedarwood, juniper berry and spikenard were used to preserve the bodies of their royalty in preparation for the afterlife; in fact, when King Tut's tomb was opened in 1923, archaeologists discovered 50 alabaster jars that contained essential oils, several of them completely full! Aromatherapy (also known as essential oil therapy) was used in combination with their religious practices and mysticism. The Egyptians burned incense made from aromatic wood, herbs and spices in honor of their gods; they believed that as the smoke rose up to the heavens, it carried their prayers and wishes to the gods. Entire Egyptian temples were dedicated to the production and blending of oils, where oil recipes were written on the walls in hieroglyphics. 32 | HISTORYHISTORY33 The Egyptians also used essential oils as part of their daily lives. The women of Egypt would use fragranced oils after bathing to rejuvenate their skin and protect them from the sun. Cleopatra, once considered the most beautiful woman in the world, was known to use essential oils. She used oils like rose, frankincense, cypress, neroli and myrrh for her personal beauty treatments. The queen was often described as \"clouded in a scent of mystery.\" (We're not entirely sure if a \"scent of mystery\" is a good thing or a bad thing, but it certainly speaks to her love of essential oils.) Today, we are finally beginning to embrace the wisdom of the Jews and Egyptians by using essential oils to combat the detrimental effects of stress and simultaneously restore beauty, peace and harmony into our daily lives. 33 THE CHINESE PIONEERING THE USE OF OILS AS MEDICINE The ancient Chinese also believed in the power of essential oils. Some speculate that the Chinese may have begun studying aromatics at the same time as the Egyptians, or even before. The oldest surviving medical text is Shennong's Herbal, dated around 2700 B.C. Shennong was a mythical sage ruler of prehistoric China who reportedly consumed hundreds of herbs and tested their medicinal value. The upper class citizens in China also used plant oils frequently during the T'ang dynasties to scent their homes, clothing, temples, ink, paper and cosmetics. In ancient Chinese medicine, it is understood that herbs have specific actions and properties. Some herbs are cooling, while others are warming; some herbs invigorate and others sedate. Each herb is explained through its energetics as well as its actions and effects. It is believed that the concepts of \"Qi\" (your life energy) and \"Yin and Yang\" (or Yin-Yang) form the base of this medical system. 34 | HISTORYHISTORYFor example, low Qi can be detected by feeling a weak pulse, low energy levels, hypothyroidism or depression. Having a Yin deficiency often presents as dry skin, food cravings and trouble sleeping. A Yang deficiency is often correlated with low libido, physical weakness and poor self-esteem. In Chinese medicine, a practitioner may use a Yang essential oil such as ginger, which has warming properties to aid in digestion and help clear dampness (candida and colds) from the body. Then, they may use a Yin strengthening essential oil such as geranium to treat infertility and improve skin health. And then, to boost the body's Qi, thyme oil can effectively treat conditions such as low energy and weakness. This method of diagnosis and treatment was a fascinating and forward-thinking early application of \"holistic medicine,\" which is a form of medicine that emphasizes the need to look at the whole person (including analysis of all physical, emotional or spiritual imbalances) in the quest for optimal health and wellness. As you can see, ancient Chinese medicine is an advanced form of holistic healing that has harnessed the benefits of essential oils for thousands of years. 35 THE GREEKS BOTANY TRAILBLAZERS Botany, also known as plant science, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. The term \"botany\" comes from an Ancient Greek word meaning \"pasture\" or \"grass.\" Historically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants, and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Therefore, the study of essential oils falls under the botany umbrella\u2014and there are several men who are credited with creating and describing many of the fundamental principles of the science: Hippocrates. Hippocrates is referred to as the \"Father of Western Medicine,\" even though much of what he did would today be considered holistic. Hippocrates documented over 200 different herbs during his lifetime; he believed that plant-based medicine could save lives and surgery should only be used as a last resort. He was also one of the first to believe that diseases were caused naturally rather than view them as punishments by the gods. 36 | HISTORYHISTORY37 Theophrastus. Known as the \"Founder of Botany,\" Theophrastus wrote several botanical works. The History of Plants became one of the most valued botanical science references for centuries to come. Theophrastus investigated everything about plants and even how specific scents and different flowers' aromatic properties affected people's emotions. Pedanius Dioscorides. Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek military physician, pharmacologist and botanist. Between 50 and 70 A.D., Dioscorides wrote a five-volume book entitled De Materia Medica (meaning \"On Medical Material\"), which became the precursor to all modern pharmacopeias. In it, Dioscorides discussed 600 plants in total\u2014detailing their descriptions, habitats, proper preparation, storage and healing properties. Claudius Galen. Claudius Galen was a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman Empire. Galen began his medical career working with gladiators by treating their wounds with medicinal herbs. He is often credited with helping to spread the doctrine of Humorism, which is a system of medicine detailing the makeup and workings of the human body, and it suggests that the human body is filled with four basic substances, called humors, which are in balance when a person is healthy. Galen's system and the pioneering efforts of these men allowed physicians to formulate and prescribe medicines more accurately. In short, Greek Medicine became a system for healing that treats the person, not the symptoms of disease. OILS CRUSADE INTO EUROPE As civilizations transferred world power, the essential oil techniques from Greece traveled to Rome and favored aromatherapy and fragrances. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Persia picked up these healing techniques and perfected the essential oil distillation process that is still used today. During the Crusades, the Knights and their armies were responsible for passing on knowledge of herbal medicines that they learned in the Middle East throughout Western Europe. The knights acquired knowledge of distillation and carried perfumes with them. (For more on the distillation process, see Chapter 3.) 38 | HISTORYHISTORY39 This holistic approach to treating health conditions was largely rejected during the Dark Ages. During this era, it is believed that monks continued the healing tradition of essential oils and secretly kept herbal medicine alive in the halls of the monasteries. Because the Catholic Church viewed bathing as inappropriate during this time, the citizens favored aromatics to keep foul odors at bay. What they didn't realize is that many of these oils where also anti-bacterial, which meant that their perfume was also helping them to stave off sickness and disease. After the invention of the modern distillation process, the popularity of essential oils spread through Europe. When the Great Plague became widespread, fumigations were conducted using aromatics to drive out sickness from the cities. In London, houses and workplaces were fumigated on a daily basis, and this reportedly protected the citizens from the plague. The oils were valued because of their anti-microbial properties, especially lavender and frankincense. History tells us that there are several variations of a protective blend that were used to guard citizens from the plague. One such blend was called \"Four Thieves,\" and the legend states that it was a powerful blend of vinegar, herbs and oils. While the legend changes as much as the precise formula for this blend, the gist of the story is this:During the plagues (the Black Plague is the most common one cited), a group of four brothers began robbing the dead. At first, their crimes were largely ignored, because everyone knew they would eventually pay the price by catching the plague themselves. To everyone's surprise, they managed to avoid catching the plague and continued robbing graves, amassing a great deal of wealth. They became legendary, and everyone wanted to know how they managed to escape what seemed like inevitable death. When they were finally captured, it was discovered that these men were the sons of a perfumer and herbalist, and they had learned about essential oils from their parents during childhood. Thanks to their parents' knowledge, the brothers knew a certain combination of oils would protect them, so they rubbed this concoction on their bodies and used the blend to clean anything they brought back from infected homes and gravesites. The powerful, legendary blend typically contains some combination of eucalyptus, clove, rosemary, thyme and sage. Although the details of this story may never be fully verified, one thing is certain. The oils in that blend were once widely known to fight disease and protect the body, and a whole host of other oils continued to be used in perfumes, medicine and other uses for many centuries. MODERN MEDICINE EMERGES 40 | HISTORYBy the 1800s, pharmaceutical companies emerged, including Abbott, Parke-Davis and Squibb. Eventually, pioneering drug companies like Pfizer, Bayer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson became mainstream, and although these companies were still using plant- based medicines, synthetic drugs were gaining momentum. By the 20th century, many people stopped using whole-plant remedies and essential oils; instead, drug manufacturers offered convenient and effective medications, including penicillin and insulin. These modern and life-saving discoveries left the idea of plants as medicine in the dust\u2014and there essential oils sat for many years, joining the realm of seemingly obsolete folk medicine. HISTORY41 In 1928, essential oil use began to reemerge when French chemist Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9 used lavender oil to heal a burn on his hand. He then decided to further analyze the properties of lavender oil and how it could be used to treat other types of skin infections, wounds or burns. With this, the term \"aromatherapy\" was officially born. Gattefoss\u00e9 and a colleague conducted further research on the healing properties of lavender and introduced it to many of the hospitals in France. During the outbreak of Spanish influenza, there were no reported deaths of hospital personnel, which was credited to the use of lavender. The use of these oils continued to spread once again throughout Europe, especially with practitioners of alternative medicine, such as massage therapists and beauticians. Aromatherapy did not become popular in the U.S. until the 1980s, when product makers began to add essential oils to various lotions, candles and perfumes. Today, there are trained professionals such as aromatherapists, herbalists, massage therapists, nutritionists and doctors of natural medicine who use aromatherapy in their practices and are trained in specific uses for essential oils. Even so, their use as medicine is so highly contested and has undergone such harsh scrutiny in recent years that it has caused many people to wonder, \"Are essential oils the real deal?\" The answer is a resounding YES, essential oils are \"real\" and, when used properly, are effective without side effects, unlike their synthetic drug counterparts. By incorporating essential oils into your daily life, you can make over your health, home and body and create a medicine and personal care cabinet fit for a king or queen. According to the NIH (National Institute of Health) PubMed database, there are currently 17,277 medical studies on essential oils, many proving their therapeutic benefits. Essential oils have been used to support the body, mind and spirit since before the time of recordkeeping. They were long looked upon as sources of healing, and they were highly prized and valued. In fact, Proverbs 21:20 says: \"There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise.\" The possession of oil in one's house was once a sign of wisdom\u2014and we believe it can be that way again. Medicine doesn't have to be so complicated. Health and healing don't have to be so elusive. You simply have to unlock the power of the plants that God made on the third day of creation in order to both simplify your life and enjoy a happier, healthier existence for you and your family. CHAPTER 2 CONTROVERSY, CURES AND HEALING COMPOUNDSIn the search for healthy alternatives to prescription drugs, chemical household cleaners and toxic personal care products, essential oils were the natural answer for the three of us. When Jordan became a father, he knew he wanted to use only the safest products and natural medicines for his children. With six kids at home, Jordan and his wife Nicki feel good about the fact that they use oils of frankincense, lemon and thyme to support their children's immune systems during cold and flu season. They also exclusively use shampoos and cleansers made with botanicals and essential oils such as rosemary and clove, which contain free radical-fighting antioxidants. Dr. Josh and his wife Chelsea appreciate that when you walk in their door, it smells great inside\u2014and not because of chemically laden air fresheners, but because of the essential oils they diffuse. Their soap is filled with lemongrass, Roman chamomile and aloe vera that work to naturally clean. After a workout, they like to rub on an essential oil blend that contains turmeric, peppermint and rosemary for relief from sore and tired muscles. Ty also diffuses oils in his home to purify the air and to enhance his and his family's natural immune response. He and his wife Charlene use oils like ginger to ease an upset stomach when one of their three children feels unwell, since studies have shown that when ginger oil is inhaled or consumed, it is effective in reducing nausea. 6,7 They also use lavender, with its highly known anti-microbial properties, to speed the healing of their kids' cuts and scrapes. Essential oils have become so common in our households that we could not imagine our daily lives without them. But you may wonder, what exactly are essential oils? How are they different from other oils? Why are they so powerful? There have also been a lot of questions concerning proper usage and safety of essential oils. In the next few chapters, we will answer your questions by first explaining what essential oils really are and how they are made today and then providing the most critical information every essential oil user needs to know to use them safely and effectively. In this chapter, we will start with the most basic fundamentals for those who are new to essential oils, or for those want to know more about their 44 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSderivation and properties. The sections in Chapters 2 and 3 each begin with a question, and you can use the headings as an educational resource or a quick reference guide for answers to some of the most frequent questions we receive about essential oils. We believe the reason some people don't understand the power of essential oils is because they don't have the right information. This is your opportunity to gain the best knowledge and empower your health and well-being. 45 Essential oils certainly don't seem like \"oil\" in the most widely recognized sense. To understand essential oils a little better, let's first examine the other more common family of oils called \"fixed oils.\" Fixed oils are non-volatile (which means they don't evaporate into the air) oils of animal or plant origin; they are the ones we all know the best and often use in the kitchen (such as olive, grapeseed and coconut). Essential oils, which are known as \"volatile oils,\" function very differently from these oils because they evaporate readily and will pass more easily and more quickly into the body through the skin. The oil's volatility is what makes it aromatic and useful in aromatherapy\u2014the molecules released as vapor into the air carry the essential oil's scent. For instance, if you put coconut oil on your skin, it will still look \"oily\" or \"greasy\" two minutes later; but if you put frankincense oil on your skin, two minutes later there will be no remnant of it because some has evaporated and the rest penetrated your skin and is being passed deeply into the cells, tissues, organs and bloodstream. Essential oils are obtained from plants\u2014including flowers, leaves, roots, barks and peels\u2014using a steam-distillation, cold pressing or CO2 extraction process. Some companies sell plant extracts that they call essential oils, but to be a true essential oil, an extract must be obtained without the use of chemical solvents. We will discuss how to ascertain the quality of essential oils in the next chapter. WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL OILS?When something is described as \"essential,\" it is only natural to think of the item as a necessary thing since that is often what the word \"essential\" means. For instance, some vitamins and minerals are described as being essential because the body can't produce them and requires them to remain healthy. Essential amino acids are those that the body needs but cannot produce on its own. These amino acids must be derived from the foods we eat. Given the use of the word \"essential\" to describe nutrients that our bodies need, it is no wonder that there is some confusion as to what essential oils are and why we call them essential. However, when used to describe essential oils, the word \"essential\" is a different word altogether. It is a shortened version of the word \"quintessential.\" In modern times, the word \"quintessential\" means \"embodying or possessing the essence of something.\" This essence is the term that describes essential oils; these natural liquids are drawn from the very essence of the plant. The word \"quintessential\" has a history that dates back to the discovery of essential oils, and the two have been interlinked since that time. \"Quintessential\" can be literally translated to mean \"the fifth essence.\" This quinta essentia was thought to be the fifth and highest element, and it was believed that when the quinta essentia combined with earth, air, fire and water, it made up the whole of a being. The quintessence was the life force or spirit of the being or plant. A similar comparison in humans would be the word \"pneuma\" (also spelled numa or nooma), which means the spirit or \"breath of life\" in the Bible. While essential oils aren't really comprised of the spirit of the plant, they are the plant's essence. That essence is made up of beneficial compounds that can support our health in numerous ways.WHY ARE THEY CALLED \"ESSENTIAL\" OILS? 46 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSPlants are more complex than many imagine; they are the only living things that can produce their own energy using the light of the sun. The rest of us, human and animal alike, are dependent on plants at some level to provide us with the energy and nutrients we need for survival. Plants, though not sentient, have an \"intelligence\" of their own. More than just roots, stems and leaves, plants have a complicated system of communication, both within each individual plant and also with the surrounding environment. These communications are made by means of chemical messengers. 8 These natural plant chemicals are created with unique tastes, aromas and colors to protect the plant from predators, sweet smells to attract pollinators and coatings to keep bacteria and fungi at bay. Some plants even release a chemical that prevents competing plant species from growing in the first plant's territory! This is fundamentally why essential oils are so powerful as natural remedies. We are capturing the healing properties of the plant and using them to support our own bodies. For instance, most flowers give off scents that are attractive in nature to bees. Similarly, throughout history, women have used floral oils such as rose, jasmine and lavender to attract men. The plants of oregano and thyme naturally repel pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites in nature, actions that protect the plant itself. When we use their oils, they can benefit our bodies in the same way if we suffer with infections from candida, the flu or the common cold. As you can see, essential oils are complex and life-giving compounds that benefit the plant as well as humans. As it says in Genesis 1:12, \"The land produced vegetation, all sorts of seed- bearing plants and trees with seed bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.\" You can harness more of the goodness that God gave us by using essential oils. HOW DO ESSENTIAL OILS WORK? 47 When trying any new product, it is important to remember that everybody is different. \"Natural\" is not a synonym for \"safe.\" Essential oils are highly concentrated compounds. Whether inhaled, applied to the skin or consumed, using this level of concentration means that any sensitivity or allergy to the source plant will be magnified. Strong fragrances may trigger respiratory reactions in people with asthma or similar conditions, and applying the oil directly to your skin may cause a skin reaction. Additionally, some plants have natural medicinal qualities that can react with your prescribed medications or exacerbate a medical condition. So, to be safe, always start slowly when using a new essential oil. Dilute the oil before using it on your skin. Check with your physician if you are taking medication or suffer from allergies. Furthermore, some essential oils should be avoided if you are pregnant. It is always a good idea to research the specific risks associated with the essential oil you are considering.ARE ESSENTIAL OILS SAFE? 48 | FOUNDATIONS FOUNDATIONS Quality of the essential oil being utilized: Adulterated essential oils increase the likelihood of an adverse response. Therefore, the need for pure, authentic and genuine essential oils is of the utmost importance (see the oil quality guidelines under \"How Can I Tell I'm Getting the Best Oils?\" in Chapter 3). Chemical composition of the oil: Essential oils rich in aldehydes (like cinnamon) and phenols (like clove and oregano) may cause skin reactions. The oils rich in these constituents should always be diluted prior to application to the skin (see safety precautions in Chapter 5). Method of application: Essential oils may be applied on the skin (dermal application), inhaled, diffused or taken internally. Each of these methods has safety considerations (see safety precautions in regard to method of application in Chapter 5). Dosage/dilution applied: Essential oils are highly concentrated, and a little bit goes a long way. When using topically, a carrier oil may be used. Any excessive usage of essential oils may cause irritation or other undesired effects due to their lipophilic (fat-liking) nature (for more on proper application and dilution, see Chapter 5). Integrity of skin: Damaged, diseased or inflamed skin is often more penetrable and may be more sensitive to dermal reactions. It is potentially dangerous to put undiluted essential oils onto damaged, diseased or inflamed skin. Age of user: Infants, toddlers and young children are more sensitive to essential oils. Also, some essential oils should simply be avoided for children, pregnant and breastfeeding women and the elderly.1. 2. 3. For a more complete list of safety information and precautions for using essential oils, refer to the safety guidelines in Chapter 5 and throughout this book. 49 4. 5. 6.ESSENTIAL OIL SAFETY FACTORS According to the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy, factors that influence the safety of essential oils include:Many modern medicines include plant-derived compounds, and as we discussed in Chapter 1, ancient remedies were based on natural ingredients. Herbalists and natural healers have known about the benefits of botanicals for generations. Yet widespread information about essential oils remains limited until recently, when the number of published articles and research studies available on the effectiveness of essential oils has skyrocketed. In many instances, studies have shown a correlation between a specific essential oil and a health benefit, and we will share this information throughout the book. The use of essential oils in the U.S. for therapeutic purposes is still limited, but medical aromatherapy is common in Europe, where essential oils are most often used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Approximately 100 varieties of essential oils are used in Austria and Europe for aromatherapeutic purposes. The benefits of essential oils are probably best realized when they are used as a supplement or adjunct to other treatment protocols, along with a healthy diet of real food that comes from nature and is free from chemicals, pesticides, antibiotics and added hormones. The use of essential oils can enhance your life in many ways, but they are not cure-alls. If you are dealing with a serious disease, their use should be a part of a supervised treatment plan. Now that you know the basic what and why of essentials oils, in the next chapter, you will discover more about how they are farmed and then extracted. What is amazing is that each and every plant has unique properties that make it ideal for unique, specific uses. God put such thought and meticulous design into each plant from which we extract these amazing oils. He really is the ultimate scientist.CAN ESSENTIAL OILS CURE DISEASE? 50 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS51 51 CHAPTER 3 GO ORGANIC AND GET WILDIn today's toxic world, going organic and following a holistic approach to health is more important than ever. We know that many health conditions\u2014from autism to cancer and autoimmune disease to eczema\u2014have been linked to toxicity. And if you're like us, you want to keep your home and family toxic-free by only purchasing the highest quality foods, supplements and essential oils. One action the three of us all believe in very strongly is supporting organic farming methods that are free of pesticides and allowing plants to grow to their peak ripeness before being harvested and extracted without the use of chemicals. We've all been exposed to the ugly side of modern-day agriculture and the heavy toll our planet is paying\u2014all in the name of greed and profit. Sourcing exclusively from organic, non-GMO growers is a great first step, but Jordan wanted to do more. That is why he started the Beyond Organic Ranch and Heal the Planet Farm in southern Missouri. What you will find there is nothing short of amazing when you consider how most of our food is raised. The livestock on Jordan's farm, including cows, sheep, goats and chickens, are \"pasture raised,\" which means their food comes from grazing in open pastures, the water they drink is from a deep aquifer and they are some of the best cared for animals in the world. Likewise, all of the crops grown on Heal the Planet Farm are organic and grown without the use of chemicals. Pierre Chardin, a French philosopher and Jesuit priest, bestowed this wisdom upon the world: The future belongs to those who give the next generation hope. That is why Jordan likes to say, \"We are farming for our future.\" Since essential oils are derived from plants, this is a relevant discussion because an essential oil is only as good as the plant from which it originated. This chapter will educate you on the proper making of essential oils, what to look for in terms of quality and some critical issues when it comes to safety. If you are like us, you are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure a healthy future for your family. Those actions should include using only the highest quality essential oils that are properly farmed, harvested and extracted for maximum therapeutic benefit. 54 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS55 The farming of essential oil plants is a highly specialized process. It is also extremely important, because just as the type of food and water given to a cow affects the toxicity level of the dairy or meat it produces, the terrain and soil used to grow the plants directly correlates to the purity of the oils. Plants must be both grown and harvested by knowledgeable farmers who will allow the plant time to mature properly and without the use of harsh chemicals or pesticides. If a field is sprayed with toxic chemicals, this affects the chemistry of the plants and, ultimately, their therapeutic quality. For instance, a recent study done on blueberries found that wild Alaskan blueberries contain 3 to 5 times more antioxidants than conventional blueberries grown in North America. 9 This demonstrates the difference the proper soil, climate and harvesting method make in creating an exceptional food, supplement or essential oil. Most essential oil crops do well in temperate, Mediterranean and subtropical regions. For example, lavender is a Mediterranean plant, and it requires a similar climate to thrive. The Provence region of France is where most lavender is commercially grown, as the climate, with mild winters and warm, sunny summers, is ideal for lavender production. Because of environmental toxicity and soil depletion, crops grown just decades ago were much richer in vitamins and minerals than are the varieties most of us get today\u2014and with the growing popularity of essential oils, essential oil crops are in danger of being grown in over-farmed, depleted soil, which would in turn lessen their therapeutic benefit. Just like the animals and crops on Jordan's farm, essential oil plants do best when they are allowed to grow and thrive in an environment that most closely resembles the wild\u2014given no chemicals, situated in their ideal climate, allowed to grow to maturity in nutrient-rich soil and fed with natural sunlight and the purest water available.HOW ARE ESSENTIAL OIL PLANTS FARMED?HOW ARE ESSENTIAL OILS MADE? 56 | FOUNDATIONSEssential oils are present inside the plants because God created the oils for highly specific purposes within their living hosts. In fact, they serve four distinct purposes in nature: Essential oil constituents protect plants by attacking organisms that threaten the survival of the species. Essential oils defend plants by preventing animals or insects from eating them. The oil constituents are able to repel these pests because the scent is noxious or irritating to many animals. The unique fragrance of essential oils is thought to be inviting for a pollinating insect, even more so than color; therefore, essential oils are able to increase pollination. Essential oils prevent other plants from growing too close to the plant. This biological phenomenon is called allelopathy, which happens when plants produce biochemicals that influence the growth, survival and reproduction of organisms. 1. 2. 3. 4. Regardless of the amazing and varied functions they serve in a plant, essential oils must be extracted if we wish to use them. The methods of extraction depend on the plant material, the type of product to be liberated and the availability of equipment. The three basic methods of essential oil production are steam distillation, expression and extraction. FOUNDATIONSSteam distillation. Steam distillation is the most common method for producing essential oils today. The method for extracting essential oils was invented when Avicenna, an Arabian physician, added water to rose petals and distilled the mixture in the 10th century. The rose water he collected is considered to be the first modern perfume. Although Avicenna is credited with the invention, evidence of distillation occurring thousands of years earlier was found in Tape Gowra, Mesopotamia. It consisted of a pot, which held almost 40 liters, and a collecting ring that had a capacity of about 2 liters. This apparatus dates back to 3600 B.C. In steam distillation, plant material is exposed to steam, whose heat causes the essential oil to evaporate. Subsequent cooling of the hot vapors causes condensation of both water vapor and oil. Because the oil and water will not mix, they are easy to separate at that stage. Although the water is always separated from the essential oil during a steam distillation, it is often reserved (called a hydrosol) and used to add a pleasant fragrance to linen sprays, perfumes, moisturizers and hair and body products. See Figure 3.1 for an illustrated guide to steam distillation. 57 STEA M HEATHERBVAPORIZED OIL CONDENSIN G CHAMBE RCOLD WA TER ESSENTIAL OIL HYDROSOL Figure 3.1. The Steam Distillation Process. The most common method for extracting essential oils, steam distillation also produces hydrosol (a scented water also known as \"flower water\"). Expression. The expression process is used to obtain oils from citrus fruit, because the heat of distilling essential oils easily damages citrus oils. This technique is sometimes called cold-pressing because the oils are literally pressed out of the peel by hand or machine at ambient temperatures. A more modern method of cold-pressing extraction, which is less labor- intensive, has been termed the \"ecuelle a piquer process,\" where the fruit is placed in a device and rotated with spikes on the side puncturing the oil cells in the skin of the fruit. The puncturing of the rind will release the essential oil to be collected in a small area below the container. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) extraction. Oils extracted by the CO2 (carbon dioxide) method are commonly called CO2 extracts or supercritical fluid extractions. This method uses carbon dioxide to carry the essential oil away from the raw plant material. CO2 extracts are removed by pressurizing carbon dioxide until it becomes a liquid. The liquid carbon dioxide then acts as a solvent on the natural plant matter, and the essential oil content then dissolves into the liquid CO 2. Before being pressed through the plant, the carbon dioxide is then chilled, which causes the CO2 to evaporate back into its gaseous state\u2014and what is left is the resulting oil. Supercritical fluid extraction produces a pure and unaltered essential oil. Spicy-smelling oils like ginger and clove can be produced with carbon dioxide. Other oils produced via CO 2 extraction include turmeric, frankincense and myrrh. The CO2 supercritical extraction process eliminates the need for potentially harmful solvents like hexane that is often used in the manufacturing process of absolute oils, avoiding unnecessary environmental pollution and potential human bodily harm. It is a process that is growing in popularity as more and more essential oil companies embrace the concept of using CO 2 extracts. 58 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSThe answer to that is absolutely! You've heard the popular saying, \"Quality over quantity.\" This holds especially true when it comes to essential oils. Many people think that when they buy oil that is labeled \"100% pure,\" they are getting good oils. This is often far from true. Pure, unadulterated essential oil is more difficult to come by than many imagine, and it can be expensive. One reason for this is because it can take as many as 500 to 2,000 pounds or more of raw plant material to produce just a pound of essential oil. For example: \u00bb It takes 27 square feet of lavender plants to make one 15 mL bottle of lavender oil. \u00bb It takes 256 pounds of peppermint leaves to make 1 pound of peppermint oil. \u00bb It takes 75 lemons to make one 15 mL bottle of lemon oil. \u00bb It takes 60 roses to make a single drop of rose oil. No wonder quality oils are costly! Remember, in the Bible, it was said that a jar of nard (lavender) was worth a year's wages, and frankincense and myrrh were valued alongside gold. To be truly therapeutic, an essential oil must be free of chemicals and slowly and carefully extracted through methods that keep the original compounds in their natural state. The oils should also be bottled in dark glass containers to protect them from oxidation and sunlight, identified with their Latin name (to avoid confusion between the identification of some essential oils and their uses for therapeutic purposes), and tested to meet the standard of the species. When purchasing essential oils, you should always buy essential oils produced from organic ingredients whenever possible. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the origins, extraction process and quality of any essential oil you purchase. The only way to get a pure and high-quality essential oil is from oils that are unprocessed and sourced directly from nature, with nothing added. This allows the oils to remain rich and complex\u2014just as God created them.IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF OILS? 59 One of the most vital rules you must remember about essential oils is this: Not all essential oils are created equally. In fact, many are worthless to your health and can even be potentially toxic due to synthetic chemicals and other additives. Here is a quick guide to the four grades of essential oils available: Synthetic and altered oils. These oils are created in laboratories and are considered the lowest grade of oil. Although chemists have successfully recreated multiple chemical constituents of plants, those man-made constituents do not have the same healing properties as essential oils. Natural and \"pure\" oils. Although of better quality, these oils are overly processed, so they lose healing compounds. Natural oils are the most commonly sold type of essential oils. Just like the use of the word \"natural,\" there are many loopholes involved with the use of the word \"pure.\" It is possible for essential oils to be labeled as \"100% Pure\" or \"100% Natural,\" but not be the highest quality as one would hope or expect. For example, lavender oil is often cut with lavandin, which has very little therapeutic quality. Pure also does not mean it has no additional ingredients added to it. It could be 75 percent vegetable oil and 25 percent essential oil and still be labeled \"100% Pure.\" In the U.S., you are only required to have 5 percent essential oil in the bottle to label it \"Pure.\" Therapeutic-grade essential oils. These oils are said to have been steam- distilled and unadulterated, containing an array of beneficial compounds. However, therapeutic-grade is an unregulated term and is really defined by the company that produced them with no outside third-party validation. The only negative associated with therapeutic-grade essential oils is that they may come from plants and herbs that may have been grown with the use of chemical fertilizers and sprayed with pesticides. Certified organic essential oils. These are the highest grade of essential oils with the greatest healing properties. You can smell, feel and taste the difference between certified organic oils and those produced from HOW CAN I TELL I'M GETTING THE BEST OILS? 60 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSconventionally grown plants. Organic essential oils can cost between 2 to 4 times the price of their conventional counterparts, and some organic oils are in very short supply, which are the only real reasons an essential oil manufacturer would choose not to use organic oils. It is important to note that although \"therapeutic-grade\" essential oils are generally considered the safest oils, currently there is no regulatory standard for the descriptive use of the term \"therapeutic-grade,\" which means anyone can claim something is therapeutic-grade since there is no quality standard for authentication. Two organizations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Association French Normalization Organization Regulation (AFNOR), provide specifications as a guide to essential oil compositions. However, there is also no company or agency that officially certifies essential oils or their quality. Ethical companies who are committed to quality will use certain guidelines like those set by ISO and AFNOR as well as their own internal standards to make sure the oils they are creating will preserve the properties and integrity of the plant. In the labeling of essential oils, what you have are instances of ethical questions rather than legal ones, which may make it seem difficult to find the best oil. However, if you want to ensure the quality of the oil you use, there are several ways to assess an essential oil's potency and therapeutic quality: 1. Check to see if certain testing has been performed. It is ideal to purchase essential oils from a company or manufacturer who performs gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) testing. These testing techniques can analyze the constituents in oils. Gas chromatography (GC) is a technique that provides a fingerprint of the oil and can reveal additives. A mass spectrometer (MS) can measure the presence and quantity of chemical constituents that give essential oils their therapeutic benefits. GC/MS testing can detect if two or more oils with similar chemical composition have been mixed together, if an oil has had certain chemical constituents removed or if an oil has been rectified (made with lower quality plant parts). It will also reveal traces of solvents or mineral oils. 2. Know your Latin names. One of the simplest things you can do to be certain you are purchasing the right essential oil is to read the label. Many 61 plant names around the world also have similar common names but come in different varieties that can produce different results. If purchasing an unknown brand of essential oil, purchase by the Latin name, and always check for the correct botanical name. Lavender is a good example of the importance of Latin names. L. angustifolia, also referred to as \"true lavender,\" is the preferred lavender for clinical aromatherapy\u2014not lavandin (L. intermedia). True lavender has almost no camphor, whereas lavandin can have up to 40 percent. This matters because camphor is known to have a stimulating effect. Since lavender's reputation is primarily that of a sedative, if you purchase lavender using just the common name, you could end up with an oil that will keep you alert rather than relaxed. 3. Check the price tag. There is an awareness that a price that is very low comparatively may indicate that an oil is not sourced from the correct plant or part of the plant, or that it is diluted in a base oil or is otherwise adulterated. Generally, higher, premium priced oils designate superior quality. 4. Trust your nose. The smell, taste, feel and look of essential oils can provide important information about its quality and whether or not it should be used. In short, the more potent the fragrance, typically the more pure and powerful the oil. 62 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS\u00bb Is it from a reputable company that is known for its quality products?\u00bb Has the essential oil been tested or verified by a third party?\u00bb Is the essential oil certified organic or at the very least wild crafted?\u00bb Is the price of the oil in line with similar companies? If the price is significantly cheaper than oils from similar companies, it may not be a high-quality oil. \u00bb Does the label provide legitimate information, such as the plant's Latin name and common name? If you are new to the world of essential oils, it can seem overwhelming. Ask around and find the most trusted brands from friends and family who are seasoned essential oil users. A well-known reputation for producing high-quality oils will go far in the industry, but oils made by smaller distillers who use the proper techniques and test their oils for quality are excellent choices as well. Always remember to trust your instincts\u2014and your nose! 63 TIPS FOR PURCHASING HIGH-QUALITY OILS When purchasing essential oils, keep these questions in mind to ensure you are getting the best quality:CHAPTER 4 ESSENTIAL OILS CHEMISTRY 101Many of today's synthetic drugs carry potentially serious side effects. The Nutrition Institute of America funded an independent review of \"government-approved medicine\" that was published in 2006. Professors Gary Null and Dorothy Smith, along with doctors Carolyn Dean, Martin Feldman and Debora Rasio titled the report, \"Death by Medicine.\" 10 The researchers found that America's leading cause of death isn't heart disease or cancer: it's conventional medicine. Over the course of a decade, the scientists predict that iatrogenic deaths will total about 7.8 million, \"more than all the casualties from all the wars fought by the U.S. throughout its entire history,\" a death rate equivalent to that caused by six jumbo jets falling out of the sky every day. What that means is we are spending billions of dollars every year on conventional treatments that are killing us at a faster rate than the ailments for which we are being treated. Essential oils, on the other hand, represent a gentle, supportive approach to healing. Because of their chemical structure, they're metabolized in the cells like other nutrients. Essential oils are volatile and therefore evaporate quickly. So, unlike many synthetic drugs, they don't accumulate in the body. The remarkable qualities of essential oil chemistry make using oils a safe and natural alternative for healing the body. When Dr. Josh's mom was diagnosed with cancer for the second time, frightening statistics about iatrogenic death rates were not widely available; yet his family felt strongly that she would soon become a statistic if they followed the conventional path to cancer treatment again. That is when she started following an all-natural plan that included vegetable juicing, probiotic foods, immune-boosting supplements, stress-reducing techniques, prayer and essential oils. After only four months, the tumors on her lungs had shrunk significantly and one year after that, she was again diagnosed as being \"cancer-free\" and healthy. Ten years later, she is in her mid-60s and in the best shape of her life, regularly water skiing, running and still going strong. We want to be clear\u2014we are not claiming that what Dr. Josh's mother did is a proven cancer treatment. We're also not attributing her results solely to the use of essential oils, as they played a supportive role in her recovery. But we believe natural therapies, either used by themselves or in conjunction 66 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS67 with conventional medical treatments, may support the body in the healing process. Dr. Josh is often asked, \"What exactly did your mom do?\" Among other regimented therapy plans, one of the things she used was essential oils, such as frankincense, myrrh, lavender and oregano oil. Frankincense essential oil is one of the most effective natural cancer fighters and is now the subject of numerous research trials. Specifically, Indian Frankincense (Boswellia serrata) has been shown clinically to be an adjunctive remedy for various forms of cancer. 11,12,13,14,15 According to researchers out of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, the potential cancer-fighting effects of frankincense are due to its chemistry\u2014components in frankincense give it the ability to influence your genes to promote healing. In each of our families, essential oils are a natural, first choice for supplementation. The reason for our confidence in them is based on their rich history of use, the thousands of articles and studies proving their effectiveness and, ultimately, the chemistry of essential oils, from which their distinct abilities are derived. Essential oil chemistry reveals an elegance that is nothing short of astounding. Learning about their complex nature provides greater insight into how essential oils can affect your health. Essential oils have been called the \"lifeblood\" of a plant. They circulate through plant tissues and pass through cell walls, carrying nutrition into cells and carrying waste products out. Because the chemistry of pure essential oils retains the healing intent of the plants from which they originated, they manifest an ability to organize and balance our energies as well. If our bodies are out of balance and experiencing illness or CHEMISTRY DEMYSTIFIED dysfunction, the oils serve to restore order and balance (or homeostasis) to our various systems. Research has found that people who consistently use essential oils have a higher level of resistance to illnesses, colds, flus and diseases than the average person. Further indications show that after contracting a cold, flu or other illness, these individuals will recover 60 to 70 percent faster than those who do not use essential oils. There are two main groups of essential oil constituents that define the chemistry of essential oils: 1) hydrocarbons and 2) oxygenated compounds, and both types are further divided into subgroups. Oils contain multiple constituents, which is why they have so many varied properties and uses. For example, a major component of frankincense oil (40 percent of its composition) is alpha-pinene, which is a monoterpene hydrocarbon. That enables frankincense to take on the therapeutic qualities of monoterpenes. Frankincense also contains 98 other constituents\u2014and the end result is an essential oil that has innumerable value and uses. In the remainder of the chapter, we will briefly look at each chemical compound subgroup in order to highlight each constituent's therapeutic benefits, as well as which oils contain large percentages of each. Hydrocarbons Monoterpenes is a chemical family made up of components that are considered \"top notes,\" as they are the first aromas to hit your nose in a blend. Monoterpenes are found in almost all essential oils in some percentage. Essential oils with more than 60 percent monoterpenes include frankincense, grapefruit, cypress, lemon, juniper berry and sweet orange. Here are some of the therapeutic qualities of monoterpenes: \u00bb Analgesic\u00bb Anti-bacterial\u00bb Antiseptic\u00bb kill airborne germs\u00bb Expectorant\u00bb Great for getting deep into sore muscles, tendons and ligaments\u00bb Rubifacient (increases circulation) 68 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS69 Sesquiterpenes are present in almost all essential oils. Research from the Universities of Berlin and Vienna show increased oxygenation around the pineal and pituitary glands with the introduction of sesquiterpenes. Further research has shown that sesquiterpenes have the ability to surpass the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain tissue. 16,17 Although they are difficult to generalize, here are some therapeutic qualities and examples excellent therapeutic properties because they are stimulating to the nervous and immune systems. They are an excellent choice for combating an aggressive infection. Examples of oils containing high amounts of phenols are wintergreen, oregano, clove and tea tree. Here are some of the therapeutic qualities of phenols: \u00bb Anti-bacterial\u00bb Antiseptic\u00bb alcohols. Sesquiterpene alcohols are not commonly found in large quantities in essential oils, but when found (like bisabolol in German chamomile), they have great properties, which include liver and glandular stimulant, anti-allergen and anti-inflammatory. Other oils that contain sesquiterpene alcohols are ginger, patchouli, vetiver, carrot seed and valerian. Monoterpene alcohols have very few known side effects and have an uplifting, energizing effect. High levels of monoterpenes alcohols are found in lavender, rose, geranium, juniper and tea tree oil. They also most relaxing, calming and balancing of all the essential oil constituents. They regulate the nervous system and are anti-spasmodic. Some of the essential oils with the highest percentages of esters are Roman chamomile, jasmine absolute and helichrysum. Here are some of the other therapeutic \u00bb Analgesic\u00bb Anti-inflammatory\u00bb Sedative\u00bb Soothing\u00bb Stress-reducing Aldehydes are calming to the nervous system. They are best known to relieve stress and promote relaxation. Aldehydes can be quite irritating when applied topically, but may have a profound calming effect when inhaled. Cinnamon bark and lemongrass contain high amounts of aldehydes, which have the fragrances and are calming and sedative. They also stimulate cell regeneration, promote new tissue growth and liquefy mucus, making them ideal for respiratory issues. Peppermint has more ketones than most other essential oils, although rosemary, vetiver and spike lavender have effective amounts as well. Ketones also generally provide the following benefits: \u00bb Analgesic\u00bb FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSOxides are expectorants that can be mildly stimulating. 1,8-cineole or eucalyptol is the most prevalent member of the oxide family, and it is wonderful for respiratory issues. Eucalyptus, ravensara and rosemary contain high amounts of oxides. Other therapeutic properties of oxides include: \u00bb Anti-bacterial\u00bb Anti-fungal\u00bb Anti-viral\u00bb Can stimulate blood flow to the brain when inhaled If you're interested in the therapeutic use of essential oils, some knowledge of their chemistry can be highly useful. Not only will you better understand how and why essential oils work, but the great importance of using natural, high-quality oils will also be made clear. Essential oils have different chemical make-ups than other oils, and the differences can significantly affect the healing potency of topical, inhaled and oral applications for you and your family. In the next chapter, you will learn more about the potency of oils and how to use them safely and effectively in a variety of applications. 71 THE CHEMISTRY OF ESSENTIAL OILSCHAPTER 5 USING ESSENTIAL OILS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY Everyone has a different \"essential oil style.\" Some people use essential oils as natural remedies while others use them to fragrance the air. Some use them to replace toxic personal care products. Finally, other people use essential oils for everything\u2014it becomes part of their cleaning products, shampoo, toothpaste, detergent, deodorant and used as first aid remedies. The three of us have our own essential own styles that are unique to our families. Jordan has seen his life transformed by the use of essential oils every day. His essential oil style might be called \"ancient healing.\" As he anoints his family with oils each morning, he is reminded of the wondrous power within the oils as he thanks the Great Physician who created them. Ty's essential oil style is one of \"soothing air.\" He prefers to diffuse his oils because he believes that is the best way for his entire family to experience the immune boosting, restorative, energizing abilities of essential oils each and every day. Dr. Josh enjoys finding new ways to use essential oils. His essential oil style is \"infinite possibilities\" because he and his wife use it to clean their air, care for their dogs, improve their sleep, stop headaches, improve concentration and countless other uses. What's your essential oil style? Everybody has one\u2014even those who are just beginning to explore the world of essential oils. The good news is that there are so many oils and so many ways to use them that the options for use are virtually limitless. There are, however, a finite number of ways essential oils may be used when it comes to our bodies. The ways in which they are used are dependent upon the needs or desired outcome of the individual using the oil. This chapter will describe the three main methods of essential oil use: 1) aromatherapy applications (direct inhalation and diffusing), 2) topical use and 3) internal use. 74 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSThe aromatic nature of essential oils stimulates powerful mental, emotional and physiologic responses. Not only does the aroma of the natural essential oil stimulate the brain to trigger a reaction, but also when inhaled into the lungs, the naturally occurring chemicals can supply therapeutic benefits. For example, diffusing eucalyptus essential oil is an effective way to help ease congestion. When a person simply breathes in the aroma of an essential oil, this is called direct inhalation. Here are some methods of direct inhalation: \u00bb Open an essential oil bottle and breathe in the aroma. \u00bb Place a drop or two of oil or a blend of oils in the hands, rub them together, make a cup around the nose and mouth and breathe in. (Note: Use caution when practicing this method. Some essential oils require prior mixing with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, to dilute the concentration and prevent skin irritation.)\u00bb Place a drop or two of oil or a blend of oils on a piece of cloth or tissue, hold it close to the face and inhale. Another popular method of aromatherapy is diffusing essential oils into a room. When using a diffuser, the essential oil is evaporated into the surrounding environment. Diffusing essential oils can alter your mood by relaxing or stimulating the mind. It can also kill airborne pathogens and treat a respiratory condition. Here are some ways to diffuse essential oils: \u00bb To clean the air, add a blend of lemon, clove, orange, cinnamon, eucalyptus and rosemary oils to a diffuser.\u00bb To improve energy, add peppermint to a diffuser.\u00bb To reduce stress or combat a headache, or just to relax, add lavender to a diffuser.THE FRAGRANT WORLD OF AROMATHERAPY 75 There are four main types of diffusers: Atomizing: No water is involved when using atomizing diffusers\u2014the essential oil bottle is connected to the diffuser to create a pure vapor that is extremely powerful and therapeutic. Vaporizing: These diffusers use water with the essential oil; ultrasonic waves are used to emit the oil and water particles into the air. Vaporizing diffusers are very quiet, so they are popular with therapists, yoga instructors and other professionals who are looking to achieve a peaceful environment. Fan or evaporative: Evaporative diffusers are usually lower in cost and used in a smaller area. A fan blows air from the room through a pad or filter that has essential oils on it. The air blowing through the pad causes the oils to evaporate more quickly than with other diffusers, and the air with the evaporated oil is blown into the room. Heat: Like evaporative diffusers, heat diffusers also cause the essential oils to evaporate quickly; these diffusers use heat instead of blowing air to accomplish diffusion.1. 2. 3. 4. Another way to diffuse a room with essential oils is by using a spray bottle. Oils can be mixed with water or alcohol and then sprayed in the air, on surfaces or on the body. This will create a refreshing and energizing environment. 76 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSWhen essential oils are applied directly to the skin, they are absorbed and enter the bloodstream (this is because the oils are fat-soluble). When an oil is applied to the skin with no carrier oil, this is called a \"neat\" application. The soles of the feet is one area of the body that is sometimes exposed to a neat application. It is also one of the most popular places to apply oils. There are several reasons for this: Less irritation. When oils are administered on the soles of the feet, there is a lower risk of skin irritation. The skin there is less sensitive than the skin on the rest of the body. No sebum. The soles of the feet and the palms of the hands are the only sites on our body without sebaceous glands. Sebum is an oily substance that helps lubricate and waterproof the skin. Since the palms and the soles do not secrete sebum, they are more ready to absorb oil. Bypass the liver. When you apply oils to the soles of the feet, the oils bypass the liver and will not accumulate there. Instead of being processed by the liver, the oils reach the lower bronchial capillaries via the circulatory system and the entire organism unprocessed. Other key points of application on the body include behind the ears, neck, abdomen, upper back, temples and along the spine. When applying essential oils, sensitive skin areas should be avoided, such as the eyes, inner ears, genitals and open skin. Essential oils are commonly combined with a carrier oil, which not only dilutes the essential oil but also prevents easy evaporation. Because using a carrier oil dilutes the potency of the essential oil being used, the chances of experiencing an irritation or skin reaction are reduced. Some of the best carrier oils include coconut oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, olive oil, almond oil, pomegranate seed oil and avocado oil: Coconut oil\u2014The best all-purpose oil to use in personal care products, from making homemade body care products like lotion, deodorant and toothpaste to diluting for topical use. When used topically, fractionated coconut oil works best due to its liquid state at room temperature. LET'S GET TOPICAL 77 Jojoba oil\u2014Ideal for both very dry and oily skin to help bring balance back. Use it with geranium, lavender and tea tree for tough skin conditions. Magnesium oil\u2014Known as the ultimate relaxer. Blend it with Roman chamomile and lavender to reduce stress and improve sleep. Arnica oil\u2014Best for treating bruises, pain and skin inflammation. Shea butter\u2014The best carrier oil for moisturizing very dry and aged skin. It's also great for making a homemade body butter recipe. Argan oil\u2014Known to firm and tighten skin, which is great for anti-aging effects. Mix it with frankincense, myrrh and geranium to improve skin tone. It's also packed with vitamin E. Evening primrose oil\u2014Great for hormone balance because it contains high levels of GLA (gamma linoleic acid), which produces hormone-regulating prostaglandin. Mix it with clary sage, thyme and ylang ylang to support healthy hormones. There are many other beneficial carrier oils such as olive, rosehip, hemp, sea buckthorn, black cumin, almond, apricot and pomegranate. For a more complete list of carrier oils, including their key benefits, please refer to Part II, which details individual essential and carrier oils. When determining an appropriate topical dose, age and size are the biggest factors. The younger and smaller the person, the less essential oil is needed. It is safest to start with a small amount and repeat the application 20 minutes later if necessary. In most cases, essential oils should be diluted with a carrier oil for use on the skin. Topical Use Recommendations The appropriate dosage for topical use of essential oils is different for each oil and individual\u2014taking into consideration the individual's personal circumstances and health conditions. 78 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONS79 A generalized suggested ratio for dilution with a carrier oil is as follows: FOR INFANTS 1 drop of essential oil to 1 tablespoon carrier oil+ FOR CHILDREN 1 to 2 drops of essential oil to 1 teaspoon carrier oil+ FOR ADULTS 3 to 6 drops of essential oil to 1 teaspoon carrier oil+ Once the essential oils are mixed with the carrier oil, rub the oils together in the palm with your fingers and apply the mixture to the specific area in circular, light massage movements. 79 Baths. Adding oils to bath water is a mix of aromatic and topical applications. In order to disperse the oil throughout the bath water, add 5 to 15 drops of essential oils to bath salts or Epsom salts, which will dissolve in the water. This can help improve circulation, relieve sore muscles, soothe skin, open airways, relax the body and improve sleep. Soothing oils like eucalyptus and lavender are especially beneficial when added to an aromatherapy bath. Compresses. Using a warm compress will increase the absorption of essential oils. Add 10 drops of oil per 4 ounces of water. Soak the cloth with the oil and water mixture and apply it to bruises, infections, aches and pains. (Peppermint is one of the best oils for muscle aches, while lavender is great for treating infections.) Salves. A salve is an ointment that is used to soothe the surface of the body. You can make salves by adding 15 drops of essential oils to 1 ounce of a carrier oil (2.5 percent dilution). Salves can be stored in a metal or glass container and used on cuts, scrapes and sore muscles. Personal Care. Essential oils can be used in common home remedies like homemade toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, perfume, cologne, lip balm and body lotion. To make homemade teeth- and gum-supporting toothpaste, mix \u00bc cup coconut oil, 3 tablespoons bentonite clay and 10 drops of peppermint or clove essential oil together and put the mixture into a rubber tube or sealed glass container. 80 | FOUNDATIONSHere are some other ways to use essential oils topically: FOUNDATIONS81 Essential oils are more potent than whole plant material. Remember that a single drop of rose oil contains the chemical constituents present in 60 roses. That is why when essential oils are used internally, it should be in small amounts only. However, research does show that many oils can be safe and effective when taken orally, so it may be worth the necessary preparation and caution for certain conditions and for short periods of time. When an essential oil is consumed in high doses, it can result in overuse or toxicity. That is because essential oils are fat-soluble, meaning they are not easily eliminated from the body and must travel through the liver and then the gut. To avoid ingesting toxic concentrations of essential oils, labels should be read carefully and professional guidelines should be followed. When we get the question, \"Are essential oils safe to use internally?\" our answer is always, \"It depends upon which oil and the person taking the oil.\" There is a sub-population of therapists who believe that essential oils should not be taken internally unless recommended by a physician. They recommend only topical or aromatic use. It's important to remember that a large amount of published articles and studies have demonstrated that many essential oils provide tremendous benefits when used internally, and traditional practitioners of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine have used essential oils therapeutically for thousands of years. It's all about using wisdom, applying common sense and remembering that following product usage directions is key in all supplement use\u2014and when in doubt, use the oil topically. The three of us have personally used essential oils for ourselves and our families, clients and patients. Some oils, like peppermint and lemon oil, can be consumed in small doses at 1 to 2 drops, two to three times a day. Other oils like oregano should only be consumed for a maximum of 10 days and under the guidance of a health care professional. Wintergreen should only be used topically or aromatically (diffused) and should never be used internally. People with liver disease and those who have higher levels of sensitivities need to be cautious. All essential oils should be taken with food or a beverage and not on an empty stomach.TAKING ESSENTIAL OILS INTERNALLY82 | FOUNDATIONS Put several drops of oil into an empty capsule and swallow with waterAdd 1 to 2 drops to a glass of water, almond milk or coconut milk Add 1 to 2 drops to 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and then consumeAdd 1 to 2 drops to 1 teaspoon of raw honey and then consume Drop certain oils directly under the tongueSuggested internal use methods for adults include: FOUNDATIONS83 If you're someone who purchases and consumes organic foods, you should do your best to consume essential oil products that are certified organic. When it comes to using oils on your body (topically) or taking them internally, safety is based on the properties of the oil itself, not the \"quality\" of the brand. Some oils are simply not safe to take internally. It is not wise to believe a company statement that asserts, \"All of our oils are safe for internal use.\" A bottle label may say \"safe for supplemental use,\" but even then that doesn't necessarily mean it is safe when taken internally. Some oils that are not safe for ingestion include oils from the needles of trees such as pine essential oil and some bark oils such as cypress. Some essential oils are only suitable for external use because they have been linked to liver toxicity. These oils include aniseed, bay and tarragon. Always consult with a doctor or healthcare practitioner before using essential oils internally. When in doubt, remember that with most essential oils, benefits can be found from topical and aromatherapy use.A scientific review published by the U.S National Library of Medicine in 2014 states that safety testing on essential oils shows very few negative side effects or risks when they are used as directed. Some essential oils have been approved as ingredients in food and are classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, within specific limits. However, like all medicine, they are not without their risks and possible complications. It takes a small amount of essential oils to prompt a powerful therapeutic benefit. Because essential oils are so concentrated, they must be used with care. Labels should be read carefully and guidelines followed vigilantly. Essential oils should never be applied to the eyes or ear canals. After handling essential oils, avoid accidental eye contact by washing your hands. If essential oils get into the eye, place a few drops of a carrier oil in the eye and blink until the oil clears out. If you are taking prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, be aware that using an essential oil along with a drug can increase the drug's side effects. The chemical constituents of the essential oil could inhibit the drug's metabolizing enzymes, rendering the drug unable to be excreted or metabolized properly. Grapefruit essential oil specifically has been shown to interfere with medications. Before using essential oils, research the oil's drug interactions or speak to a health care provider about possible outcomes. For example, people who are taking heart medications, such as blood thinners, should avoid using clary sage, cypress, eucalyptus, ginger, rosemary, sage and thyme oils. The International Fragrance Association has banned several essential oils because they are toxic when ingested or applied topically. These oils include cade oil southernwood, RESPECT THEIR EFFECTS AND INTERACTIONS 84 | FOUNDATIONSFOUNDATIONSstinging nettle, stryax gum, tea absolute, wormseed and wormwood. Allergic reactions and skin irritation may occur, especially when essential oils are in contact with the skin for long periods of time. In fact, sun sensitivity may develop when citrus or other oils are applied to the skin before sun exposure. Finally, lavender and tea tree oils have been found to have hormone-like effects similar to estrogen. On the other hand, many studies, including one published in Evidence Based Complementary Alternative Medicine concludes that lavender oil effectively relieves stress, anxiety, depression, neurological conditions and cognitive conditions. 18 Lavender oil and tea tree oil are known to reduce pain and work as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Some essential oils that are better for regulating hormone levels include Roman chamomile, sandalwood and clary sage. Keep in mind that essential oils are highly concentrated substances. One drop is powerful enough to soothe sore muscles, relieve an itchy bug bite or stop a cold in its tracks. Don't be fooled by their \"natural\" origin. Their power must be respected\u2014they have the potential to cause minor reactions, such as skin irritation, or more serious consequences like respiratory failure, when not used appropriately. Before experimenting with an oil, become familiar with its properties, dosage instructions and precautions. When in doubt about a condition or an oil, consult a qualified medical specialist. There is no regulated standard, which means it is up to users to educate themselves on the proper use of each essential oil before using them. 85 PART II SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS AND CARRIER OILSEssential oils are so much more than just extraordinary aromas\u2014each one features a vast array of uses and benefits. Every essential oil contains compounds that possess unique therapeutic benefits. In the pages that follow, we will explore the rich history of many different oils, while examining their aromas and most prevalent therapeutic qualities. EACH OIL PROFILE CONTAINS: Description: A brief account of the oil's history and its most common uses from antiquity to modern times Research: A summary of research studies demonstrating the therapeutic properties of its primary chemical constituents Key Benefits: A list of the major benefits associated with the oil's chemistry Therapeutic Compounds: Highlights of the oil's important nutrients and beneficial compounds Safety: Unique safety considerations for the oil Super 7 Rx Uses: Seven uses and practical applications for the oil NOTE: Throughout this section, we have provided you with suggested uses for each oil. Here are the guidelines for use: Aromatherapy Use. Place 5 to 7 drops of the desired oil in a diffuser with fresh, filtered water. Topical Use. Apply 2 to 4 drops to the affected area. Refer to cautions about which oils are \"hot\" oils. For sensitive skin, always mix the essential oil with a carrier oil. Internal Use. Place 1 to 3 drops in a beverage, on a spoonful of honey or coconut oil or under the tongue. See the specific guidelines for each oil for more information. 88 | SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS89 We have also included our own personal favorite uses for particular oils to provide even more examples of how they can be used. For example, Dr. Josh relates how he and his wife use myrrh, Ty talks about how he uses lemon oil and Jordan discusses his use of frankincense oil. You can use each essential oil by itself and/or gain enhanced therapeutic benefits by blending oils together. One option is to combine essential oils with a carrier oil and use this mixture in the place of potentially toxic personal care products (see The Role of Carrier Oils). In some cases, simply adding a few drops of essential oil to an existing product will greatly enrich its benefits. (For more on the art of blending oils, refer to the introduction in Part V: Essential Oil Recipes.) Our hope is that you feel inspired to utilize essential oils in new and unexpected ways to provide healthy alternatives to many chemically-created products available today. The Role of Carrier Oils Carrier oils serve a key role in delivering essential oils both topically and internally. The most common carrier oil for everyday use is coconut oil, which is often fractionated (meaning it's liquid at room temperature), but there are other options that can provide you with additional advantages. For more carrier oil options, as well as information on their key benefits, see the list of carrier oils at the end of Part II. 89 GENERAL SAFETY AND COMMON SENSE GUIDELINES When it comes to essential oils, a little goes a long way. Start with one to two drops and assess your tolerance and desired results before increasing amount. Many oils can be applied NEAT (undiluted, or without a carrier oil), but check each oil first to ensure it is safe to do so. When in doubt, dilute. Stop use immediately if irritation occurs. Some oils are not safe to take internally. Check the warnings for each oil before ingesting and only consume essential oils that are certified organic and labeled as dietary supplements. Some essential oils are not safe to use while pregnant. Check the warnings for each oil before use during pregnancy. If you are prone to mouth or throat irritation, put essential oils into a capsule or dilute it with a carrier oil or food (honey, applesauce, etc.) before swallowing. When adding essential oils to food or liquid, start with one drop and taste before adding more. Most essential oils should be taken with food and not on an empty stomach. Talk to your healthcare practitioner before using essential oils if you are taking any prescription medications, as some oils may have interactions when taken along with certain drugs. Do not use essential oils in the eyes or in the ear canals. Only use certified organic oils to ensure highest quality and purity\u2014and to ensure safety for use on or in important safety recommendations that apply to the use of all essential oils. Read this list carefully\u2014and then go enjoy your oils! 90 | SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS91 BASIL OCIMUM BASILICUM An ancient herb found in Egyptian pyramids, the kings of old were often anointed with basil in special ceremonies. In Asia, basil is commonly used to counter venomous poisons from snakes and insects. In India, basil is sacred; it is planted around temples and graves. It is also used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine to treat colds, flu, fever, muscle aches and earaches. Centuries ago, basil was considered to have an alluring scent; Italian women wore the oil and even set pots of basil outside their windows to attract possible suitors. Basil essential oil, sometimes called \"sweet basil oil,\" has a naturally sweet, warm, spicy and herbal smell and is derived from the Ocimum basilicum plant through steam distillation. You probably know basil to be an herb that is used to enhance the flavor of many recipes. However, its uses today extend far beyond the culinary world. Basil essential oil is used to treat various wounds and infections, and it often serves as a calming agent to combat inflammation, help reduce adrenal fatigue and treat nerve and muscle conditions. 92 | SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILSRESEARCH STUDIES A study found that basil oil, along with other plant oils, including fennel, demonstrates inhibitory properties against powerful strains of bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteriditis.1 According to a 2014 review, basil oil has been effectively used as a traditional medicinal plant for the treatment of headaches, coughs, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, kidney malfunctions and more. 2 KEY BENEFITS Contains anti-bacterial properties Reduces inflammation Combats free radical damage Helps relieve congestion May increase urine output Stimulates the nervous system May balance adrenal hormones Serves as an aid for ear infections THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS SAFETY Do not use during pregnancy.

Birch essential oil is identical in chemical constituents to wintergreen essential oil, which is why the American Indians and early European settlers added both birch bark and wintergreen to tea in order to benefit from their warming and stimulating properties. The Native Americans took birch for various health conditions associated with the stomach, including dysentery, diarrhea and indigestion. Birch oil has a minty and earthy aroma that relieves muscle pain and increases awareness in the sensory system. The wood of the birch tree is steam-distilled to extract the essential oils. Its active ingredients (salicylic acid and methyl salicylate) make this minty, versatile oil an excellent choice for supporting skin health.

References to pepper appear in Greek and Roman texts, suggesting an ancient trade between India and the West. The Romans loved adding pepper to their food; in fact, in the oldest known cookbook in existence, 80 percent of the recipes contain the spice. Signs of an ancient pepper trade from India to Egypt have also been found, including peppercorns that had been stuffed into the nostrils of Ramses the Great when he was mummified. Derived from the fruit, black pepper essential oil is extracted through steam distillation. The essential oil has a spicy, warm, peppery and musky aroma. It is commonly used to aid the digestive and nervous systems\u2014stimulating circulation and promoting emotional balance. Black pepper possesses a unique versatility that is both energizing and warming. In addition to invigorating the senses, black pepper can be used to enhance mental clarity. It is a favorite among athletes and those with an active lifestyle. 101 RESEARCH STUDIES A 1994 study found that black pepper oil can suppress certain smoking withdrawal symptoms, including cravings for cigarettes. Cigarette smokers reported that cigarette cravings were significantly reduced and feelings of anxiety were alleviated.11 When patients applied a cream composed of black pepper, marjoram, lavender and peppermint essential oils to the neck daily for a four-week period, the group reported improved pain tolerance and significant improvement of neck pain. 12 KEY BENEFITS Enhances food flavor May aid digestion Encourages circulation Helps increase energy May help relieve cramps and spasms Helps relieve respiratory conditions Helps soothe feelings of anxiety Contains anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic properties THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS SAFETY Dilution is recommend for topical use.

Egyptians imported cassia from China and used it in the embalming process. In the ancient Middle East, people so valued cassia that it was worth its weight in gold or ivory. Cassia is mentioned in the Bible several times and was often used in anointing oils. The root word, kiddah, in both Hebrew and Arabic, signifies a \"strip\" and refers to the strips of bark from which the spice is made. In the spiritual sense, cassia speaks of devotion (being stripped of pride) and consecration (set apart) with a servant's heart. The Israelites may have brought it with them when they left Egypt for the Promised Land. As the Israelites traveled throughout the Sinai Peninsula, they may have purchased cassia from traders who crossed the Peninsula from Arabia to Egypt. Cassia essential oil is derived by steam distillation of the plant's bark, leaves and twigs. It has a spicy, warm aroma\u2014similar to cinnamon but sweeter. It has been traditionally used in the treatment of leprosy, erysipelas, ulcer symptoms, cough, flatulence, dyspepsia, menstrual problems and tuberculosis. Cassia oil is often used as a supportive aid for bronchitis, anemia and constipation. 107 RESEARCH STUDIES A 2016 study found that a chemical constituent present in cassia showed a preventive effect for the formation of atherosclerotic plaque (the plaque that builds up in your arteries).16 A study found that both cassia oil and pure cinnamaldehyde (the organic compound that gives cassia its flavor and odor) were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates of bacteria, including four species of candida, and molds.17 KEY BENEFITS Inhibits the growth of bacteria Works as an astringent Serves as a natural bug repellant Balances blood sugar Can improve circulation Alleviates menstrual symptoms Works as an anti-depressant Supports the immune system THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS SAFETY Use it internally in small doses only (1 to 2 drops).

The wood and its oil were used in embalming by the Ancient Egyptians. Cedrus atlantica is closely related to the Biblical Cedar of Lebanon. An enormous grove of cedars of Lebanon\u2014from which King Solomon is said to have built his temple\u2014exists still on the slopes of Mount Lebanon. Cedarwood essential oil is comforting, reassuring and possesses a woodsy, pleasant scent. The oil is extracted through the process of steam distillation from wood pieces of the cedar wood tree, and it adds a warm tone to any blend of perfumes, colognes or oil mixtures. Cedarwood has the power to improve the look of your skin, help with organ function, tighten muscles, support metabolism and benefit your digestive system. It's no wonder why cedars were the trees mentioned most in the Bible, symbolizing a source of protection, wisdom and abundance. 110 | SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILS When I'm writing a book or recording an interview, I love to diffuse cedarwood, rosemary and peppermint to support creativity, memory and energy. - Dr. Josh SINGLE ESSENTIAL OILSRESEARCH STUDIES One study found that cedarwood essential oil is a viable alternative to other anti-bacterial agents and is an effective module in controlling both bacteria and yeasts responsible for oral infections.19 A study found that using cedarwood oil on children could greatly improve their focus and learning capacity.

Unlike essential oils, carrier oils do not evaporate easily and do not give off strong aromas. Unfortunately, carrier oils often have a defined shelf life and will become rancid over time. Each carrier oil offers a different combination of nourishing properties, benefits and characteristics. Some are more aromatic than others, and the color and shelf life will differ as well. The following pages will provide you with some of the most widely used carrier oils that can be combined with essential oils in aromatherapy.POMEGRANATE Pomegranate seed oil is considered one of the Bible's powerful foods because of its powerful anti-aging benefits. The dark red color in pomegranate seed oil comes from the bioflavonoids, which protect the skin from sun damage. It has a natural sun protection factor (SPF) and can be used as a sunblock and sunscreen. Key Benefits \u00bb Contains powerful antioxidants\u00bb Helps reduce inflammation\u00bb Works as a natural sunblock\u00bb Boosts skin cell regenerationAroma Odorless 249 ROSEHIP Rosehip oil is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile. It contains powerful antioxidants, vitamins and essential fatty acids\u2014making it an effective carrier oil for hydrating the skin, relieving itchiness and minimizing the appearances of dark spots, scars and fine lines. Rosehip absorbs easily, and it is non-greasy and light when applied topically. Key Benefits \u00bb Stimulates collagen production\u00bb Moisturizes skin and hair\u00bb Can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines\u00bb Protects skin from UV rays and sun damage\u00bb Has anti-aging propertiesAroma Mild and earthySEA BUCKTHORN Sea buckthorn berries and seeds are cold-pressed and CO2 extracted for their oils, which are rich in essential fatty acids and contain vitamins, minerals and nutritive compounds. Sea buckthorn oil is used on the skin to reduce the signs of aging. Because of its intense color that can stain skin when used in high doses, a 1:3 dilution is recommended. Key Benefits \u00bb Promotes skin regeneration\u00bb Boosts skin elasticity\u00bb Helps treat and acne\u00bb May reduce inflammation\u00bb Soothes the digestive tractAroma Musky 250 SHEA BUTTER Shea butter is not a carrier oil, but its natural, beneficial properties make it a lipid suitable for aromatherapy work. It is highly moisturizing, has a smooth, creamy texture and can be included in massage blends, lotions, creams and other natural skin care products. Shea butter can become gritty if not melted and then cooled properly. Once it has cooled, it does not need to be kept in the refrigerator. Key Benefits \u00bb Moisturizes skin\u00bb Helps reduce inflammation\u00bb Can improve skin elasticity\u00bb Contains mild SPF properties\u00bb Serves as an under eye wrinkle and bag reducerAroma Nutty and fatty CARRIER OILS251 When shopping for carrier oils, quality matters just as much as it does when it comes to essential oils. For example, you should use only raw, unrefined, grade A shea butter. There are many refined shea butters that are odor-free and bleached to be completely white, but the refining process removes some of the beneficial properties. Similarly, the only coconut oil recommended for use as a carrier oil is raw, unrefined, virgin, organic coconut oil. WHAT ABOUT MINERAL OIL? Mineral oil and petroleum jelly are byproducts of petroleum production. They are not of natural, botanical origin and are not used within the scope of holistic therapy. Mineral oil is used in baby oils and many commercially available moisturizers because it is an inexpensive oil to manufacture. It can, however, clog pores, prevent the skin from breathing naturally, prevent essential oil absorption, prevent toxins from leaving the body through the natural process of sweating and may even block vitamins from properly being utilized. As you continue growing your collection of essential oils, experiment with different carrier oils; they have so many uses as both carriers and in DIY recipes. Find the ones that work best for you to get the most out of your essential oils' therapeutic qualities. PART III CONDITIONSWe believe essential oils have the power to change the way you feel. While they are not cure-alls, the use of essential oils through aromatherapy, topical application and internal consumption has a variety of health benefits, providing you with non-invasive home remedies for a multitude of conditions. Even better, they can be used safely in combination with many other therapies. Some traditional hospitals are catching on to the benefits of essential oils and are using them to aid patients who are being treated for conditions such as anxiety, depression and infections. A 2009 study found that pre-operative patients who received aromatherapy with lavandin oil were significantly less anxious about their surgery than those in the control group. Other oils such as sandalwood, neroli oil and lavender oil have also been used in traditional medicine to help patients better manage anxiety. 1 Additionally, essential oils have been shown to help patients better manage pain. A 2007 study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that women who used aromatherapy during labor reported less pain overall and were able to use fewer pain medications. 2 Essential oils can also have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal benefits. When key oils are massaged into the skin, they can promote healing and fight harmful bacteria. Others may help boost the immune system, reduce symptoms of insomnia and aid with digestion. The power of essential oils rests in their chemical compounds\u2014and in this section, we have detailed the most common conditions from which Americans suffer. For each, we provide you with: Background: A brief summary of the condition. Essential Oils: The most effective essential oils for that condition.Research: Documented research and clinical studies for key uses. Home Remedy: A DIY remedy to help improve symptoms and promote natural healing. Suggested Supplements: Two to three recommended supplements to help round out a wellness protocol. 254 | CONDITIONS CONDITIONSFor each oil, we recommend referring to its single oil page in Part II for recommended applications and safety guidelines. If you are taking any prescription medications, please consult with your healthcare practitioner before use. We hope you will use this section often as a reference guide in your quest for better health and a cleaner lifestyle that most closely resembles the way God intended for us to nourish our bodies inside and out. 255 ACID REFLUXBackground ResearchPeppermint. Helps relax the gastrointestinal muscles, allowing painful gas to pass. Ginger. Can soothe the stomach and help it release its contents into the small intestines. Fennel. Balances the pH level within the body, especially within the stomach. Lemon. D-limonene (compound in lemon peels) helps to calm stomach pains and relieve nausea. 3 Home RemedySuggested Supplements Digestive enzymes. Take at the start of each meal to help foods fully digest and nutrients absorb properly. Probiotics. Reduce levels of bad bacteria and can improve indigestion, leaky gut and acid reflux. Take 25 to 50 billion CFU daily.\u00bb \u00bbA 2015 study evaluated the gastro-protective activity of ginger essential oil in laboratory animals. The ginger essential oil treatment reduced ulcers by 85 percent. 4 Reflux ease. Add 1 drop each of peppermint, ginger, fennel and lemon essential oils to a beverage, or mix the oil blend with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and honey to taste and consume internally. Between 25 percent and 40 percent of Americans suffer from acid reflux, and an estimated 20 percent of adults experience a more severe form of acid reflux known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Despite what we've been told for years, too much stomach acid is not the cause of acid reflux. The primary trigger of heartburn and GERD is acid entering the esophagus because of a leaky valve. Causes of acid reflux include pregnancy, hiatal hernias and an unhealthy diet. Unfortunately, the prescription and OTC drugs that are given for acid reflux do not target the root cause and can have major side effects. Natural acid reflux remedies may help to balance stomach acid and relieve symptoms such as heartburn, gas, bloating, bad breath and sore throat. 256 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILS CONDITIONSACNE ResearchMelaleuca (Tea Tree). Helps destroy the skin-dwelling bacteria that cause acne. Holy Basil and Manuka. Ideal for skin care due to their anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties. Juniper Berry.

In regard to overall acne improvement, tea tree oil was 5.8 times more effective than the placebo. 7 Acne face wash. Mix 1 tablespoon coconut oil, 3 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, 20 drops melaleuca and 2 capsules of probiotics. Pour into a convenient bottle and store in cool, dry place. Acne is a condition that plagues millions of American children and adults. The main cause of acne is clogged pores that lead to bacteria and yeast overgrowth on the skin. Poor diet, stress and medications such as oral contraceptives and corticosteroids can worsen acne. Other factors such as systemic inflammation, hormone fluctuations and increased cortisol levels can also exacerbate acne. Many patients are unaware that drugs such as tretinoin (the active ingredient in Retin-A) can cause serious side effects, including conjunctivitis, permanently thinned skin, extreme burning and dark circles. We believe it's well worth implementing natural home remedies for acne that tackle the root of the problem and are gentle on the skin. 257 ESSENTIAL OILSBackgroundADD/ADHD Everyone can have difficulty sitting still, paying attention or controlling behavior from time to time. For some people, however, the problems are so pervasive that they interfere with every aspect of their life. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral condition affecting 11 percent of school-age children, and symptoms continue into adulthood in more than three-quarters of all cases. 8 It is characterized by difficulty concentrating, impulsiveness and hyperactivity. In ADD, the symptom of hyperactivity is absent. Scientists have discovered genetics may contribute to ADHD. Other contributing factors may include leaky gut syndrome, a high sugar diet, food sensitivities and exposure to toxins such as pesticides or lead. Research In 2001, a study found that vetiver oil is effective in helping children with ADHD. After 30 days, vetiver oil was able to double the children's performance levels, helping them to combat ADD and ADHD symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and diminished focus. 9Vetiver. Inspires a harmonious state while promoting deep concentration. Cedarwood. May improve focus and clear thinking. Rosemary. Has been correlated with both improved memory and brain function. Lavender. May create a calmer mind and more relaxed state. Home Remedy Focus Blend. Combine 1 to 2 drops vetiver with a carrier oil and apply to the wrists or behind the ears.

May improve attention and the gut-brain connection. Zinc. Low levels are associated with poor neurological function, poor attention and a variety of motor disorders.\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb 258 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSADDICTION People with an addiction have little to no control over what they are doing, taking or using. Addictions can include not only things we consume, such as food, drugs or alcohol, but may include virtually anything, from gambling to psychological dependencies. Recent estimates suggest that as many as 23.5 million Americans are addicted to alcohol or drugs, and one in 20 people have been found to have a food addiction. 11 The causes of addiction vary considerably and are generally caused by a combination of physical, mental, circumstantial and emotional factors. People who are fighting an addiction may often respond well to natural remedies, behavioral modifications, intervention and support from family and friends. Research A 2006 study found that lemon essential oil had strong anti-stress effects. In the study, laboratory animals were exposed to three stress-inducing behavioral tasks. The results suggested that lemon oil possesses notable antidepressant-like effects. 13Rosemary. Contains mood elevating qualities; helps to reduce stress and anxiety. Lavender. Shown to have the ability to enhance mood and calm the mind. 12 Lemon and Bergamot. Enhance mood and increase energy. Black Pepper and Peppermint.

A powerful anti- inflammatory agent that can boost energy. Rose. Shown to promote calm, relaxation and a decrease in blood pressure. Home RemedySuggested Supplements Ashwagandha. An adaptogen; especially good at reducing cortisol levels and helping the adrenals adjust to stress. B-Complex. Vitamin B12 and other B vitamins reduce stress and improve cellular energy.\u00bb \u00bbIn a 2009 study, the test group receiving rose essential oil rather than a placebo through their skin felt greater feelings of calm and relaxation, as well as a decrease in blood pressure and breathing rate. 16 Warm Adrenal Compress. Dilute 3 to 5 drops of holy basil or rosemary essential oil in a carrier oil and apply it directly to your skin over the kidney area. Then add a warm compress. The oil mixture can also be applied to the reflex points on your feet. When your brain registers a threat, the body releases adrenaline hormones to help you react (known as the \"fight or flight\" response). The adrenal cortex then releases corticosteroids to inhibit processes such as digestion, immune system response and other functions not necessary for immediate survival. Adrenal fatigue occurs when the body and adrenal glands can't keep up with the amount of daily stress many people experience, and those \"unnecessary functions\" become largely neglected for extended periods of time. Most people struggle with adrenal fatigue at some point in their lives. Common symptoms include weight gain, insomnia, reduced sex drive, body aches, trouble concentrating, racing thoughts, irritability, constantly feeling tired, hormone imbalance and food cravings. 260 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSAGING SKIN ResearchYlang Ylang.

Place the mixture in a dark glass bottle. Use in the morning and at night on your face and neck.Many factors cause our skin to age. Some we can influence; others we cannot. Over time, we all get visible lines on our face and notice our skin becoming thinner and drier. Genetics is understood to play a major role in the timing of this process. However, we can have influence over another type of aging, and that is the premature aging caused by environmental factors and lifestyle choices. For example, excessive sugar consumption, stress, toxicity and smoking can lead to an acceleration of the aging process. Even people who already have signs of premature skin aging can benefit from making lifestyle changes and adding certain supplements, including essential oils, to their daily regimen. 261 ESSENTIAL OILSBackgroundALLERGIES ResearchEucalyptus.

Today, 40 to 60 million Americans are affected by allergies\u2014and the numbers continue to rise, especially in children. Allergies can cause a blocked and runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, headaches and an impaired sense of smell. For some people, allergies can be life threatening, leading to acute inflammation and shortness of breath. People who suffer from allergies are often told to avoid triggers, but that is nearly impossible when the seasons are changing and our immune systems are impaired by improper diets and environmental toxins. Thankfully, key essential oils serve as a natural and safe way to address the symptoms of allergies and boost our immune systems. \u00bb 262 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ResearchRosemary.

Patients showed improvement in cognitive function after regular inhalation. 22 Daily Brain Boost. Add 1 to 2 drops of lemon essential oil to a glass of water and consume daily. Also, a blend of rosemary and lemon can be diffused or applied topically to your neck.Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and other important mental functions. Experts suggest that more than 5 million Americans may have Alzheimer's, with two-thirds of those being women. As this type of dementia progresses, more serious symptoms are experienced, such as mood swings, long-term memory loss, confusion, irritability and aggression. There are several theories to explain the formation of this disease, including free radical damage, an inability to use glucose properly, vitamin deficiencies and environmental toxins. Studies have shown that essential oils may help manage dementia symptoms by supporting brain function and neurological development. 263 BackgroundLavender. Aids neurological issues such as anxiety, migraines and depression. Roman Chamomile. May ease feelings of paranoia and aggression. Vetiver.

Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. 264 | CONDITIONS In today's fast-paced, high-pressure society, it's almost impossible not to feel anxious at some point in life. That is why an estimated 40 million American adults are affected by anxiety. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time. These feelings can interfere with daily activities involving his or her job, schoolwork and relationships. Constant anxiety can lead to high blood pressure, insomnia, digestive problems and panic attacks. Some causes include stress, thyroid problems and hormone imbalance, as well as excessive alcohol, caffeine or sugar intake. ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSARTHRITIS Research Home RemedySuggested Supplements Fish Oil. An 18-month study showed that taking fish oil \"exhibited significant reductions\" in arthritis activity. 27 Take 1,000 milligrams of high-quality fish oil daily. Turmeric.

Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. While anyone can have back pain, factors that increase your risk are age, poor physical fitness, being overweight, heredity, your job, pregnancy and chronic conditions such as arthritis. Low back pain can also be a warning sign of spinal abnormalities or a result of poor posture. The most common treatments for back pain are NSAIDS, such as aspirin and acetaminophen, along with more potent prescription pain medications. These drugs can have adverse side effects and have been linked to liver damage and intestinal bleeding. 36 Peppermint and Wintergreen. Cool inflamed joints andreduce back pain. Frankincense.

Take one scoop of an organic greens formula with sea vegetables, grass juices, vegetables and herbs, all of which help alkalize the body. Soil-Based Probiotics. Good bacteria such as bacillus subtilis may help clear the digestive tract of odor-causing yeasts (candida) and pathogenic bacteria from the body. \u00bb \u00bbAlthough sweat itself is fairly odorless when skin is clean, once the bacteria that live on skin mixes with sweat, they multiply and begin to leave an unpleasant odor. The sweatiest areas are usually the smelliest, including armpits, back, chest, feet and between the legs. That's because these areas tend to have more sweat-producing follicles and are also dark, warm, moist environments that nurture bacteria. Human body odors change throughout the life cycle, as does someone's ability to detoxify through their pores. So, unless you are part of the lucky 2 percent of people who carry an unusual form of a specific gene that means their underarms never smell, you need the help of natural remedies to keep odor at bay. 40Research Home RemedyA 2006 report stated that tea tree oil contains active ingredients that significantly reduce harmful bacteria that grow on skin. 41 DIY Deodorant.

It often develops after another type of upper respiratory infection such as a cold or flu and can affect any age group. Antibiotics are the most common form of treatment, but conventional medications can lead to damaging side effects such as digestive issues. In cases of acute bronchitis, conventional antibiotics are of little value, as the root cause is viral. Some people develop chronic bronchitis\u2014a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD\u2014which is primarily caused by cigarette smoking or environmental irritants.

Take 50 billion CFU twice daily.\u00bb \u00bbCandida is a yeast that aids with nutrient absorption and digestion when produced in proper levels in the body; however, if the body's natural pH balance is upset, candida can quickly grow out of control. With approximately 460,000 cases each year, candida (or candidiasis) is a common yeast infection that can lead to many health problems, from a sore throat to serious stomach conditions. Common causes of candida overgrowth include taking antibiotics, birth control pills and oral corticosteroids; excess sugar consumption; and experiencing too much internal dampness. Candida can cause a white coating on the tongue, headaches, an inability to concentrate, chronic fatigue, sugar cravings and stomach issues. Oral thrush is a yeast infection caused by the same strain of candida that affects other mucous membranes, including the vagina.

It is extremely common, affecting up to 6 percent of adults in the U.S. The carpal tunnel, which houses the median nerve, can become thickened and cause the nerve to be compressed. The result may be pain, weakness or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm. Women are three times more likely than men to develop carpal tunnel syndrome, perhaps because the carpal tunnel itself may be smaller in women. Other contributing factors include trauma or injury to the wrist that cause swelling, such as sprain or fracture, hypothyroidism, arthritis, work stress, repeated use of vibrating hand tools or fluid retention during pregnancy or menopause.

It can be contagious to people who haven't had the disease or haven't been vaccinated against it. For most people, chickenpox is a mild disease; the infection usually lasts about five to seven days. Common signs and symptoms of chickenpox include a rash, fever, loss of appetite, headache and tiredness. Once the chickenpox rash appears, it will go through three phases: raised pink or red bumps, fluid-filled blisters that will break and leak after a day and finally, crusts and scabs that take several days to heal.

Normally, cholesterol is kept in balance, but the standard western diet contains a large amount of hydrogenated fats and refined carbohydrates, which leads to an upset in this balance. This is manifested in elevated LDL levels and low HDL levels, an imbalance that affects 102 million Americans. Over time, LDL cholesterol can oxidize and build up in the arteries and lead to serious health problems, such as heart attack or stroke. To address this, millions of cholesterol-lowering prescriptions are written each year (statins are the most common), many of which can cause cramping, constipation, liver problems and more. Lavender. Shown to decrease emotional stress, which can lower cholesterol levels. Lemongrass. Shown to sustain healthy levels of triglycerides and reduce LDL cholesterol. 65 Rosemary.

One of the disease's challenges is that it's impossible to diagnose with lab tests alone. However, some experts believe it is closely related to adrenal fatigue or system-wide inflammation of the body. Over a million Americans are suffering from this debilitating illness that manifests with a lack of energy and motivation, and women are two to four times more likely than men to be diagnosed. When left untreated, it decreases stamina, memory, concentration and overall quality of life.

Mix 1 to 2 drops of fennel, peppermint and chamomile with a carrier oil, and apply the mixture to the infant's stomach with gentle circular rubbing. Colic is not a disease but a combination of baffling behaviors in an otherwise healthy baby. Occurring in one out of five infants, the true definition of colic follows the \"rule of three:\" The baby's crying starts at around three weeks old, lasts more than three hours at a stretch, occurs at least three days a week and persists for at least three weeks in a row. It usually starts a few weeks after birth and often improves by the age of three months. Underlying causes of colic are not fully understood, but some experts believe colic manifests due to an immature digestive system, infant acid reflux, food allergies or sensitivity or tobacco exposure.

There are over 200 viruses that can cause a cold. Cold viruses take up residence in the lining of the nose and grow, eventually attempting to infect the body. If the body is weak or unable to resist the germs, it will get sick. Despite what some people think, there's no evidence that cold weather, large tonsils or other such wives' tales can make you \"catch\" a cold. 72 Evidence does suggest that stress and allergies can increase your chances of getting a cold.

Take 1 to 2 drops each of fennel oil, peppermint oil and ginger oil in a spoonful of honey or applesauce just before meals.Constipation is slower than normal movement of food waste through the digestive tract. This slow movement leads to difficulty in emptying the bowels, usually associated with hardened feces. Estimates suggest that as many as 63 million people suffer from constipation in the U.S. 76 It is often accompanied by symptoms such as bloating, gas, back pain, hemorrhoids or fatigue. The main cause stems from a lack of water, healthy fats, probiotics and fiber in the diet. Stress, inactivity, certain medications, an imbalance in intestinal flora, thyroid problems and a magnesium deficiency can also cause constipation. For some people, being constipated is just the prelude to other major health problems.

Add 1 drop each of lemon oil, frankincense oil, peppermint oil and Roman chamomile oil to a spoonful of honey and take as needed. Coughing is a common reaction of the respiratory system trying to expel harmful microbes, dust or irritants. As mucus or other substances accumulate in the airways, this reflexive action attempts to facilitate unobstructed breathing. A cough can be nothing more than the body's natural reaction to an irritant, or it can be a symptom of an underlying illness or even lung cancer. Coughing is generally caused by an infection (such as upper respiratory infections, sinus infections and pneumonia) but may also have noninfectious causes (such as asthma, allergies, GERD and chronic bronchitis).

One common oral concern is tooth decay, which occurs when foods containing carbohydrates such as milk, soda, cakes and candy are frequently left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods and produce acids as a result. Over time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay and other dental concerns. Over 90 percent of adults ages 20 to 64 have had tooth decay. Some common causes of dental issues include lack of good oral hygiene habits, consumption of processed sugar, a lack of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and a deficiency in minerals such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus.

Diabetes has grown to \"epidemic\" proportions since the latest statistics state that 25.8 million Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic. It is also the seventh leading cause of death in America. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Some of the causes that trigger this response may include exposure to a virus, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), heavy metals, vaccines or foods such as wheat, milk and soy. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and is caused by insulin resistance; it is generally caused by genetics and unhealthy lifestyle habits. The most common complications from diabetes include high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease, neuropathy, Alzheimer's disease and in extreme cases, amputations.

When you have diarrhea, your bowel movements (stools) are loose and watery. It's incredibly common and although it feels bad, it's usually not serious. For many people, diarrhea strikes once or twice each year. If you have certain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it can happen more often. Diarrhea can have a variety of causes, including food allergies, infections, emotional stress or autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's. Symptoms of diarrhea include an urgent feeling that you need to go to the bathroom, bloating, cramps and thin, loose or watery stools.

For children, dilute the oil with a carrier oil. An ear infection is an inflammation of the inner, middle or outer ear caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years are more susceptible to ear infections because of the size and shape of their ear tubes, and because of their immature immune systems. Symptoms may include earaches and thick, yellow fluid coming from the ears. A middle ear infection is generally related to an allergy or upper respiratory infection and is caused by fluid buildup in the ear. Swimmer's ear is caused by water getting trapped in the ear canal due to the buildup of wax; this causes bacteria to grow and an infection to occur. Ear infections can either be viral or bacterial, but viral infections are much more common; therefore, treatment with conventional antibiotics typically is ineffective and may include adverse side effects.

Babies with eczema typically have it on the face, especially the cheeks and chin, but they can also have it on the scalp, chest, back and outer arms and legs. Children and adults typically have the telltale rash on their necks, wrists, ankles and in areas that bend. The specific cause of eczema remains unknown, but it is believed to develop due to a combination of hereditary and environmental factors.

Although hair loss may seem like a more prominent problem in men (two-thirds of men face hair loss by age 35), women are nearly as likely to lose, or have thinning, hair. Male-pattern baldness is an inherited sensitivity to DHT, a by-product of testosterone, which leads to finer hair, a receding hairline and finally a deserted scalp. Female pattern baldness is characterized by thinning on the top or center of the head. Female hair loss is generally due to high levels of stress, hormone imbalance, thyroid conditions or toxic exposure.

You can also apply 1 to 2 drops of helichrysum, lavender, turmeric and frankincense to your neck area to help ease some of the symptoms associated with lupus.Lupus is an inflammatory disease caused when the immune system attacks its own tissues. This attack leads to inflammation and chronic pain in the skin, joints and muscles. Lupus can also cause sun sensitivity, weight loss, hair loss and digestive problems. In 50 percent of cases, lupus causes a rash on the face known as a butterfly rash, which can get worse with sunlight and also appear on other parts of the body. Research indicates that at least 1.5 million Americans have lupus. Potential causes include allergic reactions, viruses, emotional stress, estrogen disruption due to pregnancy or birth control, hormonal imbalances, poor digestion and metal toxicity. Natural remedies for lupus\u2014including an anti-inflammatory diet, exercise and essential oils for pain and stress reduction\u2014can help manage symptoms and prevent further complications. \u00bb 312 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSLYME DISEASE ResearchFrankincense.

Add 10 drops each of Roman chamomile, frankincense and lemongrass oils along with 1 cup of Epsom salt to a warm bath. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week in the evening. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection primarily transmitted by deer ticks and black-legged ticks. According to estimates, more than 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with the tick-borne disease each year. 150 Because diagnosing Lyme can be difficult, many people who have Lyme disease may be misdiagnosed with other conditions. Thus, many experts believe the true number of cases is much higher. Symptoms can start with flu-like symptoms, including headaches and muscle and joint pain. A \"bulls eye\" rash may occur at the spot of the bite. It can also cause arthritis that persists months or years after the tick bite. Over time, the symptoms can continue to worsen and turn into a chronic inflammatory condition. 313 BackgroundMENOPAUSE ResearchClary Sage. Offers relief from symptoms such as hot flashes.

Menopause is a natural decline in reproductive hormones that begins when a woman reaches her 40s or 50s. The duration of menopause is very hard to predict, as each woman's situation is vastly different. Women typically begin experiencing hot flashes, mood swings, vaginal dryness and other menopause symptoms when they are going through perimenopause. This stage is generally considered part of the menopause period and can last anywhere from 10 months to four years, as the ovaries gradually decrease estrogen production. However, menopause is not considered to have officially begun until a woman misses her period for 12 straight months. Menopause is a natural biological process; although it ends fertility, women can stay healthy and vital. \u00bb 314 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ResearchFrankincense. neurologicalsupport.

MS affects 2.5 million people worldwide and around 400,000 people in the U.S. MS affects women more than men, and while the disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, it can be seen at any age. Although no specific cause is known, some possible suspects include infections, mold toxicity, emotional stress, hormonal imbalances, toxic exposure, vitamin D deficiency, food allergies and immunizations. Common symptoms of MS include blurred or double vision, trouble thinking, loss of coordination, loss of balance, numbness, tingling and limb weakness. 315 BackgroundMUSCLE ACHESA muscle cramp is an involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscle that does not relax.

Rub peppermint, ginger and lavender oils behind your ears or on your stomach, or take it internally to help relieve nausea.Almost everyone at some point in life has experienced symptoms of nausea, that sick feeling in your stomach that often comes just before vomiting. There are many causes of nausea, but some of the most common include pregnancy, food poisoning, motion sickness, flu symptoms, gallbladder distress, medications, migraine headaches and emotional stress. Morning sickness is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs during pregnancy. The timing of the nausea or vomiting can sometimes indicate the cause. For example, when it appears shortly after a meal, nausea or vomiting may be caused by food poisoning, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) or an ulcer. If nausea leads to severe vomiting, dehydration becomes a concern. The next time your stomach is uneasy, use essential oils for natural relief. 317 NAUSEA Peppermint.

Parkinson's affects up to 1 million people in the U.S., and 60,000 new cases occur each year. Parkinson's strikes 50 percent more men than women, and the average age of onset is 60. Generally, those with Parkinson's lose the ability to speak properly, have difficulty walking and may also experience tremors. This happens because people with Parkinson's do not produce enough dopamine, which is an important chemical necessary for proper body movements and function. There is no specific known cause, but some aggravating factors include exposure to toxicity, inflammatory brain disorders, free radicals, poor nutrition and food allergies. Lavender.

Warm up a tablespoon of coconut oil and add 2 drops each of rosemary, thyme and turmeric oils. Deeply massage the mixture into your heel. Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of a thick band of tissue (called the plantar fascia) that connects the heel bone to the toes. If you strain your plantar fascia, it gets weak, swollen and irritated or inflamed. As a result, your heel or the bottom of your foot hurts when you stand or walk. This inflammation is the most common cause of heel pain. Around one in 10 people will develop plantar fasciitis at some time in their life, and it is seen regularly among middle-aged people, athletes or people who are on their feet a lot. It is twice as common in women as it is in men. You are also more likely to develop plantar fasciitis if you have pronated feet, high arches, are overweight or wear ill fitting or worn out shoes. Pain is the main symptom, and it is often at its worst when you take your first steps after getting up in the morning, or after long periods of rest where no weight is placed on your foot.

For most people, pneumonia can be treated at home; it often clears up in two to three weeks. But older adults, infants and people with other diseases or a weakened immune system can become very ill. In the U.S., about 3 million cases of pneumonia are reported each year, and about 60,000 people die as a result of the condition. About one-third of cases occur in people over age 65. You may be more likely to present symptoms of the disease after having a cold or the flu; these illnesses make it hard for your lungs to fight infection, so it is easier to get pneumonia. Having a long-term, or chronic disease also makes you more likely to contract pneumonia. Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, fever, fast or labored breathing, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain and extreme fatigue. Eucalyptus and Peppermint.

Women with PCOS develop enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts on them, which then start producing higher than normal levels of androgen hormones, such as testosterone. This reaction can also cause imbalanced levels of estrogen and low levels of progesterone and may be responsible for as much as 70 percent of infertility in women. Symptoms of PCOS may include irregular periods, trouble conceiving, acne, stubborn weight loss, insulin resistance, fatigue and low sex drive. In severe cases, PCOS can cause severe hair thinning and masculine characteristics (like hair growth on the face). Major improvements can occur with a good diet (less sugar and more vegetables, healthy fats and bone broth), managing stress and using natural compounds. POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME Holy Basil.

It's estimated that as many as three of every four menstruating women have experienced some form of PMS. Symptoms may start a week or two before the period and can be mild to severe. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle seem to be an important cause; chemical changes in the brain may also be involved. Stress and emotional problems do not seem to cause PMS, but they may make it worse. About 3 to 8 percent of women have a more severe form of PMS, called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which can be debilitating. The good news is that if you improve your diet, manage stress and implement natural remedies, you can experience significant improvements in the symptoms associated with PMS.Clary Sage.

The most distinctive aspect of the condition is that lying down and trying to relax activates the symptoms, which include throbbing, pulling, creeping or other unpleasant sensations in the legs. The sensations can be irritating and painful, and moving the legs helps to relieve the discomfort. Most people with RLS have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. When left untreated, RLS can lead to sleep deprivation and affect a person's ability to concentrate and complete daily tasks. This may also lead to depression and impaired memory. As many as 10 percent of the U.S. population may have RLS, and childhood RLS is estimated to affect almost 1 million children.

Once you contract chickenpox, the virus \"sleeps\" in your nerve roots. In some people, it stays dormant forever; in others, the virus \"wakes up\" when disease, stress or aging weakens the immune system, which is why shingles (closely associated with chickenpox) is most common in older adults and in people who have compromised immune systems. Shingles symptoms happen in stages: At first, you may have a headache, light sensitivity and flu symptoms. Next, you may feel itching, tingling or pain in an area before a rash appears in a band or strip on one side of the face or body. The rash later turns into clusters of blisters that fill with fluid and crust over, taking up to four weeks to heal.

Symptoms of sinusitis may include fever, weakness, fatigue, cough, congestion and mucus drainage in the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. About 90 percent of adults seen in the U.S. by a general practice physician for sinusitis are prescribed an antibiotic, even though antibiotics may not always be the best remedy, according to recent research and physician experts. 194 Your body should be able to naturally overcome mild or moderate sinusitis without medication that can cause antibiotic resistance. Essential oils can greatly help with sinusitis symptoms, allowing your immune system to do its job. Research Home RemedyAn active ingredient in thyme oil, thymol, has been shown to be effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria strains, showing promise as a therapy for highly drug-resistant infections .196 Vapor Rub.

Strep throat can affect children and adults of all ages. However, it's especially common in children between the ages of 5 and 15. Sneezing and coughing can spread the infection from one person to another. The common symptoms of strep throat include sudden fever; sore, red throat with white patches; headache; chills; swollen lymph nodes and trouble swallowing. If a child has six or more severe throat infections in one year, his or her doctor might suggest surgery to remove the tonsils. However, many children tend to stop having recurring instances of strep throat as they get older. The decision to remove a child's tonsils must be weighed against the risks of anesthesia and bleeding, as well as the missed school days to recover from the procedure. Eucalyptus. Stimulates immunity; improves respiratory circulation. 198 Peppermint. Contains menthol, which helps to soothe a sore throat and thin mucus. Thyme. Contains anti-bacterial properties that boost immunity and fight infections. Oregano. Proven to fight infections andpromote healing. Suggested Supplements Garlic.

Allow the baby to suck on a non-ripe (very hard) pineapple core. Bromelain found in the stem and core of a pineapple helps with inflammation and pain. Homeopathic Teething Tablets. Made with natural ingredients that dissolve easily under your baby's tongue. \u00bb \u00bbA 2006 study showed that clove oil worked just as well as benzocaine at numbing the pain caused by toothache and infection. 201 Teething Oil. Mix 1 teaspoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 to 2 drops of clove oil. Shake well and apply it sparingly to the gums with your fingertip. Reapply every 2 to 3 hours as needed. Test the mixture on yourself before applying to make sure it is not too strong. Teething can be very challenging for babies and parents. While teething can begin as early as three months of age, you'll most likely see the first tooth start pushing through your baby's gum line when your little one is between four and seven months old. Researchers note that during teething, there is a notable increase in biting, drooling, gum rubbing, sucking, irritability, wakefulness and ear rubbing. Your baby might also have a facial rash and decreased appetite. These symptoms tend to manifest in the few days before and after a tooth's emergence from the gums. Although tender and swollen gums could cause your baby's temperature to be a little higher than normal, teething doesn't usually cause high fever or diarrhea. Essential oils such as clove can help your baby through the most uncomfortable teething symptoms. Remember to use common sense when it comes to essential oils and babies\u2014as a little bit goes a long way. 333 TEETHING Clove.

To help reduce pain and speed up blood flow, mix 2 drops each of frankincense, cypress and peppermint oils with \u00bd teaspoon of coconut oil. Apply the mixture to the painful area three to five times daily with a warm compress.Tendonitis is an inflammation or irritation of a tendon\u2014a thick cord that attaches bone to muscle. It is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the affected area, or from a sudden, more serious injury. Activities that often cause tendonitis are carpentry, gardening, tennis, golf, painting and scrubbing. Anyone can get tendonitis, but it is more common in adults, especially those over 40 years of age. As tendons age, they tolerate less stress, are less elastic and tear easier. Symptoms include pain at the site of the tendon and surrounding area. Shoulder tendonitis involves the loss of motion and flexibility and is often called \"adhesive capsulitis,\" or frozen shoulder. Conventional treatments for tendonitis such as NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.) and corticosteroid injections can lead to liver problems, stomach pain, high blood pressure and more. Try these essential oils for a safer way to get relief from tendonitis pain. \u00bb 334 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSTOENAIL FUNGUS ResearchOregano.

Combine 3 drops of oregano oil and 2 drops of tea tree oil, and then apply the mixture directly on the toenail four times a day. This must be done consistently, every day, for maximum benefit. Nail fungus (or onychomycosis) is a common condition that begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of your nail. The fungus causes the toenail, particularly on the big toe, to thicken and discolor; the end may separate from the nail bed. Often, the nail is so thick you can't cut it. In severe cases, the nail may detach and fall off. Older people are more likely to suffer from nail fungus, and those with compromised immune systems are even more susceptible. It also affects more men than women. Diabetes and vascular problems are additional risk factors. Few are aware that toenail fungus symptoms can actually be a sign of candida yeast overgrowth within your system. Toenail fungus can cause pain and difficulty walking, not to mention self-consciousness when wearing sandals. Toenail fungus is notoriously difficult to treat, but the essential oils listed below have been shown to be effective against some fungus strains. 335 BackgroundULCERS ResearchRoman Chamomile.

Add 2 drops each of peppermint oil and Roman chamomile oil to your water twice daily until symptoms subside.About one in every 10 Americans will suffer from the burning, gnawing abdominal pain of a peptic ulcer (in the stomach) or gastric ulcer (in the small intestine) at some point in life. Ulcers are similar to burns that form in the lining of the upper part of the GI tract. Until the mid-1980s, it was widely believed that ulcers formed as a result of stress, a genetic predisposition to excessive stomach acid secretion and poor lifestyle habits. While excessive stomach acid secretion certainly plays a role in the development of ulcers, a recent theory holds that bacterial infection is the primary cause of peptic ulcers. Other factors that may contribute to ulcer formation include excessive use of over-the-counter painkillers (such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen), heavy alcohol consumption, psychological stress and smoking. With burning pain as the most common symptom, peptic ulcers affect as many as 5 million people in the U.S. alone. \u00bb 336 | CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL OILSBackground CONDITIONSResearch Home RemedySuggested Supplements D-mannose.

A urinary tract infection (UTI), or bladder infection, is an infection involving the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra that is caused by bacterial overgrowth in the bladder's interior walls. It leads to pain during urination, a frequent need to urinate and fever. The culprit in at least 90 percent of UTIs is a type of bacteria called Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. If you're a woman, your chance of getting a UTI is high; some experts rank your lifetime risk of getting one as high as one in two\u2014with many women having repeat infections, sometimes for years on end. UTIs are much more common in adults than in children, but about 1 to 2 percent of children do get them. In the U.S., UTIs account for more than 7 million visits to medical offices and hospitals each year. The most common causes of a UTI include sexual intercourse, overconsumption of sugar, pregnancy, antibiotic use, hormone imbalances and injury to the area. URINARY TRACT INFECTION Oregano.

ESSENTIAL OILS Background 337 VARICOSE VEINSVaricose veins are enlarged veins that can be blue, red or flesh-colored. They often look like cords and appear twisted and bulging. Spider veins are similar to varicose veins but are smaller and closer to the surface of the skin. An estimated 30 to 60 percent of adults have varicose veins or spider veins. Varicose veins are typically caused by weak or damaged valves in the veins, while spider veins are most often caused by the backup of blood. They can also be caused by hormone changes, excessive exposure to the sun and injuries. Varicose veins often affect the legs, since they are the farthest from the heart and gravity makes it harder for the blood to flow upward. For many people, varicose veins and spider veins are simply a cosmetic concern. For others, varicose veins can cause aching pain and discomfort. Sometimes varicose veins lead to more serious problems. Some potential causes of varicose veins include obesity, pregnancy, standing for long periods of time, inactivity and hormone imbalance.

Apply it nightly until the warts have receded.A wart is a small, hard, benign growth on the skin caused by a virus. In order to target the exact course of action for eliminating warts, it helps to determine exactly what type of warts you have. Types of warts include common warts (which represent 70 percent of non-genital warts), flat warts, plantar warts and genital warts. Since they are caused by a virus, warts generally do not respond to medication. The root cause of every wart is human papillomavirus (HPV), of which there are more than 100 types. Warts are caused by direct contact with HPV, which is contagious and makes skin grow faster than usual. HPV can infect the skin via areas of minimal trauma such as cuts or abrasions. The main symptoms of warts are small, fleshy, grainy bumps. Essential oils provide what antibiotics can't\u2014the ability to fight viruses and help address the root cause of warts. WARTS Tea Tree.

We encourage you to utilize these sections that include reference tables as a guide to understanding some of the more specialized areas of essential oil usage.CHAPTER 6 REFLEXOLOGY AND MASSAGEThe human body is an amazing, complex and uniquely designed machine. The fact that our bodies turn food into both fuel and living tissue, our hearts pump blood through thousands of miles of blood vessels and our brains send billions of bits of information throughout the body that control every action\u2014right down to the flicker of an eyelid\u2014is a demonstration that we are the work of an intelligent and skillful designer. What's even more amazing is that, according to Genesis 1:27, \"...God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him, male and female created He them.\" We truly are \"fearfully and wonderfully made.\" Our bodies have an incredible level of organization from the molecular level to the tissue level. God put such thought into the balance of our bodily functions and systems\u2014so much that one change at the micron level can lead to health issues and even disease. In this chapter, we are going to examine two forms of body therapy that assist our bodies in doing their intricate, immense and unremitting jobs. The power of touch can move energy and focus to the areas of the body in need of special attention\u2014and in combination with the use of essential oils, body therapies can facilitate healing on all levels and be an effective way to relieve symptoms that occur both internally and externally. 349 350 | SPECIAL USEREFLEXOLOGY \"Reflexology\" and \"foot massage\" are often synonymous, but putting these two in the same category does this ancient practice an injustice. Reflexology involves massaging the feet, but more specifically, it is a hands-on complementary therapy that is based on the premise that there are zones and reflex areas in the feet (also the hands and ears) that correspond to all body parts. The physical act of applying specific pressures using thumb, finger and hand techniques results in stress reduction that causes physiological changes in the body. Reflexology dates back thousands of years to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, India and China. The oldest known documentation of reflexology is a pictograph found in the tomb of an Egyptian physician that depicts patients having treatments done on their hands and feet. The modern form of reflexology was first brought to light in the early 1900s by a surgeon named Dr. William Fitzgerald. He discovered that exerting pressure on the tips of the toes or fingers caused corresponding parts of the body to become anaesthetized. From this, Dr. Fitzgerald divided the body into 10 equal zones and aptly named it \"zone therapy.\" Amazingly, by using tight elastic bands on the middle sections of the fingers or small clamps on the tips of the fingers, he found it was no longer necessary to use anesthetic agents during minor surgeries! The subject of zone therapy was a controversial one, although it met with a certain amount of success with osteopaths and dentists in the mid 1900s. A physiotherapist named Eunice Ingram worked in a doctor's office where Dr. Fitzgerald's zone therapy was being used on patients' hands. Ms. Ingham thought, however, that it would be more effective to be practiced on the feet rather than the hands. She extended the work of Dr. Fitzgerald and painstakingly mapped the feet, where one point on the foot corresponds to a certain part of the body. See figure 6.1 for a map of these corresponding areas on the feet. SPECIAL USE351 Figure 6.1. Foot Reflexology Chart. By using acupressure or massage techniques on these points in the feet, a positive effect is created in the corresponding body part.Head/Brain Teeth/Sinuses Eye Ear Trapezius Armpit Lung/Chest Arm Shoulder Liver Gall Bladder Kidney Elbow Leg/Knee Ascending Colon Small Intestine Appendix Sciatic NerveHead/Brain Teeth/Sinuses Eye Ear Trapezius Armpit Lung/Chest Heart Arm Shoulder Liver Spleen Elbow Kidney Leg/Knee Descending Colon Small IntestineSciatic NervePituitary Throat Nose Neck Cervical SPECIAL USEThere are many theories about how reflexology works, but the most commonly held belief is that the practice works to relax reflexes that are connected to various parts of the body, improving lymphatic drainage and circulation as well as relaxing muscles and stimulating nerve connections. Since experts believe that stress causes up to 90 percent of all illness, by relaxing the recipient, reflexology may help to prevent and heal damage from stress. 1 Reflexology works with zones, and it is believed that by \"clearing\" the zones, you allow energy to flow in the body and healing can occur. Nerve endings can become calcified and therefore dysfunctional. Through reflexology, you can \"break up\" this calcification and re-establish communication in the body by stimulating circulation and promoting detoxification. Reflexology also works through the communication of the nervous system. There are over 7,200 nerve endings in each foot. Stimulating these nerves has a huge impact on the entire body. By applying calm, healing touch, the entire body can relax and be soothed.HOW DOES IT WORK? One large review of reflexology summarized 168 research studies and abstracts from journals and meetings from around the world. 2 Many of these studies originated in peer-reviewed journals in China and Korea. All of the studies contained information about the frequency and duration of the reflexology application. Based on the studies reviewed, it was concluded that reflexology may: Have a positive impact on specific organs. Various reports state that MRI readings have demonstrated an increase in blood flow to kidneys and to the intestines after reflexology massage. Be associated with an improvement of a wide variety of symptoms. Positive changes were noted in kidney functioning with kidney dialysis patients. In another study, 100 percent of cancer patients reported significant improvement in symptoms after three reflexology sessions. WHAT DOES IT DO? \u00bb \u00bb SPECIAL USE353 Improved areas included appetite, fatigue, mobility, mood, nausea, pain and sleep.3 Create a relaxation effect. In certain studies, blood pressure was decreased and anxiety was lowered after a series of reflexology massages. Aid in pain reduction associated with certain conditions. Twenty- seven separate studies demonstrated a positive outcome for reduction in pain; e.g., AIDS, chest pain, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes mellitus, kidney stones and osteoarthritis. 4 Help alleviate headache pain. After three months of reflexology massage, 81 percent of the patients in one study claimed that the therapy either considerably helped or completely eliminated their headaches, and 19 percent who previously took prescription or OTC drugs to manage the pain were able to stop their medication altogether. 5 Boost cardiovascular health. By reducing baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, reflexology boosts heart health while also relieving stress, anxiety and pain that can put the cardiovascular system at risk. 6 It is important to note that reflexology does not \"heal\" any ailments; the body repairs itself. The human body responds to touch, which can facilitate restoration on all levels. This makes reflexology a phenomenal way to supplement other natural and conventional therapies.\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb 354 | SPECIAL USEThe use of essential oils during a reflexology massage can greatly enhance its benefits. The numerous therapeutic properties of essential oils coupled with the proven uses of reflexology form a powerful combination of restorative therapy for a myriad of health challenges and conditions. If you are interested in receiving a reflexology session, there are likely several practitioners nearby. Ask around or search an online holistic practitioner directory to find one near you. Alternatively, you can start by practicing some reflexology techniques at home. The following will provide you with a step-by-step guide for using essential oils to perform a basic reflexology foot massage on a friend or a loved one. Step 1: Use a diluted essential oil or blend to massage one foot, starting clockwise on the center of the arch. Slowly increase the size of the circles and add pressure for a few minutes, and then switch to the other foot\u2014creating a balance between each foot as you go through the massage. Step 2: Press your knuckle into the center of the foot, activating the liver on the right foot and spleen on the left foot. Massage in small circles on one foot and then switch. Step 3: Use your thumbs and knuckles to massage the balls of the feet, relieving tension and pressure. Focus on one foot for a few minutes and then switch. Step 4: Unblock the control areas of the brain by pressing your knuckle or thumb into the big toe, making a downward and circular movement\u2014working the middle, base and neck of the toe. This will help to unblock emotions and relieve stress. Continue to massage each toe the same way before switching to the other foot. Step 5: Work the heel of the foot, putting pressure on the bottom center and large bones on each side of the foot. This will target the reproductive organs in both men and women and the prostate in men. Step 6: To end the massage, work the top of the feet and ankles. DEEP REFLEX FOOT MASSAGE USING ESSENTIAL OILS \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb SPECIAL USE355 If the person being massaged feels pain, reduce the pressure slightly. As the area is massaged over time, the pain will begin to minimize\u2014indicating that the massage is unblocking the area and benefiting the corresponding organ. Essential Oil Use Guide for Reflexology The best way to keep the bodily systems working properly is to massage a few major pressure points each day, applying a few drops of essential oils, either neat or diluted, with a carrier oil.

Massage therapy began as a sacred system of natural healing; however, cultural shifts rendered it little more than a form of indulgence for extensive periods of history. Thankfully, massage has experienced a resurgence in modern times. Today, massage is used as a form of holistic therapy for its ability to reduce pain, increase alertness, relieve feelings of depression and enhance immune function. Modern massage therapists practice a multitude of techniques originating from methods that are as old as time. The goal is simple\u2014to help others promote their physical and emotional well-being and experience a higher quality of life. The body of research dedicated to proving massage therapy's benefits continues to grow and has revealed that massage may: Help fight depression. A 2010 meta-analysis investigated the effects of massage therapy on depression symptoms by reviewing 17 studies containing 786 participants. All trials displayed the positive effects of touch massage when compared to control groups. 7 Aid in reducing stress. A review published in Sports Medicine states that touch massage therapy produces positive effects on recovery and muscle soreness after physical exertion or injury. 8 Alleviate pain. In 2014, 404 patients with fibromyalgia were analyzed after receiving massage therapy for at least five weeks. The meta- analyses showed that massage therapy improved pain, anxiety and depression in patients. Promote hormone balance. A study found that massage was associated with an increase in the hormone oxytocin, as well as reductions in adrenocorticotropin hormone, nitric oxide and beta-endorphin levels. Lessen systemic inflammation. A 2012 study evaluated the effects of massage on young male participants with muscle damage. Massage reduced the production of the inflammatory compounds and mitigated cellular stress. There is no shortage of massage therapists, but not all of them utilize essential oils in their therapy. Make sure to ask plenty of questions before you book a session. TOUCH MASSAGE \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb358 | SPECIAL USEIf you are interested in incorporating massage therapy into your family's health regimen, the technique below is an excellent primer to begin to understand how to give a healing massage. We've also included a brief list of oils that address specific areas of concern. Step 1: Depending on the desired effect of the massage (overall relaxation, pain relief, inflammation reduction, etc.), choose an appropriate essential oil. Create a blend or use 5 to 10 drops of one oil diluted with a teaspoon of a carrier oil. Use the following chart to determine which oils to use based on the desired benefit.TOUCH MASSAGE TECHNIQUE Benefit Essential Oils Alleviate Pain Boost ImmunityBoost MoodReduce InflammationReduce StressPeppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, ginger, thyme Ylang ylang, lavender, orange, frankincense, rose, vetiver Roman chamomile, frankincense, eucalyptus, peppermint, rosemary, turmeric Lavender, bergamot, Roman chamomile, frankincense, rose, ylang ylang Step 2: Position the recipient's body correctly, resting stomach-down on a flat, comfortable surface. Take pressure off the neck by allowing it to be straight during the massage. It should not be tilted up or pulled to one side. A pillow can also be placed under the feet to take pressure off the lower back. Step 3: Warm up the oil in your hands before applying it to the back. Start by distributing the oil over the length of the spine. Press your hands, palms down, into the back lightly and make three clockwise circles over the heart area. Then slide one hand to the bottom of the spine and the other hand to the base of the skull\u2014building a connection and sense of balance.\u00bb\u00bb \u00bb SPECIAL USE359 Step 4: The first step of massage is called effleurage; this helps to distribute the oil evenly while warming up the tissues. Standing at the recipient's head, maintain the same pressure throughout this movement and rhythmically move up and down the spine, placing your palms down side by side. Use light but firm, broad strokes, making sure to cover the entire back with oils. Step 5: Petrissage is a kneading movement that can be used with the palms, knuckles or fingertips that is designed to increase circulation. With one hand, make small circles and move up the side of the back and slide back down the spine. Repeat this three times, and then switch to the other side. The pressure should be slightly firmer than the pressure used during effleurage. Step 6: To apply more pressure, add one hand on top of the other and continue kneading up the back and back down the spine. This is called reinforced kneading, and it boosts lymphatic circulation. Step 7: Place both hands on the spine with your fingers pointing away from you. Slide one hand from the spine to the side of the back using mild pressure; repeat using the other hand. Continue this movement, working from the base of the spine up to the base of the skull. Do this three times, and then switch to the other side. Step 8: Stand at the recipient's head and place your hands, palms down, on the shoulders. Push your hands out to the points of the shoulders. Then rotate your hands and pull them to the neck, moving along the neck from top to bottom. Step 9: Grip the earlobe between your thumb and forefinger, working your fingers in small circles with gentle pressure. Slide your thumbs along the backs of the ears. Step 10: End the massage by repeating step 4\u2014moving up and down the spine with gentle pressure. Reflexology and massage are both excellent therapies that promote vitality and healing. Our lives would certainly not be complete without them, and we believe you will gain even more benefit from massage by incorporating essential oils into your therapy. The oils we recommend in this chapter are just the beginning; there is virtually no end to the combination of oils you can use in conjunction with various forms of massage therapy. \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb THERAPY362 | SPECIAL USEIn the last chapter, we discussed the benefits of two forms of massage and the use of essential oils during therapeutic bodywork. Here we introduce a truly holistic therapy that can transform your body, mind and spirit, and create deep connections between the one who provides the therapy and the recipient. In order to explain this new essential oil healing system and why it is so dear to our hearts, we'll first explain where the idea for this unique form of spiritually-based therapy originated. Jordan had been aware of essential oils for decades before they ever became an instrumental part of his life in 2008, when he was given a death sentence. Doctors told him there was a 100 percent chance he would be dead within three months from an aggressive form of metastatic cancer if he did not take the traditional cancer treatment route (chemotherapy and surgery). Jordan felt strongly that this was not the answer he needed if he wanted to survive this prognosis\u2014and that is when he made the life-changing decision to embark upon a dramatic physical, mental, emotional and spiritual healing plan that spanned 40 days. During that period of time, he spent 12 to 14 hours a day focused on diet, detoxification and body therapies, as well as engaging in a major spiritual attack on cancer. Part of Jordan's daily regimen involved a massage that was a combination of lymphatic drainage and essential oil therapy and included the use of up to a dozen or more oils at a time. The essential oil session alone lasted an hour every single day, seven days a week, for all 40 days of his healing plan. Jordan also diffused essential oils all day long throughout his home, added them to cleansing beverages, poured them on his head and rubbed oils on his feet. This multi-faceted attack that was a combination of holistic and spiritual therapies resulted in a total healing, and Jordan truly became more than a conqueror. It was a supernatural miracle, made possible by God's direct hand on Jordan and aided by natural therapies. Essential oils also became a bigger part of Dr. Josh's life after his mother's victorious battle against cancer. As a part of her natural path to cancer treatment, she received two to three lymphatic massages per week using various essential oils. There was no doubt in our minds how restorative and powerful essential oils could be. And slowly, over the course of the last decade, they have taken on more and more of a primary role in each of our lives. SPECIAL USE363 Beyond simply the healing power of oils, we believe their power also comes from their significance in Scripture. The oils and aromatics mentioned in the Bible were more valuable than gold and silver. Israel's King Hezekiah kept \"the spices, and the precious ointment\" (2 Kings 20:13) together with silver and gold in the royal treasure chamber. People and objects were anointed throughout the Bible: Aaron and his sons were anointed priests, the Tabernacle and all of its vessels were anointed before being put into service and Saul and David were anointed to be kings. It has been suggested that the holy anointing oil described in Exodus 30:23-25 is a symbol of being set apart for special purposes in God's kingdom. The Hebrew word for Messiah, Moshiach, means \"Anointed One.\" Jesus Christ was twice anointed with the oil of spikenard, which was so expensive that Judas was indignant that it wasn't sold to raise money for the poor. Psalm 45 informs us that the garments of the Messiah are fragrant with myrrh, aloes and cassia. In one translation of Philippians 4:18, Paul described gifts given as \"a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.\" In Proverbs 27:9, we are told \"ointment and perfume rejoice in the heart.\" The New Testament also suggests that incense offering represents the prayers of saints rising up to God in Heaven. There is no doubt that oils play a significant role both spiritually and therapeutically in the Bible. Now, although Jordan never formally studied the existing aromatherapy massage techniques, as he was coaching people who were having some health challenges, he was inspired to create an essential oil system that was healing to the body in a physical and spiritual sense. He soon felt led to develop a system that is based on the healing properties of essentials oils and serves as a symbolic representation of the areas of Jesus' body that bled (for us) in the hours leading up to and during the crucifixion. He called it BHW, or By His Wounds. THE BIBLICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF OILS IN ANOINTING By His Wounds (BHW) Therapy is a modern anointing system that allows you to connect to God in a meaningful, deep way. The idea is that you quite literally anoint the areas of the body where Jesus bled with special oils. This system was revealed to Jordan, in part because of the significant role essential oils played in his healing, and also because of the Biblical importance of oils themselves in anointing. There are seven key areas where the anointing occurs, with each area representing a place on Christ's body from which he bled:THE BIBLICAL ESSENTIAL OIL HEALING SYSTEM 364 | SPECIAL USESPECIAL USE365 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Feet. Jesus shed blood from his feet when a large nail or spike was driven through skin, tendon, nerve and bone in order to secure his feet to the cross\u2014a heavy price to pay for our peace. Hands. In the same manner in which his feet were nailed to the cross, so too were his hands (or perhaps his wrists). Jesus paid for our inheritance, and because of his sacrifice, we have authority in His name. Head. Jesus was mocked by Roman soldiers, who placed a crown of thorns upon his head. Matthew 27:29 tells us, \"And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\" The King of Kings could have silenced them without a word, but he endured the humiliation for us. Sides. Jesus shed blood from his side. When it was pierced, it is said that both blood and water came from Him. Some believe this is a physical symbol that his heart burst. He truly paid the price to heal the broken hearted. Chest. Jesus was beaten and bruised so severely that internal bleeding was evident under his skin, including on his chest. He bled on the inside for our iniquities. Neck. The scourging on Jesus' entire body was brutal. Scourging was a punishment so severe, humiliating and demeaning that it was reserved only for slaves and non-Romans\u2014those who were viewed as the lesser elements in Roman society. The scourging undoubtedly caused our Savior's neck and shoulders to bleed. Back. Just before His crucifixion, the Romans viciously flogged Jesus. Deuteronomy 25:3 states that a criminal should not receive more than 40 lashes. In order to avoid possibly breaking this command, the Jews would only give criminals 39 lashes, which is why many infer this is the number of lashes Jesus received. He paid for our healing by His stripes, His wounds. And by His wounds we are healed. 6. 7.The pure, perfect innocence of Jesus Christ, His wisdom and creative power, were all present in His human body. This flawless Shepherd chose to accept an undeserved, cruel death in order to save us. The Father chose to send His son to the cross, and Jesus chose to take our punishment. They conspired to save all who would believe and to show by Jesus' wounds both the seriousness of our sin and the depth of His love. BHW Therapy is one small way to show Christ that we both recognize and honor this most ultimate sacrifice, and it is also an ideal way to benefit from the therapeutic qualities of essential oils. Here are the seven basic guidelines for BHW Therapy: With the recipient lying down comfortably, anoint each area in the order presented in this section, starting with the feet and hands and then working your way down the body from the head. The last part of the body to address will be the back and spine. For this area, you will apply the oils with 39 downward motions, representing the 39 stripes Jesus received. For each part of the body, you will use a different oil. See the following table (BHW Therapy Application Chart) for our recommendations. Apply a few drops of a carrier oil and then apply three drops per oil to the area. Note that several of the oils can be applied neat if desired. Rub in the oils seven times using a circular motion (see BHW Therapy Application Chart for specific application suggestions). You can repeat the seven circular motions as many times as desired. During your BHW session, we recommend listening to worship music or the Bible on an app or CD. Third Day has a song entitled \"By His Wounds\" that is both poignant and fitting. Use light to moderate pressure, depending on the preference of the recipient. Take your time, spending anywhere from one to three minutes on each location for up to 30 minutes total.1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 366 | SPECIAL USESPECIAL USEBHW THERAPY APPLICATION CHART Location Oil Specific Application Feet Hands Head SidesLavender \u2014 Similar to what was used by Mary on Jesus' feet (spikenard). Ideal for greater intuition and clarity. Frankincense \u2014 The king of the oils. Can help us release parts of ourselves that hold us back from connecting with our soul, as well as feelings of unworthiness and insecurity. Myrrh or Rosemary \u2014 A main component in ancient anointing oil for kings. Uplifting to the mind; can relieve stress and relax the body. Rosemary oil also works well because of its neurological and anti-inflammatory benefits. Thyme \u2014 Similar to hyssop, which was used in the ceremonial cleansing of people and houses in Biblical times.Apply to both the feet and ankles. Can apply NEAT. Apply to both the hands and wrists. Can apply NEAT. Apply over the entire head, even dripping the oil onto the top of the head, much like the kings of antiquity were anointed. Can apply NEAT. Apply to one or both sides. Can apply NEAT. 367 Chest NeckBackOrange \u2014 Uplifts the heart, lends support by uplifting and promoting a positive attitude while calming the spirit. Peppermint \u2014 Can cleanse the spirit and in-crease attunement with the soul so that intuitive awareness is released. Cedarwood or Cypress \u2014 Great for spinal health. According to some sources, the cross was made of either cedar-wood or cypress wood.Apply just above the pectoral muscles. Can apply NEAT. Dilute with a carrier oil and apply to neck and tops of the shoulders. Dilute with a carrier oil and apply in a downward motion on the spine 39 times to represent the lashes Jesus received. You may have noticed that there are seven areas of the body, seven guidelines and a series of seven circular motions used during application. The reason for this is because the number seven is the foundation of God's word. The number was used 735 times in the Bible (54 times in the book of Revelation alone). Seven is the number of completeness and perfection, both physical and spiritual. It derives much of its meaning from being tied directly to God's creation of all things. Therefore, we feel it is a fitting number to bring an even greater sense of spiritual awareness to your practice. To further enrich and enhance your practice, here are seven verses that can be said at the beginning of the therapy or during application of the oils: James 5:14-15 (AMP) Is anyone among you sick? He must call for the elders (spiritual leaders) of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Isaiah 53:5 (NIV) But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. 368 | SPECIAL USESPECIAL USEPsalms 103:2-5 (NIV) Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits\u2014who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. Romans 8:11 (NLT) The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bod-ies by this same Spirit living within you. 1 Peter 2:24 (NIV) \"He himself bore our sins\" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; \"by his wounds you have been healed.\" Jeremiah 17:14 (NIV) Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for You are the one I praise. Psalm 147:3 (AMP) He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds [healing their pain and comforting their sorrow]. BHW Therapy can be carried out as a part of your weekly spiritual time with the Lord, as a great way to facilitate healing with your spouse, as a special ceremonial time with your children (young and old) or as a part of a healing regimen. We recommend performing it at least once weekly. If you are dealing with a serious issue, it is ideal to perform BHW three to seven times a week for 15 to 30 minutes at a time. The oils used can be amended to include other essential oils that may address particular issues you are facing. For example: For Hormonal Support: Clary Sage, Ylang, Roman Chamomile By practicing BHW Therapy, we are putting ourselves in a situation where we fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. We envision people engaging in BHW Therapy with their children and loved ones, and we sincerely hope it can become an incredible healing tool for you and your family. Use it consistently for phenomenal results and an awakened sense of gratitude for Jesus' ultimate sacrifice. \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb 8 PREGNANCY AND BABY CAREPregnancy is a joyful time that is also filled with an exhaustive list of unique issues ranging from overall discomfort and fatigue to nausea, constipation and insomnia. When Jordan's wife was pregnant with their first child Joshua, they incorporated essential oils into their daily regimen. They utilized a special blend of Biblical oils including frankincense, myrrh, galbanum and spikenard every morning and evening to provide a calming and soothing effect on both of them. Ty's wife, Charlene, was incredibly sick during the first trimester of all four of her pregnancies. At the time, they were unaware of how useful essential oils could be during pregnancy, and Charlene certainly wishes she had known about them back then.

The difference, however, is in the word \"tiny.\" The average adult weighs 180 pounds, while the average infant weighs in at just 7.5 pounds. For this reason, and because their skin is not mature, essential oil use in babies looks a little different than it does for the rest of us. For babies under three months of age, we recommend diffusing oils as the safest and effective tool for infant care. When using oils topically, oils should be diluted with a carrier oil and applied to the baby's back, abdomen or feet. It is a good idea to introduce one essential oil at a time, and then watch how your little one reacts to it. Look for skin irritations and any other signs of a reaction such as rashes, itching and respiratory issues. The following is a list of oils that are generally accepted as safe for use on and around infants, either diffused or applied topically in small doses:BABIES AND ESSENTIAL OILS Note: To be safe, we recommend that you gently remove ointments and salves containing essential oils with a damp, soft washcloth (no soap) just prior to breastfeeding.

While essential oils can provide you and your baby with some much needed relief during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, some general safety guidelines regarding essential oil use should be followed to ensure optimal health and protection for you and your children: Consult with a healthcare professional. Use caution during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, as the baby is developing rapidly, and always consult with your healthcare practitioner to ensure essential oil use during pregnancy is right for you. You should also consult with your child's pediatrician for any questions regarding essential oil use with infants. Use the highest quality oils. When using essential oils during pregnancy and with children, the quality of the oil is of vital importance. Only use organic, pure, therapeutic-grade oils from a brand that has received third party certifications to ensure there are no harmful substances present. Use sparingly. Use only a drop or two of essential oils on small children, FINAL THOUGHTS 381 and dilute them with a carrier oil before topical application. It is also important for pregnant women to pay extra attention to how their bodies respond to essential oil use and use only as much as is needed for the desired effect. Avoid certain oils. Some oils are generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, while others are considered to contain properties that could harm the mother or fetus during pregnancy. This includes, but is not limited to, emmenagogue and abortifacient essential oils, as they have the ability to stimulate contractions and encourage blood flow in the uterus. A few specific oils that are not generally recommended for use during pregnancy include: Cinnamon, clove, rosemary and clary contractionsHyssop\u2014exhibits abortifacient qualitiesFennel\u2014encourages estrogen productionWintergreen\u2014contains a chemical (methyl salicylate) that may cause allergic reactions and is toxic when ingested For a more complete list of which oils to avoid during pregnancy, check the specific safety considerations for each single oil in Part II. Remember: when in doubt, diffuse. The safest way to use oils during pregnancy is to diffuse five to seven drops in order to promote peace and boost energy. If you are interested in using oils internally during pregnancy in small doses, only do so after consulting with your physician. It's important for expectant and breastfeeding mothers to remember to listen to their own bodies and also consult with a health professional regarding their unique circumstances to best determine whether or not a specific oil is right for them. Virtually anything can become toxic at high levels, which makes proper dosage with any medicine, salve, ointment or remedy\u2014including essential oils\u2014important.

Making your own natural cleaning recipes is not time-consuming or expensive. In fact, quite the opposite is true. In less time than it takes to run to the supermarket to buy conventional cleaning supplies, you can fill up a spray bottle with vinegar and water, add a few drops of essential oils, and clean your appliances and all of the glass in your home. Believe it or not, you can also save a lot of money. The price of commercial cleaners can range from $5 to $8 dollars or more, and let's not forget that a bottle of store-bought laundry detergent can cost as much as $20! A natural alternative, on the other hand, can cost pennies to make. While high-quality essential oils are relatively expensive, they are also highly potent. That means you can use just 5 to 30 drops of an oil (depending on the formula) to make an entire bottle of cleaner than can last for months. Other all-natural ingredients such as vinegar, baking soda, water and castile soap are also inexpensive. You will be amazed at the amount of \"necessary\" products you can throw away altogether. According to the book Toxic Free by Debra Lynn Dadd, the average kitchen contains 30 or more commercial products! Many of the essential oil-based formulas in this book are multipurpose, so you can ditch all those unnecessary specialty products and simplify your life. See Part V for more DIY recipes and enjoy a clean, green and less toxic home. 390 | SPECIAL USECleaner Directions SPECIAL USECHAPTER 11 NATURAL PET CAREAmerica has a love affair with pets\u2014and why wouldn't we? Our furry friends can bring so much joy, fun and happiness into our lives. Dr. Josh and Chelsea have two dogs named Oakley and Flash. They use essential oils with them on a regular basis. They use a blend of lemongrass, rosemary and geranium to repel fleas and ticks and wash their dogs' hair with a homemade shampoo made with rosemary, Roman chamomile and aloe vera gel. Dr. Josh will also often rub frankincense oil on the hips of their dog Oakley to prevent hip pain. Jordan and his team at Heal the Planet Farm have used herbs and oils effectively to naturally treat a wide variety of animals, including livestock and guard animals. The Bollingers own a German shepherd named Grizzly and about a dozen cats that roam their 15 acres. After one of their cats was attacked and severely injured by a neighbor's dog, Charlene actually used a homeopathic remedy (Arnica Montana) to help nurse the feline back to health. The cat, aptly named Miracle, made a full recovery. We love our pets\u2014and we also love the fact that we can use the same gentle, natural supplements on them that we use on our human family. When taken in conjunction with your vet's recommended treatments, essential oils can be used on pets as a natural remedy for a variety of health issues. Essential oils can even be used in combination with medications in order to reduce potential side effects from drugs. It is important for a pet to receive an accurate diagnosis from a veterinarian when health issues are worsening over a short period of time. Together with your veterinarian, you can decide on the best treatment options. 392 | SPECIAL USE SPECIAL USE393 Recommended Essential Oils for Pets Here is a list of essential oils that are safe for most pets.

TIPS FOR TREATING PETS WITH ESSENTIAL OILS Essential oils contain a host of biologically active and powerful compounds that when used correctly are an indispensible part of integrative medical care for humans and pets alike. However, they can cause undesirable side effects in animals as well as people, which is why a few precautions must be taken: Always dilute. Just like when using essential oils on children, the dilution ratio you use depends on the weight of the pet. Smaller pets should only 396 | SPECIAL USEbe given diluted essential oils; use 2 tablespoons of coconut oil to 1 to 2 drops of essential oils for pets under 30 pounds. For pets over 30 pounds, a 1:1 ratio is recommended (1 tablespoon of coconut oil for 1 to 2 drops of essential oils). Perform patch testing. Smaller pets or certain breeds may be more sensitive to essential oils. For this reason, it is important to do a patch test first. Apply 1 to 2 drops, diluted with coconut oil, to the pet's feet and monitor his or her reactions. Watch for intolerance. Check for irritation or indication of GI upset, itchiness, redness or inflammation. As an added precaution, do not use essential oils on animals that are pregnant, under three months old, ill or epileptic. Some common signs of essential oil intolerance or toxicity in pets include: Change in sleeping or eating patterns/habitsBehavior changes, such as fatigue, lack of energy, not wanting to play, confusion or lightheadedness Digestive conditions, such as vomiting, constipation or diarrhea Muscle tremorsIncreased salivation or drooling Use only the highest quality oils. Since pets are part of our families, we require the same level of quality in our oils for them as we do for our loved ones. Ensure you are using only 100 percent pure, organic oils that have received third party certifications to ensure there are no harmful substances present within the oils. Essential oils can help your pets look and feel their best\u2014and they can save you money! Flea and tick shampoo and other pet care items can really be pricey, so save yourself time and money by skipping the big box pet stores and making your own pet care home remedies.\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb SPECIAL USE397 PART V ESSENTIAL ORANGE CINNAMON PANCAKES CINNAMON VANILLA SMOOTHIECINNAMON VANILLA SMOOTHIE TIME: 2 MINUTES SERVES: 1-2 8 ounces milk \u00bd cup ice1-2 scoops vanilla whey protein powder1 drop cinnamon essential oil DIRECTIONS 1.
