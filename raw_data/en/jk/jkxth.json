This Act amends the Animal Agriculture Compliance Act (Iowa Code chapter 459), which generally authorizes the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to regulate confinement feeding operations (operations) including associated structures and the use of manure originating from the operation. Generally, these regulations apply differently depending on the operation's size, determined by calculating its animal unit capacity (AUC), which is the maximum number of animal units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one time. Each category of animal is assigned an equivalency factor and a category may be subdivided into subcategories based on the animal's weight. The equivalency factor for each category or subcategory is multiplied by the number of head maintained as part of the operation. AUC FOR FISHES. The Act provides that when calculating an operation's AUC, fishes weighing less than 25 grams are assigned a new equivalency factor of 0.00006. Fishes weighing 25 grams or more retain their current assigned equivalency factor of 0.001. ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES. A person who violates an air quality or water quality regulation is subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 enforced in an administrative action brought by DNR (Iowa Code section 459.602, referring to Iowa Code section 455B.109). A person who violates a water quality regulation may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 enforced in a court action brought by the Attorney General (Iowa Code section 459.603, referring to Iowa Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).

HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2340 2340 2340 - - - Fences Fences Fences and and and Fence Fence Fence Viewers Viewers Viewers BY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE. This Act amends provisions in Iowa's fence law (Iowa Code chapter 359A) that in part governs the construction (erection) or maintenance of fences existing on the property boundary between land of adjoining owners, sometimes referred to as \"partition fences.\" A controversy between the owners may result in an order being issued by the board of trustees of the township where the property boundary is located, who assume the title of \"fence viewers\" (Iowa Code sections 359A.3 through 359A.11 and Iowa Code section 359A.22). The fence viewers serve as adjudicators by determining the obligations, rights, and duties of the respective parties, including contributions (payments), which must be set forth in an order. Any costs incurred by the fence viewers in carrying out an order are assessed and collected as ordinary taxes (Iowa Code section 359A.6). CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. The Act provides for a fence viewer who has a conflict of interest involving any question related to the controversy. If the fence viewer may have a conflict of interest, the fence viewer must make disclosure of the possible conflict of interest to the parties and other fence viewers. If the fence viewer has an actual conflict of interest, the fence viewer must be disqualified either at the fence viewer's election or by vote of the other trustees. Either action must be described in the fence viewers' notice to the parties and order. If the trustee is disqualified, the remaining trustees must appoint a substitute (unless the township clerk selects fence viewers in cases in which no trustee is remaining). The Act provides that the fence viewer may participate in the matter if the parties to the controversy are notified of the conflict and sign a waiver. ERECTION OF FENCES BASED ON A DETERMINATION OF UNFEASIBILITY. The Act provides that the fence viewers may determine that the erection of a fence on the property boundary between the adjoining properties is unfeasible pursuant to a site evaluation conducted by the fence viewers. In that case, the trustees must assist the parties in reaching an agreement or, if that fails, take account of the land's characteristics in the order.

This Act applies to a grocery store that participates as a vendor in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in conjunction with the Iowa Department of Public Health (department). Generally, standards for the commercial production and marketing of eggs (by egg-laying hens) are established by several federal agencies including the USDA (21 U.S.C. \u00a71031 et seq.). 4 AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURE Under the Act, if a grocery store maintains an inventory of specialty eggs for retail sale it must also maintain an inventory of conventional eggs (shell eggs that are not considered specialty eggs) for sale. Specialty eggs are described as having been produced by chickens advertised as having been housed in a cage-free, free-range, or enriched colony cage environment. The Act requires the department to implement, administer, and enforce its provisions, including by: (1) adopting rules in consultation with the Department of Inspections and Appeals, and (2) applying for a waiver from the USDA in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship if needed. The Act does not require a grocery store to: (1) stock eggs if it does not stock specialty eggs for sale or (2) stock conventionally produced eggs for sale if it had not stocked such eggs for sale prior to January 1, 2018.

This Act concerns alcoholic beverage control and matters under the purview of the Alcoholic Beverages Division of the Department of Commerce. The Act adds a definition for \"brewpub,\" which means a commercial establishment authorized to sell beer at retail for consumption on or off the premises that is operated by a retail class \"C\" liquor control licensee or class \"B\" beer permittee who also holds a special class \"A\" beer permit to manufacture and sell beer; amends the definition of \"broker\" to provide that it also applies to a person who represents or promotes alcoholic liquor on behalf of a holder of a manufacturer's license or a class \"A\" native distilled spirits license; and amends the definition of \"alcoholic liquor\" by striking the alternative term \"intoxicating liquor.\" The Act further replaces the term \"alcoholic liquor\" for \"intoxicating liquor\" wherever the term appears in Iowa Code chapter 123 (Alcoholic Beverage Control). The Act also substitutes the defined term \"alcoholic beverage\" for the terms \"beer, wine, and alcoholic liquor\" in several provisions in Iowa Code chapter 123. The term \"alcoholic beverage\" is currently defined to include beer, wine, and alcoholic liquor. The Act provides that the consumption of any alcoholic beverages on the premises of the state-owned warehouse is prohibited with the exception of alcoholic liquor that is consumed for sampling purposes. The Iowa Code section relating to the delivery of liquor purchased from class \"E\" liquor control license holders by certain liquor control licensees is amended to include class \"C\" native distilled spirits and class \"D\" liquor control licensees. The Act authorizes a class \"C\" liquor control licensee to also hold a special class \"A\" beer permit for the purpose of operating a brewpub. Concerning a broker's permit, the Act provides that the broker list on the application for a permit shall list all manufacturers, distillers, and importers the applicant will represent and the applicant is further required to keep the list updated. The Act provides that a distiller or brewer is prohibited from providing gifts of alcoholic beverages to the Alcoholic Beverages Commission and Employees of the Alcoholic Beverages Division. The Act provides that a holder of a special class \"A\" beer permit may operate as a brewpub and that the authority of the permit is limited. The Act also specifies how a class \"B\" beer permit holder may operate as a brewpub. Iowa Code section 123.186, concerning federal regulation adopted as rules, is amended to provide that a licensee or permittee who violates a rule adopted pursuant to the Iowa Code section is guilty of a violation of the Iowa Code section and subject to the general penalties provided in Iowa Code chapter 123 and the suspension, revocation, and civil penalty provisions of Iowa Code section 123.39. The Iowa Code section concerning direct shipment of wine is amended. The Act changes the wine direct shipper license to a permit and replaces the alcohol carrier license with a wine carrier permit.

The division strikes a provision permitting a person committed as a sexually violent predator under Iowa Code chapter 229A (Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators) to be released from a secure facility or a transitional release program without supervision. Currently, a committed person may be released with or without supervision. Currently, if a committed person absconds from the transitional release program, the court is required to set a hearing within five days of the committed person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a violation occurred. The division strikes the five-day requirement and instead requires the court to schedule a hearing after receiving notice that the committed person has been returned to the secure facility. Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a committed person should be discharged from the Sexually Violent Predator Program, the court may release the committed person with or without supervision prior to such discharge, if the court determines it is in the best interest of the community. Under the division, if the court or jury has determined that a committed person should be released from a secure facility or a transitional release program, but the court has determined the committed person suffers from a mental abnormality and it is in the best interest of the community, the court shall release the committed person with supervision prior to discharge. Currently, DHS is the only designated agency that is not liable for the acts of a committed person released with supervision. Under the division, if a committed person is released with supervision, the division specifies that a judicial district of Department of Correctional Services shall not be held liable for any acts of the committed person. If a person is released with supervision, and the person absconds in violation of the release plan, the division strikes the requirement that a hearing be held within five days of the committed person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a violation occurred and instead requires the court to schedule a hearing after the committed person has been returned to a secure facility. The division also provides that child abuse includes a person who is responsible for the care of a child knowingly allowing another person custody of, control over, or unsupervised access to a child under the age of 14 or a child with a physical or mental disability, after knowing the other person is required to register or is on the Sex Offender Registry. The division provides exceptions for a child living with a parent or guardian who is a sex offender required to register or on the Sex Offender Registry, a child living with a parent or guardian who is married to and living with a sex offender required to register or on the Sex Offender Registry, and a child who is a sex offender required to register or on the Sex Offender Registry who is living with the child's parent, guardian, or foster parent and is also living with the child to whom access was allowed.

Division XX \u2014 State Training School \u2014 Eldora This division relates to the state training school at Eldora. Under current law, \"state training school\" is defined to include units for juvenile delinquents located at Eldora and Toledo. The division amends the definition of \"state training school\" to eliminate references to Toledo and makes conforming changes. Division XXI \u2014 Geriatric Patient Housing Review This division requires IDA and the departments of Human Services, Inspections and Appeals, and Corrections during the 2018 Legislative Interim to cooperatively review issues and develop policy recommendations relating to housing for geriatric persons including geriatric individuals on the Sex Offender Registry or who are sexually aggressive. The agencies are directed to submit a joint report with recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly by December 15, 2018. Division XXII \u2014 Wrongful Birth or Wrongful Life Cause of Action This division relates to causes of action for wrongful birth and wrongful life. The division prohibits a cause of action and the awarding of damages on behalf of a person, based on a wrongful birth claim that, but for an act or omission of the defendant, a child would not or should not have been born. The division also prohibits a cause of action and the awarding of damages on behalf of any person, based on a wrongful life claim that, but for an act or omission of the defendant, the person bringing the action would not or should not have been born. The prohibitions apply to any claim regardless of whether the child is born healthy or with a birth defect or disorder or other adverse medical condition. However, the division does not apply to a civil action for damages for an intentional or grossly negligent act or omission, including any act or omission that constitutes a public offense, or to a civil action for damages for the intentional failure of a physician to comply with the duty imposed by licensure to provide a patient with all information reasonably necessary to make decisions about a pregnancy. The division took effect June 1, 2018, and applies to a cause of action that accrues on or after the effective date of the division. A cause of action that accrues before June 1, 2018, is governed by the law applicable to such a cause of action prior to that date. The division, in part, is a response to the Iowa Supreme Court's decision in Plowman v. Fort Madison Community Hospital , No. 15-0974 (June 2, 2017), holding, in part, that a wrongful birth action fits within common law tort principles governing medical negligence claims. Division XXIII \u2014 Transfer of Funds Between DHS Institutions This division requires DHS to report any transfer made during a fiscal quarter by the Director of DHS between appropriations made to the institutions under the purview of the department, that are not subject to prior written consent and approval of the Governor and the Department of Management, to the Legislative Services Agency within 30 days of the beginning of the subsequent fiscal quarter.

APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATIONS 31 Division IX \u2014 Alcohol This division relates to alcohol regulation by modifying provisions concerning liquor control licenses and open containers of alcoholic liquor, wine, and beer.

The Act also provides that the Alcoholic Beverages Division may issue a class \"E\" liquor control license for premises covered by a license or permit authorizing on-premises consumption if the premises is a grocery store that is at least 5,000 square feet. In addition, the Act provides that a liquor control licensee authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption, or a class \"B\" beer permittee, may permit a customer to carry an open container of wine, alcoholic liquor, or beer, as applicable to the licensee or permittee, into another immediately adjacent licensed premises, temporary closed public right-of-way, or private property. Division X \u2014 Sexually Violent Predators Currently, a final hearing on the status of a person committed as a sexually violent predator shall be held if the committed person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that such a final hearing should be held to determine either the mental abnormality of the committed person has so changed that the person is not likely to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent offenses or the committed person is suitable for placement in a transitional release program. If the committed person proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a final hearing should be held, prior law requires the court to set the final hearing within 60 days of that determination. After the court's determination that a final hearing should be held, this division permits the committed person to waive the requirement that a final hearing be held within 60 days of the court's determination; however, the committed person or the attorney for the committed person may reassert a demand that a final hearing be held within 60 days from the date of filing the demand with the clerk of the district court. The division specifies that any medical or treatment reports of the committed person or victim impact statements which have been submitted to the court or admitted into evidence under seal shall be made available to the prosecuting attorney, attorney general, committed person, or attorney for the committed person without a court order.

Upon a finding of an independent administrative law judge, the division specifies that an inmate committed to the department may be ordered to forfeit any or all earned time if the inmate has failed to complete a sex offender or domestic abuse treatment program. Division XII \u2014 Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements This division amends Iowa Code section 513D.1, as enacted by SF 2349(5) (see Business, Banking, and Insurance), to allow a multiple employer welfare arrangement that is recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(9), and that is registered with the Commissioner of Insurance prior to January 1, 2018, to elect to be treated as an association health plan as established by the commissioner. 32 APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATIONS Division XIII \u2014 Self-Promotion \u2014 Public Funds This division relates to the usage of public funds and funds held in a private trust fund to pay for certain advertisements.

This limitation does not apply to ministerial or ceremonial records, or to ordinary constituent correspondence. The Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board or the relevant legislative ethics committee shall impose a civil penalty equal to the amount of funds expended in contravention to the division on any person who violates the division.

Division XVI \u2014 Local Ordinances Previously, cities and counties were prohibited from adopting ordinances, motions, resolutions, or amendments that set standards or requirements regarding the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise that are different from, or in addition to, any requirement established by state law. This division limits the prohibition to standards or requirements regarding the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise that are different from, or in addition to, any state law. Division XVII \u2014 Health Care Coverage \u2014 Surviving Spouse and Children This division requires a city, county, or the state that has procured accident or health care coverage for its employees to permit continuation of existing coverage for the surviving spouse and children of a peace officer or fire fighter who died and to whom a line of duty death benefit is payable under Iowa Code chapter 97A, 97B, or 411.

The division provides the Department of Revenue with administration and enforcement authority over the moneys and credits tax. Division XX \u2014 Military Installation \u2014 School Enrollment This division provides that a child who lives with the child's parent or guardian, which parent or guardian is on active duty in the military service of the United States and is stationed at and resides or is domiciled within a federal military installation located contiguous to a county in this state, is considered a resident of the state and may enroll in a school district in this state, free of tuition.

Division XXV \u2014 Revocation of Driver's License for Drug-Related Convictions This division strikes provisions requiring a court to order the Department of Transportation to revoke a defendant's driver's license for 180 days if the defendant is sentenced for a controlled substance violation.

APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION AS ATHLETE AGENT. Iowa Code section 9A.104 is amended to provide that an individual may act as an athlete agent, except for signing an agency contract, if a student athlete or a person acting on the athlete's behalf initiates communication with the individual and the individual submits an application for registration as an athlete agent in this state not later than seven days after an initial act that requires the individual to register. Iowa Code section 9A.105 is stricken and rewritten.

The Secretary of State can consider not only whether an applicant has been convicted of a crime that would involve moral turpitude or be a felony, but whether the applicant has pleaded guilty or no contest to such a crime. The Secretary of State can also consider whether an applicant has engaged in conduct resulting in imposition of a sanction, suspension, or declaration of ineligibility to participate in an interscholastic, intercollegiate, or professional athletic event on a student athlete or a sanction on an educational institution. Iowa Code section 9A.107, concerning suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew registration of an athlete agent, is amended to allow the Secretary of State to also limit such registration.

The agent is also prohibited from failing to notify a student athlete, or a minor athlete's parent or guardian, before signing an agency contract for a particular sport that signing the contract may make the student athlete ineligible to participate as a student athlete in that sport. ACTIONS AGAINST AN ATHLETE AGENT. Iowa Code section 9A.116 is amended to provide that an educational institution or a student athlete may bring an action for damages against an athlete agent if the institution or athlete is adversely affected by an act or omission of the agent in violation of Iowa Code chapter 9A. Iowa Code section 9A.116 is also amended to provide that a plaintiff who prevails in an action under the Iowa Code section may recover actual damages, and costs and reasonable attorney fees.

This Act modifies various provisions applicable to consumer security freezes and personal information security breach protection. CONSUMER SECURITY FREEZES. The Act expands the methods permitted for a consumer to submit a request for a security freeze to a consumer reporting agency to allow such requests to be submitted via first-class mail, telephone, secure Internet connection, or other secure electronic contact method designated by the consumer reporting agency. The Act reduces the number of days by which a consumer reporting agency must commence a security freezing after receiving a request from five to three business days. The Act also reduces the number of days by which a consumer reporting agency must send written confirmation to a consumer after commencing a security freeze from 10 to 3 business days. This provision of the Act takes effect January 1, 2019. The Act provides that if a consumer requests a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on a nationwide basis, the consumer reporting agency shall identify, to the best of its knowledge, any other consumer reporting agency that does the same and inform consumers of appropriate contact information that would permit the consumer to place, lift, or remove a security freeze from the other consumer reporting agency. This provision of the Act takes effect January 1, 2019. The Act requires consumer reporting agencies to develop procedures to expedite the receipt and processing of temporary security freeze suspension requests received via the same methods permitted for consumers to submit security freeze requests. The Act requires a consumer reporting agency to comply with a temporary security freeze suspension request received via secure Internet connection or other secure electronic contact method designated BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BANKING, BANKING, BANKING, AND AND AND INSURANCE INSURANCE INSURANCE 41 by the consumer reporting agency, or telephone, within 15 minutes after receiving the request.

PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY BREACH PROTECTION. The Act expands the definition of \"encryption\" as applicable in Iowa Code chapter 715C to specify that \"encryption\" means the use of an algorithmic process pursuant to accepted industry standards. The Act provides that Iowa Code section 715C.2, relating to personal information security breach notification requirements and remedies, does not apply to a person who is subject to and complies with certain provisions in the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. Iowa Code section 715C.2(8) requires any person who owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information subject to a security breach to more than 500 Iowa residents to give written notice of the security breach to the Attorney General. The Act removes the requirement that such notice to the Attorney General be provided following the discovery of the security breach or receipt of notification of the security breach. SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2257 2257 2257 - - - Marketplace Marketplace Marketplace Contractors Contractors Contractors BY COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE. This Act relates to marketplace contractors.

However, \"marketplace contractor\" does not include a person or entity that performs services relating to courier delivery. The Act defines \"marketplace platform\" to mean a person or entity that operates a digital network to connect marketplace contractors to individuals or entities that seek to obtain services offered by marketplace contractors. The Act provides that a marketplace contractor shall be treated as an independent contractor, and not an employee of a marketplace platform, for all purposes under state or local law if the following conditions occur: the parties agree in writing that the marketplace contractor is an independent contractor and not an employee of the marketplace platform; the marketplace platform does not unilaterally prescribe specific hours for the marketplace contractor to be available to accept requests; the marketplace contractor is not prohibited from engaging in outside employment or performing services through other marketplace platforms; and the marketplace contractor bears its own expenses. For services performed by a marketplace contractor prior to July 1, 2018, a marketplace contractor shall be treated as an independent contractor if the conditions set forth in the Act were satisfied at the time the services were performed. The Act provides that a marketplace contractor shall be responsible for obtaining an Iowa license when providing services that require licensure. The Act does not apply to services performed by an individual in the employ of a government entity or Indian tribe; services performed by an individual in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational, or other organization; or services performed by a licensed real estate broker or real estate salesperson.

This Act makes changes to statutes involving corporations operating on a for-profit basis under Iowa Code chapter 490 (the Iowa Business Corporation Act) or Iowa Code chapter 491 (Corporations for Pecuniary Profit), or on a nonprofit basis under Iowa Code chapter 504 (the Revised Iowa Nonprofit Corporation Act). Current Iowa Code chapter 504, enacted in 1989, was preceded by Iowa Code chapter 504A (the Iowa Nonprofit Corporation Act) and, prior to that, the former version of Iowa Code chapter 504. A 42 BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BANKING, BANKING, BANKING, AND AND AND INSURANCE INSURANCE INSURANCE domestic corporation incorporated under Iowa Code chapter 501A (Cooperative Associations Act) is subject to current Iowa Code chapter 504 (Iowa Code section 504.1701). Earlier, a corporation \"existing under\" former Iowa Code chapter 504 was \"subject to\" Iowa Code chapter 504A (Iowa Code section 504A.100). Both of those Iowa Code chapters were repealed. NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS \u2014 RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL LAND HOLDINGS. The Act amends Iowa Code chapter 9H, which restricts certain business entities, including corporations, from acquiring agricultural land suitable for use in farming (Iowa Code section 9H.1(2) and (14)). The Act also amends related provisions in Iowa Code chapter 10B that require such entities to file agricultural landholding reports with the Secretary of State. Specifically, the Act replaces language defining a nonprofit corporation as a business entity \"organized under\" former Iowa Code chapter 504 or current Iowa Code chapter 504 with language that adopts by reference the definition of a corporation as set forth in current Iowa Code chapter 504, including a domestic nonprofit corporation incorporated under its provisions and a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state (Iowa Code sections 504.141 and 504.119). The Act also makes the same change to another provision in Iowa Code chapter 9H that allows a domestic nonprofit corporation to acquire agricultural land for research or experimental purposes (Iowa Code section 9H.4(1)). CORPORATIONS FOR PECUNIARY PROFIT \u2014 DIRECTOR'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY EXCEPTION \u2014 IOWA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT. The Act provides that in the case of a corporation organized under Iowa Code chapter 491, a director's \"conflict of interest transaction\" is subject to the same requirements as provided for a corporation organized under and therefore subject to Iowa Code chapter 490 (Iowa Code sections 490.860 through 490.863). The Act also allows a director of a corporation organized under and subject to Iowa Code chapter 491 to use the \"business opportunity\" exception according to the same requirements that apply to a director of a corporation organized under and subject to Iowa Code chapter 490 (Iowa Code section 490.870). NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS SUBJECT TO REVISED IOWA NONPROFIT CORPORATION ACT \u2014 STANDARD OF LIABILITY FOR DIRECTORS \u2014 BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY EXCEPTION. The Act provides that for a plaintiff to move forward in a legal or equitable action alleging a director is liable for violating the duty of care owed to the nonprofit corporation, the plaintiff must establish that the director's liability is not precluded by the director having acted under the business opportunity exception if such a defense is raised (\"interposed as a bar to the proceeding\") (Iowa Code sections 504.832 and 504.836).

SMALL GROUP HEALTH COVERAGE. The bill would have changed the definition of \"eligible employee\" in Iowa Code section 513B.2 to specify that a W-2 wage and tax statement was not required to qualify as an eligible employee and the definition of \"small employer\" would have been broadened to include a self-employed individual, a limited liability company, a partner of a partnership, an S corporation, a C corporation, or an independent contractor that does not employ an eligible employee.

The Act requires the Commissioner of Insurance to adopt rules that allow for the creation of association health plans that are consistent with the final regulation to be issued by the United States Department of Labor and codified in 29 C.F.R. pt. 2510. The comment period for the department's proposed regulation closed on March 6, 2018. The proposed regulation broadens the criteria under Title I of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to allow an employer to form an association solely for the purpose of sponsoring a group health plan for its employer members. Currently, employer groups are prohibited from forming associations for the sole purpose of providing group health coverage. The commissioner is authorized to enforce the Act. The Act amends Iowa Code section 507A.4, exempting some transactions from unauthorized insurer sanctions, to update the exemption language regarding multiple employer welfare arrangements. The Act amends Iowa Code section 509.1 to allow a group health insurance policy sponsored by an association health plan pursuant to the Act to be delivered in the state. AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION HEALTH PLANS. The Act provides that a health benefit plan sponsored by a nonprofit agricultural organization for its members is not insurance and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Insurance if the health benefit plan meets the requirements in the Act, including that it provides dues-paying members in all 99 counties with membership opportunities and that it be administered by a domestic third-party administrator that has acted as the third-party administrator of health care administrative services for the nonprofit agricultural organization for more than 10 consecutive years. The nonprofit agricultural organization must certify its compliance with the requirements of the Act with the commissioner prior to providing a health benefit plan to its members.

This Act amends provisions in Iowa Code chapter 490, the Iowa Business Corporation Act, that in part governs the board of directors of a public corporation (board), including the directors' terms of office. SPECIAL REQUIREMENT \u2014 STAGGERED TERMS. In 2011, a special requirement applied to the terms of office for the directors of a public corporation, unless the board elected to opt out of those requirements by a date certain. The special requirement provided that a public corporation must divide its directors into three equal groups (referred to as \"classes\"). The directors were then required to serve staggered three-year terms. The board was required to amend its articles of incorporation (articles) in order to comply with the special requirement. See 2011 Iowa Acts, chapter 2, and Iowa Code section 490.806A, which in part superseded Iowa Code sections 490.805 and 490.806. SUPERCEDING REQUIREMENT. The Act provides that beginning January 1, 2019, the shareholders of the public corporation governed under the special requirement must elect all directors whose three-year terms are expiring for one-year terms, unless the public corporation has adopted the ordinary staggered term method under Iowa Code section 490.806. ELIMINATION OF THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENT. On January 1, 2022, the Act eliminates a majority of the provisions that allowed for the special requirement and effectively restores the provisions in Iowa Code chapter 490 as they existed prior to the 2011 Act. The one surviving provision defines a public corporation. The provision existing prior to the 2011 Act referenced the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) which is no longer in existence. The Act provides that a public corporation's articles survive the repeals of the relevant Iowa Code sections. EFFECTIVE DATES. The provisions of the Act take effect July 1, 2018, except for the provision allowing directors to serve one-year terms, which takes effect January 1, 2019. 44 BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BANKING, BANKING, BANKING, AND AND AND INSURANCE INSURANCE INSURANCE SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2400 2400 2400 - - - Municipal Municipal Municipal Risk Risk Risk Protection Protection Protection BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS.

HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2232 2232 2232 - - - Mortgage Mortgage Mortgage Releases Releases Releases BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. This Act relates to mortgage releases. The Act strikes Iowa Code section 535B.11(5), leaving Iowa Code chapter 655 as the sole standard and set of remedies applicable to mortgage releases. The Act requires that within 30 days of a mortgagor fully paying off a mortgage, a mortgagee must execute, acknowledge, and record a written instrument of satisfaction referring to the mortgage. The Act provides that if the mortgage secures a revolving line of credit, future advances, or other future obligations, the mortgagee is not required to file a satisfaction upon payment in full unless the mortgagor makes a written request to the mortgagee that the mortgage be released and, if such written request is made, the mortgagee shall file the release within 30 days after payment in full or after the request is made, whichever occurs later. The Act amends Iowa Code section 655.3, the provision concerning penalty for failure to discharge, to establish a penalty of $500 and to allow reasonable attorney fees to be awarded in addition to rather than included in, actual damages, where a mortgagee, or a mortgagee's personal representative or assignee, upon full performance of the conditions of the mortgage, fails to discharge such mortgage as set forth in Iowa Code section 655.1. The Act eliminates an authorization that provides that if the defendant is not a resident of this state, such action may be maintained upon the expiration of 30 days after the conditions of the mortgage have been performed, without such previous request of tender. The Act increases the penalty established in Iowa Code section 655.5 from $100 to $500 if a mortgagee fails to file a satisfaction of judgment within 30 days of receiving a written request. The Act creates Iowa Code section 655.6 to provide that a mortgagee is not liable for failure to discharge if all of the following circumstances are present: the mortgagee established reasonable procedures to achieve compliance with its obligations under Iowa Code section 655.3; the mortgagee complied with that procedure in good faith; and the mortgagee was unable to comply with its obligations because of circumstances beyond its control.

The Act repeals Iowa Code section 26.13, concerning the early release of retained funds in Iowa Code chapter 26 (Public Construction Bidding) and enacts a new Iowa Code section in Iowa Code chapter 573 (Labor and Material on Public Improvements) that has the same language, except for corrected internal references. The Act amends the provisions of the Iowa Code governing competitive bids for public improvement projects and highway and waterway contracts to no longer require the procedures set forth in the Iowa Code section concerning the early release of retained funds in Iowa Code chapter 26. MECHANIC'S LIENS. Under prior law, a lien statement could only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice, except as to the amount demanded. The Act provides that a lien statement may only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded. An amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished through the Mechanics' Notice and Lien Registry. Under the Act, amending a lien statement to decrease the amount demanded does not affect its priority. PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS. Prior Iowa Code section 573.15 in Iowa Code chapter 573 (Labor and Material on Public Improvements) provided an exception to the requirement that a public corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception provided that a public corporation need only retain funds due a supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types of notice after the materials are supplied. The Act amends Iowa Code section 573.15 to provide that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The Act also amends the notice requirement to provide that a supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a general contractor must give only one type of notice, along with a certified statement that such notice was received by the principal contractor. The exception does not apply to highway, bridge, or culvert projects as referred to in the new section of the Iowa Code governing the early release of retained funds.

BLUE SKY LAW \u2014 GENERAL. The Act amends provisions included in the Iowa Uniform Securities Act which is referred to as the Blue Sky Law (Iowa Code chapter 502). Generally, a person is prohibited from offering to sell or selling a security in this state unless it is: (1) registered with the division, (2) exempt from registration, or (3) a federal covered security regulated under federal law (Iowa Code section 502.301). The Act amends provisions that are closely connected to two federal statutes: the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Iowa Code section 502.103) as administered by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC works in close cooperation with several private entities including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a not-for-profit organization recognized by federal statute to regulate broker-dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase and sale of securities for their own account or for the account of another person. BLUE SKY LAW \u2014 CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION. The Act strikes references to the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) which was a self-regulatory organization and has been succeeded by FINRA. BLUE SKY LAW \u2014 INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING. The term \"crowdfunding\" refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures (e.g., startups and early stage companies) by an issuer attracting investments generally from small contributors purchasing an equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) from an offering via the Internet. This practice is exempt from certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration of securities (Iowa Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the filing of sales and advertising literature (Iowa Code section 502.504) so long as the offer is conducted through an \"intermediary\" which includes a broker-dealer subject to a registration requirement (Iowa Code section 502.401), and any other entity that satisfies certain requirements. The Act revises the definition of an \"intermediary,\" other than a broker-dealer, to include a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) is registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) is a member of FINRA (17 C.F.R. \u00a7227.400). The Act also rewrites a part of the definition which recognized an \"Iowa crowdfunding portal\" as an intermediary. Prior to the Act, this included a person who: (1) was registered with the division, (2) was organized under state law or authorized to do business in this state, (3) was engaged exclusively in intrastate crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this state through an Internet site, and (4) did not operate or facilitate a secondary market in securities. The Act provides that an Iowa crowdfunding portal is no longer required to be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. The Act also increases the aggregate amount of securities that may be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an intermediary during the months prior to the date of an offer or sale from $1 million to $5 million. BLUE SKY LAW \u2014 REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES. The Act updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC form \"D,\" a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. \u00a7239.500), and an associated fee are required to be filed with the division. The federal National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-290) amended the Securities Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred to as \"covered securities\" which when sold by a licensed broker-dealer is no longer subject to state registration but may be subject to notice BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BUSINESS, BANKING, BANKING, BANKING, AND AND AND INSURANCE INSURANCE INSURANCE 47 filings at the state level so long as the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. \u00a777r). VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS \u2014 CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION. The Act amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a person may be immune from liability for an offense involving a fraudulent viatical settlement act if the person, acting in good faith, sends or receives information from NASD. The Act changes that organization to FINRA. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES. The Act amends the Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services Act (Iowa Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death. The Act provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a buyer is no longer required to comply with the statute's audit requirements. The requirement for an audit performed by a certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process of review referred to as an agreed-upon procedures engagement and accompanying report. In addition, the division may waive this requirement based on good cause (Iowa Code section 523A.207). A purchase agreement is defined as an agreement to furnish cemetery merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Iowa Code section 523A.102).

If a health care service is delivered by telehealth, it must be appropriate and provided in accordance with applicable law and generally accepted health care practices and standards prevailing at the time the health care service is provided. \"Telehealth\" is defined in the Act as the delivery of health care services through the use of interactive audio and video, but does not include the delivery of health care services through an audio-only telephone, electronic mail message, or facsimile transmission. \"Health care services\" is defined as services for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, illness, injury, or disease, including dental care services and services for mental health conditions, illnesses, injuries, or diseases.

This Act creates new Iowa Code section 135N.1 and relates to agreements between individuals and health care professionals for the provision of certain primary care health services. A direct primary care agreement is an agreement between a provider and a patient in which the provider agrees to provide primary care health services to the patient for a service charge for the period of time designated in the agreement. The provider must be a health care professional licensed, accredited, registered, or certified to perform primary care health services consistent with state law. The service charge may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee, a subscription fee, or other charge paid by the patient to the provider. A direct primary care agreement must be in writing, must describe the scope of the primary care health services included under the agreement, must state each provider location where primary care health services may be obtained by a patient, must specify any out-of-office services that are included under the agreement, must specify the service charge and how often it must be paid, must specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the patient for primary care health services not covered by the service charge, and it must specify the duration of the direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed. A provider is prohibited from refusing to accept a new patient or discontinuing care for an existing patient based solely on the patient's health status. The Act provides that a direct primary care agreement is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the Commissioner of Insurance. A provider is not required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary care agreement. A provider is prohibited from billing an insurer for services provided under a direct primary care agreement. A patient may submit a request for reimbursement to an insurer if permitted under the patient's insurance policy. A provider may bill a patient's insurance for services provided by the provider that are not provided under the direct primary care agreement. A provider may accept payment of a service charge for a patient either directly or indirectly from a third party, including an employer on behalf of an employee.

The Act expands the definition to include trespassing violations. DETENTION OR SHELTER CARE HEARING . The Act provides a hearing for a child who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act is required to be held within two working days of the time of the child's admission to a shelter care facility and within one working day of a child's admission to a detention facility.

MAINTENANCE OR DESTRUCTION OF SEALED RECORDS . Iowa Code section 232.150 provides that on entry of a sealing order, all agencies and individuals having custody of juvenile records are required to send such records to the court issuing the order. The Act provides that maintenance or destruction of these records are to be prescribed by the State Court Administrator. SEALING OF CERTAIN DISTRICT COURT RECORDS . The Act amends Iowa Code section 803.1 concerning the state's criminal jurisdiction and juveniles. The Act requires the court, if it is determined that charges were erroneously filed in district court on an individual under the age of 18 and the juvenile court holds exclusive jurisdiction to dismiss the charge in district court and to direct the clerk of court to seal all records initiated in district court. The Act amends Iowa Code section 803.6 concerning the transfer of the jurisdiction of a defendant's case from district court to juvenile court. The Act requires the clerk of the district court to seal all records initiated in district court in cases involving the transfer of a defendant's case to juvenile court.

The Act amends the Dramshop Act to provide that damages resulting from an intoxicated person are available to a third party who is not the intoxicated person who caused the injury at issue, and that an alcoholic beverage licensee or permittee is liable only if the licensee or permittee sold and served any beer, wine, or intoxicating liquor directly to the intoxicated person, provided that the person was visibly intoxicated at the time of the sale or service. The Act limits the amount recoverable for noneconomic damages by each plaintiff to $250,000 unless certain circumstances are present. Previously, an alcoholic beverage licensee or permittee was liable to a person for all damages resulting from an intoxicated person if the licensee or permittee sold or served the alcohol to the intoxicated person when the licensee or permittee knew or should have known the person was intoxicated, or sold to and served the person to a point where the licensee or permittee knew or should have known the person would become intoxicated.

SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2175 2175 2175 - - - Partition Partition Partition of of of Property Property Property BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. This Act relates to partition of real and personal property in kind and by sale, repeals Iowa Code chapter 651 (Partition), creates new Iowa Code chapter 651, and incorporates the partition provisions that were previously set forth in the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure. The Act does not change the procedures related to an action for partition, partition pending probate or administration of an estate, a petition for partition and the parties to such, the answer to a partition petition, and the prohibition of a counterclaim or joinder of claims to a partition petition. The Act changes prior law regarding partition in the following areas: TERMS . The Act defines terms not previously defined partition \"ascendant,\" \"collateral,\" \"cotenant,\" \"descendant,\" \"heirs property,\" \"owelty,\" and \"relative.\" CIVIL CIVIL CIVIL LAW, LAW, LAW, PROCEDURE, PROCEDURE, PROCEDURE, AND AND AND COURT COURT COURT ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION 59 INITIAL DECREE. The court is required to file an initial decree establishing the shares and interests of all owners in a property that is subject to a partition petition. Prior law did not require the court to file an initial decree. REFEREES. Under prior law, the court appointed three referees for a partition in kind and one or more referees for a partition by sale. The court is now required to appoint one referee for any partition action unless the parties to the partition agree that the court should appoint more than one referee. The referee is required by the Act to file a report with the court that makes recommendations for completing the partition. APPRAISAL. For both partitions in kind and partitions by sale, the court must order an appraisal to be conducted by three disinterested persons with knowledge of property valuations or, if the owners of the property to be partitioned agree, by a different method. Prior law did not require the court to order an appraisal for a partition in kind; for a partition by sale, the appraisal had to be conducted by three disinterested freeholders. OWELTY. The Act authorizes owelty, an equitable remedy used in partition actions to equalize the lower value of property received by a party through the payment of moneys from a recipient of a higher value property, as part of a referee's recommendation for completing a partition. Under prior law, owelty was not specifically recognized as a remedy in a partition action. COSTS. The court shall order a reasonable fee, taxed as costs, for the plaintiff's attorney in a partition of real property. If the plaintiff is the losing party in any contest arising from any partition action, the plaintiff's attorney's fees related to such contest are not taxed as costs. Prior law required such fees to be taxed against the losing party. HEIRS PROPERTY. The Act details special procedures for partition in kind of heirs property. The Act defines \"heirs property\" as real property held in tenancy in common that, as of the date of the filing of a partition action, one or more of the cotenants acquired title to the property from a relative and the property does not have a recorded agreement associated with it that governs the partition of the property and that binds all of the cotenants. In addition, either 20 percent or more of the interests must be held by cotenants who are relatives, 20 percent or more of the interests must be held by an individual who acquired title from a relative, or 20 percent or more of the cotenants must be relatives as defined in the Act. The court is required to appoint a referee and to order an appraisal. After the referee files the appraisal, the court must conduct a hearing to determine the fair market value of the heirs property and send notice of the fair market value to all cotenants. If at that time a cotenant requests that the heirs property be partitioned by sale, all other cotenants have a specified time period in which to elect to purchase the interest of the cotenant requesting partition by sale. Furthermore, the Act provides for the determination of fractional ownership of each cotenant's interest in the heirs property before and after purchase of such interest, provides the time frame for a cotenant to pay for an interest a cotenant has elected to purchase from another cotenant, and provides for reallocation of all cotenants' interests in the heirs property based on the payments made, or not made, by the electing cotenants. If all payments are made by the electing cotenants, the court must order the heirs property to be partitioned in kind unless it determines that a partition in kind will result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group. In making such a determination, the court is required to consider the totality of eight factors as detailed in the Act.

HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2234 2234 2234 - - - Foreclosure Foreclosure Foreclosure Proceedings Proceedings Proceedings and and and Judgments Judgments Judgments on on on Claims Claims Claims for for for Rent Rent Rent BY COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE. This Act shortens the periods of time for redeeming real property from foreclosure and delaying sale of foreclosed property and increases the statute of limitations period for executing judgments on claims for rent. FORECLOSURE . Notwithstanding Iowa Code section 628.3, when a foreclosure of a mortgage on real property results from enforcement of a due-on-sale clause, the Act shortens the period that a mortgagor may redeem the real property from any time within 3 years to any time within 18 months from the day of sale under the levy. The Act also shortens the period during which the mortgagor's right of redemption is exclusive upon enforcement of a due-on-sale clause from the first 30 months from the day of sale under the levy to the first 15 months. Furthermore, the period during which creditors may redeem under Iowa Code sections 628.5, 628.15, and 628.16 is shortened from 33 months from the day of sale under the levy to 16 months. The Act shortens the periods of time associated with redemption of real property consisting of less than 10 acres from foreclosure. Under prior law, a mortgagor and mortgagee could agree to reduce the period of redemption from foreclosure as described in the mortgage instrument to a period of six months. The Act allows the mortgagor and mortgagee to agree to reduce the period of redemption by the debtor to three months if the property is not used for an agricultural purpose, provided certain criteria identified in Iowa Code section 628.26 are met. Under the Act, the debtor's right of redemption is exclusive during the first two months after sale or foreclosure. Under prior law, the debtor's right of redemption was exclusive for three months after sale or foreclosure. The Act reduces the time periods in Iowa Code sections 628.5, 628.15, and 628.16, from four months to three months if the mortgagor agrees to reduce the period of redemption after sale or foreclosure in return for the mortgagee waiving rights to a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. The Act also amends Iowa Code chapter 654. The Act changes the notice requirement and rule for foreclosure without redemption by changing the length of time a sale can be delayed when a defendant-mortgagor makes a written demand to a plaintiff-mortgagee to delay sale. The Act delays the sale by 6 months from entry of judgment as opposed to the prior 12 months. If a plaintiff-mortgagee's petition includes a waiver of deficiency judgment, a defendant-mortgagor's written demand will only result in a three-month, rather than a six-month, delay of sale following entry of judgment. EXECUTING JUDGMENTS ON CLAIMS FOR RENT . Prior law provided a five-year statute of limitation period to execute a judgment on a claim for rent, exclusive of any time during which a court stayed the judgment pending a bankruptcy action or order of the court, provided that if the judgment or right to collect is sold or assigned for value to third parties other than state or federally chartered banks or credit unions, the statute of limitation period is two years. At the end of the applicable statute of limitation period, all liens shall extinguish and the judgment is void. The Act extends the 5-year statute of limitation period to 10 years from the date of entry of judgment if the entry of judgment is in a court not of record. The Act extends the 5-year statute of limitation period to 20 years from the date of entry of judgment if the entry of judgment is in a court of record.

This Act relates to the mechanism by which a person with a legal disability (which is defined as a minor or person of unsound mind), or their legal representative, who owns a parcel of real estate that was sold at a tax sale may redeem such parcel. Under prior law, if a person with a legal disability is the owner of a parcel that is sold at a tax sale and the treasurer's deed has been delivered, the person with a legal disability may redeem the parcel at any time within one year after the disability is removed, in the manner specified in the Iowa Code. Iowa Code section 447.8 specifies the manner of redemption by an owner who alleges a failure by the holder of the tax title to serve the parcel owner with notice of the tax sale and the parcel owner's redemption rights. The Act amends the procedures by which a person with a legal disability can redeem a parcel sold at a tax sale after the delivery of the treasurer's deed. Before delivery of the treasurer's deed, the Act provides that the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative may redeem under Iowa Code sections 447.1 and 447.3. After delivery of the treasurer's deed, the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative must bring an equitable action for redemption in the district court of the county where the parcel is located and prove to the court that prior to the delivery of the treasurer's deed, the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative was entitled to redeem by virtue of such disability. All persons claiming an interest in the parcel from the tax sale must be named as defendants. If the court determines that the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative is entitled to redeem, the court shall determine the rights, claims, and interests of all of the parties and shall establish the amount necessary to effect redemption. The person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative has 30 days after the date of the order to pay the redemption amount. Upon timely receipt of payment, the court shall declare the treasurer's deed to be invalid. If the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative fails to timely pay the redemption amount, such person's redemption rights are terminated. An action to redeem a parcel sold at a tax sale may be brought until one year after the disability is removed unless otherwise barred. The Act bars bringing the action if the person with a legal disability remained in possession of the parcel, the person claiming under the tax title properly commenced an action to remove the person with a legal disability, and the person with a legal disability or the person's legal representative fails to timely file a counterclaim or separate action asserting the right of redemption. The Act also bars the action if the person with a legal disability is not in possession of the parcel and the action is barred by Iowa Code section 448.16. Iowa Code section 448.16 bars actions when the person claiming under tax title records an affidavit with the county recorder of the county where the parcel is located and a person with redemption rights fails to file a claim within 120 days after the filing of the affidavit. The Act bars the action if it is not filed within three years of the recording of the treasurer's deed.

The Act also specifies the conditions for determining whether medical support is to be provided through a health benefit plan other than public coverage or through public coverage and whether the custodial or noncustodial parent is required to provide health care coverage. The Act also: provides the process and order of priority to be followed when the Child Support Recovery Unit enters or seeks an order for medical support; directs the Department of Human Services to adopt administrative rules to administer the Act; and provides for transitional administration until such time as the administrative rules are adopted.

A person commits an aggravated misdemeanor for failing to report to an official or officer at a community-based correctional facility a known violation or attempted violation involving contraband. The Act, in part, is a response to the Iowa Supreme Court's decision in State v. Halverson , 857 N.W.2d 632 (Iowa 2015), which held that a person illegally possessing a controlled substance at a community-based correctional facility does not commit the criminal offense of possessing contraband because a community-based correctional facility is not an institution under the control of the Department of Corrections.

The IWDB is directed to create and update a list of high-demand jobs statewide for purposes of programs established by the Act, and for purposes of postsecondary summer classes for high school students. In addition to the list created by the IWDB, each community college, in consultation with regional career and technical education planning partnerships, and with the approval of the board of directors of the community college, may identify and maintain a list of not more than five regional high-demand jobs in the community college region, and shall share its list with the IWDB. A community college's list may be used in its region for certain programs established under the Act. The IWDB has full discretion to select and prioritize statewide high-demand jobs, but must consult with business and 76 ECONOMIC ECONOMIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT education stakeholders and seek public comment. \"High-demand job\" is defined to mean a job in the state for which the IWDB, or a community college for its region, determines work opportunities are available and qualified applicants are lacking. The IWDB must also compile and submit an annual report relating to participation in the programs to the Governor and the General Assembly. SUMMER YOUTH INTERN PROGRAM. A summer youth intern program is established within the Department of Workforce Development (IWD) to promote learning by providing internship opportunities that allow youths who are at risk of not graduating from high school, are from low-income households, are from communities underrepresented in the Iowa workforce, or otherwise face barriers to success and upward mobility in the labor market, to explore and prepare for high-demand careers, to gain work experience, and to develop personal attributes necessary to succeed in the workplace.

This Act relates to school district finance by modifying provisions relating to the calculation of the regular program state cost per pupil and the regular program district cost per pupil and establishing a transportation equity program and fund. Division I of the Act relates to the determination of the regular program state cost per pupil and the determination of regular program district cost per pupil for school districts. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the regular program state cost per pupil is the regular program state cost per pupil for the base year plus the regular program supplemental state aid for the budget year, plus $5. Then with the budget year beginning July 1, 2019, and succeeding budget years, the regular program state cost per pupil will again be calculated as provided under current law without any additional amount added. If the regular program district cost per pupil for the budget year calculated in any school district is less than the regular program state cost per pupil for the budget year, the Department of Management shall increase the regular program district cost per pupil of that district to an amount equal to the regular program state cost per pupil for the budget year. Division I of the Act took effect March 8, 2018. Division II of the Act establishes a transportation equity program to provide additional funding for school districts with a transportation cost per pupil that exceeds the statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil, as determined by the Department of Management. The amount of transportation equity aid for each school district is an amount equal to the school district's actual enrollment for the school year, excluding the shared-time enrollment for the school year, multiplied by the school district's transportation cost per pupil differential, as defined by the Act, for the budget year. The Act establishes a transportation equity fund and appropriates all moneys in the fund to the Department of Management for purposes of making the transportation equity aid payments. However, if the balance of the fund exceeds the amount necessary to make all transportation equity aid payments, moneys remaining in the fund are required to be used for transportation base funding payments. Transportation base funding payments for each school district in the state are calculated by multiplying the school district's enrollment used to calculate transportation equity aid by the lesser of the statewide average transportation cost per pupil or the school district's transportation cost per pupil for the budget year. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, the Act appropriates $11.2 million to the fund from the General Fund of the State. The Act prohibits the sum of the transportation equity aid payment and the transportation base funding payment paid to a school district for a budget year from exceeding the school district's actual transportation cost for the budget year. The Act specifies that transportation equity aid payments and transportation base funding payments received by a school district are considered miscellaneous income, must be deposited in the general fund of the school district, are not included in the calculation of district cost, and do not affect a school district's eligibility for transportation assistance granted by the school budget review committee.

This Act modifies Code provisions relating to the delivery of educational instruction and course content primarily over the Internet; allows a conditional exemption to the courses school districts and accredited nonpublic schools must offer and teach under the state's educational program; modifies or eliminates concurrent online enrollment limitations; allows a pupil who is participating in open enrollment for 84 EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION purposes of online instruction to participate in cocurricular or extracurricular activities in the district of residence; directs the departments of Public Health and Education to convene a student health working group to review state-initiated student health requirements; directs the Director of the Department of Education to develop and administer a seal of biliteracy program; limits the authority of the department, the director, and the State Board of Education to issue guidance; and adds one-half unit in personal finance literacy to the courses school districts and accredited nonpublic schools must offer and teach at the high school level. Division I \u2014 Online Education The Act eliminates provisions requiring the state board to adopt rules prohibiting or limiting the open enrollment of students whose educational instruction and course content are delivered primarily over the Internet. Instead, under the Act, the state board must adopt rules requiring that online instruction be aligned with the Iowa core standards as applicable. Under such rules, a school district may develop and offer to students enrolled in the district online instruction. The director of the department shall maintain a list of approved online providers that meet the state core curriculum and content standards and national online course standards, and that provide course content through an online learning platform taught by an Iowa licensed teacher that has specialized training or experience in online learning. Senate File 2415 (see Appropriations) amends this Act to specify that the Iowa licensed teacher must be licensed under Iowa Code chapter 272. The requirement that the department survey a percentage of online students is eliminated. The state's educational program \"offer and teach\" course requirements at the high school level shall not apply for up to two specified subjects at a school district or accredited nonpublic school if the district or school, as applicable, makes every reasonable effort to employ a licensed teacher for the class but is unable to staff the class, or if fewer than 10 students typically register for instruction in the specified course. The department may continue to waive such course requirements for additional specified subjects for up to one year. Such courses, though, must be provided by the department's Iowa Learning Online Initiative unless the initiative lacks the capacity to accommodate additional pupils, in which case the course may be offered by the school district or school through an online platform. However, SF 2415 (see Appropriations) amends this provision to provide that if the initiative lacks the capacity, the course may be offered by a school district or school itself if certain conditions are met, or through a private provider that meets standards specified under Iowa Code section 256.42 and is approved by the director of the department. The Act allows school districts to provide online courses developed by private providers to pupils participating in open enrollment. However, if the pupil terminates enrollment in the online coursework, the receiving district must notify the district of residence of the termination within 30 days. Senate File 2415 amends this provision to add that private providers must meet the standards of Iowa Code section 256.42 and be approved by the director. A school district, school, or private provider is prohibited from offering a rebate or bonus to a pupil's parent or guardian for the pupil's enrollment in online coursework. Division II \u2014 Concurrent Enrollment \u2014 Career and Technical Exception to Limitation The Act allows a school district and community college to enter into a sharing agreement to offer, or provide a community college-employed instructor to teach, one or more classes in only one of the six career and technical education service areas required under the state's educational program at the high school level. Pupils enrolled in such a class shall be assigned additional weighting if the course enrollment exceeds five and the school district's total enrollment does not exceed 600 pupils. Division III \u2014 Student Health Working Group The departments of Public Health and Education are directed to convene a student health working group to review state-initiated student health requirements, including but not limited to statutory requirements relating to dental and vision health screenings, blood lead testing, immunizations, and other related requirements imposed on public EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION 85 schools. The working group must develop a uniform enforcement framework that includes a single method for enforcement of the current student health requirements and related data collection. Voting members of the working group shall include persons deemed appropriate by the Department of Public Health as well as one representative of each of the following, appointed by the respective entity: the Department of Education, the Department of Public Health, the area education agencies, and the Iowa Academy of Family Physicians. The working group shall submit the framework and its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly not later than December 31, 2018. Division IV \u2014 Open Enrollment \u2014 Extracurricular Activity Fee The Act allows a pupil who is participating in open enrollment for purposes of online instruction to participate in up to two cocurricular and extracurricular activities in the district of residence under the same conditions and requirements as pupils enrolled in the district of residence. However, the district of residence may approve the student's participation in additional activities. If an open-enrolled pupil participates in cocurricular or extracurricular activities in the district of residence, the district of residence may deduct up to $200 per activity, for up to two activities, from the amount that the district of residence is otherwise required to pay to the receiving district under Iowa Code section 282.18. The district of residence may charge a pupil a fee for participation in such cocurricular or extracurricular activities equivalent to the fee charged to and paid in the same manner by other resident pupils. Division V \u2014 Department of Education \u2014 Biliteracy Seal The Act directs the department's director to develop and administer a seal of biliteracy program to recognize students graduating from high school who have demonstrated proficiency in two or more world languages, one of which may be American Sign Language and one of which must be English. Participation in the program by a school district, attendance center, or accredited nonpublic school is voluntary. The department must work with stakeholders to identify standardized tests that may be utilized to demonstrate proficiency. The seal of biliteracy may be a sticker to be affixed to a student's high school transcript, a certificate, or other authorized endorsement. The department is required to provide seals to a participating school district or school and may charge a nominal fee to cover costs. Division VI \u2014 Limitation on Department of Education Guidance The Act defines guidance as any document or statement issued by the department, the state board, or the director that purports to interpret a law, rule, or other legal authority and is designed to provide advice or direction regarding the implementation of or compliance with a law, rule, or other legal authority. The department, the state board, and the director are prohibited from issuing guidance that imposes a legal obligation or duty on a person unless the obligation or duty is required or reasonably implied by law, rule, or other legal authority. Guidance issued in violation of the prohibition is not legally binding. The division took effect April 17, 2018. House File 2441 contains the same provisions relating to department guidance. Division VII \u2014 Financial Literacy The Act adds a one-half unit course in personal finance literacy to the educational program each school district and accredited nonpublic school is required to offer in grades 9-12, and requires all students to take the course as a condition of graduation. The curriculum must at a minimum address areas relating to savings, understanding investments, wealth building and college planning, credit and debt, consumer awareness of the power of marketing on buying decisions, financial responsibility and money management, insurance and risk management, income and career decisions, different types of insurance coverage, and real estate and mortgages. The division takes effect July 1, 2019. Senate File 2415 amends this division to provide that a half unit of personal finance literacy may count as a half unit of social studies for meeting the educational program requirements for high school social studies coursework, though the personal finance literacy teacher need not hold a social studies endorsement; and to provide that units of coursework that meet the requirements of any combination of specified coursework required under the high school education standards and incorporate the personal finance literacy curriculum shall be deemed to satisfy 86 EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION the educational program requirements relating to personal finance literacy and that a student who completes such a unit shall be deemed to have met the graduation requirement.

This Act directs the State Board of Education to adopt administrative rules to require school districts to adopt protocols for suicide prevention and postvention and the identification of adverse childhood experiences, as defined in the Act, and strategies to mitigate toxic stress response. School boards shall require annual training of at least one hour by July 1, 2019, on the same subjects for all school personnel who hold a license or other credential issued by the Board of Educational Examiners and who have regular contact with students in kindergarten through grade 12.

This Act transfers statutory provisions relating to practitioner preparation programs from Iowa Code sections 272.25 and 272.27 to Iowa Code section 256.16, eliminates obsolete language relating to the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, strikes an unnecessary modifier used when referring to a public school district, and repeals the Before and After School Grant Program. CORE ACADEMIC INDICATORS IN SCIENCE. To correspond with a change in the assessment requirements enacted in 2017, the Act requires that the State Board of Education's rules provide a set of core academic indicators in science in grade 10, rather than the current requirement for core academic indicators in science in grade 11. OBSOLETE NCLB-RELATED PROVISIONS. The Act strikes language providing for a requirement that school districts and accredited nonpublic schools annually report to the department and to the local community the district-wide progress made in attaining student achievement goals, demonstrate the use of multiple assessment measures in determining student achievement, and submit to the department related student data. The requirement included the use of uniform definitions consistent with the NCLB Act. The Act makes corresponding changes. PRACTITIONER PREPARATION PROGRAMS \u2014 STATE BOARD RULES. Currently, statutory provisions relating to the state board's responsibility to adopt rules relating to institutions that offer practitioner preparation programs and professional development programs are located in Iowa Code chapters 256 (Department of Education) and 272 (Educational Examiners Board). The Act transfers such statutory language from Iowa Code chapter 272 to Iowa Code section 256.16 (Specific Criteria for Teacher Preparation and Certain Educators), and removes resulting redundancies by repealing Iowa Code sections 272.25 and 272.27. BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM \u2014 REPEALED. The Act repeals the Before and After School Grant Program, which was established to provide competitive grants to school districts and other public and private organizations to expand the availability of before and after school programs and summer schools. The program has not received state funding since FY 2008-2009.

This Act relates to school district funding and the authorized purposes for the expenditure of school district funding for various education programs. The Act includes various effective date and applicability date provisions. EARLY INTERVENTION CATEGORICAL FUNDING. For school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the Act changes the permissible use of the early intervention categorical funding supplement for school districts from uses that comply with the requirements of Iowa Code chapter 256D (Iowa Early Intervention Block Grant Program) to any school general fund purpose. This provision took effect April 11, 2018. AT-RISK AND DROPOUT PREVENTION. Under prior law, school districts were required to submit to the Department of Education for approval program plans and requests for a modified supplemental amount for programs for at-risk students, secondary students who attend alternative programs and alternative schools, and returning dropouts and dropout prevention. The Act strikes the requirement for submission to and approval by the department and instead allows such program plans to be approved by resolution of the school district board of directors and makes corresponding changes related to the strike of that requirement. When the board of directors of a school district requests to use a modified supplemental amount for the excess cost of an adopted program, the Act requires such a request to be submitted to the School Budget Review Committee instead of the department. For a school district requesting to use a modified supplemental amount, the Act strikes the 5 percent limitation on the percentage of a district's budget enrollment that may be identified as returning dropouts or potential dropouts and modifies deadlines for filing requests for a modified supplemental amount. The Act adds the salary and benefits for staff, including but not limited to administrative staff and guidance counselors and salary and benefits or contract payments for licensed psychologists, licensed independent social workers or master social workers and licensed mental health counselors, to the list of permissible uses of funding under an adopted program. The professional development costs for those additional staff and counselors and school security personnel costs are also added to the list of permissible funding uses. In addition, the Act authorizes the expenditure of such funding for any purpose determined by the board of directors that directly benefits students participating in the adopted program. Provisions relating to at-risk and dropout prevention apply to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2019. SCHOOL DISTRICT LEASES. The Act amends a provision relating to the authority of a school board to lease a portion of an existing school building by striking a five-year lease duration limitation and providing that certain provisions relating to the payment of property taxes because of leases do not apply to property or equipment leased as part of a project designed to generate electricity for the school district. The provision took effect April 11, 2018, and applies to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018. 90 EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION SCHOOL DISTRICT FUND TRANSFERS. Under current law, a school district board of directors is permitted to transfer funds from the school district's general fund to the student activity fund in an amount necessary to purchase protective and safety equipment required for any extracurricular interscholastic athletic contest or competition. The Act adds the reconditioning of such protective and safety equipment to the list of purposes for which such a transfer is permitted. The provision took effect April 11, 2018, and applies to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018. CHILD CARE FUND. The Act provides that if the sum of the fees collected for participation in a before and after school program and other moneys deposited in the fund as the result of the before and after school program exceeds the amount necessary to operate the before and after school program, the excess amount may, following a public hearing, be transferred to the general fund of the school corporation to be used for school district general fund purposes. The provision took effect April 11, 2018, and applies to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018. HOME SCHOOL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. The Act provides that the existing law provisions governing the purposes for and limitations on the expenditure of funds under a school district's home school assistance program shall not be construed to prohibit a school from authorizing the use of items and materials purchased for the program for school district purposes other than the home school assistance program so long as the authorized use does not prevent or interfere with the item or material's use by parents or students utilizing the program. This provision takes effect April 11, 2018, and applies to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018. LIMITATION ON GUIDANCE. The Act prohibits the department, the State Board of Education, and the director of the department from issuing guidance that imposes a legal obligation or duty on a person unless the obligation or duty is required or reasonably implied by law, rule, or other legal authority. Division II of HF 2502 (see Appropriations) amends this Act to eliminate the provision that makes the guidance provisions applicable to school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.

The Act requires a student and the student's parent or guardian to sign and return the sheet to the student's school prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity, as defined in the Act. The Act requires that a student be immediately removed from participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care provider or an emergency medical care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury in the student. The student is prohibited from recommencing participation or participating in any dance or cheerleading activity or activity, contest, or practice governed by IHSAA or the IGHSAU until the student has been evaluated by a licensed health care EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION 91 provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions and other brain injuries and has received written clearance to return to or commence participation from a licensed health care provider. The Act requires DPH, in cooperation with IHSAA and IGHSAU, to develop and adopt by rule a return-to-play protocol based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a student's return to participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. School boards and the authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7-12 shall adopt the protocol by July 1, 2019.

HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2467 2467 2467 - - - School School School Meal Meal Meal Debt Debt Debt and and and School School School Meal Meal Meal Programs Programs Programs BY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. This Act relates to school meal programs offered by school districts and accredited nonpublic schools, by allowing school districts to seek to use the setoff procedures administered by the Department of Administrative Services, and allowing a school district to deposit moneys from its flexibility account into an unpaid student meals account to be used only to pay student meal debt accrued by individuals. At least twice a year, the school must notify all parents or guardians about the availability of applications for federal assistance for free or reduced-fee meals. If a student owes moneys for five or more meals, school personnel may notify the parent or guardian of the availability of federal assistance applications or provide information on other options or assistance available. Such communications shall be directed to the parent or guardian, but information about the student's meal account may be discreetly provided to the student if the communication does not otherwise violate provisions of the Act. A school is encouraged to provide a reimbursable meal, as specified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to a student who requests one unless the student's parent or guardian has specifically provided written permission to the school to withhold a meal from the student. A school is prohibited from posting a list of students who owe money for school meals; from publicly identifying or stigmatizing a student who cannot pay for a meal or who owes a meal debt; from requiring the student to consume the meal at a table set aside for such purpose, to discard a meal after the meal has been served, or to do chores or other work to pay for meals; and from denying the student participation in an afterschool program or other extracurricular activity. The school district must set fair and equitable procedures for the use of moneys in the unpaid student meals account. The setoff procedures can be sought by a school district if the school district has made reasonable efforts to collect the school meal debt.

This Act relates to programs and activities administered by the Secretary of State and affecting county commissioners of voter registration and elections, by altering the laws governing the Safe at Home Program, elections, voter registration, and civil office vacancies. The Safe at Home Program, which prevents the addresses of victims of certain crimes from appearing on public records, is amended to prohibit a registered sex offender from enrolling in the program. With respect to elections, the Act moves the permissible December special election date for school districts or merged areas in even-numbered years from the first to the second Tuesday of the month. The Act changes the deadline for filing an objection to the legal sufficiency of a certificate of nomination or nomination petition or the eligibility of a candidate from 74 days to 68 days before an election. The definition of \"document\" for the purposes of proving residency for voter registration is altered to explicitly include electronic documents. A county commissioner of registration may cancel a voter's registration after the voter's death upon receiving a written statement from a family member, an obituary posted on the Internet site of a licensed funeral home, or a written statement from the personal representative of the decedent's estate. The Act allows one member of the Board of Examiners for Voting Systems to have been trained in cybersecurity rather than computer programming and operations. A person applying for an absentee ballot at the office of the county commissioner must include that person's voter verification number in the application for a ballot. The Act permits a person to attest to the identity of two persons unable to present a form of identification when attempting to vote. The Act also provides that a county commissioner of elections may perform a hand count of less than all ballots cast and must notify the county chairperson of each political party at least two days before a hand count is to take place. If an invited representative of a political party does not appear at a hand count, the county commissioner must inform the State Commissioner of Elections.

This Act modifies various provisions relating to public utilities. The Act adds gasworks and facilities useful for the delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies. The Act prohibits public agencies participating in joint financing agreements from exercising their powers of eminent domain to acquire interests in properties used for the transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas. The Act removes the requirement for certain electric utilities having fewer than 10,000 customers and electric cooperative corporations and associations to file energy efficiency plans and results with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB). The Act also removes the applicability of provisions relating to alternate energy production facilities to such utilities. Prior law allowed the board of directors or the membership of non-rate-regulated electric cooperatives to elect to have the cooperative's rates regulated by the IUB, and subsequently allowed the membership of the cooperative to elect to exempt the cooperative from rate regulation. The Act allows the board of directors to also subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate regulation, but provides that if the membership elected to have the cooperative's rates regulated by the IUB, only the membership may elect to exempt the cooperative from rate regulation. The Act removes the IUB's regulatory authority over municipally owned utilities for regulatory action pertaining to discrimination against users of renewable energy resources. The Act also removes the requirement for municipally owned utilities to file energy efficiency plans and results with the IUB. Prior law allowed public utilities to automatically adjust rates and charges provided that a schedule showing the automatic adjustment is first filed with the IUB. The Act requires such schedule to be filed with and approved by the IUB. The Act also allows a public utility to automatically adjust rates and charges to recover certain costs related to transmission, provided that a schedule showing the automatic adjustment is first filed with and approved by the IUB. The Act requires the IUB to adopt rules regarding the reporting of transmission expenses and transmission-related activity. Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer energy efficiency programs to customers through energy efficiency plans, which plans must be cost-effective. The Act adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests the IUB must apply to determine the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. The Act requires rate-regulated electric utilities to file five-year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans with the IUB and requires rate-regulated gas utilities to file five-year energy efficiency plans with the IUB. The Act specifies that an energy efficiency plan and budget or a demand response plan or budget must include a range of energy efficiency or demand response programs. The Act allows customers of rate-regulated electric utilities to request exemptions from participation in any five-year energy efficiency plan offered by an electric utility if the energy efficiency plan and demand response plan, at the time of approval by the IUB, have a cumulative rate-payer impact test result of less than one. Upon receiving a request for exemption by a customer, an electric utility shall grant the exemption and, beginning January 1 of the following year, the customer shall no longer be assessed the costs of the plan and shall be prohibited from participating in any program included in the plan until the exemption no longer applies, as determined by the IUB. The Act requires the IUB to adopt rules establishing reasonable procedures for electric utility customers from any customer class to request exemptions from such energy efficiency plans. The Act allows rate-regulated gas and electric utilities to request an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan modification during the course of a five-year plan for any reason identified by the utility. The IUB shall take action 100 ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY AND AND AND PUBLIC PUBLIC PUBLIC UTILITIES UTILITIES UTILITIES on a modification request within 90 days after the request is filed, or else the modification request shall be deemed approved. The Act provides that the IUB shall not require a gas utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan effective on or after January 1, 2019, that results in projected cumulative average annual costs that exceed 1.5 percent of the gas utility's expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue from retail customers in the state. The IUB shall not require an electric utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan effective on or after January 1, 2019, that results in projected cumulative average annual costs that exceed 2 percent of the electric utility's expected annual Iowa retail rate revenue from retail customers in the state. The Act requires the IUB to approve, reject, or modify an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan filed pursuant to the Act no later than March 31, 2019, or else any plan filed by the utility and approved by the IUB prior to May 4, 2018, shall be terminated. The Act prohibits the IUB from requiring a gas or electric utility to implement an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan that does not meet the requirements of the Act. Prior law prohibited a gas or electric utility from representing energy efficiency in customer billings as a separate cost or expense unless the IUB otherwise approves. The Act provides that beginning January 1, 2019, a gas or electric utility shall represent energy efficiency and demand response in customer billings as a separate cost or expense. The Act removes a provision that allowed the IUB to require rate-regulated gas or electric utilities to offer financing to customers for certain energy efficiency improvements. The Act allows the IUB to adopt rules to provide for a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas extensions. The Act requires customers of rate-regulated gas and electric utilities to receive the full benefits of the utilities' reduced federal corporate income taxes as provided in the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Act requires the IUB to approve any proposal filed by a utility to pass such benefits on to customers no later than June 1, 2018. The IUB may approve rates with provision for adjustments to ensure that the rates are accurate and that customers receive the full benefits. The Act provides that electric utilities that are not required to be rate-regulated shall not be subject to the IUB's rules in regard to deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the IUB's rules in regard to payment plans made prior to the disconnection of services. Prior law prohibited municipalities, corporations, or cooperative associations providing electrical or gas service from considering the use of renewable energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing discriminatory rates or charges. The Act removes municipalities providing electrical or gas service from such prohibition. Prior law required the IUB to adopt rules that required the IUB to consider the most current test period to determine rates in rate regulator proceedings. The Act requires the IUB to adopt rules to require the IUB to use either a historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. Current law requires the IUB to specify in advance the ratemaking principles that shall apply whenever a rate-regulated public utility files an application to significantly alter an existing electric generating facility. The Act adds the repowering of an alternate energy production facility to the list of significant alterations that require the IUB to specify ratemaking principles in advance. The Act requires the Economic Development Authority, in collaboration with the Department of Transportation and the Iowa utility industry, to conduct a study of electric vehicle infrastructure support and make recommendations in a report submitted to the General Assembly no later than June 30, 2019. Such study shall evaluate the relative costs and benefits associated with various options for electric vehicle infrastructure support for both commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The following provisions of the Act took effect May 4, 2018: the provision of the Act that places caps on energy efficiency plans and demand response plans adopted by gas or electric utilities; the provision of the Act that requires ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY AND AND AND PUBLIC PUBLIC PUBLIC UTILITIES UTILITIES UTILITIES 101 the IUB to approve, reject, or modify an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan filed pursuant to the Act no later than March 31, 2019; and the provision of the Act that requires the IUB to approve any proposal filed by a rate-regulated gas or electric utility to pass the full benefits of the utility's reduced federal taxes on to customers no later than June 1, 2018.

This Act relates to the sale or acquisition of certain utilities. SALE OF CITY UTILITIES. The Act establishes a procedure for the governing body of a city to dispose of a city utility by sale. The Act provides that the governing body of a city shall not submit a proposal to the voters of the city to discontinue a city utility by sale unless the governing body determines the fair market value of the utility system, prepares an inventory of the city utility's real and personal property, prepares a financial information statement, considers alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale, makes certain information available on the governing body's Internet site, and makes a good-faith effort to provide certain information by regular mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of the city utility. The Act provides that if a proposal to discontinue a city utility by sale is to be submitted to the voters of the city, the city council shall submit the proposal at the next general, regular, or special election, within 120 days after the governing body meets the requirements of the Act. Any such proposal approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility. No action that questions the legality of an election or the city and governing body's compliance with the Act, unless specified, may be brought within 20 days of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors. ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN UTILITIES. The Act establishes a procedure for the acquisition of certain water, sanitary sewer, and storm water utilities by rate-regulated public utilities. The Act provides that a public utility shall not acquire, in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from certain non-rate-regulated entities, unless the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be acquired is a city utility, the city must first meet the requirements specified in the Act for the disposal of a city utility by sale. The Act allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the IUB prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers of the acquired utility. The Act requires the IUB to specify by order the ratemaking principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired utility are included in regulated rates as part of its review of a proposed acquisition. In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the IUB shall use the lesser of the sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility, as specified in the Act, shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified rates for a period of time. The IUB shall find that the proposed acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all customers. In making this finding, the IUB may consider any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates. In determining whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition, the IUB shall consider whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable rates to all customers. The Act provides that upon the IUB's approval of a proposed acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the acquisition shall have the option to proceed with the acquisition, subject to any applicable termination provisions. The Act provides that notwithstanding any provisions in Iowa Code chapter 476 (Public Utility Regulation) to the contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the IUB shall be binding with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate proceeding. 102 ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY AND AND AND PUBLIC PUBLIC PUBLIC UTILITIES UTILITIES UTILITIES HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2446 2446 2446 - - - Regulation Regulation Regulation of of of Public Public Public Utilities Utilities Utilities BY COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE. This Act modifies various provisions relating to the Utilities Division of the Department of Commerce. Prior law required the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to appoint an executive secretary. The Act requires the IUB to appoint a chief operating officer instead of an executive secretary and specifies that the role of the chief operating officer is to manage the operations of the Utilities Division, as directed by the IUB. The Act replaces references to \"executive secretary\" with \"chief operating officer\" throughout the Iowa Code. Prior law disqualified a person owning any bonds, stock, or property in a railroad company from holding office in the IUB. The Act removes this disqualification. Prior law exempted certain mutual telephone companies from rate regulation under Iowa Code chapter 476 (Public Utility Regulation). Prior law also allowed certain telephone companies otherwise exempt from rate regulation to elect to have their rates regulated by IUB. The Act removes both of these provisions. The Act removes language in Iowa Code section 476.1D(4), relating to the deregulation of telephone utilities, which allowed the IUB to consider certain expenses associated with the sale of classified directory advertising by a telephone utility in determining rates for the utility. The Act also strikes Iowa Code section 476.1D(1), which allowed the IUB to classify long distance telephone companies as competitive long distance telephone companies. The Act removes an outdated requirement for the IUB to provide a report to the General Assembly regarding certain energy efficiency planning efforts. The Act strikes Iowa Code section 476.6(21), which provided cost recovery for certain rate-regulated public utilities in undertaking analyses and preparations for the possible construction of nuclear generating facilities. The Act allows the IUB to allocate and directly charge expenses attributable to the IUB's duties to a person subject to IUB inspection. Current law requires the board to specify certain ratemaking principles that will apply to certain electric generating facilities by finding that the public utility has demonstrated to the board that its facility or lease is reasonable. The Act removes the requirement that the utility demonstrate the reasonableness of its facility or lease through a competitive bidding process. The Act strikes and replaces Iowa Code section 476.95, providing that notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a department, agency, board, or other political subdivision of the state shall not regulate the entry, rates, terms, or conditions for Internet protocol-enabled service or voice over Internet protocol service, as defined in the Act. The Act does not affect, modify, limit, or expand any of the following: the authority of the Attorney General to take specified action; the application or enforcement of any law that is intended to have general application to the conduct of business in the state; any entity's obligations under specified federal law; any authority of the IUB over wholesale telecommunications services, rates, agreements, interconnection, providers, or tariffs; any authority of the IUB to address the resolution of a dispute regarding intercarrier compensation; any authority of the IUB to assess voice over Internet protocol service for specified surcharges, assessments, or costs; or any authority of the IUB to regulate Internet protocol-enabled service or voice over Internet protocol service pursuant to Iowa Code section 476.91. The Act requires telecommunications service providers offering telephone numbers to retail customers in the state to register annually with the IUB by completing an application for registration on a form provided by the IUB. The IUB shall issue a nonexclusive acknowledgment of compliance within five business days of the receipt of a completed application. The acknowledgment shall authorize the registrant to obtain telephone numbers, interconnect with other providers, cross railroad rights-of-way, and provide telecommunications service in the state. A registrant shall submit any corrections to the registration form within a reasonable time after a change in circumstances. Refusal to file and maintain an annual registration is a violation of Iowa Code chapter 476 and may subject a telecommunications service provider to a civil penalty under Iowa Code section 476.51. Notwithstanding the Act, the IUB shall continue ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY AND AND AND PUBLIC PUBLIC PUBLIC UTILITIES UTILITIES UTILITIES 103 to recognize the validity of certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to telecommunications service providers prior to July 1, 2018. The Act exempts registered telecommunications service providers from various requirements throughout Iowa Code chapter 476. The Act provides that the IUB may exercise any powers reserved or delegated to the state by federal law, and may hear and resolve any dispute, relating to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and number portability. Prior law required the IUB to impose an annual assessment upon all telecommunications carriers in the state to fund dual party relay service programs with the assessment rate depending on the type of telecommunications carrier. The Act replaces \"telecommunications carriers\" with \"wireless carriers and wire-line local exchange carriers,\" and applies the same assessment rate to such entities at $0.03 per month for each telecommunications service phone number provided in the state. The Act also provides that wire-line local exchange carriers shall not recover from intrastate access charges any portion of such assessments. Prior law required pipeline companies doing business in the state to pay the IUB an annual inspection fee of $0.50 per mile of pipeline located in the state. The Act removes this set fee and instead allows the IUB to charge pipeline companies with annual inspection fees that are directly attributable to the costs of conducting inspections. Current law allows a landowner to petition a county to appoint a compensation commission to determine damages arising from the construction of certain pipelines if the landowner and pipeline company are unable to agree on damages. The Act removes the requirement that a landowner pay the costs incurred by the pipeline company if the commission's assessment of damages does not exceed 110 percent of the pipeline company's final offer prior to the assessment. The Act repeals the following Iowa Code sections: 476.11 (telephone toll connections); 476.57 (limitations on use of automatic dialing-announcing device equipment); 476.96 (definitions relating to local exchange competition); and 476.101 (local exchange competition). The Act removes references to such provisions throughout the Iowa Code.

This Act relates to water quality by modifying an existing wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality programs, providing for transfers and appropriations related to water quality, creating a water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption, and providing for other changes related to water quality. The provisions are administered by a number of entities, including the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (DALS) including its Division of Soil Conservation and Water Quality, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Iowa State University of Science and Technology (ISU), the Iowa Finance Authority (IFA), and the Department of Revenue (DOR). WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS. The Act establishes two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs as part of the existing water quality initiative of DALS. These programs consist of an edge-of-field infrastructure program and an in-field infrastructure program. Both programs provide financing on a cost-share basis to certain agriculture infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects. The edge-of-field program supports projects that capture or filter nutrients entering into surface water, including wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and land use changes. The in-field infrastructure program supports projects that decrease erosion and precipitation-induced surface runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil sustainability, including structures, terraces, waterways located on cropland or pastureland, soil conservation or erosion control structures, or managed drainage systems. The programs are required to be administered in a manner that is consistent with the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, prepared and updated by DALS, DNR, and ISU. Program projects must be located on agricultural land and are limited to infrastructure designed and installed for use over multiple years. The Act requires DALS and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects, provides that DALS may support multiple installations of infrastructure on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs may be combined by DALS if it is cost effective. DALS is required to submit annual reports detailing program expenditures and is allowed to use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for administrative purposes. The Act amends the Wastewater Treatment Financial Assistance Program administered by IFA. The Act adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems, including source water protection projects. The Act also removes a requirement that an applicant qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged communities receive priority. The Act also modifies other priority designations and provides that a utility management organization formed under Iowa Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Iowa Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial assistance. The Act adds reporting and review requirements, modifies the permitted use of program moneys for administrative purposes, and creates a water quality financing review committee consisting of three members representing DALS, IFA, and DNR to review and approve applications for financial assistance. Finally, the Act requires IFA to submit annual reports detailing expenditures under the program and creates a program review committee that, beginning September 1, 2027, revises the effectiveness of the program every 10 years. The Act creates a water quality financing program to provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance for projects designed to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint sources. The program is administered by IFA in cooperation with DNR and DALS. Entities eligible to participate in the program include municipalities, landowners, public utilities, and rural water districts or rural water associations. The program includes certain application requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements with IFA. To be eligible for financial assistance under the water quality financing program, a proposed project must improve water quality in the local area or watershed using practices identified in the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy. Drainage and levee districts organized under Iowa Code chapter 468 are required to utilize installations described in the edge-of-field infrastructure program. IFA is required to review proposed projects, negotiate project details, and approve or deny applications. IFA is also required to submit annual reports detailing expenditures under the program to the Governor and General Assembly. The Act creates a water quality urban infrastructure program as part of the existing water quality initiative of DALS to support watershed projects and advance implementation of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy. The 108 ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROTECTION PROTECTION program may support demonstration projects that decrease erosion, precipitation-induced surface runoff, and storm water discharges and that increase water infiltration rates. The projects must be based on Iowa's Storm Water Management Manual published by the DNR. Financial assistance is provided on a cost-share basis or through cooperative agreements with certain watersheds. DALS and landowners are required to enter into agreements for financing projects under the program, and the program allows DALS to support multiple installations of infrastructure on a single parcel of land. DALS is allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys for administrative purposes, may use any amount available under the program to develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water quality within the state's watersheds, and may use any amount available under the program to extend and support the three-year data collection of the in-field agricultural practices project administered by ISU as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, chapter 132, \u00a718. DALS is required to submit annual reports detailing program expenditures to the Governor and General Assembly. WATER QUALITY PROGRAM FUNDING. The Act creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users, and exempts the same service from the state sales and use tax. The water service excise tax is repealed on the earlier of July 1, 2029, or the date on which the state sales tax rate is increased above 6 percent. Water service tax revenues are deposited in the General Fund of the State, and then a specified portion of the revenues are transferred to various other funds each year to support the water quality programs created in the Act. For water services tax revenues collected on or after July 1, 2018, but before August 1, 2019, one-twelfth of the revenues are transferred to a Water Quality Financial Assistance Fund, which then appropriates the tax revenues as follows: 40 percent to IFA for the Wastewater and Drinking Water Treatment Financial Assistance Program, 45 percent to IFA for the Water Quality Financing Program, and 15 percent to DALS for the Water Quality Urban Infrastructure Program. This transfer of water service tax revenues to the Water Quality Financial Assistance Fund increases to one-sixth of revenues collected on or after August 1, 2019, but before August 1, 2020, and to one-half of revenues collected on or after August 1, 2020. For water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1, 2018, but before August 1, 2019, one-twelfth of the revenues are transferred to a Water Quality Infrastructure Fund to support the water quality agriculture infrastructure programs administered by DALS. This transfer of water service tax revenues to the Water Quality Infrastructure Fund increases to one-sixth of revenues collected on or after August 1, 2019, but before August 1, 2020. The Act also transfers, for FY 2020-2021 through FY 2028-2029, $15 million of wagering tax receipts each fiscal year to the Water Quality Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to support the water quality agriculture infrastructure programs. MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES. The Act defines \"Iowa nutrient reduction strategy\" and \"nutrient\" in Iowa Code section 455B.171, which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of the Iowa Code that concern the jurisdiction of DNR related to water quality, and also amends the definition of \"point source\" to exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture. The Act provides that it is the legislative intent of the General Assembly that this amendment to the definition of \"point source\" is a conforming amendment consistent with current state and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the application of current law but instead reflects current law both before and after enactment of the Act. The Act amends the declaration of policy for the DNR's water quality jurisdiction in Iowa Code section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by implementing the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, and further adds that progress under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan shall be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996. The Act amends Iowa Code section 466B.3, relating to the Water Resources Coordinating Council, to provide that when the Council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan shall be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996. ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROTECTION PROTECTION 109 The Act amends Iowa Code section 466B.42, relating to the Water Quality Initiative of DALS, to provide that its goal is to implement DALS's responsibilities under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, and to provide that progress under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan must be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996. The Act requests the Legislative Council to establish an interim study committee to identify and comprehensively review the financial and other challenges faced by small cities in complying with the various state and federal clean water standards and to consider options for addressing those challenges, and to review certain water quality programs created in the Act. The committee is required to seek input from a variety of stakeholders and experts and to submit findings for consideration during the next legislative session. Certain provisions of this Act were subsequently amended during the 2018 Legislative Session by HF 2440 (see Agriculture) and SF 2417 (see Taxation), including a number of the dates specified in this Act.

This Act relates to powers, duties, and related programs administered by the Department of Natural Resources, including the department's director and the Environmental Protection Commission. Under prior law, the commission must give an annual report to the Governor and General Assembly about the accomplishments and status of the programs of the department. That report will now be given on a biennial basis. CITY AND PUBLIC WORKS. The Act eliminates the director's duty to inspect work conducted by city and public works departments for water and sewage projects. The director is now required to review permits and reports regarding such work. RECYCLING. The Act creates a framework that allows the department to regulate speculative accumulation by a recycling facility. The definition for \"recycling\" is amended to reflect its relation to the new speculative accumulation provisions. The Act also creates definitions for \"recycling facility\" and \"scrap metal.\" The new provisions allow the department to seek compliance orders and issue civil penalties if it finds that a recycling facility is speculatively accumulating materials and it fails to demonstrate that the material can be recycled as a valuable product. Currently, the civil penalties that may be assessed for a violation pursuant to either Iowa Code section 455D.22 or 455D.25, cannot exceed $10,000 for each day that the violation continues. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. The Act transfers the Geological Survey from the department to the State University of Iowa under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Regents. The board is required to oversee the State Geologist, who will be subject to new qualifications. Some of the State Geologist's duties will change, including by making an annual report to the General Assembly in addition to the Governor. The State Geologist no longer has authority to lease or rent space for the storage of certain materials. The Geological Survey must make its publications available electronically. REPORTING. Since 2010, the department has had to submit a written report to the General Assembly regarding issues related to the collection and recycling of mercury-added thermostats in the state. The Act terminates this duty. REDEMPTION CENTER GRANT PROGRAM. The Act eliminates the independent redemption center grant program that awards grants for improvements to redemption centers that are not affiliated with or in any way a subsidiary of a dealer, distributor, or manufacturer and are either nonprofit or for-profit but have existed prior to July 1, 2008.

This Act relates to the Land Recycling Program administered by the Department of Natural Resources. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) authorizes states to establish state response programs in order to clean polluted sites. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement Between the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Region 7 of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the department's Land Recycling Program qualifies as a state response program. A person may voluntarily enroll real property into the program to avoid possible litigation and fines pursuant to CERCLA if the property is affected or may be affected by the release of a hazardous substance that poses environmental, health, or safety risks. Upon enrollment in the program, the participant must agree to carry out a response action designed to eliminate or reduce the risk. The participant must reimburse the department for the actual costs it incurs in reviewing documents that the owner submitted to enroll the site. The current reimbursement amount cannot exceed $7,500 per enrolled site. The Act increases that amount to not more than $25,000 per enrolled site for sites enrolled on or after July 1, 2018.

This Act creates a licensure process for behavior analysts and assistant behavior analysts. The Board of Behavioral Science regulates behavior analysts and assistant behavior analysts, with the former receiving two seats on the board and the latter one seat. A person may not use the title \"licensed behavior analyst\" or \"licensed assistant behavior analyst\" unless that person has received the appropriate license. However, persons licensed to practice other health-related professions, behavior analysts who practice with nonhumans, family members of recipients of applied behavior analysis services, paraprofessional technicians, persons who provide general applied behavior analysis services to organizations, applied behavior analysis students, behavior analysis teachers or researchers, behavior analysts licensed in other jurisdictions, or persons employed by a school board are exempt from the licensure requirement. The board may grant an applicant a license to practice as a behavior analyst when the applicant submits proof that the applicant has been certified as a behavior analyst or a behavior analyst-doctoral by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board or a similar entity accredited by the National Commission on Certifying Agencies of the American National Standards Institute. The board may grant an assistant behavior analyst's license to an applicant who submits proof that the applicant has been certified as an assistant behavior analyst by a certifying entity. The applicant must also submit proof of ongoing supervision by a licensed behavior analyst. The Act provides for the revocation of the license of a behavior analyst or assistant behavior analyst if the board finds that the licensee engaged in sexual activity with a client.

This Act prohibits and requires certain actions relating to a fetus. The Act is organized in divisions. Division I \u2014 Fetal Body Parts Division I of the Act relates to fetal body parts and prohibits a person from knowingly acquiring, providing, receiving, otherwise transferring, or using a fetal body part in the state, regardless of whether the acquisition, provision, receipt, transfer, or use is for valuable consideration. A person who violates this Iowa Code section is guilty of a class \"C\" felony. The prohibition does not apply to any of the following: diagnostic or remedial tests, procedures or observations which have the sole purpose of determining the life or health of the fetus to provide information to the pregnant woman or to preserve the life or health of the fetus or pregnant woman; the actions of a person taken in furtherance of the final disposition of a fetal body part; a pathological study of body tissue, including genetic testing, for diagnostic or forensic purposes; or a fetal body part if the fetal body part results from a spontaneous termination of pregnancy or still birth and is willingly donated for the purpose of medical research. The Act includes definitions of key terms including a definition of \"fetal body part.\" Division II \u2014 Abortion Prerequisites and Prohibitions \u2014 Fetal Heartbeat The division creates Iowa Code chapter 146C relating to a prohibition on abortions based upon the detection of a fetal heartbeat. The division provides definitions of terms used in the chapter including those for \"medical emergency,\" \"medically necessary,\" and \"unborn child.\" Iowa Code chapter 146A (Abortion Prerequisites) is amended to include a definition of \"medical emergency\" which is then referenced and is the same for new Iowa Code chapter 146C. The division provides that, except in the case of a medical emergency or when the abortion is medically necessary, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Iowa Code chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The division 120 HEALTH HEALTH HEALTH AND AND AND SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY prescribes the standards for testing for a fetal heartbeat, and provides that, following the test, a physician shall inform the pregnant woman, in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited. Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman is required to sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has received the required information. A physician shall retain documentation of the testing for a fetal heartbeat, the results of the test, and the pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant woman received the required information. A physician is prohibited from performing an abortion upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that a fetal heartbeat was detected, unless a medical emergency exists or when the abortion is medically necessary. However, notwithstanding the prohibition relating to the detection of a fetal heartbeat and the exceptions of a medical emergency or when an abortion is medically necessary under Iowa Code chapter 146C, if the physician determines that the probable postfertilization age, as defined in Iowa Code chapter 146B, of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks, the provisions of Iowa Code chapter 146C apply and the physician shall not perform an abortion on the pregnant woman when it has been determined that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat unless, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, the pregnant woman has a condition which the physician deems a medical emergency as defined in Iowa Code section 146B.1 or the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of an unborn child. The division is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division. The Board of Medicine is directed to adopt rules to administer the division.

The Act defines \"911 call processing equipment provider\" as a vendor selected by HSEMD to provide call processing equipment. The Act defines \"911 call transport provider\" as a vendor selected by HSEMD to deliver aggregated wire-line 911 call traffic to the NG911 and from such network to PSAPs. The Act defines \"NG911 service provider\" as a vendor selected by HSEMD to provide NG911 functionality. The Act modifies the definition of \"911 service plan\" by removing the identification of the agency responsible for the management of the 911 emergency communication system and equipment operated by local exchange service providers from the list of information required in such a plan. The Act also includes 911 call processing equipment and Internet and telephone access in the statement of estimated costs required in such a plan.

The Act modifies the definition of \"voice over Internet protocol service\" by specifying that such service must provide real-time two-way voice communications via internet protocol or a successor protocol. WIRE-LINE 911 SERVICE SURCHARGE. The Act requires a local exchange service provider to remit the wire-line service surcharge collected pursuant to Iowa Code section 34A.7 to the joint 911 service board instead of the 911 service operating authority. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE SURCHARGE.

Division I \u2014 Regulation of the Prescription Monitoring Program This division relates to regulation of the Iowa Information Program for Drug Prescribing and Dispensing, also known as the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP). The division requires first responders who administer opioid antagonists and prescribing practitioners who register to prescribe controlled substances to report to the PMP. Prescribing practitioners are required to utilize the PMP to assist in the treatment of patients with the exception of those patients receiving hospice care or long-term residential facility patient care. The division also requires a licensed pharmacy that dispenses a controlled substance, or a prescribing practitioner who dispenses a controlled substance to the prescribing practitioner's own patient, to report to the program the dispensing of the controlled substance within 24 hours of the dispensing. A pharmacist or prescribing practitioner who does not comply with program reporting, usage, or other requirements is subject to discipline by the appropriate professional licensing board. The division authorizes the Board of Pharmacy (board) to impose a surcharge on controlled substance registrations under Iowa Code chapter 124, which a person who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance 124 HEALTH HEALTH HEALTH AND AND AND SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY must obtain and maintain, to be deposited into the Drug Information Program Fund, and used for the expenses of administering the PMP. Division II \u2014 Electronic Prescriptions This division relates to electronic prescriptions. The division requires all prescriptions for prescription drugs to be transmitted to a pharmacy electronically, effective January 1, 2020. The division provides exemptions from this requirement in certain circumstances and provides alternative methods for the transmittal of prescriptions in those circumstances and for prescriptions transmitted prior to January 1, 2020. Prescriptions for controlled substances that are issued electronically must comply with federal law for the electronic transmittal of prescriptions for controlled substances. A person subject to the requirements of the division may petition the board for an exemption from the requirements of the division based on economic hardship, technical limitations, or other exceptional circumstances. Refills for prescription drugs and controlled substances must be transmitted in the same manner as initial prescriptions. Division III \u2014 Prescriber Activity Reports This division relates to the issuance of activity reports from the PMP to prescribing practitioners. The division requires the board and the PMP Advisory Council to promulgate rules allowing the annual issuance beginning February 1, 2019, and annually by February 1 thereafter, electronically and at as low a cost as possible, of activity reports to prescribing practitioners who prescribe any controlled substances. The reports would include information from the PMP, including a summary of the prescribing practitioner's history of prescribing controlled substances, comparisons to other prescribing practitioners of the same profession and specialty, the prescribing practitioner's history of program use, general patient risk factors, educational updates, and other pertinent information. The information provided to a prescribing practitioner in a report issued is privileged and confidential. Division IV \u2014 Substance Abuse Prevention This division relates to mitigating the abuse of opioids. The division allows the board and PMP Advisory Council to establish criteria for the identification of patients who are potentially misusing or abusing prescription controlled substances and authorizes the board to proactively notify the pharmacist and prescribing practitioner involved in the patient's care of its concerns. The division also directs professional boards that license prescribing practitioners that prescribe controlled substances to establish penalties for prescribing practitioners who prescribe controlled substances in an amount exceeding what would be prescribed by a reasonably prudent prescribing practitioner engaged in the same practice. The division also directs the appropriate licensing board to establish continuing education minimum requirements for practitioners who prescribed opioids to a patient during the previous licensure cycle. The division rescinds a Board of Medicine rule relating to training for chronic pain management for permanent or special license renewal. Division V \u2014 Registration This division relates to registration with the board by persons working with controlled substances. The division requires a person who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance in this state or who proposes to engage in such activities in this state (registrant) to obtain and maintain a registration issued by the board. Currently, a registrant is required to obtain and maintain a biennial registration issued by the board. The division requires a separate registration for each principal place of business of a registrant including when the registrant is conducting research with controlled substances. The division permits the board to take disciplinary action against a registrant who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance within Iowa, which may include, in addition to suspending, revoking, or restricting a registration, otherwise disciplining a registrant. The board may discipline a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material information in any application under any Iowa Code chapter which applies to the registrant. If the board restricts a registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed under seal. HEALTH HEALTH HEALTH AND AND AND SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY 125 The board must notify the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs of all orders restricting a registrant's registration or disciplining a registrant. If the board decides to suspend, restrict, or revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant, the board must serve notice upon the registrant. The board may suspend a registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an emergency adjudicative proceeding if the board finds there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare. Division VI \u2014 Controlled Substances \u2014 Precursor Substances This division relates to the classification of controlled substances. The division classifies nine substances as Schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a Schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling actions taken by the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, making certain penalties applicable for unauthorized actions relating to the substances. The division also classifies a substance as a precursor substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements, making certain penalties applicable to a person who furnishes or receives that substance for certain purposes subject to certain penalties. Division VI took effect May 14, 2018. Division VII \u2014 Good Samaritan Immunity This division relates to certain protections against arrest and prosecution for people seeking medical assistance for a drug-related overdose. The division provides that a person seeking treatment for a drug-related overdose or a person seeking medical treatment for a person experiencing a drug-related overdose cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possession of a controlled substance, delivery of a controlled substance without profit, violations of Iowa Code section 124.407 (Gatherings Where Controlled Substances Unlawfully Used \u2014 Penalties), or violations of Iowa Code section 124.414 (Drug Paraphernalia) on the basis of information collected or derived from a person's actions in seeking medical assistance if the person has not previously received such immunity. Such protected information shall also be inadmissible at trial for any of the enumerated offenses and shall not be used to revoke a person's pretrial release, probation, supervised release, or parole. The division only extends these protections to a person who acted in good faith seeking medical attention for themselves while experiencing a drug-related overdose or to a person who is an overdose reporter acting in good faith to seek medical assistance for an overdose patient in need of medical assistance for an immediate health or safety concern, when the person was the first person to seek medical assistance, provides the person's name and contact information to medical or law enforcement personnel, waits on the scene until assistance arrives or is provided, cooperates with law enforcement and medical personnel, and when medical assistance was not sought during the execution of an arrest warrant, search warrant, or other lawful search. The division also provides that a person's attempts to provide medical assistance to a person experiencing a drug-related overdose may be considered by the court as a mitigating factor in a criminal prosecution.

This Act adopts the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact. The compact allows a person holding a valid, unencumbered license to practice physical therapy in any member state to seek a compact privilege to practice physical therapy in any other member state, subject to the approval of that state and certain conditions that the state may impose. The state that granted a physical therapist a license to practice physical therapy retains exclusive authority to discipline that licensee, regardless of where the physical therapist practices. However, a state that has granted a compact privilege may take disciplinary action against that privilege and all member states may investigate violations of the statutes and rules governing the practice of physical therapy of any other member state. The compact is administered by a commission consisting of a delegate from the physical therapy licensing boards of each member state. The commission may create rules and bylaws relating to the compact, levy annual assessments and fees on member states to cover the operating costs of the commission, sue and be sued, intervene in legal matters concerning the commission, and appoint an executive board. The executive board may recommend to the commission changes to the rules governing the compact and shall manage the financial and administrative affairs of the commission. 126 HEALTH HEALTH HEALTH AND AND AND SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY The compact instructs the commission to create a database and reporting system containing licensure and investigative information on all licensed persons in member states. This information may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the member state supplying the information. The commission must inform all other member states when the commission determines that a member state is defaulting in the state's duties. The commission shall also offer proposed remedies for the default, including remedial training and technical assistance. If a member state fails to cure a default and all other remedies have been exhausted, that member state may be removed from the compact upon a majority vote of member states. A member state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact. Such a withdrawal takes effect six months after the enactment of such a statute.

A respondent who is the subject of an application for involuntary commitment for a substance-related disorder and who is taken into immediate custody shall be released from custody prior to a commitment hearing if a licensed physician or mental health professional examines the respondent and determines that the respondent no longer meets the criteria for custody and provides notification to the court. A hearing for a commitment order related to substance abuse or serious mental illness may be held by video conference at the discretion of the court. The Act requires the Department of Human Services to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute care facility if the department has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and staff are adequate to provide the care and services required of a subacute care facility. Current law provides mental health information may be disclosed under certain circumstances without the individual's consent or written authorization, including for certain administrative disclosures to other mental health providers, for administrative and professional services to the individual, to meet certain compulsory disclosure requirements pursuant to state or federal law, or to authorized family members. The Act provides that a mental health professional may disclose mental health information, at the minimum consistent with applicable laws and standards of ethical conduct, relating to an individual to a law enforcement professional if the disclosure is made in good faith, is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the individual or to a clearly identifiable victim or victims, and the individual has the apparent intent and ability to carry out the threat. Under the Act, a mental health professional shall not be held criminally or civilly liable for failure to disclose mental health information relating to an individual to a law enforcement professional except in circumstances where the individual has communicated to the mental health professional an imminent threat of physical violence against the individual's self or against a clearly identifiable victim or victims. The Act expands the definition of \"seriously mentally impaired\" to include a person who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because of that illness has a history of lack of compliance with treatment such that either the lack of compliance has been a significant factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or has resulted in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the person's self or others. The Act further provides that if a respondent has been ordered to undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury, a court shall order the person to be taken into physical custody.

The Act requires the court, in a criminal proceeding in which the sentence requires a defendant who is the subject of an immigration detainer request to be confined in a correctional facility, to issue an order providing for the transfer of the defendant to serve the final portion of the sentence in federal custody if a facility or officer determines that the change in the place of confinement will facilitate the seamless transfer of the defendant into federal custody. The Act provides for such a transfer without a transfer order under exigent circumstances. The Act prohibits a local entity, as defined in the Act, from adopting or enforcing a policy or taking any other action under which the local entity prohibits or discourages the enforcement of immigration laws. The Act prohibits a local entity from prohibiting or discouraging a person who is an official who is employed by or otherwise under the direction or control of the local entity from taking specified actions relating to the enforcement of immigration laws. The Act requires each state or local law enforcement agency, by January 1, 2019, to formalize in writing any unwritten, informal policies relating to the enforcement of immigration laws and to update the agency's policies to be consistent with the Act and to require full compliance with the Act by agency employees. The Act prohibits a local entity or employee thereof from considering race, skin color, language spoken, or national origin while enforcing immigration laws except to the extent permitted by the federal or Iowa constitution. The Act prohibits a local entity or employee thereof from asking for or collecting any information from a victim of or witness to an alleged public offense or from a person reporting an alleged public offense that is not pertinent to the investigation of the alleged public offense. The Act establishes a process whereby any person may file a complaint with the Attorney General alleging that a local entity has violated or is violating the Act if the complainant offers evidence to support such an allegation. If the Attorney General determines a complaint is valid, the Act requires the Attorney General to notify the local entity, and the local entity to provide the Attorney General with specified documentation relating to the complaint. The Act requires the Attorney General to file a civil action in district court to enjoin any ongoing violation of the Act. The Act provides a timeline for completing these actions. The Act provides that a local entity, including any entity under the jurisdiction of the local entity, shall be ineligible to receive any state funds if the local entity intentionally violates the Act, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. State funds shall continue to be denied until eligibility to receive state funds is reinstated as provided in the Act. State funds for wearable body protective gear shall not be denied in this way. The Act requires the Department of Management to adopt administrative rules to implement the denial and reinstatement of eligibility for state funds uniformly across state agencies from which state funds are distributed to local entities. The Act establishes a process whereby a local entity may petition in district court to seek a declaratory judgment that the local entity is in full compliance with the Act. If the court issues a judgment declaring the local entity's compliance, the local entity's eligibility to receive state funds is reinstated. The Act requires the Attorney General to develop and maintain a searchable online database listing each local entity which has been determined to be ineligible to receive state funds under the Act. The Act applies to the release of a person from custody in Iowa on or after July 1, 2018. The Act may include a state mandate as defined in Iowa Code section 25B.3. The Act makes the state mandate language inapplicable. Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with any state mandate included in the Act. 144 LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2059 2059 2059 - - - Electronic Electronic Electronic Delivery Delivery Delivery of of of Assessments, Assessments, Assessments, Notices, Notices, Notices, or or or Other Other Other Information Information Information by by by Local Local Local Assessors Assessors Assessors BY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

This Act amends competitive bidding requirements for construction of property that a government entity will lease-purchase or has committed to pay for prior to construction. Iowa Code chapter 26 (Public Construction Bidding) imposes public bidding requirements on certain public improvements that are estimated to cost above specified threshold amounts. The Act expands the definition of \"public improvement\" to include work that a governmental entity commits to pay for in whole or in part prior to construction. The Act also defines \"under the control of a governmental entity.\" LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT 145 The Act specifies that a contract for construction by a private party of a property to be lease-purchased by the State of Iowa, the State Board of Regents, a community college, a public school corporation, a county, or a city is a contract for a public improvement. Those entities must therefore take competitive bids for renovations, repairs, or new construction of the property to be lease-purchased if the cost exceeds the applicable competitive bid threshold. The Act applies to lease-purchase contracts entered into on or after April 4, 2018. However, pursuant to section 71 of HF 2502 (see Appropriations), the Act does not apply to lease-purchase contracts that resulted from a request for proposals or request for qualifications issued prior to the effective date of the Act by a city with a population of less than 21,000 according to the 2016 special census. The Act took effect April 4, 2018.

This Act concerns county supervisor representation and districting plans. Under Iowa law, county supervisors may be elected pursuant to plan \"one,\" election at large; plan \"two,\" election at large with district residence requirements; or plan \"three,\" election from single-member districts. The Act provides that the plan selected by the county board of supervisors can only be changed after the plan has been in effect for six years and only by a special election. In addition, the Act further provides that a county with a population of 60,000 or more that elects supervisors under plan \"three\" shall not change to plan \"two\" or plan \"one\" pursuant to a special election unless either alternative plan is adopted by a two-thirds vote. Concerning county supervisor districting plans, the Act provides for the manner of adopting redistricting plans for county supervisor districts for every county that has adopted a plan \"three\" form of representation. The procedure provides that the county's initial plan for districts, and the county's first plan for districts after each federal decennial census, shall be drawn by the Legislative Services Agency, based upon a precinct plan approved by the State Commissioner of Elections, for approval by the county board of supervisors. If the plan drawn by the Legislative Services Agency is rejected by the county board of supervisors, the board shall direct the Legislative Services Agency to prepare another plan which plan may be adopted or amended by the county board of supervisors.

The Act specifies that \"rented by the person\" includes a person who does not necessarily rent the land but who principally provides labor for the production of crops located on agricultural land or for the production of livestock principally located on agricultural land. The person must personally provide such labor on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis.

Division I \u2014 General FISHING, HUNTING, AND FUR HARVESTING LICENSES AND FEES. This division authorizes the commission to adopt rules that allow it to issue fishing, hunting, and fur harvesting licenses. The associated license fees must be periodically evaluated by the department, but not less than once every three years to ensure that the amounts paid are sufficient to meet the needs of natural resource management and the public. REPORT. The division provides that by December 15 of each year that an evaluation of license fees is completed, beginning with December 15, 2019, the department must file a written report with the commission and the General 150 NATURAL NATURAL NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES RESOURCES AND AND AND OUTDOOR OUTDOOR OUTDOOR RECREATION RECREATION RECREATION Assembly that includes the evaluation and recommendations for changes, if any. A fee increase proposed in such a report cannot take effect until on or after December 15 of the succeeding year and an individual license fee cannot be increased in any calendar year by more than 5 percent. PROPERTY TAXES. The division provides that income generated from land acquired with revenue from wildlife habitat fees and matched federal funds must be used to pay property taxes on that land and, if no income is generated, wildlife habitat fee revenue must be used to pay the taxes. Under prior law, the taxes were paid only with wildlife habitat fee revenue. HABITAT FEE. The division provides that $3 from each wildlife habitat fee must be allocated to game bird habitat development programs as specified in Iowa Code section 483A.3B and not less than 50 percent of the balance of each fee must be used by the commission to enter into agreements with county conservation boards or public agencies in order to carry out the purposes of Iowa Code section 483A.3, including acquiring rights to land used as wildlife habitat. An increase in wildlife habitat fees collected on or after December 15, 2018, as a result of the new rules must be used by the commission for any of the purposes set forth in Iowa Code section 483A.3 or 483A.3B, except that such increased amount in revenue cannot be used by the commission for land acquisition. Additionally, of the $3 collected from each wildlife habitat fee that is allocated to support game bird habitat development programs, not less than $2 must be allocated to the Game Bird Wetlands Conservation Account and not less than $1 must be allocated to the Game Bird Buffer Strip Assistance Account. ISSUANCE OF LICENSES. The division changes any references of three-year licenses to multi-year hunting and fishing licenses that may be issued by the commission on or after December 15, 2018.

The Iowa Code section allowing this license repeals on its own terms December 15, 2021. USE OF LICENSES. The division makes multiple changes to when certain licenses may be used. First, a youth hunter using a youth deer hunting license and tag to hunt deer pursuant to Iowa Code section 483A.8 may use the license and tag during any deer hunting season as long as the youth uses the method of take authorized by rule for the season. The license will expire if the tag is filled. Also, a free deer or turkey hunting license issued to an owner of a farm unit or the tenant pursuant to Iowa Code section 483A.24 will be valid during any bow or firearm hunting season for the respective game animal. Division II \u2014 Coordinating Amendments This division makes numerous coordinating amendments necessitated by the changes made in Division I that allow the commission to provide for the issuance of licenses and the establishment of fees. Additionally, the division amends Iowa Code section 483A.24 by providing that a nonresident who purchases a hunting license in conjunction with a deer or turkey hunting license must purchase an annual hunting license that includes the wildlife habitat fee. Division III \u2014 Transition Provisions and Effective Dates RULEMAKING. The division directs the commission to commence rulemaking procedures to establish fees by July 14, 2018, that must take effect December 15, 2018. EFFECTIVE DATES.

TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 169 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2303 2303 2303 - - - Inheritance Inheritance Inheritance Tax Tax Tax \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Payment Payment Payment Deferral Deferral Deferral \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Security Security Security Requirements Requirements Requirements BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. This Act modifies the types of security that may be given to secure inheritance tax payment in the case of a deferral of inheritance tax on deferred estates or remainder interests. An estate subject to the inheritance tax may contain a deferred estate or remainder interest, which generally occurs when property is transferred to a person for a certain period of time, and then to a different person (remainderman) at the expiration of that time. Under Iowa law, the inheritance tax accrues at the date of death of the decedent, but the payment of inheritance tax may be deferred for a remainderman until such time as the property actually passes to that person. When inheritance tax deferral is elected, current Iowa law requires that a bond be given to secure the payment of the tax unless the estate contains real property and the automatic lien on such real property is sufficient to secure payment of the deferred tax. The Act provides that, in lieu of a bond, an estate containing personal property, real property, or a mix of both, may provide other security to secure payment of the deferred tax. The other security must be satisfactory to the Department of Revenue (DOR). The Act includes as examples of other security the following: a bank or securities account with an irrevocable pay-on-death or transfer-on-death provision naming DOR as beneficiary, or an escrow agreement with DOR under which a private attorney will act as escrow agent and hold the escrow funds in the attorney's trust account. The Act applies to estates of decedents that include a deferred estate or remainder interest and that have not, on or before July 1, 2018, received approval from DOR to defer payment of the inheritance tax. SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2388 2388 2388 - - - Assessment Assessment Assessment and and and Taxation Taxation Taxation of of of Telephone Telephone Telephone and and and Telegraph Telegraph Telegraph Company Company Company Property Property Property BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS. Iowa Code chapter 433 requires the Department of Revenue to centrally assess the property (real and personal) of telegraph and telephone companies that is used by the companies in the transaction of telegraph and telephone business, provides for certain amounts of property value to be exempt from taxation, and establishes a process by which the valuation of the company is allocated to each county in the state into which a line of the company extends. This Act makes the current central assessment process under Iowa Code chapter 433 applicable to property tax assessment years beginning before January 1, 2022, and provides that telephone and telegraph company property shall be, for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, assessed by local assessors in the same manner and on the same basis as other commercial property located in the assessing jurisdiction. For the assessment years beginning January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, the Act provides an additional exemption from taxation on the value of each company's property following application of other exemptions. The exemption percentage is 25 percent, 50 percent, and 70 percent, respectively, for each of the specified assessment years until the property is subject to local assessment. Iowa Code section 427A.1 requires certain property to be assessed and taxed as real property. Transmission property, as defined in the Act, is excluded from being assessed and taxed as real property. This exclusion, however, is phased in during the assessment years beginning January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, until the value of the transmission property is completely excluded for assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The Act makes corresponding changes to various provisions of the Iowa Code relating to the central assessment of property under Iowa Code chapter 433, sunsets a property tax exemption for certain broadband infrastructure, and strikes a provision that allows certain specified long-distance telephone company property to be assessed for taxation as commercial property by the local assessor. The Act includes various effective date and applicability date provisions. 170 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION SENATE SENATE SENATE FILE FILE FILE 2407 2407 2407 - - - Sales Sales Sales and and and Use Use Use Tax Tax Tax \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Rebates Rebates Rebates to to to Raceway Raceway Raceway Facility Facility Facility Owners Owners Owners or or or Operators Operators Operators BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS. This Act modifies the tax rebate provided to the owners or operators of a raceway facility that meets certain requirements for sales and use tax related to purchases made and projects completed at the raceway facility. The Act strikes provisions allowing the tax rebate for state sales or use tax paid by a contractor in completion of one project at the raceway facility and strikes other provisions relating to the administration of that component of the tax rebate, including the limitation on the maximum tax rebate of 25 percent of the project's costs. The tax rebate will now be available only for state sales tax collected on purchases made at the raceway facility and will be limited by and calculated according to the amount of project costs at the raceway facility that are incurred and paid by the owner or operator on or after May 16, 2018, as substantiated to the Department of Revenue within 90 days of the date of payment. The Act also amends the definition of \"project costs\" and modifies the maximum total rebate limit to equal $1.8 million. The Act took effect May 16, 2018, and applies retroactively to January 1, 2015, for sales occurring on or after that date.

Division I \u2014 Interest Accrual on Certain Tax Refunds Iowa law provides that interest accrues and shall be paid to taxpayers on overpayments of several different types of tax administered by the Department of Revenue (DOR). The language for calculating interest on tax overpayments is found in several different provisions of the Iowa Code. Generally, interest begins to accrue in the second calendar month following the later of the date of the tax payment or the date the return was due to be filed or was filed. However, the language governing interest accrual was not entirely uniform. The Act provides that all Iowa taxes administered by DOR and which result in a refund shall begin to accrue interest in the second calendar month following the date of the tax payment or the date the return upon which the refund is claimed was due to be filed, including any extensions, or was filed, whichever is latest. The Act also defines \"return\" for purposes of Title X of the Iowa Code (Financial Resources) in new Iowa Code section 421.6. Division I took effect May 30, 2018, and applies retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and for refunds issued on or after that date. Division II \u2014 Tax Penalties Under current law in Iowa Code section 421.27(6), a person who makes an erroneous application for a refund or credit is liable for the overpayment received, plus interest. In addition, if the application is false or frivolous and made with intent to evade tax or receive a refund or credit, the person is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is liable for a 75 percent tax penalty. The Act amends Iowa Code section 421.27(6) to provide that these provisions also apply in the same manner to applications for a reimbursement, rebate, or other payment. Additionally, the Act amends Iowa Code section 425.29, relating to penalties for making false claims for the elderly and disabled property tax credit or rent reimbursement, to provide that DOR may impose penalties under Iowa Code section 421.27, which provides for several different tax penalties. Division II took effect May 30, 2018, and includes legislative intent language stating that the amendments in Division II are conforming amendments consistent with current state law. Division III \u2014 Miscellaneous Provisions The Act amends language governing the transfer of prepaid wireless 911 surcharges by DOR to the Treasurer of State, and the transfer of water service tax revenues by DOR to various funds for water quality programs, to TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 171 provide that such transfers are calculated using the reported surcharges or water service tax revenues, instead of the remitted amounts as required under prior law. The Act further amends the water service tax to provide that, for ease of administration, DOR may require water service tax liability to be identified, reported, and remitted to DOR as sales and use tax liability, provided DOR has the ability to properly identify such amounts as water service tax revenues upon receipt. The Act requires DOR to act on behalf of political subdivisions and the state to deliver certain responses to boundary and annexation surveys and to provide legal boundary geography data to the United States Census Bureau, and requires the Office of the Chief Information Officer to provide DOR with certain geographic information system (GIS) and technical support in performing such acts. The Act amends Iowa Code section 421.19, relating to the duty of the Attorney General and county attorneys to commence and prosecute certain actions on behalf of DOR, to provide that if DOR has information that indicates a taxpayer intentionally filed a false claim, affidavit, return, or other information with the intent to evade tax or obtain another benefit from DOR, DOR may notify and disclose certain state tax information to federal, state, and local law enforcement, notwithstanding the general confidentiality provisions of Iowa Code chapter 422. The Act prohibits a class action against DOR, a taxpayer, or any person required to collect an Iowa tax, based on any act or omission arising under Title X of the Iowa Code. The Act also provides that nothing in Title X of the Iowa Code shall be construed as creating or providing an implied private right of action or any private common law claim against a taxpayer or any person required to collect an Iowa tax, and that a taxpayer or any person required to collect an Iowa tax shall be immune from any private cause of action arising from or related to the overcollection of such taxes. The Iowa Election Campaign Fund Income Tax Checkoff previously provided taxpayers with the ability to direct $1.50 of the taxpayer's state tax liability to the Iowa Election Campaign Fund to be used by candidates for a partisan public office. In 2017, the General Assembly repealed the Iowa Election Campaign Fund Income Tax Checkoff for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The Act provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any amount of contribution of tax liability to the Iowa Election Campaign Fund designated on an individual income tax return for any tax year and filed on or after January 1, 2018, is void and shall be disregarded, and such contribution amount shall be credited to the General Fund and not to the Iowa Election Campaign Fund. This provision took effect May 30, 2018, and applies retroactively to January 1, 2018, for individual income tax returns filed on or after that date. Division IV \u2014 Tax Credits The Act extends by five years the final date that the Economic Development Authority Board may certify an innovation fund as eligible to participate in the Innovation Fund Investment Tax Credit from June 30, 2018, to June 30, 2023. The Act extends, by one year, the deadline for entering into withholding agreements under the Targeted Jobs Withholding Credit Pilot Project from June 30, 2018, to June 30, 2019. The Act modifies the research activities tax credits under the individual and corporate income tax by providing that the credits will only be available to businesses engaged in the manufacturing, life sciences, software engineering, or aviation and aerospace industry, and only to the extent the business claims and is allowed a research credit for such qualified research and expenses under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for the same taxable year it is claiming the state Research Activities Credit. The Act includes a nonexhaustive list of persons ineligible for the tax credits. These changes took effect May 30, 2018, and apply retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date. The Act further modifies the research activities tax credits under the individual and corporate income tax by amending the definition of \"base amount\" for purposes of calculating the credits. This amendment took effect May 30, 2018, and the Act includes legislative intent language stating that the amendments to the definition of \"base amount\" are conforming amendments consistent with current state law. 172 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION The Act increases the total amount of School Tuition Organization Tax Credits that may be issued per tax year to $13 million from $12 million for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Act also increases the household income limit at which a student is considered an \"eligible student\" under the School Tuition Organization Tax Credit Program from three times to four times the federal poverty amount for tuition grants provided on or after January 1, 2019. The Act repeals the Geothermal Tax Credit and the Geothermal Heat Pump Tax Credit on January 1, 2019, for tax years beginning on or after that date and for qualified geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or after that date. The Act requests the Legislative Council to authorize a study committee to meet during the 2019 Legislative Interim to evaluate tax credits available under Iowa law, consider new or different tax credits or incentives, and make recommendations for consideration during the 2020 Legislative Session. Division V \u2014 Taxpayers Trust Fund and Taxpayers Trust Fund Tax Credit The Act renames the Taxpayers Trust Fund as the Taxpayer Relief Fund and modifies the permitted use of trust fund moneys to include but not be limited to funding increases in the general retirement income exclusion under Iowa Code section 422.7(31) or reductions in income tax rates. The Act also repeals the Taxpayers Trust Fund Tax Credit for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. These provisions took effect May 30, 2018. Division VI \u2014 Taxpayers Trust Fund Transfer Cap Under prior law, the Taxpayers Trust Fund (now named the Taxpayer Relief Fund) received an annual transfer equal to the first $60 million of the difference between the actual net revenue and the adjusted revenue estimate for the state General Fund for a fiscal year, if any, after the Cash Reserve Fund and Iowa Economic Emergency Fund had been funded to their maximum balances. The Act strikes language limiting the Taxpayer Relief Fund transfer to $60 million, thereby resulting in an annual transfer to that fund equal to the total difference between the actual net revenue and the adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year, if any, after the Cash Reserve Fund and Iowa Economic Emergency Fund have been funded to their maximum balances. This division takes effect July 1, 2019, and is first applicable to calculate the state General Fund expenditure limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020. Division VII \u2014 Individual Income Tax Changes Beginning in Tax Year 2018 The federal Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) enacted by Congress in 2015 made permanent certain increased phase-out amounts and increased credit percentages of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that were scheduled to expire in 2018, made permanent the deduction for certain expenses incurred by elementary and secondary school teachers that was scheduled to expire in 2015, made permanent certain tax-free distributions to charities from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) that were set to expire in 2015, and made permanent the option to deduct sales and use taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes that was set to expire in 2015. The Act couples with these federal changes for purposes of the Iowa individual income tax for tax year 2018. The Act also couples for tax year 2018 with certain accounting method and other miscellaneous changes made in the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for purposes of the individual and corporate income taxes, and the franchise tax, to the extent those amendments affect the calculation of federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income for federal tax purposes for tax year 2018. These include amendments contained in the following sections of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: \u00a713102 (small business accounting method changes), \u00a713221 (accounting method rules for the taxable year of inclusion), \u00a713504 (Repeal of Technical Termination of Partnerships), \u00a713541 (electing small business trust), \u00a713543 (treatment of S corporation conversion to C corporation), \u00a713611 (repeal of special rule permitting recharacterization of Roth IRA conversions), and \u00a713613 (extended rollover period for qualified plan loans). These provisions apply retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on or after that date, but prior to January 1, 2019. TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 173 IRC \u00a7179 DEDUCTION. The IRC \u00a7179 deduction provides a tax deduction in lieu of depreciation for certain property placed in service during a tax year. Under prior law, for Iowa tax purposes, the maximum IRC \u00a7179 deduction per tax year was $25,000 (deduction limitation). This maximum deduction is incrementally reduced when a taxpayer's eligible property placed in service during the tax year exceeded $200,000 (investment limitation). The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made several changes to the IRC \u00a7179 deduction, including increasing the statutory maximum deduction to $1 million, increasing the statutory investment limitation to $2.5 million, and indexing these amounts to inflation to increase in future tax years. The Act couples for Iowa individual income tax purposes with the changes made to the IRC \u00a7179 deduction in the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 beginning in tax year 2018, but limits the maximum deduction and investment limitations to $70,000 and $280,000, respectively, for tax year 2018, and to $100,000 and $400,000, respectively, for tax year 2019. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the maximum deduction and investment limitation shall be the same as federal law, as adjusted for inflation. If the total IRC \u00a7179 deduction allocated to a taxpayer from one or more partnerships, S corporations, or limited liability companies exceeds the applicable amount described above for tax years 2018 or 2019, the Act allows the taxpayer to deduct the amount in excess of that amount evenly over a five-year tax period beginning in the subsequent tax year. Taxpayers who elect to take advantage of this provision are not allowed to take the IRC \u00a7179 deduction for the tax year of the election on any eligible property placed in service by the taxpayer, but are allowed to deduct depreciation on such property that would otherwise be allowable under federal law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance. These IRC \u00a7179 deduction provisions apply retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on or after that date. Division VII took effect May 30, 2018. Division VIII \u2014 Individual and Corporate Income Tax and Franchise Tax Changes Beginning in Tax Year 2019 Division VIII makes numerous changes to the income taxes and franchise tax beginning in tax year 2019. INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE CHANGES. Current law provides nine regular individual income tax brackets containing progressively higher amounts of taxable income that are taxed at progressively higher tax rates, from a low of 0.36 percent, to a high of 8.98 percent. The taxable income amounts in each tax bracket are indexed to inflation and increased each year. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, the Act reduces the tax rates in the individual income tax brackets to the following percentages: 0.33, 0.67, 2.25, 4.14, 5.63, 5.96, 6.25, 7.44, and 8.53. Current law provides four regular corporate income tax brackets containing progressively higher amounts of taxable income that are taxed at progressively higher tax rates, from a low of 6 percent, to a high of 12 percent. The taxable income amounts in each tax bracket are not indexed to inflation and are not increased each tax year. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, the Act sets the same tax rate for the first two tax brackets, effectively reducing the number of tax brackets to three, and reduces the tax rates in the tax brackets to the following percentages: 5.50, 9, and 9.80. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) COUPLING. Under prior law, with the exception of the Solar Energy Credit, the state Research Activities Credit, and the tax year 2018 changes described above, Iowa Code references to the IRC include the IRC in effect on January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made by Congress in 2015 through 2018 are not applicable for Iowa tax purposes, including revisions made in the PATH Act of 2015, the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Act adopts, or couples with, these revisions for purposes of the individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax for tax year 2019, except for certain revisions as described below. The coupling is accomplished generally by updating the definition of IRC as it applies to the income taxes to mean the IRC as amended and in effect on March 24, 2018. The updated definition does not apply to the state Solar Energy System Tax Credit in Iowa Code section 422.11L, which continues to have its own definition of IRC. 174 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the Act permanently couples with the IRC for the individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, which is often referred to as rolling conformity. This permanent coupling has the effect of automatically incorporating into Iowa tax law any future changes that may be made to the IRC, except for certain provisions as described below, unless the General Assembly were to affirmatively decouple from a particular provision through legislation. The adoption of rolling conformity does not apply to the state Solar Energy System Tax Credit in Iowa Code section 422.11L, which continues to have its own definition of IRC. INDIVIDUAL ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS. Iowa Code section 422.9 provided individuals a deduction from net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes. The deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa law beginning in tax year 2016. The federal deduction was made permanent by the PATH Act of 2015, and the Act couples with these federal changes to the deduction, thus making it permanent for tax year 2019 and beyond. The federal deduction for other taxes paid was limited to $10,000 per year under most circumstances by the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but the Act decouples from this limitation. Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct other taxes paid in computing state itemized deductions to the same extent as is otherwise allowed under state law, without regard to the $10,000 limitation described above. QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME DEDUCTION. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created a deduction in calculating federal taxable income for noncorporate taxpayers of up to 20 percent of certain domestic qualified business income earned by a taxpayer from a partnership, S corporation, limited liability company, other pass-through entity, or a sole proprietorship. This deduction was further amended by the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. The deduction is calculated under IRC \u00a7199A and includes numerous limitations based on the type of trade or business involved, the income of the trade or business, and the income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. The federal deduction applies to tax years 2018 through 2025, and is available to a taxpayer regardless of whether the taxpayer claims the standard deduction or itemized deductions for federal tax purposes. The Act provides a deduction in computing Iowa taxable income for purposes of the individual income tax equal to a certain percentage of the taxpayer's qualified business income deduction allowed for federal income tax. The applicable percentage is 25 percent for tax years 2019 and 2020, 50 percent for tax year 2021, and 75 percent for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. With regard to individuals, the Iowa deduction is available regardless of whether the individual claims the standard deduction or itemized deductions for Iowa tax purposes. With regard to an estate or trust, the starting point for calculating Iowa income tax will include the full amount of the federal qualified business income deduction, so the Act requires the estate or trust to add back certain percentages when calculating Iowa taxable income to arrive at the appropriate deduction. LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES. IRC \u00a71031 provides for a deferral of gain or loss resulting from exchanges of property that meet certain conditions. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed this provision with respect to exchanges of personal property. IRC \u00a71031 still provides for deferrals of gain or loss with respect to qualifying real property. The Act decouples, for Iowa individual income tax purposes, from the federal repeal of deferrals under IRC \u00a71031 for qualifying personal property for tax year 2019, and permits individuals to defer gain or loss on qualifying personal property for tax year 2019 to the extent such deferral would have been permitted under IRC \u00a71031 prior to its amendment by the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. BONUS DEPRECIATION DECOUPLING. The Act permanently decouples, for Iowa individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax purposes, from the federal additional first-year depreciation allowance in IRC \u00a7168(k) (bonus depreciation) which was extended and modified by the federal PATH Act of 2015 and the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. By decoupling, taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal tax purposes are required to add such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance. TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 175 IRC \u00a7179 DEDUCTION FOR CORPORATE INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES. The Act couples, for Iowa corporate income tax and franchise tax purposes, with the changes made to the IRC \u00a7179 deduction in the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act beginning in tax year 2019, but limits the maximum deduction and investment limitations to $100,000 and $400,000, respectively, for tax year 2019. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the maximum deduction and investment limitation shall be the same as federal law, as adjusted for inflation. If the total IRC \u00a7179 deduction allocated to a taxpayer from one or more partnerships or limited liability companies exceeds the applicable amount described above for tax year 2019, the Act allows the taxpayer to deduct the amount in excess of that amount evenly over a five-year tax period beginning in the subsequent tax year. Taxpayers who elect to take advantage of this provision are not allowed to take the IRC \u00a7179 deduction for the tax year of the election on any eligible property placed in service by the taxpayer, but are allowed to deduct depreciation on such property that would otherwise be allowable under federal law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance. CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (AMT). The Act amends the definition of \"IRC\" for purposes of the Iowa corporate AMT to mean the IRC in effect on December 21, 2017. This is the date immediately prior to the enactment date of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which repealed the federal corporate AMT. The Act repeals the Iowa corporate AMT for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. A corporation is allowed to claim any remaining AMT credit against its regular tax liability for tax year 2021, and the Act then repeals the corporate AMT credit on January 1, 2022, for tax years beginning on or after that date. CORPORATE FEDERAL DEDUCTIBILITY. The Act repeals the ability of corporations to deduct 50 percent of federal income taxes paid for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, and further limits the deduction prior to the repeal to only apply to federal taxes paid, or refunds received, that relate to a tax year beginning prior to January 1, 2021. Division VIII takes effect January 1, 2019, and applies to tax years beginning on or after that date. Division IX \u2014 Future Contingent Individual and Corporate Income Tax and Franchise Tax Changes Division IX makes numerous changes to the individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax beginning in tax year 2023 or in a later tax year, contingent upon the satisfaction of certain net General Fund revenue amount and growth targets. CONTINGENT EFFECTIVE DATE AND NET GENERAL FUND REVENUES CALCULATION. The Act institutes the changes described below for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, if the net General Fund revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, equal or exceed $8,314,600,000, and also equal or exceed 104 percent of the net General Fund revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. If these conditions are not satisfied, the Act institutes the changes for tax years beginning on or after the January 1 following the first fiscal year for which the net General Fund revenues equal or exceed $8,314,600,000, and also equal or exceed 104 percent of the net General Fund revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30 immediately preceding that fiscal year. The Act defines \"net general fund revenues\" and requires the Department of Management (DOM) to calculate such amounts each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2020, until such time as the revenue targets described above are satisfied. DOM is also required to promulgate rules and issue reports related to the calculation of net General Fund revenues. For purposes of describing the tax changes below, \"trigger year\" refers to the first tax year for which the tax changes become effective as described above, whether that be tax year 2023, or some later tax year. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES . The Act reduces the number of individual income tax brackets to four from nine, and modifies the taxable income amounts and tax rates as follows: Income over: But not $75,000 5.70% 4) $75,000 6.50% For a married couple filing a joint return, the taxable income amounts in each bracket above are doubled. Also, the taxable income amounts in each bracket above will be indexed to inflation and increased in future tax years, beginning in the tax year following the trigger year. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX CALCULATION. Under current law, the starting point for computing the Iowa individual income tax is federal adjusted gross income before the net operating loss deduction, which is generally a taxpayer's gross income minus several deductions. From that point, Iowa requires several adjustments and then provides taxpayers with a deduction for federal income taxes paid, and the option to deduct a standard deduction or itemized deductions. The Act changes the starting point for computing the individual income tax to federal taxable income, which includes all deductions and adjustments taken at the federal level in computing tax, including a standard deduction or itemized deductions, and the new qualified business income deduction allowed for certain income earned from a pass-through entity. Because the starting point will be federal taxable income, and federal law does not provide for the filing status of married filing separately on a combined return, the Act repeals that filing status option for Iowa tax purposes. Because net operating loss will no longer be calculated at the state level, the Act requires taxpayers to add back any federal net operating loss deduction carried over from a taxable year beginning prior to the trigger year, but allows taxpayers to deduct any remaining Iowa net operating loss from a prior taxable year. The Act repeals the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT), allows an individual to claim any remaining AMT credit against the individual's regular tax liability for the trigger year, and then repeals the AMT credit in the tax year following the trigger year. The Act repeals most Iowa-specific deductions, exemptions, and adjustments currently available when computing net income and taxable income under Iowa law, including the Iowa optional standard deduction and all itemized deductions, and the ability to deduct federal income taxes, except for a one-year phase-out in the trigger year for taxes paid, or refunds received, that relate to a prior year. The Act maintains the add-back for income from securities that are federally exempt but not state exempt, and for bonus depreciation amounts. The Act maintains the general pension exclusion and the deduction for income from federal securities. The Act maintains the deduction for contributions to the Iowa 529 plan, the Iowa ABLE plan, a first-time homebuyer savings account, and an individual development account. The Act also maintains the deductions for military pension income, military active duty pay, social security retirement benefits, certain payments received for providing unskilled in-home health care, certain amounts received from the Veterans Trust Fund, victim compensation awards, biodiesel production refunds, certain wages paid to individuals with disabilities or individuals previously convicted of a felony, certain organ donations, and Segal AmeriCorps Education Award payments. The Act modifies the existing deduction for health insurance payments in Iowa Code section 422.7(29) to make the deduction only applicable to taxpayers who are at least 65 years old and who have net income below $100,000. The Act also modifies the existing capital gain deduction in Iowa Code section 422.7(21) to restrict the deduction to the sale of real property used in a farming business, provided the taxpayer materially participated in the farming business for at least 10 years, held the real property for at least 10 years, and sold the real property to a relative. The Act defines various terms applicable to the modified capital gain deduction, and includes rules disallowing the deduction in certain cases for real property that is subsequently transferred within five years to a person who is not a relative of the taxpayer. The Act provides a new deduction for any income of an employee resulting from the payment by an employer, whether paid to the employee or a lender, of principal or interest on the employee's qualified education loan. Federal income tax law does provide a limited deduction for a taxpayer's payment of interest on qualified education loans, and the Act disallows the new Iowa deduction for any amount of income that represents an interest payment that was also deducted by the employee in computing federal taxable income. The Act defines \"qualified education loan.\" TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 177 The Act also modifies the calculation of net income for purposes of the alternate tax calculation in Iowa Code section 422.5(3) and (3B), and the tax return filing thresholds in Iowa Code section 422.13, to require that any amount of itemized deduction, standard deduction, personal exemption deduction, or qualified business income deduction that was allowed in computing federal taxable income shall be added back. CORPORATE INCOME TAX AND FRANCHISE TAX CALCULATION. Under current law, the starting point for calculating the corporate income tax and franchise tax is federal taxable income before the net operating loss deduction, because net operating loss is calculated at the state level. The Act repeals the separate calculation of net operating loss at the state level. As a result, the Act requires taxpayers to add back any federal net operating loss deduction carried over from a taxable year beginning prior to the trigger year, but allows taxpayers to deduct any remaining Iowa net operating loss from a prior taxable year. The Act also repeals most Iowa-specific deductions, exemptions, and adjustments currently available when computing net income and taxable income under Iowa law. The Act maintains the add-back for income from securities that are federally exempt but not state exempt, and for bonus depreciation amounts. The Act maintains the deductions for income from federal securities, for foreign dividend and subpart F income, for certain wages paid to individuals with disabilities or individuals previously convicted of a felony, and for biodiesel production refunds. Division X \u2014 Changes to Iowa Educational Savings Plan Trust and Iowa ABLE Savings Plan Trust Division X makes several changes to the Iowa Educational Savings Plan Trust in Iowa Code chapter 12D (Iowa 529 plan), the Disabilities Expenses Savings Plan Trust in Iowa Code chapter 12I (Iowa ABLE plan), and the income tax treatment of contributions to and withdrawals from such plans. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended IRC \u00a7529, which governs state tuition programs, to provide that during each year, up to $10,000 of cash distributions from all qualified tuition programs for a beneficiary for tuition expenses in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school, may be considered a distribution for qualified higher education expenses and thus excludable from income for federal income tax purposes. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also provided that under certain conditions, amounts in qualified tuition programs may be transferred to a qualified ABLE account without incurring federal income tax consequences. The Act amends the Iowa 529 plan to provide for qualified withdrawals from the plan for elementary or secondary school tuition as is now allowed under federal law pursuant to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Act modifies the purpose of the Iowa 529 plan to include the funding of formal education needs, and modifies various other provisions of the Iowa 529 plan to more generally reference education and educational institutions, instead of specifically referencing higher education and institutions of higher education. The Act strikes the definition of and references to \"higher education costs\" and replaces them with the term \"qualified education expenses,\" which is defined in the Act to mean the same as qualified higher education expenses as defined in IRC \u00a7529, including elementary and secondary school tuition to the extent such tuition amounts are described and allowed under IRC \u00a7529. The Act also replaces numerous references to \"institution of higher education\" throughout the Iowa 529 plan with references to a \"qualified educational institution,\" which is defined in the Act to include an institution of higher education and any elementary or secondary, public, private, or religious school described in IRC \u00a7529. The Act amends the Iowa 529 plan to provide for transfers from an Iowa 529 plan to an ABLE account. The Iowa 529 plan is further amended to allow the transfer of funds to another account in the Iowa 529 plan, if the transfer is permitted under IRC \u00a7529. Several other modifications are made to the Iowa 529 plan to remove references to the imposition of penalties for cancellation and late payments under the trust, to remove certain references to the ability to amend participation agreements, to describe rules and procedures for determining account successors in the case of death of a participant, and to modify the permissible investment direction that may be provided by participants and 178 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION beneficiaries under the trust. Finally, the Act adds Iowa 529 plan accounts to the list of exemptions from execution under Iowa Code section 627.6. Prior law in Iowa Code section 422.7(32)(c) required tax-deducted contributions to an Iowa 529 plan that are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment of qualified education expenses to be added back to income in computing Iowa individual income tax. The Act amends this provision to require that such tax-deducted contributions be added back to Iowa income unless the amount is a withdrawal or transfer for one of three eligible purposes. First, for the payment of qualified higher education expenses, as defined under IRC \u00a7529. Second, for the payment of tuition to an elementary or secondary school in this state that meets certain requirements if the tuition amounts are qualified education expenses. Third, for transfers or beneficiary changes within the Iowa 529 plan, or a transfer to the Iowa ABLE plan, provided such beneficiary change or transfer is permitted under the Iowa 529 plan. This provision applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Act also amends the income tax treatment of contributions to and withdrawals from the Iowa ABLE plan to provide that a contribution shall not be deducted from Iowa income tax to the extent it represents a transfer from the Iowa 529 plan that was previously deducted as a contribution to the Iowa 529 plan, and that amounts resulting from a cancellation or withdrawal from the Iowa ABLE plan for purposes other than the payment of qualified disability expenses shall be added back to income in computing Iowa individual income tax to the extent the amount was previously transferred from the Iowa 529 plan and deducted as a contribution to the Iowa 529 plan. This provision applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The division took effect May 30, 2018, and applies retroactively to January 1, 2018, for withdrawals and transfers from the Iowa Educational Savings Plan Trust made on or after that date. Division XI \u2014 Sales and Use Taxes Division XI makes numerous changes to the sales and use taxes, including the local option sales tax. SPECIFIED DIGITAL PRODUCTS. The Act imposes the sales and use tax at a rate of 6 percent on the sale or use of specified digital products in Iowa. The Act defines \"specified digital products\" as electronically transferred digital audio-visual works, digital audio works, digital books, or other digital products. These and other related terms are also defined in the Act. The sales or use tax applies whether the purchaser obtains permanent use or less than permanent use of the specified digital product, whether the sale or use is conditioned or not conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser, and whether the sale or use is on a subscription basis or is not on a subscription basis. The Act also provides that the sale or use of digital code that may be used to obtain or access a specified digital product at a later date is taxed in the same manner as a specified digital product. The Act creates an exemption for the sale or use of specified digital products to a non-end user, as defined in the Act. The Act also amends numerous existing sales and use tax exemptions to include specified digital products. The Act makes certain other conforming amendments related to the treatment of specified digital products for purposes of the administration of the sales and use taxes. The Act provides that the imposition of tax on the sale or use of specified digital products shall not be construed as affecting the taxability or nontaxability under other provisions of existing law of sales or uses occurring prior to May 30, 2018, of products meeting the definition of \"specified digital products.\" SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PAY TELEVISION SERVICE. The Act amends the definition of \"sale\" for purposes of the sales tax to provide that a sale includes but is not limited to any transfer, exchange, or barter on a subscription basis. The Act defines \"subscription.\" The Act also amends the taxable service of pay television to provide that pay television includes but is not limited to streaming video, video on-demand, and pay-per-view. The Act includes legislative intent language stating that these amendments are conforming amendments consistent with current state law. These changes took effect May 30, 2018. TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 179 OTHER CHANGES TO TAXABLE SERVICES. Under prior law, the services of photography and retouching are subject to the sales and use tax, but such services were taxed as if they were sales of tangible personal property. The Act strikes these provisions and adds photography and retouching to the list of enumerated services subject to the sales and use tax. This change takes effect July 1, 2018. Prior law provided that a limousine service was subject to the sales and use tax. The Act modifies this service to provide that a personal transportation service shall be subject to the sales and use tax, and includes taxis, driver services, ride sharing services, rides for hire, and limousine services as examples of the types of services which qualify as a taxable personal transportation service. The Act also creates a sales and use tax exemption for transportation services furnished by emergency or nonemergency medical transportation, by a paratransit service, and by public transit systems. Under prior law, the furnishing of information services was exempt from the sales and use tax. The Act strikes this exemption, makes information services a taxable service for purposes of the sales and use tax, and defines \"information services.\" The Act adds the following services to the list of enumerated services subject to the sales and use tax: storage of tangible or electronic files, documents, or other records; services arising from or related to installing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, operating, upgrading, or enhancing specified digital products; video game services and tournaments; and software as a service. OTHER SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS. Prior law provided sales and use tax exemptions for access charges related to online computer services, and for any retail sale delivered electronically. The Act repeals both of these exemptions. The Act creates a sales and use tax exemption for certain sales to a commercial enterprise for use exclusively by the commercial enterprise. The exemption specifies that such a use fails to qualify as a use exclusively by the commercial enterprise if its use for noncommercial purposes is more than de minimis. The Act defines \"commercial enterprise,\" and provides that the terms \"de minimis\" and \"noncommercial purposes\" shall be defined by the Director of Revenue by rule. The exemption applies to sales of specified digital products, prewritten computer software, and to the furnishing of the following enumerated taxable services: storage of tangible or electronic files, documents, or other records; information services; services arising from or related to installing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, operating, upgrading, or enhancing specified digital products; and software as a service. The Act amends several definitions related to the manufacturing and equipment sales and use tax exemption in Iowa Code section 423.3(47). The definition of \"commercial enterprise\" is amended to, among other changes, strike language referencing centers for data processing services. The definition of \"manufacturer\" is amended to require that a business be primarily engaged in manufacturing in order to qualify for the exemption. The definition includes several examples of activities that do and do not qualify as manufacturing for purposes of the exemption. SALES AND USE TAX NEXUS AND COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS. The Act makes several modifications to the requirements of persons to collect and remit the state sales and use taxes and the local option sales tax. Current law requires retailers to collect sales tax for taxable items sold at retail in the state. The Act defines \"sold at retail in the state\" and other similar terms to include but not be limited to sales sourced to this state under Iowa Code chapter 423 (sales and use tax), and includes legislative intent language stating that the definition of \"sold at retail in the state\" is a conforming amendment consistent with current state law. These provisions related to the definition of \"sold at retail in the state\" took effect May 30, 2018. Under current law, Iowa Code section 423.15 provides general rules for the sourcing of sales to Iowa. The Act amends a provision in this Iowa Code section relating to when sales tax applies to a sale sourced to Iowa, to provide that Iowa sales tax applies to a sale sourced to Iowa made by a seller who is a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, or who is subject to the new Iowa Code section 423.14A (described below). The Act also amends provisions relating to the requirement of retailers maintaining a place of business in this state to collect use 180 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION tax in Iowa Code sections 423.14 and 423.29, to provide that use tax shall be collected by retailers not otherwise required to collect sales tax under Iowa Code chapter 423. Under current law in Iowa Code section 423B.5, the local sales and services tax is applicable to transactions within the areas of the county imposing the tax. The Act amends this provision to provide that a transaction occurring within the taxing area includes a sale sourced to a location in that area pursuant to the sourcing rules governing the sales and use tax (Iowa Code sections 423.15 through 423.20). The Act creates new Iowa Code section 423.14A that deems certain persons, or agents of those persons, to be retailers and retailers maintaining places of business in this state on or after January 1, 2019, and subjects those persons to all requirements of Iowa Code chapter 423 (sales and use taxes), including but not limited to the requirement to collect and remit Iowa sales and use tax, and the requirement to collect and remit the local option sales tax. The Act provides that the requirements in Iowa Code section 423.14A are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other application of Iowa Code chapter 423 to a retailer or a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state. Qualifying persons required to collect and remit Iowa sales and use tax include any of the following: (1) Any retailer that has gross revenue from Iowa sales equal to or exceeding $100,000 for a current or previous calendar year. (2) Any retailer that makes Iowa sales in 200 or more separate transactions for a current or previous calendar year. (3) Any retailer that owns, licenses, or uses \"software or data files\" (as defined in the Act) that are installed or stored on property used in this state, or that uses \"in-state software\" (as defined in the Act) to make Iowa sales, or that provides, or enters into an agreement to provide, a \"content distribution network\" (as defined in the Act) in this state to facilitate, accelerate, or enhance the delivery of the retailer's Internet site to purchasers. However, these provisions do not apply to any retailer that has gross revenue from Iowa sales of less than $100,000 for a current or previous calendar year. (4) Any \"marketplace facilitator\" (as defined in the Act) that makes or facilitates Iowa sales on its own behalf or for marketplace sellers (as defined in the Act) equal to or exceeding $100,000, or in 200 or more separate transactions, for a current or previous calendar year. The Act requires marketplace facilitators to collect Iowa sales and use tax on the entire sales price or purchase price paid by the purchaser, regardless of the amount that will ultimately accrue to or benefit the marketplace facilitator or any other person. The Act also provides certain limited tax collection liability relief, and includes other provisions related to marketplace facilitators. (5) Any \"referrer\" (as defined in the Act) that makes referrals of Iowa sales transactions equal to or exceeding $100,000, or in 200 or more separate transactions, for a current or previous calendar year. The Act relieves a referrer from tax collection responsibilities if the referrer posts certain notices on each platform (as defined in the Act) of the referrer, and provides certain periodic notices to marketplace sellers and DOR as described in the Act. (6) Any retailer that makes Iowa sales through the use of a \"solicitor\" (as defined in the Act). The Act creates a presumption that a retailer has a solicitor in this state under certain circumstances. This provision does not apply to retailers that have gross revenue from Iowa sales referred by solicitors of $10,000 or less for a current or previous calendar year. (7) Any person who owns, controls, rents, licenses, makes available, or uses any tangible or intangible property in this state or with a situs in this state to make or facilitate a retail sale. (8) Any person who enters into a contract or agreement with a \"governmental entity\" (as defined in the Act) including but not limited to contracts or agreements for the provision of financial assistance or incentives such as a tax credit, forgivable loan, grant, tax rebate, or any other thing of value. This provision includes certain requirements for contractors who submit bids and agreements to state agencies similar to language in prior Iowa Code section 423.2(10). The Act strikes the similar language under prior law in Iowa Code section 423.2(10). TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 181 (9) Any affiliate of any person that is required to collect Iowa sales and use tax, provided the affiliate makes retail sales. SALES AND USE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Act gives DOR the authority to adopt rules establishing and imposing notice and reporting requirements related to Iowa sales for retailers who do not collect and remit Iowa sales and use tax. The rules may include requirements to provide purchasers with sale notices and periodic reports, and to provide DOR with annual reports. The Act also gives DOR the authority to adopt and impose penalties for failures to comply with the notice and reporting requirements, and sets certain guidelines and maximum fine amounts related to the penalties. OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SALES AND USE TAX CHANGES. The Act moves provisions relating to the deposit and transfer of sales tax revenues in Iowa Code section 423.2(11) to a new Iowa Code section 423.2A, and makes corresponding changes to other provisions of the Iowa Code that reference those deposit and transfer provisions. The Act amends the definitions of \"lease or rental,\" \"retailer,\" \"use,\" \"use tax,\" and \"user\" for purposes of the sales and use tax. The Act also amends the definition of \"bundled transaction\" in Iowa Code section 423.2(8) to incorporate certain language also included in the definition of \"bundled transaction\" for purposes of the streamlined sales and use tax agreement, of which Iowa is a member state. The changes to the definition of bundled transaction take effect July 1, 2018. The Act defines \"personal property\" for purposes of the sales and use tax to include but not be limited to tangible personal property and specified digital products. The Act amends the definition of \"place of business\" for purposes of the sales and use tax to include places where specified digital products or services are offered for sale, and includes legislative intent language stating that the amendment to this definition is a conforming amendment consistent with current state law. These changes to the definition of \"place of business\" took effect May 30, 2018. The Act provides that when any retailer required under Iowa law to collect and remit sales and use tax fails to do so, the retailer and any affiliate that directly, indirectly, or constructively controls the retailer shall be held jointly and severally liable for the tax and any resulting penalty and interest, regardless of whether the affiliate is a retailer. The Act provides DOR the authority to assess the full amount of any tax, penalty, or interest against the retailer and these affiliates, and gives DOR discretion to disregard or look through any organizational structure of an enterprise to assess tax, penalty, and interest against an affiliate of a retailer. The term \"affiliate\" for purposes of these provisions is defined under existing law in Iowa Code section 423.1(2). Finally, the Act adds several Iowa Code sections relating to the requirement to collect sales and use tax to the provisions for which failure to comply may subject a retailer to personal liability under Iowa Code section 421.26. EFFECTIVE DATE PROVISIONS. Except as otherwise provided above, Division XI takes effect January 1, 2019. Division XII \u2014 Approval and Imposition of Local Option Sales and Services Tax Division XII of the Act relates to the approval and imposition of the local option sales and services tax. Under current law, such a proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in the county who voted at the last preceding general election or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county, representing at least one-half of the population of the county. The Act amends the methods of seeking presentment of the question of imposing a local option sales and services tax to the voters of cities, or portions thereof, in a qualified county and to the voters of the unincorporated area of a qualified county by allowing the eligible electors of cities, or applicable portion thereof, and the eligible electors of the unincorporated area of a qualified county to file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning jurisdiction. The Act also allows such an election in the applicable portions of a qualified county to be initiated by motion adopted 182 TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION by the governing body of the city or the county for the unincorporated area of the county, as applicable. The Act defines \"qualified county\" to mean a county with a population in excess of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010 federal decennial census. Iowa Code chapter 423B requires that all cities contiguous to each other be treated as part of one incorporated area and specifies that the tax is imposed in each of those contiguous cities only if a majority of those voting on the tax in the total area covered by the contiguous cities favored its imposition. The Act provides that the treatment of contiguous cities as one incorporated area for the purpose of determining whether a majority of those voting favors imposition does not apply to elections on the question of imposition of a local sales and services tax in all or a portion of a county that is a qualified county if the election occurs on or after January 1, 2019. The Act provides for the repeal of the local sales and services tax imposed in a city, or portion thereof, in a qualified county if the tax was initiated under the procedures authorized in the Act following the adoption of a motion by the governing board of the city requesting the repeal. The Act provides that each city located in whole or in part in a qualified county and each qualified county for the unincorporated area for which the imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at election on or after January 1, 2019, shall use not less than 50 percent of the moneys received from the qualified county's account for property tax relief. Iowa Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1 percent. The Act requires a local sales and services tax, if imposed, to be 1 percent. Division XII of the Act takes effect January 1, 2019. Division XIII \u2014 Hotel and Motel Excise Tax and Automobile Rental Excise Tax The Act amends the hotel and motel excise tax in Iowa Code chapter 423A and the automobile rental excise tax in Iowa Code chapter 423C to expand the types of persons who must collect and remit the excise taxes, and to make other changes to the administration of the taxes. Prior law required lessors, as defined with respect to each excise tax, to collect the excise taxes. The Act renames \"lessor\" as \"lodging provider\" and \"automobile provider\" under each respective tax and further modifies each definition to generally include persons that own, operate, or manage lodging or an automobile, or who possess or acquire a right in any lodging or automobile with an intent to rent the lodging or automobile. The Act also imposes collection and remittance requirements on a \"lodging facilitator\" and \"rental facilitator,\" \"rental platform.\" The facilitator terms are defined in the Act to generally include persons that facilitate rentals of lodging or automobiles and collect or process the sales price. The platform terms are defined in the Act to generally include persons that facilitate rentals of lodging or automobiles by owning, operating, or controlling a marketplace to allow others to offer or list lodging or automobiles for rent, and who collect or process the sales price. However, with respect to the automobile rental excise tax, a rental platform that operates a peer-to-peer automobile sharing marketplace and whose only sales subject to the sales tax under Iowa Code chapter 423 are vehicle rentals is not required to collect and remit the automobile rental excise tax. The Act also provides that a lodging facilitator and a rental facilitator are not required to collect the taxes if their total sales from both excise taxes is equal to or less than $10,000, or made in 10 or fewer transactions, for a current or previous calendar year. The Act generally requires that both excise taxes, when collected, shall be remitted directly to DOR. However, unless otherwise ordered by DOR, a lodging facilitator and a rental facilitator are obligated to remit certain portions of the tax to the ultimate lodging provider or rental provider, who is then required to remit such taxes to DOR together with any other taxes collected by that person. The Act includes certain immunities from assessment for taxes remitted between facilitators and providers, and includes tax collection and remittance rules for rental transactions that are part of a travel package. TAXATION TAXATION TAXATION 183 The Act modifies the definition of \"sales price\" for purposes of the hotel and motel excise tax and \"rental price\" with respect to the automobile rental excise tax, and defines certain terms used within those definitions. The Act repeals an exemption from the hotel and motel excise tax provided for the renting of rooms in a memorial union of an Iowa college or university, and expands an exemption for the renting of rooms in certain religious institutions so that it also applies to the state and local hotel and motel excise tax. Under prior law, that exemption only applied to the local hotel and motel excise tax. The Act modifies the definition of \"lodging\" for purposes of the hotel and motel excise tax to include a cabin, apartment, or residential property, and further modifies the types of rooms excluded from the definition of lodging to specify that it be a conference, meeting, or banquet room. The Act includes legislative intent language stating that these amendments are conforming amendments consistent with current state law. These changes to the definition of \"lodging\" took effect May 30, 2018. EFFECTIVE DATE PROVISIONS. Except as otherwise provided above, Division XIII takes effect January 1, 2019. HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE FILE FILE FILE 2478 2478 2478 - - - Sales Sales Sales Tax Tax Tax \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Construction Construction Construction Machinery, Machinery, Machinery, Equipment, Equipment, Equipment, Attachments, Attachments, Attachments, and and and Replacement Replacement Replacement Parts Parts Parts BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS. This Act relates to the sales tax imposed on certain construction equipment. Iowa Code section 423.3(37) exempts the lease or rental of certain construction equipment from the sales tax (construction equipment exemption). Also, Iowa Code section 423.3(2) exempts the purchase of tangible personal property for subsequent resale, lease, or rental from the sales tax (sale-for-resale exemption).

This Act gives the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the ability to grant certain extensions for completion of housing projects under the Workforce Housing Tax Incentives Program (program). Under prior law, in order to qualify for tax incentives under the program, a housing business had to complete its housing project within three years from the date the housing project was registered by IEDA. The Act provides that IEDA may for good cause extend this three-year deadline once for up to 12 months, provided the housing business applies to IEDA prior to the expiration of the three-year project completion deadline for its housing project. However, the Act also provides that notwithstanding this application deadline, a written request by a housing business to extend its housing project's completion deadline shall be considered a timely extension application if the written request is received by IEDA prior to August 1, 2018, and the housing business provides additional information if requested by IEDA. The Act applies to housing projects registered under the program prior to, on, or after July 1, 2018.
