In Oregon, Medicaid policy aligns with this standard. Coordinated care organizations (CCOs) are to provide evidencebased care that supports prevention, including services recommended by Bright Futures.2 Bright Futures provides two types of guidance: the periodicity schedule3 provides recommendations for the frequency of well visits and screenings conducted within well visits; and the guidelines4 provide comprehensive recommendations on specific components of care. Anticipatory guidanc e is provid ed for each stage in adolescent development: early adolescence (1114 years) middle adolescence (1517 years) and late adolescence (1821). Guidance will vary based upon the needs of each stage of development. For the purposes of this document, the term \"adolescent\" will refer to all young people from 11 21. Bright Futures identifies the following priority topics for adolescent well care visits5: Physical growth and development (physical and oral health, body image, healthy eating, physical activity) Social and academic competence (connectedness with family, peers, and community; interpersonal relationships; school performance) Emotional wellbeing (coping, mood regulation and mental health, sexuality) Risk reduction (tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs; pregnancy; STIs) Violence and injury preven tion (safety belt and helmet use, substance abuse and riding in a vehicle, guns, interpersonal violence [fights], bullying). 1 Coverage of Preventive Health Services (26 CFR 54.9815-2713T, 29 CFR 2590.715-2713, 45 CFR 147.130) accessed from www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/Regulations andGuidance/index.html#Prevention 2 October 1, 2015 Prioritized List of Health Services.

Accessed from www.oregon.gov/oha/herc/Pages/PrioritizedList.aspx and tools/guidelines andpocket guide/Pages/default.aspx 3Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 While it is likely not feasible to address every priority within one well care visit, Bright Futures recommends prioritizing the issues most pertinent to each patient, and have the goal of addressing the issues over multiple well care visits. Nationally, 43 percent of adolescents 1221 on Medicaid received a well visit in the past year, representing the population with the lowest utilization of primary care compared to any other age group.6 Oregon ranks in the bottom 25 percent of states that track this measure, with 32 percent of enrollees aged 1221 receiving a wellcare th Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Why are annual well visits important for adolescents? Adolescence is one of the most dynamic periods of development, second only to infancy. A key developmental task of adolescence is transitioning to increased independence from parents and guardians. While most adolescents enjoy good health dramatic physical, cognitive, social, and emotional change during this period calls for a unique approach to health care compared to adults or young childre n. The l eading causes of death among adolescents (unintentional injury, homicide and suicide) are largely preventable. During this period of development, youth begin to make their own decisions regarding relationships, lifestyle and health behaviors. Data from Oregon Healthy Teens Survey, a statewide health survey among 8th and 11th graders, indicates that some youth engage in behaviors that could put their immediate and long term health in jeopardy [see Box 1].8 Health behaviors established in adolescence tend to persist into adulthood, and many chronic diseases first emerge in this age. Half of all lifetime cases of mental health diagnoses first begin by age 14.9 Youth who begi n drinking at age 14 or younger are 45 times more likely to develop substance abuse over their lifetime compared to someone who started drinking at 19.10 Youth who are overweight or obese ten d to become overweight and obese adults.11 Further, high school graduation - a strong predictor of lifelong health and economic stability\u2014 is a touchstone of this developmental period, launching adolescents into postsecondary education, military 8 2015 Oregon Healthy Teens Survey Available: http://public.health.oregon.gov/Bir thDeathCertificates/Surveys/OregonHealthyTeens/Pages/index.aspx 9 National Institute of Mental Health Release of landmark and collaborative study conducted by Harvard University, the University of Michigan and NIHM Intramural research Program.

Health and learning go hand in hand. Students who are physically and emotionally well are better learners.12 Annual, comprehensive wellvisits aligned to Bright Futures are a strong vehicle to deliver screening, anticipatory guidance, and health education to support healthy development now, and in the future. It is an important opportunity to identify health conditions that commonly arise in this period early, such as mental health diagnoses and substa nce use issues. Additionally, annual well visits provide a trainin g ground for youth to learn to navigate the health care system, and transition to independent and savvy consumers of health care services in adulthood. The process of supporting youth to transition from pediatric to adult care is an area of national focus. The national i nitiative Got Transition has identified six core elements of health care transition: Transition policy: statement that describes the practice's approach to transition Transition tracking and monitoring: criteria to identify transitioning youth and process to track transition progress Transition readiness: conducting regular transition readiness assessments Transition planning: creati ng a plan of care related to transition Transfer of care: confirm first appointment with adult provider and complete transfer packet Transfer completion: follow up with young person/family 36 months posttransition and remain as consultant to adult care provider. More details and sample transit ion policies, readiness assessments and ins tructions can be found at www.gottransition.org. 12 Bradley BJ, Greene AC. (2013).

A number of challenges to improvement were identified through consultation with quality improvement specialists, state experts, and a review of the existing literature, including: Creating a culture shif t among health plans, providers, parents and youth to value and prioritize annual well care visits for adolescents. Ensuring care is youthcentered, developmentally appropriate, and culturally competent. Missed opportunities to provide well care visits when adolescents present for care. Youth hesitancy to access care because of confidenti ality conc erns. Optimizing clinic workflows and panel management techniques. Changes in recommendations for clinical care for adolescents. Health plan limits on the number of adolescent well care visits in a calendar year. Ensuring school based health centers (SBHCs) are fully leveraged, and care is coordinated betw een SBHC and community providers. In the next section, each challenge is expanded upon, and possible opportunities for improvement and links to tools and resources are provided. Where applicable, a story from the field provides an onthe ground example of how communities are addressing adolescent well care. The following list is not exhau s tive, and the degrees to which these challenges impact the delivery of adolescent well care will vary across communities. Additionally, many challenges are connected to one another, and some opportunities for improvement can address multiple challenges. 7Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Challenge: Creating a culture shift among health plans, providers, parents and youth to value and prioritize annual well care visits for adolescents. Ensuring care is youthcentered and culturally relevant. Culture and attitudes towards adolescent well care visits underpin many of the challenges highlighted in this document, but also represents an independent barrier that will require strategies at the health plan, provider, youth and family levels. Prior to implementation of the ACA provision that annual well care visits for adolescents must be paid without costsharing, many health plans may have only reimbursed for a well care visit every two years. Although payment policies have shifted, it takes time for communication, guidance and practice policies to change as well. For providers, it was standard practice to only see adolescents every two years. Some providers may not be aware that annual well care visits for adolescents are reimbursable, and it takes time to adjust clinic practice, scheduling, and messaging to youth and families. Thus, youth and families may not be aware of the importance of the well visit, what is contained within a well visit, how it differs from a sports physical, and that they should come in every year. An important facet of shifting the culture of care for the adolescent population is providing care that is youthcentered, developmentally appropriate, and culturally relevant. Providing care for adolescents requires considerations that are different compared to young children and older adul ts. Eight domains have been identified as central to young people's experience of care and include: Accessibility of health care: location and affordability Staff attitude: accurate knowledge, respectful and supportive, honest, trustworthy and friendly Communication: provider's listening skills was most often identified as aspect that made visit \"good\". Direct communica tion without a lecturing tone of voice. Medical competency: technical skills (i.e. injection techniques) Guideline driven care: issues of confidentiality, autonomy, and transition to adult health care were most important to young people. Age appropriate environments: flexibility in scheduling appointments, separate physical space with teenoriented leafle ts, health infor m ation and a television and games. Youth involvement in health care: young people wanted to be involved with their health care and was directly associated with having a good understanding of their medical condition and treatment. Health outcomes: pain management was an important outcome in chronic care settings, outcomes such as mental health improvement and pregnancy prevention were identified as additional priorities. 13 13 Ambresin AE, Bennett K, Patton GC, Sanci LA, Sawyer SM.

Measure youth's experience of care. Consider using an adolescent completed survey tool such as the Young Adult Health Care Survey (YAHCS) or other assessment. Include youth on governance and advisory councils, or create a youth advisory council. Youth are the best source of information regarding their needs. Including youth on boards and advisory councils provides decisionmakers a direct link to the population intended to be served and young people with an opportunity to learn new skills and ex posure to careers in the health care field.14 Increase training and practice improvement support for adolescent providers (including pediatric, family medicine, community clinics) to provide adolescent well care visits aligned to Bright Futures.

Spotlight: Yamhill CCO's Student Wellness and Game (SWAG) Night Clinics in Yamhill County and Yamhill CCO are trying to make preventative care the norm, starting with what they call a Student Wellness and Games (SWAG) night. SWAG Night is intended to bring in teens for check ups and establish a rapport with their clinic health care team. The program involved extending clinic hou rs in six Yamhill County clinics and only performing adolescent wellcare checks during those extended hours. The events were designed to be engaging and communal. Yamhill CCO provided funds for food, video games, and a raffle for patients to enjoy together wh ile they waited for appointments. The program was marketed to teens and parents, especially CCO members and patients who were not engaged with their primary care clinics. Clinics saw a combined 137 patients in one night, which pushed them closer to their AWC metric goals. According to initial survey data, 10 percent of the tee ns in attendance would not have gotten an AWC without SWAG night, and 42 percent of teens reported not getting an AWC or only receiving a sports physical the previous year.

Missed opportunities occur when youth access primary care for a service other than a well visit. Providers may perform and bill for acute care visits or sports physical exams when the youth could benefit from a comprehensive well care visit. Opportunities CCO/Health System Consider adjusting policy that directs providers to conduct well vis its instead of sports physical exams. Clarify billing mechanisms that support providers to offer a well visit during a visit for a chronic or acute condition. Message policy/practice standard to provider network. These could range from formal clinic policies to clinical practice standards or contractual language. Message policy/practi c e standard to youth and families. Consider multiple modes of communication, including use of member website/portal, mailing, text, member service staff. Providers/Clinics Have a clinic policy to conduct well care visits in place of sports physical. Display clinic policy for patients and families and help them understand the difference. Optimize heal th information technology systems to enable providers to quickly identify whether the youth is due for a well visit when they schedule an acute care visit. Develop frontoffice procedures that trigger automatic reviews to see if youth is due for a well visit when they call to schedule an acute care visit.Spotlight: Mosaic Medical's move to comprehensive well care visits instead of sports physicals Mosaic Medial is committed to providing exceptional care to each and every patient. The standard of care within Mosaic clinics is to provide comprehensive child/adolescent well checks as opposed to abbreviated sports physical exams. Making this shift requires revamping clinic workflows and messaging to parents and youth who just want a quick sports physical. See Appendix B for full story. 12Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Challenge: Youth hesitancy to access care because of confidentiality concerns. Youth are less likely to seek needed health care or disclose risky health behaviors if they do not believe the information will be kept confidential.16,17 Minors and other dependents may not seek care for reproductive health, STI/STD testing and treatment, behavioral health concerns, or domestic violence due to their sensitive nature or fear of stigma, physical endangerment, or trauma. Sensitive health information may be inadvertently disclosed through billing communication (i.e. an explanation of benefits), clinic workflows (i.e. appoin tment reminders), and electronic health information exchanges (i.e. online patient portals). Ensuring adolescents' private information is not inadvertently disclosed to a parent or guardian involves a complex web of federal, state and clinic policies. Given the complexity of the issue, no single solution will fully address the problem. However, as ACA imple men tation and statelevel health care transformation efforts continue to cover more Oregonians, increase coordination of care and accountability, and expand the utilization of electronic health records, the need for strategies to ensure privacy and confidentiality will continue. Opportunities CCO/Health System Ensure necessary staff are familiar with Oregon's Minor Consent laws. To the extent possible, limit the communications (such as explanation of benefits, or EOBs) mailed to adolescent member's homes. Work with your Privacy Officer or legal staff to understand the instances in which communications must be sent, and direct those communications to the adolescent when possible. Allow members to submit a confidential communications request that would redirect any communications directly to the adolescent. Recent legislation in Oregon (HB 2758, 2015 Session) requires all commercial health plans to honor confidential communications requests.

Ensure this i nformation is easily accessible to providers and youth. To the extent possible, establish policies to standardize functionality within health information technology (HIT) and electronic health record (EHR) systems to protect privacy, such as: privacy default settings for youth who can selfconsent to care; pointofservice privacy controls for providers (i.e. ability to fla g history, problem list, labs or prescriptions as confidential); builtin privacy related decision support tools; adjustable proxy access for patient portals; and clear guidance on which ages are allowed sole access to their patient portal.18 Provide clear policy guidance to provider network regarding what information is sent to the youth's home (such as billing information). To the extent possible, provide clear guidance and training on any functionality within the HIE/EHR system to protect privacy. Provide additional training and practice improvement support to providers regarding best practices in adolescent well care related to maintaining privacy (i.e. crafting standard policies, workflows, billing practices and optimizing HIE/EHR systems). Providers/Clinics Ensure all clinic staff are familiar with Oregon's Minor Consent laws. Map the patient's entire experience of care (from appointment setting to billing) and identify privacy \"gaps \" where a youth's sensitiv e information could be inadvertently disclosed. Ask adolescent patients how they would like to be contacted regarding their care. To the extent possible, know whether contracted health plans send EOBs, and for what services. If you serve both private and public patients, ensure providers and clinic st aff are familiar with the process for requesting confidential communication per HB 2758.

Clearly communicate clinic policies to youth and families, within the context of the importance of adolescent well care, and planning to transition to adult health care. Clearly display confidentiality policy in waiti ng room and visit rooms. Ensure all clinic staff are trained on workflows to protect confidential information, including any functionality within the EHR to flag information as confidential.Sample handouts for youth and parents/guardians can be found on the Oregon SBHC webpage. 15Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Challenge: Optimizing clinic workflow and panel management techniques. Delivering care to adolescents requires workflow considerations that differ from younger children or adults. Many clinics do not have standardized workflows that take into account time needed for private time with a provider, how sensitive screening questions are asked, or necessary referrals and confidential coding, billing and care coordination. Further, some providers may not have the infrastructur e or capacity to identify and provide targeted outreach to youth who are due for well visits. Opportunities CCO/Health System Provide financial incentives to providers for performance improvement to offset additional clinic staff time needed to conduct outreach to adolescent patients. Provide financial incentives for youth to come in for a well care visit. Ensure that the incentives are meaningful to the youth and financially sustainable to provide. Provide updated, easytouse utilization reports to enable providers to identify and prioritize who needs a well visit. Ensure contact information for youth and families is accurat e. Providers/Cli nics Identify barriers that youth may be experiencing in getting care (i.e. lack of transportation, clinic hours that don't align with schedule). Consider adding dropin hours where youth can come without an appointment. Adopt flexible administrative and appointment booking procedures for youth. Consider adding evening and/ or weekend clinic hours, or dropin appointments. Include youth in quality improvement teams. Solicit feedback on best methods to reach youth in the community (i.e. social media, youthserving organizations, community health workers). Resources CareOregon METRO developed an Adolescent Well Check (including SBIRT and Depression Screeni ng) H andbook. It provides a checklist of readiness questions for clinics to consider when conducting adolescent well care visits, and recommends a number of tools and resources to aid in readiness. See Appendix D for full handbook. Sample Adolescent Well Care workflows from Multnomah County FQHC can be found in Appen dix E.Spotlight: Member and provider incentive programs across the state Several CCOs and health systems have deployed member and/or provider incentive programs as one way to increase adolescent well care visits in their regions. See Appendix C for highlights and lessons learned from several incentive programs in CCOs across the state. 16Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 Challenge: Changes in recommendations for clinical care for adolescents. Recommendations for adolescent care have changed in the last 510 years. For example, a PAP smear is no longer recommended for most women before the age of 21, and providers may be less likely to perform well visits without the \"draw\" of a completed PAP smear. Further, providers and families may not be aware of the current recommendati ons for adolescent immunizations or screenings (such as substance use and depression screening) that could help promote annual well care visits. Opportunities CCO/Health System Provide messaging to provider network, youth and families that outlines the important components of annual, highquality well care as described in Bright Futures. Increase train ing and pra ctice improvement support for adolescent providers regarding recommended screening and guidance as outlined in Bright Futures. Bundle improvement strategies that address other CCO incentive measures and are included within a Bright Futures aligned well care visit. For example, screening for alcohol and substance use (SBIRT), depression screening, tobacco use, and effective contr aception use. Providers/Clinics Bundle improvement strategies that address other CCO incentive measures and are included within a Bright Futures aligned well care visit. For example, screening for alcohol and substance use (SBIRT), depression screening, tobacco use, and effective contraception use. Become familiar with Bright Futures Guidelines and ACIP immunization recommendations for adolescents. Participate in continuing education opportunities focused on best practices in clinical care for adolescents, such as substance use and depression screening. Resources Bright Futures provides a number of resources for providers to support implementation of compreh ensi ve adolescent well care, including archived webinars: https://brightfutures.aap.org/materials andtools/tooland resource kit/Pages/default.aspx 17Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 Spotlight: Training for primary care providers: Increasing depression and substance use screening (SBIRT) in adolescent well care visits The Oregon Pediatric Society's Screening Tools and Referral Training (START) Program has developed a one day training focused on: Implementing standardized screening for depression and substance use; Understanding and case management of youth experiencing depression and/or substance abuse; Delivery of office based interventions; Creating connections with local community resources; Considerations related to patient confidentiality and consent. The training was developed as a part of the Adolescent Health Project, a collaboration between the Oregon Pediatric Society, the Oregon Health Authority, and the Oregon Pediatric Improvement Partnership. Two hour trainings are also available on individual topics: the Adolescent Well Visit; Adolescent Depression Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment & Referral; and SBIRT and Adolescents.

Some health plans may have limits on the number of adolescent well visits allowed/reimbursed for within a calendar year, which may not match utilization patterns of adolescents, and limits flexibility to receive well visits from access points most convenient for adolescents. Opportunities CCO/Health System Remove any limits on the number of adolescent well visits that can be cond ucted and reimbursed within a cale ndar year or 12 month time frame. Regularly communicate policy to provider network. Optimize health information sharing technology to allow provider network to quickly identify whether a youth has received a well visit, and where. Providers/Clinics Know the policies of contr a cted health plans regarding the number of well visits that can occur within a given time period. 19Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 Challenge: Ensuring schoolbased health centers are fully leveraged, and care is coordinated between schoolbased health centers and community providers Schoolbased health centers (SBHCs) provide convenient, youthcentered access to primary care where many youth spend a majority of their day\u2014in school. In the 201415 school year, 73,425 visits were delivered to 22,505 youth (ages 521) in Oregon's 75 SBHCs, representing an excellent opportunity to reach adolescents where they are. Appr oximately 53 perce nt of th ose youth are enrolled in Medicaid. However, there are challenges specific to SBHCs. Some communities and individuals have the perception that SBHCs only offer acute or specialty care. In reality, the SBHC Standards for Certification require SBHCs to offer an array of primary care services similar to any other primary care site. Fortynine percent of SBHCs are recognize d as PatientCentered Primary Care Homes. Adolescents have the benefit of easily accessible, youthfocused care through an SBHC, but SBHCs and community providers have the challenge of ensuring care coordination when SBHCs are not the assigned primary care provider (PCP). Over coming the following challenges may help communities better utilize SBHCs to provide adolescent well care visits: limits on the number well care visits that can be completed in a year; payment for well care visits being tied to PCP designation; and health information technology systems that limit care coordination and communi cati on between SBHC and community providers. 19 Opportunities CCO/Health System Remove any limits on the number of adolescent well visits that can be conducted and reimbursed within a calendar year or 12 month time frame. Decouple payment for the adolescent well care visit from PCP designation. Ensure SBHCs can be fully reimbursed for well care visits provided, regardless of youth's assigned PCP. Optimize heal th information technology systems to support care coordination among SBHC and community providers. For example, provide systems for SBHC providers to easily identify a youth's PCP, identify whether a youth has received a 19 Transforming care based health centers: Innovation Grants The Oregon SBHC State Program Office was allocated onetime funding from the 2013 Legislature to support improved coordination of care between SBHCs and CCOs and improving the effectiveness and quality of health services delivered through SBHCs. Several grantees focused on increasing adolescent well care visits and employed a nu mber of strategies in partnership with their CCO. See Appendix F for more details. 20Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 well visit in the past year, and a method for SBHC and community providers to confidentially share visit information with each other (e.g. through the functionality of CareAccord). Providers/Clinics Maintain clear policies on how information and care is coordinated between SBHC providers and the youth's primary care provi der (if not the SBHC). Resources SBHC Program Website: www.healthoregon.org/sbhc Conclusion Adolescent well care visits present an excellent opportunity for primary care providers to deliver critical screening, anticipatory guidance and health education to young people as they begin to transition to adulthood and adult utilization of health care. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act and health system transformation in Oregon has elevated the impo rtance of adolescent well care, though improvements in the area do not come without challenges to overcome. The challenges and improvement opportunities listed here are not exhaustive, and new challenges and obstacles are anticipated as work in this area continues. This document will be updated regularly with emerging evidence, best practice, and innovati ve strategies from communities working to improve adolescent well care, and the health of their adolescent population, in the future.

An overview of the CCO incentive measure specifications and known coding challenges are described below. Measure Specifications OHA is following HEDIS specifications for the CCO incentive measure. Current specifications are posted online at: http://www.oregon.gov/oha/analytics/Pages/CCOBaselineData.aspx and this section describes both the CY 2015 and 2016 measurement. Denominator: CCO members ages 1221 years old as of December 31st of the measurement year. Members must be continuously enrolled in the CCO for the measurement year, with no more than one gap in enrollment of up to 45 days. Numerator: Members ages 1221 years old receiving at least one comprehensive well care visit during the measurement year. Well care visits are identified using the codes below. Exclusions: N/A Coding These codes do not have to be used in combination. Use of any of these codes can be used to identify an adolescent well care visit for the numerator. Note OHA does not limit the well care visit measure to those visits provided by PCPs or Set also includes codes that only apply to infants. These codes are not included in the Adolescent Well Care measure and are not listed here. *These codes do not have to be the pri mary diagnosis. **Note: Z00.8 and Z02.xx ICD10 codes are not covered under OHP administrative rules or on the prioritized list as of 10/1/2015, however this measure does include denied claims. 22Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Coding for Adolescent Well Care and Prenatal Care Visits If a provider sees a pregnant adolescent for prenatal care, and the prenatal care services provided also meet criteria for an adolescent well care visit (see above), it is possible to code for both the prenatal care using global OB codes and the adolescent well care visit as long as the medical record inc lude documentations of services to support billing for both an adolescent well care visit and prenatal care for the date(s) of service billed. There are no known correct coding initiatives that would prevent billing global OB services and adolescent well care visits together for Medicaid members; it is also possible to use the diagnosis codes in the We llCare Value Set above as a secondary diagnosis for a comprehensive well visit along with the global OB codes. It is the responsibility of each provider to select the most appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes when billing for services. It is the provid ers' responsibility to co mply with the CCO or contracted health plan's prior authorization requirements or other policies necessary for reimbursement, before providing services to any Medicaid or other health plan member. It is the providers' responsibility to be compliant with state and federal laws (see OAR 4101201160). 23Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Appendix A: Engaging Teens for Adolescent Well Care Checks Yamhill CCO Improvement opportunities covered in this section include: gathering youth information (survey), extended clinic hours, including youth in planning process, outreach to families, and incentives. Student Wellness and Games (SWAG) Night Clinics in Yamhill County and Yamhill CCO are trying to make preventative care the norm, starting with what they call a Student Wellness and Games (SWAG) night. SWAG Night is intended to bring in teens for checkups and establish a rapport with their clinic health care team. The teenage years are a prime time to develop positive relationship with a primary care provider, identify potentially risky behaviors, and encourage healthy behavior through a teen's lifespan. The program involved extending clinic hours in six Yamhill County clinics and only performing adolescent wellcare checks during those extended hours. The events were designed to be engaging and comm unal. Yamhill CCO provided funds for food, video games, and a raffle for patients to enjoy together while they waited for appointments. The program was marketed to teens and parents, especially CCO members and patients who were not engaged with their primary care clinics. Workflow Small clinic workflow: For smaller clinics, the event did not differ much in workflow from regular exams. Food and games were offered during waiting times, with prizes available after the exam had been completed. Maintaining a quieter environment was especially important in one clinic that had longer hours, and was still operating as usual . Large clinic wo rkflow: The clinic with the busiest turnout planned for a large influx of patients, and planned the intake procedure accordingly. Numbered stations were designated for preliminary paperwork, vitals, vaccinations, vision screenings, and the actual exam. Patients entered and were given their paperwork, which included health history and a general wellness questio nnaire, as well as a feedback survey and a ticket listing all of the stations. A staff member or clinician would initial the station number as the patient completed each step. If, during the exam, the patient noted any behavioral health problems, a behaviorist was on call in the clinic to meet with the adolescent immed iately. Patients and families were milling around in the waiting room, eating pizza and playing video games. There was also a raffle, and prizewinners were announced every half hour or so. Once patients had completed their exams, they turned in their paperwork and received a bag of \"swag\" from various local businesses and par tners. One of the risks of mass wellcare events is shuffling patients through more quickly than usual, meaning they may miss out on the full preventative care exam. This was addressed in planning meetings, and while the vitals stations were assembly line style in th e clinic with the largest patient load, exams were not abbreviated unless the patient had multiple issues or complex concerns; in that case a followup appointment was recommended and scheduled. 24Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Attendance The CCO's support consisted of providing funds for food and prizes during the event, sending postcards to members, and some staff support. In terms of investment, this was great success. Clinics saw a combined 137 patients in one night, wh ich pushed them closer to their AWC metric goals. According to initial survey data, 10 percent of the teens in attendance would not have gotten an AWC without SWAG night, and 42 percent of teens reported not getting an AWC or only receiving a sports physical the previous year. Steps to a Successful Event The clinic tha t developed the SWAG night had noteworthy success. This clinic saw 96 teens, over half of which were CCO members. This clinic also administered over 100 vaccines, including 54 HPV vaccines. Interestingly, 40 of those were to teen boys, which may be indicative of these vaccines being more widely accepted as appropriate for males. This clinic did a number of things that contributed to its event's success, including: Gathering a group of teens for a focus group to inform the work using a convenience sample of staff members' children and friends. Organizations must find adolescents wher e they are at and utilize any input they can. Teens gave input on what would motivate them to attend appointments, and the resulting event included pizza, video games, and a social atmosphere. Connecting with local businesses and partners to gain \"swag\" for the event. This bags, water bottles, stres s balls, and other sundries for the teens to take home after their appointment. This partnership also included advertising the event at local businesses, especially those where local teens spend time. Marketing aggressively and early is one of the reasons the event had such a positive turnout. Enthusiastic and supportiv e clinic staff. There was a great deal of excitement around it and staff reported wanted to do it again and enjoying it. These events are about changing culture of well care and improving clinic patient relations, and the creation of a fun, relaxed environment for teens really seemed to encourage clinic attenda nce. Marketing Strategies Clinics all called their patients, especially CCO patients who had been assigned to them but not yet made contact. This had varying success, but part of future goals will be to connect more robustly with unengaged patients and establish relationships with primary care providers early. Adolescent CCO members who were du e for an appointment also received postcards telling them about the SWAG night opportunity. 25Oregon He alth Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 Other methods of marketing included a short article in the local paper, flyers, and business cards with SWAG night info handed out at a local community event. A hashtag, #TeenSWAGNight, was created, and tshirts for the staff were made. Surveys reported most patients learned of SWAG nig ht from their parents, but the postcards and word ofmouth were the other items called out specifically. Reports from the event organizers frequently included recommendations to start marketing even earlier and try multiple times to engage patients and get them in for appointm en ts. While the most effective marketing item can't necessarily be determined, depth and breadth of advertisement seems to be a requirement for a successful event. Data Collection Surveys were created for both teens and parents. While the surveys asked about SWAG night in general, they also gathered information about barriers to receiving regular well care. The question \"If anything, what makes it harder to get your child(ren) in for wellvisits?\" Seventeen percent of the parents who responded thought that a sports physical or a physical every two years was enough. Much of the work around increasing adolescent wellvisits will be educati n g parents on the importance of regular preventative care for their children. A fifth of the teens responding to the same question said they do not need to go to the clinic when they are not sick, or that a sports physical is enough. Also of note, 4 of the 67 teens note d they do not go to appointme nts because they are worried they might find out something is wrong. Clinics are often associated with being ill, and the hope is that large events like this might further normalize preventative care and remove some of the anxiety from appointments. Suggestions for Impro vement Marketing mu st happen well in advance and clear communication between all the key partners is required for the event's success. For other communities taking on events like this, and for our own future events, a representative from every participating clinic should attend at least one planning meeting and agree on clear objectives. However, each cli nic will need to determine on its own the most effective way to boost wellvisits according to their own population. In some situations, a mass exam event does not suit the needs of their patients as well as some other alternatives or incentives might.

The standard of care within Mosaic clinics is to provide comprehensive child/adolescent well checks as opposed to abbreviated sports physical exams. Making this shift has required revamping of clinic workflows and messaging to parents and youth who just want a quick sports physical. To support this shift, sample language for families and clinic workflows are provided. See below for examples. Sample Dialogue to Share with Patients and Parents Mosaic Medical is committed to providing exceptional care to each and every patient we see. We perform Well Child or Adolescent checks and we will comple te sports p articipation forms according to national, state and local standards of pediatric care. A limited, \"sports exam\" is not done at Mosaic or any other pediatric practice following the guidelines for regular child health care. This comprehensive exam includes assessment and treatment of any ongoing health problems; assessment and guid ance about growth, weight, nutrition, vision; review of their school progress; screening, intervention and guidance for behavioral or mental health problems including substance use, sleep problems, and depression; regular immunizations; and screening tests for anemia, iron deficiency, lead poisoning, high cholesterol, and sexually transmitted infections when appropriate. These are the standard for all children's health care at regular intervals, performed more frequently for infants and yearly for children, adolescents and young adults ages 2 to 21. Sample Workflow for Scheduling a Well Care Visit in Place of Sports Physical From Crook Kids Clinic Parent says \"Hi, my kid needs a sports physical\" Look at the appointment history. oIf well child check (WCC) was completed within the last 12 months, clinic can fill out the form without an appt. Open an encounter and put a form in her folder. Let the parent\"We have an obligation to perform the best, most competent care of our patients. At times, this may frustrate some patients. Providing a limited service opposes the core beliefs and standards to which our medical providers adhere. Doing a more comprehensive assessment that includes screening for depression, suicidality, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and risk for pregnancy upholds our clinical standards while also better supporting the patient and serving the whole community.\" Dr. Darin Vaughan, Director of Pedi atrics 27Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 know they will receive a call when the form is ready for pick up. oIf no WCC was completed within the last 12 months, make appointment for WCC and sports physical. At this point, staff will explain that that sports physical is a limited exam which does not address key aspects of the patient's overall health, and that many parents are unaware that the limited sports physical exam does not take the place of a comprehensive well check each year. Staff will also explain that they now roll the limited spor ts physical exam into the comprehensive well check exam that is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The well check exam includes a complete physical exam, eye exam, age appropriate health review, vaccine review and recommendations, among other things. Staff will explain that an added bonus is that most insurance will cover 100 percent of a well check visit once every 12 months with the sports physical included, and if the patient were to complete just the sports physical appointment alone, it would cost $20. When included in the well check, the family pays nothing out of pocket and the patient has received the compreh ensi ve exam that is beneficial for their health. This approach has been shown effective to help Crook Kids Clinic to educate parents about the value of Well Checks, and still perform the added service of the sports physical. 28Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 Appendix C: Providing Incentives to Providers and Patients Adolescent Well Care SchoolBased Health Center Incentive Pilot: Central Oregon Health Council and PacificSource Community Solutions CCO Certified School Based Health Centers (SBHCs) in PacificSource Commu nity Solutions (PSCS) service area (Deschutes, C rook, Jefferson and northern Klamath counties) were able to make requests to the Central Oregon Health Council (COHC) for a onetime award of $10,000 to use to support patient (student) incentives. Funding could be used to supp ort incentives and ince ntiverelated costs. The SBHC incentive pilot project ran from January 2015 through the end of the school year. Six area SBHCs participated in the pilot project. All of the SBHCs used gift cards as an incentive to youth and families, though they varied by amount and type. The average amount was $25 and some gift card s were for entertainment, sporting goods, and dining, while another SBHC chose a local grocery store. Findings Feedback from youth and parents were positive. Families typically scheduled a well care visit after coming into the SBHC for an acute need. This facetoface interaction was found to be the most successful meth od in getting people to schedule a well care visit. Parents were pleasantly surprised about the incentive program. One clinic reported that some parents became emotional upon learning they would receive a gift card to help with groceries. Overall, providers found the pilot project to be successful, even under such a short impl ementation timeline. Many reported that the incentive program had a positive impact on getting adolescents in who were either due or well overdue for a well care visit, and that it helped lift the importance of preventive care. One clinic found that as a result of the pilot, they had a 56% in crease in the number of well care visits compared to the previous school year. Lessons Learned The short timeframe of the project was a challenge. Running the incentive program for the entire school year would offer more time for advertising and outreach. Need for more targeted outreach strategies. For example, providing followup phone calls to adolescents who are due for a well care visit, and conducting awareness building campaigns within the school. One SBHC did make announcements at school assemblies and over the school radio, but another opportunity may be to partner with health teachers to present in health classes, and align a presentation on the well care visit with the health class standards and benchmarks around accessing services.

La Clinica operates seven SBHCs and RCH operates four SBHCs in Jackson County. In partnership with JCC, La Clinica and RCH provided an incentive to adolescents to receive a well care visit at their primary care clinics, including SBHCs. Participants were eligible to receive a $10 iTunes gift card. The incentive period lasted from 9/1/2014 to 12/31/2014. Jackson Care Connect generated a list of all members eligible for a well care visit, which was then shared with La Clinica and RCH. Both entities worked to reac h out to eligible patients through phone calls and direct mail. Jackson Care Connect and its schoolbased health center partners did not find this strategy alone to be effective. Several challenges identified were: Provider capacity to meet the increased demand for services, even with expande d primary care hours. Parent/provider lack of familiarity with the relatively new recommendation to provide well care visits annually. Some patient demographic information was not accurate or current, which hampered outreach efforts. Parents/clients often did not return phone calls, even if the contact information provided was uptodate. For children who could not selfconsent to health services, finding time for working parents to bring them in for an appointment. 30Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 Providing Incentives to Members for Adolescent Well Care Visits: CareOregon within Columbia Pacific CCO CareOregon within Columbia Pacific CCO (CPCCO) began providing incentives to adolescent memb ers for getting an annual adolescent well care visit in October 2014. For those clinics that agreed to participate in the process, Columbia Pacific mailed letters to adolescent members that were due for a well care visit to notify them that they were due for a visit and would receive a $10 gift card from Subway, Amazon or iTunes. CPCCO provided a list to the clinics of the individual members to whom letters were sent, and clinics were encouraged to conduct additional followup with families. The gift cards were purchased, manage d, and sent to memb ers by CareOregon staff. Upon completion of the well care visit, adolescent members filled out a form in the clinic in order to receive the gift card. The form was sent via fax or scanned and securely emailed to CareOregon and the gift card was then sent out by CareOregon. Additionally, clinics that served large populations of adolescent members were asked to hold Saturday or extended hour evening clinics. Many of the Saturday clinics were staffed by 14 providers over a half or full day. In 2015, CPCCO added an additional incentive to providers willing to add the CRAF FT screening and billing process to the adolescent well care visit workflow. Care Oregon provided funding for food for the providers, adolescents and families that came in during the Saturday clinics. This helped create a warm and welcoming community environment. Saturday clinics were held toward the end of the year, and proved very successful. One clinic completed close to 60 well care visits during the Saturday clinic days. Key Learnings Providing gift cards to adolescent members is an important part of changing the culture of care and getting both youth and families used to the idea of coming in for an annual well care visit. Purchasing an d managing the gift cards was sometimes challenging. Providing choice is important, but ensuring there were enough gift cards available, without purchasing too many in advance, was difficult. One recommendation may be to go with one gift card choice, but increase the value of the gift card. Clinics that followed up, via a proactive phone call, with families that received the initial letter from CareOregon were much more successful at getting the adolescent in for the visit.

In an effort to engage its adolescent members around their health, FamilyCare Health has an incentive program for adolescents to connect with their medical team. This program includes supportive materials that are distributed to FamilyCare Health community partners and directly to its members. See below for sample materials. 32Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidanc e Document - November 2015 33Adolescent Well Check, Including SBIRT and Depression Screening HANDBOOK: Clinic Readiness Checklist Consider the following questions in assessing your clinic's readiness for conducting Adolescent Well Check (AWC) Visits for 12-21yos. *Recommended tools/resources follow those questions where we have identified tools or online resources that will assist you in improving your readiness. STATUS PREPARATION Assessment: Before all else: Addressing Consent and Confidentiality for Adolescent Patients oIs your clinic leadership and staff aware of age limits and limitations of consent and confidentiality as described in federal and state laws? * oDoes your clinic have a standard process for transitioning patients from being accompanied pediatric patients to semi -autonomous patients (ie, a timeline for when conversations occur with patients and parents/caregivers re: confidentiality, autonomy in the exam room and consent to treatment?) * Front Office/Schedulers oIs your scheduling staff aware to book all requests for \"Sports Physicals\" as AWCs? oDo the schedulers know that CareOregon will pay for more than one AWC in a year? oDo the schedulers know that CareOregon is giving out $10 gift cards to adolescents (CareOregon Members ) to incentivize their participation in an AWC (assuming the visit is completed and the incentive form is faxed to CareOregon)? Access/Supplies oWhat is your access currently at the clinic and what measure s are you taking to prepare for increased demand if outreach to adolescents is successful (ie dedicated AWC clinics or extended summer hours to get adolescents in )? oDo you have enough vaccines on hand for those who will want them (TDAP, HPV, Mening ococcus )? Outreach /Scrubbing oDo you have dedicated staff to do outreach for this activity ? oHow will you run reports on 12-21yos needing an AWC in this calendar year ? oDo you have your member list from CareOregon? oWhat will the standard workflow be for outreach? oHow will you account for those who have had a visit recently but did not get an AWC? oHow will you account for the majority of adolescents who had their AWC at the end of 2014 (ie, spreading out the demand in the next 6 months to avoid bolus at the end of the year )? oIs a pre -visit scrub standardized and implemented such that ALL adolescent visits may be prepped to be completed as an AW C, regardless of presenting complaint, including prenatal visits? *Appendix D: Adolescent Well Check Handbook from CareOregon METRO Oregon Health Authority Adolescent Well Care Visits Guidance Document - November 2015 34In the Waiting Room oAre documents on hand in the clinic to provide patients and parents/caregivers re: explanations of privacy and confidentiality? * oWill you administer a previsit screening questionnaire that include s, among other questions, the SBIRT brief screen (ie CR AFFT for 12-17yo, Annual 2-question Screen for 18+) and PHQ -2 depression screen? * oHow will you ensure the patien t has adequate confidentiality to respond freely and honestly to the questions and any surveys or screenings ? * MA & Provider Comfort/Skills and Visit Documentation oDo your MAs feel competent and comfortable rooming adolescents? Is there a process for the MA to know whether to invite parent/caregiver to come back to the exam room from the start of the visit vs. inviting the parent/caregiver to wait in the waiting roo m? oDo all providers feel competent in performing the activities of an AWC? * oDoes your organization have an easily accessible template in the EHR (or on paper) to be able to conduct and document a risk/sstrengths based screening and developmental history (ie, the HEADDSSS assessment)? * oDoes the template include the validated SBIRT and Depression screening tools that will count towards your performance on the CCO metrics in these areas? * oDo all providers feel com petent/comfortable administering an SBIRT to an adolescent (ie, CRAFFT to 12 -17yos as different from the Annual 2 -question Screen for 18+) * oDo you have a process in place for capturing PHQ -9 scores in your EHR? Recall that the PHQ -9 \"counts\" as follow -up for a positive depression screen and the metric is solely counted based on documentation of the PHQ -9 score in the EHR. It is NOT a claims -based metric. CareOregon $10 Gift Care Incentive for completion of the AWC oDo you have a master copy of the CareOregon $10 Gift Card incentive form in your clinic? * oIs there a workflow in place for ensuring that the CareOregon $10 Gift Card incentive forms are available at the beginning of the visit and that the MA or provider is aware to prompt the patient to complete the form prior to leaving the building? oIs there a workflow in place for ensuring that completed form is faxed to CareOregon so that the gift care may be sent to the patient? Billing/Coding oAre your providers and/or billing/coding staff aware of what is required in the documentation for an AWC? * oAre your providers and/or billing/coding staff aware of how to bill for the SBIRT (preferably CRAFFT for 12 -17yo, Annual 2 -question Screen for 18+) * oDo your providers and billing/coding staff h ave an understanding of the breaches of confidentiality that may result when explanations of benefits are delivered following a visit to a patient's parent/caregiver?

Funding priority was given to applicants that demonstrated partnership development between CCOs and SBHC medical sponsors and/or were located in rura l or frontier communities. Six communities were awarded funding from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015 to explore innovative approaches to school based care. Grant funds were used to support broader systemslevel projects, as well as more targeted projects to achieve the goals outlined in HB 2445. Grant outcomes included: increasing well care visits; achieving PCPCH recognition; developing stronger relationships with SBHC providers, CCOs and community providers; improving coordination with community providers; maximizing the role of SBHCs within the healthcare system; and exploring alternative payment methodologies. Grantees that focused on increasing adolescent well care visits employed a number of strategies including: In partnershi p with regional CCOs, empl oy member and/or provider incentives to increase the number of clients receiving well child visits. Mobilize partner agencies and/or client navigators to conduct targeted outreach to clients in need of a well care visit. Modify clinic workflows and policies to increase the num ber of well care visits provided in SBHCs, including encouraging well care visits in place of sports physicals. Expand primary care clinic hours and redirect clients from main FQHC sites to SBHCs in order to accommodate increased demand for services For more information about the SBHC Innovation Grants, please co ntact Kate O'Donnell, SBHC System Development Specialist, at kathryn.m.odonnell@state.or.us 54 "}
