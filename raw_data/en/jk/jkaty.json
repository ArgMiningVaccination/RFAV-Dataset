According to health experts , our collective actions have had a positive impact. Hospitalizations for COVID -19 infected patients in San Francisco have been stable for several weeks. However, the vast majority of t he population remains susceptible to infection, and there is not yet an effective treatment or cure for the disease. San Francisco is working on building up its testing, case findi ng, case investigation and contact tracing capacity. While that happens, it is imperative that the City extend the duration of its stay -at-home or der. At the same time, we can ease restrictions on some activities with a lower risk of spreading the virus. The City will continue to strictly apply the Order consistent with its stated intent, and you must strictly follow it. The answers to frequently asked questions below should guide your compliance. The City will keep updating this information to align with the best public health practices and any changes to the Order as circumstances evolve. We have a path forward. Everyone needs to continue to pull together \u2014and together we will get through this. STAY SAFE AT HOME EXPLAINED What does the Order do? As of May 4 , 2020, there will be a new Order that replaces the existing stay -at-home order (\"May 4 Order\") . The May 4 Order requires that most people continue sheltering in their place of residence through May 3 1, 2020. However, the new Order makes a number of significant changes, which are highlighted below: Essential Businesses: Under the new May 4 Order, all construction projects can resume, provided they comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols issued as part of the Order. Commercial as well as residential real estate transactions are allowed to fully resume, but with continued restr ictions on in -person viewings and appointments. Under the new Order, childcare establishments, and other educational and recreational programs can operate to provide care and supervision for children to allow all persons who are working in essential busin esses or outdoor businesses or performing minimum basic operations to access childcare. All of these operations must comply , to the greatest extent possible, with restrictions specified in the Order, including that they be carried out in stable groups of 12 or fewer children. This category is also subject to the State's Shelter in Place Order, but the Health Officer will assess whether to ease childcare restrictions further in coordination with the State and as the spread of COVID -19 is further contained. Rev. 5/7 /2020 2 Outdoor Businesses: Outdoor Businesses (as defined in the Order and described below) are now allowed to operate, and people are allowed to v isit them to perform work or to obtain goods, services, or supplies. Outdoor Businesses are those that normally operated primarily outdoors prior to the Shelter in Place Orders, and where social distancing of at least six feet can be maintained between all people. These include outdoor retail businesses like nurseries, outdoor service providers like landscapers, and agricultural operations. Outdoor b usinesses do not include outdoor restaurants, cafes, or bars. Social Distancing Protocols for Businesses: All business facilities operating in the County, including businesses carrying out minimum basic operations, mus t comply with the requirement to create a Social Distancing Protocol. (Note: construction activities must instead comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols.) In their Social Distancing Protocols, businesses must now ensure that personnel and customers wear face coverings when entering their facilities (except those customers for whom face coverings are not recommended, like young children). All existing Social Distancing Protocols must be updated to reflect the new requirements. We encoura ge businesses that are not yet allowed to operate to focus on planning to effectively implement social distancing and related measures in their facilities so they are ready to safely reopen when allowed. Essential Activities and Travel : All residential moves are now allowed to proceed. Recreation: The new Order allows use of shared outdoor recreational facilities that do not encourage gathering or contain high -touch equipment. However, everyone must follow any restrictions that either s tate or local authorities impose. COVID -19 Indicators : The Health Officer will consider easing or expanding restrictions based on progress we collectively achieve on several key indicators described in the new Order and referred to as the COVID -19 Indic ators. (Amended 4/29/2020) When does the new Order go into effect? The new Order is in effect starting at 11:59 p.m. on May 3 , 2020. Rev. 5/7 /2020 3 (Amended 4/29 /2020) How long does the new Order last? The new Order is currently set to last until May 3 1, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. The C ity's Health Officer may choose to shorten or extend the time period based on what the health situation demands . How long the restrictions are in place will depend on what the Health Officer decides is necessary to protect public health. (Amended 4/29 /2020) Can the new O rder be changed? Yes. The Health Officer may make changes to the new Order as more information emerges about the public health situation and may issue new orders and directive s as conditions warrant. Why aren't more businesses allowed to open? Thanks to the collective effort and sacrifice of the 7 million residents across the Bay Area, we have made progress in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed with COVID -19 cases a nd saving lives. This progress allows us to ease some restrictions to allow lower -risk outdoor businesses and outdoor activities to resume, so long as they strictly comply with social distancing requirements and other protections in the Order. The Order a lso adds certain business activities to the essential business list , including construction and commercial real estate transactions \u2014that have become critical as we gradually head into a period of expanded economic activity in which more space to accommodat e increased social distancing will be necessary. However, at this stage of the pandemic, we need to maintain most of the restrictions of shelter -in-place so that we do not lose the progress we have achieved. Lifting too many restrictions too soon could ea sily lead to a large surge in cases and result in avoidable hospitalizations and deaths, and it may also lead to longer -term economic harms. (Added 4/29 /2020) Is this mandatory or is it just guidance? It is mandatory. This Order is a legal Order issued under the authority of California law. You are required to comply, and it is a crime (a misdemeanor) not to follow the Order. I run an \"Essential Business \" or \"Outdoor Business\" as defined by the new May 4 Order. Do I need to get an official lette r of authorization from the Ci ty to operate a facility in the Ci ty? No. If your business is covered in the list of \"Essential Businesses \" or \"Outdoor Businesses\" in the Order, then you may operate your business from a facility in San Francisco so long as you create , post, and implement a Social Distancing Protocol for Rev. 5/7 /2020 4 each facility using the template attached to the Order . You do not need to obtain any spec ific authorization from the Ci ty to run your business . The Ci ty does not issue written determinations or authorizations. (Amended 4/29 /2020) Is a building that has \"Essential Businesses\" as tenants required to create and post a social distancing protocol? Or is it the responsibility of the business tenants themselves? It is the responsibility of tenant essential businesses to comply with the social distancing requirements, including creating and posting a social distancing protocol. (Added 4/7/2020) I work for an \"Essential Business \" or \"Ou tdoor Business\" as defined by the new Order. Do I need to have a letter from my employer or other documentation to travel? No. You do not need to carry official documentation (and the Ci ty does not issue any) demonstrating that you are exempt under the new Order. But be prepared to explain if requested by law enforcement why your travel is allowed under the Order. (Amended 4/29 /2020) What does it mean to \"shelter in place?\" The term \"shelter in place\" means to stay safe in your home and not leave unless necessary for one of the exceptions listed in the Order (discussed more below). I heard that there is a statewide shelter -in-place order. Do I still need to comply with San Francisco 's Order? Yes. In addition to the statewide order, the Ci ty Health Officer's Order remains in effect. All residents must comply with the restrictions in both orders . If the restrictions in the two orders are different, you must comply with the stricter of the two orders. What is the difference between \"shelter ing in place\" and \"social distancing\"? Sheltering in place is a more rigorous form of social distancing. Sheltering in place means you: Must stay at home Can only leave your home for \"essential activities\" or \"outdoor activities,\" to work for an \"essential business \" or \"outdoor businesses,\" to provide or access \"essential governmental functions,\" to perform \"minimum basic operations\" for your employer, or for \"essential travel,\" as those terms are defined in the new Order ( you can also see the FAQs for details) Cannot host or attend any gatherings Rev. 5/7 /2020 5 In addition, y ou should also maintain at least 6 feet of separation from other people who are not in your household ; wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time (or use hand sanitizer) ; cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve (not into your hands) ; wear a f ace covering when out in public ; and stay home if you are sick. (Amended 4/29 /2020) What if I am homeless? Persons experiencing homelessness are exempt from the Order's requirement that they shelter in place in their residence and its prohibition against all travel other than essential t ravel. However, individuals staying in homeless shelters sh ould stay there, and all shelter guests should wash hands frequently, and practice social distancing. Unsheltered people living in public spaces, tents, in vehicles, or otherwise unsheltered, should use the City's public restrooms and newly expanded hand -washing stations frequently, and should also practice social distancing. The Order also urges the City to keep 12x12 -foot spacing around tents and only one person per tent. The order urges the City to provide shelter to people experiencing homelessness, and the City has put in a place a program that rents hotel rooms to house people affected by the p andemic. Up-to-date information on the number of people provided emergency, temporary housing and shelter options because of the coronavirus can be found here. (Amended 4/30/2020) How do I report a business or organization that might be violating the Order and endangering the public or its employees? Call 311, except for the specific complaints listed below. Your complaint will be referred to the appropriate City agency for investigation and enforcement.

It is best to call police non -emergency dispatch at 415 -553-0123 (but if you forget that number, just call 311). (Added 4/6/2020) DAILY ACTIVITIES Can I leave home to visit friends or family members in another household or living unit if there is no urgent need or I am not performing an essential activity? No. For your safety as well as their safety, you are not allowed to visit friends or family members outside your own household .

Stores selling necessary items like grocery stores, pharmacies, and hardware stores will stay open. Please continue to buy normal quantities of these items on the same schedule you normally follow. This will ensure that there is enough for everyone. Does this order disrupt the fuel supply chain? Should I be stocking up on fuel? What about other essential supply chains, such as food?

Yes, but be sure that you distance yourself at least six feet from all others who are not part of your household. Use of enclosed dog parks is prohibited, while open spaces that allow dogs are still open. Also note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidance advising that you should t reat pets as you would your human family members \u2014do not let pets interact with people or animals outside the household. If a person inside your household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets. (Amended 4/29 /2020) Are dog walkers allowe d?

The Order exempts travel by court order or law enforcement. Can I still access necessary items in my self -storage unit? Self-storage facilities are not essential businesses, but they can maintain minimum business operations and allow people to access their units to the extent they are accessing them for medical or related needs, or in furtherance of a pre -scheduled move permitted by the Order. (Added 4/2/2020) Can common recreational space s in apartment buildings (like gyms and roof decks) stay open? No. For apartment dwellers, the Order's shelter -in-place requirements for the \"household or living unit\" means their own apartment unit, not the building or complex Rev. 5/7 /2020 10 as a whole. Common recreational spaces shared with others in the apartment building or complex, like apartment gyms, roof decks, barbecue areas, and roof decks, must be closed like any other public recreational space that contains high -touch equipment or encourages gathering .

(Added 4/6/2020 ; Amended 4/29/2020 ) FACE COVERINGS (Section added 4/20 /2020 ; Amended to include outside businesses on 4/30/2020) ) What if I can't afford to buy a face covering or can't find one for sale? You can use many household goods, including a scarf or a bandana, to make a face covering. Really all you need is a t -shirt or fabric and two rubber bands. No sewing required. Here's a how -to video that shows you how one: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent -getting -sick/diy a face covering? Normally running a non -disposable face covering through the laundry will work. Follow any care instructions that came with the face covering. More information can be found online here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent -getting -sick/diy - cloth -face-coverings.html . The Face Covering Order says masks with one -way valves cannot be used. Why not? One-way valves, which typ ically look like a raised plastic disk about the size of a quarter on the front or side of the mask, allow easy flow of your breath out of the mask when Rev. 5/7 /2020 11 you exhale. This results in an easy route for airborne droplets to be exhaled, but the purpose of the face covering is to limit droplets that you expel. For that reason, masks with one -way valves are not allowed under the Face Covering Order. The Face Covering Order talks about children 2 years old and under not being allowed to wear a face covering. Why is that? Children 2 years old and under cannot safely use a face covering. There could be a risk of suffocation for children so young. Is a child between 3 and 12 years old required to wear a face covering? No. Children from 3 to 12 years old may wea r a face covering, but it is not required. Parents and caregivers must supervise use of a face covering by children in this range in order to avoid misuse. Supervision may look different based on the age and maturity of the child. For some children, hav ing a discussion may be sufficient. For younger children, parents and caretakers should be present during use by the child. Parents and caregivers should use their judgement. I operate an essential business , outdoor business, or another business or facil ity that is permitted by the shelter in place order to engage in minimum basic operations or to provide essential infrastructure. What am I required to do under the Face Covering Order? Generally you must ensure that your employees and other staff wear a face covering in any area when working with the public or in areas where customers or the public may be present, even if there are no customers or members of the public present at the time. This is in order to avoid the spreading of respiratory droplets in areas where customers or the public may be at some point. Employees also must wear masks if co - workers are nearby. You are also required to post at sign at entrances notifying people that they are not permitted in without a face covering and that the y will not be served if they are not wearing a face covering. You should also not serve anyone over the age of 12 who is not wearing a face covering unless they are excused by the Face Covering Order from wearing a face covering. What are the reasons that someone is allowed not to wear a face covering in an essential business , outdoor business, or when around other people who are not members of their own household? The following are exceptions to the requirements for wearing a face covering when in essent ial businesses or outdoor businesses or when other people are around: - A child 12 years old or younger; - A medical professional has advised you that wearing a face covering may pose a risk Rev. 5/7 /2020 12 to your health, and you have documentation of that advisement; - Wearing a face covering would create a risk to you related to your work as determined by local, state, or federal regulators or workplace safety guidelines; - You have trouble breathing; - You are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remov e the face covering without assistance; - You have a physical disability that prevents you from wearing a face covering; - If you are deaf and use facial and mouth movements as part of communication, you can remove your mask while signing. I run an essent ial business or outdoor business . How do I deal with children who are not wearing a face covering? Children between 2 and 12 years old are not required by the Face Covering Order to wear a face covering, but they also should not jeopardize social distanc ing for others in the area. You may ask a parent or caregiver if they have a face covering they can use for a child. If the child is putting other customers or the public at risk through their conduct, you can ask the parent or caregiver to prevent that behavior. You may warn them that they may be told to leave if they cannot prevent the misconduct. Can I use a plastic Halloween mask for myself or my child as a face covering? No. Face coverings cannot cover the eyes or forehead. Also, a face covering should conform with the nose and mouth fairly well, and a rigid plastic mask would not do this. Am I required to wear a face covering when I'm driving my car? No, so long as you are the only person in your car or you are with members of your own household and nobody els e. If you operate a taxi, ride -share vehicle, or private town car, you must always wear a face covering in that vehicle regardless of whether someone else is in the vehicle in order to avoid breathing droplets that could contaminate areas w here guests or customers will sit and touch. Am I required to wear a face covering on public transit and while waiting for public transit? Yes. A face covering is required of anyone over 12 years old while waiting for or on public transit, inclu ding the operator of the vehicle . Am I allowed to take my face covering off when I am at work doing an activity authorized by the stay -at-home order and nobody else is around? Sometimes. When you are in a private office or other room where members of the public, customers, or others are not present or are unlikely to be present, you may remove the face covering. You must wear a face covering when interacting in person in the same space as others in your office or facility. You must also wear a face covering Rev. 5/7 /2020 13 in any area where customers or members of the public are likely to be present, even if they are not there at the time. Employees must wear m asks if co -workers are nearby. Do I need to wear a face covering when walking down the street or hiking? Generally, no, but sometimes you should if you cannot maintain six feet or more of distance between you and others on the sidewalk or the hiking area. When social distancing is not possible, you should put on your face covering. Do I need to wear a face covering whe n running or bicycling outside? The Order recommends that you take steps to limit the droplets that you spread when exercising. When running, biking, or doing other activities outside, you may spread droplets farther than normal. This makes the 6 -foot p hysical distance less adequate. You should avoid running or riding directly in front of or behind people or through groups of people so you don't expose yourself or others to droplets. You should have a face covering on you and wear it when you may be to o close to others while engaged in these activities. Am I required to wear a face covering at home? No. The Face Covering Order does not require you to wear a face covering at home, but if you or someone at home is sick, a face covering can be used to r educe exposure. You should contact your healthcare provider if you or someone in your home is sick. I'm going to my doctor or health care provider for an appointment. Am I required to wear a face covering? Yes. You should wear a face covering when in a n environment with other people you do not live with. But your health care provider can allow you to remove the face covering as appropriate in the context for purposes related to your care. I am unable to wear a face covering due to a health condition or physical disability, or because I rely on my mouth and face to help communicate (such as with American Sign Language). Am I required to wear a face covering? Generally no. The Face Covering O rder contains exceptions for health conditions or for those with difficulty breathing. For someone who relies on the visibility of their mouth to help communicate (such as with American Sign Language), a face covering should be used when not communicating. F or someone with a long -term condition that makes it impossible to wear a face covering, you should consult with your healthcare provider for advice on how to best protect yourself and others when in public. You should also get documentation from a medical professional showing they have advised you to not wear a face covering. Rev. 5/7 /2020 14 HEALTHCARE OPERATIONS What should I do if I'm sick? If I or a family member need immediate medical attention, can I leave home to go to the doctor or hospital? Call 911 or go to an emergency room if you are experiencing a medical emergency. If you are feeling sick, first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center before going to the hospital. Do not go to the emergency room of a hospital unless you are having an actual emergency. But you can and should seek medi cal advice if you or a family member is sick. If it is not an emergency, please contact your primary care provider to determine next steps. Also, you can check online resources to help you assess symptoms if you are worried about whether you or a loved o ne has COVID -19. You should check https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/index.html for more information. Can I get my prescriptions or other healthcare needs? Can I leave home to go to the pharmacy to get my prescription filled? Yes. Drug stores and other medical supply stores are allowed and encouraged to operate. When possible , you should have prescription medicines and healthcare supplies delivered to your home. I have a d octor's appointment next week for routine medical care or an elective procedure. Can I go to that appointment? Probably not. Under a separate order (Order No. C19 -08), the Health Officer has ordered all medical providers (such as doctors, dentists, and ophthalmologists) and healing arts practitioners (such as massage therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncturists) to postpone routine appointments and elective surgeries except in certain situations. You should contact your healthcare provider to discuss w hether your appointment or procedure can be postponed without a negative medical or health impact on you. If so, it should be postponed or conducted remotely. Even if your appointment is essential and cannot be postponed, your appointment should occur remotely if possible. Medical providers and healing arts practitioners can only permit an essential, in -person appointment after doing a screening of you by phone in advance for symptoms and following protective Social Distancing Requirements. (Added 4/2/2020) Q: Can our hospital or outpatient surgery center start to perform elective surgeries? A: No, not yet. San Francisco Health Officer Order No. C19 -08 (available online here) prohibits most elective surgeries from occurring. The Health Officer is working on a revision to that order that will permit elective surgeries to occur subject to specific safety protocols to avoid putting the patient or the surg ical staff at undue risk. The new order Rev. 5/7 /2020 15 is expected to be issued before May 11, 2020. By contrast, UCSF has different rules that apply because it is a state institution. It has recently begun performing elective surgeries according to its own safety pro tocols under the state health order. (Added 5/6 /2020) Q: I work at a doctor's office, health clinic, dental office, talking therapy office, physical therapy office, acupuncture studio, or other licensed provider of Healing Arts that is licensed by the State of California. I know the state is starting to re - open certain activities. Can my office start providing care to clients or patients in person? A: No, not yet, with a few exceptions. San Francisco Health Officer Order No. C19 -08 (available onlin e here) currently allows certain doctors, dentists, counselors, and other Healing Arts practitioners to meet with patients or clients in person for essential care where a patient or client would suffer a negative medical or health impact without the care and where certain infection control practices are in place. That order also permits all tele -medicine or remote visits to occur. Other clinical visits are n ot yet allowed. The Health Officer is working on a revision to that order that will permit clinical visits to occur subject to specific safety protocols to avoid putting the patient/client or the office staff at undue risk. The new order is expected to b e issued before May 11, 2020. (Added 5/6 /2020) Can I still go to my mental health or counseling appointments? Probably not in person, but you can participate remotely. Under a separate order (Order No. C19 -08), the Health Officer has ordered all counselors, including psychologists, marriage and family therapist, and licensed clinical social workers, to postpone i n-person routine counseling appointments or conduct them by phone or videoconference. You should contact your mental health provider or counselor to discuss whether your appointment can be held via phone or videoconference, can be postponed, or should pro ceed in person.

Childcare facilities need to comply with the following conditions in the Order to the extent possible: 1. Childcare must be carried out in stable groups of 12 or fewer . \"Stable\" means that the same 12 or fewer children are in the same group each day. 2.

Rev. 5/7 /2020 32 No. The Outdoor Businesses that are allowed to operate are considered low risk because they are outdoors and because they involve only brief and infrequent interactions among individuals. Training sessions and group exercise classes involve prolonged per son-to-person interactions, even if outdoors. Also, they are higher risk because exercise causes people to more forcefully expel airborne particles, making the usual social distancing measures less adequate to prevent transmission. (Added 5/4/2020) Are photographers permitted to work under the new May 4 order? Yes, photographers are permitted to work as follows. First, photography related to news/journalism is permitted under the exception for \"Newspapers, television, radio, and ot her media services.\" Second, p ersonal outdoor photography is allowed as a permissible outdoor activity.

This means that any employee necessary for the transport, preparation and/or processing of a body may continu e to report to these facilities to conduct their work. Are office supply stores, stationary stores, and art supply stores essential businesses since they supply products needed for people to work from home? No. Businesses that supply products needed for people to work from home are no longer classified as essential businesses in the new order. Accordingly, they must temporarily close retail locations within the City, but they may deliver directly to residences and businesses and continue minimum basic op erations. (Added 4/3/2020) My business manufactures, supplies, or repairs cell phones. Can it stay open? Yes. If your business is primarily engaged in supply or repair of cell phones or other telecommunications devices, then it is essential and may contin ue to operate under the Order for that purpose. (Added 4/29/2020) Rev. 5/7 /2020 33 CONSTRUCTION AND ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE Are commercial, residential, and mixed -use construction projects allowed to proceed? Yes. The Order allows all construction projects, including public works, public facilities, commercial, residential, and mixed -use projects, as well as remodel and renovation work, to proceed, as long as the projects comply with the Construction Safety Protocols listed in Appendices B-1 and B-2 of the Order. This range of construction projects is consistent with those that are permitted under the March 19, 2020 Order of the California State Public Health Officer (the \"State Shelter Order\"). The State Shelter Order allows wo rkers to leave home who support the construction, operation, inspection, and maintenance of construction sites and construction projects, workers who support the supply chain of building materials, and workers who provide services that enable repair materi als and equipment for essential functions. May public works construction projects, such as schools, public buildings, street improvements, and transport ation infrastructure, continue? Yes, as long as the projects comply with the Construction Safety Protocols listed in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order, or other safety protocol that the Health Officer specifies for public works construction projects. May I get building permits or site inspections from the City for my construction project? Yes. You may contact the relevant agency to determine how to arrange the service you need. I have Code violations on my property and have been ordered to correct the violations. Can the abatement work be done while the Shelter in Place Order is in effect? Yes. This work must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order, or the Social Distancing Protocol s in Appendix A, as applicable. May I conduct site assessment, remediation, or mitigation work that I have been directed to perform? Yes. This work must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order or the Social Distancing Protocol s in Appendix A, as applicable. Rev. 5/7 /2020 34 My business installs distributed solar, storage, and/or electric vehicle charging systems - may it continue to operate? Yes, this is permissible construction activity and must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendix B -1 or B -2 of the Order. Businesses may also operate to manufacture d istributed energy resource compone nts, like solar panels. Will private and public construction projects that are already underway be required to stop work if they cannot meet the safety protocols when the April 29th Order goes into effect on Monday? Yes. The projects must comply with the new protocols in order to proceed. In San Francisco, a Public Works Protocol will be issued, which must be followed for projects to proceed. The Public Works Protocol will be substantially similar to protocols currently in place, which the City developed in collaboration with indu stry and labor representatives. Will all project have to stop work or delay start of construction until they have a trained third -party supervisor on site? The third party supervisor does not ne ed to be on site for the project to start, but must be ready to make site visits shortly thereafter. A company may use an outside consultant or contractor, or train one of their existing employees as needed. Projects may continue, and should make steps t o have such a supervisor shortly. San Francisco does not have a training program for this supervisor, but industry groups may be able to help identify and train so that t he industry can proceed safely. How will the definition of a large construction proje ct that contains 5 or more workers at a construction site be applied? This definition only applies to construction of Essential Infrastructure, as defined in Section 16.c of the Order. Essential Infrastructure includes airports, utilities (including water , sewer, gas, and electrical), oil refining, roads and highways, public transportation, solid waste facilities (including collection, removal, disposal, recycling, and processing facilities), cemeteries, mortuaries, crematoriums, and telecommunications sys tems (including the provision of essential global, national, and local infrastructure for internet, computing services, business infrastructure, communications, and web -based services). In San Francisco, many of those are public works projects, which will be governed by the Public Works Protocol. The health officers made this determination in order to maximize safety for workers and the community. How will the staggering requirements for co nstruction projects be applied? The requirements to stagger trade -specific work and work schedules are intended to minimize the number of workers at the jobsite at any one time. It is not an absolute requirement to stagger all trades and workers at all times, because in some instances more than one trade will be necessary to be on site. In those instances, the direction is Rev. 5/7 /2020 35 to minimize as much as possible. For smaller projects, Appendix B -1 provides that construction sites should stagger trades as necessary to reduce density and allow f or easy maintenance of minimum six -foot separation. For larger construction projects, Appendix B -2 provides for 2 kinds of staggering. First, construction sites should stagger stop- and start -times for shift schedules to reduce the quantity of workers at the jobsite at any one time to the extent feasible . Second, construction sites should stagger trade - specific work to minimize the quantity of workers at the jobsite at any one time. The focus of this second requirement is to minimize the number of worke rs on the site and is not a prohibition against combining trades on -site. Does the Order allow for state -mandated testing, operator inspections, and repairs of underground storage tanks? Yes. State -mandated tests and operator inspections of underground storage tanks are essential activities and should continue under the Order. Repairs necessary to maintain the safety of underground storage tank systems and activities to respond to alarms and address unauthorized releases are also essential and should continue. All such work must be conducted in accordance with the Order, including adhering to social distancing requirements. (Amended 5/1/2020) GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Is the local government shutting down? No. Essential government al functions will continue, including first responders, emergency management personnel, emergency dispatchers, and law enforcement. Other government al functions or offices may be subject to reduced schedu les or may be closed as part of the effort to fight the spread of COVID -19. Each government agency identifies the services that qualify as Essential Governmental Functions, and designates the personnel who will continue providing those functions. I work for the government \u2014Can I continue to go to work? As a g overnment employee , you can continue to go to work if your employer designate s you as an essential employee. Each government al agency is responsible for determining which of its workers are essential workers. Can I get a building permit or building inspection from the Department of Building Inspection for my construction project , or make sure my business gets the Fire Department 's fire safety and hazmat inspection that I need to keep operating? Contact the relevant city agency to determine if it is still providing the service you need as an essential governmental function. Rev. 5/7 /2020 36 TRAVEL AND RECREATION I don't have a car. Can I ride the bus or train , or can I get a ride in my favorite ride-share/on -demand car service or a taxi?

I get anxious when I'm cooped up in side. Am I allowed to go on a hike? Can I go to a park or open space? Yes. Spending time outside improves mood and well -being, and is particularly beneficial to children. You can go for walks, go to the park, and enjoy other outdoor activities. But operators of parks, beaches, and other open spaces may restrict entry, close certain areas, or close the whole facility altogether if the Health Officer orders those measures to reduce crowding and limit risk of COVID -19 exposure . Rev. 5/7 /2020 38 While you're on a hike or enjoying an open space area, you must strictly follow social distancing requirements , including maintaining a distance of at least six feet from everyone outside your household or living unit.
