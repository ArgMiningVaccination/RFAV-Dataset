Schneider DC, PhD lowering drugs (statins). Any patient who has been diagnosed with FM should make absolutely sure that the diagnosis is correct before seeking treatment for FM. The standard medical treatment for FM involves a three-tiered approach: 1. Prescription medications for pain and sleep, which drugs such as: pregabalin (Lyrica\u00ae) duloxetine (Cymbalta\u00ae) amitriptyline (Elavil\u00ae). 2. Low-intensity exercise, which is typically performed under the guidance of a physical therapist. 3. Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a short course of psychological counseling to help patients cope with chronic pain. While the standard medical approach is helpful for many patients, given that this is a chronic condition, patients often experience persistent pain and disability. This leads many to seek complementary therapies. In a Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common condition that involves two key symptoms: widespread pain and fatigue. The pain of FM was originally thought to be due to some unknown type of soft tissue inflammation, and was therefore treated with steroids and nonsteroidal medications, such as ibuprofen. However, research did not find any such soft tissue inflammation, and now most researchers believe that the pain of FM comes from \"abnormal circuitry\" in the brain and spinal cord. For reasons that are still unknown, certain patients will develop FM after a physical injury, such as whiplash or a severe back injury. These patients do have inflammation of certain muscles and joints immediately following their injury. The inflammation gradually subsides, but the pain gradually spreads from the original areas of injury and becomes widespread. Somehow the central nervous system malfunctions and continues to perpetuate the pain. There is much misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of FM. The symptoms of widespread pain and fatigue found in FM are also found in many other common medical conditions, including hypothyroidism, anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme disease, and even diabetes. Patients with FM also may have myofascial pain, which is due to muscular \"knots\" called trigger points that develop in taut bands of muscle tissues. These trigger points can be successfully treated with various types of soft tissue mobilization and massage techniques. Lastly, several vitamin deficiencies and metabolic conditions may mimic FM. These include low vitamin D levels, low magnesium, hidden food allergies, and reactions to medications such as cholesterol- Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S.

While we don't offer hot mineral baths, these other CAM therapies are offered at the Center for Integrative Medicine. We have found a combination of the supportive CAM therapies, along with active exercise and stress management activities, to be the most helpful. 1. Terhorst L., Schneider M. J., Kim K.

I was volunteering at a senior's home when I was first introduced to Shiatsu and its beneficial effects. A woman of 82, whom I had been visiting often, was receiving a Shiatsu treatment one day when I came calling. After the session, she was visibly changed. She appeared refreshed, clear-minded, and vivacious. She got out of her usual recliner, stretched her arms wide, and requested that we go on our first-ever walk. I was so happy for her, and I was quite impressed. What made you decide to learn more and become an advanced practitioner? I had been studying biology and psychology, and was immediately impressed that one discipline, such as Shiatsu, could bridge mind and body seamlessly, not to mention facilitate health of the whole being by activating the person's own internal healing resources. Having grown up with the Western mode of thinking that a cure for illness usually comes from outside the person, I was completely fascinated by Shiatsu's theory, which provides evidence that a person can generate healing and a balanced self from within, with the aid of conscious touch from a skilled practitioner. In developing the field, did the original Japanese masters put a special spin on some of the Chinese bodywork practices? Chinese medicine was introduced to the Japanese in the sixth century AD. Over hundreds of years, practices of Japanese bodywork and massage were blended with the ancient Chinese wisdom. The Western science of anatomy and physiology was introduced in the early 1900s as Shiatsu was gaining its presence as a professional healing modality. There are many forms of Shiatsu today, most of which marry beautifully the Eastern and Western models of disease and health. I practice a form called Zen Shiatsu, founded by the late Shizuto Masunaga. Masunaga's system extends the classical acupuncture meridians through each limb of the body, providing a relaxing and restorative bodywork therapy for the receiver. Shiatsu, like acupuncture, can be used to treat a wide variety of specific physical ailments, as well as to bring peace and resilience to the mind and spirit. Happy Holidays!
