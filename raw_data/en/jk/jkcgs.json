At the foundation of this endeavor was a desire to meaningfully engage and gather important input from residents, community-based organizations, c linical and social service providers, public health officials, elected/appointed officials, medical center leadership, and other key collaborators throughout the medical center's C ommunity Benefits Service Area. Substantial efforts were m ade to ensure that all segments of the community had t he opportunity to participate, with an intentional focus on engaging cohorts who have been historically underserved. BIDMC, including the BIDMC Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) which oversaw the CHN A process, extends its sincere appreciation to ev eryone who invested time, effort, and expertise to ensure the development of the medical center's CHNA and Implementation Strategy (IS). BIDMC thanks the Steering Committee of the Boston Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)-CommunityHealth Improvement Plan (CHIP) Collaborative (Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative) for their collaboration in this assessment process. The Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative, comprised of teaching hospitals and medical centers in the Boston area, community health centers, the Boston Public Health Commission, community-based organizations, and residents, hired Health Resources in Action to support their effort. The Steering Committee engaged the City of Boston's Human Services Department to serve as a backbone organization to the CHNA and IS with a specific focus on providing coordination on execution of the IS. Per federal and Commonwealth requirements, local health departments must be involved in CHNA activities, and the Boston Public Health Commission more than fulfilled this requirement. Special thanks are also due to the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment initiative for their support and their contributions to this a ssessment.

Health Needs Assessment Introduction Back ground Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) is one of the nat ion's preeminent academic medical centers and is nationally recognized for its world-class clinical expertise, education, and research. In 2019, as part of a merge r of two health systems in the greater Boston regio n, BIDMC became part of Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH ) - a system of academic medical centers, teaching hospit als, community hospitals, and specialty hospitals with mo re than 35,000 caregivers and staff who are collaborating in new ways across professional roles, sites of care, and regions to make a difference for patients, communities, and one another. BIDMC is one of BILH's premier institutions, with 673 licensed beds and over 1,200 activ e physicians. The medical center is also a Level 1 trauma ce nter with a full range of medical/surgical, critical care, OB/GYN, and emergency services, and an extensive netw ork of primary care and ou tpatient specialty care practices. BIDMC prides itself on its ability to combine exceptional and compassionate patient care with advanced med ic al knowledge, research, and technology in ways that al low it to achieve the best outcomes for its patients. BIDMC , in partnership with the BILH system, is committed to prov iding the very best care and strives to improve the healt h of the people and families in its Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA). This 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) repo r t is an integral part of BIDMC's population health and community engagement efforts. It supplies vital information that is applied to make sure that the services and programs that B IDMC pr ovid es are appropriately focu sed, delivered in ways that are responsive to those in its CBSA, and address unmet community needs. This assessment, along with the associated prioritization and plann ing processes, also provides a critical opportunity for BIDMC to engage the community and strengthen the community partnerships that are essential to its success now and in the future. The assessment engaged thousands of people from across the CBSA, including local public health officials, clinical and social service providers, community-based organizations, first responders (e.g., police, fire department, and ambulance officials), other government officials, faith-based leaders, and community residents. The process that was applied to conduct the CHNA and develop the associated Implementation Strategy (IS) exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and community engagement that is such a vital part of BIDMC's mission.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 7Finally, this report allows BIDMC to meet its federal and Com monwealth c ommunity b enefits requireme nts per the federal Internal Revenue Service, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the Mas sachusetts Attorney General's Offic e, and the Massachusetts Department of Publi c Health. Purpose The CHNA is at the heart of BIDMC's commi tment to promotin g health and well-being , add ressin g health disparities, and w orking to achieve health equity. Health equity - the attainment of the highest level of health for all people - requires focused and o ngoing efforts to address the inequities an d socioeconomic bar riers to accessing care, and the current an d historical discrimi nation and injusti ces that underlie exis ting disparities. Throughout the assessment proces s, efforts were made to understand the needs of the commun ities that BIDMC se rves, especially the population segments th at are often disadvantaged, face disparities in heal th-related outcomes, and who have be en historically under served. BIDMC completed its last CHNA in 2019 and the report, along with the associated 2020-2022 IS, was approved by the BIDMC Board of Trustees on Sep tember 18, 2019. The 2019 CHNA report was posted on BIDMC's website before September 30, 2019 and, per federal compliance requirements, ma de available in paper copy, without charge , upon request . The assessmen t and p lannin g work for this current report was conducted between September 2021 and S eptember 2022, and B IDMC's Board of Trustees approved the 2022 CHNA report and ad opted the 2023- 2025 IS, included as Attachment E, on September 21, 2022.Definition o f Community S e rved The federal government and the Commonwealth require that nonprofit hospi tals engage their communities and cond uct comprehensive CHNAs that identify the leading health issues, barriers to care, and service gaps for people who live and/or work within the medical center's designated CBSA. Understanding the geographic and demographic characteristics of BIDMC's CBSA is critical to reco gnizing inequities, identifying priority cohorts, and deve loping f ocused s tra tegic r esponses. Des cription of Community Benefits Service Area BIDMC's main campus is in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston, where it operates a Level 1 trauma center and prov ides a full range of medical, surgical, critical care, OB/ GYN, and emergency services. In addition to the medical cente r facility in the Longwood area, BIDMC operates licensed multi-specialty outpatient facilities in Chelsea, Lexington, and Chestnut Hill*, the BIDMC Cancer Center in Ne ed ham, the BIDMC Pain Center in Brookline, and infusion centers in Burlington and Peabody. BIDMC also operates a lice nsed health center in Bowdoin/Geneva and has strong, long -standing partnerships with five Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Four of these FQHCs - Charles River Community Health, The Dimock Center, Fenway Health, and South Cove Community Health Center - are loca ted in BIDMC's CBSA and the fifth - Outer Cape Health Services - i s in Barnstable Cou nt y, Massachusetts. T hese FQHCs are key community benefits partners as they are rooted in their communities and are dedicated to treating those who are historically underserved. These FQHCs have been a vital part of BIDMC's community health strategy since 1968, when the medical center first joined forces with *Chestnut Hill - a village west of Boston - is located partially within Brookline and partially within Newton. Throughout this report, data for Brookline and Newton are included if data was unavailable for Chestnut Hill.8 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment The Dimock Center to address maternal and child health issues. BIDMC's CBSA does not include a contiguous set of geographic c ommunities. R ather, p er federal r equirements, it is d efi ned as the cities and towns that are part of the Com munity Care Alliance and/or where BIDMC operates licensed facilities. BIDMC's CHNA focused on identifying the leading community health needs and priority cohorts livi ng and/or working within its CBSA. In recognition of the con siderable health disparities that exist in some commu nities in its CBSA, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its commu nity benefits resources on improving the health stat us of those who face health disparities, experience pove rty, or who have been historically underserved living in the city of Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/ Kenmore, Mission Hill, and Roxbury. Wh il e there are segments of the populations in Brookline, Burlington, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, Needham, and Peabody who are vulnerable and have limited access to the care they need, the greatest disparities exist for those who live in Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods that are part of the CBSA. By prioritizing these cohorts, BIDMC can promote health and well-being, address health disparities, and maximize the impact of its community benefits resources. Further, while BIDMC operates licensed facilities in Burlington, Needham and Peabody, these service locations are in other BILH CBSAs. The Town of Burlington and the City of Peabody are located within Lahey Hospital and Medical Center's (LHMC) CBSA and the Town of Needham is located within Beth Israel Deaconess- Needham's (BID Needham) CBSA. As a result, the community benefits activities for these municipalities have been delegated to LHM C and BID Needham. This helps to ensure that activities are properly coordinated and address the identified needs. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 9Approach It would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to community engagement a nd a comprehensive, data- driven, collaborative, and transparent assessment and planning process. Rather than conducting a single assessment, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff, along with its CBAC, dedicated hours of their time and other resources to participate in and gather information from three concurrent a ssessments. T he firs t of these assessments was BIDMC's own CBSA assessment, w hic h engaged l ocal p ublic h ealth o fficia ls, clinical and social service providers, community-based organ izations, first responders (e.g., police, fire department, and a mb ulance officials), faith leaders, government officials, and community residents. This CBSA assessment gathered quantitative and qualitative information from all of the municipalities that are part of BIDMC's CBSA. In addition to its own CBSA assessment, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff gathered information from two other assessments conducted by organizations or collectives of organizations in Boston and/or Chelsea: 1) The Boston Community Health Needs Assessment-Community Health Improvement Plan Collaborative (Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative), and 2) The North Suffolk Community Needs Assessment. The Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative, consisting of Boston's hospitals and community health centers, the Boston Public Health Commission, community-based organizations, and community residents, conducted a robust and collaborative community health needs assessment for the City of Boston as a whole. Facilitated through the Conference of Boston Teaching Hospitals (COBTH) and the City of Boston's Human Services Department, the Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative assessment focused on the social determinants of health through the lens of health equity; it aimed to uncover and understand how and why individuals in certain Boston neighborhoods or population groups experience inequities in health outcomes and barriers to care based on socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, language, health status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. The overall approach was participatory and collaborative, engaging community residents throughout the CHNA process. Nancy Kasen, Beth Israel Lahey Health's Vice President of Community Benefits and Community Relations, served as the founding Co-Chair of the Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative Steering Committee and continues to serve on its SteeringCommittee and workgroups. Robert Torres, BILH's Director of Community Benefits for the Boston region, served as the Co-Chair of the Community Engagement Workgroup for the 2022 CHNA. The North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative Community Needs Assessment was a comprehensive assessment and planning effort which gathered information from a broad geographic area to the north of Boston, including Chelsea. The assessment was overseen by a steering committee comprised of municipal leaders, community organizations, and representatives from the five health systems that serve the North Suffolk region. Kelina Orlando, BIDMC Executive Director of Ambulatory Operations served on the assessment's Steering Committee and participated in the primary data collection process. The Steering Committee was responsible for monitoring the completion of assessment tasks, c oordinating communication efforts with key partners and the public-at-large, and making final decisions on priority areas and strategies. Robert Torres, BILH's Director of Community Benefits for the Boston region, and Danelle Marable, BILH's Director of Data and Evaluation for Community Benefits and Community Relations, worked with the Steering Committee to help design data collection tools. The ass essment was comprehensive in nature, including quantitative data and information gathered from a series of community meetings led by the City of Chelsea on how best to use funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). Qualitative information was gathered through a survey, which collected information from more than 493 respondents in Chelsea, focus groups, and interviews. In total, the assessment effort included 6 focus groups with service providers in Chelsea and 29 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. The Steering Committee worked with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to identify key assessment findings, identify community health priorities and priority populations for investment, and develop the CHNA r eport and a community health improvement plan (CHIP). Additional information on the North Suffolk Community Needs Assessment is provided in Appendix A. BIDMC also participated in the BILH CHNA process and collaborated with Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital- Needham (BID Needham), Lahey Hospital & Medical Center (LHMC), and New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH). With respect to BID Needham, BIDMC and BID Assessment Approach & Methods10 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Needham both include Needham in their CBSAs. With respect to LHMC, BIDMC and LHMC both include Burlington and Peabody in their CBSAs. With respect to NEBH, BIDMC and NEBH both include Mission Hill, Chestnut Hill, and Brookline in their CBSAs. BIDMC shared the information they gathered on these overlapping neighborhood, cities and towns with its other BILH hospital partners as part of its processes. It should be noted that the collaborative activities referenced above were bi-directional, meaning that each institution shared quantitative and qualitative findings that they gathered on the overlapping neighborhoods and municipalities with the other institutions. Involvement in these concurrent efforts allowed BIDMC and the other hospitals involved to fully leverage the breadth of resources being invested across their CBSA to understand community need and system capacity, while not unduly burdening the community. This involvement also facilitated important and valuable collaboration between BIDMC and the other health service organizations outside of the CHNA process. Finally, BIDMC also integrated the extensive, ongoing community engagement and planning that the medical center is conducting as part of its Massachusetts Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community- based Health Initiative. These activities focused on the Boston neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA. Since this work began in 2019, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff have conducted a broad range of community en gagement activities, including a series of community listening sessions that gathered information from residents in each of the six neighborhoods in Boston that are part of BID MC's C BSA. Combined, these efforts helped to ensure that a sound, objective, and inclusive CHNA process was conducted across BIDMC's entire CBSA. This process involved extensive data collection activities, substantial efforts to en gage BIDMC's partners and community residents, and th oughtful prioritization, planning, and reporting processes. Sp ecial care was taken across all the assessment's in dividual components to include the voices of community residents who have been historically underserved, such as those who are unstably housed or homeless, those who do not speak English, those who are recent immigrants, those who are in substance use recovery, and those who experience barriers and disparities due to their race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, disability status, or other personal characteristics. The CHNA and IS development process was guided by the following p rinciples: equity, collaboration, engagement, capacity building, and intentionality. Equity: Work toward the systemic, fair, and just treatment of all people. Collaboration: Leve rage resour ces to achieve greater impact by working with community residents and organizations. Engagement: Intentionally outreach to and interact with hardly reached populations; including but not limited to people impacted by trauma, people with disabilities, people most impacted by inequ ities, and others. Capacity Building: Build commun ity cohesion a nd capa city by co-leading community listening sessions and training comm unity residents on facilitation. Intentionality: Be deliberate in requests for and use of data and information; be purposeful and work collaborat ively to identi fy and leverage resources for maximum benefit. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 11The BIDMC CHNA and planning process was conducted between September 2021 and September 2022 in three phases, w hich are detailed in the table below.

(JSI), a public health consulting firm based in Boston, to integrate the information gathered across these concurrent assessments and augment the information gathered, where appropriate. BIDMC worked with JSI to ensure that the final BIDMC CHNA engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated comprehensive quantitative information for all communities in its CBSA, and fulfilled federal and Commonwealth community benefits requirements. Methods Oversight and Advisory Structures The CBAC greatly informs BIDMC's assessment and planning activities. BIDMC's CBAC is made up of staff from the medical center's Community Benefits Department, other medical center administrative/clinical staff, and members of the medical center's Board of Trustees. Perhaps more importantly, the CBAC includes representatives from: Additional municipal staff (such as elected officials, planning, etc.) Education Community Health Centers Housing (such as community development corporations, local public housing authority, etc.) Local Public Health Departments/Boards of Health Regional planning and transportation agencies Social services Private sectors Community-based organizations. These institutions are committed to serving residents throughout the CBSA and are particularly focused on meeting the needs of those who are medically underserved, those experiencing poverty, and those who face inequitiesdue to their race, ethnicity, spoken language, national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability status, immigration status, or other personal characteristics. Th e involvement of BIDMC's staff in the CBAC promotes tra nsparency and communication and ensures that there is a dir ect link between BIDMC and many of the community's leading health and social service community-based org anizations. The CBAC meets quarterly to support BIDMC's community benefits work and met six times d uring the CHNA and planning process. During these meetings, the CBAC provided valuable input on the assessment approach and community engagement s trategies, vetted preliminary findings, and helped to prioritize community health issues and the cohorts experiencing or at-risk for health inequities. All BIDMC CBAC meetings are open to the public and the CBAC welcomes oral and written comments. Quantitative Data Collection To meet the federal and Commonwealth community benefits requirements, BIDMC collected a range of quantitative data to characterize the communities in its CBSA. BIDMC also gathered data to help identify leading health-related issues, barriers to accessing care, and service gaps. Whenever possible, data was collected f or specific g eographic, demographic, or socioeconomic segments of12 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Demographic, SES* & SDOH** DataCommonwealth/National Health Status DataHospital Utilization Data Municipal Data Sources Age, SOGI***, race, ethnicity Vital statistics Inpatient discharges Public school districts Poverty, employment, education Behavioral risk factors Emergency department dischargesLocal assessments and reports Crime/violence Disease registries Food access Substance use data Housing/transportation COVID-19 Community Impact Survey *Socioeconomic status **Social determinants of health ***Sexual orientation and gender identity the population to identify disparities and clarify the needs for specific communities. The data was tested for statistical significance whenever possible and compared against data at the regional, Commonwealth, and national levels to support analysis and the prioritization p rocess. The assessment also included data compiled at the local level from school districts, police/fire departments, and other sources. A databook that includes all the quantitative datagathered for this assessment is included in Appendix B. Every effort was made to leverage any data that could be brought to bear on BIDMC's CBSA. However, this methodology highlight ed the limitations that the assessment faced due to gaps in the availability of Boston data at the n eighborhood-level. Community Engagement and Qualitative Data Collection Authentic community engagement is critical to assessing community needs, identifying the leading community health priorities, prioritizing cohorts most at-risk, and crafting a collaborative, evidence-informed IS. Accordingly, BIDMC applied Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Community Engagement Standards for Community Health Planning to guide engagement. 1 To meet these standards, BIDMC employed a variety of strategies to help ensure that community members were informed, consulted, involved, and empowered throughout the assessment process. Across all four components, the assessment included 85 one-on-one interviews with key collaborators in the community, 22 focus groups with segments of the population facing the greatest health-related disparities, and community listening sessions that engaged 226 participants. In addition, BIDMC's BILH partners, BID Needham and LHMC, conducted a community health survey, which gathered information from more than 1,400 community residents from BID Needham's and LHMC's CBSAs, including 346 residents from Needham, 155 residents of Burlington, and 180 residents of Peabody. BID Needham and LHMC shared this information with BIDMC. The Boston Public Health Commission fielded a COVID-19 Health Equity Survey in December 2020/January 2021; as such, BIDMC, based on recommendations from the Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative Steering Committee, opted not to field the BILH Community Health Survey in Boston. This survey of a random sample of over 1,650 residents in multiple languages examined issues related to job loss, food insecurity, access to services, mental health, vaccination, and perceptions of risk around COVID-19. The North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative also fielded a community health survey. The survey collected data from 1,401 respondents from Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop. Results were stratified by community, age group, gender, race, ethnicity, and language. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 13Appendix A of this report contains a comprehensive community engagement summary detailing how these acti vities were conducted, who was involved and what was learned. Also included in Appendix A are copies of the in terview, focus group, and listening session guides, summaries of findings, and other related materials. Survey materials for the BILH Community Health Survey and the North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative are included in Appendix B. I nve ntory of Community Resources Community Benefits staff created a resource inventory of services available to address community needs. The inve ntory includes resources across the broad continuum of serv ices, i ncluding: Domestic violence Food assistance Housing Mental health and substance use Senior se rvices Transportation . The resource inventory was compiled using information from e xisting resource inventories and partner lists from BIDM C. Community Benefits staff reviewed BIDMC's prior annua l report of community benefits activities submitted to t he M assachusetts Attorney General's Office, which incl uded a listing of partners, as well as publicly available list s of local resources. The goal of this process was to iden tify key partners who may or may not be already colla borating with BIDMC or working to address identified need s in BIDMC's CBSA. The resource inventory can be found in Appendix C. Prioritization, Planning, and Reporting At the ou tset of the strategic planning and reporting phase of the project, community listening sessions were organized with the public-at-large, including community re sidents, representatives from clinical and social service providers, and other community-based organizations that p rovide services throughout the CBSA. This was the first step in the prioritization process and allowed the community to discuss the assessment's findings and formally prioritize the issues that they believed were most important, using an interactive and a nonymous polling software. These sessions also allowed participants to share their ideas on existing community assets and strengths, as well as the services, programs, and strategies that should be implemented to address the issues identified.After the community listening sessions, the BIDMC CBAC was e ngag ed. T he CB AC w as updated o n ass essm ent progress and was provided the opportunity to vet and comment on preliminary findings. The CBAC then participated in their own prioritization process using the same set of interactive and anonymous polls, which allowed them to identify a set of community health priorities and the cohorts that they believed should be considered for prioritization as the medical center developed its IS. After the prioritization process, a CHNA report was developed and the medical center's existing IS was augmented, revised, and tailored. In developing the IS, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff took care to retain the community health initiatives that worked well and that aligned with the identified priorities from the 2022 assessment , but also posed strategies to address the newly identified priorities. The Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative also conducted an extensive series of prioritization and planning meetings to facilitate the development of a city-wide Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative developed a summary and full report of findings, which was extensively referenced to develop this report. The full Boston CHNA-CHIP C ollaborative report is provided in Appendix A. After drafts of the CHNA report and IS were developed, they were shared with BIDMC's senior leadership team for input and comment. BIDMC Community Benefits staff then reviewed these inputs and incorporated elements, as appropriate, before the final 2022 CHNA report and 2023-2025 IS were submitted to BIDMC's Board of Trustees for a pproval. After the Board of Trustees formally approved the 2022 CHNA report and adopted the 2023-2025 IS, these documents were posted on BIDMC's website, alongside the 2019 CHNA report and 2020-2022 IS, for easy viewing and download. As with all BIDMC CHNA processes, these documents are made available to the public whenever requested, anonymously and free of charge. It should also be noted that BIDMC's Community Benefits staff have mechanisms in place to receive written comments on the most recent CHNA and IS, although no comments have been received since the last CHNA and IS were made available.14 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Questions regarding the 2022 assessment and planning process or past assessment processes should be directed to: Robert Torres Director, Community BenefitsBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center330 Brookline Ave.Boston, MA 02115robert.torres@bilh.org508-830-2029Nancy RelationsBeth Lahey Ave.Boston, MA 02115nancy.kasen@bilh.org617-667-2607 Beth Israel Medical 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 15Assessment F indings Th is section provides a comprehensive review of the findings from this assessment. This se ction draws on quantitative data from a variety of sources and qualitative information co llected from local public health officials, clinical and social service providers, community- based organizations, first responders (e.g., police, fire department and ambulance officials), faith leaders, other government officials, and community residents engaged in supporting the h ealth and well-being of residents throughout BIDMC's CBSA. Findings are organized into the f ollowing ar eas: Community Characteristics Social Determinants of Health Systemic Factors Behavioral Factors Health Conditions. Each section begins with a highlight of key findings. This introduction is followed by graphs an d other data visuals. It is important to note that these five sections do not review all of the fin dings collected during the assessment, rather they draw out the most significant drivers of health status and health disparities. A databook that includes all the quantitative data gathered for this assessment, along with materials related to interivews, focus groups, and listening sessions are included in A ppendices A and B. Please n ote: Data has been reported for the Boston neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA when possible. When data was not available at the neighborhood level, then data was reported for the City of Boston overall. It should also be noted that BIDMC's CBSA includes Chestnut Hill - a village west of Boston - which is located partially within Brookline and partially within Newton. Data for both municipalities were included in this report when data for Chestnut Hill was unavaila ble. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 15 Community Characteristics A description of the population's demographic characteristics and trends lays the foundation for understanding community needs and health status. This information is critical to recognizing health inequities and identifying communities and population segments that are disproportionately impacted by health issues and other social, economic, and systemic factors. This information is also critical to BIDMC's and its partners' efforts to develop its IS, as it must focus on specific segments of the population that face the greatest health-related challenges. The assessment gathered a range of information related to age, race/ethnicity, nation of origin, gender identity, language, sexual orientation, disability status and other characteristics. Based on the assessment, the community characteristics that were thought to have the greatest impact on health status and access to care in the BIDMC CBSA were issues related to age, race/ethnicity, language, gender identity, immigration status, household composition, and economic security. There was consensus among interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants that people of color, recent immigrants, and non-English speakers were more likely to have poor health status and face systemic challenges accessing needed services than white, English speakers who were born in the United States. These segments of the population are impacted by language and cultural barriers that limit access to appropriate services, pose hea lth literacy challenges, exacerbate isolation, and may lea d to discrimination and disparities in access and health outcomes. One issue to be noted was the lack of data available by gend er identity and sexual orientation at the municipal or Commonwealth level.

Boston and Chelsea Race and Ethnicity In the BIDMC CBSA overall, the number of residents who identify as white and Black/African American decreased since 2010, while there was an increase in other census categories. Research illustrates the health disparities and differences in health care access and utilization that exist for diverse individuals and cohorts. T he percentage of Black/ African Americans who were uninsured was nearly double that of whites (10.6% vs. 5.9% white); Black/African Americans were also more likely to have reported fair or poor health compared to whites, and had the highest The percentage of the population under 18 years of age was significantly* lower in Boston (16%) and significantly* higher in Chelsea (25%) compared to the Commonwealth overall (20%).

Research shows that sustained success in community health improvement and addressing health disparities relies on addressing the social determinants of health that lead to poor health outcomes and drive health inequities. The assessment gathered a range of information related to housing, food insecurity, economic insecurity, education, access to care/navigation issues, and other important social factors.6 There was limited quantitative data in the area of social de terminants of health. Despite this, information gathered through interviews, focus groups, surveys, and listening sessions reinforced that these issues have th e greatest impact on health status and a ccess to care in the region - especially issues related to housing, food in security/nutrition , tr ansportation , and ec onomic stability. Interviewees, focus groups, and listening session participants shared that access to safe and affordable housing was a challenge for many residents. This was particularly true for those experiencing poverty and those living on an inadequate fixed income. Participants also noted that there were individuals who were homeless or unstably housed in the BIDMC CBSA, particularly in Boston.Interviewees, focus groups, and listening session par ticipant s identified food insecurity, h unger, a nd poor nutritio n as challenges , particularl y for individual s and families experiencing economic insecurity. These issues w ere largely driven by issues related to job loss, the inability to find employment that paid a livable wage, or living on an inadequate, fixed income, which impacted the ability of individuals and families to eat a healthy diet. In the suburban BIDMC CBSA municipalities, issues related to transportation were also identified as a critical barrier to maintaining one's health and accessing care, especially for those who do not have a personal vehicle or are without caregivers, family, and social support networks. Finally, those participating in interviews, focus groups, and community listening sessions identified issues related to violence, including community violence, domestic violence, and child abuse/neglect. Beyond the physical health impacts for survivors, research shows that there are short- and long-term health impacts for those exposed to violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. Research shows that the death of a child was associated with a 21% increased risk of ischemic heart disease among parents.7 Other social factors that were highlighted in a more limited way during the assessment and thought to have an impact on health status and access to care were educational attainment and the built environment, including the importance of safe streets, sidewalks, and recreational areas. Economic Stability Economic stability is affected by income/ poverty, financial resources, employment, and work environment, which allow people the ability to access the resources needed to lead a healthy life.8 Lower-than-average life expectancy is highly correlated with low-income status.9 Those who experience economic instability are more likely to be uninsured or to have health insurance coverage with li mited benefits. Research has show n that those who are uninsured or have limited health insurance benefits are less likely to access health care services.10 COVID-19 exacerbated many issues related to economic stability; individuals and communities were impacted by job loss and unemployment, leading to issues of financial ha rdship, food insecurity, and h ousing instability. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health conducted the COVID-19 Community Impact Survey in the fall of 2020 to assess emerging needs, results of which in dicated that community residents were concerned ab out their ability to pay their bills, especially in Boston, C helsea , and P eabody. 20 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Percent of Adults Reporting Income Loss During COVID-19, December 2020-January 2021 NOTE: Graphic produced by the Boston Public Health Commission; percentage of adults reporting their household had significant loss of employment income since COVID-19.

Issues related to food insecurity and hunger are also factors contributing to poor physical and mental health for both children and adults. While it is important to have grocery stores placed throughout a community to promote access, there are other factors that influence healthy eating, including quality and price of fruits and vegetables, marketing of unhealthy food and cultural appropriateness of food offerings. Food pantries and community meal programs have evolved from providing temporary or emergency food assistance to providing ongoing support for individuals, families, seniors living fixed incomes, and people living with disabilities and/or chronic health conditions. 22 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 American Asian Hispanic/Latino Source: US Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2016-2020Percentage of Residents 25 Years of Age and Older With a Bachelor's Degree or Higher, by Race/Ethnicity 2016-2020Education Research shows that those with more education live longer, healthier lives.12 Patients with higher level s of educational attainment can better understand their health needs, follow instructions, advocate for t he mselves and t heir families , and co mmunicate effectively with health providers.

Access to affordable and reliable transportation widens opportunity and is essential to addressing poverty and unemployment; it allows access to work, school, healthy foods, recreational facilities, and other community resources.Tran sportation Boston and Chelsea Transportation was identified as a barrier to care and services for some segments of the population that may have difficulty accessing public transportation, including older adults and individuals with physical disabilities. Chelsea focus group participants identified having access to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) buses as a resource and asset in their community. Other Municipalities in the BIDMC CBSA Many of the municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA have options for public transportation (e.g., buses, trains, commuter r ail) in and out of Boston and other surrounding communities. In all communities except Lexington (7%), Peabody (3%), and Burlington (4%), the percentage of residents who utilized public transportation to commute to work was significantly* higher compared to the Commonwealth (9%). Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants identified access to transportation as an issue in their community, especially for older adults without access to a personal vehicle or a caretaker. Source: US Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2016-2020 *Statistically significant, as determined by margin of error provided by the US Census Bureau. Built Environment Creating safe outdoor spaces for people to commute, exercise, and relax is an important component in establishing healthy lifestyle habits that protect against poor health outcomes. While concerns related to the built environment were not key themes emerging from BIDMC's assessment, these issues can work to either prevent or contribute t o disease and disability in the community. Boston and Chelsea Environmental health was identified as an American Rescue Plan Act priority area in the City of Chelsea. Strategies include increasing the amount of open space, parks, and active outdoor spaces, increasing street cleaning and sanitation, planting more trees, and developing a bike path to connect Chelsea to Boston. Crime and Violence Crime and violence, including domestic violence and intimate partner violence, are public health issues that influence health status on many levels, from death and injury to emotional trauma, anxiety, isolation, and absence of community cohesion. Boston and Chelsea In a focus group with individuals affected by violence and incarceration, participants shared the deep impacts and trauma imprinted on the community. Participants reported that there was a lack of empathy and support for communities and families, and expressed need for mental health support, peer programs, and more community organizations that focused on restorative justice, youth engagement, and mental health. 51 % of Chelsea residents who responded to the North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative Community S urvey chose \"lower crime and violence\" as one of the top five things they'd like to improve in their community. \"We have the resources within us - supportive peer groups [should be] set up so that the community can be the resources.\" -BIDMC focus group participantOther Municipalities in the BIDMC CBSA Crime and violence were not critical concerns in any of the other municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA. Violent crime counts (e.g., aggravated assault) were low in all communities. Property crime counts (e.g., burglary, arson, larceny) were also low .Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 25Systemic Factors In the context of the healthcare system, systemic factors include a br o ad range of different considerations that influence a person's ability to access timely, equitable, accessible, a nd high-quality services. There is a growing appreciat ion for the importance of these factors as they are seen a s critical to ensuring that people can find, access, and engage in the services they need, communicat e with clinical and social service providers, and transiti on seamlessly from one service setting to another. T he assessment g ather ed information r elated to p erceptions of service gaps, barriers to access (e.g., cost of care, health insurance status, language access, cultural com petence), care coordination, and information sharing. The assessment also explored issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and the impacts of racism and discrimi nat ion. Systemic barriers affect all segments of the population but have particularly significant impacts on people of color, non-Engl ish speakers, rec ent immigrants, individuals with d isabilities, older adults, those wh o are uninsured, and thos e who identify as LGBTQIA+. Findings from the assessment high lighted the challenges that residents throughou t the BIDMC CBSA fa ced with respect to long wait times, provider shortage s, and service gaps which impacted peo ple's ability to a ccess services in a timely manner. Thi s was particularly true with respec t to primary care, behavioral health, medical specialty care, and dental care se rvices. Interviewees, foc us groups, and listen ing session participants reflec ted on linguistic and cultural barrier s to care. The assessme nt findings reinforced how difficult it was for many residents to schedule appoin tments, coordinate care, an d find the services they needed, especially for indi viduals who speak la nguages other th an English. Participan ts discussed the n eed for tools to address these issues , such as resource inventories, ca se managers, recovery c oaches, and health care navigators. Racial Equity Racial equity is the condition where one's racial identity has no influence on how one fares in society.16 Racism and discrimination influence the social, economic, and physical environments \"The inequities that have been impacting Black and Brown people are still happening today, over 18 months later [after the death of George Floyd]. We have corporations and government and city officials talking about these disparities in health access, in food, and in access to affordable and safe places to live.\" -BIDMC intervieweeof Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), resulting in poorer social and physical conditions in those communities today.1 7 Race and racial health differences are not biological in nature. However, generations of i nequity contribute to differential health outcomes because of structur al barriers and unequal distribution of r esources. Boston and Chelsea Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants recognized the need for healthcare and community services that address racism, discrimination, and disparities in health access and outcomes. These disparities were further exposed by COVID-19, which disproportionately impacted communities of color. Experiencing racism and discrimination contributes to trauma, chronic stress and mental health issues that ultimately impact health outcomes. 28% of Boston adults reported that they have received poor service at restaurants or stores in their day-to-day life due to their race and/or ethnicity. Compared to white residents (15%), percentages were significantly higher among Black (46%), Latino (38%), and Asian (35%) residents. Source: BPHC Boston BRFSS COVID-19 Health Equity Questionnaire Other Municipalities in the BIDMC CBSA Racism and discrimination were recognized as critical community health issues in other BIDMC CBSA communities. Interviewees and focus groups identified the increasing diversity in their community as a critical strength.26 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Accessing and Navigating the Health Care System Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants identified a number of barriers to accessing and navigating the health care system. Many of these barriers were at the system level, meaning that the issues stemmed from the way in which the system did or did not function. System-level issues included providers not accepting new patients, long wait lists, and an inherently complicated healthcare system that was difficult for many to navigate. There were als o individual leve l b arriers to access and n avigation. Individuals may be uninsured or underinsured, w hich may lead them t o f orego or delay care. Individuals ma y a lso experience language or cultural barriers - research shows that these barriers contribute to health disparities, mistrust between providers and patients, ineffective communication, and i ssues of patient safety.18 Some providers began offering care via telehealth over the course of the pandemic to mitigate COVID-19 exposure and retain continuity of care. This strategy removed barriers for some but created new hardships for those who lacked technical resources or technical savvy to take advantage of such programs.19 3%4% 2%3%6% 1% 1% 1%3% 2016-2020Percentage of Indi viduals Who Were Uninsured, 2 016-2020Boston and Che lsea Compared to the Commonwealth (3%), the percentage of indiv i duals who were uninsured was higher in Boston (4%) a nd Chelsea (6%). Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants identified a need for more diverse health care providers; research shows that patients experience fewer barriers to care when doctors reflect their own race or ethnicity. Interviewees and focus groups also reported immigration st atu s as a barrier to care - research shows that immig rants are more likely to forego needed health care and so cial services due to fear and uncertainty. Othe r Municipalities in the BIDMC CBSA Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants reported that many residents found it difficult to navigate a complex healthcare system, including primary care, the behavioral health care system, health insurance, and specialty care. COVID-19 exacerbated barriers for many; wait times for appointments increased, and many providers stopped taking new patients. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 27Behavioral Factors The natio n , including the residents of Massachusetts and BIDMC's CB SA, face a health crisis due to the increasing burden of chr onic medical conditions. Underlying these health condit ions are a series of behavioral risk factors that are kno wn to help prevent illness and are the early signs or cont ributors of the leading causes of death (e.g., heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes). According to the Nat ional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading behavioral risk factors include an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco, alcohol, and mariju ana u se. Engaging in healthy behaviors and limiting the impacts of these risk factors is known to improve overall health status and well-being, and reduces the risk of illness and death due to the chronic conditions mentioned previously.20 When considering behavioral factors, the assessment reflected on a range of mostly quantitative information rel ated to nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use. Those who participated in the assessment's community engagement activities were asked to id entify the health issues that they felt were most important. While these issues wer e ultimately not selected during BIDMC's prioritizatio n process, the information from the assessment supports the importance of incorporating these issues i n BIDMC's IS. Nutrition Adults who eat a healthy diet have increased life expectancy and decreased risk of chronic diseases and obesity; children require a healthy diet to grow and develop properly.21 Access to affordable healthy foods is essential to a healthy diet. A cces s to opportunities for physical activity was not identified as a significant nee d in t he BIDMC CBSA, though there wa s recognition that lack of physical fitness is a leading risk factor for obesity and several chronic health conditions. Alcohol, Marijuana, and Tobacco Use Though legal in the Commonwealth for those aged 21 and older, long-term and excessive use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco can lead to the development and exacerbation of chronic and complex conditions, including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Clinical service providers engaged in the assessment reported that increased stress and isolation over the course of the pandemic led to increases in substance use and relapse.

These conditions include chronic and comm unicable medical conditions as well as mental hea lth and substance use disorders. As discussed in the i ntroductory sections of this report, the assessment gathered quantitative data to assess the extent that these issues were a concern in BIDMC's CBSA. T o aug ment and clarify this information, the assessment efforts included community engagement activities and specific requests for participants to reflect on the issues that they felt had the greatest impacts on co m munity health. Efforts were made to ensure t ha t participants reflected on a broad range of issues, i ncluding chronic and communicable medical conditions and behav ioral health issues. Given the limitations of quantitative data, specifically that it was often old data and was not stratified by race and ethnicity, the qualitative information from interviews, focus groups, and community listening sessions was of critical importance. Mental Health Anxiety, chronic stress, depression, and social isolation were leading community health concerns. There were specific concerns about the impact of mental health issues for youth and young adults; the mental health impacts of racism, discrimination, and trauma; and social isolation among older adults. These difficulties were exacerbated by COVID-19. In addition to the overall burden and prevalence of mental health issues, residents identified a need for more providers and treatment options, especially inpatient and outpatient treatment, child psychiatrists, peer support groups, and mental health services. Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants also reflected on mental health stigma and the shame and isolation that those with mental health challenges face on a day-to-day basis that limits their ability to access care and cope with their illness. Youth mental health was a concern in the BIDMC CBSA, including the prevalence of chronic stress, anxiety, and behavioral issues. These conditions were exacerbated throughout the pandemic, because of isolation, uncertainty, remote learning, and family dynamics. \"We need mo re mental health services that are not rooted in the white dominant cultu re, bu t that are rooted in people's cultu ral experiences.\" -BIDMC i ntervieweeBoston and Chelsea The rate of inpatient discharges for individuals under 18 ye ars of age for mental health conditions was higher than th e state in both Boston and Chelsea - the rate in Chelsea was nearly double that of the Commonwealth. 17% of Boston adults reported persistent sadness during the pandemic, and almost 22% reported persistent anxiety.

Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants reported high prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, and social isolat ion among older adults. In all communities except Lexington and Needham, more than 20% of respondents to the MDPH COVID-19 Commu nity Impact Survey reported poor mental health for at least 15 of the past 30 days. 35% Boston Community Impact Survey, Fall 2020 Substance Use Substance use continued to have major impacts on the BIDMC CBSA; the opioid epidemic continued to be an area of focus and concern, and there was recognition of the links and impacts on other community health priorities, including mental health, housing, and homelessness. I nterviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants identified s tigma as a barrier to treatment and reported a need for programs that address common co-occurring issues (e.g., mental h ealth i ssues, homelessness). Boston and Chelsea Interviewees, focus groups, and community listening session participants identified a need for more supportive se rvices for individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders, including mental health services, transitional housing, s upport f or employment a nd workforce d ev elopment. In both Boston and Chelsea, the most common substance of use among those admitted to DPH-funded treatment cen ters was heroin, followed by alcohol.

By analyzing assessment data, hospitals can identify the health issues that are particularly problematic and rank these issues in order of priority. This data can also be used to identify the segments of the community that are faced with health-related disparities or are disproportionately impacted by systemic racism or other forms of discrimination. Accordingly, using an interactive, anonymous polling software, BIDMC's CBAC and community residents, through the community listening sessions, formally prioritized the community health issues and cohorts that they believed should be the focus of BIDMC's IS. This prioritization process helps to ensure that BIDMC maximizes the impact of its community benefits resources and its efforts to improve health status, address disparities in health outcomes, and promote health equity. The process of identifying BIDMC's community health issues and prioritized cohorts is also informed by a review and careful reflection on the Commonwealth's priorities set by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Determination of Need process and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office.

Over the next three years, the medical center will work with its community partners, with a focus on Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods in its CBSA, to develop and/or continue programming to improve well-being and create a healthy future for all individuals and families. In recognition of the health disparities that exist for certain segments of the population, in vestments and resources will focus on improving the health status of the following priority cohorts and community he alth priority areas. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment | 33BIDMC Community Health Needs Assessment: Priority Cohorts Youth Older Adults Racially, Ethnically and Linguistically Diverse Populations Families Affected by Violence and/or IncarcerationLow-Resourced Populations BIDMC Community Health Needs Assessment: Priority Areas Community Health Needs Not Prioritized by BIDMC It is important to note that there are community health needs that were identified by BIDMC's assessment that were not prioritized for investment or included in BIDMC's IS. Specifically, addressing the digital divide (i.e., promoting equitable access to the internet) and supporting education across the lifespan were identified as community needs but were not included in BIDMC's IS. While these issues are important, BIDMC's CBAC and senior leadership team decided that these issues were outside of the medical center's sphere of infl uence and investments in other areas were both more feasible and likely to have greater impact. As a result, BIDMC recognized that other public and private organizations in its CBSA, Boston, and the Commonwealth were better positioned to focus on these issues. BIDMC remains open and willing to work with community residents, other hospitals, and other public and private partners to address these issues, particularly as part of a broad, strong collaborative. Community Health Needs Addressed in BIDMC's IS The issues that were identified in the BIDMC CHNA and are addressed in the hospital IS are housing issues, food insecurity, transportation, environmental justice/climate, economic insecurity, community safety, workforce development, small businesses, build capacity of healthcare workforce, navigation of healthcare system, linguistic access barrier s, promotion/ awareness of SDOH resources, diversify provider workforce, cost and insurance barriers, more peer-led services, addressing mistrust in healthcare, youth mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, isolation, impacts of violence & trauma, education (for communities, and for providers on how to best reach and treat them), stigma, racism (individual and systemic), culturally appropriate/competent health and community services, homophobia and transphobia, lack of education around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), diversifying leadership, cross sector collaboration and responses, and linguistic access/barriers to community resources/services. LGBTQIA+ 34 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Strategy BIDMC's current 2020-2022 IS was developed in 2019 and addressed the priority areas identified by the 2019 CHNA. The 2022 CHNA provides new guidance and invaluable insight on the characteristics of the BIDMC's CBSA population, as well as the social determinants of health, barriers to accessing care, and leading health issues, which informed and allowed BIDMC to develop its 2023-2025 IS. Included below, organized by priority area, are the core elements of BIDMC's 2023-2025 IS. The IS is designed to address the underlying social determinants of health, barriers to accessing care, and promote health equity. The content addresses the leading community health priorities, including activities geared toward health education and wellness (primary prevention), identification, screening, referral (secondary prevention), and disease management and treatment (tertiary prevention) Below is a brief discussion of the resources that BIDMC will invest to address the priorities identified by the CBAC and BIDMC's senior leadership team. Following the discussion of resources are summaries of each of the selected priority areas and a listing of the goals that were established for each priority area Community Benefits Resources BIDMC expends substantial resources on its community benefits program to achieve the goals and objectives in IS. These resources are expended, according to its current IS, through direct and in-kind investments in programs or services operated by BIDMC and/or its partners to improve the health of those living in its CBSA, particularly in the neighborhoods in Boston that have been prioritized and Chelsea. Additionally, BIDMC works on its own or with its partners to leverage funds through public or private grants and other funding sources. Finally, BIDMC supports residents in its CBSA by providing \"charity\" care to individuals who are low-resourced or those who are unable to pay for care and services. Moving forward, BIDMC will continue to commit resources through the same array of direct, in-kind, leveraged, or \"charity\" care expenditures to carry out its community benefits mission. Recognizing that community benefits planning is ongoing and will change with continued community input, BIDMC's IS will evolve. Circumstances may change with new opportunities, requests from the community, community and public health emergencies, and other issues that may arise, which may require a change in the IS or the strategies documented within it. BIDMC is committed to assessing information and updating the plan as needed. The following are brief descriptions of each priority area, along with the goals established by BIDMC to respond to the CHNA findings and the prioritization and planning processes. Please refer to the Summary IS in Appendix E for more details. Summary Implementation Strategy EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE Goal: Provide equitable and comprehensive access to high-quality health care services including primary care and specialty care, as well as urgent and emerging care, particularly for those who face cultural, linguistic and economic barriers. Strategies to address the priority: Promote equitable care, health equity, health literacy, and cultural humility for patients across BIDMC and BILH's licensed and/or affiliated health centers, especially those who face cultural and linguistic barriers.

Strategies to address the priority: Support and implement evidence-based programs that increase access to high-quality and culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health and substance use services. Advocate for and support policies and programs that address mental health and substance use. Implement trauma-informed care (TIC) principles and other prevention strategies to improve care for all, especiallythose with a history of adversity. COMPLEX AND CHRONIC CONDITIONS Goal: Improve health outcomes and reduce disparities for individuals at-risk for or living with chronic and/or complex conditions and caregivers by enhancing access to screening, referral services, coordinated health and support services, medications, and other resources. Strategies to address the priority: Provide preventive health information, services, and support for those at risk for complex and/or chronic conditions and support evidence-based chronic disease treatment and self-management programs.36 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Evaluation of Impact of 2020-2022 Implementation Strategy As part of the assessment, BIDMC evaluated its current IS. This process allows the hospital to better understand the effectiveness of its community benefits programming and to identify which programs should or should not continue. Moving forward with the 2023-2025 IS, BIDMC and all BILH hospitals will review community benefit programs through an objective, consistent process using the BILH Program Evaluation and Assessment Tool. Created with Community Benefits staff across BILH hospitals, the tool scores each program using criteria focused on CHNA priority alignment, funding, impact, and equity to determine fit and inclusion in the IS. Since 2020, some of the programs that would normally be conducted in-person were postponed or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When possible, programs are delivered virtually to ensure that the community is able to receive services to improve their health and wellness. The medical center dedicated significant time and resources to respond to COVID-19 needs. Below is a high-level overview of activities that BIDMC implemented to respond to COVID-19: Testing: BIDMC deployed staff and worked with its licensed and/or affiliated community health centers and the hospital's Chelsea location to expand community testing access. Bowdoin Street Health Center (BSHC) and BIDHC-Chelsea reduced barriers to access by offering on-site interpretation,welcoming walk-ins, and not requiring a physician order. BIDMC supported the Community Care Alliance health centers by supporting testing, sharing BILH protocols,procedures, and guidelines in real-time, and providing clinical and other support (e.g., isolation housing for staff, food,low-literacy education materials, personal protective equipment (PPE), etc.) to the community. Food Access: BIDMC partnered with community health centers and community-based organizations to supply and distribute bothfresh and shelf-stable foods to families and individuals living in public housing in Boston. BSHC provided food boxes to residents in their community. BIDMC partnered with Charles River Community Health (CRCH) which provided households with food boxes anddistributed free dairy items to patients during a mobile market. BIDMC provided low-cost access of rice and beans to About Fresh (for staple item boxes for Boston residents) and low-cost meal boxes to City of Chelsea residents via BIDMC's partnership with Sodexo. City of Chelsea residents were given masks, hand-sanitizer, Social Determinant of Health screening and connection toresources and gift cards to their local grocery store. For the 2020-2022 IS process, BIDMC planned for a comprehensive strategy to address the prioritized health needs of th e CBSA as outlined in the 2019 CHNA report. These strategies included grantmaking, in-kind support, partnerships, in ternal hospital programming, and charity care. Below is a summary of accomplishments and outcomes for a selection of community benefits programs for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and 2021. BIDMC will continue to monitor efforts through FY 20 22 to determine i ts impact in improving the health of the community and inform the next IS.

Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) and [Hospital and any collaborators] are conducting a community health needs assessmen t and creating an implementation plan to address the prioritized needs iden tified. Fo r the firs t time, all 10 hospitals in the BILH system are conducting this needs assessment togeth er. Ou r hop e is that we will create a plan at the individual hospital level as well as th e system level that wil l span across th e hospitals. During this intervie w, we will be asking you about the strengths and challeng es of the community you work in and the population s that you wo rk with. W e also want to know what BILH should focus on as we think abou t addressing some of the issues in the community. The data we collect during the assessment is anal yzed, prioritized, and then used to create an Implementation Strategy. The Implementation Strategy outlines how the Hospital and System will address the identified priori ties in partnership with community organizations.

I'm going to review some information about the purpose and ground rules for the discussion, then we'll begin. We want to hear your thoughts about things that impact health in your community. The information we collect will be used by Beth Israel Lahey Health to create a report ab out community health. We will share the results with the community in the winter and identify ways that we can work together to improve health and wellbeing. The is used to put together a plan that outlines how the Hospital and System will address the iden tified priorities in partnership with community organizations. We want everyone to have the chance to share their experiences. Please allow those speaking to finish before sharing your own comments. To keep the conversation moving, I may steer the group t o specific topics. I may try to involve people who are not speaking up as much to share their opinions, especially if one or more people seem to be dominating the conversation. If I do this, it's to make sure everyone is included. We are here to ask questi ons, to listen, and to make sure you all have the chance to share your thoughts. We will keep your identity and what you share private. We would like you all to agree as a group to keep today's talk confidential as well. We will be taking notes during the focus group, but your names will not be linked with your responses. When we report the results of this assessment, no one will be able to know what you have said. We hope you'll feel free to speak openly and honestly. With your permission, we would like to audio record the focus group to help ensure that we took accurate notes. No one besides the project staff would have access to these recordings, and we would destroy them after the report is written. Does everyone agree with the audio recording? If all participants agree, you can record the Zoom. If one or more person does not agree or are hesitant, do not record the focus group. Does anyone have any questions before we begin? Section One: Community Perceptions 1.To get started, let's talk about what affects our health. When you think about your community, what are some of the things that help you to be healthy? 2.What are some of the things that make it hard for you, and your community members, to be healthy? 3.Based on what you have shared, it sounds like [name 3 -4 of the top factors that we brought up] impact health for you. Did I capture that correctly? If yes, move on to Section 2. If no, ask for clarification on key factors and come to consensus on the 3 -4 factors that will shape the rest of the conversation) Let's talk more deeply about these concepts. Section Two: Key FactorsIn this section, ask participants to go more in depth about the factors they brought up in the previous section. For example, if they brought up the lack of affor dable healthy foods, ask \"are healthy foods available to some people, if so who? And why do you think they are not available to everyone?\" For each issue they identified: Are these (things that keep you healthy) available to everyone or just a few group s of people? Why do you think they (things that make it hard to be healthy) exist? / Why is this a challenge? Section Three: Ideas and Recommendations 4.Ideas: Thinking about the issues we discussed today, what ideas do you have for ways hospitals can work with other groups or services to address these challenges? 1.Based on what you shared in the beginning about the things that keep you healthy, what of the things you mentioned would you like to see more of? 5.Priorities : What do you thin k should be the top 3 issues that Hospitals and community organizations should focus on to make your community healthier?Date: 11/16/21 Start Time: 6 pm End time: 7 pm Group Name and Location: BIDMC -YMCA Youth Advisors, Egleston Square (Virtual) Where are you from and what do you love about your neighborhood? oBrighton: Everything is within walking distance oDo rchester: Everything is within walking distance - nail salon, grocery store oRo xbury: Food oBack Bay: Safe and Beautiful Wh at keeps g Safe oHa ppiness oMi ndset oWo rking out oGo od appetite oGo od environment oGo od connections oBu ild up Wh at takes away from being healthy oDr ugs oSo cial media oStr ess oAn xiety oNe gative people oNo t enough access to educational resources oBei ng negative oFin ancial stability oNo t enough pression oHe alth conditions: Lupus (disease) oLo ng lasting friendships and relationships oNo t working together oAb use oMi ndset (on both sides) oBeh avior oPer ception Ar e things that make you healthy available to everyone or certain groups?

When you think about your community, what are some of the things that help you to be healthy ? 2.What are some of the things that make it hard for you, and your community members, to be healthy? Peopl e who are not vaccinated and don't wear masks - n obody comes out to speak to people in Spanish. Concerned people will get sick. There is no communication about the risk t hat is out there - e specially the kids say they won't need one, won't get sick. Laundromats. Food - s poiled or close t o being spoiled. Access to healthy safe food - m any nods. Forget to take care of ourselves as parents & grandparents. Especially through the pandemic. When it comes to ourselves we don't take care of ourselves. Masks - w ork at a Food Bank and they keep forgetting to put them on or pull up; get offended. At the end of the night I'm exhausted. Little things to feel healthy safe and wise and get up the next day to do it again. Food, Environment, & Health - y oga and meditation are healing. 100 autoimmune diseases. 75% women carry. How it connects to stress, loss, diet, environment - chemical exposures (low & high such as diesel). They hav e an impact on all our major organs. My sisters and brothers aren't doing well even though it seems like we're doing well. Mothers and families struggling with mental health, loss of loved ones, not knowing where to go with our health. Trauma - everyday trauma. Youth and mental health - w hen our kids walk to school they walk by memorials of youth that got killed, candles, liquor bottles... Ther e were nurses and counselors when I went to school, but they [don't have that] they have to go in and just focus on work. There are drug dealers and they ar e afraid. They didn't talk to the kids about COVID when they returned to school. They have PTSD. They just throw my family in without dealing with the issues including what happened during the pandemic. It is trauma, after trauma - including for me. When I drive the bus. Other communities the kids have access t o such great schools, sports fields [it's hard to see]. A lot of littering. Grandson was shot at Dudley St. Park. Was in the hospital and they moved him. Has depression. Called the nurse and said he couldn't breathe. Told him not to bother her and she didn't take the time to assess his stress and pain. He discharged himself - l eft the hospital and now his brain is affected. Was a goodkid-not in trouble. Mother is stressed caring for siblings. DIdn't give him a wheelchair or pain medicine. In pain crying in the bed. How do we get help? COVID and how to make our way through it - The Health Dept has not gi ven accur ate information out there adequately. A lot of people are not wearing the mask - since were told didn't have to because had the vaccination. They think it is the unvaccinated. People are dying who were vaccinated. Where is the reality shared that whether you are vaccinated or not you are at risk? May even be hi gher risk because you don't realize it is in your body and you are spreading it. She is treated as an outsider having had COVID. It's upside down what is happening in the community and the health system is playing a huge role. Survivor - both sons shot and killed. What's helped has been being eng aged w ith different organizations that tal ked about harm , going to prison and doi ng r estorative justice. Being able to deal with my mental health. All those who hav e l ost children to violence it is a horrible impact. This time of year can be a c hallenge (birthdays, gloom, dates when were died). Having sisters to reach out to. Always somebody being shot in the community. Policy reform needed on cutting off benefits: People are so mean - can't say anything to anyone. Still depressed, have PTSD. Social Security just said that they will stop my disability. Had said could work, but now can't work 20 hours andget paid. If I didn't work, I'd lose my sanity thinking about my son who was killed.Try to talk to the youth. Kids aren't raised to respect people. 3.Based on what you have shared, it sounds like [name 3-4 of the top factors that we brought up] impact health for you. Did I capture that correctly? 1.Mental health 2.COVID 3.Environment (stress of chemical exposures/trash) 4.Support & servic es - especially peer support and Improved healthcare quality - equity I deas and Recommendations 1. Ideas: Thinking about the issues we discussed today, what ideas do you have for ways hospitals can work with other groups or services to address these challenges ? a.Based on what you shared in the beginning about the things that keep yo u heal thy, what of the things you mentioned would you like to see more of ? Social/emotional programming. Adolescent growth development (9 -20 y ears old) need to deal with autonomy, peer pressure... and need to deal with external anxieties. Need to understand the central nervous system and learn ways to control anxiety, self -regulation, calm the body down. Sports, arts, yoga - intentional programs to understand their bodies early in life and manage social emotional anxieties.Having a healthy routine - exercise, food, financial resources is a challenge. Have Multiple Sclerosis - hard to keep the routine going but it is so important. Trauma and mental health - what are the resources, including for grief from sudden loss. Those that have slipped into a deep depression. Need more information and resources. Goddaughter lost her 25 yr old daughter.Has separated herself from everyone including her mother. Drinking. Wouldn't answer her phone. What can support her? Need to support the children - service s as parents are consumed by their own grief. Teachers don't understand that they are acting up because they have internalized the trauma. Send them to another school Othersagree. Pockets of communities - Have small community centers for after school - all was taken away due to COVID. Mental illness, trauma, violence, all started. We did a good job as parents but they did not give usany resources on COVID, teaching them about how to protectthemselves. Runs a community center. They need to bring those resources back in the community. Mother whose son just got life in prison -couldn't find help. Community centers are overstressed. We need to find a way to come together to build our community up together again. We are strong, brilliant, and have what it takes but they aren't giving us what weneed. We have the resources within us - peer groups set up so the community can be the resource. Hands on people don't get the resources, theorganizations that come in and take the credit and don't do anything theyget the resources. My house was traumatized by COVID - nobody has asked us what we need now that almost lost her. Couldn't visit her mother in hospital because she had COVID Need to have a first aid kit at home, teach CPR. We can do this but need to bring these resources together - even if on a group zoom. It just takes ten of us to come together and save our children. We fed 2,700 families today. I have mental health issues you just don't see. I was hungry too. Beautiful people. Missing the hugs and facial sharing of feelings. Mental health and a drug addiction and then COVID changed everything.Lost father to COVID - he had mental health [challenges] & drug addiction, drinking. Was always at methadone mile - a person needs to want it. Children are having to take care of their parents [parent]. Peer work - BayCOVE key facilitator, will bring down. In our Own Voice Presenter for NAMI Mass. MS peer to peer. Sister Circle Peer Consultant. 2.Priorities : What do you think should be the top 3 issues that Hospitals and community organizations should focus on to make your community healthier? Supported in how to support the community - community-d riven, peer supports.Don't need money: I need all my AA sisters to give me that back rub, shake me, tell me everything will be alright. Support group for ourselves. We can't connect after the Zoom. Get the laughter bac k. Play cards & play bingo. After traumas nobody helped. DO NEED MONEY - M ost impoverished community in the c ity. Our work has been taken away due to COVID. It's huge - T he inequities. Should be focused on. We are Better Together - s upporting c riminally-i nvolved children and those who have lost their c hildren to violence. [Co-f acilitator] will bring it to people who will bring results. Need economic & social s ystems to get out of the way. Health. Mom's peer group. It wasn't the doctors. Acti onable Recommendations Developed by JSI Based on Themes Alert all h ealthcare staff that poor treatment of people of color has been reported leading to poor health outcomes and provide opportunities for training on equity and culturally - responsive care. Disseminate updated COVID -19 guidance for every healthcare visit (such as masks and social distance are vital as rates of highly contagious and dangerous strains are increasing across all age groups). Offer post -discharge supports to ensure strong individual and family recovery from serious COVID -19 cases. Work with school health to offer updated COVID- 19 messaging tailored to youth. Include resources to help youth with the impact of COVID -19 on their lives. Recommend that schools look for signs of COVID -related impacts and trauma/PTSD in youth (discourage suspensions in lieu of restorative justice and mental and social supports). Assist schools in creating content for COVID -19 lessons. Establish/strengthen peer support networks & programs within neighborhoods. Engage residents in activities for their communities that they can feel positive about contributing towards. Increase mental health offerings & awareness of mental health/SUD services.Date: 11/15 /21 Start Time: 5 pm End time: 6 pm Group Name and Location: Cantonese -speaking immigrants (Virtual) Section One: Community Perceptions 1.To get started, let's talk about what affects our health. When you think about your community, what are some of the things that help you to be healthy? Environment and hygiene e.g. Do more promotion about public health, for example encouraging people to take the booster shot. So if more people take the booster shot, people around them will feel safer. Public Safety Good public safety will allow me to feel assured/have a peace of mind. Housing Giving individual families their own housing will allow them to feel healthy. A lot of people in Chinatown currently share an apartment with several families because rent is too expensive. Community Centers Having the Golden Age Center improved my health a lot. The center would let us know/send us current updates and information, and they host different activities for seniors. This really helps with seniors' health. Good job opportunities Jobs with good wages that protect the working class. 2.What are some of the things that make it hard for you, and your community members, to be healthy? Housing As mentioned above, some families in Chinatown share the same apartment with other families. This hurts their mental health. Some students also share an apartment together with 7-8 other people. Homeless population There are too many homeless people around the Boston area. There seems to be even more homeless people after COVID. The homeless people makes me scared. Marijuana Too many people are smoking weed. We can always smell weed at home and on the streets. The smell of weed makes me feel unwell and unsafe. Trash around Chinatown The trash cans are always overflowing, no one cleans them up. The smell is awful, and people start littering everywhere. Food prices went up Wages are similar, but food prices have gone up a lot. Air and noise pollutionChinatown is situated right next to the 90 and 93 highway. The air pollution is really bad and it negatively affects our health. It is also really noisy. People don't want to op en their windows. 3.Based on what you have shared, it sounds like [name 3 -4 of the top factors that we brought up] impact health for you. Did I capture that correctly? Housing Public Safety Hygiene Let's talk more deeply about these concepts. Section Two: K ey Factors In this section, ask participants to go more in depth about the factors they brought up in the previous section. For example, if they brought up the lack of affordable healthy foods, ask \"are healthy foods available to some people, if so who? A nd why do you think they are not available to everyone?\" For each issue they identified: Housing Only available to a few groups of people - the wait time is very long A lot of affordable housing and elderly housing have been built in the 70s and 80s, but they didn't build much after that. But now they build a lot of luxury housing. Now there are a lot of vacant luxury housing but regular people can't live there. However ones who need housing need to line up for a very long time. If luxury apartments are going to be built, the government should also build more affordable housing so more people can be benefitted. This will affect people's mental health People will feel very mentally stressed. They will always worry whether they have money to pay next month's rent. It is hard for families with young kids to rent apartments. Landlords will reject you. There are more and more high-rises. There are more exhaust and CO2 coming from these buildings and it negatively impacts others. The air quality has deteriorated a lot in the last decade. Hygiene Only available to a few groups of people - the streets in Chinatown are very dirtyThis is because the people are not disciplined, and there is lack of regulating/ penalty. They should legislate to prevent people from throwing trash everywhere. Once the streets are dirty, there will be a lot of cockroaches and rats. A lot of them near Oxford Street. People who go through the trash would tear open the plastic bags and don't tie it back properly. They should issue penalties for littering or tying trash bags improperly. There aren't enough trashcans and recycle bins in Chinatown. We need more promotion/education in both English and Chinese, and more trash cans. Public Safety A lot of people are smoking weed and this negatively affects our public safety. The smell of weed makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. If the aroma is too strong, it makes me dizzy and my throat hurt/cough. Once I smell it I want to vomit. The government should designate specific spots for people to smoke weed Section Three: Ideas and Recommendations 1.Ideas: Thinking about the issues we discussed today, what ideas do you have for ways hospitals can work with other groups or services to address these challenges? a.Based on what you shared in the beginning about the things that keep you healthy, what of the things you mentioned would you like to see more of? Provide more bilingual (Chinese and English) information and updates, news, workshops, events to promote different programs and social events/happenings. Hospitals should provide a direct Chinese phone line, instead of requesting Cantonese/ Mandarin at the answering machine and wait for multiple transfers. Hospitals can purchase vacant properties and rent it out to patients who need affordable housing. Hospitals can provide bilingual social workers to help people fill out forms etc. 2.Priorities : What do you think should be the top 3 issues that Hospitals and community organizations should focu s on to make your community healthier? Bilingual community updates/promotion Make more health -related visual and graphic flyers for the community Host more talks and lecturesBeth Israel Lahey Health Community Health Assessment Focus Group Interviews Date: 12/6/21 Start Time: 6p End time: 7:30p Group Name and Location: Spanish speaking essential workers (virtual) Section 1: Community Perceptions What does it mean to be healthy? -Physical activity (1)1 -Eating well, eating vegetables (1)1.1 -Eating nutritious foods -Sometimes our culture focuses too much on carbs -Sugar is so low when i arrived to this country.

We need to focus not only on our p hysical but also mentally Nutritious foods are incredibly EXPENSIVE 1.1.1 Dental health is incredibly expensive Based on what you have shared, it sounds like [name 3- 4 of the top factors that we brought up] impact health for you. Did I capture that correctly? If yes, move on to Section 2. If no, ask for clarification on key factors and come to consensus on the 3- 4 factors that will shape the rest of the conversation) Let's talk more deeply about these concepts. Top Factors 1.Access to nutritious food 2.Invest in the healthcare system 3.Mental health services in the community Section 2: Exploring Key Factors In this section, ask participants to go more in depth about the factors they brought up in the previous section. Are these (things that keep you healthy) available to everyone or just a few groups of people? Why do you think they (things that make it hard to be healthy) exist? -Why is this a challenge? Not Asked What are some examples of how these challenges impact someone's health?

FACILITATION TRAINING Best Practices on Inclusive Facilitation October 07, 2021 Virtual Room AGENDA What is facilitation? Inclusive facilitation Creating inclusive space Characteristics of a good facilitator Let's practice! WHAT IS FACILITATION? Facilitation is a dance, an artform.INCLUSIVE FACILITATION Depending on the size of the group, ask participants to share their name, pronouns, and in one word describe how they're feeling today. Provide space and identify ways participants can engage at the start of the meeting Normalize silence. It's okay if folks are quiet, don't interpret as non-participation. Encourage people to take the time to reflect on the information presented to them. Dedicate time for personal reflection Create common ground. This helps with addressing power dynamics that may be present in the space. Establish community agreements inclusive means including everyone We shouldn't assume everyone feels comfortable enabling their video. Make this an option as opposed to a request. Identify ways to make people feel welcomed Support visual learners with a slideshow or other images. Real-time note-taking or tools that allow people to see how information is being processed and documented help each person stay engaged in the conversation. Design for different learning and processing styles Some folks may join through the dial in number, so consider walking through your agenda as if you were only on the phone. Consider language interpretation and closed captioning services. Consider accessibilityCREATING INCLUSIVE SPACE move at the speed of trustCHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD FACILITATOR Impartial Active listener PatientAuthentic EnthusiasticA participant seems to dominate the conversation.1 A participant has a lot of experience in the topic but is too shy to share them in a group setting. 2 A participant is talking about something not related to the topic of discussion. 3LET'S CONSIDER THE FOLLOWINGTHANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION!

Next Ba ck Done First Name and Email or Phone: Email: 1 Survey Distribution Channels: Global View Communications Engaging with Diverse Communities Survey Campaign Dates: November 1, 2021 - November 15, 2021. Connecting with our diverse communities to understand and address the most pressing health-r elated concerns for residents is priority for BILH. GVC have deployed a marketing campaign to reach our target populations through a three-p hase approach. First is an online survey which is followed by a listening session and then an annual meeting. Our Approach Research was conducted to determine the diverse target audiences based on zip codes surrounding our 10 hospitals and then cross-r eferenced with the top 2-t o-3 diverse populations and l anguages based on the largest cohorts. That research indicated the following audiences: Hispanic, Black/African American, Chinese, Haitian, Indian, and Cape Verdean. Winchester Hospital Beverly/ Addison Gilbert Hospital Lahey Hospital and Medical Center Anna Jaques Hospital Beth Hospital New England Baptist BID - Milton Hospital BID - Needham Hospital BID - Plymouth utilized three types of marketing channels to expand our reach. Diverse print publications, precision audio , and digital advertising. 1.Print The following print publications were selected based on reach or hyper targe ted audiences. Translation was used if the publication publishes in languages other than English. A.El Mundo - Spanish Translation B.Sampan - Chinese Translation C.Thang Long - Vietnamese TranslationD.Bay State Banner - Black/African American, Cape Verdean/English E.Chelsea Record - Hispanic/English F.Indian New England - English (online only) G.Haitian Reporter - English (online only) 3 For the printed newspapers the publish dates are as follows: Bay State 4-Nov El Mundo 4-Nov Sampan 5-Nov Haitian Report (digital only) 2 weeks Thang Long 2-Nov India New England (digital only) 2 weeks Chelsea 4-Nov 2.Digit al Advertising Digital ads will be served across various websites. GVC utilize d a people -based marketing approach. The digital ads will be served up based on the zip codes provided and will include both English and translation s based on user preferences. For social media and audio these ads run for a full 2 weeks from Nov 1 through Nov 15. A.African American/Black,Haitian, Cape VerdeanB.Hispanic C.Chinese D.Indian E.Vietnamese 4 C. Precision Audio GVC streamed :3 0 audio spot s across m ultiple platforms (iHeart, N PF, PODcasts, Pandora, Spotify, etc.). GVC serve d up au dio commerc ial voiceover fo r each h ospital using z ip codes. Fo r social media and a udio t hese a ds run for a f ull 2 w eeks f rom N ov 1 through N ov 1 5. Sample audio script. N ote: Script was customized for each of the 10 hospitals. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center wants to he ar what you think the most important health-re lated priorities are i n our community. Please take an online survey at bilh.org/chna. Your responses will he lp to inform innovative solutions to improve the health of our community. Simply go to bilh.org/chna and fill out the survey. That's b-i-l-h. org/c-h-n-a. Note: For social media and precision audio, this campaign is people based, so GVC is following each audience member and serving ad messaging where ever and whenever they are consuming online content (within the set frequency for the campaign). For example, one person could be more active online early mornings - reading articles when he/she/they wake up; listening to streamed music while he/she/they commute - so GVC would then be sure to serve Mike his daily ad frequency during the times he is more active online, increasing the likelihood for click conversion with display ads - or in the case of audio, listening to the ad through to 100% completion. So basic ally going off of the targets media consumption.

The 2022 Boston CHNA builds on the 2019 CHNA and takes a deep dive into the key priority areas identified in the 2020 community health improvement plan: housing, financial stability and mobility, behavioral health, and accessing services. The 2022 CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented time, including the COVID - 19 pandemic and a reckoning with systemic racism. METHODS This CHNA focuses on the social determinants of health and is guided by a health equity lens. In the U.S., social, economic, and political proces ses work together to assign social status based on race and ethnicity, which may affect access to opportunities, such as educational and occupational mobility and housing options, each of which are intimately linked with health. Historical oppression, inst itutional racism, discriminatory policies, and economic inequality are several root factors that shape health inequities across the U.S. Existing secondary data were reviewed from national, state, and city sources, including datasets such as the American Community Survey, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BBRFSS), BBRFS S COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , and vital records, amo ng other sources. For new data collection, key informant interviews were conducted with 62 leaders across sectors and 29 focus groups were facilitated with 309 residents who have been particularly burdened by social, economic, language, and health challeng es. We use the term \"residents\" throughout the report to refer to participants in focus groups, interviews, and community listening sessions. Social Determinants of Health Framework Source: World Health Organization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. ii COMMUNITY ASSETS AND STRENGTHS Residents described their communities as deeply connected, resilient, committed to solving problems, and comprised of several supportive community - based organizations. Key informants and focus group participants talked about their communities as being vibrant, full of rich cultural traditions, having a strong hist ory of activism and art, intelligent, innovative, and committed to solving problems. OVERALL HEALTH AND MORTALITY Community Health Perceptions: Top of mind health concerns for focus group and interview participants were mental health, substance use, hear t disease, diabetes, asthma, and obesity, all of which they perceived as being harder to tackle during the pandemic. Leading Causes of Death : COVID -19 was the leading cause of death for Black, Latino, and Asian residents in Boston in 2020. Additional leading causes of death were chronic diseases and accidents . Leading Causes of Mortality, by Boston and Race/Ethnicity, Age -Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Residents, 2020 Boston Asian Black Latino White 1 COVID -19 138.4 COVID Heart Disease 183.6 Heart Disease 86.1 Heart Disease 113.1 3 Heart Disease 114.9 Heart Disease 55.4 Cancer 166.7 Cancer 78.8 COVID -19 103.5 4 Accidents 53.7 Cerebrovascular Diseases 22.2 Accidents 82.7 Accidents 59.5 Accidents 53.2 5 Cerebrovascular Diseases 27.4 Accidents 17.1 Cerebrovascular Diseases 52.8 Diabetes 27.4 Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases 24.7 DATA SOURCE: Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston Resident Deaths, 2020 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MOBILITY: Jobs, Employment, Income, Education, and Workforce Training Income and Poverty: Comm unity leaders and residents described financial stability as critical for health and shared that low -wage work and minimum wage is insufficient for many families to survive in Boston. Residents noted that the pandemic has worsened poverty for low-income residents across Boston. Based on the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, income loss during the pandemic has disproportionately affected residents of color and low -income residents. \"The community has come together for food distributions, to work together as a community to support the community with food access. There is always more to do , but this is a way that we have improved and supported each other.\" - Focus group participant iii Food Insecurity : Barriers to accessing healthy, affordable food em erged as a priority issue , which worsened during the pandemic and by the rising cost of food. According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , food insecurity is greatest among residents of color and adults with children at home. Employment : Interview and focus group participants described significant job loss linked with the pandemic and noted that finding and securing stable jobs is more difficult for residents of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, and residents with a criminal record. They also shared that low- wage workers, especially immigrants, worked in high -risk job settings during the pandemic . Education: Focus group and interview participants described remote learning and the pandemic as particularly hard for youth who already face disproportionate challenges in school. According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, 14.5% of Boston adults with children reported unme t educational needs for children or teens during the pandemic. HOUSING: Affordability, Quality, Homelessness, Homeownership, Gentrification, and Displacement Housing Affordability : Interview and focus group participants cited housing affordability as a dominant concern that has been exacerbated by the pandemic due to high housing costs and employment fluctuations . In the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, 41.5% of adults reported having trouble paying their rent or mortgage during t he pandemic, with highest proportions reported among residents of color and adults with children at home . Housing Instability and Transiency: Community leaders and residents described housing assistance as insufficient to meet the needs of low -income resid ents and expressed concern about ending rental assistance programs instituted during the pandemic . Residents underscored how the lack of affordable housing contributes to homelessness and housing instability, overcrowded housing, and housing displacement - which adversely affect mental health . Housing Conditions, Overcrowding, and COVID -19: Residents noted that COVID -19 cases often affected several household members, which they linked to dense living conditions that make it difficult to isolate or quarantine and people working multiple jobs outside of the home . 41.5% 52.1% * 36.3%Boston Asian Black Latino Other White At least one child in home No children in homePercent Adults Reporting Having Trouble Paying Their Rent or Mortgage During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Equity Quest ionnaire, December 2020 - January 2021 iv BEHAVIORAL HEALTH : Mental Health and Substance Use Trauma, Discrimination, and Racism: Residents discussed that some groups are disproportionately affected by trauma, discrimination, and racism, including: residents of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, sexual ( LGBTQ IA+) communities, veterans, people with disabilities, people who have experienced violence, low - income residents, and those who lost loved ones during the pandemic. In the 2015 -2019 BBRFS S, reports of being threatened at least a few times a mo nth due to discrimination were highest among Black and Latino residents. Community Violence and Interactions with Police : Some residents discussed community violence and safety concerns as well as increased neighborhood conversations about community and p olice relations. In 2015 -2019 , the most recent years for which data are available, BBRFS S respondents' reports of feeling like they were stopped by police due to their race or ethnicity were highest among residents of color. Mental Health, Depression, and Suicide : Mental health was a key issue pre -pandemic and the impact of the pandemic only heightened that concern , particularly for children, youth, and caregivers . According to the COVI D-19 Health Equity Survey , during the pandemic 16.8% of Boston adults reported experiencing persistent sadness and 21.9% reported persistent anxiety during the pandemic for more than half of the days in the past 2 weeks . Notably, 29.2% of LGBTQ IA+ Youth Ri sk Behavior Survey (YRBS ) student respondents reported having had suicidal thoughts in 2015 -2019. Behavioral and Mental Health Care Access and Barriers to Care : Residents discussed several barriers to accessing mental health care , including a limited number of mental health providers , financial barriers, a lack of culturally appropriate and linguistically congruent care , and stigma surrounding mental health care . Based on the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , 9.9% of Boston adults re ported delaying mental health care due to the pandemic and 7.1% reported delaying mental health care because of cost . Substance Use: Substance use concerns that emerged include misuse of drugs, overusing prescriptions and over -the-counter medicines, and sm oking nicotine and marijuana , particularly among LGBTQIA+ residents and youth. According to COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , 27.8% of Boston adults reported increased drinking habits during the pandemic. ACCESSING SERVICES: Childcare, Social Services, and Health Care Accessing Childcare Services: In focus groups and interviews , childcare emerged as a growing need due to the pandemic . According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , 14.3% of Boston adults reported that children in their households experienced unmet childcare needs during the pandemic. Accessing Social and Other Services : Residents and community leaders discussed rising and acute social and economic needs among a growing segment of low -incom e residents and significant barriers to accessing services, such as: transportation, difficulty navigating application processes, limited Internet, and lack of eligibility due to immigration status. Several participants also discussed systemic racism, raci al injustice, and discrimination. In 2015 -2019 BBRFS S data , 28.4% of Boston residents reported receiving poor service at restaurants or stores in day -to-day life due to their race or ethnicity , with a higher proportion of respondents of color indicating having this experience . \"The trauma also perpetuates these issues, and the environment also perpetuates these issues and systemically the services that we don't get perpetuates these issues. So that is why racism is a public health crisis.\" - Key informant intervi ew v Accessing Health Care Services : Residents identified barriers to accessing health care , includ ing: income , health insurance, distrust towards providers, difficulty navigating the health care system, transportation, difficulty securing a medical appointment, language barriers, and limited culturally relevant care. Residents described how r acial and ethnic inequities in health care access and social factors - such as transportation and Internet access - have been magnified by the COVID -19 pandemic. COMMUNITY'S VISION AND COMMUNITY SUGGESTIO NS FOR THE FUTURE Interview and focus group participants were asked for their suggestions for addressing identified needs and their vision for the future. Suggestions included the following: Deepen Partnerships with Local Communities and Collaborate to P romote Health Equity Focus on Dismantling Systemic Racism Create Opportunities that Foster Economic Stability and Mobility Improve Housing Affordability Improve Access to and Quality of Behavioral Health Care Strengthen Health Care Policies and Improve Hea lth Care Access and Quality Promote Child and Youth Development Create a Healthier Built and Physical Environment PRIORITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE ACTION For the past two years, the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative has been implementing the 70 strategies outlined in the 2020 community health improvement plan. Great progress has been made on many of these strategies, while other strategies have not been implem ented as extensively given constrained capacity and the current context of the COVID -19 pandemic. Given this backdrop, the 2022 prioritization process focused on: 1) reaffirming the previous priorities and identifying any new issues that have emerged; an d 2) prioritizing specific strategies within these major areas that should be lifted up for future action. In May -June 2022, 62 participants were engaged in four community listening sessions to discuss the CHNA findings, provide feedback on the data and key priority areas , and systematically vote on the 2020 CHIP strategies for more focused implementation. The results reaffirmed the CHIP's priorities of: Housing (including affordability, quality, homelessness, ownership, gentrification, and displacement) Financial Security and Mobility (including jobs, employment, income, education, and workforce training which comprised this priority in the past CHIP , and including food security which emerged as a salient issue in the 2022 CHNA ) Behavio ral Health (including mental health and substance use) Accessing Services (including health care, childcare and social services) \"Due to my language barriers, I was not able to express my health concerns and had a hard time to communicate with doctors to get right treatment.\" - Focus group participant 1 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment BACKGROUND This report is the 2022 community health needs assessment for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative. A community health needs assessment , or CHNA, gathers community input and data to gain a greater understanding of the strengths of th e community, the issues that residents face, how those issues are currently being addressed, and where there are gaps and opportunities to address these issues in the future. CHNAs provide a data -informed foundation for planning and the development of init Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative ( the Collaborative ) is a group of Boston community residents, community -based organizations, community development corporations, health centers, the hospitals , and the Boston Public Health Commission . This group has come together to achieve sustainable positive change in the health of the city by collaborating with communities, sharing knowledge, aligning resources, and addressing root causes of health inequities. One of the fundamental approaches for this work is to conduct a community health needs assessment so efforts are informed by data and community members themselves. While community health assessment and planning have been long - standing endeavors among organizations across the city, the Collaborative aims to leverage, align, and coordinate efforts and resources across multi -sector stakeholders in Boston . More details about the Collaborative's structure and engagement can be found in the Methods section of this report, Appendi ces A -C, and at http://www.bostonchna.org/ . Purpose and Context of the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment In 2019, the Collaborative conducted the first large -scale joint citywide CHNA which then guided the city's community health improvement plan (CHIP) , a blueprint describing how the Collaborative would focus on collectively addressing the key priorities. The 2022 Boston CHNA builds on those efforts by taking a deep dive into the key priority areas identified in the previous CHIP : housing, financial stability and mobility, behavioral health, and access ing services . This 2022 CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented time, including the COVID -19 pandemic , which exacerbated many social and economic inequalities that have been present for generations . The pandemic contributed to a staggering number of COVID -19 cases, deaths, and ongoing health challenges which disproportionately affected marginalized populations . During this same period, there has been a growing national movement calling for racial equity to address racial injustices in the U.S. The growth of this movement has been sparked by the killings of several Black Americans including George Floyd and Ahm aud Arbery . In 2020, the City of Boston declared racism as a public health crisis , underscoring the City's commitment to dismantle structural racism and recognize historical injustice . This context shaped the assessment approach and content , in that t he 2022 Boston CHNA also explores how the pandemic and racial injustices have affected priorities that emerged from the previous CHIP . 2 These processes have been guided by the Collaborative's sha red values of: Equity : Focus on inequities that affect health with an emphasis on race and ethnicity; Inclusion : Engage diverse communities and respect diverse viewpoints; Data driven : Be systematic in our process and employ evidence -informed strategies t o maximize impact; Innovative : Implement approaches that embrace continuous improvement, creativity, and change; Integrity : Carry out our work with transparency, responsibility, and accountability; Partnership : Build trusting and collaborative relationships between communities and organizations to foster sustainable, community -centered change. Definition of Community Served The 2022 Boston CHNA focused on the geographic area of the City of Boston. When available and appropriate, the data are presented for Boston overall and by different sub -populations. This includes by race/ethnicity, neighborhood, and other defining characteristics. METHO DS Social Determinants of Health Framework This CHNA focuses on the social determinants of health and is guided by a health equity lens (Figure 1). The contexts in which population groups live, learn, work , and play have a profound impact on health. There is often a deep connection between how race, ethnicity, income, geography , and other factors shape health patterns. In the U.S., social, economic, and political processes work together to assign social status based on race and ethnicity, which may affect access to opportunities, such as educational and occupational mobility and housing options, each of which are intimately linked with health. Historical oppression, i nstitutional racism, discriminatory policies, and economic inequalit y are several of the root factors that shape persistent and emerging health inequities across the U.S. Figure 1.

Review of Secondary Data The 2022 Bosto n CHNA data gathering effort included a review of existing secondary data on social, economic, and health indicators. These indicators provide insights into patterns across Boston, by Boston neighborhood, and by population groups within Boston. Secondary d ata sources included U.S. Census/American Community Survey, vital statistics (birth/death records), hospital case mix data, 3 Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BBRFS S), BBRFS S COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Addiction Services treatment data . The Secondary Data Work Group of the Collaborative included 16 members representing a range of organizations, including hospitals, health centers, and local public health . The Secondary Data Work Group's charge was to provide guidance on secondary data approach and indicators and foster connections with key networks and groups to provide relevant data (See Appendix B for list of members). To identify the list of social, economic, and health indicators, Secondary Data W ork Group members reviewed the indicator list from the 2019 Boston CHNA and prioritized which indic ators should be revisited for the 2022 report. The secondary data work group engaged in multiple discussions and prioritized the secondary data that aligned with the 2019 priority areas; that COVID -19 had a disproportionate impact on, and/or where there we re the greatest inequities by race/ethnicity, neighborhood, or other characteristics. Secondary data in the 2022 CHNA represent the most recent data available, and in several cases overlap with data included in the 2019 CHNA due to the need to combine data across years to look at patterns by neighborhood and social and demographic factors. Qualitative discussions (described in the section that follows) build upo n the secondary data by shedding light on residents' recent experiences with and perspectives on many factors , including the social determinants of health and how these issues have been affected by the COVID -19 pandemic . Additional detail on the secondary data approach can be found in Appendix D , while Appendix F presents numerous additional data tables and graphs beyond what is covered in the body of this report. Qualitative Discussions and Community Engagement The Community Engagement Work Group includes 24 members representing a range of organizations, including health centers, local public health, community development, community -based organizations , and hospitals . The Work Group's charge is to provide guidance on the approach to community engag ement, input on primary data collections methods, and support with logistics for primary data collection (See Append ix B for list of members). The Collaborative's Community Engagement Work Group led efforts to gain insight into community needs and strength s as well as priorities from community leaders and residents , especially among those where there has been a gap in representation in previous processes . Altogether, they facilitated 29 virtual and in -person focus group discussions with a total of 309 residents who have been disproportionately burdened by social, economic, and health challenges including: youth and adolescents, older adults, persons with disabilities, low -resourced individuals and families, LGBTQI A+ populations, racially /ethnically diverse populations (e.g., African American, Latino, Haitian, Cape Verdean, Vietnamese, Chinese ), limited -English speakers , immigrant and asylee communities, families affected by incarceration and/or violence, and veterans. Some focus groups we re conducted in languages other than English, including Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Please see Appendix D for more details on the community engagement process and qualitative data approach . Collaborative members conducted key informant interviews w ith 62 individuals. These represented a cross -section of sectors to identify areas of action and perspectives on the community. These interviewees included leaders and staff from public health, health care, behavioral health, the faith community, immigrant services, housing organizations, economic development, community 4 development, racial justice organizations, social service organizations, education, community coalitions, the business community, childcare centers, elected government offices, and others. Please see Appendix E for a list of key informant interviewee organizations. Additionally, Collaborative members conducted four 90-minute virtual Community Listening Sessions in January 2022. A total of 122 community members participated in these four sessions . These sessions occurred mid -way into the CHNA process and provided an opportunity to gather feedback and insights on preliminary data findings and potential priorities at this point in time . During these sessions, Collaborative mem bers shared preliminary themes from focus groups , interviews , and the review of secondary data . The participants discussed their reactions and feedback to these preliminary findings in small groups and identified areas that were their highest priority for action . To deepen understanding of issues that were salient to respondents, interview , focus group , and community listening session discussion guides used open -ended questions and did not ask about specific topics. Community engagement work group members and their partners conducted the focus groups and interviews , and then summarized the key themes from the discussions they facilitated. These summaries were then analyzed to identify common themes and sub -themes across population groups as well as unique challenges and perspectives identified by populations and sectors, with an emphasis on diving deep into the root causes of inequities. Frequency and intensity of discussions on a specific topic were key indicator s used for extracting main themes. Additional information on the qualitative data collection and analysis process can be found in Appendix D. We use the term \"residents\" throughout the report to refer to participants in focus groups, interviews, and commun ity listening sessions. Limitations While the data sources used in th is CHNA are highly credible, there are some important limitations and considerations that are important to keep in mind. Qualitative discussions use small sample sizes and non-random sam pling methods , the latter of which is an important approach to incorporating the perspectives of communities who were underrepresented in previous processes . Moreover, due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, Collaborative members conducted the majority of interviews and focus group discussions remotely, which may have affected participation - both in terms of who is able to participate remotely and the information elicited in remote discussions. Secondary data may have a time lag and apply different ways of measuring variable such as neighborhoods . Additionally, BBRFS S data from 2015 -2019 are the most recent data available regarding the experiences, health behaviors, and self-reported health and health care patterns among Boston residents. Given the need to aggregate data across years to look at patterns across neighbor hoods and population groups, data from the 2015 -2019 period overlap with data reported in the 2019 community health needs assessment. Finally, COVID -19 data provide a snapshot in one moment in time in the ongoing pandemic and are not representative of the entire pandemic. 2022 CHNA: A Snapshot in Time during the COVID -19 Pandemic The COVID -19 pandemic has been an important and evolving backdrop to the 2022 Boston CHNA , and thus shapes how the COVID -19 pandemic has affected priority areas identified in the 2019 CHNA . Despite access to vaccinations beginning in late 2020 and early 2021, there have been multiple increases in case rates linked with the onset of the Delta and Omicron variants. The COVID -19 pandemic is marked by significant changes and inequitie s in health, the economy, and the workforce . Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID -19 pandemic, i t is critical now , more than ever , to understand community needs, experiences, and opportunities for the future. 5 We also recognize how the pandemic has shaped this process. As part of the BBRFSS, a separate COVID - 19 Health Equity Survey was conducted by the Boston Public Health Commission to better understand experiences among residents who have been most impacted by the pandemic. This survey of a random sample of over 1,650 residents in multiple languages was conducted in December 2020/January 2021 and examined issues related to job loss, food insecurity, access to services, mental health, as well as COVID -19 risk perceptions, vaccination, an d information sources. Additionally, the COVID -19 pandemic affected the data collection methods as most of the focus groups and interviews occurred by telephone or video conference . Not surprisingly, the COVID -19 pandemic came up quite a bit during the d iscussions - but less about the disease itself, and more about how the pandemic has highlighted long -standing and existing inequities that have been pervasive in Boston and the U.S . For these reasons, findings should be understood as capturing a snapshot i n an unprecedented moment in time. BOSTON POPULATION - RACE, ETHNICITY, AND LANGUAGE Boston's population is incredibly diverse in terms of race and ethnicity, country of birth, and language use. While the racial and ethnic distribution across Boston has remained similar since the 20 19 CHNA, the racial and ethnic composition is changing across neighborhoods. Race and Ethnic Diversity Historic disinvestment in communities of color are the root causes of racial inequities in the social determinants of health.1 Racial and ethnic h ealth and health care inequities are persistent and are among the leading public health challenges of our time . For example, people of color experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID -19-related income loss, cases , and deaths , whereas White residents appeared to weather the COVID -19 pandemic with fewer social, economic, and health costs.2,3 Understanding the racial, ethnic, and language profiles of Boston residents provide s context to data about health status and the structural, discriminatory, and social factors that contribute to health inequities. Focus group participants and key informants discussed the racial diversity of residents across Boston as a unique strength, h ighlighting Black/African American, African, Latino, Cape Verdean, Haitian, Asian, and other Caribbean communities in the Boston area. According to Census estimates ( 6 Table 1), approximately 3 in 5 (60.0%) Boston residents identify as people of color . Mattapan, Hyde Park, Dorchester, and Roxbury are home to the largest proportion of Boston residents who identify as Black . East Boston , Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Dorchester's 02121 and 02125 zip codes have the largest percent of residents who identify as Latino , while Fenway and Allston/Brighton are home to the largest proportion of Asian residents . 7 Table 1. Raci al and Ethnic Distribution, by Boston and Neighborhood, 2 020 Asian Black Latino White Two or More Races Census of Population and Housing, 2020 NOTE: Neighborhoods as defined by Boston Public Health Commission; Back Bay includes Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, North E nd, and West End; South End includes South End and Chinatown; Latino includes residents who identify as Latino regardless of race and rac e categories may include residents who identify as Latino ; therefore, the percentages may not add up to 100% Language and Immigrant Communities A theme across several interviews and focus groups was that immigrant communities in the Boston area are hardworking, family - and community -oriented, willing to help others, eager to contribute socially and economically, and passionate about local issues and issues in their home countries. Several key informants and focus group participants observed that undocumented immigrants experienced additional barriers to housing, health insurance, and accessing resources and assistance programs, which they perceived were based on legal status and fear of deportation. Key in formants and focus group participants noted many languages spoken among residents, including Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Cape Verdean Creole, and indigenous languages. Some residents described free English classes as an important resource for residents for whom English is not their first language. However, l anguage barriers still emerged as an important issue affecting immigrant communities. \"I think [specific neighborhoods] are great for new immigrants. When you first come to the United States, you need help from others.\" -Focus group participant8 COMMUNITY ASSETS AND STRENGTHS Residents described the ir communit ies as deeply connected, resilient, committed to solving problems, and comprised of several supportive community -based organizations . Understanding the strengths of community members and community resources and services helps to identify the assets that can be drawn upon to promote community health and address any existing gaps. When asked about community strengths, r esidents discussed a strong sense of community among residents, especially those who have lived in neighborhoods for years. They described thei r neighbors as supporting each other even when they themselves have limited resources. Focus group participants described their neighbors as \"resilient\" and \"resourceful\" even under difficult circumstances. Key informants and focus group participants talke d about their communities as being vibrant, full of rich cultural traditions, having a strong history of activism and art, intelligent, innovative, and committed to solving problems. Focus group participants and key informants discussed the breadth of community -based institutions and services that they knew of, especially those focused on early childhood, youth, young men of color, food security, housing, mental health, health care, ca regiver support, workforce development, and the LGBTQIA+ population. Resource sharing and collaboration among a network of community - based organizations was also discussed as a strength. Residents described other community strengths, including engaged elec ted officials, educational opportunities and the school system, green space (e.g., parks), accessible libraries, and easy access to the transportation system. OVERALL HEALTH AND MORTALITY Top of mind health concerns for focus group and interview particip ants were mental health, substance use, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and obesity, all of which they perceived as being harder to tackle during the pandemic. Meanwhile , COVID -19 was the leading cause of death for Black, Latino, and Asian residents in Bo ston in 2020. Community Perceptions of Health Mental health, substance use, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and obesity were most frequently brought up as health concerns during interviews and focus group discussions. Key informants and focus \"The community has come together for food distributions, to work toge ther as a community to support the community with food access. There is always more to do , but this is a way that we have improved and supported each other.\" - Focus group participant 9 group participants also described a high case rate of COVID -19 for immigrant s and communities of color (e.g., Haitian, Cape Verdean, Latino) and for residents of color and low -wage workers who were not able to work from home . Other health concerns discussed by community leaders and residents included cancer, dementia, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, oral health, Black women's maternal health, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Some key informants and focus group participants underscored h ow pre- existing conditions have worsened during the COVID -19 pandemic, including chronic conditions that are difficult to manage, conditions that have remained undiagnosed, and chronic conditions linked with trauma. Youth and LGBTQIA+ focus group participa nts described sleep as critical to promoting health and identified stress and anxiety as barriers to living a healthy lifestyle and getting adequate sleep . Several focus group participants, particularly youth and residents in Chinatown, cited environmental quality as being linked with health, including air pollution, poor ventilation, smoke from tobacco and marijuana use, and lack of cleanliness in the neighborhood. Several focus group participants described physical activity, including going for a walk, playing sports, and working out, as important for feeling good, relieving stress, and overall health. Focus group participants explained that during the COVID -19 pandemic they have not been able to do as much physical activity and have been quite sedentary . As one participant mentioned, \"People have not been active through COVID - kids and adults have put on so much weight - some have become obese. I am worried about the kids - they don't get enough activity.\" Focus group participants cited the importance of and need for green space (e.g., parks, access to walking paths) to enable residents to spend time outside safely and to be physically active in an affordable way. Several focus group participants noted the importance of clean neighborhoods, including air quality and trash. LGBTQIA+ focus group participants also described a need for gyms that are more welcoming to LGBTQIA+ r esidents. Additional data on health issues such as asthma, birth outcomes, and physical activity can be found in Appendix F. Overall Mor tality In 2020, COVID -19 was the leading cause of death for Black, Latino, and Asian residents in Boston , whereas can cer was the leading cause of death for White residents ( \"It seems like almost every family has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.\" -Focus group participant 10 Table 2). Additional leading causes of death were accidents and chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular diseases. In the 2019 Boston CHNA, cancer was the leading cause of death across each of the largest racial and ethnic groups in Boston. 11 Table 2. Leading Causes of Mortality, by Boston and Race/Ethnicity, Age -Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Residents, 2020 Boston Asian Black Latino White 1 COVID -19 138.4 COVID Heart Disease 183.6 Heart Disease 86.1 Heart Disease 113.1 3 Heart Disease 114.9 Heart Disease 55.4 Cancer 166.7 Cancer 78.8 COVID -19 103.5 4 Accidents 53.7 Cerebrovascular Diseases 22.2 Accidents 82.7 Accidents 59.5 Accidents 53.2 5 Cerebrovascular Diseases 27.4 Accidents 17.1 Cerebrovascular Diseases 52.8 Diabetes 27.4 Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases 24.7 DATA SOURCE: Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston Resident Deaths, 2020 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Please be advised that 2020 -2022 data are preliminary and subject to change. Raw preliminary data may be incomplete or inaccurate, have not been fully verified, and revisions are likely to occur following the production of these data. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health strongly cautions users regarding the accuracy of statistical analyses ba sed on preliminary data and particularly with regard to small numbers of events ; Dagger () denotes where rates are based on 20 or fewer deaths and may be unstable Of note, the cancer mortality rate for each of Boston's largest racial and ethnic groups i n 2020 was lower than that reported in the 2019 community health needs assessment. During this same period, the heart disease mortality rate appeared to increase among Black residents, decrease for Asian and White residents, and remained relatively stable for Latino residents. Since the 2019 community health needs assessment, the accident -related mortality rate increased for Black and Latino residents, remained relative ly stable for White residents, and emerged as a leading cause of death for Asian residents. The rate of mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased for Black residents, remained stable for Asian residents, and did not emerge as the top five causes o f mortality for Latino and White residents, likely due to COVID -19 becoming a leading cause of death in 2020. The diabetes -related mortality rate remained stable for Latino residents since the 2019 community health needs assessment. (It should be noted tha t changes in mortality rates over time were not tested for statistically significant differences.) Premature mortality refers to deaths among persons under 65 years of age. The premature mortality rate in 2020 -2021 was highest among Black and Latino resid ents ( 12 Figure 2). Of note, the premature mortality rate for Black residents is more than double the premature mortality rate for White residents. Accidents was the lea ding cause of premature mortality among all race/ethnicities in Boston except for Asian residents, who experienced cancer as the leading cause of premature death (Table 3). COVID -19 was the second leading cause of premature mortality among Latino residents, underscoring the impact of the pandemic among this community. Notably , homicide is the fifth leading cause of death in Black and Latino communities and the homicide mortality rate for Black residents exceeds the cancer mortality rate for White residents. 13 Figure 2.

Financial stability and mobility - including income, jobs, employment, education, and workforce training -was a priority area in the 2019 Boston CHNA -CHIP . Income, work, and education are powerful social determinants of health. Jobs that pay a living wage enable workers to live in neighborhoods that promote health ( e.g., built environments that promote physical activity and resident engagement, better access to afford able healthy foods ), and provide income a nd benefits to access health care.4 In contrast, unemployment, underemployment, and job instability make it difficult to afford housing, goods and services that are linked with health , and health care, and also contribute to stressful life circumstances that affect multiple aspects of health.5 Income and Poverty In the 2019 Boston CHNA, poverty and economic instability emerged as key areas of concern among residents and there were substantial differences in income and financial security across Boston neighborhoods and by race and ethnicity. Similar to the past p rocess , focus group participants and key informants engaged in the 2022 Boston CHNA described financial stability as critically important for health. Key informant interviewees and focus group participants shared that the COVID -19 pandemic has worsened income inequalities and the level and severity of poverty for low -income residents across Boston . According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , income loss during the pandemic has disproportionately affected residents of color and low -income residents , described in more detail below . Key informants and focus group participants noted that low -income communities in Boston generally include residents of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ residents, and o lder adults on fixed incomes. Focus group participants and key informants noted that low -wage work and minimum wage is not enough for many families to survive in Boston, and that many residents are having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. Several interviewees and focus group participants discussed that while income loss has affected many people, they were most concerned about those residents who were already struggling before the pandemic - this include s low-income communities, residents of color a nd in particular immigrants, people with disabilities, and residents with a criminal record. They described the cost of living as high and rising, including escalating housing and food costs while wages have not increased. As one participant noted, \"Food p rices have gone up a lot while my wage has stayed the same.\" From April 2021 to April 2022, food prices increased an estimated 9.4%.6 \"My husband has 2 jobs so we can pay the rent and food, clothing, everything. It is really difficult now, this situation that is happening.\" - Focus group participant 15 Some key informants noted that neighborhoods that have historically experienced disinvestment continue to experience greater challenges to growth and development, and small businesses in low - income communities have been hit hard by the COVID -19 pandemic. Some elected officials describe d insufficient access to capital and financial instability as barriers to community development. Some key informants perceived that limited funding - and competition for this limited funding - contributes to some organizations not collaborating to provide access to resources. As shown in Figure 3, over 4 in 10 Boston adults (43.7%) reported that they had experienced a loss of income during the COVID -19 pandemic. Residents who identified as Black or Latino were most affected by income loss, with about 62.3% of Latino respondents indicating that they had income loss during the pandemic and nearly half of Black residents reporting income loss. More than half of adults 35 -64 years of age, adults with lower incomes, and adults with at least one child in the home reported income loss during the pandemic. When looking at income loss by occupational status, a higher proportion of a dults who were out of work or retired reported income loss during the pandemic, compared to employed adults. 16 Figure 3. Percent Adults Reporting Experiencing an Income Loss During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , December 2020 - January 2021 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Data show percentage of adults reporting their household had experienced a loss of employment income since COVID -19 occurred; Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly d ifferent compared to reference group within specific category (p <0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence Other White 18-34 years old 35-64 years old 65+ years old Less than $25,000 $25,000-$50,000 More than $50,000 Out of work Retired Other Employed At least one child in home No children in home17 Food Insecurity Strugg ling to make ends meet is directly linked with struggling to put food on the table . Food insecurity, namely barriers to accessing healthy, affordable food emerged as a key priority issue across many interviews and focus groups. Food insecurity patterns ind icate that a greater proportion of residents report experiencing food insecurity since the COVID -19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic, 2015 -2019 B BRFSS data show that about 17.8% of Boston residents were identified as food insecure - in that the food they purchased ran out before they had money to buy more (see Figure 42 in Appendi x F). The burden of food insecurity was even greater in Mattapan, Dorchester, and East Boston compared to the rest of Boston (see Figure 43 in Appendix F) . Many residents reported being food insecure during the pandemic. According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , while 20.8 % of Boston residents were considered food insecure during the pandemic, about 43 .3% of Latino residents were food insecure, as well as 32 .6% of Black residents (Figure 4). The prevalence of food insecurity was also higher among adults who had a child at home compared to adults without children . Figure 4. Percent Adults Reporting Food Purchased Did Not Last and Did Not Have Money to Get More During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , December 2020 - January 2021 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Bars with pat tern indicate reference group for its specific category; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to reference group within specific category (p <0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence 36.5% Black Latino Other White Less than $25,000 $25,000-$50,000 More than $50,000 At least one child in home No children in home \"Folks are struggling with [food] affordability. Inflation on goods has been astronomical.\" - Focus group participant 18 Community leaders and resident s discussed that healthy food is available, but not accessible to lower - income residents. As noted by a focus group participant, \"We live in a food desert. I have to travel out of town to find healthy food. The grocery store in [my neighborhood] doesn't ca rry the same healthy foods as towns that are more affluent. I feel badly for those who don't have a car and don't have access to healthier food .\" Participants also talked about how the cost of food is rising, contributing to growing levels of food insecur ity as residents struggled to afford food, let alone healthy food. As one focus group participant mentioned, \"Access to healthy food is challenging because food costs are so high. When you have a big family, it gets very complicated. Healthy food is very c onnected to a healthy community. \" Several residents underscored that many low -income residents have not been able to eat healthy foods during the COVID -19 pandemic due to financial constraints and some residents - such as older adults - face barriers to safely accessing food due to concern about virus transmission. Many residents are accessing food assistance. According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , about 23.1% of Boston adults reported using food assistance services during the COVID -19 pandemic (Figure 5), compared to 16.1% reported pre -pandemic . Approximately 40% of Latino (40.4%) and Black (39.3%) adults reported using food assistance services during the COVID -19 pandemic, compared to 7.9% of White adults. Additionally, 38.0% of adults with children in the home reported using food assistance during the COVID -19 pandemic, compared to 17.3% of adults who did not have children in the home. Figure 5.

A key pattern that emerged from intervi ews and focus groups was significant job loss linked with the COVID - 19 pandemic. Similar to the rest of the country, t he greater Boston metropolitan area fluctuated dramatically in unemployment rate during the pandemic. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Boston metro area's unemployment rate was 16.0% during the early stages of the pandemic in April 2020 and has dropped to 3.7% nearly two years later in February 2022. Additionally, as of December 2021, an estimated 56,900 workers in Massachusetts have left the labor force ; this pattern is not reflected in current unemployment rates.8 Employment Challenges Even with more opportunities available, focus g roup and interview participants observed that some residents are still struggling to find jobs after losing work during the COVID -19 pandemic . Residents explained that it has been more difficult for residents of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, and residents with a criminal record to find and secure stable jobs. For example, interviewees discussed the barrier of being flagged for a criminal record: \"People can have a CORI for the silliest thing, and it follows [them] for the rest of [their] life and can prevent them from being hired.\" Immigrant focus group participants discussed the challenges of being undocumented, as one resident mentioned, \"If you don't have a social [security number], you can't get a job. Even at McDonald's.\" Others talked about the importance of needing to know some one at the place of employment to even be considered for a job. Elected officials and focus group participants cited lack of access to workforce development training as a concern . As one focus group participant commented, \"[I]f you don't have the training , you won't be considered. There need to be more options.\" Some participants described experiencing discrimination in hiring , citing that Black men and those with disabilities seem to be the least likely to be hired for some positions . Some you th focus group participants observed that college is too expensive and expressed interest in more resources to pursue career options that do not require a coll ege degree. Employment and the COVID -19 Pandemic Residents also discussed their employment challenges during the height of the pandemic. They recalled how unemployment applications were a major burden, and many working undocumented immigrants who are paid informally were not able to apply for or access payroll protection or COVID -19 relief funds. Focus group participants and key informants mentioned that lo w-wage workers, especially immigrants, worked in high -risk job settings with limited personal protective equipment (PPE). As shown in Figure 6, nearly half -- 45.5% -- of Boston residents indicated that they worked outside of their home during the COVID -19 pandemic. \"I see that there is work and people apply [...]. I've applied [to] a lot of places and am not given jobs. It says 'apply, help wanted,' but if you don't know anyone you won't be considered.\" - Focus group participant 20 On the positive side, s ome participants in focus groups and interviews mentioned a growth in the ability to work remotely, which they described as helpfu l for residents who experience transportation barriers and persons with complex health issues. Figure 6.

Community leaders and residents discussed how many children struggle in school , especially during the pandemic. Based on the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, about 14.5% of Boston adults with children reported that they had unmet educational needs for children or teens during the COVID -19 pandemic (see Appendix F for data tables ). Focus group and interview participa nts discussed that remote learning and the COVID -19 pandemic was particularly hard for youth who already face disproportionate challenges in school. In the 2021 - 2022 school year , 30.1% of Boston Public School students were identified as Limited English Pro ficient (LEP) or English Language Learners (ELL) and nearly 6 8.9% of students were considered economically disadvantaged (participating in one or more state -administered programs of SNAP, TAFDC, DCF, or MassHealth) . Interview and focus group participants d iscussed the need for greater investment 41.7% 39.0% 47.6% 50.1% 44.0%Boston Asian Black Latino Other White At least one child in home No children in home \"If you have an asthmatic student and they are constantly out especially in the wintertime [...] asthma doctors should educate parents and tell them about resources like getting a 504 plan [...] so they won't get in trouble for truancy and ensure the child has support while there in school.\" - Key informant interview 21 the social, emotional, and academic needs of these children and youth. In particular, participants discussed their insufficient access to early childhood education, the need for more after school programs, s upport for enrolling children in school with proper educational plans in place, school dropout, health and economic barriers that affect school attendance, and the need for adult English classes for residents for whom English is not their primary language. From the 2020 to 2021 academic school year, PreK-12th grade Massachusetts student enrollment declined by 37,396 students.9 CHIP PRIORITY AREA - HOUSING : AFFORDABILITY, QUALITY, HOMELESSNESS, HOMEOWNERSHIP, GENTRIFICATION, AND DISPLACEMENT As in previous assessment s, housing affordability is a dominant concern among Boston residents and leaders and has only been exacerbated during the pandemic . Housing - including housing affordability, quality, homelessness, homeownership, gentrification, and displacement - was a priority area identified in the 2019 community health needs assessment and community health improvement plan . Housing is typically the largest household expense , and, for homeowners, housing can be an important source of wealth.10,11 For low -income residents, housing instability, the stress of unaffordable housing costs, and poor housing quality increase the risk of adverse health outcomes.12 Housing concerns in the city have been pervasive for years. The sentiment has not changed, and many residents have been even more concerned about being able to afford where they live during the COVID -19 pandemic. Housing Affordability Pre-pandemic, an estimated 6.7% of Boston BBRFS S adult respondents in 2015 -2019 reported moving in the past three years due to housing affordability. Reports of moving due to housing costs were highest for residents in Dorchester, Allston/Brighton, and Mattapan (Figure 7). In discussions, r esidents and leaders were even more concerned about high housing costs during the pandemic, especially given fluctuations in employment. In the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , more than 4 in 10 respo ndents reported that they have had trouble paying their rent or mortgage during the COVID -19 pandemic, with highest proportions reported among Latino, Asian and Black adults, and adults with children in the home (Figure 8). \"Every year they raise the rent. They stopped during the pandemic , but I was told that they are going to raise it again. I can't imagine how much they are going to raise it. I can't move to other places because it's worse there.\" -Focus group participant 22 Figure 7.

When discussing a lack of affordable housing, several residents in focus groups described a b ackdrop of gentrification and overdevelopment as a contributor to housing displacement for low -income residents. Some residents also discussed racism around unfair housing prices, language barriers to accessing housing, and discrimination in acceptance of housing vouchers by landlords and among those previously incarcerated . Focus group participants discussed high and rising rent, rising costs of housing and property taxes, and prioritizing paying rent over other health -promoting factors such as food and ph ysical activity. Housing Instability and Transiency Participants discussed how the intersection between housing assistance and housing instability was a tenuous one. Some focus group participants noted that many landlords d o not participate in rental assistance programs offered by the government, and that they are concerned that rental assistance programs instituted during the COVID -19 pandemic are coming to an end. However, s ome residents also discussed the paradox of qualifying for low -income housing assistance, observing that the income threshold for affordable housing means that if residents earn higher wages, they stand to lose their housing voucher, yet they cannot afford housing at the market rate. Additionally, s ome key informants observed that while there were several policies enacted during the pandemic that aimed to help tenants stay in their homes (e.g., rent control, eviction moratorium) , the increases in housing costs and limited availability of affordable housing were still major challenges . Residents shared that lack of affordable housing contributes to experiences of homelessness and housing instability, overcrowded housing, and housing displacement , each of which are linked with poor mental health outcomes .13 Some interview and focus gr oup participants noted that people experiencing homelessness include families and residents who were evicted from their homes and observed that people experiencing homelessness are often criminalized. Housing Conditions, Overcrowding , and COVID -19 Focus group and interview participants discussed how the COVID -19 pandemic affected housing instability, homelessness , and increasingly residents moving in with others due to income loss , which contribu tes to overcrowded housing . Residents no ted that COVID -19 cases often affect several household members, which they linked to multiple generations living in household and people working multiple jobs outside of the home . They noted that it is difficult to isolate or quarantine from family members due to dense living conditions . Participants discussed that t hese conditions, especially during COVID lockdown, also contribute to worsening mental health. As one focus group participant commented, \"When folks lost their jobs 2 years ago, they were sudden ly crammed in houses, which affected physical health and mental well -being.\" Another critical aspect to housing infrastructure, especially during the pandemic is access to Internet. As discussed in the Access to Services section, Internet access became a critical household resource during the COVID -19 pandemic given the dependence on remote work, education, and health care for many populations. While about 9 in 10 Boston adults reported having Internet access at home during the COVI D-19 pandemic, it is notable that a smaller percent of Latino adults reported Internet access at home compared to White adults (86.0% and 96.2%, respectively) (Figure 9). 24 Figure 9. Percent Adults Reporting Having Internet Access at Home During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , December 2020 - January 2021 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to reference group within specific category (p <0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence interval CHIP PRIORITY AREA - BEHAVIORAL HEA LTH: MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE Community leaders and residents described trauma, stress, depression, and anxiety as top-of-mind concerns among all populations, but some groups were cited as being disproportionately impacted - such as youth, low -income households, caregivers, elders, and people of color . Behavioral health , including mental health and substance use, was another priority area identified in the 2019 Boston community health needs assessment and improvement plan. Behavioral health is an overarching term for the connection bet ween behaviors and people's mental and physical health. Trauma , Racism, and Discrimination Trauma and related issues were discussed among a number of residents and leaders in assessment conversations. Several participants discussed the characteristics of childhood trauma - such as racism, violence, poverty, home environments, housing conditions, addiction, neglect, and the loss of loved ones - and how they have affected all aspects of a person's life, including their health and their economic opportunity. * 88.9% 86.0% * 85.8% 96.2% 94.5% 91.6%Boston Asian Black Latino Other White At least one child in home No children in home25 The mental health of caregivers is one of many potential sources of childhood trauma. About 18.0% of Boston residents reported having lived with a caregiver with mental illness as a child (Figure 10). About 1 in 4 adults in Allston/Brighton reported having lived with a caregiver with a mental illness when they were young, followed by about one in five adults in Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and Dorchester (02121, 02125) .

Interview and focus group participants noted that t hese concern s have all increased during the pandemic. Additional traumatic stressors identified by key informants and focus group participants include community violence, domestic violence (especially during the pandemic and the challenges of staying home when in an a busive relationship ), grief from loss of loved ones during the COVID -19 pandemic, and participants how racism and discrimination affects the mental well -being of residents of color , citing the role of intergenerational trauma, such as the history of slavery; stereotypes that devalue people of color; and \"white -washing\" critical histories and cultural practices of people of color. Several participants mentioned systemic racism and white supremacy as affecting multiple opportunities and facets of life, including jobs, housing, safety, and educational opportunities. As shown in Figure 11, 6.4% of BBRFS S respondents in 2015 -2019 indicated that they have been threatened at least a few times a month due to discrimination. This is significantly greater among Black and Latino residents (9.5% and 8.2% , respectively) . These numbers increase dramatically for residents who indicated they have been threatened at least once a year because of discrimination, with 17 .3% of all Boston residents reporting this (see Appendix F for data tables ).

Participants also noted that LGBTQ IA+ residents of color experience stress related to discriminatory experiences that target multiple aspects of their identities. Community Violence and Interactions with the Police Community violence and interactions with the police are public health issues that contribute to trauma and affect physical and mental health . Neighborhood safety concerns were a discussion topic among focus group and interview participants. According to 2015 -2019 BBRFS S data, 14.4% of Boston residents perceived their neighborhoods as unsafe, with the highest percentage of residents from Dorchester (all zip codes), Mattapan, and Roxbury indicating concerns about neighborhood safety ( Figure 12). Many focus group and interview participants reiterated these sentiments and also discussed that they were concerned about a decrease in neighborhood safety, particularly around gang -affiliated violence, during the pandemic. Figure 12.

While they saw an increa se in greater dialogue around police violence towards communities of color, community leaders and residents noted that greater strides still needed to be made. According to 2015 -2019 BBRFS S data, about 30 .0% of Black adults in Boston and 14.6 % of Latino adults reported ever feeling like they were stopped by police due to their race or ethnicity, compared to just 2.3% of White adults (Figure 13).

Mental Heal th, Depression, and Suicide Mental health overall was a key issue pre -pandemic, and n ot surprisingly, the impact of the pandemic only heightened that concern. According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , during the COVID -19 pandemic 16.8% of Boston adul ts reported experiencing persistent sadness - defined as feeling down, depressed, or hopeless more than half of the days in the previous 2 weeks (Figure 14). Overall, 21.9% of Boston adults reported feeling persistent anxiety during the pandemic - having felt nervous, anxious, or on edge for more than half of the days in the past 2 weeks (Figure 15). 12.0% 6.8% * 30.0% * * 14.9% * 10.2%Boston Asian Black Latino Other White Less than HS graduate HS graduate Some college or more29 Several focus group and interview partici pants discussed how the COVID -19 pandemic worsened mental health issues, including: social isolation, fear about contracting the virus, feeling overwhelmed by constant and changing information about the pandemic, and uncertainty about what the pandemic h olds. In several discussions , participants also attributed the COVID -19 pandemic to worsening the high levels of stress that many low-income families already experience. They also noted that the resources that facilitate community connections, such as in-person meeting spaces and community centers , have been closed at times due to COVID -19 safety measures, and these closures hamper community building efforts. Some also noted that the COVID -19 pandemic contribute s to trauma for older adults, who have lost many friends and family during the pandemic. Figure 14.

Pre-pandemic , about 13.9% of Boston high school students reported having had suicidal thoughts , according to 2015 -2019 data from the YRBS . About 29.2 % of LGBTQ IA+ students reported hav ing had suicidal thoughts , based on the YRBS (Figure 16). Focus group and interview participants discussed that they were especially concerned about mental health worsening among youth during the pandemic . Youth focus group members cited insufficient sleep, family issues, unhealthy relationships, the stress of sc hool, busy schedules that make it difficult to practice self -care, peer pressure, and unhealthy coping mechanisms as factor s that affect their mental health. Several interviews and focus group discussions emphasized the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on children and youth, including the disruption of their routines and trauma, despair, adverse childhood experiences, overcrowded housing, and addiction. Y outh described being exposed to toxic environments at home during stay -at-home phase of the COVID -19 pandemic. The well -being of adults who support youth also emerged as a concern, including c aregivers who have taken care of others during the COVID - 19 pandemic and have not have the opportunity to also care for themselves and teachers and school staff who re spond to behavioral health issues in school 17.1% 24.7% 16.4% 24.5% 20.3% 22.7%Boston Asian Black Latino Other White At least one child in home No children in home31 Figure 16.

Participants discussed several barriers to accessing mental health care. On the supply and demand side, community leaders and residents in interviews and focus g roups observed a limited number of mental health providers in the community and in school settings, long wait lists, and few mental health services for children. One provider noted that behavioral health referrals were at the highest level that they could recall. Financial barriers to mental health care identified by key informants and focus group participants included bureaucratic barriers, such as needing a referral from a primary care provider, and limited mental health options for low -income communities. Several focus group participants described a lack of culturally appropriate and linguistically congruent care for low -income residents, residents of color, and LGBTQIA+ residents . Some focus group participants discussed stigma surrounding ment al health care, particularly for immigrant communities, communities of color, and youth. As one resident noted, \"They think asking for help is a weakness, not Latino Other White LGBTQ Heterosexual/non-transgender32 Figure 17. Percent Adults Reporting Not Seeking Mental He alth Care Due to Cost During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , December 2020 - January 2021 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Data show percentage of adults reporting there was a time when they needed to see a mental health professional but could not because of cost since March 1, 2020; Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category; No significant differences compared to reference group s within specific categor ies were observed (p>0.05) ; Error bars show 95% confidence interval Substance Use While substanc e use emerged as a key concern among Boston residents prior to the pandemic, substance use was less commonly discussed as a health concern in recent focus groups and interviews perhaps because residents largely discussed how the COVID -19 pandemic worsened inequities in the social determinants of health. However, mortality data continues to indicate that overdose deaths are an important health issue. In the 2019 community health needs assessment, unintentional opioid overdoses accounted for the majority of deaths due to accidents in 2016. In 2020 -2021, the unintentional opioid overdose mortality rate was highest in Dorcheste r (all zip codes), Roxbury, and the South End (Figure 75 in Appendix F) . The unintentional opioid overdose mortality rate for Black and Latino residents exceeded that for White residents in 2020 -2021 (Figure 76 in Appendix F) . Additionally, the unintentional opioid overdose death rate among Black residents was 50 .7 per 100,000 res idents in 2020 -2021 whereas it was 21.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016. The difference was much less stark for Latino and White residents over this time period. Some focus group participants discussed substance use concerns, including misuse of drugs, ove rusing prescriptions and over -the-counter medicines, and smoking nicotine and marijuana. Residents discussed substance use concerns as particularly affecting LGBTQIA+ residents and youth, and described substance use as a coping mechanism for dealing with s tress. Several participants perceived that substance use was increasing, particularly among Cape Verdean, Asian, and Vietnamese communities. 18-34 years old 35-64 years old 65+ years old Less than $25,000 $25,000-$50,000 More than $50,000 At least one child in home No children in home33 participant described, \"I can remember as a child how it was; it was a close -knit community. When drugs started being introduced to [our] community, the children dropping out of school, it started to change .\" According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , about 27.8% of Boston adults reported increased drinking habits during the COVID -19 pandemic ( Figure 18). Almost 1 in 3 adults 18 -34 years of age and over 1 in 4 of adults 35 -64 years of age reported increased drinking during the COVID -19 pandemic, compared to 11.8% of adults 65 years of age or over .

Accessing childcare, social services, and health care was identified as a prominent theme and priority area in the previous c ommunity health needs assessment and improvement plan. Some aspect of access limitations came up in nearly every conversation in this recent process, and many issues were exacerbated during the pandemic. Accessing Childcare Services Pre-pandemic, Boston residents identified economic and access barriers to affording childcare, and in recent focus groups and interviews childcare emerged as a growing need due to the COVID -19 pandemic. While focus group participants and key informants described several commun ity-based organizations that provide services for historically marginalized groups, they also observed rising and acute social and economic needs among a growing segment of low -income residents . Affordable, quality childcare was difficult to find before th e pandemic, but with parents' unpredictable work schedules , unforeseen childcare closings, and the need for many parents to work outside the home, finding care for young children was even more challenging during the pandemic . According to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey , about 50.1% of adults with at least one child at home indicated that they worked outside the home during the COVID -19 pandemic ( see Appendix F for data tables ). In the same survey, 14.3% of Boston adults repo rted that children in their households experienced unmet childcare needs during the pandemic ( Figure 19). 35 Figure 19. Percent Adults with C hildren Reporting Having Unmet Childcare Needs During the COVID -19 Pandemic, by Boston and Selected Indicators, December 2020 -January 2021 DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, COVID -19 Health Eq uity Survey , December 2020 - January 2021 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: NA denotes where data are not available because only respondents who indicated having at least one child present in the household were asked this question; Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category; No significant differences compared to reference group s with in specific categor ies were observed (p>0.05) ; Error bars show 95% confidence interval Some focus group participants and key informants discussed how some students have not been adequately challenged academically or able to reach their full potential duri ng their schooling during the COVID -19 pandemic. Focus group participants and key informants also discussed significant and growing social and emotional needs for children and teens since the onset of the pandemic, particularly low - income children and yout h. Barriers to early childhood education cited by residents include the costs of early childhood education, restrictions on vouchers for subsidized childcare for low -income families, limited availability of early childhood education centers, and limited un derstanding of the benefits of early childhood education. Accessing Social and Other Services Focus group and interview participants discussed additional challenges of accessing the range of social and other services that might be available. These barriers included limited transportation, difficulty navigating application processes, limited Internet for completing applications, and lack of eligibility due to immigration/documentation status. A number of participants across conversations also discu ssed system ic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination as interwoven into U.S. social, economic, educational, and health care systems. Many discussed how our current systems are set up to perpetuate current inequities. Others talked about facing discri mination themselves, in stores, restaurants, employment, or housing. From 2015 -2019 BBRFS S data , about 28 .4% of Boston residents reported receiving poor service at restaurants or stores in day-to-day life due to their race or ethnicity (Figure 20). About 45 .5% of Black 14.3% NABoston Asian Black Latino Other White At least one child in home No children in home36 experiencing poor service , while 3 7.6% of Latino adults and 3 4.7% of Asian adults indicated having this experience . Figure 20. Percent Adults Reporting Receiving Poor Service Due to Their Race/Ethnicity, by Boston and Selected Indicators, 2015, 2017, and 2019 Combined DATA SOURCE: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015, 2017, and 2019 Combined DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Data show percentage of adults reporting receiving poorer service than other people at restaurants or stores in day -to-day life due to race/ethnicity; Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category ; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to reference group within specific category (p <0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence interval Accessing Health Care Services Although about 95.8% of Boston residents have health insurance (see Appendix F for detailed data ), focus group and interview participants cited numerous barriers to accessing health care services in gener al and especially during the pandemic. Overall Barriers to Health Care Key i nformants and focus group participants in 2022 cited some very similar barriers to accessing health care as they did in the previous community health needs assessment. Recent focus group participant s noted that income -related barriers to accessing care were common and include d income restrictions for qualifying for MassHealth , a lack of insurance benefits linked with employment, unaffordable out -of-pocket and surprise medical expenses not covered by health insurance, the high cost of medications (partic ularly Black Latino Other White 18-24 years old 25-44 years old 45-64 years old 65+ years old Female Male \"Due to my language barriers, I was not able to express my health concerns and had a hard time to communicate with doctors to get right treatment.\" - Focus group participant 37 for people with chronic illnesses), and the challenge of finding a job that provides insurance benefits. Participants also discussed distrust towards health care systems and health providers, concern about undocumented legal status, difficulty navig ating the health care system, lack of cultural sensitivity among providers, long waits for medical appointments, transportation barriers, and difficulty securing a medical appointment. Residents shared that language barriers and limited culturally releva nt care make it difficult to navigate and access health care and social services and to follow treatment plans for residents for whom English is not their first language . This was particularly salient in conversations with Cape Verdean Creole speakers. Barriers Specific to People with Disabilities and Older Adults Some participants described limited staffing and support for home health care as a concer n, particularly for older adults and residents with disabilities. Participants with disabilities described several barriers to health care, including: lack of accessible equipment (e.g., exam tables, scales, assistance with wheelchair transfers), communication barriers (e.g., interpretation) , the need for support in completing forms, limited training among providers in treating patients with a range of disabilities, denial of access to care (e.g., psychological services, rehabilitation, nursing homes) for people with developmental disabilities, limited information about available resources or services needed, and lack of reliable Internet service. Participants also described a g rowth in telehealth visits . They noted that conducting assessments and developing treatment plans can be difficult during telehealth visits and that telehealth vis its can be a barrier for older adults, immigrants, and persons with disabilities. Participants noted that some patients prefer in -person visits and cited several barriers to using telehealth, including technological resources, support, and training needed. Health Care Access Specific to the COVID -19 Pandemic Residents described how r acial/ethnic inequities in health care access and social factors that impact health care access - such as transportation and Internet access - have been magnified by the COVI D-19 pandemic. Some residents noted that patients who rely on family support for interpretation during visits have lost this support due to COVID -19 policies that limit visits to the patient only . Some key informants and focus group participants discussed how residents with chronic health conditions and those with undiagnosed conditions have been affected by delayed health care and ongoing lack of a medical home. Getting tested for COVID -19 had its own set of challenges. Respondents of the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey cited a number of barriers to getting tested for COVID -19. Having a referral or symptoms to quali fy for a test , finding a clinic that offered COVID testing, the length of time that it takes to get tested, and long wait times to receive COVID test results were the leading barriers to COVID -19 testing among Boston residents in December 2020/January 2021 ( Figure 21). However, according to the COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, more than one in five Boston residents also cited issues such as transportation, getting time off of work, and cost of a test as barriers to getting a COVID test in December 2020 -January 2021 . Appendix F has the breakdown of data by race/ethnicity and age for each of these barriers. 38 Figure 21.

Lack of access to technology also emerged as a barrier to C OVID -19 information, particularly for older adults who relied on family and friends to use technological devices to sign up for COVID -19 resources or access COVID -19 information. Residents also described rampant misinformation about COVID -19. COMMUNITY'S VISION AND COMMUNITY SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE Interview and focus group participants shared numerous ideas for collective action for the future including : addressing systemic racism, strengthening collaboration, improving economic development and housi ng, improving access to behavioral health and health care services, promoting youth development, and creating a healthier or Symptoms which Qualify For Testing Finding a Clinic Offering a Test Time to Get Tested Long Wait Time for Test Results Transportation Getting Time Off From Work Doctor Not Offering Test Cost of Test Arranging Childcare Not Having a Personal Doctor Other Factors39 Deepen Partnerships with Local Communities and Collaborate to Promote Health Equity While some interviewees desc ribed effective collaboration happening throughout the city , they discussed several barriers to collaboration . These challenges included decentralized partnerships and competition for funding among local non -profit organizations, which they noted undermine s relationship building. Several interviewees called for creating and strengthening partnerships that create and implement long -term strategic plans to promote community health and developing and deepening long -term relationships between City of Boston age ncies (e.g., schools, housing, public health), hospitals, and smaller community -based organizations. To accomplish these goals, key informants recommended centering the voices of affected residents in planning and implementation processes, engaging communi ty builders and community organizers, funding community -based initiatives to implement strategies to address health inequities, and creating centralized mechanisms to share information and resources with residents. Key informants also recommended dissemina ting CHNAs and CHIPs in modes that improve access to the general public and center resident voices. Focus on Dismantling Systemic Racism Interview participants' recommendations to address systemic racism included developing hospital -based reparations fund s for neighborhoods such as Roxbury, in which hospital campuses are based and which also experience persistent health inequities and developing land trusts that can serve as community spaces. Another recommendation pertained to providing continual educatio n (e.g., Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion training) for institutions and people who work with people of color and low -income communities to improve understanding of and build capacity to address systemic racism and implicit bias. One key informant recommen ded that schools, businesses, non -profit organizations, governmental, and health care sectors participate in this training. Create Opportunities that Foster Economic Stability and Mobility Recommendations for improving employment opportunities included partnering with small businesses to recruit and hire local residents and pay workers a living wage, fostering work environments that are inclusive of LGBTQIA+ communities, and addressing discrimination in hiring and work environments. Additional recommendations included creating opportunities for immigrant health professionals who trained and practiced in their home country to work in the local health care system, improving job training opportunities designed to facilitate economic mobility for yo uth and \"Economic justice goes along with health. To have a healthy community, there's going to be healthy economic activity because it takes psychological, mental, emotional, good way of being for a business to function effectively .\" - Key informant interview \"[There is opportunity] for closer collaborative work in the city. There is a challenge and advantage of having so many different institutions that are working in the same or overlapping neighborhoods.\" - Key informant interview 40 adults, and bringing hospitals and community -based organizations together to create health careers training programs for youth. Strategies to address growing income inequities , as recommended by key informants and interview participants, included containing rising costs, taxing wealthy households and corporations, ensuring residents have life insurance, and forgiving student loans. While several key informants noted that there are several social and economic resources available to support Boston re sidents, key informants and focus group participants emphasized the importance of connecting residents with these resources and services. Recommendations for supporting immigrants include creating pathways for immigrants to complete any credentialing neede d to enable them to work locally, supporting immigrants seeking asylum, and increasing volunteer -based programs to support immigrant communities. Improving resources and services for veterans and LGBTQIA+ communities also emerged as recommendations. Improve Housing Affordability Community leaders' and residents' recommendations for promoting housing affordability and stability pertained to improving the availability of low -income housing , increasing access to affordable housing through programs such a s rent control and rental assistance , and using vacant buildings as homeless shelters. Another set of recommendations by participants pertained to investing in homeownership models for low -income residents, including asset building programs such as rent -to-own programs for affordable housing and housing loans for low -income residents. Institutionally, one recommendation pertained to ensuring that development projects include credits that are returned to the community to improve housing access and quality. Improv e Access to and Quality of Behavioral Health Care Recommendations by interview and focus group participants to improve access to mental health care included making therapy accessible to low - income communities and in the primary language of patients; strengthening mental health care in community health centers; improving access to mental health for youth; and increasing awareness about and addressing stigma around mental health services. In terms of improving quality of mental health care, recommendat ions included increasing culturally congruent care for residents of color and LGBTQIA+ communities; providing peer-to-peer and group therapy models ; and incorporat ing art therapy to engage youth in mental health care. Other recommendations included providi ng a list of mental health resources that is available in residents' primary language; training community -based stakeholders to respond to mental health crises; and addressing substance use and addiction through mental health care. Strengthen Health Care Poli cies and Improv e Health Care Access and Quality To improve health care coverage and access, key informants and focus group participants recommended supporting residents in enrolling in MassHealth and other programs for low -income residents such as food and cash aid benefits; lowering health insurance rates; providing access to a wider range of affordable health plans; compensating spouses as personal care assistants under MassHealth; and covering personal protective equipment through health insurance. \"We need more mental health services that are not rooted in the white dominant culture , but that are rooted in people's cultural experiences.\" - Key informant interview 41 Interview and focus group participants also discussed the importance of improving access to preventive and specialty care (e.g., audiology, ophthalmology, podiatry) and c ollaborat ing with grassroots organizations when designing efforts to improve health care access . Residents also cited the need to make health care more accessible by providing care in patients' primary language, ensuring that health care is available at times that are feasible for residents who work multiple jobs, addressing transportation barriers to accessing health care. To improve provider sensitivity to patients' needs, residents recommended recruiting more bilingual providers and providers of color to more close ly reflect underserved patient populations; training providers to better serve people of color , low -income residents, and people with disabilities ; and ensuring providers are connected with the communities they serve. A recommendation related to the soci al determinants of health and health care access included providing wrap -around services by addressing multiple health care needs (e.g., preventive care, vaccines). Relatedly, key informants and focus group participants suggested connecting residents with community -based resources in clinic or other community -based (e.g., churches, schools, YMCA) settings located in low -income communities and communities of color. Key informants and focus group participants recommended using this local, centralized setting to connect patients with community resources, leverage medical -legal partnerships to improve residents' access to legal supports, coordinate care for seniors, support the transition from pediatric to adult care, and improve care and support for people with disabilities. One key informant recommended building the capacity of community health workers or other peer -to-peer models to support residents in navigating social and health care systems and to build resident awareness of health issues. Promot e Child and Youth Development Key informants and focus group participants recommended a number of strategies to promote child and youth development. In the school context, recommendations included providing more funding for schools and creating programs where sch ool nurses provide hygiene kits for students. Another set of recommendations pertained to creating more community -based spaces for youth, such as fully -staffed libraries and community centers, which could provide support with academics, opportunities to be active, workforce development opportunities, connect residents to resources, and bring longstanding and new residents together. Another recommendation included affirming LGBTQIA+ youth. Supporting caregivers and low -income families also emerged as a recom mendation, including improving parent supports to access resources and services and navigate educational and criminal justice systems. Create a Healthier Built and Physical Environment Having a healthier built and physical environment - built environment, green space, and air quality \u2014 was important to focus group and interview participants, and they cited a number of suggestions for the future. Residents described the importance of improving air quality, providing families with air filters, cleaning up vandalism and trash, improving transportation, and providing affordable Internet access and improving digital literacy for low -income residents an d older adults. Focus group participants described opportunities for promoting physical activity, such as creating affordable access to gyms, yoga, meditation, and community walks and bike rides. Recommendations for improving access to healthy and affordab le food included bringing healthy food to neighborhoods that lack access to healthy, affordable food; improving school lunches to offer healthy, fresh food; and providing nutrition education to LGBTQIA+ communities. 42 PRIORITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE ACTION The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative aims to undertake a collaborative planning process May -September 2022 to identify the prioritized issues on which this cross -sector group will take action. For the past two years, the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative has been focused on four priority areas and implementing the 70 strategies outlined in the 2020 community health improvement plan. Great progress has been made on many of these strategies, while other strategies have not been implemented as extensively given c onstrained capacity and the current context of the COVID -19 pandemic. Given this backdrop, the 2022 prioritization process focused on: 1) reaffirming the previous priorities and identifying any new issues that have emerged; and 2) prioritizing specific strategies within these major areas that should be lifted up for future action. To this end, in May -June 2022, the Collaborative under took a collaborative prioritization process to solicit community input on the key strategies for collective impact to focus their 2022 community health improvement plan. Identified and Reaffirmed Priorities The p rioritization process was centered o n the data from this 2022 CHNA and the current CHIP which has four main priority areas and an overarching central focus of achieving racial and ethnic health equity : 1: Housing Focusing on affordability, quality, homelessness, ownership, gentrification and displacement 2: Financial Security and Mobility Focusing on jobs, employment, income, education, and workforce training which comprised this priority in the past CHIP, and inc luding food security which emerged as a salient issue in the 2022 CHNA 3: Behavioral Health Focusing on mental health and substance use 4: Accessing Services Focusing on healthcare, childcare, and social services Criteria for Prioritization The Collaborative aimed to use a systemic, engaged approach informed by data to confirm the larger priority areas and prioritize the specific strategies for focus in future planning and implementation efforts. The following cri teria were used to help participants identify priority strategies from the current CHIP. Burden: How much does this issue affect health in Boston? Equity: Will addressing this issue substantially benefit those most in need?43 Impact: Can working on this is sue achieve both short -term and long -term change? Feasibility: Is it possible to address this issue given infrastructure, capacity, and political will? Collaboration/Engagement: Are there existing groups across sectors willing to work together on this issue? Is there an opportunity for engaging these groups? Data: Do we have data to support this objective and strategy? Prioritization Process The prioritization process was multi -stepped and aimed to be inclusive, participatory, and data driven. During May -June 2022, several steps were taken to confirm the larger priority areas and identify the prioritized strategies for the upcoming planning process. A total of 62 participants were part of the prioritization process, and activities included the followi ng: Three separate 90 -minute virtual listening sessions were conducted in late May and early June. In each of these sessions, Collaborative members presented key findings and high -level themes from this current CHNA to provide context for prioritization. Following the data presentation, listening session participants (n=15) were asked to complete an online survey to select priority strategies using the criteria described above. Based on low participation during the scheduled listening sessions, the surv ey and a pre -recorded data presentation were sent to all registered participants who did not attend. The survey was open for an additional 24 -hours, and an additional 5 respondents completed the prioritization survey. To increase participation in the pr ocess, Collaborative members attended a Union Capital Boston (UCB) meeting on 6/7/22 to gather additional feedback. 42 community members participated in a break -out session that included a brief data presentation and dialogue about the prioritization proce ss. These participants discussed which areas most resonated with them and provided feedback on which strategies to prioritize. Feedback from this session was incorporated with the earlier survey responses, and these results were posted on the Collaborative's website in 10 languages (Arabic, Cape Verdean, Chinese traditional - Cantonese, Chinese simplified - Mandarin, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese) to gather additional community input prior to the late June planning session. The feedback form was shared with the Collaborative Steering Committee for distribution to communities via email. These discussions reaffirmed these four priority area s. The cross -cutting and overarching focus of the planning process will continue to be around Achieving Racial and Ethnic Health Equity recognizing that institutional racism and structural inequities are what drive the health disparities we see around race, ethnicity, and language in the city for nearly all issues. The Collaborative will meet to develop a CHIP that will provide a blueprint to address t he prioritized strategies listed above . The CHIP development process will include a virtual planning session in late June 2022 to refine the CHIP document based on community input. A 2022 CHIP will be finalized in Fall 2022. 44 APPENDIX A. STRUCTURE OF THE ) is a group of Boston community residents, community -based organizations, community development corporations, health centers, the hospitals , and the Boston Public Health Commission . This group has come together to achieve sustainable positive change in the health of the city by collaborating with communities, sharing knowledge, aligning resources, and addressing root causes of health inequities. One of the fundamental approaches for this work is to conduct a community health needs assessment so efforts are informed by data and community members themselves. While community health assessment and planning have been long - standing endeavors among organizatio ns across the city, the Collaborative aims to leverage, align, and coordinate efforts and resources across multi -sector stakeholders in Boston . More details about the Collaborative's structure and engagement can be found in the Methods section of this repo rt, Appendices A -C, and at http://www.bostonchna.org/ . The Collaborative's structure provide s a framework for large -scale engagement to improve the community's health. This structure includes: Steering Committee - compris ing of 19 members representing hospitals, health centers, Boston Public Health Commission, a public health organization focused on community, community development corporations, and community representatives. Its role is to provide strategic direction and oversight of the process (See Appendix B for list of Steering Committee members). Operations Committee - compris ing of the Steering Committe e co-chairs and the Collaborative's Coordinator . This Committee resolves operational issues requiring immediate actions. Work grou ps - compris ing of Steering Committee members and general membership . The two Work Groups for the CHNA provide d input and assistance on implementing activities (See Appendix B for members). For the Boston CHNA, these two W ork Groups were : o Community Engagement/Primary Data Work Group - includ ing 24 members representing a range of organizations, including hospitals, health centers, local public health, community development, and community -based organizations. The Work Group's charge is to pro vide guidance on the approach to community engagement, input on primary data collections methods, and support with logistics for primary data collection . o Secondary Data Work Group - includ ing 16 members representing a range of organizations, including hospitals, health centers, and local public health. The Work Group's charge is to provide guidance on secondary data approach and indicators and foster connections with key networks and groups to provide relevant data. o Additional Work Groups - Additionally, the Collaborative has comprised work groups for the planning and implementation of the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). This includes a work group to prepare for the 2022 CHIP process and four work groups that are focused on overseeing and implementing the strategies of the 2019 CHIP (one per priority area: behavioral health, financial security and mobility, housing, and access to services) General membership attends events, shares in formation, and participates in work groups. Over 400 people are engaged in communication with the Collaborative's activities. 45 APPENDIX B.

ONGOING PARTNER AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS Ongoing Partner and Community Engagement Community health improvement efforts can only be accomplished through ongoing and meaningful engagement of community members and partners across a multitude of sectors. Through the work group structure, open community meetings, email dissemination, and the vast network of partners, the Collaborative aims to engage a range of sectors in the community. The Steering Committee of the Collaborative includes local public health, hospitals, community development, health centers, and numerous community organization s. Each Steering Committee member is a champion, engaging a wide network of organizations and residents. Each Collaborative work group comprises dozens of members across sectors to advance their charge. When gaps are identified within the activities of the work groups, work group co -chairs make a concerted effort to engage those involved in that area (e.g., bringing in additional representatives from the childcare sector in Access to Services during the implementation process.) The community engagement pro cess was carried out in accordance with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Community Engagement Standards for Community Health Planning Guideline, consistent with state law, Determination of Need (DoN) Regulation found at 105 CMR 100.000 as we ll as The Attorney General's Community Benefits Guidelines for Non -Profit Hospitals. These standards establish procedures for defining the community, required stakeholders, and process steps and requirements. Through email communications, virtual and in -person meetings and listening sessions run by the Collaborative, and meetings via Steering Committee members' own structures (e.g., hospital Community Benefit Advisory Committees), community members have been and will be continuously engaged in this proces s from assessment to planning to implementation . This includes inviting broad resident and stakeholder participation in the CHIP Working Groups for each priority area. These CHIP working groups meet monthly or bi -monthly throughout the CHIP implementatio n period and are led by two Co -Chairs who manage and oversee these meetings. The CHIP Working Group Co -Chairs also update and present to the larger Collaborative Steering Committee at least three times annually and meet as a group six times annually to exp lore and discuss synergies and cross -collaboration in key CHIP implementation objectives. At the Collaborative's annual community meeting, the CHIP Working Group Co -Chairs provide updates to the larger community and move into breakout sessions to strate gize, strengthen and update CHIP working group activities and objectives, and to recruit new members to the CHIP Working Groups. Communicating about the Assessment Findings As mentioned in the Priorities for Collaborative Action section in this report, the CHNA findings were shared with community members in four different listening sessions in May -June 2022. During these sessions, Collaborative members presented on the assessment findings and engage d in a discussion with community members on what resonated with them and where there are gaps to inform a systematic prioritization process for planning . In total, 62 community members participated in this process. 49 Once this report is final, it will b e posted on the Collaborative's website , and an announcement with the link to the report will be emailed out to the Collaborative mailing list, nearly 400 people that comprise of residents and community organization staff from across sectors including hous ing, transportation, economic development, public health, healthcare, and the faith community. Continuous Updating and Revising of the Assessment Review of data is a critical part of the planning and implementation process. The Collaborative has data sharing agreements with the Boston Public Health Commission and strong relationships with institutions and organizations across the city . These institutions are part of the Community Health Improvement Planning (CHIP) implementation work groups. During these work group meetings, data from the specific priority areas will be continuously examined to ensure that strategies are appropriate for and aligned to the community's needs. In the past cycle, the ongoing CHIP implementation work groups (one per priority area) used the 2019 CHNA data to develop their initial list of strategies. In 2020 and on, they continually worked with the Boston Public Health Commission and community -based organizations to co llect and synthesize new data, particularly with a focus on how the COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated inequities and identified areas of urgent need. For example, during the process, real -time data indicated that many residents were facing a loss of income, i ncreased risk of eviction, and loss of childcare during the pandemic. This guided the CHIP implementation work groups so that they could nimbly adjust to current circumstances: the Financial Security and Mobility group focused more on employment -related s trategies, the Housing work group focused more on eviction issues, and the Access to Services ramped up their strategies addressing childcare needs. This was only made possible via the broad cross -section of partnerships within each work group. These issue areas were identified as critical for further review during the 2022 CHNA process . In addition to carrying forward the foregoing processes into the next cycle, the Collaborative plans to hold annual community meetings in order to provide updates to the c ommunity on CHIP progress and objectives, and to gain additional input and recommendations from Community Members on current and future activity within each working group. The Collaborative has held annual community meetings each year, with the exception o f 2021 when virtually all Collaborative members shifted to responding to a significant surge in community transmission of COVID -19 and increased hospitalizations. As new data and community input is generated and synthesized through these processes , it will also be reviewed at least annually for the purposes of identifying any potential enhancements or additions to the CHNA. 50 APPENDIX D. TECHNICAL NOTES ON CHNA QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS AND DATA Quantitative Data - Secondary Data How Indicators and Data Sources were Identified The Secondary Data Work Group members identified the goals of the secondary data as: 1) to examine inequities by population group specifically among those with disproportionate burden and 2) to dig deeply into ar eas of need most exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. The Secondary Data Work Group was instrumental in developing and providing feedback on list of data indicators, identifying potential data sources, and making connections to those sources. The secondary data work group began their work of reviewing the indicator list from the 2019 CHNA. These indicators were identified through multiple methods - 1) review of existing, validated indicators for social, economic, and health issues; 2) multiple discussions with a 30 person secondary data work group to brainstorm gaps in the ini tial list: and 3) review and refinement of the longer indicator list among the work group and work group co -chairs to prioritize those indicators that were available, focused on upstream issues, could be tracked over time, and where there were significant inequities. The 2022 CHNA process started with this 2019 list and then further refined and prioritized for this report. The secondary data work group engaged in multiple discussions and prioritized indicators: that aligned with the 2019 priority areas; that COVID -19 had a disproportionate impact on, and/or where there were the greatest inequities by race/ethnicity, neighborhood, or other characteristics. Secondary Data Sources Numerous data sources were reviewed and included in the 2022 CHNA. Secondary data sources included U.S. Census/American Community Survey, vital statistics (birth/death records), hospital case mix data, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BBRFSS), BBRFSS COVID -19 Health Equity Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Addiction Services treatment data. Analyses All secondary data on birth and death records, BBRFSS, YRBS, and Acute Hospital Case Mix were analyzed by the Research and Evaluation Office of the Boston Public Health Commission. Other data were analyzed by the organizations cited in the data source. Analyses were conducted for frequencies (percentages) and rates (per 100,000 residents), where applicable . Confid ence intervals (or error bars in the figures) were calculated for survey data from the ACS and surveillance systems, such as the BBRFSS and YRBS. Statistical significance testing by sub -groups was conducted at p<0.05. Secondary data were included in t he main body of the CHNA report that were most relevant to the themes that emerged in the focus groups and interviews, that aligned with the CHIP priority areas, that COVID -19 had a disproportionate impact on, and where there were the most significant ineq uities by race/ethnicity, neighborhood, or other characteristics 51 Qualitative Data - Focus Groups and Interviews How Populations and Interviewees were Identified The Community Engagement Work Group identified one of its main goals as ensuring that diverse and historically underrepresented community voices are lifted throughout the CHNA -CHIP process using an equity framework. To that end, the Community Engagement work group conducted a thorough review of the 20 19 CHNA and identified areas where there were gaps in representation. Concerted efforts were made in the 2022 process to ensure that those voices were included (e.g., expanded engagement with residents of Chinatown and Boston's Chinese community.) Additi onally, e ach hospital involved their Community Benefit Advisory Committee (CBAC) in the process as well, which included engagement of stakeholders at the neighborhood level across a range of sectors. The l ist of population segments for focus groups and sta keholders were vetted through each CBAC and additional ideas were brainstormed where there were gaps. CBACs were also asked to identify neighborhoods and population segments most impacted by COVID -19 (e.g., essential workers). Focus group discussions wer e conducted with those who have been disproportionately burdened by social, economic, and health challenges including: youth and adolescents, older adults, persons with disabilities, low -resourced individuals and families, LGBTQI+ populations, racially/eth nically diverse populations and /or limited -English speakers (e.g., African American, Latino, Haitian, Cape Verdean, Vietnamese, Chinese) , immigrant and asylee communities, families affected by incarceration and/or violence, and veterans. Key informant int erviews were conducted with a cross -section of sectors to identify areas of action and perspectives on the community. These interviewees included leaders and staff from public health, health care, behavioral health, the faith community, immigrant services, housing organizations, economic development, community development, racial justice organizations, social service organizations, education, community coalitions, the business community, childcare centers, elected government offices, and others. Discus sion Guides and Process Members of the Community Engagement Work Group and their partners -- Boston Children's Hospital, John Snow Inc. on behalf of Beth Israel Medical Center and New England Baptist Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Wo men's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital Faulkner Hospital, Tufts Medical Center, East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, EASTIE Coalition at East Boston Neighborhood Center, Soccer without Borders, Veronica Robles Cultural Center, and Maverick Landing Community Services - conducted the focus groups and interviews. Members of the community engagement work group divvied up key informant interviews and focus groups that they conducted using a consistent guide which focused on community needs and strengths and particularly which aspects of life were most impacted by the pandemic. Each organization organized their own discussions and made slight variations to the guide where appropriate. Qualitative data were from 62 key informant community leaders across a range of sectors and 29 focus groups with 309 community residents. The selection process for both the qualitative and quantitative data were guided by the Collaborative's shared values of equity. Analysis Each organization that conducted the focus groups and interviews initially synthesized the data they collected. The organizations summarized key themes into a consistent template that identified 52 feedback from the discussions on the community strengths, im pact of COVID, priority health issues, factors that promote community health, barriers to healthy living, specific findings among the four priority areas (housing, financial security and mobility, behavioral health, and accessing services), and proposed id eas and recommendations for the future. Findings under each of these were summarized, along with notations among which sub -populations they mapped to. Additionally, the template provided space for organizations to pull out illustrative quotes. These summ aries were submitted to Health Resources in Action (HRiA), a non -profit public health organization, that helped support the analysis and development of the CHNA report. HRiA analyzed the qualitative summaries to identify common themes across population gro ups as well as unique challenges and perspectives identified by populations and sectors, with an emphasis on diving deep into the root causes of inequities. Frequency and intensity were key factors used for extracting main themes and sub -theme s, as well as its alignment with the Collaborative's focus on equity. Asset Mapping and Community Resources Leading up to the 2022 CH NA, most of the CHIP work groups (one per priority area: behavioral health, access to services, housing, and financial stability & mobi lity) developed a comprehensive resources list to identify where there were current resources and where there were gaps. This information guided which strategies were prioritized, how they were implemented, and which partners needed to be involved in the d iscussions. This information then informed the 2022 CH NA. Additionally, in the 2022 CHNA, 62 key informant community leaders in interviews and 309 community residents in 29 focus groups were asked about what they saw as the strengths and assets in their community. This feedback was synthesized in this report. 53 APPENDIX E.

North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative Community Needs Assessment Qualitative Themes Report Community Survey Survey results by municipality1 North Suffolk Themes from Qualitative Data Collection T he following themes were highlighted across focus groups and key informant interviews with participants in Chelsea, Winthrop, and Revere. The breakdown of themes provides insight into strengths that participants felt contribute to the health of their community , challenges that create barriers to community health, and participant suggestions to help alleviate these barriers. Strengths Assistance from First Responders/Municipal Assistance. Focus group participants in Winthrop discussed the dedication of first responders and municipal commitment to residents, citing examples where first responders were there to assist and provide care when necessary . C ommunity Resilience. Focus group participants and key informants described the resilience among residents, particularly in Chelsea ; despite trauma , tremendous need, and the COVID -19 pandemic, participants stated there is an \"i ncredible energy of resilience.\" When asked about the strengths of the community in Chelsea, one key informant stated , \"It keeps rising out of the ashes and continues to be reborn and rebuilt\", highlighting resilience seen in Chelsea. Resilience among community residents despite adversity was also a strength that was emphasized during qualitative data collection for the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA) in 2019. C ommunity Connectedness . Participants from Revere and Chelsea discussed the sense of collaboration in these two communities, stating that community partners often come together to collaborate with each other to provide resources to residents. Winthrop participants described a visible sense of community among residents. In addition, Revere youth focus group participants talked about the benefits of having a shared language and culture in the ir community , as many people are immigrants and/ or identify as Hispanic/ Latinx; youth said this is helpful because being able to speak Spanish wh en interacting with adults to obtain access to resources makes them feel more comfortable.2 Access to Transportation. Winthrop youth and senior focus group participants mentioned that having access to public transportation to travel around the community and to Boston was a strength. Youth stated that it was helpful to have the T close by and to have access to a T pass, and seniors mentioned having the Partners bus was hel pful for getting to appointments at M assachusetts General Hospital and East Boston Neighborhood Health Center in Winthrop. Chelsea f ocus group p articipants also described having access to the MBTA bus as a strength in the community. Focus group participants of the 2019 iCHNA also mentioned transportation was an asset in their communities. Small Town/City . Participants in Winthrop and Chelsea focus groups shared that being in a small community was a strength because of the opportunity to get to know local officials and staff, such as the superintendent of schools, and it was also helpful in terms of accessing services. Challenges Social Isolation Among Older Residents . The prevalence of social isolation was discussed in this community health needs assessment and the 2019 iCHNA. P articipants highlighted the rise of social isolation among seniors and residents who are confined at home. Participants shared that some residents may have needs that are not being met because of social isolation. Suggestions for I mprovement : o Collective efficacy among neighbors-residents work together to improve the neighborhood, which would further strengthen community connectedness. o Improve communication-use different methods outside of the Internet/online, and ensure communication is available in different languages, especially for residents with limited English proficiency. o Emphasize importance of face -to-face communication- participants stated there is a lack of personal tou ch during in-person appointments, particularly due to having a shorter amount of time with providers and feeling rushed. Participants also 3 stated that virtual visits with providers are helpful, but there are limitations because some things c annot be addressed during these visits. oImproving the ability to advocate for oneself at medical appointments -focus group participants in Winthrop stated this is a need in the community. S ense of Belonging in the Communit y. Participants described a reduced sense of belonging among immigrants because they are treated as \"less than\". One focus group participant stated that immigrants are afraid to access benefits they are entitled to because they believe \"the government will find and deport them\". Lastly, focus group participants noted that immigrants often worry about how they /their families will be treated and often need help advocating for themselves. Q uality and Availability of Employment Opportunities. Multiple participants emphasized the importance of receiving fair pay and having access to a safe work environment. Participants highlighted that economic stability would help alleviate multiple health issues; one participant stated, \"If [they have] access to good jobs that are well-paid, their mental health, food insecurity, and affordable health improve \". While discussing employment, participants described the stress families in Chelsea experience because residents often work multiple jobs to pay rent that continues to increase and to make ends meet. Participants also noted that while the pandemic has made people rethink about the quality of their work environment, residents do not have much choice in which jobs they will take and often take any job opportunity available to pay their bills. In addition, participants mentioned there is a vulnerability among undocumented residents,especially regarding wage theft ; one participant provided an example of residents not receiving pay for three months but continuing to show up to work every day. Regarding youth employment, youth focus group participants in Winthrop mentioned there are limited high paying jobs in their local area so it is necessary to travel outside of town to find a job, and it can be a long process for obtaining a work permit and other necessarypaperwork . Additionally, Winthrop youth noted the importance of having a high-quality work environment, with many participants saying they enjoy working with CASAbecause it is a nice work environment. Lastly, Revere youth participants said that jobs4 often have a lot of requirements that people may not always agree with , such as vaccine requirements , which may hinder access to job opportunities. Impact of Lack of School Funding, Trauma, and Stress on Youth . Several participants talked about issues pertinent to youth in their communities. Youth in Revere and Winthrop stated that there is n ot enough funding for schools , and as a result, there are no guidance counselors, not enough teachers, and large class sizes . In addition, Chelsea and Winthrop youth talked about being stressed because they do not have a break from managing schoolwork, jobs, and other demands, and Chelsea youth mentioned they do not have a place to just relax after school, such as a youth center. Additionally, participants highlighted the negative impact of growing up with trauma and how that contributes to people wanting to leave their community due to feeling uncomfortable. Lastly, youth focus group participants highlighted issues with bullying in school that were often unresolved and not adequately handled, which negatively impacts youth. Suggestions for Improvement : o Invest in youth through education and employment opportunities Youth in Winthrop suggested providing effective education on bullying, in addition to having clear and consistent policies that address bullying in schools. o Mentorship opportunities o Provide m ental health resources -participants stated that youth mental health needs in the community were currently not being addressed. o Uplift youth Impact of Racism and Negative Perceptions of Particular Racial & Ethnic Groups on Policy and Socialization. Participants highlighted the prevalence of structural racism as a barrier for many people of color and immigrants in the North Suffolk area , especially regarding access to healthcare. One participant mentioned that the health of Black and Brown communities is not prioritized, especially at the state level . In addition, participants noted that the policies currently in place negatively impact immigrants . Furthermore, youth participants talked extensively about racism and cultural appropriation. A participant stated they felt targeted at school, and participa nts noted that 5 Hispanic students specifically take certain tests that aim to demonstrate skill proficiency and measure \"how well the government is doing their job\"; one participant provided an example of a teacher automatically assum ing the participant needed papers in Spanish because the participant took a test for people learning English, instead of providing an option to have papers in English. Chelsea youth noted differential treatment of people due to skin color and/or race/ethnicity, especially in school. Youth said they hear n on-Black peers saying the n-word in school and that pretty much everyone says it without knowing the true context and history of the word; the use of the n-word by non-Black people seemed to upset youth focus group participants, as they felt it was not acceptable to say the n-word just because it is used in popular music. Youth in Chelsea also talked about seeing cultural appropriation in schools, as Black culture is perceived as a cool trend . Discrimination and lack of cultural sensitivity was a challenge mentioned in the 2019 iCHNA, where participants highlighted examples of discrimination due to language and cultural differences. Suggestions for Improvement: o Talk about racism in schools-Chelsea youth mentioned the lack of education their peers have regarding racism and the context behind the n-word. Representation and Inclusion. Several Chelsea participants emphasized the importan ce of seeing people who look like them rather than solely seeing people represented from the dominant racial/ethnic group in the community; for example , one youth stated, \"I'm not trying to say that it's a bad thing that Hispanics are mostly represented, but I feel like that's what the main priority is only because that's all they see.\" Chelsea youth talked about seeing a lot of support geared towards Hispanic people and felt that non -Hispanic people, especially Black people, should have more opportunities to feel included and supported. Chelsea youth also mentioned that people in the community often make assumptions about what people like or want based on seeing majority Hispanic representation . While diversity is recognized as a strength in North Suffolk, qualitative data suggests that some residents do not feel adequately represented or see n in their communities . One participant stated, \"We attempt to fight back and include voices, but with everything happening around them telling them they don't matter, too many of our residents don't want to speak up\". In addition, participants stated they do not feel that 6 community voices and lived experiences are uplifted and mentioned disenfranchisement . Participants in Winthrop also stated that people in the community often do not have th eir voices heard due to the lack of local coalitions. Suggestions for Improvement: o Invest in the political power of community members o Value contributions from community residents o Expand opportunities for community voices to be heard o Increase representation and inclusion of non- Hispanic residents o Build initiatives at the local level, then bring them to state/federal levels Toxins and Pollution in the Environment . Participants, particularly in Chelsea and Winthrop, pointed out the impact of toxins and pollutions on air quality in their communities. Winthrop participants talked about the effects of the airport and community concerns about cancer. Participants in Chel sea, including youth, talked about an increase in vehicular traffic and cars, and highlighted the frequency of construction in the community as well, which has also negatively impacted air quality. Environmental concerns were flagged as a challenge in 2019 iCHNA, especially regarding the airport and air pollution. Suggestions for Improvement : o Implement state policy around environmental justice, air quality, and green space o Implement regulations on air pollution Lack of Physical /Open Space . Participants stated that the condition of parks in their communities impacted their health; litter and cleanliness of parks and outdoor areas w ere highlighted in a couple of focus groups and interviews. Revere and Chelsea youth mentioned there is a lot of drug/substance use, violence, and trash in parks; as a result, people do not feel safe in the park due to the negative connotation. One participant stated, \"It just gave us and our parents the ideology like 'Oh don't go to that place. It's not a safe place. Only bad people go ther e\". 7 Suggestion for Improvement: o Increase green spaces and parks- overall, Chelsea participants expressed the need for increased availability of open spaces and clean air, as well as more parks. Low Housing Stock and Poor Housing Conditions. Multiple participants stated there is a need for safe and affordable housing in their communities . Participants shared there is a lack of stability regarding housing and a threat of displacement due to private housing options. In addition, one participant mentioned there is a shift from owner-occupied units to investor-owned properties, which has negatively impacted the quality of housing conditions. Rising costs of rent and utilities was also described as a concern, as well as issues with overcrowding, as multiple people are sharing one bedroom and bathroom. One participant described how difficult it is to buy a house in the neighborhood, as buildings are bought by large companies : \"I can see all the big buildings around my house and know I can't afford them and it's not family friendly. I want to buy a house and it is very hard to buy a house and there is no program that we can apply for ...We are fighting to be here\". Lastly, participants noted that limited state and local policies, such gaps in rental assistance were unhelpful. Housing conditions and availability w ere also highlighted as a challenge during 2019 iCHNA data collection. Vaping in School Bathrooms. Revere and Winthrop youth discussed the increase of vaping, particularly in the school bathrooms. Youth in Revere noted that vaping is increasing among freshmen. The increase in vaping has negatively affected the ability to use school bathrooms, as youth are occupying the stalls to use vapes, and youth stated that vaping is unhealthy because of the smell and smoke in the lungs. Youth shared that some of the school bathrooms were closed because of vaping, and the bathrooms that remained open were in inconvenient locations. Revere youth mentioned that peers know where to get vapes because t here is a trading system. In addition, youth felt that even if vapes are taken away from their peers, they will still find a way to use them . One participant stated that youth did not discuss vaping with their family members, which suggests that this may contribute to ongoing use. Revere youth stated there is a low perception of harm with vaping, as their peers see it as less dangerous than smoking cigarettes . Despite knowing the damages vaping may have on their bodies, youth shared 8 that their peers continue to use vapes, possibly to look cool. In addition, youth said they see influencers smoking while telling other people not to smoke, which is ineffective. Suggestion for Improvement : o Have someone outside of the bathroom to monitor vaping use o Put in more smoke detectors Impact of Limited Mental Health Supports . Focus group participants and key informants highlighted an overwhelming need for mental health services, as many people are grappling with unresolved mental health issues d ue to loss, trauma, and stress. In addition, participants mentioned that l ow reimbursement rates impact services and lead to low salaries , resulting in people leav ing the field when there are a limited n umber of providers as it is . Furthermore, participants talked about the system being complex and complicated to navigate, which affects access to services. Concerns around mental health issues and limited services were also highlighted in the 2019 iCHNA. Suggestions for Improvement : o Additional mental health services/practitioners o Prioritize b ehavioral health needs, and potentially utilize people from non- clinical fields to assist, such as community health worker s o Expand access to mental health services through places/programs residents already utilize, such as faith-based programs o Build skills among residents to cope with stressors Impact of P olitics on Residents. Participants highlighted healthcare inequities and issues with communication due to a lack of effective policies at the local level. In addition, participants stated that public health has been politicized. Focus group participants also noted that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been politicized, particularly regarding masks and vaccines . Participants shared frustration with a lack of effective policies for pertinent issues, especially those that disproportionately affect certain groups. For example , a Chelsea participant mentioned there is no willingness to put money into resources for immigrants and policies affecting immigrants; participants shared this sentiment regarding environmental justice policies as well. In addition, participants stated that focusing on a regional approach rather than a local approach has 9 hindered residents because resources are limited. Lastly, Chelsea participants noted that people are interested and invested in making change, but there is no push to implement policies at th e local level . Quality and Frequency of Transp ortation. Although access to transportation is a strength, public transportation is also seen as dated and overcrowded. In addition, participants described the challenge of transportation schedules. Seniors in Winthrop said that although the Partners bus is helpful for getting to appointments, it runs on a limited schedule. In addition, participants in Chelsea talked about the infrequent schedule of the buses, as one participant shared that their mom had to wait three hours for a bus and missed a job interview as a result . Transportation was also mentioned as both a strength and challenge in the 2019 iCHNA. Suggestions for Improvement : o Partners bus could run on a more frequent schedule o Offer free/low -cost public transportation for students and residents with limited resources North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative Community Survey The North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative (NSPHC) is conducting a Community Health Assessment to explore the community health strengths and challenges that matter most to people in our communities - Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop.

Implementation Strategy 2 | Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Implementation StrategyAbout the 2022 Hospital and Community H e alth N eeds A ss essment Process Be th Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) is one of th e nation's preeminent academic medical centers and is na tionally recognized for its world-class clinical expertise, ed ucation and research. The medical center is also a Level 1 trauma center with a full range of medical/surgical, critical ca re, OB/GYN, and emergency services, and an extensive n etwork of primary care and ou tpatient specialty care practices. BIDMC prides itself on its ability to combine ex ceptional, compassionate patient care with advanced medical knowledge, research, and technology in ways th at allow it to achieve the best outcomes for its patients. BI DMC, in partnership with the BILH system, is committed to providing the very best care and strives to improve the health of the people and families in their service area. The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and planning work for this 2022 report was conducted between September 2021 and September 2022. In conducting this assessment and planning process, it would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to community engagement and a comprehensive, data-driven, collaborative and transparent assessment and planning process. Altogether, this approach involved extensive data collection activities, substantial efforts to engage the medical center's partners and community residents, and thoughtful prioritization, planning, and reporting processes. Special care was taken across all the assessment's individual components to include the voices of community residents who are often left out of health assessments like this one, such as those who are unstably housed or homeless, who do not speak English, who are recent immigrants, who are in substance use recovery, or who experience barriers and disparities due to their race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, or other p ersonal c haracteristics. BIDMC collects a wide range of quantitative data to ch aracterize the communities served across its Community Be nefits Service Area (CBSA). BIDMC also gathered data to h elp identify leading health-related issues, barriers to acce ssing care, and service gaps. Whenever possible, data was collected for specific geographic, demographic, or socioeconomic segments of the population to identify disparities and clarify the needs for specific communities. The data was tested for statistical significance whenever possible and compared against data at the regional, Commonwealth, and national level to support analysis and the prioritization process. Authentic community engagement is critical to assessing community needs, identifying the leading community hea lth priorities, prioritizing segments of the population most at-risk, and crafting a collaborative, evidence-informed IS. BIDMC employed a variety of strategies to help ensure that community members were informed, consulted, involved, and empowered throughout the assessment process. Across all four components, the assessment included 85 one-on-one interviews with key collaborators in the community, 22 focus groups with segments of the population facing the greatest health-related disparities, and community listening sessions that engaged 226 participants. Prioritization and Implementation Strategy Process Federal and Commonwealth community benefits guidelines require a nonprofit hospital to rely on their analysis of their CHNA data to determine the community health issues and priority cohorts on which it chooses to focus its Implementation Strategy (IS). By analyzing assessment data, hospitals can identify the health issues that are particularly problematic and rank these issues in order of priority. This data can also be used to identify the segments of the community that face health-related disparities or are disproportionately impacted by systemic racism or other forms of discrimination. Accordingly, using an interactive, anonymous polling software, BIDMC's CBAC and community residents, through the community listening sessions, formally prioritized the community health issues and cohorts that they believed should be the focus of BIDMC's IS. This prioritization process helps to ensure that BIDMC maximizes the impact of its community benefits resources and its efforts to improve health status, address disparities in health outcomes and promote health equity. The process of identifying the hospital's community health issues and prioritized cohorts is also informed by a review and careful reflection on the Commonwealth's priorities set by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Determination of Need process and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office. BIDMC's IS is designed to address the underlying social determinants of health and barriers to accessing care, as well as promote health equity. The content addresses the leading community health priorities, including activities geared toward health education and wellness (primary Implementation StrategyBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Implementation Strategy | 3prevention), identification, screening, referral (secondary prevention) and disease management and treatment (tertiary prevention). The following goals and strategies are developed so that they: Address the prioritized community health needs and/orpopulations in the hospital's CBSA. Provide approaches across the up-, mid-, anddownstream spectrum. Are sustainable through hospital or other funding. Leverage or enhance community partnerships. Have potential for impact. Contribute to the systemic, fair and just treatment of allpeople. Are flexible to respond to emerging community needs. Recognizing that community benefits planning is ongoing and will change with continued community input, BIDMC's IS will evolve. Circumstances may change with new opportunities, requests from the community, community and public health emergencies and other issues that may arise, which may require a change in the IS or the strategies documented within it. BIDMC is committed to assessing information and updating the plan as needed. Community B enefits S er vice A rea BIDMC's CBSA does not include a contiguous set of geographic c ommunities. R ather, p er federal r equirements, it i s defined as the cities and towns that are part of the Community Care Alliance and/or where BIDMC operates licensed facilities. BIDMC's CHNA focused on identifying the l eading communi ty health needs and priority cohorts liv ing and/or working within its CBSA. The activities that wil l be implemented as a result of this assessment will sup port all the people who live throughout the CBSA. In recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities in its CBSA, BIDMC focuses the bul k of its community benefits resources on improving the h ealth status of those who face health disparities, e xp erience poverty, or who have been historically und erserved, living in the city of Chelsea and the Boston nei ghborhoods o f Allston/Brighton, B ow doin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, Mission Hill and Roxbury. While BIDMC operates licensed facilities in Burlington, Nee dham and Peabody, these service locations are in oth er BILH CBSAs. The Town of Burlington and the City of Pea body are located within Lahey Hospital and Medical Center's (LHMC) CBSA and the Town of Needham is loc ated within Beth Israel Deaconess-Needham's (BID Nee dham) CBSA. As a result, the community benefits activities for these municipalities have been formally del egated to LHMC and BID Needham to ensure that a ctivities are properly coordinated and address the identified n eeds. 4 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Implementation StrategyPrioritized Community Health Needs and Cohorts BIDMC is committed to promoting health, enhancing access and delivering the best care for those in its CBSA. Over the next three years, the medical center will work with its community partners, with a focus on Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods in its CBSA, to develop and/or continue programming to improve well-being and create a healthy future for all individuals and families. In recognition of the health disparities that exist for certain segments of the population, investments and resources will focus on improving the health status of the following priority cohorts and community health priority areas. BIDMC Priority CohortsCommunity Health Needs Not Prioritized by BIDMC It is important to note that there are community health needs that were identified by BIDMC's assessment that were not prioritized for investment or included in BIDMC's IS. Specifically, addressing the digital divide (i.e., promoting equitable access to the internet) and supporting education across the lifespan were identified as community needs but were not included in BIDMC's IS. While these issues are important, BIDMC's CBAC and senior leadership team decided that these issues were outside of the medical center's sphere of influence and investments in other areas were both more feasible and likely to have greater impact. As a result, BIDMC recognized that other public and private organizations in its CBSA, Boston, and the Commonwealth were better positioned to focus on these issues. BIDMC remains open and willing to work with community residents, other hospitals, and other public and private partners to address these issues, particularly as part of a broad, strong collaborative. Community Health Needs Addressed in BIDMC's IS The issues that were identified in the BIDMC CHNA and are addressed in the hospital IS are housing issues, food insecurity, transportation, environmental justice/climate, economic insecurity, community safety, workforce development, small businesses, build capacity of healthcare workforce, navigation of healthcare system, linguistic access barriers, promotion/awareness of SDOH resources, diversify provider workforce, cost and insurance barriers, more peer-led services, addressing mistrust in healthcare, youth mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, isolation, impacts of violence & trauma, education (for communities, and for providers on how to best reach and treat them), stigma, racism (individual and systemic), culturally appropriate/competent health and community services, homophobia and transphobia, lack of education around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), diversifying leadership, cross sector collaboration and responses, and linguistic access/barriers to community resources/services.

Many of these barriers were at the system level, meaning that the issues stem from the way in which the system does or does not function. System level issues included providers not accepting new patients, long wait lists, and an inherently complicated healthcare system that is difficult for many to navigate. There were also individual level barriers to access and navigation. Individuals may be uninsured or underinsured, which may lead them to forego or delay care. Individuals may also experience language or cultural barriers - research shows that these barriers contribute to health disparities, mistrust between providers and patients, ineffective communication, and issues of patient safety.Resources/Financial Investment: BIDMC will commit direct, community health program investments, and in-kind resources of staff time and materials. BIDMC will also generate leveraged funds through grants from public and private sources on behalf of its own programs or services as well as on behalf of its community partners, such as the community health centers that are part of the Community Care Alliance, the health center network affiliated with Beth Israel Lahey Health and BIDMC.

These conditions influence and define quality of life for many segments of the population in the CBSA. Research shows that sustained success in community health improvement and addressing health disparities relies on addressing the social determinants of health that lead to poor health outcomes and drive health inequities. The assessment gathered a range of information related to economic insecurity, education, food insecurity, access to care/navigation issues, and other important social factors. There is limited quantitative data in the area of social determinants of health. Despite this, information gathered through interviews, focus groups, survey, and listening sessions suggested that these issues have the greatest impact on health status and access to care in the region - especially issues related to housing, food security/nutrition, and economic stability. Resources/Financial Investment: BIDMC will commit direct, community health program investments, and in-kind resources of staff time and materials. BIDMC will also generate leveraged funds through grants from public and private sources on behalf of its own programs or services as well as on behalf of its community partners, such as the community health centers that are part of the Community Care Alliance, the health center network affiliated with Beth Israel Lahey Health and BIDMC.

To measure this outcome, grantees are using a version of the Adult Hope Scale (adapted by the American Psychological Association (APA)). There are six questions: three questions that measure Agency,or goal directed energy, and three questions that measure Pathways, or the planning to accomplish goals. Each question is scored on a scale of 1-8, from definitely false (1) to definitely true (8). The scores for all six questions can be summed to calculate a Hope score. Subscale scores for Agency and Pathways may also be calculated in or order to examine both dimensions of \"Hope\" independently. Specifically, the Agency and Pathways subscales are scored by summing the score (1-8) of three questions, out of a possible 24 each. The full Hope score is calculated by adding all 6 responses together out of 48.10 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: 2022 Implementation StrategyGoal: Enh ance the built, social, and economic environments where people live, work, play, and learn in order to improve health and quality-of-life outcomes.

The assessment identified specific concerns about the impact of mental health issues for youth and young adults, the mental health impacts of racism, discrimination, and trauma, and social isolation among older adults. These difficulties were exacerbated by COVID-19. In addition to the overall burden and prevalence of mental health issues, residents identified a need for more providers and treatment options, especially inpatient and outpatient treatment, child psychiatrists, peer support groups, and mental health services. Substance use continued to have a major impact on the CBSA; the opioid epidemic continued to be an area of focus and concern, and there was recognition of the links and impacts on other community health priorities, including mental health, housing, and homelessness. Individuals engaged in the assessment identified stigma as a barrier to treatment and reported a need for programs that address common co-occurring issues (e.g., mental health issues, homelessness).
