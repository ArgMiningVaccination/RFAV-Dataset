High Dose Vitamin C acts with many mechanisms such as creating high amounts of H2O2 around the tumor cells making them inactive, reducing the blood flow to the cancer cells so reducing their nutrition which makes it difficult for the cancer cells to thrive and finally regulating the excess division rate of the cancer cells. The use of the High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C and Cancer is well known for several decades, with a success in some types of cancer at certain stages. There was a long debate about the effectiveness and usefulness as well the safety of using the High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C and Cancer, however, a recent research in 2018 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6115501/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6115501/) looked into that, and the researchers answered almost all these questions. To have a detailed information of this research, you can click on the link in the previous paragraph, but for conclusion, the findings of this research were all positive with a proof of the safety of the High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C and the lack of any evidence of the negative interaction between the High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C and different treatment modalities such as Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy The dose of the High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C and the frequency are to be determined by your treating doctor, they depend on many factors such as the extent and stage of the cancer, type of cancer and the patient's general condition or overall performance state.
