DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (cont'd) Office of Procurement and Support Services Fund Source: 100% Federal Remarks: Nature of Emergency - COVID-19: On March 5, 2020, Governor Larry Hogan issued a Declaration of State of Emergency and Existence of Catastrophic Health Emergency due to the outbreak of a severe respiratory disease, resulting in illness or death that is caused by the person -to-person spread of the novel coronavirus. The Maryland Department of Health issued a request for proposals to engage a communications firm to develop and execute a statewide, multi -platform communications campaign to inform and educate the public about critical topics related to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. The public must be informed about developments on multiple issues related to the pandemic, including the availability of testing, need to wear face coverings in public places, continued social distancing, isolating when sick, and coop erating with contact tracers. Future topics will include efforts to prevent a \"second wave\" of infections and repercussions should there be a second wave and urging the public to get vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available. These topics align directly with the Governor's \"building blocks\" for Maryland's continued recovery and reopening. As this pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis, Marylanders will need regular, accurate and reliable information and guidance about symptoms, exposure, testing, self -isolation, quarantine and other topics. The campaign will need to address potential cultural differences across urban, suburban and rural settings and among residents of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Significant and sustained outreach is needed to achieve these goals. The expected duration of this campaign is 6 months and messaging across multiple platforms will begin in late July. Basis for Selection: The evaluation team determined the awarded vendor's proposal to be the most advantageous to the State based on the merits of its technical proposal. Reason for Late Reporting: Administrative delays resulted in this report being submitted after the 45- day required reporting period.

Original Contract Term (s): 10/08/2015 - 12/16/2021 ( all four (4) contracts) 45 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 MDOT 2 1-AE-MOD.

The c urrent contracts will expire on December 16, 2020. The procurement process for the new services has been started, however, due to restrictions imposed by Covid- 19, the procurement process has been delayed and is not expected to be completed until Fall 2021. To ensure continuity of services to existing assigned work orders and services with current consultant resources and to continue funding for other critical existing on- going work orders, this modification is deemed essential. The planned project delivery schedules for design completion, advertisement support, and construction phase administration services for current projects would be disrupted and cause delays in fiscal year CTP committed spending as well as potential risk for failure of critical infrastructure equipment. 46 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 MDOT 3 1-AE-MOD. MARYLAND TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (cont'd) Requesting Agency Remarks (cont'd): Through delegated authority, the MDOT MDTA issued Modification #1 to contracts AE-3011-0000 and AE-3012-0000 for a 70-day extension to align all four (4) contracts for the same expiration date. The MBE compliance reflects the percentage of MBE subconsultants that were paid to date. It does not reflect MBE funds that were allocated for work orders with the work and subsequent invoicing pending. Contract AE-3014- 0000 has the majority of the MBE funds allocated, however since the contract was awarded in 2015 a major MBE subconsultant is no longer an MDOT certified MBE firm and the remaining funds are in the process of being transferred to another MBE firm within the contract.

MARYLAND PORT ADMINISTRATION Service Contract Contract Reuse of Dredged Material; 220005D-S ADPICS No: P220005D Contract Description : This contract provides for a study and demonstration of the feasibility of using dredged material from the Cox Creek Dredged Material Containment Facility (DMCF) in the development of concrete traffic barriers and shoreline protection structures.

MBE Participation : 100% Requesting Agency Remarks : This Request for Proposals (RFP) was advertised by the Maryland Department of Transportation Maryland Port Administration (MDOT MPA) on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage, which notified approximately 2,367 vendors. MDOT MPA also shared the solicitation with the Maryland Minority Contractors Association and the Md. Washington Minority Companies Association and directly solicited 240 companies. In an effort to significantly expand the State of Maryland's dredged material reuse efforts and 48 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 MDOT 5 2-S. MARYLAND PORT ADMINISTRATION (cont'd) Requesting Agency Remarks (cont'd): long- term containment facility capacity, MDOT MPA solicited sealed proposals for applied research and development projects to explore feasible means for reuse of material dredged from Baltimore Harbor channels and placed in the Cox Creek DMCF. The RFP defi nes \"reuse\" as the recycling of dredged material for use in another product or application, including residential, recreational, commercial, and industrial uses. Contracts issued under this procurement will support MDOT MPA's research and development of dr edged material applications to further the State's efforts to recover capacity and/or extend the lifespan of the Cox Creek DMCF. Successful results of this research and development effort could lead to MPA developing a separate, longer -term contract (or contracts) for the reuse of significant volumes of dredged material. These efforts will give MDOT MPA an opportunity to understand better the potential for large -scale, long -term cost - effective capacity recovery in the DMCF. As a result of contracts resul ting from this RFP, MDOT MPA will be evaluating lessons learned, adaptive management approaches, and scalability with an eye on future opportunities to recover capacity in DMCFs. The RFP provides that there is no fixed deadline for submission of proposals until MDOT MPA establishes a deadline by published amendment to the solicitation. Instead, proposals may be submitted at any time and may be considered for award at any time, even while other proposals may be under consideration. Proposals are not in direct competition with each other. No award may exceed $300,000 in price. MDOT MPA currently has a budget of $2 million for all contracts awarded under the RFP, which will allow for a minimum of six contracts to be awarded under this solicitation. Northgate Environmental Management, Inc. submitted a proposal to demonstrate the feasibility of using dredged material from Cox Creek DMCF in concrete traffic barriers manufactured by LafargeHolcim, a major materials manufacturer, and modular shoreline protection s tructures manufactured using 3D printing technology of Natrx, Inc. The contractor will procure a small quantity of dewatered dredged material generated from Cox Creek DMCF, combine it with other materials into various mixtures to develop conventional and 3D- printed concrete structures, under controlled and documented circumstances to demonstrate engineering and environmental suitability, and will provide the results to MDOT MPA. If the project is successful, the result could be a separate, long -term contrac t with MPA under which dewatered dredged material from Cox Creek DMCF could be used in the development of upland and in- water concrete products to provide coastal stabilization and support for local transportation projects, thereby expanding the commercial viability of dredged sediments and cost -effectively recovering valuable capacity in the DMCF. MDOT MPA has received nine proposals to date. On September 23, 2020 (Item 11- S) the Board approved an award to Belden -Eco Products, Inc., in the amount of $298,061 to test the use of dredged material in the production of ceramic bricks and permeable pavers. Five other proposals are still being considered and additional proposals may be received before MDOT MPA closes the 49 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 MDOT 6 2-S. MARYLAND PORT ADMINISTRATION (cont'd) Requesting Agency Remarks (cont'd): procurement. Two proposals were found to be not reasonably susceptible of being selected for award, one because the proposal offered consulting services in the management of the DMCF rather than a reuse of dredged material and the other due to inability to agree on contract terms. This award was approved by the Maryland Port Commission on November 2, 2020. Fund Source : 100% Special Funds (Transportation Trust Fund) Approp.

Currently MDSP -FSD can only detect the presence of THC but can't quantify the amount present and the laboratory is not able to differentiate between hemp and marijuana . Outsourcing marijuana cases to a laboratory that can quantify THC is the only option for cases that need to specify the amount for prosecution. Although MSP and the Office of State Procurement have worked together to write the new solicitation, the COVID- 19 pandemic has delayed the efforts to complete and advertise the contract.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODIFICATION (cont'd) Requesting Agency Remarks: To increase the base time and material amount for the remainder of year two (2) and three (3), by $20,000,000 from $8,922,751.50 to $28,922,751.50. DoIT furnishes services under this Contract to other Requesting Agencies via Task Orders issued by the State. The Task Orders issued on behalf of the Requesting Agencies are managed as a staffing model on a labor rate basis, either on an hourly or annualized basi s. At the time the Financial Proposals associated with the solicitation were being reviewed, the evaluation was based on the sum total of two components - the MDOT Capacity Management scope of work, which represented the first Task Order against the cont ract, and a T&M component which applied estimates of hours expected to meet the above staffing model demand multiplied by the proposed labor rates. The estimated hours used during the solicitation were based on hours supported under a similarly scoped contract (F50B5400037 - Network Managed Services). As the Evaluation Panel (\"Panel\") evaluated the Financial Proposal submitted by DMI, the Panel noted that the labor rates proposed by DMI were materially less than the other five Offerors. In aggregate, based on the aforementioned T&M component of the solicitation, they were 12.3% less than their Offeror ranked 2 nd financially and 32% less than the 6th ranked Offeror. The degree to which these rates were lower was noted by the Panel as a potential concern. Specifically the concern was whether or not labor with the required experience and skills could be provided at the rates proposed. The Panel ultimately decided to move forward with awarding DMI based on 1) the recommendations received from other parties using this vendor, 2) the strength of the technical proposal, and 3) the financial proposal being in the best interest of the State. As a result of the aforementioned concerns, DoIT did not modify the previous estimates of demand to reflect any demand stimulation from the lower rates Since inception of the contract, DoIT has issued numerous Task Orders for staff supporting a variety of different IT projects (20 in total) and agencies. Presently, DMI has demonstrated that they are capable of providing the resour ces requested at the prices proposed and feedback from the agencies has been extremely positive. As a result, DoIT now sees demand far in excess of what was originally projected. Additionally, since the award of the contract, DoIT has decided to: 1)) migrate its current Security Operations functions from the previously mentioned Network Managed Services (NMS) provider; 2) remove that scope from the re -compete of the NMS contract (currently awaiting issuance), and; 3) begin using staff augmentation to bring these critical Security Operations functions in house. DoIT evaluated DMI's rates for security resources and determined the State would achieve a savings of 37% - 52% compared to two comparably scoped contracts currently in place. REVISED 96OSP 31 DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OFFICE OF STATE PROCUREMENT ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 21-IT-MOD. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODIFICATION (cont'd) DMI's competence as it relates to network security functions has been reinforced by two projects, one for MDOT and one for MDH, which demonstrates their ability to provide resources for critical security projects. In summary, the additional $20M in funding requested is the result of: our tempering our original demand estimates based on concerns with rates, the decision to migrate critical Security functions in house, and the fact that DMI has demonstrated its ability to provide quality resources and services at prices well below alternatives available.

The NASPO ValuePoint alliance aggregates the demand of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the organized US territories. There are currently 151 (Participating Addenda) PAs remaining against this Lead State Master Contracts (Nevada) for wireless services and equipment, and six available vendors participating. This cumulative purchasing power, as well as multi -state and locality volume buying, results in more favorable rates than the State would otherwise obtain by contracting directly with these vendors. The current Master Contracts with the Lead State were slated to end on December 31, 2019; however, the contracts for the four providers with whom Maryland holds PAs were extended until 12/31/2020 to allow participating States to transition onto the new NASPO Master Contract for Wireless Data, Voice and Accessories (2019 -2024) . REVISED 99OSP 34 DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OFFICE OF STATE PROCUREMENT ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 22-IT-MOD. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODIFICATION (cont'd) Agency Remarks (cont'd): The current request for $2,439,299 to support the remaining two months represents a reasonable estimate based on usage of the contract during calendar year 2019 as compared to 2020 year -to- date. POs drawn again st the current contract BPO (060B3490004) are diverse in terms of awarded value, as usage varies greatly amongst user Agencies and Departments. The State has an overall spend of approximately $7.2M from January to June of this year, which represents a 40% increase in spend from 2019. Based on current spend- to-date, the rising usage year over previous year s of the contract and the increase in usage due to a hybrid in office/remote office work environment, the $30,200,000 ceiling was exceeded during the requested period. As such, $2,439,299 represents the minimum amount the Department estimates should be added to the contract to cover potential costs through December 31, 2020.

Services include distributing information packets to individuals who have contacted the Call Center (the Call Center Customer). These call -center services allow agencies to enhance customer service to citizens through a toll- free number, and in some cases sending emails to a general email account. Under the call -center arrangement, citizens reach an answering point located in Maryland that is staffed between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM Monday through Friday, except for State holidays. In addition, citizens are provided some information 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

The retroactive funding cover expenditures under the current contract placed during the time period of July through November.

REAL PROPERTY Department of Services File # 00-8595 Recommendation: Declare surplus 8.157 +/- acres for an Easement Agreement. Property: 8.157 acres located on the Springfield Hospital Campus Prior Approval: DGS 41 -RP, August 5, 1998 Grantor: The State of Maryland, to the use of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Health Grantee: Carroll County Background: The BPW approved item 41-RP on August 5, 1998, which authorized the grant of a Right of Entry; Water, Utility and Supply Agreement; and an Easement Agreement for Carroll County to obtain water production sources at Springfield Hospital Center. The Right of Entry was executed in October, 1998, and the County designed and constructed a well system which includes ten well sites. Five of the sites are observation wells, and five are potential production wells. Approximately $400,000 was spent by the County for the engineering, design, and construction of the wells on the Springfield campus from 1998 - 2004. In July 2005, Carroll County submitted a request to DGS for approval of permanent easements for access to the wells at Springfield Hospital Center, and permanent easements to construct the necessary infrastructure to draw water from the wells. For reasons unclear to DGS (due to the passage of time and the retirement of key personnel) no action was taken regarding the easement request. In 2015, Carroll County approached DGS to renew their request for the previously approved well easements. DGS advised the County that the 1998 BPW approval would need to be renewed, due to the length of time since the approval was granted. Since 2015, DGS and the County have worked through the necessary requirements for the well easements including the County obtaining surveys and appraisals and DGS coordinating the Clearinghouse review. The County now desires to put the wells into production in order to add redundancy to the public water system, provide water security, to create cost stabilization, and to minimize its future dependence on the Baltimore City water supply. An estimated 8.157 +/- acres have been requested for easements to provide access to the well sites, construction, maintenance, repair, and utilization of the necessary infrastructure to draw water from the wells. While the underlying fee simple ownership of the property will remain with the State , surplus approval for the easement area is being requested to facilitate the County's use of the site for the wells constructed on the Springfield campus 119OSP 54 DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OFFICE OF STATE PROCUREMENT ACTION AGENDA November 18, 2020 30-RP. REAL PROPERTY (cont'd) Clearinghouse: The Clearinghouse conducted an intergovernmental review of the project under MD20180727-0631. It is recommended to grant the easement located on the grounds of Springfield Hospital Center for the purpose of accessing water wells located on the campus.

SERVICES MODIFICATION (cont'd) Requesting Agency Remarks: Request for approval to modify the contract to add additional funding to the existing contract term . This modification is required to prevent an interruption of services due to lack of funding. This fund increase will permit services to continue into January 2021, at which time it is anticipated that a new sole source contract with this contractor will be entered into to provide continuity of operations. The supply chain management and logistical support provided by this contract have become an integral part of the State's COVID -19 pandemic response. All field hospital operations would be severely disrupted if this contractor were to cease services. In addition to sourcing consumable medical supplies, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), durable medical equipment, and providing supply chain management, this contract also includes materials management and logistical support, laundry and bed linen services, oxygen services, and envi ronmental services. This contract covers seven sites; three field hospitals that were created to expand available bed capacity to the general public, two 16 bed modular intensive care units, and field hospital operations at the Jessup and Hagerstown correc tional sites. The continued success of Maryland's pandemic response depends on the effective management of the field hospitals that increase the number of both critical care and subacute beds, which helps ensure that Maryland will never exceed available hospital bed capacity. Maintaining these field hospitals requires outside expertise that is in extremely high demand due to the ongoing pandemic. The spend rate of this emergency contract has exceeded initial projections due to higher than anticipated usage. A new contract with this same contractor to continue field hospital support operations for the duration of the pandemic will be presented to the Board of Public Works in early 2021.
