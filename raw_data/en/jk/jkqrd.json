MAKE AN APPOINTMENT Welcome to Alternative Health Management Do you feel like you have just been treating symptoms without ever getting to the root cause of the problem? Has modern medicine failed to uncover the cause of your problem or help you find relief? Our Houston holistic doctors are committed to finding and treating the underlying cause of the problem, rather than merely treating the symptoms. Our team of chiropractors and functional medicine doctors begin by investigating your symptoms and health history to uncover the root cause of your symptoms. Often, symptoms that seem to be unrelated have a single root cause. We use many methods to evaluate our patients, including taking a thorough health history, comprehensive nutritional analysis, laboratory tests, and other testing. The tests that are conducted depend on the information discovered in the initial evaluation. Our natural health clinic treats patients with a broad range of symptoms, including hormone imbalances, low back pain, headaches, issues with digestive health in Houston, and many other problems. We use the information from the consultation and testing to create a treatment protocol that is customized to your specific needs. This may include nutritional counseling, chiropractic adjustments, herbal and homeopathic therapies, and many other treatments. The specific treatment plan and length of treatment vary, according to the specific needs of each patient. The first step is to visit our clinic for a consultation to evaluate your symptoms and treatment needs.
