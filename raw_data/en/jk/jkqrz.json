People at higher risk The Highest Risk List - previously known as the Shielding List - has ended. However, there are still people whose weakened immune system means they are at higher risk from infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Read [guidance for people with a weakened immune system](https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/pages/guidance-for-immunosuppressed-people/). Travel Travelling to Scotland from abroad There are no COVID-19 travel rules in place for people arriving in Scotland from abroad. You do not need to: - complete a Passenger Locator Form - take any tests before you leave for Scotland, or after you arrive - isolate when you arrive Travelling abroad from Scotland If travelling abroad from Scotland [check travel advice for the country you are going to](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). COVID-19 vaccination for travel is only available if you're traveling to a country that requires proof of coronavirus vaccination for entry and you do not have the number of doses required. There are very few countries in the world that require proof of COVID status to enter. Most countries have no requirements at all, and some will allow you to enter if you take a coronavirus test prior to travel. If you need a coronavirus vaccine, please contact your local health board to discuss your circumstances. If you need to prove which vaccinations you've had when you arrive in another country, you can normally use your [NHS Scotland COVID Status app](https://www.nhsinform.scot/nhs-scotland-covid-status) to do this.
