The important point to remember about kapha types is that they have a naturally lower body temperature and, in order to encourage the processes of cleansing and detoxification, they need a bit of heat. So, while foods consumed during a cleanse should be simple and vegetable-based, they should be warm and spiced. Avoid the addition of any oils or dairy as these are especially hard for a kapha type to digest. Herbs and spices that keep kapha in check are those which are generally more heating and stimulating with the power to shift deep congestion. Think about adding herbs such as [ginger](/uk/en/wellbeing-articles/the-benefits-of-ginger-and-how-we-source-it), black pepper and [turmeric](/uk/en/wellbeing-articles/benefits-of-turmeric) into your meals. Favour herbal teas that will help stoke the digestive fire such as [After Dinner](/uk/en/products/after-dinner-tea), [Three Fennel](/uk/en/products/three-fennel-tea) and [Three Ginger](/uk/en/products/three-ginger-tea). During a cleanse, all three doshas should keep the diet simple, vegetable-based and dairy-free and reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. Keep exercise to a minimum and remember not to overdo it as your body will be working harder than usual at this time. Don't know your dosha? Take our [dosha](/uk/en/dosha-quiz) to find out.
