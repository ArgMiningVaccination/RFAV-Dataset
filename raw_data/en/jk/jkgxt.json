Smallpox vaccine is given using a two-pronged needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution and then used to prick the skin several times to deliver the vaccine into the shallow layers of skin. These needle sticks are not deep, but they will cause some soreness and minor bleeding. Smallpox vaccine usually is given in the skin of your upper arm. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting. Call your doctor at once if you have any unexpected skin changes or severe irritation or signs of infection where the needle stick was placed. Also call your doctor if you have an outbreak of skin sores or blisters anywhere on your body. Keep your vaccination sore covered at all times with a gauze bandage held in place with first aid tape, especially while the sore is draining pus. The bandage should allow air to flow through it to keep your vaccination sore dry. Change your bandage often to keep the sore clean and dry. Smallpox vaccine contains a live form of the virus, which can \"shed\" from your injection site. This means that after you receive the vaccine and until your scab falls off, your vaccination sore will be contagious and could spread the virus to anything or anyone who touches it. The virus can also spread to other parts of your body that come into contact with your vaccination sore. This period of contagion may last for up to 4 weeks after you received the vaccine. Do not apply ointments to the sore. Use a waterproof bandage to cover the sore while you are bathing. Apply a dry gauze bandage after bathing. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after touching your vaccination sore, changing your bandages, or handling clothing, towels, or other fabrics that have come into contact with your sore. A vaccination sore can transfer smallpox virus to bandages, clothing, bedding, towels, wash cloths, or furniture. Wear a shirt at all times to cover your vaccination sore while it is healing. Throw away used bandages in a sealed plastic bag placed in a garbage can that children and pets cannot reach. Do not allow anyone else to handle your used bandages. Do not share towels, clothing, or other personal items while your vaccination sore is healing. Get medical help if someone in your household shows any symptoms of smallpox, such as skin rash, fever, headache, or body aches. These may be signs that the virus has spread to that person or to something in the household that the person has touched. When your scab falls off, place it in a sealed plastic bag and throw it away. Wash your hands with soap and hot water afterward. This vaccine can cause false results on a skin test for tuberculosis. Tell any doctor who treats you if you have received a smallpox vaccine. "}
