Although Eleutherococcus senticosus is not related to true ginseng (Panax ginseng), the name Siberian ginseng became popular because the two plants shared some similar properties. - Use of Siberian ginseng may date back over 2,000 years in China. Traditionally, Siberian ginseng has been used as an adaptogen, a compound that increases one's ability to adapt to environmental factors, including physical and emotional stress. Overall, there is currently little clinical evidence on the use of Siberian ginseng for this purpose or to treat any medical condition in humans. - Siberian ginseng is called ci wu ju in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In TCM, Siberian ginseng is used to invigorate qi; strengthen the spleen; nourish the kidney; provide energy and vitality; and treat high blood pressure, inflammation, respiratory tract infections, ischemic heart disease, spasms, and hepatitis. In traditional Russian medicine, Siberian ginseng is used to stimulate the immune system. Shigoka, the Siberian ginseng rhizome, is a traditional medicine used as a tonic in northeastern Asia and far eastern Russia. It has also been used in traditional Korean medicine as a tonic and adaptogen to strengthen qi. Siberian ginseng is among the five adaptogens most commonly used by Western herbalists. - Siberian ginseng has been added to yogurt products. Eleutherosides, active components of Siberian ginseng, have withstood pasteurization. Siberian ginseng is also called \"eleuthero\" in some products. Scientific Evidence |Uses| These uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider. |Grade*| |Adaptogen| Siberian ginseng has traditionally been used as an adaptogen, a compound that increases one's ability to adapt to environmental factors, including physical and emotional stress. Studies have investigated the effect of Siberian ginseng on increasing energy, reducing fatigue, and on enhancing exercise performance. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Cancer| Siberian ginseng root has been suggested as part of a holistic approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that a combination therapy that includes Siberian ginseng may increase survival time in patients with advanced cancer. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Cognitive function| Preliminary evidence suggests that a combination product (containing Siberian ginseng, Rhodiola rosea, and Schisandra chinensis) improved cognitive function in females. Additional studies of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Diabetic foot ulcers| Preliminary evidence suggests that a combination therapy that contains Siberian ginseng had a beneficial effect on diabetic foot ulcers. Additional studies of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Exercise performance enhancement| Siberian ginseng has been traditionally used as an exercise performance enhancement agent. Results of clinical studies have been mixed. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Familial Mediterranean Fever| Preliminary research suggests that a combination product containing Siberian ginseng may reduce symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever. Further studies of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Fatigue| Preliminary research suggests that Siberian ginseng may reduce the severity and duration of fatigue in patients with less severe chronic fatigue syndrome. However, the results of other studies are not in agreement. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Genital herpes| Limited research suggests that Siberian ginseng may reduce the severity, duration, and frequency of outpeaks of genital herpes after three months of use. Further research is required before conclusions can be made. |C| |Immunomodulation| The effect of Siberian ginseng, alone and in combination with other herbal ingredients, has been investigated, with mixed results. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Influenza| Research suggests that a combination treatment containing Siberian ginseng may contribute to quicker recovery and reduce the risk of postinfluenza complications. Further studies on the effect of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Low blood pressure (neurocirculatory)| Preliminary data suggest that use of Siberian ginseng extract may increase blood pressure in individuals with neurocirculatory low blood pressure. Further evidence is required before conclusions can be made. |C| |Menopause| Preliminary research on a combination product containing Siberian ginseng suggests a lack of an effect on reducing menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. Further studies with Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Osteoarthritis| In patients with knee osteoarthritis, a combination product (containing Panax notoginseng, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Siberian ginseng) improved pain and physical function. Research on the effect of Siberian ginseng alone is needed. |C| |Osteoporosis| A combination therapy containing low-dose calcium, vitamin D3, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Siberian ginseng was more effective in treating decreasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women than high doses of calcium and vitamin D3 alone. Research on the effect of Siberian ginseng alone is needed. |C| |Pneumonia| Preliminary research suggests that use of a combination product containing Siberian ginseng may reduce the need for antibiotics in patients with pneumonia. Additional studies on the effect of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Quality of life| A small, preliminary study suggested that Siberian ginseng may not improve quality of life in the elderly. Additional research is needed in this area. |C| |Respiratory tract infections| Several studies suggest that some combination products that contain Siberian ginseng (including Kan Jang\u00ae and another product that also contains Andrographis) may reduce symptoms of respiratory tract infections in adults and children. Further studies of Siberian ginseng alone are needed. |C| |Bipolar disorder| Preliminary data suggest that Siberian ginseng, when used together with lithium, may be no more beneficial than fluoxetine in treating bipolar disorder in adolescents. Additional research is needed in this area. |D| Tradition/Theory The below uses are based on tradition, scientific theories, or limited research.
