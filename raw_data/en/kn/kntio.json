Q: Can crystals help with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)? A: Crystals such as carnelian and citrine stimulate vitality by increasing blood flow to all parts of the body. Carnelian promotes creativity while citrine offers confidence during times where CFS affects an individual's self-esteem. Q: Do I need to clean my crystals regularly? A: Cleansing your crystals regularly is important. The easiest way is through smudging - expose them in sage smoke or sunlight between 10 AM-2 PM every week at least once a month. Q: How long does it take for one to feel the effects of using crystals? A: Healing through crystal therapy is a gradual process, and the time it takes for you to feel its effect depends on the condition's nature. Patience and persistence are important in this process.
