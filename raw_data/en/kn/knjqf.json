HP is available to all ages and has been used for over 200 years. It is a safe alternative to conventional vaccines and is also provided to travelers to other countries, which may recommend certain vaccinations. Extensive worldwide clinical research shows that HP is comparably effective to conventional vaccines. Sonja is Certified in Homeoprophylaxis (CHP) and provides HP for children and adults of any age against targeted infectious diseases as an alternative to conventional vaccines. Sonja studied with Dr. Isaac Golden, who spearheaded HP worldwide and she attended both conferences held in the United States on HP. Vaccines The United States has the most aggressive vaccine schedule of any country in the world. Since 2015, the CDC has recommended that an infant of six months will have 24 doses of vaccines; an eighteen-month-old will have 35 doses; a six-year-old child will have 49 doses; and by the age of eighteen years, the child will have had 69 doses of vaccines. By the age of sixty-five, a person is scheduled to have 72 doses of vaccines; and by the age of eighty, 88 doses of vaccines, according to the CDC. By contrast, the Advisory Committee on Immunization in the United States (ACIP) scheduled 4 vaccines from 1945-1954 (Smallpox and DTP); 5 vaccines from 1955-1964 (Smallpox, DTP, and Polio); and 6 vaccines from 1965-1074 (Smallpox, DTP, Polio, and Measles). The MMR vaccine was licensed in 1971. On the other hand, in 2016, 1 in 68 children were identified with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the 1980s, this number was 1 in 10,000. We have seen an epidemic rise in autism, where ASD continues to be much more prevalent among boys than girls. It is five times more prevalent among boys. Vaccines contain chemicals, heavy metals, and animal by-products toxic to the body. According to the CDC and Informed Choice Vaccine Ingredients, the following are some of the substances contained in vaccines: formaldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, benzethonium, thimerosal, ammonium sulfate, polysorbate 80, formalin, a phenol-a compound obtained by distillation of coal, gelatin, vesicle fluid from calf skins, benzethonium chloride, glycerin, phenol, beta-propiolactone, continuous line of monkey kidney cells, mouse serum proteins, washed sheep RBCs, chick embryonic fluid and human diploid cells from aborted fetal tissue. Different vaccines contain different substances. With the ever-increasing use of vaccines, antibiotics and, other medications, OTC and prescription medications, we have seen a rise in immune system dysfunction and an increase in epidemics of chronic childhood disorders, such as Autism, Asthma, Allergies, and Eczema. Homeopathic Immunization: Homeoprophylaxis (HP) - Is safe - Is inexpensive - Has no side-effects - Contains no adjuvants - Is administered by mouth - Has been used since 1798 - Has no toxic ingredients - Is not contaminated with antibiotics, foreign DNA, and heavy metals, like mercury and aluminum - Can be given to persons of any age - Is prepared from nanoparticles of the disease and a small amount of sucrose. There is no single molecule of the disease in the remedy, only the energy signature of the disease. It may also be prepared from Classical Homeopathic Remedies of animal, mineral, or plant sources. Each remedy is prepared from only one source. A small amount of sucrose is the carrier. Liquid remedies are also available. - Clinical worldwide evidence shows that homeopathic immunization is comparably effective to vaccines, without the risk of toxic side effects. Extensive research trials have shown an effectiveness rate of about 90% for homeopathic immunizations. - The standard diseases covered are Pertussis, Pneumonia, Polio, Haemophilus Influenza, Meningitis, Tetanus, Mumps, and Measles. - For the traveler, protection from other diseases is also available.
