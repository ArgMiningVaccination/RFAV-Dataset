OSBORN CHAIR OF MOLECULAR & INTEGRAT IVE PHYSIOLOGY: Our department was once again the fortunate beneficiary of our long- time friend, Jim Osborn. No one has done more to help our department than Jim Osborn. Jim's generous new gift established the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair in support of the c hair position in the department. At an investiture ceremony held Wednesday, September 26th, 2012, Paul Cheney was installed as the inaugural Kathleen M. Osborn Chair of Molecular & Integrative Physiology. This was without doubt one of the proudest and most moving moments of his 40- year long career. Our deepest thanks and appreciation to Jim Osborn for his continued and unwavering support of our department. This endowed chair is in honor of Kathleen Osborn, daughter of Jim and Marion Osborn. Kathleen worked in Dr. Gil Greenwald's laboratory during the summers of 1968 and 1969 when she was a student at the University of Missouri, Columbia. This experience was particularly meaningful to Kathleen and might have motivated her to enter a career in science had she not been taken from us prematurely in automobile accident in 1970 . The generous gift of this endowed chair in memory of Kathleen and her excitement for science adds to several previous gifts from Jim Osborn and his wife Marion. Their generosity star ted with the Kathleen M. Osborn Lectureship in 1971. This lectureship remains as the longest running and most successful lectureship in the history of the medical center and has attracted a long list of preeminent scientists from around the world. Funds f rom the Kathleen Osborn lectureship have also supported the annual Gil S. Greenwald Symposium , which is now in its 10th year and every year draws a line up of big name speakers. Another major gift from the Osborn family established the Marion M. Osborn Pr ofessorship in memory of Jim Osborn's wife Marion. This professorship was established in 2006 and supports reproductive science in the department. The inaugural recipient and current Marion M. Osborn Professor is Dr. Leslie Heckert. Included below are photos shown as part of a presentation by the KU Endowment Association at the Kathleen M. Osborn investiture. The first panel includes photographs of Jim Osborn, his wife, Marion and their daughter Kathleen. The second panel shows photographs of the three department chairs who have had the pleasure of working with Jim Osborn and his family. Gil Greenwald was chair of the department from 1976 - 1993, Jim Voogt was chair from 1993 - 2001 and Paul Cheney has been chair from 2001 to the present. The third pa nel shows photographs of Jim Osborn taken soon after the investiture of Leslie Heckert as the Marion M. Osborn Professor. Note that Jim Osborn is also a proud and enthusiastic KU Jayhawk fan and enjoys sporting his KU Basketball National Championship T -shirt. The fourth panel includes a photograph of Paul Cheney with Jim Osborn taken in April of 2011 during a vacation trip Paul and his family made to Hawaii. It was a very memorable occasion and a great opportunity to meet Jim Osborn and thank him in pers on for his friendship and generosity to our department. The final panel is a news release from the KU Endowment Association announcing Jim Osborn's generous gift in creating the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair of Molecular & Integrative Physiology. 1 Slides p resented at the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair Investiture Ceremony September 26, 2012 2 3 KU Endowment News Release Release date: Monday, June 25, 2012 Reproduced from the original release with slight modifications FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT: Rosita McCoy/785 -832-7336/ rmccoy@kuendowment.org Lisa Scheller/785 -832-7398/ lscheller@kuendowment.org Major gift establishes physiology chair at KU Medical Center KANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 An educational opportunity at the University of Kansas Medical Center made such a positive influence on his late daughter's life that Jim Osborn, of Honolulu, made a gift to KU Endowment in 2012 t o create the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair in Molecular and Integrative Physiology in her memory. Paul Cheney, professor and chair of the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, is the inaugural recipient. He is internationally recognized for his neuroscience research and has a 30 -year track record of grant support from the National Institutes of Health. Through the years, he has received a number of awards for his teaching and mentoring, as well as for his research. His research focuses on two ar eas: the brain control of movement and the neurological disease associated with HIV/AIDS. \"Words alone cannot convey the depth of my gratitude to Jim Osborn and family for their amazing generosity to our department. Their gifts have made our department mu ch stronger and competitive, and we will be forever thankful,\" said Cheney. \"Jim is such a delightful and thoughtful person whom I had the pleasure of meeting in person during a recent trip to Hawaii. It is truly incredible what a simple doctor's visit by Kathleen Osborn to KU Medical Center back in the late 1960s has turned into. We are honored to keep the memory of Kathleen and her love of science alive through this professorship in her name.\" Paul Cheney 4 During the summers of 1968 and 1969, Kathleen worked in the reproductive physiology lab of Gilbert Greenwald at the KU School of Medicine. Osborn said this came about after Kathleen developed an interest in science and biology in high school and college. Greenwald offered her a summer job in his lab through a F ord Foundation grant. The position continued the following summer. The experience was particularly meaningful to Kathleen, said Osborn. \"It might have motivated her to enter a career in science, had she not been taken from us prematurely in an automobile accident in 1970,\" he said. At the time of her death, Kathleen was in her junior year at the University of Missouri. Osborn said he and his late wife, Marion, had such high regard for Dr. Greenwald, who died in 2004, and for the medical research objectives of the physiology department, along with such deep gratitude for Kathleen's experience, that they made estate plans to benefit the medical center through KU Endowment. \"Marion and I have had a love affair with the University of Kansas Medical Center f or over 40 years,\" said Osborn. While Jim's estate would have created the chair honoring Kathleen after his death, a recent letter from KU that mentioned Far Above: The Campaign for Kansas prompted his decision to make the gift sooner. \"What evolved f rom that letter announcing the Far Above campaign was the decision to proceed with establishing a permanent and lasting memorial to Kathleen, which has now become a reality,\" said Osborn. Prior to establishing this chair, Osborn has made other significant gifts for the medical center. In 1972, he and his wife established a fund to honor their daughter through the Kathleen Osborn Lectureship at KU Medical Center. The ongoing lectureship features world- renowned scientists in reproductive biology. After Mari on's death in 2004, Osborn established the Marion M. Osborn Professorship for Reproductive Science at the KU School of Medicine; L eslie Heckert is the inaugural recipient. Osborn said that \"as the sole survivor of this once endearing family,\" it gave him peace of mind to create the professorship honoring his wife and the chair honoring his daughter so that he could see the gifts doing good during his lifetime. Both the professorship and chair qualify for the Kansas Partnership for Faculty of Distinction program, which encourages private donors to help recruit and retain renowned professors. The program provides endowed professorships with additional state funding in perpetuity. The gift is part of Far Above: The Campaign for Kansas , the university's com prehensive fundraising campaign. The campaign is managed by KU Endowment, the independent, nonprofit organization serving as the official fundraising and fund- management organization for 5 KU. Founded in 1891, KU Endowment was the first foundation of its ki nd at a U.S. public university. ************************************************************************************ ********************** RESEARCH FUNDING : Despite the very difficult funding environment at NIH our department continues to do well overall . Some of this success can be attributed to replacing NIH funding with funding from a variety of other sources. This year, total research funding for the department was just over eight million dollars based on data provided by KUMC Enterprise Analytics. W hile this is not a record amount, it is still a very healthy level of funding and actually represents a considerable increase over last year's level of 6.3 million. NIH funding also improved this year rising to $4,364,350 from $3,909,282 last year. Based on the latest available data, our department was ranked 45th nationally in NIH research funding among 127 public and private medical schools. Nearly every faculty member's research program was supported by major external funding. It is a tribute to the de dication and talent of our faculty that the department has continued to do so well in spite of the extremely difficult federal and private research funding environment. EDUCATION: Dr. Merrill Tarr, long -time Director of Medical Education in the department , officially retired in June of 2012. With his retirement, Dr. John Wood took over as Director of the Cardio-pulmonary module of the medical curriculum and Dr. Mike Wolfe took over as Director of the Renal - Endocrine module. Thanks to careful preparation for this transition and the dedication of Drs Wood and Wolfe, these modules did not miss a beat and have continued to perform at a high level. To the credit of all the individual faculty instructors and particularly to Drs Wood and Wolfe, the Cardiopulmona ry and Renal -Endocrine modules were both rated highly by the students. This was again another very successful year in terms of teaching awards. At the \"Grande Affair\" celebration in April, Dr. Wood and Dr. Blanco were recognized for excellence in teaching . They each won the Student Voice Award for \"Outstanding Lecturer\" in the first year of the medical curriculum. Dr. Blanco also won outstanding lecturer from second year students for his teaching in the Integration and Consolidation module. This continues what is now many consecutive years for each of them winning this award. We congratulate both John and Gustavo on their teaching success. And once again this year our department was the recipient of the \"Outstanding Module in the First Year\" award, which went to the Cardio- pulmonary module. Dr. Wood serves as director of this module and deserves a lot of credit for the continued success of this module. MORE BUDGET CUTS: The budget cuts continued this year with our department returning another 2% of t he institutional funding. This continues to be a painful exercise that has resulted in permanent elimination of faculty and staff positions. TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: We are very pleased and excited that Dr. Warren Nothnick joined our department in Ju ly of 2012 as a transfer from OBGYN. Warren has collaborations with other members of our department and is a highly respected member of the reproductive biology group. Warren's laboratory focuses on examining the mechanisms which regulate uterine develo pment and function, identifying factors which contribute to these mechanisms and understanding how alterations in these mechanisms lead to uterine diseases such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer. RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS : There were no new appoi ntments to the research track during the year. JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS : Joan Lewis -Wambi, Ph.D. was approved for a joint appointment as assistant professor in our department beginning July 1 st, 2013. Joan's primary appointment is assistant professo r in Cancer Biology. She is a molecular biologist who works on 6 mechanisms of endocrine- resistant breast cancer (e.g., tamoxifen resistant) and uses that knowledge to help develop alternative treatment options for patients with resistant and metastatic dise ase. FACULTY PROMOTIONS: Three members of our faculty from Stowers were promoted during the year. Peter Bauman was promoted to full professor , Kausik Si was promoted to associate professor and Sue Jaspersen was promoted to associate professor . Dr. Baum an has a very impressive record of accomplishment with papers in PNAS and Nature . He also received an Early Career Scientist Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Peter has also been highly active in our department. He is a member of our graduate program advisory committee, serves as primary mentor for graduate students and gives several lectures for the IGPBS core curriculum. Dr. Si's work has had a major impact on the field of synaptic plasticity, memory and leaning. He has published some l andmark studies including papers in Cell, PNAS and Neuron and he is very active in our graduate program. Dr. Jaspersen works on mechanisms that control the transfer of genetic information during cell division. She is highly accomplished with publications in prominent journals such as Science. She has taken an active role in our graduate program with development of a course on Advanced Genetic Analysis for the IGPBS curriculum. FACULTY/STAFF DEPARTURES: We are pleased to report that there were no faculty (tenure track) or staff departures during the year. FACULTY AWARDS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Dr. Gustavo Blanco won the 2012 Research Investigator Award , which was presented at Faculty Research Day on October 26 th, 2012. Congratulations to Dr. Blanco. Numerous members of our faculty served on NIH grant review panels, editorial boards for journals and gave invited lectures at other Universities and at national and international meetings. GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PHYSIOLOGY SOCIETY: The graduate students in the department had another active year. The \"Physiology Society\" leadership included Jitu George as President, Jessica Johnson as Vice President and Keke Pounds as Social Event Coordinator. We are very pleased with the success of the graduate program in Physi ology. In July of 2012, seven new students were recruited to the department. Including students who are working at Stowers with faculty members who have their academic appointment in Physiology, w e now have 39 doctoral students actively enrolled in the department.

Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor Our laboratory s tudies the role of ion- transport proteins of the plasma membrane in cell function. Research is focused on the Na, K -ATPase, a plasma membrane enzyme system that uses the energy from ATP to establish high intracellular K+ and low intracellular Na+ concentrations which are essential for maintaining cell volume, membrane potential, pH and ion balance. The Na,K -ATPase comprises a group of isozymes, each characterized by unique enzymatic properties and a cell -dependent and developmentally regulated pattern of ex pression. Research is focused on two main projects. 1. We are studying the function of alpha4, a particular isoform of the catalytic subunit of the Na,K -ATPase that is selectively expressed in spermatozoa. We have found that this isoform, has functional properties that are different from all other Na,K -ATPases. Alpha4 is expressed in the mid- piece of the sperm flagellum, and is important for sperm motility and fertility. A variety of molecular, cell biology and genetics approaches are being used to study t he regulation, activity and mechanisms of action of alpha4 in sperm physiology. Also, we are searching for compounds that will inhibit alpha4 with the idea of using them as male contraceptive agents. These studies will help understand the importance of ion transport in male gamete fertility and contraception. 2. In addition, we are studying the role of the Na,K -ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Working with renal cells from patients with ADPKD and various mouse models of ADPKD, we have found that the Na,K -ATPase exhibits an abnormally increased sensitivity to ouabain, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Importantly, ouabain stimulates cystogenesis in ADPKD cells and kidneys. Currently, we are investigating how ouabain affects cyst formation and progression in the disease.

The spike (action potential) activity of single neurons is recorded in awake monkeys trained to perform various movement tasks. Computerized analysis techniques are used to reveal t he functional contribution of a neuron or localized groups of neurons to movement. In another project, SIV infection in monkeys is used as model of neuro-AIDS. This model is used to investigate interactions between SIV infection and drugs of abuse using n eurobehavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor My research interests include uterine fibroids, fertility and contraception. Our laboratory is currently trying to understand the roles of GPR10, and its upstream regulator REST, in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. We identified that the loss of REST, a tumor suppressor protein, leads to the overexpression of GPR10 in fibroids. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing GPR10 in the myometrium i n order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of fibroids. Additionally, we have generated a conditional knockout mouse model for REST to understand its role in the development of fibroids.

Christenson, Ph.D. , Associate Professor My research is focused on understanding the molecular processes of reproduction in order to enhance and inhibit fertility. My primary interest is focused on understanding the post -transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms (i.e., microRNA -mediated) that facilitate ovulation and luteinization of the ovarian follicle following the LH surge. These studies have identified LH -regulated microRNAs and their target transcripts; ultimately these genes may be useful in controlling fer tility and/or understanding diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a major cause of human infertility. My laboratory also remains interested in understanding how cholesterol metabolism impacts ovarian function, we have established a collabor ations with two other laboratories to pursue this line of study. In conjunction with Dr. Annabelle Rodiguez (John Hopkins) we currently are studying single nucleotide polymorphisms in the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) and the effects on cholest erol transport from HDL and LDL particles. Additionally, in conjunction with Dr. Brad Van Voorhis at U. of Iowa, we are identifying markers of embryo quality from spent medium of human in vitro fertilization (IVF) using high throughput proteomic approaches. Lastly, because of our interest in miRNA research, my laboratory has partnered with a clinician, Dr. Ajay Bansal at the Kansas City VA Hospital to use next generation sequencing and our established miRNA methods to identify biomarkers involved in the t ransition of gastric reflux disease (GERD) to the benign Barrett's Esophagus and ultimately esophageal cancer.

Geiger, Ph.D., Associate Professor Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and is typically correlated with obesity and aging. In our lab, we study the molecular mechanisms underlying age- related and high fat diet -induced insulin resistance. We hypothesize that oxidative stress is responsible for inhibiting insulin signaling and for the impairment of glucose homeostasis. Stress kinases such as JNK and IKK - are activated by oxidative stress and have recently been implicated in inhibiting insulin signal transduction. Thus, we are examining the targeted inhibition of stress kinases to improve insulin sensitivity. We are also exploring therapeutic interventions such as heat therapy, exercise and anti -oxidant treatment in high fat -fed rats.

Gonzalez, M.D. , Professor My research centers on the mechanisms of adaptation of organisms to hypoxia. This includ es the study of the effects of acute and chronic hypoxia, induced by a reduction on the levels of inspired oxygen, on each of the linked conductances of the oxygen transport system in resting and exercising animals, and the effects of exercise training on the strategies of acclimatization to hypoxia and their impact on the oxygen transport system. Longitudinal studies in rats artificially selected for diverging aerobic capacities have provided important clues on the development of the mechanisms of oxygen transport along several generations. Another important research line is the study of the underlying mechanisms of the microvascular inflammatory response to systemic hypoxia, which may have functional relevance to acute altitude diseases such as acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema and high altitude cerebral edema. We have demonstrated that the ubiquitous inflammatory response to alveolar hypoxia is not triggered by the reduction of the local tissue PO2, but rather by a mediator, Monocyt e Chemoattractant Protein - 1 (MCP -1/CCL2) released by alveolar macrophages and transported by the circulation. These studies highlight the extrapulmonary functions of alveolar macrophages, which may play a role in the systemic effects of pulmonary diseases associated with low systemic oxygen levels. On January 1, 2013 I started the Phased retirement program, with 50% effort for three years. I have closed my laboratory and ended the main source of support of my laboratory, a grant from the NIH which I maintained for 23 years. I continue some collaborative research efforts and will direct my efforts to teaching and publishing data collected during the last year Meetings Attended: February 27- March 2, 2013 - International Hypoxia Symposium, Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada Committee Activities: Departmental Member, Promotion and Tenure Committee Editorial and Grant Reviews : Reviewer, The Journal of Applied Physiology Reviewer, Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology Reviewer, The American Journal of Physi ology, Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology Reviewer, American Journal of Physiology, Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology Reviewer, International Journal of Sports Medicine Editorial Board, Journal of Hypoxia 87 Dr. Gonzalez (continued) Seminars Presented: February 27- March 2, 2013 - \"Increased Nitric Oxide Contributes to the Microvascular Acclimatization of Prolonged Hypoxia,\" International Hypoxia Symposium, Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada Teaching Activities: Respiratory Physiology, Cardiopulmonary Module 5 lectures 2 small group meetings, Cardiopulmonary Module Taught in the graduate course Integrative Physiology of Exercise directed by Dr. Paige Geiger 88 Vijayalaxmi Gupta, Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor The first proj ect that I am working on is to synthesize and test reversible non- hormonal non-steroidal male contraceptive agents. Specifically, my role involves testing novel compounds (in- vitro as well in -vivo) as potential male contraceptives. I also work on determi ning the mechanism of action of potent compounds and facilitating toxicology, fertility studies for the compound likely to advance towards clinical trials. A second major research interest, concerns whether reproductive potential is affected by space fli ght. To this effect, we examined the effects of microgravity on the female reproductive tract of mice that were flown on the space shuttle on flights STS -131, STS - 133 and STS -135. Our studies on these three space shuttle missions were the first to examine the consequences of space flight on ovaries and uteri of mice. We found that with 12 -15 days of space- flight exposure, female mice showed significantly small ovaries. Histological analysis showed that flight mice ovaries had fewer corpora lutea and most of the growing follicles in flight ovaries were atretic, indicative of blocked estrous cycle. Ground and flight mice had no significant difference in number of uterine glands, but there was a trend to- ward smaller uteri in flight mice based on the gross pictures, which correlates with the low estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) level. This sets the foundation for our hypothesis that drop in estrogen in reproductive system may be the cause of other estrogen regulated effects seen in the body (bone and muscle los s, wound- healing, immune functions etc.) when exposed to space- flight.

Heckert, Ph.D. , Marion M. Osborn Professor for Reproductive Sciences The research in our laboratory focuses on the transcriptional and cell -signaling processes for proper function and development of the gonads. Sequence and structural information of the genome are queried to identify new proteins and regulatory pathways that direct cellular differentiation and gametogenesis, with the goal of extending our understanding of the mechanistic requirements for fertility as a means to impr ove the options for contraception as well as diagnosis and treatment of infertility. The current research is focused primarily on genes that encode the follicle- stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and doublesex and mab- 3 related transcription factor 1 (DM RT1). FSHR is required for cells to respond to the pituitary hormone FSH and thus hormone signaling occurs only in cells that produce the receptor. FSHR expression is highly cell - specific, limiting FSH response to only somatic cells of the gonads. DMRT1 is a transcription factor that is essential for male fertility. It is found only in the testis, where it is required for the differentiation and survival of both germ cells and Sertoli cells.

Rajendra Kumar, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Our laboratory studies developmental genetics and physiology of the mammalian pituitary -gonadal axis using both gain- of-function (transgenic) and loss -of-function (gene knockout) approaches. These unique genetic models mimic many of the human diseases and thus enable us to experimentally track them both in time and space. Speci fic projects focus on: mechanisms of origin and development of human pituitary null cell tumors, mechanisms of transcriptional/post -transcriptional regulation, biosynthesis secretion of mechanisms of gonadotropin regulation of testis and ovarian development and function, with a special emphasis on how male germline stem cell niche regulates male germ cell development and maintenance. These studies are clinically relevant and have significant translational impact on understanding the physiology and pathology of the mammalian reproductive axis including abnormal reproductive tract development, infertility, and cancer of the pituitary and gonads.

McGinnis , Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor Over 4 million children have been born from artificial reproductive techniques (ARTs). To protect the health of children born by ARTs, we need to improve our understanding of gamete biology, embryology and the signaling pathways essential for normal healthy development. Our research focuses on tyrosine kinase signaling in the oocyte during maturation and fertilization. Several of these kinases are activated in cultured somatic cells in response to stress. While some of these kinases, such as FYN and FER are very highly expressed in oocytes, their response to in vitro culture stress of oocytes and embryos is unknown. The long- term goal of my research is to define the regulation and targets of these kinase signaling pathways in oocytes and to determine if these pathways function properly during clinical in vitro maturation and fertilization procedures.

Nothnick, Ph.D. , Professor The uterus is a vital organ for the successful propagation of all higher species. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contr ibute to the development and subsequent function of the uterus are absolutely essential for successful reproduction to occur. It is well established that complex interactions among biological mediators dictate the normal pattern of uterine development and that disruption of these factors plays a causative role in uterine abnormalities, disease and infertility. Our research focuses on three major areas: 1) the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of the female disease, endometriosis, 2) the r ole of miRNAs in uterine decidualization and early pregnancy loss/embryo implantation insufficiencies, and 3) the identification and development of novel, estrogen- sparing targets for endometriosis treatment. Collectively, the research in my laboratory focuses on examining the mechanisms which regulate normal uterine development and function, identifying those factors which contribute to these mechanisms and understanding how alterations in these mechanisms lead to uterine diseases such as endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss/infertility. The long- term goal of the research conducted in my laboratory is to better our understanding of the pathophysiology of these uterine diseases and in turn develop novel diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic agents for their treatment.

We utilize a non-human primate model of stroke recovery to determine the neurophysiologic, neuroanatomic, and biochemical bases for recovery. By tracking changes in the structure and function of motor areas of the cerebral cortex as a result of a focal vascular infarct, we are beginning to describe the cascade of events that give rise to the reorganized brain. We are also studying novel forms of tr eatment in chronic stroke to enhance and accelerate the recovery process. These treatment interventions include both physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or device- based approaches, either alone or in combination. It is our goal to translate directly the inform ation we gain through brain plasticity research into effective clinical applications.

Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by RNA binding protein is a crucial mechanism in regulating the timing and the amount of expression of genes. Gr owing evidence indicate that the alteration of the expression and function of RNA binding proteins could potentially play a role in inflammation and cancer. Hence, it is indispensable to identify the RNA binding protein alterations accumulate during cancer progression as well as during the acquisition of metastatic potential in cancer cells. To understand the mechanisms behind the process of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in metastasis. Metastasis entails the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor throughout the body through the blood or lymphatic systems. Hence, blocking angiogenesis could be a strategy to arrest tumor growth. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis processes and their regulation will lead to the discovery of pharmaceutical agents with anti -angiogenic activity. .

Treatment and prevention of colon cancer is often unsuccessful and has an extremely high m orbidity rate. The major feature of solid tumors is hypoxia; the decreased availability of oxygen has been shown to increase chemotherapy resistance thereby favoring tumor progression. Hypoxia and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) stabilize HIF -1 (hypoxia inducible protein- 1), a endothelial factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase HSP90 inhibitors inhibit the expression of VEGF and iNOS suggesting that HSP90 is a critical player in HIF -1 mediated expression of these genes. My research focuses on understanding the mechanism of hypoxia- mediated regulation of cancer stem cells and the effect of hypoxia on hypoxia inducible factor. In addition, to determine the effect of natural HSP90 inhibitors, celastrol and triptolide on the growth and tumor formation of cancer stem cells. Addition to this, isolating cancer cells from fresh human cancer patient sample and to try HSP90 inhibitor with and without hypoxia.

Smith, Ph.D. , Professor, Director of the Institute for Neurological Dis coveries , Co-Director of the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center Nerves regulate function and structure of target cells. In turn, target cell s provide molecular signals that govern the quantity and type of innervation they receive. Our research is concerned with this interplay between nerves and targets in controlling end organ activity and in processing sensory signals. We are particularly interested in how hormones and vitamins can regulate neuronal function in conditions such as chronic pain syndromes, and in how genetic variants can lead to developmental neurological disorders Meetings Attended: October 11- 13, 2012.

Tash, Ph.D. , Professor My research is funded both by NIH and by NASA. My NIH- funded research focuses on reproductive biology and the regulation of sperm motility and sperm function, and identification of testis and/or sperm specific functional components that can be targeted for development of reversible non- hormonal male contraceptive agents. My ongoing NIH grant effort is focusing on continued drug development and elucidating the mechanism of action of H2- gamendazole (H2- GMZ), 100% -potent anti -spermatogenic c ontraceptive agent. The project is also discovering alternative chemical scaffold lead agents that target the same Sertoli cell molecular targets as H2- GMZ. We recently met with the FDA to establish the first ever guidance for a non- hormonal male contraceptive that established the testing necessary to enable registering H2- GMZ as an IND and to ultimately enable first -in human clinical trials. With regard to gravitational research, I have been funded by NASA since 1996 and examining the effects of space fli ght on both male and female reproductive health. I have had 5 flight experiments on the Space Shuttle from 1997- 2011, including three of the last five shuttle flights). We recently completed a successful flight experiment in May, 2013 on a Russion BION s atellite that was the largest and longest animal space flight experiment in NASA and Russian Space Agency history. We are examining the effects of 30 days of space flight, including continuous exposure to microgravity and space radiation, on testis function and sperm health in adult male mice. A new NASA grant scheduled to begin funding in Aug 2013, will be the first ever flight of mammalian and sea urchin sperm to the International Space Station National Laboratory to study the impact of space flight on sp erm motility, metabolomics and signal transduction.
