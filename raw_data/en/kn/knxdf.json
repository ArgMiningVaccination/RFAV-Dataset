Robert S French AC Graduation from The University of Western Australia is an achievement reflecting years of commitment to higher learning. It also marks the acquisition of the ability to continue to learn, to reason critically and, over time, to acquire the wisdom that comes by joining learning and reasoning to life experience. For those graduates and their teachers who have had to work through the constraints and difficulties of pandemic restrictions, it is a part icularly notable achievement. I offer sincere congratulations to all. It is an achievement which makes you all part of our history. As the holder of a degree at The University of Western Australia, you join generations of students who have passed throug h the lecture theatres and tutorial rooms at the University, since it came into existence in 1911. You are now part of its history as much as it is part of yours. The prime mover in the establishment of the University was its first Chancellor, Sir John Winthrop Hackett, a leading Western Australian politician, philanthropist and the proprietor of The West Australian newspaper. The University's purpose, from its foundation, was expressed in practical terms - to provide instruction in 'practical arts and liberal studies' which would help develop the fledging economy of Western Australia and thereby 'advance the prosperity and welfare of the people'. The University's motto encompasses that purpose with a higher ideal in urging all who pass through it t o 'seek wisdom'. The first 184 students enrolled at the University attended their lectures, which began on 31 March 1913, in timber and iron huts located in Irwin Street, Perth. From those humble beginnings the generation and transmission of knowledge, ex pertise and innovation at The University of Western Australia has played a significant part in the economic development of Western Australia. It has inspired the work of thousands of researchers and equipped tens of thousands of graduates to contribute in myriad ways to our society. UWA is one of the world's leading universities. Our graduates go into the world equipped with skills and qualifications which will enable them to engage with the pressing challenges of the day and to advance our society in all fields of human endeavour. I wish you well as you apply your learning, and the wisdom acquired by life experience combined with that learning, for the benefit of Western Australia, our nation and the wider global community.

If I do not viola te this oath, may I enjoy life, be respected while I live and be remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help. Above all else, I will do no harm to my fellow human beings and especially to my patients. I make this declaration solemnly, freely, and upon my honour.

The University of Western Australia Graduation - Monday 19 December 2022 at 2pm | 20 The University's Graduation Ceremonies at Winthrop Hall The first students to graduate from UWA graduated on 29 July 1914. Graduation ceremonies were originally held in the Government House Ballroom, until the official opening of Winthrop Hall on 13 April 1932. The Hall is one of the Hackett Memorial Buildings financed substantially by the very generous bequest received from the estate of Sir John Winthrop Hackett. It is located at the southern end of Whitfeld Court, contributing a great deal to the impressive nature of the University's entrance. In those early years, a single annual ceremony was sufficient for all graduating students. Today with more than 25,000 enrolled students and more than 6,800 degrees, d iplomas and certificates awarded annually , the University conducts more than 20 ceremonies each year, all in Winthrop Hall. Measuring 41 metres long by 18 metres wide and with a height from floor to ceiling of 15 metres, Winthrop Hall seats 1069 people i n the body of the Hall and 150 or more on the dais. The foyer features a mosaic floor of Italian marble, a gilded mosaic panel in memory of Sir Alfred Langler, whose financial skill as administrator of the Hackett estate resulted in the University receivin g a considerably enhanced bequest, and a stained glass window in honour of Dr William Hancock, a pioneer of radiology in Western Australia and former member of the Senate, the governing body of the University. Upon entering the Hall, the impressive sights of the McGillivray Organ and the Rose Window sit above the dais at the opposite end of the Hall. Jarrah panelling lines the lower half of all other walls, each of which bears the shields of other Australian and some overseas universities. The shield for this University is hung centrally at the back of the dais and is a modified version of the shield in the original UWA Coat of Arms registered with the College of Arms in 1972. The ceiling was decorated by George Benson in 1931 . In 2007, during the restoration of the organ and the cleaning of the Rose Window, University staff rediscovered some secret paintings. Benson included 10 caricatures, two unfinished, of various local dignitaries at the time. Only four of the caricatures have been identified to date: Dr James Battye, Sir Walter James, Judge John Northmore and Dr William Somerville, while the others still remain a mystery. Academic gowns The practice of wearing academic dress on formal occasions has a long and illustrious history. The title of Chancellor was originally bestowed on important officials in the medieval church and was later applied to the chief dignitary of a university. It also refers to the chief judicial officer of England, the Lord Chancellor, whose robes are similar to those worn by university chancellors. Thus, it is important to remember that the gowns of the Chancellor (who is appointed by the Senate), the Pro- Chancello r (who is elected by the Senate to act on the Chancellor's behalf when he or she is unavailable), and the Vice -Chancellor (who is the Chief Executive Officer of the University), are not strictly academic gowns: they do not signify the wearer's degree but t he office held. The Chancellor's gown is of black silk faced with white silk and trimmed with gold braid down each front. A flap collar at the back is faced with white silk and trimmed with gold braid and with open sleeves fully lined with white silk, tr immed with gold braid and turned back to form a triangle bisected by two loops of gold cord from the shoulders. The cap is a black velvet trencher with gold tassel and button and trimmed with three centimetres of gold braid. The Pro -Chancellor's gown is similar to the Chancellor's gown but trimmed with gold cord down each front with a flap collar at the back faced with white silk. This is also trimmed with gold cord, with open sleeves fully lined with white silk, trimmed with gold cord and turned back to form a triangle bisected by a loop of gold cord from the shoulders. The Pro- Chancellor also wears a black velvet trencher cap with gold tassel and button and trimmed with one -and- a-half centimetres of gold braid. The Vice -Chancellor's gown is trimmed wit h silver braid down each front with a flap collar at the back faced with white silk. Silver braid trims this collar and the open sleeves are fully lined with white silk, rimmed with silver braid and turned back to form a triangle bisected by two loops of s ilver cord from the shoulders. The black velvet trencher cap has a silver tassel and button and is trimmed with three centimetres of silver braid.
