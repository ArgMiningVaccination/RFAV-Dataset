The news has been swiftly followed by reports that the Government is considering whether physician associates should be given prescribing powers as part of its 'new deal' to relieve the pressures on GPs. A physician associate (PA) is a dependent health care professional who has been trained in the medical model and works under the supervision of a doctor or surgeon. PAs obtain medical histories, conduct comprehensive physical exams, request and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries, and can give preventive health advice to patients. PAs have a set national curriculum which sets standards and all PAs sit a national examination prior to qualification. PAs also have to retake their national examinations every six years to ensure they remain at a high standard. Plymouth University launched its physician associate training programme this January. The first cohort of 17 physician associate students come from a variety of backgrounds, including biomedicine, nursing, emergency medicine and other professional healthcare disciplines. Plymouth University joined forces with NHS trusts to sponsor places for students on the physician associates course. Plymouth was the first University in the UK to secure sponsored funding of this kind for its students. Five Trusts each paid for a number of student places on the course, in return for a two-year contract of employment on graduation. Every single student in the first cohort has received tuition fee sponsorship from an NHS Trust partner in the South West. Professor Alison Carr, Medical Director, Physician Associate Training Programme, PUPSMD, said: \"Physician Associates are an important new addition to the healthcare workforce in the UK. The launch of the Faculty of Physician Associates at the Royal College of Physicians is an important milestone in the acceptance of this new profession in the UK and one which we hope will strengthen the likelihood of regulation of the Physician Associates which would enable them to fully utilize their knowledge and skills in prescribing.\" Royal College of Physicians president Professor Jane Dacre said: \"I'm delighted that we are launching the Faculty, which will enable closer relationships between physicians and physician associates, and a greater understanding of their separate roles. We will also be able to support the professional development of physician associates by providing access to our educational and professional development resources, and our publications.\" Further Information For further information please contact the Postgraduate and Enquiries team on Tel: +44 (0)1752 application form](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/forms/postgraduate-application.html) [www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/pgdip-physician-associate-studies](http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/pgdip-physician-associate-studies) [www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/about-us/university-structure/faculties/medicine-dentistry/postgraduate-education-for-medicine-and-dentistry](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/about-us/university-structure/faculties/medicine-dentistry/postgraduate-education-for-medicine-and-dentistry) Amazing Grass Superfood from Blue Herbs Amazing Grass greens are USDA organic, Non GMO, kosher pareve, vegan and gluten free.

Breaking open the apricot kernels to remove the seeds These seeds have a form of cyanide which helps to break down the walls of cancer cells, but does not harm other cells within the body. Ernst Klebs' biochemical research in 1952 led to a compound found in over 1200 edible plants throughout nature. That compound is amygdalin Amygdalin is found with the highest concentration and necessary enzymes in apricot seed kernels.[1] Unfortunately there have been few 'double blind tests' to prove this. However many people have written testimonials and books confirming the success they have had in reducing cancer cells by changing their diet which includes eating Apricot Seeds.[2] We do know that certain peoples are virtually cancer-free, for example the Hunza, who live high in the Himalaya and eat apricot seeds as an after dinner snack, fresh in the summer and dried in the winter. Naturelle UK imports apricot seeds directly from the Himalaya where they grow at altitudes of 6,000 feet and are completely pesticide and fertiliser free. They are gathered by the local villagers, which adds a welcome supplement to their meagre incomes. The seeds can be crushed and added to your food, but should not be heated, as this will destroy a lot of the benefit. Notes and Further Reading 1. Ernst Klebs, an American biochemist identified the benefits of cyanogenic glycoside back in 1952.

Even if we claim not to be 'tech-savvy', we still email from our phones or scan documents. Other technologies prove harder to tame so we have to do some training. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) works in much the same way. We may learn from journals of peer-reviewed scientific developments or from talking to colleagues, but we do need to bite the bullet and get trained. Justin Johnson of Accredited Massage Courses teaching joint assessment on a Sports Massage course Even the ancient tradition of Massage evolves. For a long time, the work of the Massage Therapist was regarded as predominantly for relaxation; therapists worked in a spa environment and Holistic Massage techniques were developed into more specialized relaxation techniques - Hot Stone Massage, Pregnancy Massage or Indian Head Massage. But Massage also has a long therapeutic history. In the UK, the Society of Trained Masseuses was founded in 1894 by four nurses convinced of the therapeutic benefits of manual therapy. That society went on to become the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) - the body that represents the Physiotherapy profession in the UK today. In the intervening years, Physiotherapy has grown to encompass so many different therapeutic areas that, in the UK, it has largely moved away from hands-on, manual therapy. Massage Therapists have the opportunity to fill that gap. Many private Physiotherapy practices employ Massage Therapists to carry out their soft-tissue work, so there are opportunities for Massage Therapists to work at the forefront of therapeutic and rehabilitative manual therapy. As your knowledge grows, so your skills and techniques deepen. A Massage Therapist does not always need to refer patients to osteopaths, physiotherapists or chiropractors at the first sign of a complicated case. We need to know when to refer, but an experienced Massage Therapist should also have the confidence and knowledge-base to work autonomously. Massage can resolve complicated acute or chronic conditions such as lower back pain, cluster or tension headaches, frozen shoulder or tennis elbow. You may advise a patient to confirm a diagnosis with a GP or specialist, but there is no need to lose that patient over a condition for which massage is ultimately an extremely effective therapy.

She has lately just launched her Shamanic Jaguar Essence Range, they are part of a new category of essence ranges that are emerging and are specifically appropriate for shamans, for use during healings, ceremonial practises, for clients and any other forms of transformational processes. Clare has also designed a particular range of essences which has proved to be very succinct and powerful the Flowers of the Orient, Decoding & Recoding DNA Flower Essences Kit which is for enabling the transformation of old structures inherent in our DNA. For this ever changing and challenging world Clare recommends from this range a combination Positive Change: A decoder in order to recode at the fundamental DNA level [ancient conditioned patterns] past life carry-overs. It works on the frequency matrix that builds and dictates the unique nature & dance of our own DNA and encourages the ability to re think outside the box A fast acting essence which helps the cells to get the message That just because negative patterns are passed on for generations, doesn't mean it is set in stone. Ignites change, you can be the change you want to be. It actuates and helps to re build, re-invent your selves, almost on a daily basis As the challenge of initiating change can be exhausting it's important to positively support change by maintaining our energy reserves. Dynamic Recovery, from the Flower Essences of Australia is ideal in that it not only supports low adrenals & the immune system, its the great energy boost needed for maintaining positive change and growth. Indicated for tiredness, exhaustion and depleated energy with an inability to get going again, poor recuperation after ill health and promotes: dynamic recovery, balances the whole system, may be supportive as a pick me up and extra energy boost after deep exhaustion or ill health.

Softback. \u00a316.99. $26.96. ISBN: 978 1 905367 56 6. The Concise Book of Yoga Anatomy, released 30 June, is the definitive guide to the study of yoga anatomy - a perfect companion book for any yoga teacher or practitioner seeking to understand the biomechanics of the body as it applies to yoga practice. The book is visually designed in quick reference format to offer useful information about the main skeletal muscles that are central to yoga, with asanas to demonstrate the particular muscles and muscle groups. More than 230 full colour illustrations detail each muscle's origin, insertion, and action in order to clearly reveal how the muscles come into play in the movements and postures of yoga. The appendix rounds out the asanas included in most 200-hour trainings, and provides a glossary of verbs and cues to aid in the practice and teaching of yoga. Knowledge of yoga anatomy is paramount to the ability to teach or practice with no injury to oneself or others. With this foundation in place, it is possible to focus on the spiritual element of yoga as well as the physical. Yoga is a union of the two, so where appropriate, the more profound side of the practice is mentioned as it relates to the body. The Concise Book of Yoga Anatomy illustrates the form and function of the muscles first, then interlays the muscles into the yoga posture for full understanding in a clear and integrated way, explaining the technique of the asanas, as well as other more subtle, deeper aspects of yoga: awareness, prana, bandhas, chakras, and relaxation. Author Jo Ann Staugaard-Jones says: \"In The Concise Book of Yoga Anatomy you will not find the asanas categorized under type, such as \"Standing\", but placed under a specific muscle that is used in that posture. It is yet another way to look at the anatomy of yoga. As students, guides, and facilitators of yoga, and as human beings looking to understand the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects, we can use yoga as a blueprint toward the study of form and the philosophy of living: \"do no harm\" (in Sanskrit, ahimsa).\" About the Author Jo Ann Staugaard-Jones is a full professor of kinesiology, movement science and dance. She is an advanced Pilates and yoga instructor (RYT500, Himalayan Institute) with a master's in dance and education, receiving degrees from the University of Kansas and New York University before pursuing a career as a performer, choreographer, teacher, and movement scientist. The author of the highly regarded titles The Vital Psoas Muscle, and The Anatomy of Exercise and Movement for the Study of Dance, Pilates, Sports, and Yoga, she currently teaches interactive movement workshops across the U.S. and sponsors international holistic retreats, yoga anatomy courses, and full teacher trainings.

We encourage practitioners to look at exogenous and endogenous influences affecting health and how these factors can contribute to the complexity of symptoms and dis-ease. Whilst out therapy is predominantly driven by homoeopathic therapy, we do extend our products to cover a wide spectrum of integrative modalities. We offer detoxification and drainage remedies to help access and eliminate the root cause of problems. Anti-pathogenic formulations help eliminate harmful microbes. Immune enhancers and nutritional support remedies help rebuild and strengthen weakened organs and body systems. Toxicity is greatly influencing today's health. Our therapeutic tools can greatly support a personalised health plan to ensure a balanced and coordinated approach to wellness. Regenerating through homoeopathy, organ support and detoxification Homoeotherapy uses homoeopathic principles to improve health. This system of natural medicine recognises the whole person - mind, body and spirit. Recognising the evolution of people and healthcare in a modern society means appreciating all the influences that can reflect the totality of the mind/body/spirit connection. The vital force requires constant nurturing. Homoeopathy seeks to stimulate the body's self-regulating mechanisms to initiate the healing process and restore balance to the life-force energy which sustains life. Xenobiotics, homoeopathic detox remedies, address the ill effects of a specific host of toxins. Liquescences or 'organ supports' encourage drainage and will help avoid aggravation or a 'healing crisis'. This is critically important in cases of severe and multiple toxic conditions. Liquescences and sarcodes focus on the practical utilisation of homoeopathy for nutritional and organ deficiencies and play a foundational role in disease-prevention. Our philosophy offers an effective and sustainable paradigm for healthcare, nurturing self-healing and nourishment. We have examined all the fundamentals associated with the matrix that is holistic health - nutrition, emotional well-being and toxicology and we present an integrated and modern-day approach to health restoration and maintenance. Working energetically to restore vitality We are dedicated to supporting practitioners every step of their journey. As well as our telephone support line, we are also committed to helping practitioners on a practical level. Incorporating the New Vistas philosophy of health into clinics enhances the spectrum of healing available to clients. We provide a selection of professional test kits, a prescription service and offer CPD seminars and formal training. We acknowledge practitioners and the satisfactory level of quality which is expected within our area of healthcare. New registrations are welcome.

AtlasPROfilax\u00ae now Available at The BackCare Clinic The BackCare Clinic are delighted to announce we have been able to add the AtlasPROfilax\u00ae pain relief system to their treatment options. AtlasPROfilax\u00ae offers an incredible, 100% Natural Method to assist with pain treatment, discomfort and pain prevention and self-healing. This simple, safe and quick correction method has seen patients with various types of pain and conditions experience amazing results - even just after their first 45 minute session. Matthew Voigts, an osteopath with 25 years' experience will be working at the clinic one Tuesday a month. Watch on Youtube [www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajcvFOH6m0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajcvFOH6m0) AtlasPROfilax is a natural non-invasive method developed by Renee-Claudius Schumperlii between 1993 and 1996. This technique allows the correction of a minor dysfunction of the Atlas - the first verebra of the spinal column - through a regulated vibropressure on particular short muscles in the neck. Among the most frequent causes of minor dysfunction of the Atlas are events such as instrument assisted births, some obstetric handlings, moderate traumas to the cranio-mandibular area and accidents such as whiplash. A 5 year scientific imaging study using MRI and CAT in 3D demonstrated that a great proportion of the population have a deviation and would benefit from this treatment. The studies showed that it showed great improvements in cervical pain, idiopathic scoliosis, fibromyalgia, herniated discs in neck and lumbar spine, migraines or vascular headache and carpal tunnel syndrome. AtlasPROfilax is the application of a specific massage of the short muscles of the neck to allow a natural realignment of the Atlas. It is performed in a single session which is followed by a check up a few weeks later. There is no forceful manipulation of the neck. Once the Atlas is corrected there tends to be a progressive restoration of good posture, a natural realignment of the vertebrae as well as a decrease in pressure on articulations such as the hips and knees. It works wells with other treatments such as the Theraflex system to carry the natural unwinding of the spine. Cost of treatment is \u00a3225 for adults and \u00a3125 for under 16s to include follow up. Payment should be made in cash or cheque only.

Movement - the movement of your body and of substances around your body...... Mind - the thoughts and feelings that occupy your mind......

An Analysis of the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Sector by Bernadette Ward Published by LAP Lambert Academic Publishing. 2015. Softback. \u20ac41.00/$47.00 ISBN: 978 3 659 30230 5. This book is based on a 4 year research study carried out in Dublin City University, as an exploration into the Complementary and Alternative Medicine communities, in Ireland, the UK, with a comparison to other western countries. The study focused on public demand, practitioner training and explored quality oversight for the sector. Ireland`s CAM community of practitioners, students, regulators are used as an example of similar CAM communities in the English speaking world. The research sought to examine CAM communities, explore how learning is delivered and practitioners are created. It explores public demand for treatments and the provision of learning for courses in complementary therapies, examining if there is oversight in terms of quality of learning, or regulation of practice. It further seeks to identify and define the needs of this community in terms of their continued survival and growth within the broader healthcare sector. The CAM sector is a broadly based community of mature adults who can be seen as taking on the roles of both learners and practitioners. In many cases students undertaking education and training in a CAM therapy are returning to education and characteristically fit into the category of lifelong learning. They deliberately choose complementary therapies to either add to existing skills or to acquire a new skill or competency which will improve their employment opportunities. Provision of education and training across this sector meets a steady and consistent public demand for therapists in a variety of disciplines, and establishes a significant education sector, McDonough, Devine & Baxter (2007). There is a strong demand within Ireland, the UK and the English speaking world for CAM treatments of one type or another, CAMbrella (2012), This is reflected in a similar steady demand reported across the EU and documented in relevant literature which forms part of this study`s Literature Review, Ernst & White (2000), WHO (2003), DOHC (2001), DOHC (2005). Despite consumer demonstrations of choice in sourcing and paying for treatments, the CAM sector within the EU and most of the English speaking world remains unregulated and unsupported by successive governments, Budd & Mills (2000 Pg. 8). Data showed that Irish and UK governments actively discriminate against their CAM sectors. There is still no framework for recognition of their sectors, national registration of therapists, and in Ireland, no academic validation of CAM training programmes. This lack of acknowledgement is in direct conflict with the OECD, of which Ireland and the UK are active members with stated policies on equity and inclusion. The OECD advocates acknowledgement of all learning, without exception. Both countries have failed to define a structure for their CAM communities, References Budd S & Mills S (2000), Regulation in Complementary and Alternative Medicine, British Medical Journal.[Online] Available from: [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119419](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119419) / Pg 8[Accessed 4th Oct 2013] CAMbrella,(2012), The Roadmap to CAM European Research, An explanation of the CAMbrella project and its key findings[Online] Available from: 23.
