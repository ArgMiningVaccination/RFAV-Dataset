Semi-structured qualitative interviews were held with each participant, and a narrative analysis was used to generate research themes and findings. Re sults indicated that all five Elders perceived a potential for Indigenous and Western approaches and practitioners to work collaboratively together in the future, and Elders reported varying levels of ex perience with integrated healthcare delivery. However, all five Elders identified numerous is sues requiring attention and steps to be taken prior to integrated practice taking place. Th ese included the need to reclaim Indigenous knowledge, an acceptance and respect for Indige nous knowledge and practices by the Western healthcare system, and the need for increased an d formalized education related to Indigenous knowledge and healing approaches. iiAcknowledgements I would like to first expre ss my deepest and most heartf elt thanks to the Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers who participated and made this thesis possible. The knowledge, teachings, personal experiences, and stories that each individual contributed is truly a gift to both myself and the academic community at large. I would also like to th ank the collective of community informants that I queried and relied on for input, feedback, and direction. This project would not be what it is with out your thoughtful words and guidance. I would also like to thank my supervisor Dr. Suzanne L. Stewart for her immeasurable support and the countless hours of feedback, dire ction, and mentoring she has provided me with throughout the last two years. While she is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and transformative leaders in the academy, it has been her ability to role model balance, show caring support for her students, and advocate for the ne eds of our communities that has been most inspiring for me. I would also like to thank Dr. Roy Moodley for the time and guidance he has provided, and the mentoring he has given as a gr oundbreaking scholar in the area of integrated healthcare. I also extend my thanks to my p eers and fellow students who have never failed to offer kind and encouraging words at every stage of the process. And finally, I would not have been able to complete this piece of work without the endless supply of love and suppor t from my family. To my mother, who never failed to cheer me on with every written word, brought me desserts, told me it was okay to cry, and whose words \"little by little, bit by b it, inch by inch, slowly, surely, ev entually\" saw me through to the end. Thank you and all my love. And finally, to my source of strength and number one fan, Nick, thank you for bringing me coffee and flowers, fo r spending nights and always telling me I can call, for listening to me when I processed aloud, and for loving me in my weakest and strongest moments. My successes are the successes of everyone who has supported and mentored me throughout my life, and I am eternally grateful to each and every one of you. iii Table of Contents Title Page i A b s t r

the h ealth and well-being of their people since time immemorial. While some historians and academic s have tended to romanticize the health status of Indigenous peoples before contact with European col onizers, arguing that Indigenous groups did not suffer fr om any health or mental health problems at all, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that Indigeno us peoples did in fact encounter a diverse range of physical and mental health problem s prior to contact (Waldram, 2004). More importantly, however, is that these Indige nous groups had comprehensive systems and methods in place for healing, all stemming from an Indigenous conception of health and well-being. It has only been within the last sixty year s that the Canadian health system has begun to show an increasing interest and concer n in the physical and me ntal health needs of Canada's Indigenous peoples. The primary focus of this thesis is to examine a growing practice in the mental health sector, which is the integration of Indigenous and Western approaches to healing as a form of treatment for Indigenous peoples. As noted above, the existence of both physical and mental health problems among Indigenous groups in North American prior to Eu ropean contact in the late fifteenth century has been well documented (e.g. Waldram, 2004; Waldram, Herring, & Young, 2007). However, the nature, etiology, and occurrence of such health problems drastically differ from many of the physical and mental health pr oblems seen in many Indigenous communities today. A significant factor for the evolution of health problems was the arrival of European colonizers. In addition to new physical health problems and infectious diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis, many have argued that the legislated efforts at cultural genocide 2 have had severe and long-las ting impacts on the mental heal th of many Indigenous peoples today, which is reflected in elev ated rates of substance abuse, violence, trauma, and suicide, as compared to non-Indigenous peoples (Kirma yer, Brass, & Tait, 2000). While Indigenous nations had the knowledge and systems in place to address the health problems of pre- colonial times, newly introduced physical health problems, and the legacy of mental health issues resulting from colonizati on, in addition to the outlawing of Indigenous approaches to healing, have culminated in a complex, ofte ntimes dire, situation for many Indigenous communities across North America today. While Indigenous approaches to heali ng were driven underground by Canadian legislative acts in the 20th century, traditional knowledge and practices continued to be passed down through the generations. Indigenous Elders, often viewed as the bearers of cultural knowledge and tradition, have played a pivotal ro le in the transmission of Indigenous culture, and the practice of traditional healing. The revitaliz ation of Indigenous traditional healing practices and community-based approaches to h ealing over the past 50 years speaks to the undeniable strengths of Canadian Indigenous communities in overcoming the various atrocities that they have en countered. While the Indigenous h ealing movement continues to grow in strength, and Indigenous peoples continue to use an d reconnect with Indigenous forms of healing, various challenges remain for the widespread use of traditional healing methods. For instance, accessing the services of Indigenous h ealers remains a barrier for many Indigenous peoples (Kim & Kwok, 1998). I ndigenous healing methods are not viewed as a legitimate and empirically valid form of healing by many Western mental health bodies (LaFromboise, 1988). Despite research that has demonstrated the strong relationship between 3 health and culture for many Indigenous peoples, the vast majority of mainstream services continue to employ the singul ar use of Western informed treatment approaches. The use of Western approaches to heali ng with Indigenous clients has often proved ineffective, as evidenced by an under-usage of services, high drop-out rates, and Indigenous peoples' reports of low quality of care and se rvices received (Ha rris, et al., 2006; Shah, 2005; Sue, Allen, & Conway, 1978). Numerous scholar s have ventured to offer e xplanations for why Western approaches to healing have proven ineffectiv e, which have include d the absence of an Indigenous worldview and conception of health (Stewart, 2008), cult urally insensitive practitioners (Duran, 2006), a nd difficulties in establishing trust between the client and practitioner (Johnson & Cameron, 2001). In an a ttempt to tailor and enhance counselling services for Indigenous peoples, researchers, administrators, and practitioners alike have begun to call for an integration of Indigenous and Western approaches to healing (e.g. Duran, 2006; Moodley & West, 2005; Shore, Shore, & Manson, 2009). The design of an integrated approach, incl uding the specific Indigenous and Western methods to be conjointly used, varies dependi ng on the mental health issue and methods of the practitioners. One common recommendation for in tegrated service is the collaboration of Western professionals with Indigenous heal ers (e.g. Constantine, Myers, Kindaichi, & Moore, 2004; Ellerby, 2005; Rayle, Chee, & Sa nd, 2006). Additional examples of integrated services include the us e of sharing circles alongside cogniti ve-behavioural therapy (Heilbron & Guttamn, cere mony and pow-wow with post- traumatic stress disorder treatment programs (S hore, Shore, & Manson, 2009); and the use of sacred Indigenous medicines al ongside psychiatric counselling treatment (Mohatt & Varvin, 4 1998). While integrated programs have begun to gr ow in number, and th e call for integrated services continues to st rengthen, what is glaringly absent fr om this integrative movement are the voices of Indigenous Elders and healers th emselves. Indigenous Elders, in addition to traditional healers and medicine people, represent one of the primary collectives of people who conduct healing practices in their communitie s. They also tend to be viewed by their community as role models and sources of wis dom that hold as their goal the betterment of their communities and people. Their counsel is often sought during difficult decision-making processes, by both individuals and communitie s alike (Stiegelbauer, 1996). Given their role as cultural leaders, healers, and counsels, it is my belief that obtain ing the perspectives of Indigenous Elders on the proposed in tegrative healing movement is critical if advances are to be made in this effort, and if attempts at integration are to truly represent an equalitarian partnership between Indigenous and Western practitioners. It is therefore my intent to obtain and showcase the perspectives, experiences , and thoughts of Indigenous Elders on the paradigmatic aligning of Indigenous a nd Western approaches to healing. Statement of Purpose The purpose of this research is to co ntribute to the ongoing dialogue around the integration of Indigenous and Western approaches to heali ng by examining the views of Indigenous Elders. The research question to be answered is : What are Indigenous Elders perspectives on the integration of Indigenous and Western healing para digms, and what, if any, are their experiences of wo rking in integrated contexts? The results of this study will inform the academic literature by contributing to the under-researched area of the successes and chal lenges of integrating Indigenous and Western healing paradigms. The findings will also info rm the development of educational materials 5 and governmental policies related to the formulation of promisi ng mental health practices for Indigenous peoples, and will contribute to ongo ing efforts to better service Indigenous peoples in North America. The results from th is study will also inform the development of theory and practice when considering how to best integrate Indigenous and Western healing practices, and will be of particul ar use to mental health organizations, agencies which access the services of Indigenous Elders , individual mental health pract itioners and researchers, and Indigenous Elders themselves. Conceptual Framework for Research This research will be grounded in two conceptual frameworks: Indigenous ways of knowing and social constructionism. Part of my motivation for selecting these frameworks is that they reflect my understanding and concep tion of how knowledge is created. These two frameworks share several complementary tenets around the construction of knowledge, including the idea that knowledge is negotiated and created in contextual relationships. The following section contains a thorough review of each framework and how these perspectives will inform the current research project. Indigenous ways of knowing. Castellano (2000) has writ ten about the different sources of Aboriginal knowledge, which incl ude traditional, empirical, and revealed knowledge. Traditional knowledge is characteri zed as knowledge that has been passed down intergenerationally and typically includes creation stories, genealogies, ancestral rights, and stories which teach of a nation's values and beliefs. Empirical knowledge is knowledge which is gained through observation, and reveal ed knowledge is spiritual in nature and can be received through dreams, visions, and intu ition. In addition to these three types of knowledge, Castellano writes that \"Aboriginal knowledge is sa id to be personal, oral, 6 experiential, holistic, and conveyed in narrativ e or metaphorical language\" (p. 25). She also asserts that Aboriginal knowledge systems reject notions of unive rsal truths and prescriptive ways of knowing, and instead co mments that \"the personal natu re of knowledge means that disparate and even contradictory perceptions can be accepted as valid because they are unique to the person...people do not contest with one another to establish who is correct - who has the 'truth'\" (p. 26). In comparison to Western scientific no tions of knowledge and the search and acquisition of objective truth, di verse ways of creating or obtaining knowledge and multiple ways of knowing are valued and honoured in many Indigenous cultures. Many authors have spoken of the impor tance of relationship within Indigenous communities (e.g. McCormick, 1996; Weber-Pillwax, 1999). With respect to the creation of knowledge, Wilson (2001) has also highlighted the critical role that relationship plays. Wilson puts forward the idea that knowledge is relational; that is, knowledge is created in relationship with other entities, which include relationships with other humans, the animal and plant world, the ancestral or spirit world, and the cosmos. Since knowledge is created in relationship with other beings, it therefore cannot be owned, but only shared. This notion of shared knowledge is of particular importance fo r the research process as it will inform my understanding of how the results of this research may be conc eptualized and used in the future, which will be discussed below. Social constructionism. The second conceptual framework which I will draw on throughout the research process is social constructionism. Gerg en (1985) writes that \"social constructionism is principally concerned with elucidating the processes by which people come to describe, explain, or otherwise account for the world in which they live\" (p. 3). Some of the key principles that are inherent to this proce ss include challenging taken-for- 7 granted assumptions about the world, questioni ng the parameters which supposedly define knowledge, and rejecting the not ion of objective and univers al truth. Instead, social constructionism argues that knowledge is socia lly and culturally, and therefore contextually, based and created through relati onship. Subjective perspectives and experiences are therefore privileged and regarded as legitimate sources for the creation of knowledge and reality. The similarities between social co nstructionist and Indi genous frameworks therefore suggest their complementary suitability as the conceptual unde rpinnings for this research project, and will inform various aspects of the research process. The use of an Indigenous and social constr uctionist framework for this research has several implications for how th e research is conducted and conceptualized. First, these frameworks are ideally suited to my research question as I am interested in exploring the perspectives and lived expe riences of Indigenous Elders . An Indigenous and social constructionist framework therefore allows me to acknowledge and accept that there are multiple sources and ways of knowing in the world. These frameworks enabled me in retaining the diversity of pe rspectives and experiences of the Indigenous Elders that participated in this study, and the results are not be condensed into a un iversal experience or known truth. My interactions with each partic ipant is of particular importance, as the knowledge that is created through this research project will be done so in relationship. Definition of Terms A definition of terms used throughout this thesis will clarify specific meanings used in this research. The terms to be defined include: Indigenous, Indigenous Elders, mental health, and Western paradigm. 8 Indigenous. Indigenous is a general term that is used to describe members of three distinct Aboriginal groups in Canada, First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples (Statistics Canada, 2008), and will be the primary term used in this paper. Indigenous will also be used interchangeably with the terms Aboriginal, Nati ve, First Nations, M\u00e9tis, Inuit, First Peoples, Native American, Indian, and American Indian, and will be used as specific authors have cited them in their works. Indigenous Elders. Many different types of healer s exist in Indigenous communities in Canada. Anishnawbe Health Toronto (2000) ou tlined the roles of thre e distinct types of Aboriginal healers in one of their educational pamphlets: Traditional healers, Medicine people, and Elders. While these three categories of healer share a common trait, the ability to heal, the training process, healing process, and healing methods of each healer will vary. It is also important to note that variability also exis ts within each group of healer; that is, no two traditional healers or two Elders will have had the same journey towards becoming a traditional healer or Elder, nor will they use the exact same methods for their healing work. Anishnawbe Health Toronto (2000) stated that a medicine person is someone who principally works with plants a nd plant medicines to heal, and a traditional healer typically perceives their healing abilities as a gift from the spirit world (or Creator), and may use a range of methods to heal (plants, counsell ing, laying of hands, ceremony). Alternatively, an Elder is an individual who is recognized by their community as someone who holds the knowledge and teachings of the ancestors. While they may prac tice or facilitate various healing ceremonies (such as the sweat lodge or use of plant medicines) , the sharing of their wisdom is often considered a healing act in and of itself. 9 A detailed discussion of the characteristics and work of Indigenous Elders is to be provided in section two of this thesis. However, for the purpo ses of a definition of terms, Indigenous Elders in this thesis are defined as either males or females who are recognized by the community they work in as the holder s of cultural knowledge and teachings, whose counsel is often sought, and who posses the ability to heal th rough various methods (specific ceremonies, story-telling, use of plant medicine s, sharing of knowledge). As Ellerby (2005) noted \"Some [traditional] healers may not be Elders, while all Elders can be considered Healers\" (p. 9). Mental Health. No single definition of mental health exists, and the term is defined differently depending on the context and socio- cultural influences which are informing its conceptualization. For instance, within the Western tradition, mental health has historically been defined in relation to il lness and disorder. The American Psychiatric Association (2000) defined mental health as a state marked by the ab sence of illness or diso rder, as noted in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Four th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (p. xxx). The majority of ment al health practitione rs (psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers) in North America receive, at a minimum, training in the theory of this text, and many a dopt this understanding of mental health and use it as conceptual base to info rm psychotherapeutic practice. Evolutions in the conceptual ization of mental health have also occurred over time. For example, with the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948, a marked shift was seen in the definition of mental hea lth, as WHO currently defines mental health as \"not just the absence of mental disorder. It is defined as a st ate of well-being in which every individual realizes his or he r own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can 10 work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community\" (http://www.who.int). The shift fr om pathology and disorder to an emphasis on strengths and well-being has also been adopt ed by some Canadian mental health organizations. For instance, The Canadian Mental Health Associ ation (2010) provided a definition of mental health as \"striking a balance in all aspects of your life: soci al, physical, spir itual, economic and mental\" (http://www.cmha.ca). This empha sis on holism, that is, the recognition of various dimensions of health, is in greater alignment with many Indigenous cultures' understandings of health and well-being. Bo th Western and Indige nous conceptions of mental health and healing will be reviewed in greater detail in the following sections, but the definition of mental health that is info rming the current study includes an emphasis on strengths, holism, and well-being, as well as understanding of distress and disorder. Western Paradigm. According to Wilson (2001), the term paradigm refers to a set of values or beliefs that guide one's actions in the world. Stewart (2007b) states that the current dominant paradigm operating in the North Ameri can context is a Western paradigm, as it is based on Western culture. She defines Western cu lture as referring to the values of European settlers and their descendants, which consis ts of specific social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, specific artefacts and technologies, and a set of \"literary, scientific, musical, and philosophical principles which se t it apart from other civilizations...and whose history is strongly marked by Western Eu ropean immigration\" (Stewart, 2007b, p. 55). Western culture and a Western paradigm of thought are therefore understood to inform various aspects of historical and contemporar y North American tradition, custom, practice, and thought. The training and practice of the ma jority of North America's mental health 11 professionals therefore stems from a Western paradigm of thought. A Western paradigm of health therefore refers to: The dominant cultural attitudes and beliefs that are based on Western European philosophies and practices that inform counselling approaches and counsellor training in North America that are ba sed on individual psychology (Stewart, 2007b, p. 55). This definition is used throughout the remainde r of this paper when discussing or making reference to a Western paradigm of healing. Summary of Chapter One and Overview of Thesis The voices and experiences of Indigenous Elde rs are glaringly absent from the mental health profession's dialogue around the ongoi ng movement towards the integration of Indigenous and Western paradigms a nd approaches to healing. The aim of this research is to showcase the perspectives of these Elders, and to provide insight for helping professionals and organizations who seek to collaboratively work with Indigenous Elders and healers. In the first chapter of this thesis, I ha ve provided a brief background of the relevant issues related to the mental health needs of Canada's Indigenous peoples, my conceptual framework for the research, and a definition of terms. In Chapter Two, I provide a review of the literature in the following areas: a brief historical ov erview of Indigenous and Canadian relations, with an emphasis on the development of health related problems; information on the current health status of Indigenous peoples in Canada; We stern and Indigenous conceptions of mental health; th e role and work of Indigenous Elders; and an overview of the Indigenous and Western integr ated healing movement. In Chapter Three I present the methodology that is used in this research, and include a description of the procedures that 12 were employed in this study. The within-partici pant results are provi ded in Chapter Four, which includes a character sketch, comments on the first and second interviews with each participant, and the core message and themes fr om the individual interv iews. In Chapter Five I review the across part icipant results and analyses, focusi ng on perspectives and experiences with integration across the five participan ts. In Chapter Six I present my concluding thoughts, recommendations and implications of the research, and a summary of the study. 13 Chapter Two: Literature Review The present chapter contains a review of current literature rela ted to the research topic. I begin with a brief hist orical overview of Indigenous health in Canada, and current mental health indicators. A di scussion of Western and Indigenous paradigms and conceptions of healing follows. The literature related to the characteristics and work of Indigenous Elders in Canada is then reviewed, and I end with an overview of some of the underlying principles and contentious issues related to the integration of Indige nous and Western paradigms and practices of healing. A Brief Overview of Indigenous Health in Canada The following section outlines various components of the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in Canada pr ior to European contact, during and as a result of European contact, and will end with an overview of curre nt health indicators for Canada's Indigenous peoples. Health and well-being before European contact. Waldram (2004) has written critically of some authors' tende ncies to present a utopian view of ways of life and the health status of Indigenous peoples prior to contac t with European settlers in the late 15th century. Instead, he writes that both physical and mental health problems existed among various Indigenous groups of peoples during this ti me. For instance, Waldram, Herring, and Young (2007) stated that fungal, bacterial, and para sitic infections afflic ted Indigenous groups to varying degrees before contact. Waldram (2004) also stated that conditions which could be categorized as mental health issues existed duri ng this time, citing the existence of depression and suicide among the Mohave specifically. Ho wever, several key points related to the existence of these mental health issues must be addressed. 14 First, one must take into account the hist orical and cultural fact ors which inform the development and conceptualization of psyc hological phenomena, such as depression and suicide. For instance, Devere ux (1940), in his work with the Mohave, documented the psychological condition of Hiwa:Itck , or heartbreak (as cite d in Waldram, 2004). This condition was characterized \"by psychotic epis odes and which referred specifically to a condition of older men whose younger wives had left them\" (Waldram, 2004, p. 279). If one were to view this particul ar condition through a contempor ary Western lens, one may be tempted, for instance, to categorize this disturba nce as schizoaffective disorder. However, in doing so, one would fail to acknowledge the cu lturally based etiol ogical foundations and symptomatic expressions of the condition. Furthe rmore, in labelling and categorizing such conditions by Western standards and terms, one runs the risk of over-looking, or even disregarding, the cultural systems and practices that were in place to address such conditions of distress. Scholars would ther efore be wise to exercise cau tion when affixing labels and classifying Indigenous health phenomena as Wester n disorders, particularly the mental health conditions of Indigenous peoples prior to contact with European settlers. The second important point related to th e existence of health problems before European contact is that Indi genous peoples had specific heal ing systems and practices in place to address diverse pre-colonial hea lth concerns (Kim & Kwok, 1998; Kirmayer, Simpson, Cargo, 2003; Lee & Armstrong, Waldram, 2004; Waldram et al., 2007). For instance, Waldram et al. (2007) cite the use of the Shaking Tent and Sweat Lodge ceremonies as examples of healing methods that pre-date European contact. Waldram (2004), in discussing the occurrence of post-trauma tic stress disorder among Indigenous peoples prior to contact, referenced the Navajo Enem y Way Ceremony, which focused on healing the 15 trauma of warriors'. Waldram continues by asserti ng that the relative lack of current rates of post-traumatic stress disorder among Indigenous groups may be explained by the existence, practice, and transmission of ceremonies for trauma. The Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Pe oples [RCAP], 1996) cited the role and teachings of Indigenous Elders during pre-colonial times as a contributing factor for the maintenance of a well-balanced lifestyle and appr oach to health and healing. As a result of these various systems and approaches to heali ng, several authors have asserted that while health problems may have existed before contac t with European colonizers, they were far less numerous than the reported health problem s of Indigenous peoples today (Kirmayer et al., 2003; Waldram, 2004; Waldram et al., 2007). Health and well-being as a result of European contact. While the year 1492 has been identified as the starting point for relati ons between the first pe oples of Turtle Island and European settlers, Waldram et al., (2007) not ed that contact was es tablished at different times in different regions of North America a nd was principally linked to the establishment of the fur trade and missionary activities. It was estimated that over 7 million Indigenous peoples inhabited North America prior to cont act with European se ttlers, and that an estimated 90% of these individuals died as resu lt of both the direct a nd indirect effects of European settlement (Kirmayer et al., 2000). The introduction and spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, influe nza, yellow fever, among others, by European settlers has been cited as primary causes for the high death rate, as well as the change from traditional diet to a reliance on European foodstuffs (Kirmayer et al., 2000; Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peopl es, 1996; Stewart, 2007a; Wald ram et al., 2007). Physical health problems continued to develop and escala te over time, and a shift from infectious to 16 chronic diseases began during the 20th century. In addition to the various physical health problems that developed in response to European settlement, and that continue to persist today, many have asserted that a diverse num ber of mental health problems have also developed as a result of colonial efforts. Legislation that was designed to control and exploit, or \"deal with\" the Indian problem (Steckley & Cummins, 2001), had been er ected long before the founding of Canada in the year 1867. Two notable pieces of legislation, the Bri tish North America Act of 1867 and the Indian Act of 1876, enabled the Canadian government to classi fy Indigenous peoples as wards of the state; determine who may iden tify as 'Indian'; eradicate traditional forms of governance; secure title to the land and its resources; create reserves and force Indigenous peoples off their traditional land; and restrict and control essential components of healthy living, such as access to food, r ecreational activity, and the practice of cultural customs and traditions (including the use of healing pract ices and ceremony) (Kirmayer et al., 2000; Steckley & Cummins, 2001; Wald ram et al., 2007). In essence, the principal goal of this legislation was the assimilation of Indigenous peoples to Euro-Canadian beliefs, customs, and values. In addition to governmental legisla tion, missionary efforts that were designed to save the souls of Indigenous peoples and ci vilize the savage were rampant at this time (Steckley & Cummins, 2001). However, th e combination of governmental policy and missionary zeal resulted in one of the most abhorrent events in Ca nadian history: the establishment of the residential school sy stem, and stemming from that, a concerted, controlled, and legislated a ttempt at cultural genocide. It was hypothesized that one of the most effective ways by which assimilation could be achieved was the education of Indigenous ch ildren. Beginning in the 1880s, residential 17 schools began to flourish, and along with that, children began to be forcibly removed from their homes, separated from their families, and enrolled in these educational institutions. The curriculum included training in a range of s ubjects, including carpe ntry, shoemaking, sewing, knitting, and general household duties, and in ad dition to the above, children were taught to abide by Christian values and abandon any form of Aboriginal spirituality or custom (RCAP, 1996). Furthermore, Aboriginal languages were sp ecifically targeted for eradication, as they were perceived as a principal vehicle for th e transmission of Aboriginal culture. Children were thus severely disciplined, often physically abused, if any attempt was made to speak or retain their language (RCAP, 1996). Rampant physical, psychological, and sexual abuse has also been well-documented and narrated by survivors of the residential school system (Waldram et al., 2007), and in addition to thes e various forms of abuse, malnourishment, neglect, and medical crises (such as the sp read of tuberculosis), were terrifyingly characteristic of the residential school expe rience and environment (RCAP, 1996). Instead of producing a newly assimilated generation of Ca nadians, the graduates of the residential school system often found themselves on the peri phery of two distinct worlds, ill-equipped to navigate either completely. Efforts geared towa rds dismantling Aboriginal culture and family have continued since the introducti on of the residential school system, only changing slightly in policy and implementation. For instance, Indi genous children continued to be forcibly removed from their homes and placed in the care of the state as they were adopted and placed in foster homes, a time period commonly referr ed to as the Sixties Scoop (Kirmayer et al., 2003). The effects of these colonial efforts ha ve had long-lasting impacts for individuals, families, and communities as a whole. 18 As has been noted above, what could be ch aracterized as mental health conditions did exist prior to contact. However, given such legislative acts as the Indian Act, which prohibited the practice of Indigenous ceremoni es up until the early 1950s, one can imagine that the health and well-being of Indigenous pe oples during the early contact years only grew in complexity. Furthermore, the introduction of hazardous agents by European colonizers, such as alcohol, was arguably a significant c ontributor to the devel opment of new mental health challenges, such as substance us e and abuse (Waldram, 2004). The atrocities experienced by Indigenous peoples in the re sidential school system have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the mental health of the su rvivors of the school system, and many have argued that the sequelae of these events cont inue to impact Indigenous peoples today (e.g. Duran, Waldram et al., 2007). As Kirmayer et al. (2003) stated, Narratives and life histories suggest that the residential school experience has had enduring psychological, social and economic effects on survivors. Transgenerational effects of the residential schools include: the structural effects of disrupting families and communities; the transmission of explicit models and ideologies of parenting based on experiences in punitive institutional settings...repetition of physical and sexual abuse; loss of knowledge, language and tradition; [and] sy stematic devaluing of Aboriginal identity\" (p. 18). The impact of European settlement and coloni al initiatives has significantly transformed many aspects of Indigenous peoples' ways of life, health, and well-be ing. Current indicators of North America's Indigenous peoples are to be reviewed next. 19 Current health indicators. According to the 2006 Canadian Census, 1,172,790 people identified as Aboriginal (First Nations, M\u00e9 tis, or Inuit). Over the last ten years, there has been a 45% increase in the Aboriginal popu lation, with the M\u00e9tis e xperiencing the largest increase in number. The number of Aboriginal people living in urban areas also rose to 54%, a four percent increase from 1996. As of 2006, A boriginal people accounted for close to 4% of the total Canadian populat ion (Statistics Canada, 2008). Although the Aboriginal populat ion represents a small percentage of Canada's total population, they experience a wide range of h ealth problems at disp roportionately higher rates than non-Aboriginal peoples. For instance, they have a 6-7 times greater incidence of tuberculosis, are 4-5 times more likely to be di abetic, are 3 times more likely to have heart disease and hypertension, are tw ice as likely to report a long- term disability, and have a substantially shorter life exp ectancy than the non-Aboriginal population (Kirmayer et al., 2000; Kirmayer et al., 2003) . Health Canada (2009)1 recently reported that rates for both pneumonia and influenza were approximately four times higher among the First Nations population than the non-Indigenous population, a nd that in the year 2000, First Nations hospital separation rates were higher than the non-Indigenous population's for each of the following chronic diseases: ischemic heart dise ase, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The shif t from infectious to chronic diseases among Indigenous peoples has continued to grow in strength, as rates of cancer, diabetes, and AIDS have all increased over the past fe w decades (Waldram et al., 2007). In terms of mental health related concerns, Health Canada (2009) indicated that rates of intentional and unintentional injuries among th e First Nations population were four to five 1 Report presents information on the health service utilization of the on and off reserve First Nations population in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. 20 times higher than the non-Aboriginal popul ation, and the second leading cause for hospitalization among First Nations women was suicide/self-inj ury. Examples of additional mental health problems among some of Cana da's Indigenous peoples include depression, anxiety, violence and abuse, and other psychiat ric disorders (Kirmayer et al., 2003; Shah, 2005; Stewart, 2007a), and some scholars have also reported elevated rates of substance abuse, trauma, and suicide in certain co mmunities (Kirmayer et al., 2000; Shah, 2005). While elevated rates of both physical a nd mental health problems among Canada's Indigenous peoples have been repo rted, it is also important to recognize that much variability exists among Indigenous indivi duals and communities. For inst ance, Chandler and Lalonde (1998) found that while some First Nation commun ities reported rates of suicide that are 800 times the national average, the ac t of suicide is either very low or virtually unknown in other communities in British Columbia. While Cha ndler and Lalonde reported that cultural continuity is a significant factor for the occurren ce of suicide, the important point here is that many Indigenous individuals and communities posses strengths and community-based approaches which prevent and/or remedy ment al health problems. However, the vast majority of available mental health services in Canada are rooted in a Western paradigm and approach to health. Therefore, the majority of Indigenous peoples who seek help for mental health problems will be forced to access We stern mental health services. The common Western-informed practices and approaches th at are used with Indigenous peoples will be explored in the next section, along with the barr iers for the effective use of these practices with Indigenous peoples. 21 Western Conceptions and Approaches to Mental Health In order for the reader to have an in formed understanding of the issues surrounding integrated (Indigenous and Western) mental health service delivery, a thorough examination of both a Western and Indigenous paradigm of mental health and healing is required. Beginning with the Western paradigm, the follo wing section will review Western informed conceptions of mental health and the ps ychotherapeutic process, common Western approaches used with Indigenous peoples, and indicators and e xplanations for the ineffectiveness of Western approa ches with Indigenous peoples. It is also important to note that while some generalizations have been ma de in reference to Western conceptions and mental health practices, these comments reflec t the theory and practi ce techniques that are currently offered in the majority of mainstream training institutions and mental health service organizations in Canada. Western conceptions of mental health. One of the principal texts used by Western trained mental health professionals is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), currently in its fourth edition. The majo rity of mental health practitioners (psychiatrists, ps ychologists, psychotherapists, so cial workers) receive, at a minimum, training in the theory of this text, and those with more advanced degrees skilfully learn how to assess and diagnosis individuals in accordance with its criteria. What is strikingly evident, even from its title, is that mental health in a Western context tends to be defined in relation to disorder; that is, the ab sence of disorder is often an indicator of good mental health. In the opening introduction of th e text, a definition of mental disorder is provided: 22 Mental disorders have also been define d by a variety of concepts (e.g. distress, dysfunction, dyscontrol, disa dvantage, disability, inflexibility, irrationality, syndromal pattern, etiology, and statistical deviation)...each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a c linically significant behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that o ccurs in an indivi dual and that is associated with present distress...or disability (American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p.xxx). Based on the above definition, it b ecomes clear that there is a te ndency to pathologize mental health problems into mental health disorders, and to locate the cause for the disorder internally with the individual. What is striki ngly absent from this definition is a commentary or consideration of how other dimensions of one's social location, such as cultural, social, or historical factors, may contribute to the de velopment or understandi ng of mental health problems. While cultural considerations are made note of later on in the introductory comments, and how a clinician may work within the cultural frame of reference of their client, the emphasis remains on privileging a pathological perspective in defining and conceptualizing mental health. Lewis-Fernandez and Kleinman (1994) wr ote that three culture-bound assumptions bias conceptions of mental health in North Am erica: the egocentricit y of the self, mind-body dualism, and culture as an arbitrary superim position on a knowable biological reality. The concept of an egocentric self suggests that \"psychological normality and abnormality are internal to the self,\" implying that the responsib ility for one's mental health lies solely with the individual, without an examination of ex ternal contributing fact ors (Lewis-Fernandez & Kleinman, 1994, p. 67). The second assu mption, mind-body dualism, speaks to the 23 fragmentation of an individual. For instance, a clear distinc tion is often made between the physical health, mental healt h, and spiritual heal th of a person, with various personnel assigned to treat each component of the individua l separately (medical doctor, mental health practitioner, religious/spiritual figure). And lastly, Lewis-Fernandez and Kleinman noted that culture tends to be viewed as consisting of a se t of beliefs that are s uperstitious in nature, which leads to the \"discounting of the disease categories, illness expe riences, and healing practices of people in other cult ures, reducing them to the status of obstacles in diagnosis, treatment compliance, and outcome\" (p. 67-68). McCabe (2008), an established Indigenous scholar, echoed the arguments made by Lewis-Fernandez and Kleinman in discussing the Western mental health system's preference fo r a scientifically informed approach which strives for an objective and value-free encount er between practitioner and client, and which tends to segment an individual in to pathological dimensions. This is in stark contrast to the holistic, socio-culturally informed, and wellne ss based conception and approach to health and healing that is adopted by many Indigenous cult ures. Having explored th e principles of the majority culture's conception of mental healt h, I will now explore how such notions inform a Western model of treatment, specific ally the psychotherapeutic endeavour. Western psychotherapy. The principles of pathology, autonomy, modernity, and a dichotomous splitting of the mind and body often translate into a therapeutic encounter that can be characterized by several key qualitie s. First, a strong emphasis is placed on the capacity and intrapsychic processes of the i ndividual client in c ounselling (LaFromboise, 1988). The client is viewed as the target of change in the therapeutic work, as opposed to other units (e.g. family) or syst ems (e.g. Canadian child welfare system) that the client may be a part of and that may be contributing to mental health distress (C onstantine et al., 2004). 24 A practitioner may spend time evaluating and assessing the client's intrinsic properties through the use of psychodiagnostic tools, and interventions are desi gned to facilitate individual change. A strong emphasis is also placed on the relationship between the client and mental health practitioner, and the quality of this relationship is often cited as one of the most effective elements that supports the client in therapeutic change. While mental health practitioners may consult with other health prof essionals, or refer their clients for additional treatment, the current structure of the Western healthcare system is one which supports the splitting of an individual into segmented pieces. For instance, a client who wishes to process a sexual assault and who has lost faith in her religion would most likely be referred to a medical doctor, a mental health worker, and a religious figure, who would all work individually with this woman. It is easy to see how achieving an integrated understanding of oneself and one's well-being may be difficult as a result of this fractured process. Western mental health practiti oners also attempt to remain value-free and assume an objective position throughout the therapeutic process (L aFromboise, 1988). The obvious contradiction is that each pract itioner undeniably hol ds values which have informed their perspective and their approach to their work. Even the act of attempting to remain value-free represents a value-laden position, a position wh ich has been informed by Western modernist principles of objectivity, rationa l thought, and the constancy of measurement (Constantine et al., 2004). The above stated quali ties that are characteristic of the Western therapeutic enterprise also appear to transcend specific th erapeutic modalities. For instance, an emphasis on autonomy and the mind-body split can be seen in the therapeutic frameworks of both 25 cognitive-behavioural therapy and narrati ve therapy. A discussion of the common psychotherapeutic modalities employed with Indigenous clients will be reviewed next. Western psychotherapy and Indigenous peoples. Different therapeutic approaches have been used with Indigenous peoples w ith varying degrees of success. Two Western therapeutic modalities that have been used w ith Indigenous clients, and that have been discussed in the litera ture, are cognitive-beh avioural therapy (CBT ) and narrative therapy. Renfrey (1992) has argued that the action orientation and direc tive nature of CBT appears to be congruent with the needs, values, and e xpectations of many Native American clients. Rayle et al. (2006) have suggest ed that narrative approaches in counselling ar e ideal when working with Indigenous clients because of the oral tradition and emphasis on story and legend that is characteristic of many Indigenous cultures. However, a growing body of evidence is beginning to challenge assertions that the sole us e of Western psychotherapy is the most effective treatment strategy fo r Indigenous peoples. For instance, Jackson, Schmutzer, Wenzel, and Tyler (2006), in invest igating the preferences for and endorsement of cognitive-behavioural therapy among Amer ican Indian and European American participants, found that while American Indi an clients rated activity scheduling, homework, and present-focused treatment favourable, an emphasis on uncovering the relationship between one's thoughts and feelings, identify ing cause-and-effect relationships, and a structured therapeutic relati onship were undesirable qualiti es. While a more plausible argument may be that certain components of We stern psychotherapies are ideally suited to the values and needs of Indigenous clients, what has become strikingly clear is that significant problems and challenges remain in the effective delivery of and retention of Indigenous peoples in Wester n mental health services. 26 Many researchers, scholars , and practitioners have voiced statements that Western mental health services have largely faile d Indigenous clients (e .g. Duran, 2006; McCabe, 2008; 1996; Moodley & West, 2005; Stewart, 2007a; Vica ry & Bishop, 2005). This belief has developed in response to res earch that has demonstr ated an under-usage and high drop-out rates from counselling, and st udies which have investigated Indigenous peoples' perceptions and attitudes towards the counselling process. For instance, Sue, Allen, and Conaway (1978) found that 55% of Native Am ericans did not return for mental health support after an initial co nsultation. O'Sullivan, Peterson, Cox, and Kirkeby (1989) conducted the same study 12 years later and found that Native Americans had the second highest failure to return rate compared to Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian American populations. And lastly, Shah (2005), in examining the health status of Aboriginal people in Ontario, found that 78% of the First Nations population consid ered their health between good and excellent, compared to 90% of the non-A boriginal population, and that 50% of First Nations people in Ontario do not believe that th ey receive the same healthcare services as the general Canadian population. In terms of Indigenous clients' perceptions of Western mental health services and quality of care received, Harris, Edlund, and Larson (2005), in i nvestigating rates of mental health problems and the use of mental health care services across ei ght different ethnic populations in the United States, found that wh ile Native American individuals reported the highest rates of mental health problems, they also reported the highest levels of unmet need when discussing mental health services. A study conducted by Vicary and Bishop (2005) found that Australian Aboriginal peoples per ceived Western psychotherapy as culturally inappropriate or irrelevant, a nd lacking validity when used w ith Aboriginal peoples. And 27 finally, Price and McNeill (1992) , in investigating attitude s towards Western counselling services among 74 Indigenous individuals, found th at participants strongly committed to their tribal culture had less confidence in mental health professionals a nd had significantly less favourable attitudes toward seek ing counselling services. Taken t ogether, the resu lts from the above studies clearly in dicate that there are inherent shor t-comings in the Western mental health system when trying to service Indigenous peoples. This has led scholars to investigate and identify factors in the Western psychothe rapeutic enterprise th at are proving to be detrimental to the counselling expe rience of many Indigenous peoples. Factors for low Western therapeutic engagement among Indigenous peoples . Several different explanations have been put forward in atte mpt to illuminate the short- comings of Western mental health services in servicing Indigenous peoples. One of the most commonly cited challenges is th e absence of an Indigenous worldview in the healing process (Duran, 2006; McCormick, 1996; Stewart, 2007a) . In recognizing that a vast amount of diversity exists among the worldviews of the Indigenous peoples of North America, a few over-arching similarities have b een highlighted in the literature . Some of the key values that tend to comprise an Indigenous worldview include the importance of relationship and interconnectedness among all things (humans, an imal and plant world, the ancestral or spirit world, and the cosmos) (Garrett & Wilbur, 1999 ; McCormick, 1996); the role of family and community (Kirmayer et al., 2000; Stewart, 2007 a); and an emphasis on balance and holism, in both relationships and the four sacred aspects of the self (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual) (McCabe, 2008; Poow assie & Charter, 2005). While the absence of an Indigenous worldview in the counselling process may be a deterrent for many Indigenous clients to continue with counselling work, Duran (2006) argues that the imposition of a Western 28 worldview and approach to healing is a cont inued form of oppressi on and hegemony: \"Lack of understanding of the Native epistemological root metaphor (ways of being in the world, including psychological and spiritu al worlds) continues to hind er our profession. Historical narcissism (the belief that one's own system of thinking mu st be used to validate other cultural belief systems) continue s to be an issue in the relationship between Original People and those who hold power in the academic and c linical life-world\" (p. 10). Undeniably, a fundamental divergence in understanding and valu es between client and practitioner poses a significant challenge for successful healing work , and the responsibility of ensuring that the counselling process is aligned with the client 's worldview rests with the practitioner. A second obstacle to the effective delivery of mental health serv ices with Indigenous peoples is culturally insensitive practitioners and assessment tools. Duran (2006) stated that stereotypic images and representations of Indi genous peoples in the media bias a great deal of the work of Western clinicians. He also not ed that the use of a Western mental health paradigm increases the risk of over-pathol ogizing Indigenous clie nts, and Johnson and Cameron (2001) stated that misdiagnosis is almost assured given current assessment instruments. Even the DSM-IV-TR of the Amer ican Psychiatric Association (2000) suggests that clinicians conducting diagnostic assessmen ts may \"incorrectly judge as psychopathology those normal variations in behaviour, belief, or experience that are particular to the individual's culture\" (p. xxxiv). While strides have been made in increasing awareness and developing culturally competent practice stan dards for counselling with ethnic minority clients (e.g. Sue, Arredondo, & McDavis, 1992), some state that training in Indigenous specific conceptualizations and approaches to healing is n eeded (e.g. Stewart, 2007b; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). 29 Additional challenges which may impact the likelihood of therapeutic engagement with Western services include fear of stigmati zation, difficulties with establishing trust, and access and availability of mental health serv ices. Vicary and Bishop (2005), in interviewing 70 Indigenous individuals in Western Australia, found that participants reported being fearful of the Western mental health system and bei ng stigmatized or labell ed as mentally ill. Participants stated that their first line of treatment was community-based approaches, seeking treatment from the immediate family, Elders, or healers first, and accessing Western mental health services as a last resort . In a similar vein, Oetzel et al. (2006) found that 46% of their 224 participants, located on three different reserves in the United States, identified privacy concerns as an obstacle in their treatment when accessing alcohol, drug, or mental health services. Privacy focused on the participants' desire for others to not know about their treatment use, and the authors asserted that the concerns with privacy stemmed from the participants perceived stigmatizat ion of alcohol, drug, and mental health disorders. Oetzel et al. also found that 45% of thei r participants identified commu nication and trust issues as obstacles in their treatment, particularly wh en accessing services for emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. Johnson and Came ron (2001) also asserted that establishing trusting relationships with both individual practitioners and larg er institutions poses a great challenge for many Indigenous clients, and in addition to that, access and availability of services remains an issue, particularly for I ndigenous peoples located in rural or isolated communities. One final and significant element of the heal ing process that appear s to define healing for many Indigenous peoples, whic h is absent from Western c onceptualizations and methods for healing, is spirituality and a belief in a higher power (Mail, McKay, & Katz, 1989; 30 McCabe, 2007; McCormick1996; Stewart, 2008; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). Duran (2006) writes, \"Most Native People believe that they ar e more than just the cognitions that flow endlessly through the realm of awareness, and it is in these 'other' asp ects of the personality where there may be a place in which therapy/he aling needs to happen\" (p. 20). While a more detailed analysis of Indigenous conceptions of me ntal health is to follo w in the next section, the above presented information up to this point illustrates that the stru cture, conception, and delivery of current Western-informed mental hea lth services are inade quate in servicing and retaining Indigenous peoples in the treatment process. While components of the Western mental health system are assuredly effective a nd beneficial to Indige nous clients, the task will be to identify these effec tive elements and redefine the treatment and healing endeavour as both Indigenous and Western appro aches begin to merge together. Indigenous Conceptions and Approaches to Mental Health In the following section I will review I ndigenous conceptions and understandings of mental health, Indigenous models of heali ng, including a review of traditional healing approaches, and studies that ha ve investigated Indigenous peopl es' perceptions and rates of use of Indigenous healing methods. As was noted in the previous section, a vast amount of diversity exists among the 600 Indigenous Natio ns of Canada. However, some over-arching similarities around conceptualizatio ns of health have been identif ied in the literature, and will be reviewed here. Indigenous conceptions of mental health. One of the most commonly identified defining features of Indigenous conceptions of he alth is the notion of holism and balance. An individual is viewed as consis ting of four dimensions, the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual, and it is the balanci ng of these four aspects of the self that constitutes good health 31 and well-being (Garrett & Wilbur, 1999; Poonw assie & Charter, 2005; Waldram, Herring, & Young, 2007). If one of these dimensi ons is out of balance, for example, if an individual is not eating healthily or routinely, the remaining three aspects of the person will be impacted, and the person may become unwell. Imbalance in one dimension is therefore often perceived as the root source for the development of h ealth problems, and the goal of much healing work is to re-establish balance and harmony am ong the four aspects of the self (Garrett & Wilbur, 1999). What becomes clear from this view of the self is that the various dimensions of health (physical, mental, spiritual) ar e not viewed as independent entities, but interconnected elements that comprise an individu al's health. It is for this reason that some Indigenous people struggle to define mental health concretely, because mind-body dualism is not a concept that is readily endorsed by many Indigenous cu ltures (Vicary & Bishop, 2005). As was just noted, spiritual health is one of the four di mensions of well-being. This particular dimension, however, is often considered to be one of th e most critical pieces to an Indigenous person's healing, and something that te nds to be identified as absent in Western mental health approaches by Indigenous pe oples (McCabe, 2007; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). For instance, McCormick (2005) writes \"One of the major distinctions between Aboriginal healing and Euro-Western healing is the role th at spirituality has in the healing process. For Aboriginal people, spirituality is central...Spirituality takes on such an important role in healing that it is seen as the essence of healing for many Aboriginal people\" (p. 294). Spirituality and spiritual work will mean a nd encompass different things for different individuals. However, one's rela tionship with a higher power, often referred to as Creator or Great Spirit, relationships with different spirit beings and ancestral spirits, and one's own spirit, are elements of spiritua lity that are often central to healing work (Garrett & Wilbur, 32 1999). Many authors have spoken of the impact of historical and interg enerational trauma on Indigenous peoples today, (e .g. Brave & DeBruyn, 1998; Menzies, 2008; Wesley- Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004), and some believe that if healing services are to be effective with Indigenous peoples, efforts mu st be focused on healing at the soul or spirit level, or as Duran (2006) referred to it, he aling at the soul wound level. One model which encapsulates an Indi genous conception of health, and the importance of relationship and interconnection with all entities, is the Medicine Wheel. Originating with the Plains Natives (Stewart , 2007a), and varying in design and cultural meaning based on the Indigenous nation and co mmunity it comes from, the Medicine Wheel is comprised of four distinct quadrants, typically housed within the shape of a circle, that often represents the four asp ects of the self, the four dire ctions, the stages of human development, and other beings which humans have relationships with (animals, plants, spirits) (McCabe, 2008; McCormick, 1996; Poonwassie & Charter, 2005). In a study conducted by McCormick (1996), in which he in terviewed 50 First Nations people in British Columbia, participants identified the Medici ne Wheel as a First Nations philosophy of healing, as it illustrates the importance of a ttaining balance, harm ony, and interconnection with oneself and other entities. Participants also identified relationship and interconnection among and between all things as a key component to the health of Firs t Nations peoples. An Indigenous individual's relationshi p and involvement with their Indigenous community has also been cited by scholars as a significant contributi ng factor for mental health and ., 2003; LaFromboise, 1988; McCormick, 1996; Stewart, 2008). Stewart (2008), in interviewing five Indigeno us counsellors about their conceptions of Indigenous mental health, found that participants iden tified community as a 33 necessary and specific component of mental health and healing for Indigenous peoples. Community was understood as any group to whic h an Indigenous individual belonged (including, but not limited to, ancestral and tr aditional communities) and that had some link with Indigenous culture. McCa be (2007) wrote that a key component of the traditional healing practices of many Indigenous commun ities is to introduce or reintroduce the individual to the community, which \"connotes identity and seems to be accomplished by the use of group experiences and reminders that one 's community and family are intrinsically connected to an individual's wellness\" (p. 157). Kirmayer et al. (2003) have also noted the importance of community connection, stating that Indigenous culture s tend to be more collectivistic in nature, and that individuals will find strength and solution s to health concerns from community networks and members. An obvious challenge, however, is that many Indigenous individuals find themselves displ aced from their traditional cultures and communities as a result of the colonial process. As Stewart's participants noted, part of the healing work and the job of the mental health practitioner is to support the client in bridging connections to Indigenous community and culture . If an Indigenous client does not have a strong connection to their community, they ma y also have a weaken ed sense of cultural identity, which has also been identified as an important component of Indigenous mental health and well-being. Indigenous identity was identified as a principal site of attack by European colonizers. Indigenous individua ls were informed by colonizer s that their ways of life, culture and traditions were savage and unciv ilized, and that the obliteration of their Indigeneity was the answer to the advan cement of their peoples (Waldram Herring, & Young, 2007). According to Hodgson (1990), this hi storical legacy of colonial domination 34 has resulted in feelings of shame and wort hlessness for many Indigenous peoples about themselves and their cultures (as cited in St ewart, 2007a). Culture may be understood as the \"dynamic system of rules, explicit and implicit, established by groups in order to ensure their survival, involving attitudes, values, beliefs, norms, and behaviours\" (as cited in Schneider, Gruman, & Coutts, 2005, p. 333). Not surprisingl y, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates that a strong sense a nd affiliation with Indigenous culture, and possessing a cultural identity, are vital aspects to securing hea lth and well-being for many Indigenous peoples. Goudreau, Weber-Pillwaw, Cote-Mee k, Madill, and Wilson (2008) i nvestigated th e effects of a cultural hand-drumming practi ce on the four dimensions of well-being among a group of seven Aboriginal women. The findings demons trated that the hand-drumming practice was effective in creating change and fostering healing in the four s acred aspects of the self. For example, the women reported that hand drum ming enabled them to gain a greater understanding of their cultural traditions. It al so increased their sense of self-efficacy and confidence as they began to share these teachi ngs with other Aborigin al peoples and use the hand drum as a teaching tool in ceremonies, workshops, and classrooms. Cultural identity was also something that Stewart's (2008) participants, Indigenous mental health practitioners, identified as being an explicitly necessary for the mental health of Indigenous peoples: \"Having a clear Native identity is part of attaining and maintaining mental health; the act of finding or strengthening Native ident ity is what healing is about\" (Stewart, 2008, p. 15). Acts through which cultural identity may be strengthened or developed include a connection with one's cultural community and fa mily, participation in cultural activities, such as receiving traditional te achings from the Elders or participating in ceremony, and learning and speaking one's Native language. Ho wever, strengthening a sense of cultural 35 Indigenous identity can be a challenging task fo r several reasons. First, time and effort may have to be devoted to processing the inte rnalized oppression and racism that some Indigenous individuals may ca rry. Another challenge is whether an individual has connections with their ancestral culture and community. Given the importance of both community and culture to the mental hea lth of Indigenous peoples, mental health practitioners are encouraged to explore the wa ys in which they can support their Indigenous clients in strengthening their relationships with culture and their sense of identity. Practitioners must also be mindful to not assume that all Indigenous clie nts are interested or have identified their cultural background as an important as pect of their healing or therapeutic work. Just as a mental health prac titioner would do with a ny client, the clinician must meet the client where they are at in their healing work and support the client through the psychotherapeutic process by allowing them to identify key goals and issues that they would like to address, which may or may not include an emphasis on developing cultural awareness and identity. Having re viewed some of the key elemen ts that comprise Indigenous conceptions of mental health and well-bei ng, I will now explore how these understandings are translated into Indigenous fram eworks and approaches to healing. Indigenous models of healing. Several authors have demons trated through research how Indigenous notions of mental health inform Indigenous mode ls or approaches to healing. The first three models examine how Indigenous conceptions of health and healing may inform the practice of psychotherapeutic approa ches to healing. I will then explore traditional Indigenous healing approaches as an additional method for m eeting the healing needs of Indigenous peoples, and the rates of use of traditional approaches. 36 McCormick (2005) detailed a conceptual path for healing based on his research which investigated the healing experiences of Firs t Nations peoples in British Columbia, Canada. He identified four stages in the healing journeys of many In digenous peoples, which include (1) separating from an unhea lthy life (2) obtaining social support and resources (3) experiencing a healthy life and (4) living and main taining a healthy life. In the first stage, an individual recognizes unhealthy ways of bei ng and removes themselves from the unhealthy practices to examine how the problem beha viour is impacting or compromising the individual's well-being. The sec ond stage entails establishing c onnections with others as the individual seeks support in overcoming their proble m. In the third stage, an individual begins to incorporate healthier aspects of living into their life, such as pa rticipating in ceremony, establishing a spiritual connec tion, and anchoring oneself in their traditions. McCormick writes that the feeling of integration with one's culture that is characteristic of this stage \"provides a strong sense of di rection and belonging\" (p. 303). And in the final stage, the individual works to maintain and integrate the lessons and ex periences from the earlier stages as they continue with a healthier life pat h. Elements of holistic exploration, community involvement, and strengthening cult ural identity are all represen ted in the various stages of this model. While McCormick noted that empirical support for this model has not been attained, it nonetheless demonstrates how the va rious elements that comprise health in an Indigenous context may be organized a nd incorporated into healing work. In exploring how Native counsellors con ceptualized the inters ection of Indigenous cultural conceptions of mental health and c ontemporary counselling practice, Stewart (2008) interviewed five self-identified First Nati ons and M\u00e9tis individuals who worked in a counselling or support capacity w ith Native clients at an Indi genous social service agency. 37 The counsellors had been trained in Western approaches to professi onal counselling, but as was illustrated by the findings, consistently integrated Indigenous conceptions and approaches to healing in their work. The results from the study yielded a Model of Indigenous Mental Health and Healing that consisted of four components: community, cultural identity, holistic approach, and inte rdependence. As has been noted above, the role of community in the attainment and maintenan ce of mental health for Indigenous peoples is key. Counsellors suggested that healing cannot occur if the client does not have any connections with a community. Community was understood to be a component of a holistic balance which the client is often working towa rds, and healing work may in fact focus on supporting the client in estab lishing or strengthening their connections with community. Developing or strengthening cultur al identity is the second component of the model, and was perceived as the crux of healing work for ma ny Indigenous clients. Counsellors identified participation in traditional healing practices as a way to strengthen cultu ral identity, and also identified the need to incorporate traditional healing into Western counselling services. The third element of the model was utilizing a holistic appr oach in the counsellor's healing work with their client. Employing a holistic appro ach meant examining the healing needs of the four dimensions of the individual equally, and not ignoring or solely focusing on one area at the expense of the others. Exam ples of how the holistic model was used in practice included having food available in the counsellor's office, using prayer and ceremony during counselling sessions, and taking clients into nature or the community. And lastly, interdependence reflected the belief that rela tionship and relying on others is an inherent piece of an Indigenous worldview. The relatio nship between client and counsellor was therefore identified as a signifi cant element to healing work. Furthermore, the counsellors 38 noted that given the importance of relationshi p in healing work, they require support from mainstream health services to connect clie nts with other resources and supports in the community. Once again, the outlined model of Indigenous health presented by Stewart illustrates how some of the key determinants of mental health for Indigenous peoples can be integrated into mental health practice. The couns ellors asserted that su ch practices should be integrated into Western mental health services to more adequately serv ice Indigenous clients. Finally, McCabe (2007) conducted interviews with four traditiona l healers and four participants of traditional healing practices to identify the therapeutic conditions of traditional healing approaches. While the mode l is based on healers' and participants' experiences with tradit ional healing, McCabe used the info rmation from his participants to present what he referred to as a \"home-gr own\" Aboriginal psychot herapy method (p. 158). The results of the study produced twelve therap eutic conditions: (1) r eadiness to heal; (2) understanding inner and unknown experience; (3) le ssons of daily living; (4) challenges to change; (5) empathy; (6) acceptance and respect; (7) role modeling; (8) genuineness, credibility, and legitimacy; (9) tr ust and safety; (10) the sacred teachings; (11) ceremonies and rituals; (12) belief in the healing spirit. While an explanation of each of these conditions is beyond the scope of this pape r, it becomes evident that the various elements of Indigenous conceptions of health and well-being are presen t in these therapeutic conditions, such as a belief in the healing spirit, exploring culture through sacred teachings, and exploring the various dimensions of well-being throughout th e healing process. Furthermore, McCabe's participants also identified what many Western me ntal health practitioners consider to be the essential conditions for the practice of Western psychothe rapy. These include empathy, acceptance and respect (commonly referred to as unconditional positive regard), genuineness, 39 and establishing a trusting and safe environm ent. While McCabe ar gued that altering Western therapies to meet Indigenous peoples' needs is not the ideal solution, I would argue that McCabe's findings support cu rrent integrative efforts in the professional helping field. However, I believe that McCabe suggests, to wh ich I would agree, that merely incorporating Indigenous elements into sta nding Western practice is not th e ideal solution. What must occur is a melding of healing paradigms, wh ere multiple worldviews and ways of knowing and healing are accepted as valid and legitimate, if integrative efforts are to be at all successful. One of the most commonly discussed approaches to healing within an Indigenous paradigm is the use of traditional healing pr actices. It is not unco mmon for researchers and practitioners to suggest that Western practitioners collaborate or consult with Indigenous healers or Elders about incorporating traditiona l components of healing into therapeutic work (e.g. Constantine et al., 2004; Sue, Arre dondo, & McDavis, 1992; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). The practice of traditional healing ap proaches is next to be reviewed. Indigenous traditional healing. A myriad of definitions and understandings exist around the term and practices that constitute tr aditional healing (e.g. Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy, 2002; Hill, 2003; Wyrostok & Paulson, 2000; Waldram, 2004). For instance, Waldram et al. (2007) commented th at no agreed upon definition of traditional healing exists, but that the term generally re fers to practices that include psychological, physiological, and spiritual elements that center around healing. Dura n (2006) writes that traditional healing consists of ancient forms of healing that have evolved and been passed down through the generations. One definition provided by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) (1996) summarizes some of principa l elements associated with the term and practice of trad itional healing approaches: 40 Practices designed to promote mental, phys ical and spiritual well-being that are based on beliefs which go back to the time before the spread of western 'scientific' bio-medicine. When Aborig inal Peoples in Canada talk about traditional healing, they include a wide range of activities, from physical cures using herbal medicines and other remedi es, to the promotion of psychological and spiritual well-being using cer emony, counselling and the accumulated wisdom of elders (p. 348). Traditional healing typically refers to the pr actice of Indigenous forms of healing, which include the use of cultural teachings, ceremony, a nd specific healing practices that originated with the First Peoples of Tur tle Island, and that have been successively passed down through the generations. While the term traditional healing is commonly used in literary and scholarly circles, both Native and non-Native scho lars and community members have voiced critiques and concerns with the term itself, and the implie d authenticity of the know ledge and practices it purports to include (i.e. the idea that traditio nal knowledge and practices have not changed over time or been impacted by colonization). For instance, Waldram (2004) highlighted how the term traditional has come to be socially constructed throughout time when he wrote, \"'Traditional' as an adjective has changed from a descriptor of a particular kind of ancient cultural formation or individual cultural orie ntation/lifestyle into a metaphor, and an oppositional one at that, for a particular kind of very contemporary lifestyle and identity, in which culture is no longer as much a lived experience as it is a practice or even a performance\" (p. 292). In commenting on this metamorphic process, Waldram highlighted the importance of recognizing that traditional knowledge and practices have been greatly 41 impacted by colonial efforts, and that tradit ional healing itself may refer to and connote a healing practice that while rooted in I ndigenous knowledge, may ha ve evolved in its contemporary form of practice and expressi on. Hill (2003) also commented on the term 'traditional' when noting that the term was orig inally introduced by British colonial forces, and that it is disliked by many Indigenous groups today. A group of Elders and healers that were brought together by the National Aboriginal Health Or ganization (NAHO) to discuss contemporary challenges facing the practice of traditional medicine made it explicitly clear that they felt uncomfortable with the term \"traditional medi cine\" and thought it was not an Indigenous concept (Hill, 2003). According to this group of healers, Indigenous medicine and healing refers to: A way of life and a collective dynamic. It is spiritual, expressed through the land and ceremonies, and therefore holis tic. Definitions included everything from diet, lifestyle, identity, knowledge of language and culture and expressions of love and comfort (hugging and smiling), positive verbal reinforcement, herbal and ritual knowl edge, and spiritual doctoring. In short, traditional medicine is connected to all spheres of human activity and good medicine is laughter, good thoughts and a good state of being. Elders and healers were frequently reminding one anot her that it is not a western 'medical' concept disconnected from culture, families, and community (Hill, 2003, p. 24). Hill highlighted several key points related to co nceptions of Indigenous health and healing: (1) One achieves good health thr ough a way of being and living that focuses on relationship and holism; (2) The term medicine in an Indige nous framework refers to a diverse system of sources and practices for healing (which incl ude ceremony, laughter, identity, and culture) 42 and (3) Indigenous conceptions and practices of health and healing are markedly and significantly different than Western notions of health, medicine, and well-being. An exploration of some of these practices and approaches to he aling will be reviewed next. Indigenous practices for healing . It is important to be gin by recognizing that each Indigenous community has and uses their own approaches and methods for healing. Furthermore, sources for healing are found in everyday occurrences, such as speaking with friends or laughing. Garrett and Wilbur ( 1999) expand on the aforementioned notion of Indigenous medicine, where medicine refers more broadly to a diverse array of methods for healing. These may include the use of herbs and ceremonies, but can also be found in the plant and animal world. As Garrett and Wilbur wr ite \"Medicine is everywhere. It is the very essence of our inner being; it is that which gives us inner powe r. Medicine is in every tree, plant, rock, animal, and person. It is in the li ght, the soil, the water, and the wind...There is medicine in every event, memory, place, pers on, and movement. There is even Medicine in 'empty space' if you know how to use it\" (p. 197/ 8). This understanding of medicine is in obvious contrast to Western biomedical not ions of medicine, where pharmacological responses are often the first line of treatment for illness or distress. Indigenous ceremonies are most frequently di scussed in the literat ure as examples of Indigenous methods of healing. Some ceremonies are facilitated by traditional healers and/or Elders in the community, and the type of ceremony to be performed will depend on the nature of the presenting problem by the indivi dual who is in need. Some of the ceremonies most commonly discussed include the Sweat L odge, Vision Quest, and various dancing and drumming ceremonies (e.g. Francis, 2004; Goudr eau et al., 2008; Jilek, 2004; Smith, 2005). While some research has examined the ther apeutic elements of these ceremonies (e.g. 43 Goudreau et al., 2008; Heilbron & Guttman, 2000; Wagemakers Schiff & Moore, 2006), with favourable results for the empirical efficacy of these practices, conducting research on these traditions remains a contentious issue at best. Some of the concerns related to researching Indigenous practices include the documentation of sacred traditional knowledge and employing a Western research paradigm to examine effec tiveness (Gone, 2010; Waldram, 2000). Some have asserted that exercising such caution around researching ceremonies stems from a colonial history in which much I ndigenous culture, includi ng ceremony, was outlawed and banned between 1880 and the mid-twentiet h century (Hill, 2003; Waldram, Herring, & Young, 2007). Additional concerns are related to the appropriation of Indigenous knowledge and ceremonies by New Age enthusiasts and the cap italist market. Some authors have written about the importance of securi ng the intellectual property righ ts of Indigenous knowledges as mainstream forces continue to seek out a nd capitalize on the resour ces of many Indigenous communities (e.g. Battiste and Henderson, 2000). Two final methods for heali ng that I am going to highlight include the use of story and story-telling and the work of Elders and healers. Severa l authors (e.g. Mehl-Madrona,, 2005; McCabe, 2008; Weber-Pilla x, 2001) state that most Indigenous communities and cultures are based on oral tradition, and that st ory-telling plays a central role in both the transmission of knowledge and the healing of individuals. As McCabe (2008) writes, \"Traditional Aboriginal healing is very much the telling of story. The narrative of one's experience and understanding is connected to th e inner dialogue of the mind, body, emotions and spirit and makes the connect ion between the client and he aler\" (p. 146). As McCabe alluded to here, it is the pe rsonal telling of story, the shar ing of story with others, and oftentimes the receiving of storied teachings El ders and/or healers, th at can facilitate an 44 individual's healing. As has b een mentioned above, the use and facilitation of Indigenous ceremonies and practices is often done by heal ers and Elders, and th ey therefore play a critical role in the transmission of Indigenous knowledge and healing practices, in addition to the actual performance of such ceremonies. As will be reviewed in the next section, it is fairly common for individuals to access Indigenous healing system s, either independent of or in conjunction with, the use of Western treatment methods. Rates of use of Indigenous healing methods . LaFromboise (1988) asserted that the use of traditional healers among many American Indian tribes in the United States is the principal form of treatment accessed. Vicar y and Bishop (2005) conducted qualitative interviews with 70 Australian Aboriginal indivi duals to examine attitudes and beliefs related to mental health, Western psychotherapy, and the healing process. Partic ipants reported that traditional forms of treatment were preferred over Western mental health services, and Western services would only be accessed if necessa ry or as a last resort. Instead, participants identified a community-based approach to healing in which the individual's family, community, Elders and traditiona l healers comprised the primar y network of care to address the health problem or concern. One study which examined perceptions and le vels of involvement with traditional healing practices in a Canadian context was conducted by Wyrostok and Paulson (2000). The participant sample consisted of 99 First Nations students studying in postsecondary institutions in Edmonton, Alberta. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire which examined 14 different aspects of Indigenous healing practices. Wyro stok and Paulson found that overall, respondents expressed a strong inte rest in traditional hea ling practices and over four-fifths said they would lik e to learn more. Participants also strongly supported the idea 45 that traditional healing practices should not be forgotten, and felt that Native healing practices could be as helpful as Western me dicine. And finally, 80.8% of the participant sample reported previous experience with va rious traditional hea ling practices, including participation in the Sweat Lodge, Pi pe, and Shaking Tent ceremonies. A final study which examined rates of tr aditional healing method use was conducted by Kim and Kwok (1998). The authors investigated the use of Native healers by Navajo peoples located on a reserve in New Mexic o. Participants were recruited through an ambulatory care clinic at a rural Indian Health Service hospital located near the reserve. The findings revealed that 62% of th e participants had used a Native healer at least once in their lifetime, with 40% of the participants accessing th e services of healers on a regular basis. The services of healers were most commonly obtained to address problems related to arthritis, abdominal pain, depression/anxiet y, and chest pain, and those w ho consulted with healers for depression/anxiety were less li kely to obtain Western health services. While numbers for concurrent use of both Wester n and Indigenous health prac tices were not reported, the participants indicated that they had accessed both services simu ltaneously, as 21% stated that the medical provider and Native healer had pr ovided conflicting recommendations for their healing or treatment. The majority of indivi duals who received conflicting treatment plans attempted to follow both sets of advice from the Western and Indige nous practitioner. The main barrier to accessing the services of a Native healer was cost, and one third of the participant sample said they would use tradit ional services more often if they had the economic resources to do so. As has been demonstrated by this study, and the others reviewed above, Indigenous peoples continue to access the services of Indigenous healers and Elders and healing methods in contemporary contexts. Given Elders' central role in the 46 healing process, and their reputation as cultur al and spiritual leaders in their communities, obtaining the perspectives of thes e individuals on the current tre nds in mental health practice and services for Indigenous peoples is warranted and needed. The following section will review some of the major roles and responsibilities of Indigenous Elders. Indigenous Elders In the following section, current underst andings of the role and work of North American Indigenous Elders are outlined. It is important to note that the process by which one comes to be identified as an Elder will vary across Indi genous communities, and different Indigenous groups have different te rms to refer to someone in the position of cultural leader or wise one. For instance, among the M\u00e9tis people, the term Senator is bestowed on individuals in rec ognition of their know ledge and insight, yet it carries the same meaning as the term Elder, which is us ed among many First Nations (RCAP, 1996). Defining the role of Elder. No single definition of the term or work of an Elder exists. The definition process becomes even more clouded as the term elder may also refer to someone who is elderly, or a senior citizen in Western terms. However, referring to someone as an Indigenous Elder is qualita tively different than an elde rly person in the community, and several authors have ventured to provide de scriptions and unders tandings of the key characteristics and attribut es of Indigenous Elders. Stiegelbauer (1996) outlined the findings of her dissertation research which focused on examining and identifying the role and work of First Nations Elders in urban community organizations in Toronto. In terms of defining the role of an Elder, she noted \"Elders are important for their symbolic connection to th e past, and for their knowledge of traditional ways, teachings, stories and ceremonies...In a sens e, Elders are 'experts on life.' Their exact 47 expertise may be dependent on the nature of th eir experience, but in one way or another it involves some aspect of traditional knowledge and culture, or an interpretation of their experience in traditional terms \" (italicized in orig inal; Stiegelbauer, 1996, p. 40-41). What is evident from this definition is that tradition, culture, and wisdom are all key elements to the role and identity of an Elder. The Report of the Royal Commi ssion on Aboriginal Peoples contained a chapter on the role of Elders among Indigenous commun ities. The report stated that the culture, traditions, language, and rituals of the First Peop les of Turtle Island were orally transmitted through the generations, and Elders played a cr itical role in this knowledge transmission system. Elders are perceived as having clos e relationships with the Creator, and are considered \"exceptionally wise in the ways of their culture and teachings of the Great Spirit\" (RCAP, 1996, p. 110). Elders are often understood to have received gifts from the Creator and these gifts are to be used for the gr eater good of the Elder's community and when healing or assisting individuals who seek out th eir counsel. It was also noted that it is the responsibility of the community or individuals in need to se ek out the guidance and counsel of the Elders, as they are perceived to be \"t he conscience of the community\" and are rooted in the morals of the Creator (p. 111). Ellerby (2005) identified and differen tiated between three types of Elders: Community Elders, Elders as he alers, and Elders as teachers . He defined a community Elder as someone who has gained a great deal of lif e experience and possess a wealth of practical knowledge. The wisdom of this Elder may or may not be related to spir itual matters, and the community Elder does not typical ly facilitate or conduct heal ing practices; they are most often consulted about cultural practices and knowledge, such as traditional hunting patterns 48 or diet. The second type of Elde r, Elder as healer, tends to sp ecialize in traditional healing practices, such as the use of Indigenous medicines and performing ceremony. An Elder teacher is someone who focuses on the sharing of cultural and spirit ual teachings and who may be viewed as a mentor or spiritual lead er by their community. Ellerby wrote that both the Elder healer and Elder teach er provide healing services, but through different means: the Elder healer tends to focus on medicines a nd ceremony, whereas the Elder teacher heals through the sharing of trad itional teachings, story, and spiritual guidance. Some authors have also identified specific characteristics that most Elders tend to embody. These include being able to speak thei r Native language and know their culture's traditional ways and teachings; are humble and use humour; lead by example and incorporate traditional ways of living into their lifestyle; can be either male or female; have overcome personal hardships and difficulties that inform their work as an Elder; are evolving individuals who continue to learn and grow; have committed themselves to working towards the betterment of their peoples; and sust ain the oral tradition of their communities (Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy, (1996) also provided an itemized list of the principal qualities which ch aracterize the role and work of an Elder: 1. Is knowledgeable about tradition including cerem onies, teachings, and the process of life; is ideally a speaker of a Native language 2. Lives those traditions 3. Is old enough to have reached a stage of expe rience at which it is appropriate for them to communicate what they have le arned from life and tradition 4. Is recognized by the community for their wisdom and ability to help 49 5. Is still an individual with varying knowledge and skills 6. Is able to interpret tradition to the needs of individuals and the community 7. Is often asked to represent Fi rst Nation views as symbols of the culture or through active involvement with issu es and individuals. In summary, Indigenous Elders pos sess a diverse range of skills which translate into different types of work and activities. Common elements to most Indigenous Elders include a broad depth of knowledge about their culture's tradi tions and practices, str ong relationships with other beings (humans, plants, animals, spiritual relations), are viewed by their community as sources of wisdom and guidance, and their counsel or specific abilities (such as healing or story-telling) are often sought by both individu als and the community at large. Having reviewed some of the defining features of the role and work of Elders, I will review the process by which one comes to be identified as an Elder. Becoming an Elder. As mentioned above, the process by which an individual comes to be viewed and identified as an Elder vari es and depends on the indi vidual person's life experiences and journey. For instance, learni ng of one's traditional teachings and cultural practices may be a life long experience for some , whereas for others, a pivotal moment or encounter in which they are bestowed gift s or called by the Creator signifies their commencement into training and healing work (Constantine et al., 2004; Stiegelbauer, 1996). Ellerby (2005), in writing a manual on how to work effectively with Indigenous Elders, stated that while no formal education or trai ning programs, such as those found in Western institutions, exist for to-be Elders, the tr aining process for Elders is often rigorous, demanding, and life-long. For inst ance, to-be Elders often appr entice with other Elders or healers starting in adolescence and continue this training for many years, often returning to 50 their mentors throughout their lif etime for further skill develo pment and the honing of their gifts. For example, Ellerby wrote, \"a person may spend years learning about one particular herbal medicine - where it's picked, what it's called in different places, how it's used in a wide variety of circumstances, how it is prepar ed and how to relate to it spiritually, with respect - before being allowed to administer it for the first time\" (p.20). Furthermore, Ellerby stated that Elders are expected to have embarked on their own personal healing journey, achieving mental, spiritual, emotional, and physic al balance and wellness, before being able to counsel or heal others. The training process for many Indigenous Elders can be characterized as a life-long expe riential journey in which specif ic skills and personal qualities continue to evolve and develop in response to di fferent life experiences. The Elders in Stiegelbauer's (1996) study identified a learning process that was sparked by a personal, spiritual, or political event which led them to an intensive study of their traditional ways. These Elders then de scribed being called upon by their community to share their learnings and teachings, and as suc h, were recognized by their community as wise ones and teachers. Several authors have comm ented that the only way to truly achieve recognition as an Elder is th rough identification by one's Indi genous community (Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy, 2002; RCAP, 199 6; Stiegelbauer, 1996; Waldram et al., 2007). Identification as an Elder by one's comm unity is often viewed as a benchmark by Indigenous groups and organizatio ns for ensuring that a \"tru e Elder,\" as Couture (1996) refers to them, is in good standing. Various aut hors and organizations have made reference to ill-equipped or inauthentic h ealers and Elders (e.g. Abor iginal Healing and Wellness Strategy, 2002; Hill, 2003; Stiegelbauer, 1996), no ting that the prestige and status inferred upon Elders is desirable by many (although it is often perceived as an undesirable 51 characteristic by \"true Elders\"). This has led some healing initiatives and organizations who retain the services of Indigenous Elders, su ch as the Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy of Ontario (AHWS) (2002), to develop protocols and procedur es that are designed to ensure the reputability of their Elders, while also outlining disciplinary measures for malpractice or incidental harm that may be experienced by the client or knowledge seeker. This leads to a discussion of the specific practices and work of Indigenous Elders, which is to be reviewed next. Work of Indigenous Elders. Some of the work activitie s of Elders have been described above. For instance, one of the principa l expectations of an Elder is that they are the bearer of their culture's traditional know ledge, teachings, and practices (Stiegelbauer, 1996; RCAP, 1996). One of the main services that they provide is to share these teachings with individuals who seek to learn about their culture. Elders often play a pivotal role in keeping their Native languages al ive, and often provide instruc tion for learning the language as well. A second prominent area of work for Elders is healing wo rk. This may include performing or facilitatin g certain ceremonies, using plant medicines, sharing teachings or story-telling, and offering spiritual guidan ce (Anishnawbe Health Toronto, 2000; Ellerby, 2005). It is important to remember that Indigenous Elders practice from a holistic perspective, and so while they may have particul ar gifts and areas of ex pertise, they will still pay close to attention to the mind, body, and spiritual needs of the individual. Indigenous Elders have also identified the area of educati on as particularly important to their work, as they strive to educate the younge r generations about Indigenous ways and historical realities (RCAP, 1996). They have also become fairly involved in the just ice system, providing a variety of services to inmates and the admini stration system alike, including offering or 52 facilitating healing circles, participating in community sentencing circles, and acting as justice of the peace (RCAP, 1996; Waldram, 1997). It is this exact divers ity of skill, breadth of knowledge, and status within the Indi genous community that has resulted in recommendations for the collaboration betw een Western professiona ls and Indigenous Elders. The following section wi ll explore the movement toward s integrated mental health services for Indigenous peoples, and the benefits and challenges of doing so. The Integrated Healing Movement In the following section I will review va rious aspects of the current movement towards integrating Indigenous a nd Western paradigms and practi ces of healing. First to be outlined is the concept of integration or hybr idity, and arguments for why integration should occur. I will then discuss the various levels at which integration may occur, which includes a melding of healing paradigms, epistemological ly hybrid practitioners, integrated mental health programs, and collaborations with heal ers and Elders. The fina l point of discussion will center on the challenges of integrating services, and the section will end with a summary of Chapter Two and the rationale for the current research study. Defining integration. One of the principal authors th at has practiced and written theoretically on integrated ps ychotherapy with Indigenous peoples is Duran (2006). In his text Healing the Soul Wound , Duran outlined the philosophical tenets of what he referred to as hybrid psychotherapy. He stat ed that the term hybrid emerge d from postcolonial thinking and refers to the idea that there can be two or more ways of knowing, and that these different views can exist harmoniously with one another. He stated his belief that the mental health profession must transcend the practice of cultu rally sensitive psychot herapy and engage in what he called epistemological hybridism, which is the ability to think or see the truth in 53 more than one way (Duran, 2006, p. 14). The adop tion of an epistemologically hybrid stance implies that the mental health paradigm and i ndividual practitioners ta ke \"the actual life- world of the person or group as the core truth that needs to be seen as valid just be cause it is. There should never be a need to validate this core epistemology or way of knowing by Western empiricism or any other valida ting tool\" (Duran, 200 6, p. 14). Embracing and practicing hybrid psychotherapy therefore imp lies that a mental health practitioner create space for the expression of diverse forms of know ing and healing, while being able to accept the client's beliefs, perspectiv es, and experiences as legiti mate, valid, and authoritative sources of truth and knowledge. This theory fo r integration allows bot h the practitioner and client to meet together and e xplore the client's worldview, and identify the healing needs and preferred methods or strategies for healing work. It is this exact collaborative and conceptually flexible space which allows for the co-occurrence, integration, and acceptance of both Western and Indigenous healing knowledges and practices. While Duran (2006) discussed how multiple forms of knowing and healing may come together in harmony, other authors have spoken a bout the incorporation of traditional healing methods into Western mainstream counselling approaches. For instan ce, Moodley and West (2005), in reflecting on the overw helming failure of the Wester n mental health system to service ethnic minority clients, and in que stioning whether the abandonment of Western services is the only viable option for oppressed peoples, stated \"We do not think that this is the answer. We believe that a creative move(m ent), a small paradigm shift - the inclusion and integration of traditional healing methods into mainstream counseling and psychotherapy...will also add a new lease of life to psychotherapy and counseling generally\" (p. xvii). Gone (2010) questioned how the inte gration of such healing methods can occur 54 however, when stating that it would be hi ghly unlikely, even undesirable, for doctoral students to receive training in the facilitation of healing cerem onies. At the same time, he stated that superficial alterations to mental h ealth services, or in other words, \"conventional programs with some feathers and beds thrown in\" (Waldram, 2004, p. 286), will also not adequately address the required re visions that are needed in West ern mental health services. I would echo the assertions of Duran (2006) in argu ing that integration at a paradigmatic level is required if an authentic merging or collaboration be tween Indigenous and Western methods and professionals is to occur. Given that Indigenous methods for healing have been successfully employed by Indige nous communities and peoples fo r thousands of years, one may question why an integration of healing paradigms is needed at all. Rationale for integration. Two primary arguments for th e integration of Indigenous and Western mental health systems are the fail ure of Western mental health services to adequately serve many Indigenous peoples ' needs (Harris, Ed lund, and Larson, 2005; O'Sullivan, Peterson, Cox, and Kirkeby 1989; Sue, Allen, and Conaway 1978), and Indigenous peoples' perceptions of and attitude s towards Western mental health services (Price & McNeill, 1992; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). Pri ce and McNeill (1992), in investigating attitudes towards Western counselling servi ces among 74 Indigenous individuals, found that participants strongly committed to their tribal cu lture had less confidence in mental health professionals and had significantly less favour able attitudes toward seeking counselling services. One may surmise that if traditional approaches to healing were made available in mainstream mental health or counselling sett ings, Indigenous indivi duals interested in pursuing traditional means for healing may be mo re likely to approach these services. If Indigenous clients can see West ern practitioners working coll aboratively with Indigenous 55 healers and Elders in these se ttings, one might imagine that obstacles related to developing trusting relationships between client and counsellor may be assuaged. A second rationale for the integration of services, which was discussed in previous sections of this review, is the absence of Indigenous worldviews from current Western informed mental health services. In additi on to the importance that a holistic approach, family, community, and culture play in the hea ling process of Indigenous peoples, is the role of spirituality. Fostering or strengthening spiritu al identity and spiritual relations with other beings (Creator, ancestral spirits , etcetera) has been identified as a core component of healing for many Indigenous peoples (McCabe, 2008; McCormick, 1996) and something that is glaringly absent from Western systems of hea ling. While Western systems of health tend to fragment the various dimensions of an individual into differe nt treatment sectors (medical, psychological, spiritual), the combination of Indigenous healers and practices with Western mental health services would pr ovide a holistically oriented a pproach to health and wellness for Indigenous peoples. While Indigenous healing systems, includi ng the services of healers and Elders, continue to be accessed and identified as a successful option for healing (Kim & Kwok, 1998; Maar, Erskine, McGregor, Larose, Su therland, Graham, et al., 2009; Wyrostok & Paulson, 2000), relying solely on Indigenous healers and Elders for healing is no longer a viable option. Some of the primary obstacles to accessing the services of Indigenous helpers include the cost and accessibi lity of traditional services (Kim & Kwok, 1998). Additionally, given the complexity of health, particular ly mental health challenges, among many Indigenous communities today, trad itional services alone may not be adequate to address new or contemporary mental h ealth problems. McAdam (2009) noted that the term \"sexual 56 assault\" does not exist in the Cree language because its occurrence was relatively unknown among the Cree people before European contact. Given that certain ment al health challenges were virtually unheard of during pre-colonial times, such as the sequelae of sexual assault, traditional approaches that are designed to heal this type of distress may also be lacking. Research has also shown that some Indi genous peoples use both Indigenous and Western services simultaneously, but often fail to inform the helpers of their multiple service use (Kim & Kwok, 1998; Waldram et al., 2007). Th is poly-service use be comes particularly high risk when one considers the potential fo r interactions between Western and Indigenous medicines. Developing systems in which bot h Western and Indigenous practitioners are centralized would provide the c lient with greater treatment op tions, which would presumably increase the likelihood of I ndigenous peoples seeking and continuing with services. Centralized systems would also allow for communication, case consultation, and treatment planning between helping professionals, whic h would decrease the chance of a client receiving contradictory information or dire ction from the healers and practitioners. A final motivation for the integration of Indigenous and Western healing paradigms is that the two approaches have the potential to complement one another and enhance healing processes. For instance, McCormick (1996) stat ed that various Wester n psychotherapies, or elements of these modalities, may be used eff ectively with Indigenous clients. He gave the example of using emotion-focused therapies to facilitate the expression of emotion, but questioned whether the sole use of this orient ation would be suitable in and of itself with Indigenous clients. McCabe's (2007) study id entified 12 therapeu tic conditions that facilitated the successful impl ementation of traditional hea ling methods. Several of these conditions, such as empathy, genuineness, accepta nce of the client, r eadiness to heal, and 57 trust and safety also represent what many cons ider to be the core conditions of Western psychotherapy. One could argue that given the congruence between the required parameters for a successful healing encounter, some of the foundational elements for an integrated approach are already in place. If mental health practitioners or organizations are able to accept and operate from an epistemologically hybrid position, one can only imagine the various benefits and fruitful outcomes that are within reach for the individual client, Indigenous community, and the various helping professions. Having reviewed some of the conceptual tenets of integrated health serv ices, and the rationale supporting it, I will now explore the various levels and forms that integration may take, and provide case study examples of integrated ment al health interventions. Levels and forms of integration. As has been discussed above, one level at which integration may occur is the paradigmatic le vel. Duran (2006) write s that objectives and definitions of healing in Western and Indi genous paradigms are one in the same: the translation of psychotherapist is 'soul healer' and the task of the soul healer is to help individuals overcome psychopathology, which transl ates into 'soul suffering.' He feels that the primary objective for helpers is to recognize and \"engage in the healing tradition that is part of our genetic memory and be true to that tradition\" (Duran, 2006, p. 44). While a meta- level aligning of Indigenous and Western para digms of healing would be ideal, it seems highly unlikely that Western psychological governing bodies and training programs will abandon the Euro-centric model overnight, perhaps ever. While training programs may work to ensure that practitioners develop the appr opriate skills to be culturally sensitive or competent, this is still fundamentally different than a practitioner w ho is epistemologically hybrid and is able to accept mu ltiple forms of knowing and hea ling as valid and legitimate. 58 What is evident here is that paradigmatic in tegration may occur at either a meta or mirco level, where meta-level integra tion entails an aligning of philosophies within the discipline of psychology and Indigenous worldviews, and mi cro-level integration occurs among specific individual helpers/practitioners and organizations. If meta-level integration was to occur, one would conclude that the vast majority of i ndividual practitioners would be automatically trained in epistemological hybrid ism. However, given that the predominant form of training in many institutions is informed by Western st andards of practice and philosophy, the task of practicing hybridity often falls to individual practitioners and organizations. One area of contention within the integration field is whether mental health services (such as specific counselling and healing met hods like CBT and the sweat lodge) can be used conjointly if integration at the paradigmatic level has not occurred. For instance, Western practitioners, as part of culturally sensitive training procedures, are instructed to be open to client worldviews and values around healing, and the possibility of working or consulting with traditional heal ers and Elders (Constantine et al ., 2004; Sue, Arredondo, & McDavis, 1992). However, simply because a practitioner refers a client to the services of an Indigenous healer, or communicates with a healer from time to time, does not necessarily mean that the practitioner is practicing from an integrated stance, where Indigenous methods or healers are viewed as reputable sources of healing. For example, in examining the contact and the occurrence of referrals between Western trai ned nurses and Indigenous healers and Elders, Gregory (1988) found that 52% of the 10 nurses interviewed had referred clients to Elders, and 39% had referred clients to tr aditional healers. Indigenous heal ers also visited patients in the hospital, and occasionally spoke with the nursing staff. However, one participant quote 59 highlighted the Western elitism that many sc holars have referred to when commenting on Western helping professionals' acceptance of traditional forms of healing: She [medicine woman] came here to the nursing station and saw the patient and decided that he would need several tr eatments. We have a good medicine lady here. She's sophisticated enough to work with the nurses. You almost feel you are dealing with a professional (italics added, Gregory, 1988, p. 40). Criticism and scepticism of Indigenous heali ng methods, and the maltreatment of Indigenous healers and Elders, has occurred throughout hist ory, beginning with European contact in the late 15th century (Waldram et al., 2007). While the Western mental health system and its practitioners have made strides in terms of acknowledging and validati ng diverse systems of knowledge and healing, some author s have commented that tradit ional practices continue to be stigmatized and viewed as magical and i llegitimate forms of healing (Crowe-Salazar, 2007; LaFromboise, 1988; Waldram et al., 2007). Given the relative newness of the integrative healing movement, questions around how paradigms of healing and actual practices may be integrated continue to be pose d, and integrated interventions continue to be experimented with. Paradigmatic aligning re presents one level of integration, and the simultaneous use of Indigenous and Western met hods and helpers represents a second level. It has become a commonplace recommenda tion that Western practitioners remain open to the possibility of referring, consulting, or collaborating with Indigenous healers and Elders (e.g. Constantine et al ., 2004; & McDavis, 1992). Whether referring a client to an Indigenous healer, without the establishment of a formal relationship between the healer and clinician, constitutes a form of integrative service is questionable. Howe ver, consulting with Indigenous healers and 60 Elders to learn of a client's cultural background, developing a culturally-informed understanding of the presenting psychological issu e, or collaborating with healers in the design of a treatment plan (such as incorporati ng the use of ceremony as part of a client's healing work), are more suggestive and representa tive of an integrated approach to treatment and healing. A book chapter written by Shore, Shore and Manson (2009) represents one of the first written accounts of how Western mental health pr actitioners and Indigenous healers establish collaborative working relationships. These two helping professionals were brought together as they worked collaborativ ely in the treatmen t of post-traumatic stress among American Indian war veterans in the Northern Plains Trib es of the United States. The authors stated that the University of Colorado at Denver and the He alth Sciences Center's American Indian and Alaska Native Programs, in partnership with th e US Department of Ve terans Affairs, began establishing mental health clinics for American Indian veterans in 2001-2002. The clinics use live interactive videoconferencing, referred to as telepsychiatry, to allow psychiatrists to work with veterans located on rural reserves in the northern plains stat es. These clinics offer medication management as well as individua l, family, and group psychotherapy to 12 different tribes. Part of the initiative of these clinics, in providing cultu rally appropriate care, is to collaborate with local traditional heal ers. The authors noted that both formal and informal collaborations have developed with traditional healers, and that during the early stages of the clinic's establishment, psychiat rists made multiple trip s to the community to begin to establish relationships with comm unity figures, members, and healers. The psychiatrist, with the aid of a cultural informant that is part of the clinical team, attended community events such as pow-wows and sweat l odges. Participating in such events allowed 61 the psychiatrist to come into contact with healers and demonstr ate an interest in traditional activities and culture. Once the initial relationship with a healer had been established, the psychiatrist builds on this relationship by havi ng ongoing meetings with the healer. Examples of how therapeutic integration takes form in these clinics include case collaborations between the healer and psychiatrist to discuss models of healing, pe rspectives on symptoms, and the development of treatment plans, which in cludes the use of traditional healing, case consultation between the healer a nd psychiatrist on specific clients, and client referrals to one another. The authors noted th at clients are commonly referr ed to healers for certain ceremonies, such as the sweat lodge, which has proved to be an effective means of healing for American Indian veterans. It is also impor tant to note that client consent is obtained before any communication between the psychiat rist and healer takes place. The authors comment that this form of integrated care ha s proven effective for retaining Indigenous clients in mental health services and in the re duction of health problems. While this chapter provides insight into how inte grative efforts may take form , the experiences of such collaborations of both the Wester n professionals and Indigenous healers are absent. Speaking with either of these two helpers would prove be neficial in gaining a greater understanding of the exact elements of the integr ative process that are necessary for a successful collaboration, and any challenges that the help ers encounter in working togeth er, and how these challenges are then overcome. Obtaining the experiences of both Wester n professionals and Indigenous healers who work collaboratively with one a nother is a fertile area for future research. In addition to collaborations and integrated service delivery at the professional helper level are programs that have been designed and operate from an integrated stance. Integrated health programs have begun to increase over the last 20 years, as Toronto alone has seen the 62 emergence of Aboriginal Services at the Ce ntre for Addiction a nd Mental health, and Anishnawbe Health Toronto, a community hea lth centre which offers access to a diverse range of health care practitioners, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, traditional healers, Elders, and medicine people. While thes e clinics have begun to grow in strength and number, a paucity of research and formal docum entation exists which examines the strengths of these clinics and how they wo rk to successfully care for and retain their clients in their services. One example of an integrated mental health service which researchers (Maar, Erskine, McGregor, Larose, Sutherland, Graham, et al., 2009) have detailed is the Knaw Chi Ge Win service, a centre which provides healthcare for seven First Nations communities in the Manitoulin District of Northern Ontario. Knaw Chi Ge Win services are coordinated by two regional Aboriginal health organizations which place an emphasis on community-based Aboriginal approaches to care. The Knaw Chi Ge Win core team is made up of professionals working in the areas of psychology, nursing, so cial work, as well as a coordinator of traditional healing services who has expertise in the area of A boriginal medicine and healing. The core team is also complemented by visi ting consultants on a m onthly basis who possess expertise in the areas of psychi atry and traditional Aboriginal healing. The core team's home office is centrally located with in the region, and sate llite clinics are lo cated throughout the seven First Nations, and clients can access servi ces through either the home office or various clinics. Services are provided within a holistic Ab original framework that acknowledges the various dimensions of a person (physical, emoti onal, mental, spiritual), while also taking into consideration historical, socioec onomic, and cultural factors. When a new client approaches the centre for service, the core team reviews th e client's presentation and assigns them to the 63 most suitable healthcare provide r(s) (nurse, psychologist, et c.). Services are therefore coordinated at the outset of treatment, and the various providers consult with one another throughout the treatment process to coordinate and complement the healing work of one another. If the service providers feel that a client w ould benefit from a specialized psychiatric or traditional healing intervention, or if the cl ient expresses interest in traditional healing services, they are placed on a waitlist for the next available appointment with the visiting consultant. Team members atte nd psychiatric consultations and traditional healing services with their clients to ensure continuity of care and a collaborative approach to healing. To examine the strategies which support th e integration of these services, and the strengths and challenges of this approach to mental health service delivery, Maar, Erskine, McGregor, Larose, Sutherland, Graham, et al. (2009) conducted focus groups with community service providers (e.g. band managers , community health representatives), as well as individual interviews with clients a nd the Knaw Chi Ge Win core and consultant team members, totalling 54 participants, and co nducted a qualitative thematic analysis of the collected research data. Results demonstrated th at one strategy for the e ffective integration of Indigenous and Western healing is that professional helpers must have an in depth understanding of both systems of healing, a nd ongoing education around each system of healing is critical. For instance, one clinician commented \"We need to be working more with traditional models...when a person defines that that 's the way that they want to go...I think we can, [but] it's a difficult fit...You're trying to fit in something that just is not really well understood\" (Maar et al., 2009, p. 7). The develo pment of protocols around the delivery of traditional Aboriginal healing methods in this organization lifted \"some of the mystique that traditional medicine often embodies for clinica lly trained professionals\" and thus advanced 64 integrative practice (Maar et al., 2009, p. 7). C linicians reported higher levels of comfort referring clients to traditiona l services once protocols for tr aditional healing practices had been established. In terms of the reported benefits of th e Knaw Chi Ge Win ment al health service, improved quality of illness management, cultural safety, managed wait times, and reduction in professional isolation were identified. The au thors stated that a reduc tion could be seen in the number of patient admissions to acute care units in psychiatric hospitals, and attributed this reduction to finessed management of lo calized care and the stabilization of clients. Additional quality of care factor s included a client's ability to choose either Western or traditional approaches to heali ng and receiving services in th eir traditional language. Since clinicians in this service are open and accep ting of the use of traditional medicine, stigmatization of Aboriginal approaches to healing did not occur. The importance of acceptance of cultural practices wa s reflected in the clients' emphasis on feelings of cultural safety in the Knaw Chi Ge Win service, and this sense of cultural safety was identified as a significant marker of difference between the Knaw Chi Ge Win service and mainstream services. Some of the challenges of the Knaw Chi Ge Win service that were identified by the authors included under-funding of A boriginal mental health servic es, lack of qualified mental health professionals willing to work in this setting, and lack of co mmunity mental health data. While the listed challenges are assuredl y legitimate, investigating the challenges in communication or collaboration between professi onal helpers would have proved interesting and informative as professional helpers conti nue to attempt to successfully integrate and collaborate. It is particularly important to identify how challenges in integration are overcome, as numerous obstacles face practitione rs and organizations as they attempt to 65 integrate and collaborate. The final section of this review will outline some of the principal concerns and difficulties related to the integr ation of Indigenous and Western paradigms of healing. Challenges with integration. One of the most obvious challenges related to integration are the differences in epistemol ogical and conceptual unde rstandings of mental health and healing (Crowe-Sal azar, 2007; Gone, 2010). As has b een outlined in the previous sections of this review, significant differe nces exist between I ndigenous and Western paradigms of healing, including an emphasis on holism versus mind-body dualism, the role that spirituality, relationship, culture, and community play in each paradigm, and the formulation of illness etiology. For instance, Mo hatt and Varvin (1998) present an account of an 18 year old Objibwe woman known as H who accessed the services of both Indigenous and Western healers. During the course of H' s treatment, she received services from a Western trained psychiatrist , Lakota medicine man and wo man, and two Western trained psychotherapists who provided crisis interventi on. While H received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and was prescribed Lithium and Ch lorpromazine by Western practitioners, the Lakota healers' formulation of her problem was markedly different and was rooted in cultural understandings of illness: The indigenous conceptualization of her illness saw the problem not only lodged in her, but as reflecting problem s in her family, her peer-group, and her tribe, who were all in crisis...The sali ent elements in the indigenous conception of illness were thus problems of relationship between the spirit and the body and disruption in human relatedness. Her symptoms were, at this level, then 66 seen mainly as a consequence of her struggle with such problems, not as a cause of an inherent illne ss (Mohatt & Varvin, p. 90). Because of H's and her family's dislike of the Western approach and conceptualization of her \"illness\", they decided to access the services of the traditional healers in their community. Had H continued to receive both forms of tr eatment, without consul tation or coordination between the various helpers, she may have been put at risk as a re sult of the different treatment plans and approaches, specifically th e simultaneous use of Western and Indigenous medicine. Interactions between Indigenous a nd Western medicines and methods have been identified as an area of concern by practiti oners (Crowe-Salazar, 2007; Wieman, 2006), and if Indigenous and Western professionals stri ve to provide integr ated services, much consultation and negotiation would have to occu r in order to provide a cohesive treatment plan. This last point raises the issue of both Indigenous and We stern practitioners' willingness to collaborate and integrate their services. As has been mentioned before, Indigenous methods for healing are often stigma tized and viewed as illegitimate forms of treatment by many Western professionals (LaFro mboise, 1988; Waldram et al., 2007). At the same time, RCAP (1996) points ou t that Indigenous healers are entrusted with the task of healing in their communities, and for some heal ers and Elders, it is Western medicine that has become suspect. As RCAP (1996) noted, he alers and Elders \"have seen people become addicted to western medicines or be subjected to uncomfortable or painful treatments with little or no positive results\" (p. 13). Suspic ions and mistrust may therefore impede both groups of helpers in collaborating and integratin g their services. Part of this suspicion may stem from a lack of understandi ng and awareness of the work a nd approach that each helper 67 takes. For instance, Crowe-Sal azar (2007), in explori ng the experiences and perspectives of an Elder, psychologist, and ps ychiatrist, found that the psyc hiatrist, while supportive of a client's wish to access traditional healing servic es, would not \"go out of my way to say there is this person. I am not sure that would be my role and I don't know people [healers] well enough...the Psychiatrist is supportive but c ould neither recommend nor not recommend due to lack of information and resources\" ( p. 90). Likewise, Indigenous healers too have expressed ambivalence about refe rring and working with Western practitioners as a result of lack of information. Sima and West (2005) found that among a group of Tanzanian healers, referral was identified as a promising form of collaboration and integration, but the healers were unsure of how successful they would be at referring clients given their lack of knowledge about Western approaches to healing: \"I t is true that we can co-operate in the use of referral services, but we can still ask our selves how many traditional healers know what counseling is and how it works?...I have heard about counseling, but I as k myself few things like if we agree that we can co-operate in referrals, which problems shall I refer to counsellors?\" (p. 320). Education of each help er's healing paradigm, approaches and practices has been identified as a critical task when discussing the possibility of collaboration or integration. However, each practitioner a nd healer must be open to developing their cultural awareness and understanding of each a pproach, and be willi ng and interested in integrating their services. While developing cultural awareness and providing education about Indigenous practices is important, it is also imperative that one is mindful of resp ecting cultural protocols around the disclosure of sacred rituals, ceremonies, and teachings. As a result of Canadian legislation which outlawed the practice of many Indigenous healing traditions and increased 68 surveillance of Indigenous peoples and commun ities, much cultural knowledge and tradition was forced underground (Hill, 2003). Great strides have been taken to protect this knowledge throughout the decades and to also avoid pe rsecution, punishment, or exploitation today. Gone (2010) pointed out that many traditional healers may be relu ctant to disclose aspects of their approaches in detail which may be required for effective integration. An additional complication related to the disclosure of practices is the current movement towards evidence-ba sed practice in psychology, whic h promotes the idea that valid forms of treatment have an empirical ba se of evidence that documents their efficacy. Several problematic issues and points of concern have been voiced with regard to empirically evaluating Indigenous healing practices, including the use of a Western informed research paradigm, the documentation of sacred traditional practices, and identifying the variables which will determine efficacy (e.g. the succe ssful use, transmission, and practice of traditional healing practices over thousands of years cannot be ignored). In any event, the growing emphasis on empirical validation of ther apeutic interventions and practices has the potential to greatly impact how traditional he aling practices will be perceived and supported by Western healthcare systems, practitioners , and government funding agencies. While it seems highly unlikely that specific Aborigin al healing traditions will be empirically investigated and eventually lis ted as empirically supported trea tments by either the Canadian Psychological Association or American Psychol ogical Association (for reasons such as ownership of traditional knowledge), I believe that as the number of integrated mental health services increase across Canada, pr essures to ensure that treatme nts are in line with evidence- based principals will also con tinue to grow. A related concern to this is the bureaucratization of traditional methods. As Waldram (2004) and Gone (2010) noted, the institutionalization of 69 traditional practices and services of healers ha s the potential to result in the formalized surveillance of healers and traditional practices, and leads to concerns related to contracting the services of healers and El ders, remuneration of healers an d Elders, and documentation of traditional practices. Again, these various challenges and concerns must be taken into consideration and negotiated when considering the integration of mental health service delivery. One reason for increased demands for empiri cal support for specific treatments is to ensure that the potential for harm or risk to th e client is reduced, and that the best available course of treatment for the presenting issue is being employed. The issue of identifying skilled helpers, both Indigenous and Western, is always an important element in providing competent services for clients. However it b ecomes of central importance when attempting to integrate services together in what can be considered ground -breaking and eclectic ways. For instance, a vast amount of cultural dive rsity exists among Indigenous nations and communities, and each nation will have its ow n practices and teachings around healing. By centralizing, employing, or obtai ning the services of a specifi c Elder or healer, one must consider how cultural differences between the healer and client ma y impact the healing process. Mohatt and Varvin (1998) illustrated the challenges of cultural differences between healer and client in their case study of H. H was a young Ojibwe woman who accessed the healing services of a traditional Lakota medi cine man. Even though this medicine man was trusted by H's family, he had little knowledge of the Ojibwe community, and after the second day of this medicine man's ceremonies, a nd H's first sweat lodge, H became acutely psychotic with severe delusions and hallucina tions. While one cannot be certain of why H's health drastically worsened, the authors do note that the second me dicine woman that H 70 received healing from provided a different conceptualization of H's mental health difficulties, and different forms of treatment which proved successful in the reduction of her mental health distress. This example once agai n reiterates the importance of an individual receiving culturally appropriate care, by both Western and In digenous helpers and healers alike. Within an integrated context, the selec tion and employment of healers reveals a number of ethical and legal concerns for the organizing agency, professional helpers (Indigenous and Western) and clients. For instance, Waldram, Herring and Young (2007) pose the questions: What legal protection is affo rded to the agencies that employ Aboriginal healing? What legal protection is afforded to a healer? What legal protection does a patient have that undergoes treatment with an Abor iginal healer? (p. 255). Section 35(1) of the Ontario Regulated Health Professions Act (1991) states that the regulations of the act do not apply to \"aboriginal healers providing traditiona l healing services to aboriginal persons or members of an aboriginal community.\" Sin ce no equivalent regulatory document exists which outlines ethical standard s of practice for Indigenous healers and Elders, formal integration of Western and Indigenous methods b ecomes complicated, as the vast majority of Western professionals and organizations are bound by governing rules and regulations which must be upheld. While some organizations have recommended or inst ituted the de velopment of ethical protocols for trad itional healing and healers (e .g. Aboriginal Healing Wellness Strategy, 2002; Maar et al., 2009), concerns related to ethi cal practice and di sciplinary action for malpractice will continue to arise as atte mpts at integrated service delivery evolve. In summary, while some authors have expressed a belief that culturally sensitive Western psychotherapies may adequately serv ice Indigenous clients (e.g. Sue, Arredondo, & 71 McDavis, 1992), and others feel that Indigenous community-bas ed models of healing alone are adequate for the healing needs of Indi genous peoples (e.g. McCabe, 2007), calls and demands for integrated services, from both pract itioners and clients, continue to be voiced (e.g. Duran, 2006; Johnson, 2006; Maar et Charter, 2005; Shore et al, 2009; Waldram, 2004), and integrated mental health programs continue to grow in number and strength. Havi ng reviewed the conceptual underpinnings of integration, levels and forms that integration may take, current models of integration, and ongoing challenges associated with integrative efforts, the final segment of this literature review will summarize the key points outlined throughout Chapter Two of this thesis, and provide a rationale for th e proposed research study. Summary of Chapter Two and Rationale for Study The health status of the Fi rst Peoples of Turtle Island was markedly different than the health status of Canada's Indigenous peoples today. While health, and mental health, conditions and challenges were experienced by th e First Peoples, systems and practices for addressing and healing health issu es were in place. The introduc tion of new forms of disease, and the implications of colonial initiatives, such as the residential school system and attempts at the deconstruction of Indi genous culture, have arguably impacted and shaped current expressions of health and mental health issues today. While community-based and Indigenous healing practices continue to re-eme rge and grow in strengt h as a first line of treatment, the majority of Indigenous individu als who seek assistance in overcoming mental health problems access the Western mental health system. Shortcomings in the delivery of Western mental health services for Indigenous peoples have been evidenced by under-usage and high drop-out rates, and some have sugge sted that the integrat ion of Indigenous and 72 Western paradigms of healing may serve as a solution for adequate service delivery for Indigenous clients. However, given the distinct differences between conceptualizations, practices, and approaches to mental health tr eatment in Indigenous and Western paradigms, several questions remain around how integration is to occur and take form. Furthermore, calls for integration have most commonly been voiced by the Western mental health system and its practitioners (e.g. Constantine et al., 2004; Duran, 2006; Johnson, 2006; Moodley & West, 2005). The perspectives, experiences, and opinions of Indigenous healers and Elders are overwhelmingly absent from dialogues arou nd the integrated hea ling movement. While some Indigenous healers have been cited as pa rticipating in collaborative and integrated service delivery, the few studies which have em pirically examined the strengths, challenges, and successes of these integrated attempts have failed to obtain the perspectives and experiences of the professional helpers (In digenous and Western) who are practicing integratively. Given that it is the services of Indigenous healers, incl uding Elders, that are most commonly called upon when developing an in tegrated intervention, one must question how integration can occur if the perspectives of the Indigenous comm unity's leaders and healers are missing. If integration is to truly represent an ega litarian partnership in mental health service delivery, it is imperative that the narratives of the Indigenous community's leaders and healers be obtained at this point in time, during th e developmental stages of the integrated healing movement. The purpose of this study is to aid in this effort by qualitatively exploring the narratives, perspectives and expe riences of Indigenous Elders on current efforts to integrate Indigenous and We stern paradigms of healing. 73 Chapter Three: Methodology In this section I review the various components of th e research me thodology that were employed in this study, including an overview of the methodological framework informing the research, a review of my pers onal narrative and how it informs the research process, and information surrounding participant selection, procedures, an d the data analysis methods to be used. Qualitative Approach to Research A qualitative research paradigm was employed in the current research study. Qualitative research allows for in-depth insight and analysis of subjective and personal experiences, and as Morrow (2007) noted, qualitativ e research is \"the most useful approach to understanding the meanings people make of their experiences...Qual itative approaches are able to delve into complex processes and illustrate the multifacet ed nature of human phenomena. In addition, audience receptivity to a more narrative appr oach or presentation can often be an important reason to select a qualitative design\" (p. 211). Morrow highlighted the importance of selecting an appropriate quali tative method that enables the researcher to obtain the type of research data that will appropriately address and answer the research question, while also being cu lturally congruent for the pa rticipants involved. Many qualitative methods exists (e.g. grounded theory, discourse analysis), bu t given the nature of the research question, my partic ipant sample, and the conceptual frameworks that informed this research (Indigenous ways of knowing and social constr uctionism), it was determined that a narrative inquiry was the ideal qua litative method for the research study. The focus of this research was to examin e the perspectives of Indigenous Elders on current efforts to integrate Indigenous and We stern approaches to healing. The research 74 question was: What are Indigenous Elders pers pectives on the integrat ion of Indigenous and Western healing paradigms, and what, if any, are their experien ces of working in integrated contexts? As noted by Morrow (2007), research que stions that are designed to obtain rich and thorough accounts of phenomena, and questions that examine topics for which little research exists, are well-suited to quali tative approaches. Furthermore, Denzin and Lincoln (1994) pointed out that qualitative research entails studying \"things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, pheno mena in terms of the meanings people bring to them\" (p. 2). One of the goals of this re search study was to explore the meaning that Indigenous Elders make of inte grated mental health services and their personal experiences of working in integrated contexts. Narrative inquiry and rationale for approach. The depth and detail focus of the research question required a qualitative me thodology that emphasized co-construction and meaning-making in context. It is for this r eason that a narrative inquiry was employed. The method of narrative inquiry focuses on examin ing and understanding the meaning that people make of the world and their lives through the telling and re telling of story (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000). One of the basic underlying premises of na rrative-based approaches to theory and research is that individuals conceptualize and make sense of their identity, experiences, and the world through story (Clandinin & Conne lly, 2000; Mehl-Madrona, 2005; McAdams, 2004; Riessman, 2008). Many authors have noted that significant differences exist between the meaning and concepts of story an d narrative (e.g. Connelly & Clandinin, 1990; Richardson, 2000; Wiltshire, 1995). 75 Wiltshire (1995) differentiated between th e two terms by stating that stories are casual, informal, and exploratory, but can in fact morph into narratives. He stated, \"To become a narrative, a story must be conceptua lized, restressed, and completed. A narrative is conceptually more sophisticated and struct ured than a story...[they are] premeditated, organized, more formal, and have a structure that is their own\" (p. 78). Stories refer to the tales individuals tell about themselves and thei r endeavours, whereas narratives tend to refer to over-arching structured understandings that represent a synthesis of lived experience and the meanings that have been attributed and gleaned from experience (Connelly & Clandinin, 1990; Richardson, 2000; Wiltshire, 1995). Narrative inquiry was an ideal method for th is research project as most Indigenous peoples and communities describe themselves as having an oral-based story-telling tradition (see & Peden-McAlpine, 2005, Weber-Pillax, 2001). As has been discussed in the previous section, knowledge is often transmitted intergenerationally through story, an d story-telling has been identified as an important element of Indigenous culture a nd tradition (McCabe, 2008; Mehl-Madrona, 2005). Furthermore, given that the sharing of te achings and stories is one of the principal forms of work that Elders provide, a nd based on personal experience working and communicating with Elders, it can be anticipat ed with a fair degree of certainty that responses to interview questions would be communicated through the sharing of both personal and cultural stories. Finally, it was sp ecifically the stories, perspectives and experiences of Indigenous Elders that I sought to collect and showcase. Given the philosophical tenets of qualitative research and the c onceptual frameworks underpinning this study, a central principle which governed and informed the research was 76 that together, the participant and I co-constructe d the stories and narratives that were shared in the interview and research process. Baile y and Tilley (2002) discussed the importance of recognizing that participants wi ll share stories and narratives that convey meaning as they relate to the area of focus or research. They write, \"storyteller s select the components of the stories they tell (reconstruct) in order to convey the meaning they intend the listener to take from the story\" (Bailey & Tilley, 2002, p. 575). It was therefore my belief that each participant and I would collaboratively participate in the sharing and construction of stories that were meaningful and important in gaining insight into the overarc hing research question of this study. Since I would be actively participating in the co-construction of stories with my participants, it was important that I situate myse lf in the research process. In the following section I share aspects of my own personal stor y so that the reader may gain insight and awareness into how my own lif e experience informed and guided the research process. Research Process Researcher position. My maternal grandparents immigr ated to Canada from Europe (Hungary and Romania) in the early 1950s. My father's parents were both born in Canada, and their heritage has always been identif ied as Ukrainian (grandmother) and French- Canadian (grandfather). My pa ternal grandfather's Indigenous roots were typically never discussed by my family members as I grew up. During my adolescence, I can remember family members occasionally referring to them selves as Indian, or making comments that my interest in Aboriginal culture was because it \"was in my blood,\" but I never truly understood what my father's family were referring to. My grandfather passed away when I was very young, and because of my father's childhood experiences, my dad typically avoided discussing his family history. It ha s only been within the last year and a half that I learned of 77 my grandfather's identity as a M\u00e9tis man, a nd my identity as a M\u00e9tis woman. As I have worked on the various pieces of this thesis, I have also been working to gather the appropriate documents that I need to apply fo r M\u00e9tis Status. I have met with Indigenous Elders, among others, to discuss this process and my evolving identity. While this aspect of my heritage and history feels wholly right, I continue to st ruggle and negotiate how this element of my being connects and intersects w ith the other dimensions of my self. I am cognizant of how my identity may inform the development of my relationship with my research participants, and have sought counsel around how to share my personal story with my participants while maintaining appropriate boundaries. While I have participated in Indigenous events in the past, over the past year I have forg ed relationships with various Indigenous organizations throughout the university and larger Toronto community, and have sought the advice and counsel of various community members throughout the research process to ensure that proper cu ltural protocols are being follo wed. I continue to participate and dialogue with cultural informants to gain in sight into both my res earch work and my own healing journey. Participants . Participants were recruited throug h a recruitment letter (see Appendix A), snowball sampling technique, and my standing relationships with Indigenous organizations and Elders in the Greater To ronto Area. Recruitment consisted of my circulating a recruitment letter to Indigenous organizations in Toronto that provided cursory information surrounding the research study. I also r eceived referrals for po tential participants from community informants (individuals work ing in Indigenous organizations, Indigenous community members, etcetera) and the initial El ders that agreed to participate in the study. 78 Suggested referrals were contacted by phone a nd a telephone script was used in conversing with them about potential par ticipation (see Appendix B). Inclusion criteria for part icipation in the study consiste d of being recognized as an Elder by the individual's resp ective Indigenous community or the Indigenous organization that the individual was employed by. The El der must also be in good standing, and a determination of good standing would be provi ded by the community informant that was referring a particular Elder for participation. Bo th male and female Elders were eligible to participate. It is also important to note that in approaching Indigenous Elders, proper cultural protocols must be followed. Stig elbauer (1996) noted that when an Elder's advice or counsel is sought, an offering is made which symbolizes an exchange of gifts between the seeker and Elder (seeker's offering for the Elder's t eaching and knowledge). Both Stigelbauer and Anishnawbe Health Toronto (2000) identified tob acco as an appropriate offering, as it one of the Indigenous medicines used to facilitate communication between th e seeker, Elder, and Creator. Anishnawbe Health Toronto also sugge sts refraining from the use of substances (alcohol or drugs) at least four days before speaking with an Elder, and that women should avoid scheduling appointments with the Elder if they anticipate being on their moontime (menstrual cycle), as it is viewed as a cl eansing and ceremonial process that may interfere with the use of any medicines or communications with the spirit wo rld. It is also important to recognize that each Elder's culture will dictate proper cultural protocols that are to be followed. Before approaching an Elder to inqui re about their participation in the study, I inquired with the Elder themselves, or appropria te cultural informants, about proper cultural offerings and protocols that n eeded to be followed. Throughout th e research process, Elders 79 were presented with tobacco, or an appropriate cultural offering, at each encounter with me, acknowledging my request for knowledge and sym bolizing the exchange of information. A total of five participants (two male and three female Elders) were recruited for participation in the study. All five participan ts actively worked with the urban Indigenous community of Toronto in a variety of different ways (professionally and non-professionally) and contexts (community organizations, educationa l institutions, etcetera). None of the five Elders were originally from Toronto, but all maintained strong connections with their Indigenous communities and nations outside of Toronto. In honorarium of their participation, each participant received a bundled offering of medicines (sage, sweetgrass, tobacco, and cedar) (or a gift of similar value and significance that was more culturally appropriate) as a gift for their participation. Details concerni ng the individual recruitment process and the formation of research relationships with each pa rticipant will be reviewed in more detail in the results section. Procedures . Each phase of the research pro cess, including preliminary steps, interview processes, and data anal ysis methods, are described below. Preliminary phase . My research process began with my starting a research journal in which I tracked my personal thoughts and reflecti ons on the research process. I also began a field note log in which I documented my initia l consultations with community members who provided feedback on my proposed area of rese arch. Upon identifying a research topic and focus, I sought the counsel of Indigenous Elde rs, scholars, administ rators of Indigenous programs and organizations, and non-Indigenous sc holars and individuals. Any feedback or commentary that was offered by this collective of individuals was incorporated into my research design. I have also r outinely met with an Indigenous Elder to discuss the various 80 facets of this research project, and have r eceived feedback and approval from various Indigenous individuals and sources whom have collectively identi fied this research study as being important and valuable for the la rger Indigenous community of Toronto. Upon approval of my research proposal, a University of Toronto Ethics Application was submitted. This research project was also carried out in accordance with the First Nations Centre's (2007) guidelines for conducting research with Indigenous peoples. This document states that Indigenous peoples retain ownership, control, access and possession of all research data and research products re sulting from a study. Accordance with these principals ensures that the research participan ts experience a transparent research process in which they are informed about how the research data is going to be used, are able to refuse or decline participation at any point in the research process, and receive copies of their personal research data if they so choose. Participants al so received copies of interview transcripts and research reports for their review and were encouraged to provide feedback throughout the research process. Participants' approval of the final research findings w ill also be obtained before presenting or publishi ng the results of this study. Phase 1: In-depth interview #1. Interviews were conducted over a 1 to 2 hour time frame in a location that was convenient and identified by th e participant. I began the interview by reviewing the informed consen t form (Appendix C) verbally and in writing. Once informed consent had been establishe d, I presented each Elder with the bundled offering of medicines along with the over-archi ng research question that I was seeking knowledge for. Once the participants accepted th is gift, I reviewed my list of specific interview questions with each pa rticipant so that they were informed about the flow and structure of the interview. Any questions or c oncerns raised by the pa rticipant concerning the 81 interview questions were addr essed prior to turning on the audio-recorder. The following interview questions were posed to each participant in an open-ended and semi-structured fashion: 1. Can you share with me your story of b ecoming an Elder? How do you understand the work and role of an Elder? 2. What are your thoughts around combining Indi genous and Western forms of healing? What would you understand the strengths and challenges to be of doing this? 3. How do you envision this form of colla boration or integration taking shape? 4. What have been your experiences of working in co mbined or integrated systems, if at all? 4b. Have you encountered any obstacles/chall enges in working in these settings? 4c. Can you share with me times/examples of successful collaborations with Western organizations or practioners? What in your opinion contributed to making this a successful collaboration? 5. What guidelines would you suggest for Wester n organizations or practitioners who are interested in collaborating with Indigenous healers? Individual follow-up questions a nd prompts such as \"tell me mo re about that\" were used to encourage open-ended responses which facilita ted participants' narr atives. Upon completion of the interview, I shared the next steps to be taken in the research process (transcription of interview, analysis, etcetera), and provided them with an approximate date that I would get back into contact with them. Phase 2: Preliminary analysis . Preliminary analysis cons isted of a general process that included transcription of the interview, chunking of the intervie w into segments, coding interview segments, constructi on of a story map, and core message and theme identification. 82 This process can be conceptualized as taking the interview as a whole, breaking it down and reviewing the various elements and points of discussion, and th en integrating the distinct elements into a holistic and m eaningful whole through the use of a story map. Each phase of analysis will be reviewed in detail below. I began the data analysis phase by transcri bing each research interview verbatim. In this study, verbatim transcription entailed docu menting the commentary of each participant, along with personal inflections such as ahh, hmmm, pauses, laughter, and any other behaviours of significance, such as moving acro ss the interview space to select an Indigenous medicine for illustrative purposes. The inclusion of such personal inflections and behaviours was to preserve the richness and complexity of the interview. Once the initial transcription was completed, I re-listened to the intervie w in its entirety, following along with the transcript and making co rrections as needed. The second step in the analysis involved my chunking the interview transcript into smaller segments referred to as data units. Th e purpose of chunking the interview transcript within the context of this st udy was for organizational purposes that would facilitate cross- referencing within and between interview tr anscripts. Each data unit consisted of approximately 20-30 lines of sequential text, and an attempt was made to retain whole paragraphs of participant respons es within each data unit. Fi gure 1 depicts an example of a data unit used in the study Figure 1: Example of Data Unit Data Unit # Interview Transcript Corresponding Code 17 T - Thank you. Okay, so question number two, what are your thoughts around using Indigenous an d Western forms of healing together? And what would be the st rengths of doing that and what would be the challenges of doing that? 83 E1 - Ummmm... When you're in the bush, you're doing Indigenous medicines. Go with it, go with it, it works. We've done it all these years [Indigenous medi cine: Effectiveness]. Sometimes there's some things we can't, our medicines don't work, so they have Western medicine coming in and helping. That's good too. [Western medicine: Strengths]. So we don't turn down medicine; medicine medicine [Integration pe rspective: Both have strengths] Indigenous Medicine: Effectiveness Western medicine: Strengths Integration perspective: Both have strengths The third step involved coding the interview data. Glesne (1998) described coding as \"a progressive process of sorting and defini ng and defining and sor ting those scraps of collected data...that are applicab le to your research purpose\" (p. 135). Within the context of this study, codes were made up of one or two words and were derived inductively from the data; that is, the syntax or language used by each participant informed the labels or codes that were developed. I reviewed each sentence in the transcript and assigned what Glesne referred to as a major code. Major codes represent concep ts or central ideas that are articulated by the participant in a sentence. As not ed in the data unit in Figure 1, the major code of \"Indigenous Medicine\" was assigned to the following text provided by Elder 1: \"Ummmm... When you're in the bush, you're doing Indigenous medicines. Go with it, go with it, it works. We've done it all these years [Indigenous me dicine: Effectiveness].\" Indi genous medicine in this quote represented the major concept th at Elder 1 was discussing, and the subcode, or the subtopic related to the concept of Indigenous me dicine which Elder 1 discussed, was the \"effectiveness\" of Indigenous medicine. Once I completed an initial r ound of coding for the transcript, I re-read the transcript and reviewed each code that ha d been derived to ensure that 84 I had captured the essence of the participant's perspective and experien ce. All five interview transcripts were coded in this manner. The next step was to amalgamate and or ganize the descriptive codes into what Richmond (2002) referred to as a story map. A story map is a schematic picture of the overarching concepts discussed in the intervie w (horizontal axis), and a time orientation (vertical axis) with past, present, and future designations, that allow both the researcher and participant to holistically review the particip ant's shared story and implied meanings. The story map used in this study is a research anal ysis tool that has been adapted from Richmond (2002) that allowed participant narratives and stor ies to be retained and structurally organized in a way that allowed both the research part icipant and investigator to make sense and reconstruct participant e xperiences in a meaningful way and contextual way. Based on my literature review and interview questions, I anticipated that participant narratives could be organized unde r the four following structural headings: Self as Elder, Indigenous culture and medicine, Western medi cine, and integration. These headings were plotted onto the story map and placed across the top of the map along the horizontal axis and represented the structural cat egories of each participant's story. As Stewart (2007a) noted, individuals' stories and narrativ es become meaningful when th ey exist or evolve over time, and as such, the designations of past, present, a nd future were depicted along the vertical axis of the story map. Once the core story map had b een created (see Figure 1), the next step was to create a story map for each participan t by organizing and placing their respective descriptive codes into the map in line with th e structural headings and time orientations. Once the participant's initial story map was cr eated, I reviewed the participants' interview 85 transcripts and descriptive codes a final time , revising and refining their respective story maps to ensure a complete and organized map had been created. Figure 2: Core Story Map Self as Elder Indigenous Culture & MedicineWestern Medicine Integration (Ideas; forms; experiences with) Past Experiences Present Experiences Future Intentions The final step in Phase 2 of the resear ch process was to examine the story map holistically and identify any overarching core messages or themes that were saliently represented in the map. The core message represented the most prominent idea or concept discussed by the participant throughout their interview. A dditional significant ideas or concepts that were noted and discussed by the participants throughout their interviews were identified as themes. The story map, core me ssage and accompanying themes were presented to each interview participant Phas e 3 of the research process. Phase 3: In-depth interview #2 . In the second interview I presented each participant with a copy of their story map, core messa ge and themes, along with a copy of their transcript and audio-recording of their interview (if they wished). I verbally reviewed the story map with each participan t, explaining the descriptive co des, core message, and themes. Each participant had the opportunity to make co rrections or additions to their story map and further reflect on the interview questions. The following follow-up interview questions were used in discussing the story map, core message and themes: 86 1. From your narratives in your interview I have constructed a story map...how does this map illustrate your views? 2. What is missing from your story map? What would you like to add? 3. Do you have anything else to say about your story map? Upon completion of the second inte rview, I re-listened to the audio recording of the second interview and incorporated feedback and additional insights shared by the participants into their story maps. This process will be detailed for each participant in the results section in Chapter Four. Phase 4: Final analysis and writing . In the final analysis stage, I reviewed participant transcripts, story maps, and core messages and themes across one another to determine similarities and divergences of opinion with respect to the overarching research question informing this study. This final stage of analysis yielded six areas of discussion related to the notion of in tegrating Indigenous and West ern healing paradigms and approaches, which are detailed in Chapter Five of this thesis. This phase of analysis was completed in my writing the within participan t results, across participant results, and the concluding chapters of my thesis. Phase 5: Final results and dissemination . Upon completion of this thesis, the results of this study will be drafted into a research re port and provided to each interview participant. It is also my intention to discuss with each pa rticipant their perspectives on how the findings from this research study can be best used in servicing the larger Indigenous community. I also intend on disseminating the results of the study through scholar ly publications and presentations, and through reports that will be sent to various I ndigenous and non-Indigenous 87 agencies in the mental health sector. Prior to formal dissemination of the findings, I will receive approval from the five participants in this study. Summary of Chapter Three In Chapter Three I presented the methodologi cal approach that wa s employed in this study. The theoretical underpinnings and rationa le for the use of a qualitative research paradigm and narrative inquiry methodology were pr esented. I situated myse lf in the research process by examining how my own personal narra tive informs my approach to the research, and the development of my relationships with my participants. Fi nally, I reviewed the procedures and analysis phases of the research process, whic h included an overview of the participant recruitment process and participant sample, data co llection methods and analyses. I ended the chapter by outlining how the research findings will be disseminated and utilized in future projects. 88 Chapter Four: Within-Participant Results Chapter Four presents the individual pa rticipant results and within participant analysis. This comprises a brief character sket ch, a description of th e first interview and initial story map and corresponding core messa ge and themes, a brief discussion of the second interview, and the final story map, co re message and interview themes for each participant. The character sket ch outlines details related to the nature of my research relationship with each participant, the recr uitment process for each participant, and information related to the inte rview process that is unique to each participant. The core message represents the most prominent theme or idea from the participant's interview, and other dominant ideas from the interview are noted as themes. Participants are presented in the same order in which they were interviewed. It is also important to note that th e terms \"Indigenous medicine\" and \"Western medicine\" were used by most of the Elders in this study as a shorthand to describe Indigenous health and healing sy stems and Western health and treatment systems. The term \"medicine\" encapsulates elements of each health care system, including theories of medicine, healing or treatment approaches and interventi ons, and the respective practitioners of each type of health and healing approach. Additi onally, while the focus of this thesis is on examining how Western mental health appro aches may be integrated with Indigenous healing approaches, the Elders in this st udy discussed the physical/medical Western healthcare system in addition to the mental h ealthcare system. As was noted in the literature review, Indigenous conceptions of health are often holistic in na ture, and health is understood to be comprised of multiple dimensions of well-being (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual). It is for this reas on that the Elders in this study spoke about the various Western 89 healthcare systems that Indigenous peoples may access, and discussed how integrative efforts may be practiced at various leve ls of healthcare. And finally, while the Elders spoke broadly about the Western healthcare system, its trea tment methods and practitioners, oftentimes making generalizations about this system, each Elder also recognized that individual Western-trained practitioners pr actice healthcare differently and some have demonstrated a shift in attitude towards Indigenous health and healing systems. Participant One Character sketch . Participant One chose the identifier \"Elder 1\" as his preferred pseudonym. My research relationship with Elder 1 begin during the formative stages of my research project, as I often consulted and sought counsel fr om him while formulating my research question and design. Elder 1 was th erefore recruited through my long standing relationship with him, and was fairly familiar with the research topic at the outset of the formal research interview phase. Elder 1 al so provided recommendations for other Elders that he thought would be ideal candidates for the project. He a ttended our first interview as scheduled, and was available for a follow-up interview to review his story map and corresponding core message and themes. First interview. My first interview with Elder 1 was both exciting and thought- provoking. We held the interview in an office space that Elder 1 uses for his teaching and healing work, which created a calming and inspiring environment as many Indigenous medicines and objects were displayed throughout the office. Since Elder 1 had provided me with counsel throughout the research process, I knew of some of his experiences to date and looked forward to hearing about them in more detail. I began the interview by reviewing the informed consent form orally and in writing. On ce Elder 1 provided consent, I presented him 90 with a bundled gift of medicine (sage, sweet grass, cedar, and tobacco) and presented the (research) question I was seeking knowledge for. Elder 1 accepted my gift, thereby indicating that he felt he had knowledge he could share with me related to my topic. After reviewing the specific interview questions I had, we began th e audio recording and Elder 1 proceeded to answer each interview question thoroughly. Elde r 1's answers consisted of traditional teachings, cultural and personal stories, the sharing of personal opinions and experiences related to the subject, and th e use of humour. Our intervie w lasted 90 minutes in length. The initial story map was constructed during the analysis phase of this interview, as per the process explained in Chapter Three (s ee Figure 2). Upon completion of this initial story map see Figure 3), I identified a clear core message and three themes from the map and interview. The initial core message for Elde r 1 was Indigenous cu lture as foundation for health. The themes were: go where there is n eed, the effectiveness of Indigenous medicine, and the potential for Indigenous and Western ap proaches to complement one another. Feedback from second interview and final story map. Once I completed the analysis of my first interview with Elder 1, a nd constructed his story map and identified the corresponding core message and themes, I sche duled a second interview to review these findings with him. I began this interview my explaining the analys is procedure to him (breaking the interview data into smaller parts, coding for thematic content, and then reconstructing his narrative into a cohesive st ory map) and how I came to identify the core message and themes. In reviewing the story map, I presented Elder 1 with the following questions: \"From your narratives in your inte rview I have constructed a story map...how does this map illustrate your views? What is missing from your story map? What would you like to add? Do you have anything else to sa y about your story map?\" In response to these 91 Figure 3.

However, as I reviewed each segment of the story map with him, he added a few additional points to the various sections of his map. For instance, under the Indigenous Culture and Medicine heading for Present Experien ces, Elder 1 stated that many Elders today hold what could be considered a Master in Life Experience and Knowledge in Indigenous Ways. In the Future In tentions section, he al so added the need to create a registry of Elders and healers working throughout Turtle Island so that those working in more rural areas could be easily identified for referral purposes. Under the Western Medicine heading in the Present Experience section, he noted that the Western health system discounts spiritual knowledge and practice because it cannot quantifiably measure it, but that they do reach out to other health practitioners (e.g. Indigenous healers) when th ey recognize they can no longer help an individual heal. In terms of Future In tentions for Western Medicine, Elder 1 stated that the Western health system needs to r ecognize the equivalent amount of knowledge and skills that other practitioners and healers posse ss, and that relationships with Indigenous Elders and healers working in rural communitie s need to be strengthened. And finally, under the Integration heading in the Future Intentions section, Elder 1 stated that with respect to next steps towards integrated practice, Indi genous Elders' and healers' knowledge and skill sets must be recognized by the Western health system, a referral system between Western and Indigenous practitioners n eeds to be developed, and progra ms for Western practitioners that offer training in Indigenous ways (e.g. sp ending time with an Elder in the bush) should be implemented into educational programs. All of these changes have been noted in Figure 4 and are indicated by the underlined text. 93 Figure 4.

He commented that he was looking forward to the final results from the st udy, and shared with me that I must make bold and strong recommendations, as I am now the pen for the knowledge that the Elders have shared with me. Final core message and themes . The core message and themes did not change as a result of the second interview with Elder 1. The core message was Indigenous culture as foundation for health. The themes were: go wh ere there is need, th e effectiveness of Indigenous medicine, and the potential fo r Indigenous and Western approaches to complement one another. Indigenous culture as foundation for health . Elder 1 spoke all throughout the interview about the importance of Indigenous culture as a key determ inant of health and healing for Indigenous people. Indigenous cult ure was characterized by diverse number of things, including traditional know ledge, plant medicines, sing ing and drumming, spirituality, Elders, ceremony, story, and language: I do understand the (name of nation's) langua ge, so with that, that's traditional knowledge. It is traditional, it is the language that ma kes us, that gives us voice [...] I do know that when we offer our prayers and burn tobacco it brings everybody into a place of the sacredness of the spirituality of the fire, because ceremony is happening. And the drummers, or whichever group, they have a certain function, and they do theirs and the Elders speak, and we do ours, and we work together (E1 p.6). 95 When discussing health and how to ensure th e well-being of the upcoming generations of Indigenous peoples, Elder 1 discussed the importance of their gathering Indigenous knowledge and being covered in experiential stories. The shar ing of knowledge was viewed as a way to support and strengthen the next generation's identity and sense of self: The coming generations, like when we say there's the seven generations, everything that we do is supposed to be for them. To come, as they're coming, as their faces are coming out of th e ground, and as they become more knowledgeable, as they learn those things, they need to be covered with these experiential stories so that they can lear n, so that they can become who they are supposed to be. So that they can stand up in their right place and at their right time they will be level headed and th ey'll turn around and they become the healers (E1 p. 18). Similarly, when discussing strategies and pr actices for healing among Indigenous peoples, Elder 1 spoke about the importa nce of making Indigenous spiritu ality accessible to those who are seeking healing. He discussed the work of many Elders who have gone into the prison system to provide teachings and ceremony: And the other Elders that go to these pl aces, (name of Elder), they've all been there, (name of Elder), they 've all be in these places to bring the traditional ways, traditional Aboriginal spirituality into those places so we could [...] So those boys who, boys, who made a mist ake and did something wrong, and got caught, they can still have their spirituality. That's what our, that's what we do. Ceremony, again I would say ceremony (E1 p.17). 96 In Elder 1's opinion, the various elements of Indigenous culture, including traditional knowledge and ceremony, function as key underpi nnings to living well and healing from distress. Elder 1 often commented that Aboriginal peoples who are looking to heal need their ceremonies, and it is through ceremony that they can reconnect with th e original ways of their people: Traditional Aboriginal healing methodologies, I guess? Ceremonies? Ceremonies and stuff. We do ceremony. So if you hear me talking, when we do ceremony it is connecting us to creation again; it's connecting you back to creation. Connecting you back to the root s of your family. Opening your eyes and opening your mind and your ears so you can hear the music from way back (E1 p. 12-13). Elder 1 shared that one of his primary tasks as an Elder is to \"build sacred space\" for his people and prepare the upcoming generations of youth with teachings and knowledge about Indigenous culture. Go where there is need . A second theme evident from Elder 1's interview is his belief that part of an Elder's job is to provide support and as sistance wherever there is need. He shared how he personally practices this in stating, \"People ask me to come, and okay, I go. I don't ask why I'm going, don't ask for anyt hing, just go, because they've asked me. That to me is what the Elders do\" (E1 p.8). One implication of this belief is that Elders can be expected to work in both rural and ur ban environments, given that many Indigenous people live off-reserve and in urban centres. Elder 1 commented that while many Elders who work in rural settings still prefer to not travel into the city, there is an increasing number of Elders who are working in urban spaces: \"There are lots of Elders who are very 97 conservative, very knowledgeable, and they won' t leave the reserve...[but there's those] who are going out there and being with the people in the world, because if they're there, we need to be right there with them\" (E 1 p.19). Flexibility in working in urban centres suggests that a number of different venues will be accessed as gathering spaces, and in discussing his ability to speak his people's language, El der 1 shared how he is often i nvited to provide teachings in a variety of settings. He highlighted this by humourlessly citing concrete monuments: In the traditional ceremonies of the (nam e of people), people have asked me to stand up because I am a speaker, and w ill you speak for this now? That's why a lot of times I speak in (language), be cause I can speak in my own language. Yeah, I do. I have to, I build sacred space; whether that's the Longhouse or whether that's a tipi - th ere's different kinds of lodges - or log cabins, or concrete monuments [laughs]. Who am I th ere for and what is it that's required? (E1 p.8). It is these concrete monuments that most re semble mainstream health spaces, such as hospitals or prisons. For Elder 1, going and help ing wherever there is need also entails working in mainstream venues and institutions at times, and also providing services to individuals of different Nations than his own. In describing his work at a hospital with Indigenous peoples vis iting from another part of Tur tle Island, Elder 1 shared: One time people came down from (name of community) and (name of hospital in city) called me. They said we have th is family and they want Elders to come in and do things, will you come please? This is Western medicine, a hospital, calling me. So I go there, and I went ther e [...] And they were so touched, they 98 were so moved that I knew them, that I knew their territory. So I offered prayers\" (E1 p. 10). In this example, Elder 1 shar ed how his being able to wo rk in urban and mainstream locations greatly benefited those who were in need. Flexibility in working in diverse environments is clearly an important issu e when considering whether Indigenous and Western healing approaches can be integrat ed, and will be addressed in the upcoming chapter. Effectiveness of Indigenous medicine . All throughout his in terview Elder 1 spoke about the various types of Indigenous medici nes and healing methods that many Indigenous peoples access and practice. As has been noted earlier, Indige nous medicine is distinctly different than Western biomedical notions of medicine. Indigenous medicines can include things such as specific plants, healing objects, or spiritual practices, but also more broadly encapsulate human behaviours such as laugh ter or being kind (Garrett & Wilbur, 1999). Individual people, such as El ders and healers or family me mbers, can be identified as medicine, and the natural world (trees, plants, s un, wind) are often a source of medicine for people. When I returned for my second interview with Elder 1, he asked me to review the list of different medicines that he had spoken about during his first interview to ensure that he did not leave anything signifi cant out. The specific Indigenous medicines that Elder 1 identified included the use of story, Indi genous language, singing, drumming, feasting, prayer (of all faiths), making offerings and be ing thankful, ceremony and ceremonial objects (such as ritual purification a nd turtle rattles), and Elders and healers themselves. Elder 1 spoke about the effectiveness of these various types of medicine and how they have been 99 practiced since time immemorial in sta ting, \"When you're in the bush, you're doing Indigenous medicines. Go with it, go with it, it works. We've done it all these years\" (E1 p. 8). However, the underlying commonality betwee n all of these different forms of medicine and the key to their effectiveness is their strong connection with a higher spiritual being, which Elder 1 referred to as Cr eator. These various types of me dicine were understood to be tools for connecting an individual with the Crea tor, which is the primary source of healing and well-being: The best medicines come from our people. The other medicines, scientific stuff, is scientific. But our people, really ou r medicines, we get it through dream, dreams. The Creator comes and speaks to us. Actually, He just takes us to a place and brings us back to now so we can know that everything... And so I don't feel short changed anywhe re or by anybody else (E1 p.14). In discussing how Indigenous medicines are ofte n gifted to Indigenous people by the Creator, Elder 1 asserted his belief in the power and effectiveness of these medicines and also commented that he does not \"feel short chan ged\" when thinking of the other types of medicines or healing approaches that exist. For instance, in discussing some of the differences between Indigenous me dicine and the Western health system (referred to here as Western medicine), Elder 1 shared how Indigeno us medicine is often more effective than Western medicine, and Indigenous peoples are often referred back to their communities for healing when Western medicine is no longer proving effectual: They send sick people back and they as k for - at least the (name of) people - because they're the ones who believe in that way, and so they come in and they have a feast. They put on a feast and they feed the spirits, they feed the spirits 100 and they feed the soul. They feed the {inaudible} and in doing that some people are healed. Western medici ne can't do that. Western medicine can't do that. They can, it can be done, you just have to know how to do it (E1 p.12). In discussing the ceremony of feasting, spirit and ancestral relations are identified as facilitative aspects for healing, something whic h Elder 1 indicated is lacking in much of Western healthcare treatment services. It is important to note that he does not believe the Western healthcare system is incapable of provi ding spiritual care to their clients, but this vital element of healing for many Indigenous people is currently absent from much of mainstream treatment. Potential for Indigenous and Western approaches to complement one another . Elder 1 was of the opinion that Indigenous and Western approach es to health and healing can potentially complement one another. He commented that both I ndigenous and Western medicine have limits in terms of the type of healing or treatment they can provide: \"Sometimes there's some things we can't, our medicines don't work, so they have Western medicine coming in and helping. That's good too. So we don't turn down medicine; medicine is medicine\" (E1 p.8). While Elder 1, an Indigeno us healer himself, was open to the idea of using each type of approach to address healing needs, he noted that the Western healthcare system tends to have more difficulties with Indigenous medicine and are more reluctant to collaborate, \"Western medicine generally has tr ouble dealing with Aboriginal medicine\" (E1 p.9). Nonetheless, some of Elder 1's experiences with the Western healthcare system to date have included receiving referrals from Wester n practitioners when they could no longer provide adequate treatment, \"There's times wh en Western says we can't do anymore. They need to be ministered to or use the medicines, and that's what I've done, that's my job\" (E1 101 p.10). Elder 1 also identified challenges to the integration of Indigenous and Western approaches, which will be discussed in more detail later, but believed in the potential for each method to complement one another. Participant Two Character sketch . Participant Two chose the identifier \"Witness 2\" as her preferred pseudonym. While Witness 2 is recognized as an Elder and Traditional Teacher by the Indigenous community of Toronto, and as a K nowledge Keeper by her own people, she felt that the term Witness most accurately de scribed her knowledge and experiences with Western and Indigenous paradigms of health. My research relationship with Witness 2 began during the formal stages of participant recr uitment for the study. In seeking participant recommendations from my community informan ts, Witness 2 was identified as a knowledge keeper with experience in working in both Indigenous and Western health and healing settings. Prior to my formal invitation to par ticipate in the study, I me t with Witness 2 on two separate occasions to discuss my research topi c. Witness 2 shared a great deal of knowledge with me during these informal meetings, and when I inquired if she w ould be interested in formally participating, she said she would be willing to sit for an interview. While both the initial and follow-up interviews had to be resc heduled due to various circumstances, Witness 2 and I were successful in holding an initial and follow-up interview. First interview. My first interview with Witness 2 was marked by an air of eagerness and anticipation, as we had rescheduled several times. We held the interview in an office space that Witness 2 was familiar with. I began the interview by reviewing the informed consent form orally and in writing. Once Witne ss 2 provided consent, I presented her with a bundled gift of medicine (sage, sweetgrass, cedar, and tobacco) and pr esented the (research) 102 question I was seeking knowledge for. While Witn ess 2 agreed to partic ipate in the study, she shared that these medicines are not generally us ed by her people, and that a gift of a blanket would have been more appropriate. I shared w ith Witness 2 that I wa s visiting an Indigenous women's organization that she had worked with in the past, and offered to present these medicines to this organization on her behalf as thanks for her participation in the study. Witness 2 agreed with the suggestion and we proceeded to review my interview questions together. Before turning on the audio recorder, W itness 2 asked that we first discuss the idea of whether Indigenous and Wester n approaches can be practiced together before turning to anything else. We were interru pted twice by incoming telephone calls during the first half hour of the interview, but Witness 2 had no diffi culty in resuming where she had left off prior to the interruption. Witness 2's answers consisted of cultural and personal st ories, the use of symbolism and analogy, humour, and personal op inions and experiences related to the subject. Our interview last ed 140 minutes in length. The initial story map (see Figure 5) was cons tructed during the analysis phase of this interview and upon completion of this initial ma p, I identified a clear core message and two themes from the map and interview. The initia l core message for Witness 2 was aggregating, consolidating, and disseminating Indigenous kn owledge. The themes were: holistic health; weaknesses in the Western health system; and integration is occurring too soon. Feedback from second interview and final story map . Once I completed the analysis of my first interview with Witness 2, and constructed her story map and identified the corresponding core message and themes, I sc heduled a second interview to review these findings with her. Having remembered Witn ess 2's comments rega rding the gift I had presented her with, I located a blanket from her territory between interview one and two, 103 Figure 5.

Witness 2 accepted the blanket and expressed great thanks for my gift. I then presente d Witness 2 with her story map and shared how I had come to identify the core message and themes. In reviewing the story map, I asked Witness 2 the following questions : \"From your narratives in your interview I have constructed a story map...how does this ma p illustrate your views? What is missing from your story map? What would you like to ad d? Do you have anything else to say about your story map?\" Under the Indigenous Medicine heading in the Past Experiences section, Witness 2 added that appropria tion of Indigenous medicine by a number of different peoples and cultures has occurred. Unde r the Western Medicine heading in the Present Experiences section, Witness 2 changed \"lack of focus on pr evention methods for health issues\" to the absence of a holistic understanding of health and the interrelationships between these dimensions (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual). Witne ss 2 also pointed out that the emphasis should not be on how to prevent illnes s, but how to live well, and if illness does develop, examining its etiology in line with the different dimensions of well-being. Witness 2 also added that Western mental health workers conceptualize individuals through frameworks and narrowed theories instead of holistically and in their social and physical contexts. In the Future Intensions section of Western Medicine, Witness 2 stated that a rigorous inquiry into Western psychology' s theories and science is required. Under the Integration heading in the Past Experiences se ction, Witness 2 commented that the point \"integration is occurring too soon\" was too simplistic. She changed this point to state that integration is occurring prior to th e reclamation of Indigenous knowledge. She also asked that all the references to \"aggrega ting Indigenous knowledge\" be changed to \"re- aggregating Indigenous knowledge,\" as the term aggregate implies that Indigenous 105 knowledge is now just being consolidated, as op posed to recognizing that colonial processes forcefully fractured it. And lastly, in the Fu ture Intentions section, Witness 2 added that health systems should be focusing on the integra tion of knowledge and health practices of all peoples worldwide, not just I ndigenous and Western paradigms. Two changes were made to the core message and themes from Witness 2's interview. First, the core message was changed to re-aggregating, c onsolidating and disseminati ng Indigenous knowledge (as opposed to aggregating), and the third theme was changed from \"integration occurring too soon\" to integration occurring prior to reclamation of Indi genous knowledge. Witness 2 said that the remainder of the story map accurately captured the salient points from her interview. All of the above noted change s have been made in Figure 6 and are indicated by the underlined text. Final core message and themes. The final core message for Witness two was re- aggregating, consolidating a nd disseminating Indigenous knowledge. The final themes are: holistic health; weaknesses in the Western heal th system; and integration occurring prior to reclamation of Indigenous knowledge. Re-aggregating, consolidating and disseminating Indigenous knowledge . Indigenous knowledge was something that Witness 2 spoke about all throughout her interview, and was an underlying thread that ran throughout most of he r points of discussion. Witness 2 began the interview by discussing how various historical a nd colonial processes (epidemics, residential school , outlawing of Indigenous ceremony, etcetera) have impacted Indigenous knowledge as a whole, and the struct ure of the transmission systems specifically, that were in place prior to European contact: 106 Figure 6: Final Story Map: Witness 2 Self as Elder / KK Indigenous Medicine Western Medicine Integration (Idea;

The th ird thing that happened at the same time was the banning of the Potlatch or what they called the Potlatch Laws, which meant that we couldn't practice our healing modalities. So that destruction of our transmission systems, the destruction of the structures in our communities, the d eath of knowledge keepers, all led to a tremendous disconnect of all know ledge amongst our people (W2 p.1). These politically legislated attacks on I ndigenous knowledge led to alterations in the traditional knowledge transmission systems that were usually practiced between Elders/knowledge keepers/family and youth. These alternations have resulted in fractured sets of knowledge among many Indigenous people today: No one child was given the whole, and th ey were given the skeletons. I mean it totally made sense under the conditions of siege and illegalization. Each child was burdened with a bit a nd a skeleton, and then the hope was that they would get together at some point with othe r children and aggregate this knowledge and resynthesize it and then work to flus h it out. The problem with the plan is that each child didn't know w ho the other child was (W2 p.1). As was discussed in the review of the literature, Indigenous culture, community, and identity, have been identified as key determinants of health and well-being for Indigenous people today. As such, the disconnection betw een many Indigenous peoples and their 109 culture/knowledge has been iden tified as a contributing factor for elevated rates of both physical and mental health pr oblems today. Witness 2 gave several examples of gaps or disconnections with traditi onal knowledge, which included kn owledge related to sacred medicines, healing and ceremonial practices, and traditional diet: How many generations does it take to co mpletely alter your diet? Well more than four, more than four. Doctors know that, and that's what's happened to us. They killed the buffalo, they destroye d our camas, they killed the cod, they're killing the salmon, and so on and so fort h. And we don't have alternatives in their world. All our sea vegetables are gone and there's no alternatives, except maybe asparagus, it's about as close to an alternative that we have. So we're kind of screwed either way. And we have to be able to get our knowledge back so that we can look at and solve thes e problems. They're medical problems, yeah? Instead, they're sayi ng, well you have diabetes take this insulin. No, that's not the problem. Type II Diabet es, the kind we have, is completely solvable. No, they get better drugs (W2 p.11). In speaking about rates of diabetes among I ndigenous peoples, Witness 2 identified the absence of traditional diet as a source for th e development of health problems as well as a potential solution. It is for this reason that sh e believes concerted efforts need to be focused on re-aggregating, consolidating, and di sseminating Indigenous knowledge today. One of the challenges to re-aggrega ting Indigenous knowledge that Witness 2 identified as occurring in the past is that In digenous people have not had an opportunity or a venue to gather and discuss their knowledge: 110 So you know, in the context of pushing back on colonization, we were never afforded another venue, an alternativ e venue, to the one that was destroyed. That's what we need before we can do anything. I can't be sure that what I know is what I know unless I can sit with other knowledge ke epers, and really sit down and aggregate what we know and put it to the test of time (W2 p.2). What is critical for Witness 2 is being able to share, compare, and confirm the individual knowledge pieces that each knowledge keeper , Elder, or healer possesses, thereby strengthening Indigenous knowledge systems as a science and as a whole. Once the gathering of knowledge keepers has occurred, the next st ep in this process is to disseminate the knowledge to Indigenous communities and people so that they are empowered and informed about how health and healing issues have bee n, and continue to be, addressed within an Indigenous framework: We first have to aggregate the knowledge but then we have to disseminate it as well. We have to figure out a way to transmit it so that the communities have their own knowledge about how we dea lt with health before there was a medical health system, before there wa s a European medical health system. What did we do before? So we need to get that in place and then we need to disseminate it (W2 p.21). One method for dissemination which Witness 2 id entified is formalized education and the development of curriculum for Indigenous knowledge. She discussed how the knowledge transmission systems of the past may no longe r be an ideal format for sharing knowledge, given the structural changes in community and fa mily units that have occurred as a result of colonization, especially if the goal is widespread education: 111 It has to be in a formal way. It has to be organized and formal. Absolutely. We don't have time to bugger around and follow - I mean this is what they're doing now. You go and be a helper to an Elder and learn as much as you can. Well that worked 200 years ago when you had a community that basically knew what was going on and had access to all that knowledg e everyday, all the time. Well we don't have that now; we ha ve to create that. And the only venue we have is schools, that's it. So it has to be formal (W2 p.10-11). Through programmatic organiza tion, Indigenous knowledge woul d be disseminated in a streamlined and expedient fashion, with the hope that overall health a nd well-being would be improved and strengthened. However, one might expect that various challenges and issues may arise with such an endeavour, such as the content to be conve yed, given the diverse number of Indigenous peoples in Canada (e.g. Ojibway, Cr ee, Iroquois, M\u00e9tis, Inuit). Nonetheless, Canada has seen the developmen t of some Indigenous specific curriculum and programming (e.g. Aboriginal Head Start; In digenous Studies programming in universities), and additional formalized educational program s would assuredly be an asset to current educational efforts. In summary, the r eclamation of Indigenous knowledge and its dissemination to Indigenous peoples was identi fied as a key area of action by Witness 2, and also represented the first step in any moveme nt towards the integration of Indigenous and Western health and healing paradigms: I always put the emphasis on reclaimi ng our knowledge a nd figuring out how to disseminate it. Because the othe r thing, the acquisition of Western knowledge is happening; it happened to me, it happened to you, all kinds of us, thousands of us have Western knowle dge, thousands and thousands. So our 112 push should be for acquiring Indigenous knowledge and elevating it, constantly elevating it by, and I don't mean elevati ng it in the sense of holding it up higher than Western knowledge, but at least equal to. And then augmenting it, increasing it, always increasing it (W2 p.29). Holistic health . Witness 2 spoke about an Indigenous understanding of health and wellness as being comprised of four dimensions of self: emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical. Each one of the dimensions of well- being is of equal importance in maintaining health, as well as the interrelationship between them. For instance, in speaking about how individuals process traumatic experiences, Witness 2 explai ned how a weakened physical body complicates the psychological processing of trauma: There's no separation between physical a nd mental health. If you got a strong body then you will be able to withstand whatever traumas come your way. Your body gets scared if it's not in op timum shape. So then you experience trauma and you add a frightened body and that's when you get unresolved trauma (W2 p.17). Additionally, Witness 2 shared th at an Indigenous understanding of health tends to focus on how to live well and maintain health, as opposed to being cen tered on and addressing only illness as it develops. She provided an example of this in discussing how to nurture the four aspects of self in everyday life, \"Little things you know, the li ttle things we can control [...] to download those stressful feelings is very ve ry important. And to upload more vitamins and more positive food, you know the right kind of f ood [...] We're mentally ready for it, we're emotionally ready for it, we're f ood wise ready for it\" (W2 p.26). 113 This holistic understanding of h ealth also impacts how health problems are conceptualized, and the healing methods that are selected to a ddress the health issue. Instead of examining just the symptomatology of a problem and then treating it, an Indigenous health perspective entails examining the etiological factors of the health problem in line with the four dimensions of the self, and the interactions that occurred be tween these dimensions. Witness 2 referred to this proces s as re-tracking back: Re-track back. Say someone has diabetes , we track back what happened and we connect what happened with you emo tionally, and psychologically, and spiritually, with your dige stive system. We connect those two things right away. Well obviously if you're emotiona lly upset you're not digesting your food, so you're creating a toxic waste dump in one third of your body and it's spilling into all of your organs, making them all go crazy, overwork and shut down. So go ahead and take those shot s because you need them right now, but we're going to undo this. And there' s communities, I think (name of community) is a good example, who are working with traditional diet and diabetes, and of course winning the war (W2 p.6). Using the example of diabetes, Witness 2 highl ighted how emphasis is placed on exploring the contextual factors that were present at th e time of onset of the h ealth problem. Witness 2 juxtaposed the method of re-tracking back with a standard form of treatment for diabetes today, which is insulin therapy. As opposed to treating the diabetes through management of the problem, Witness 2 identified traditional diet as an intervention to \"undo\" the diabetes. The emphasis with this approach is to holisti cally examine the development of the health problem and identify strategies to correct the initial imbalance in the individual. 114 Weakness in the Western health system . Witness 2 identified weaknesses in both the physical/medical and mental hea lth sectors of the We stern healthcare system. One perceived weakness that was evident in bot h the physical and mental health sectors was the absence of a holistic understanding of health. Instead of examining th e root cause of health problems and addressing these factors, \"what Western medici ne is is quarantine, is olate, and repair and remove\" (W2 p.16). While the diagnostic system in the physical health sector was identified as a strength in healthcare, current treatment interventions were perceived as hazardous to one's health, \"Now I understand that they diagno se things much quicker than we do [...] The diagnosis is a powerful strength. They get it so fast. But the treatment is so harmful\" (W2 p.15). Witness 2 expressed grave concerns re lated to the use and even over-reliance on medication as a primary form of treatment and intervention in the Western healthcare system: We got a pill for that. Take another pill. And they're trying to get pills for everything and you end up with a pill that has all these side effects, so you got to take another pill and another pill (W2 p.15-16). The issue of medicating individual s was also raised in relation to the treatment of mental health disorders. Witness 2 expressed several cr iticisms of the theory and practice of Western psychology, including a lack of empirical eviden ce for classifications of mental health disorders, the use of medication to trea t mental health issu es, and its narrowed conceptualizations of psychological phenomena. In reflecting on a recent interaction with a panel of Western mental health professionals, Wi tness 2 elaborated on some of her beliefs in stating: I know we did a discussion in (name of city) with a number of psychologists and psychiatrists, and you know we eventu ally had to tell them that there is no 115 scientific proof for any of your theo ries. Don't call our stuff voodoo, because this guy says, 'Well it sounds like vo odoo.' You know? The way you're saying voodoo sounds like voodoo is a bad thing, fi rst of all. What's wrong with voodoo? And what you're doing is no differe nt. It's no different; it's all theory. Like they can't scientifically test you for bipolar disorder, but they're treating you with drugs for it. What the hell is th at? Now who tells us what's acceptable behaviour and what's not? (W2 p.9). Witness 2 expressed a desire for a rigorous inqui ry into the theory and practice of Western psychology and stated that differences in theo ry and knowledge systems, conceptualizations of health, and approaches to healing and treatmen t, are all issues that need to be addressed prior to the practice of integrated Indigenous and We stern healthcare. Integration prior to the reclam ation of Indigenous knowledge . Witness 2 expressed at different points throughout he r interview that she believes there is some potential for a relationship to develop between Indigenous and Western approaches to health and healing. However, in discussing current programming whic h has integrated the two systems, Witness 2 stated that she believes bot h Indigenous and Western prof essionals have rushed into practicing integratively. Prior to collaborat ion, Indigenous peoples and communities, and particularly the Elders and h ealers, must re-aggregate a nd consolidate th eir knowledge. Witness 2 explained why the reclamation of I ndigenous knowledge must first occur by using the analogy of full and emptied baskets: We have an almost empty basket becaus e we're disconnected from our original knowledge. And they have it in their ha nds, bowdlerized and transformed into useless information as far as we're con cerned. But their basket is full, so it's 116 going to sit on top of our empty basket and we're going to be the savage younger brothers or the savage younger si sters with the less knowledge. So they're going to call the shots, they're going to determine what's the scientific requirements (W2 p.14). For Witness 2, the Indigenous knowledge basket ha s been emptied as a result of colonization, whereas the Western knowledge bask et is full, as the last seve ral hundreds of years have been dominated by European rule and thought. Accord ing to Witness 2, it is important for both the Indigenous and Western entities to be equally equipped with know ledge bases to ensure that collaboration is truly egalitarian in design, and that a particular system does not wield more authority or power than the other, \"That's what they want to do now, by jumping the gun. The first people in line are going to be those with degrees recognized by Europeans, not our people. So I'm not in a hurry to do a ny of this sort of thing\" (W2 p.5). Witness 2 shared with me that even t hough some collaboration and integration has taken place, it is our responsibility to remind indi viduals that a great deal of work must still occur before moving forward, \"It's also important for people like us to be aware that there's a lot, a lot, a lot of work to do before we can start talking about bringing the two knowledges together, because we don't have all our knowledge\" (W2 p.11). Participant Three Character sketch . Participant Three chose the identifier \"Elder 3\" as her preferred pseudonym. I was familiar with Elder 3 from some of the community events she had attended and provided teachings at. I ther efore already had a pre-establis hed relationship with Elder 3, and she was familiar with me when I approach ed her during the formal recruitment phase about participating in my study. During an in itial meeting with El der 3 to discuss the 117 possibility of her participation, she shared her willingness to partic ipate because of the importance of the research topic at this time in our history. She invited me to a residence one weekend to conduct our initial inte rview, and we were also able to hold a follow-up interview to review her story map, core message and themes. First interview . Elder 3 and I began our interview by reviewing the informed consent form orally and in writing. Once Elder 3 provi ded consent, I presente d her with a bundled gift of medicine (sage, sweetgrass, cedar, and tobacco) and presented the (research) question I was seeking knowledge for. Elder 3 accepted th is gift and expressed her eagerness to discuss the issue of Indigenous healing. She re trieved some of the tobacco from the pouch I presented to her and laid some to the ground, o ffering a prayer of tha nks to the Creator and asking that our interview be conducted in a good way. We reviewed my specific interview questions together orally before turning on the audio recorder. This initial interview lasted 60 minutes in length, and Elder 3 spent the majority of the time sharing tr aditional teachings and explaining the importance of Indigenous knowledge with respect to health and healing. Since my first interview with Elder 3 was held outdoo rs at a home, Elder 3 provided a number of concrete examples when answering her quest ions, as she could draw on her environment around her (e.g. by discussing our re lationship with the natural world as part of healthy living). Once we reached the 60 minute mark, Elder 3 requested that we stop the interview as she was beginning to fatigue. She said that sh e would like to hold a second interview to answer my remaining interview questions. She al so said that she woul d like to receive some guidance from her personal teachers before di scussing the idea of Indigenous and Western integration. 118 The initial story map (see Figure 7) was c onstructed during the analysis phase of the initial interview. Since Elder 3 did not answer all the interview questions, there are a number of gaps in this first map. I was able to iden tify a core message and one theme from this interview: Indigenous epistemology (core messa ge) and the effectiven ess of Indigenous medicine (theme one). I presented this initia l map, core message, and theme to Elder 3 during our second interview for her to review. Feedback from second interview and final story map . Elder 3 and I met for our second interview in an office space that she was familiar with. I provided a summary of the things we had discussed during our first interview and the remaining questions that I had. I also presented Elder 3 with the initial story map I had constructed and the corresponding core message and theme. Under the Self as Elder heading, in the Presen t Experiences section, Elder 3 added that she currently works as a healer, providing doctorings and teachings to those who request her services. She also continue s to practice her belief system and live in a good way (i.e. in accordance with her beliefs and t eachings). In the Future Intentions section, Elder 3 shared that part of her ongoing work is to decolonize the belief systems of many Indigenous peoples who are wary or critical of Indigenous healing methods. However, she said that she does not force Indigenous wa ys upon anyone, and respects people's individual choices for the type of hea ling and healthcare system they wish to access. Under the Indigenous Medicine heading, in the Past Experiences section, Elder 3 added that Indigenous people have become disconnected from their knowl edge as a result of colonization, and that protocols have been established for working with healers and must be followed if the healing work is to be fruitful. In the Present E xperiences section, Elder 3 shared that many Indigenous people continue to be sceptical of In digenous medicine, but a lot of work is being 119 Figure 7.

The vast majority of my second intervie w with Elder 3 focused on discussing the Western healthcare system and the notion of in tegration. Several points were added to both the Western Medicine and Integration headi ngs and have been noted in Figure 8 by the underlined text. Elder 3 agreed with the core message and initial them e that were derived from her first interview and stated that they s hould remain as part of her final analysis. Two additional themes were identifie d upon analysis of my second interview with Elder 3, and were confirmed with her over the phone shortly afte r our second interview. Final core message and themes . The final core message for Elder 3 is Indigenous epistemology. The themes are the effectiv eness of Indigenous medicine, lack of understanding/respect for Indigenous ways, a nd challenges to integration. While the core message and first theme remained the same from my initial interview with Elder 3, the final two themes emerged after our second interview. Indigenous epistemology . The core element of Elder 3's interview was sharing Indigenous ways of knowing and her understa nding of the world, or an Indigenous epistemology. For instance, Elder 3 shared her be lief that all human beings are placed on the earth for a spiritual journey, a nd that gifts or a medicine bun dle (a collective of skills, teachings, individuals, etcetera, that each pers on possesses) are bestowed to each individual by the Creator for growth and spiritual development: What are you going to be doing in here, the purpose of your walk here, and then your spiritual tools, the kind of tools you're going to be using - sweatlodge, or pipe, tobacco, you know all of these things, tobacco, all of these 121 Figure 8.

You're here to experience some thing with life. And so you have your spiritual teachings [...] all of these t eachings, they are all in your medicine bundle (E3 p.4). According to this belief, each individual is des tined to have experienti al moments of learning in which the gifts they have received, and the knowledge they have accumulated, are strengths for overcoming challenges and learning . Some of the traditional teachings that Elder 3 shared included the cr eation story of her people, how a person's gifts or medicine bundle is received and assembled, and the purpose of certain Indigenous ceremonies, such as the sweatlodge. Elder 3 stressed throughout her interview that receiving and being familiar with Indigenous knowledge and teachings are vital to living life in a good way, and stated that individuals who are in sear ch of knowledge or answers need to return to the original teachings, as the solutions will be found there, \"So you have to go back. In order for you to learn everything you can [...] you have to go back to the teachings, you have to go back to the teachings. And that's where you learn ev erything, that's where you learn everything, because everything is in that teaching (E3 p.3). For Elder 3, an explicit connection exists between Indigenous ways of knowing and health and healing. Similar to he r instructions to return to or iginal knowledge when searching for answers, individuals must return to traditio nal teachings for their healing needs as well: So before anybody goes into the healing th ey have to know the origin of the creation story. All creation stories in th e world, and all creation stories are, they're all the same, they're all true. Because if y ou don't know the history, if 123 you don't know the origin, how can you explain, if somebody comes to you, how can you explain about your healing, the healing aspect of it? (E3 p.3). According to Elder 3, her worldview and pers pective as an Indigenous Elder and healer requires that she practices and shares the original knowledge of her people. Elder 3's particular belief system places great emphasis on spiritual knowledge and practice, which as she described, is foundational to achieving hea lth and living well. In digenous knowledge is understood as an incredible strength, and also ac ts as a method of healing for the individuals that she works with. Effectiveness of Indigenous medicine . A key theme for Elder 3 was the power and effectiveness of Indigenous medicine. She assert ed that medicines or healing practices exist for virtually all problems, \"And th ere's medicines used and all ki nds of stuff for all that. If you're having problems, there's medicines we us e\" (E3 p.6), and that they can be found in a diverse number of forms and practices, \"And I see others, what they do. They express themselves through, the healing is through danc ing, and arts, and all that. Music, drumming, or guitar, any kind of expression of the spirit\" (E3 p.8). However, as Elder 3 noted here, it is not the practices in and of themselves that are effective, it is the belief in the power of the spirit, or Creator, which facilitates healing. Sh e identified all of the tools that are used for healing today as being gifts from Creator that assist individua ls in communicating with the spiritual realm, and highlighted how she has pers onally been healed as a result of her strong faith and belief in this system: The Creator gave us everything, every ev ery thing for any kind of illness that we have, there's a cure for it, there's a cure for everything. We have cures for AIDS, we have cures for cancer, yo u know? Everything. Look at my cancers, 124 they were all cured. I should have died th ey said, they said in 10 days time. But my belief system is so strong. This is th e spirit. I know spirit can heal, can heal us. I have seen loved ones get healed. Bu t then we have to be schooled on how to do that (E3 p.9). Elder 3's reference to \"bei ng schooled\" on how to effectively work with Indigenous medicine also forms the basis of one of her primary critiques of the Western healthcare system, which is the absence of spiritual knowle dge and healing in trea tment, and a lack of understanding of how Indige nous healing is practiced. Lack of understanding/respect for Indigenous ways . Elder 3 discussed at various points throughout her interview some of the differences between Indigenous and Western approaches to health and healing. One of th e principle differences she discussed was the absence of a holistic understanding of health a nd the importance that re lationship with other entities (e.g. animals, the natural world, the sp irit world) play in maintaining health. As discussed above, spirituality is a key compone nt to well-being, and Elder 3 associated effective healing with relations hips with the spirit world. The absence of spiritual knowledge and healing in the Western healthcare system is perceived as a lack of understanding, even disrespect for, Indigenous approaches to health: So when you look at the dominant culture , what does the dominant culture say? They'll say well, you know the earth, oh we don't want the dirt. Nothing has spirit, nothing has spirit. So if they don't believe that there's nothing in this spirit, they're just going to cut down everything. They 're not going to offer the tobacco, they're not going to offer tha nks, they're not going to respect that, 125 respect that, those berries, or the medi cines, you know. Anything that grows out there has a special purpose (E3 p.9). Another example of disrespectful practice by th e Western healthcare system which Elder 3 discussed is current policies which prohibit th e use of certain medicines and ceremonies in mainstream settings (e.g. hosp itals, prisons). One of the most commonly discussed examples by all of the Elders in the study was a ritu al purification ceremony, more commonly referred to as smudging, in which sacred medicines (most commonly sage, cedar, sweetgrass, or tobacco) are burned with the intention of cleansing and purifying a person, object, or physical space. In inquiring about whether she ever work s as a healer in mainstream spaces, Elder 3 commented: I will choose not too because they d on't believe in purifying, they don't understand or they don't want to unders tand our way of life. And it's respect eh? [...] Before you heal, you have to ope n up that person and heal that person, detoxify that person, and people don't unde rstand that. What is smudging? It's detoxifying that person before the spir it, you don't want to invite a healing spirit to come in, because they travel from long ways to come and heal you, and then it's in a dirty place (E3b p.3). It is clear that Elder 3's expe riences to date of working w ithin the mainstream healthcare setting have been marked by an air of disr egard for Indigenous knowledge and practices. This lack of understanding and outright refusa l to accommodate Indigenous healing practices has been understood as a form of disrespect by many Indigenous Elders and healers, and is one of the many issues which Elder 3 identified as an obstacle to practicing collaboratively with Western healthcare professionals. 126 Challenges to integration . When asked about her perspectives and experiences with working integratively with the Western healthcar e system, Elder 3 shared that she tends to not work in these settings for a variety of diffe rent reasons. As was not ed above, the lack of spiritual practice and understanding about the importance of spirituality for many Indigenous people is one obstacle to collaboration for Elder 3: I will just not go there and say hey, I'll work for this non-native organization and use our way, I'm just wasting my time because I kn ow the spirit is not there. If the spirit was there, if they believed in the spirit , I would, but they don't want to, they don't want to (E3b p.2). It is important to note that El der 3 is not completely opposed to integrated practice as she highlighted that she would be willing to work in mainstream spaces if spiritual healing was recognized as significant to healing processes. Another challenge identified by Elder 3 ar e differences in training standards for Indigenous healers and Western practitioners. Many Indigenous epistemologies contain the belief that each individual is best owed with gifts and skills that are unique, such as the gift of singing, or story-telling, or h ealing. Sometimes these gifts ar e received at a young age, as Elder 3 noted, \"So they have that gift, they have their gifts. Maybe you learned it when you were young, maybe somebody passed it onto you, but it 's a gift. Some people are gifted, they have that gift of healing, a nd others, the mind, and herbs\" (E 3 p.11). Individuals often spend the remainder of their life developing and prac ticing the gift, often working and training with other Indigenous healers for years. However, this form of training is distinctly different than the Western education system, which only rec ognizes a specific type of knowledge with progress marked by diplomas or degrees. While so me Indigenous societies also have a degree 127 system which connotes levels of Indigenous knowledge and training, such as the Midewin Lodge Society, this type of trai ning and degree level is often not recognized or regarded as of the same calibre as Western education. Levels of training and education often become an area of challenge when the issue of remuneration of Elders and healers is raised, \"They don't respect that, they don't understa nd that, they don't want to, be cause they say oh well we have to pay these guys\" (E3b p.3). Both recognition of di verse forms of training and skill level, as well as compensation, are issues that currently stand as challenges to integration for Elder 3. A final challenge that Elder 3 identified wa s the nature and stru cture of the current programming and treatment services offere d in the Western healthcare system that Indigenous practitioners would be attempting to integrate wi th. Elder 3 shared that the majority of treatment programs offered toda y have been developed by administrators of treatment centres, as opposed to consulting wi th Indigenous Elders and healers, \"So what they have tried to do is create programs for us. We haven't created those programs, they have created those programs for us, st ill under the power and contro l. There is no equality in there\" (E3b p.2). Elder 3 also discussed how funding tends to impact the content of a program, which she also believes explains why Indigenous spiritual ity is absent from a great deal of programming, \"It's all government funded. The programs, they're programmed by the government. It hasn't been done spiritually. Th at's really really th e sad part of it\" (E3b p.5). Moving forward, Elder 3 stated that if in tegrated practice were to occur, programming would have to be developed equitably and in line with Indigenous ways. One example that she provided was of a drug and alcohol treatment program: Go somewhere for long healing, not just 28 days, not just a two week thing where they can go to a healing centre [... ] It took a long time for that person, 128 say an alcoholic, it takes seven years for that alcoholic to detoxify themselves, take that medicine out. So it takes a long long, it's a long process [...] because you have to go through the cycle, you have to go thr ough the seasons, the stages of life, you got to go through that (E3b p.4). It is clear from Elder 3's commen ts that there are still many ch allenges and issues that must be addressed prior to considering full-sca le integration of I ndigenous and Western approaches. Participant Four Character sketch . Participant Four chose the identifier \"Traditional Teacher 4\" (TT4) as his preferred pseudonym. A community informant suggested that I contact TT4 to inquire if he might be interested in particip ating in the study. I had had met TT4 several years prior to my academic studies through my i nvolvement with the Toronto urban Indigenous community, but had not had any contact with TT 4 since then. I emailed TT4 sharing that he had been recommended to me by a community in formant, and provided a brief description of my research topic and asked that he re-contact me if he had a ny interest in participating. TT4 responded and expressed interest in sitting for an interview, and we scheduled our first interview shortly thereafter. While TT4 and I were able to hold an initial interview, we did not hold a second interview. However, his story map and corresponding core message and themes were sent to him over email for his review. First interview . I looked forward to my interview with TT4 as it had been many years since I had spoken with him last. Before conducting our interview, TT4 and I had lunch together and chatted about our personal lives. After visiting, we travelled to a community centre and used a group room to conduct our inte rview in. I began the interview by reviewing 129 the informed consent form orally and in writing. Once TT4 provided consent, I presented him with a bundled gift of medicine (sage, sweet grass, cedar, and tobacco) and presented the (research) question I was seeking knowledge for. TT4 accepted this gift and shared that he would try and answer all the questions to the best of his abil ity. He also informed me that he would be citing the names of the mentors and teachers that he has received many of his teachings from, and that much of his knowledge is shared knowledge that he has received from others. We reviewed my interview questions together orally before turning on the audio recorder. TT4 was very articulate and thorough in answering each of th e interview questions, using several traditional teachi ngs, personal and cultural stories, and sharing his perspectives and experiences related to the subject matter. Our interview lasted 120 minutes in length. The initial story map (see Figure 9) was c onstructed during the analysis phase of the initial interview, and a core message and th ree corresponding themes emerged from this interview. Since TT4 and I currently reside in different cities, we deci ded that the story map, core message, and themes should be emailed to TT4 for his review, and any feedback or revisions would be emailed back to me. At th is time I have not received any additional feedback from TT4 and the story map depicted in Figure 9 is considered the final version of his story map. Finale core message and themes . The final core message for TT4 is Indigenous culture as foundation for health. The three themes are: shift in Western attitudes; practices integratively, but issues remain; need for education. Indigenous culture as foundation for health . Traditional Teacher 4 described a number of different elements of Indigenous culture (plant medicines, ceremony, Elders, 130 Figure 9: Final Story Map: Traditional Teacher 4 Self as Elder / TT Indigenous Culture & Medicine Western Medicine Integration (Idea; Forms; Experiences with) Past Experiences o Organizational and political involvement o Keen to learn o Healing journey - remembering his song o Assembled Bundle (learned traditions; Elder's helper) o Role of Elders as Mentors (listened to stories; as healers) o Embarking on journey with partner o Participation in ceremony (sundance; fast; sweat) o Honoured Story-telling tradition o Recognition as Elder from community o Healing work (healing circle; ceremony; Elders) o Intellectual and intuitive-spirit logic systems o Indigenous medicines (Elders and their orality/story; ceremony; community; cultural identity) o Effectiveness of Indigenous medicine o Levels of healing: individual, family, community, clan, Nations, Mother Earth o Spiritual and pastoral care requires practice of ceremony (e.g. smudging) o Conducting ceremony in urban spaces o Aboriginal peoples disconnected from traditional knowledge and practices o Attempt to prevent use of Indigenous healing practices (e.g. smudging in hospital) o Disrespect healers and medicines o Have been refused the right to smudge in mainstream settings o Traditional people not treated with respect or recognition that they deserve [On the Idea] o Can work together - open to using both o Working in new land o Choice to access diverse systems must remain though [On the Rationale] o Walk in two worlds o Goal is to connect people with spirit o Spiritual Pastoral Care Present Experiences o Story-teller o Learning from contemporaries as well as Elders o Integrate traditional knowledge with contemporary events o Pride in culture and gifts of Aboriginal peoples o Strength from relationship with partner o Healing Work (perform ceremonies) o Indigenous knowledge a nd practices being legitimized by Western science o Aboriginal peoples disconnected from traditional knowledge and practices o Specializations of healers and Elders o Healers and Elders are being over-worked in some cases o Fail to show appropriate amount of respect for Elders/healers o Beginning to recognize validity and legitimacy of Indigenous knowledge and practices o Some shifting in attitudes o Western professionals still display resistance to use of medicines [How does it occur?] o Foundation is respectful relationship o West must recognize effectiveness of Indigenous ways o At request of Aboriginal peoples o Services requested by West o Does see shift in attitude toward Indigenous practices and beliefs o Storied example of The Great Law [Examples and Experiences of Integration] o Single session o Programmatic o Collaborate with professionals o Collaborate with organizations o Western professionals still display resistance to use of medicines o Structural and organi zational changes have resulted Future Intentions o Share teachings with coming generations and non-Indigenous peoples o Working and training youth in traditional ways o Indigenous peoples as leaders in healing the earth o Knowledge and medicines to be shared with others, if asked in a respectful and appropriate way o Will look to Aboriginal peoples for guidance around healing the earth and individual healing [Current challenges that need to be addressed] o Differences in logic and theory systems o Structural changes are needed to make allowances for spiritual practices o Budget costs o Remuneration for Elders and healers o Increase training and education related to Indigenous knowledge, medi cine, practices, and protocols for engaging with traditional people 131 story-telling, community, cultural identity, spir ituality) that provide a solid foundation for being well and healing. He shar ed numerous examples of how these different aspects of Indigenous culture have aided him personally in overcoming mental and physical health issues: I often tell the story that I am a member of the (name of) cl an, member of the (name of) nation, and I was this burdened man who had forgotten his song. And it was due to a lot of trauma, a lot of negative things that happened in my life, and I know that it all happened for a reas on and that I could heal from that. And through my culture, through the ceremony, through a lot of {inaudible} tears, through a lot of grief work, trauma ther apy, ceremonial infl ation of the ego, I started to, I started healing. I starte d to understand my humanity and I understood that Creator has some purpose for me . And I used to think I was garbage and then people said Creator didn' t create garbage, that's all in your mind. Creator created everything in the beau tiful image of Himself, Herself, so you have something in you that is of wort h that you have to find, because that's your contribution, that's your gift, that's your purpose (TT4 p.10). Here we see that Indigenous culture provided TT4 with a sense of purpose and anchors for an identity. TT4 also spoke about the importance of possessing a strong I ndigenous identity in elevating one's self-esteem and self-worth when discussing his reclamation of the spirit name he had received as a young man, \"Now I can do something with that name. And I'll make it a name that one of my descendants will be proud to want to carry and have that as their name, as their title. So ever since then I went thr ough a change, I began to change, and I started to, I started falling into the story- telling tradition\" (TT4 p.12). Th e power of story and the story- 132 telling tradition was something that TT4 di scussed throughout his interview, and in conjunction with that, Elders as mentor s and a type of Indigenous medicine. Traditional Teacher 4 refl ected on a number of different experiences of working and studying with several Elders throughout North America. He expressed thanks for their knowledge and role as emblems of Indigenous culture and spirituality, as they often represented the roots for growth that many I ndigenous peoples were searching for, \"So all these people stuck together to help our people because they knew that's what we, we were all searching for something about our identity and who we were, and I was so glad that they came into my life\" (TT4 p.8). TT4 also iden tified the sense of community, caring, and support, that the Elders conveyed and crea ted, which in and of itself was healing: Here is an Elder who took the time to ma ke me feel like th is is where I belong, I'm home here, and that now, if I surr ound myself with the right people, all these good people, and I take care of th em, they'll take care of me. And I'm part of community now, and that's how we heal (TT4 p.9). TT4 was very explicit in his be lief about the power and effect iveness of Indigenous healing methods, describing the role that ceremony and Elders have played in his personal healing journey: We started the day off with a sunrise, sometimes sweat, and I had never done that before. We get up at the break of dawn and go into the sweatlodge, it was fantastic. But I was home again, all of a sudden I didn't need to drink eh? That was the thing about it, I knew that this was special when I felt that I didn't need to drink and alter my moods. So I love d it. So spending time with (name of Elder) was really powerful medicine for me (TT4 p.4). 133 As has been discussed elsewhere, Indigenous cu lture, which is comprised of many different elements and is also unique in its formation for each individual, has been identified as an important aspect of healing for many Indige nous peoples, and also se rves as a protective factor for the development of health issues. In TT4's case, strong connections with his culture have assisted him in identifying a purpose in life, and an accompanying lifestyle which serves to balance and ma intain health and well-being. Shift in Western attitudes . Traditional Teacher 4 discussed how in the past, and even still today, Western institutions have prohibite d, or attempted to prohibit, the use of Indigenous healing practices, \"w e've all had stories about what we've had to go through wanting to try to smudge, and the bottom line is that we had to go outside, couldn't do it inside\" (TT4 p.25). However, TT4 believes that a shift in attitude and practice has begun to occur, discussing how many Western professi onal bodies have accommodated Indigenous individuals in their healing n eeds, and have also approached and invited Indigenous healers to perform ceremony or give teachings in thei r respective establishm ents. One example of this shift in attitude which TT4 has observed has been through his work with Chaplaincy groups, and at times, with the Western health care system. In describing a case where an Indigenous woman in a hospital requested to have a smudging performed, and was initially refused by the nursing staff, TT4 stated: Well the minister on the reserve went in to the hospital and said no, she doesn't have to go outside. She'll be doing it ri ght here in her room. I will go and get permission from her doctor, and if he says okay will you then approve it? [...] And the nurses said if the doctor says it's okay, then we'll allow it. Well in this case the doctor says yes, definitely le t her do it, and she was able to do the 134 smudge. But the minister said, look, if you don't do this, to the nurses, if you don't let her smudge I will bring the medi a in here, I will bring the Native media in here, and they're going to see how you're treating your Native patients here (TT4 p.27). While some of the Western healthcare staff s till displayed resistance to Indigenous practices, the Chaplain and attending physician both supporte d the practice to smudge. In addition to demonstrating a shift in attitude, one could ar gue that some Western professionals, including healthcare practitioners, have become allies for Indigenous healers and clients/patients, through supporting, sometimes demanding, the ri ght to practice Indigenous healing in mainstream spaces. In reflecting on why this sh ift has begun to occur, TT4 shared, \"I think more and more these institutions are starting to understand why we need to do this\" (TT4 p.28), this being reconnecting I ndigenous individuals with thei r culture through the practice of Indigenous spirituality and culture. Practices integratively, but issues remain . When asked to reflect on whether he believes Indigenous and Western paradigms of health and hea ling can be integrated, TT4 shared that he does not have a problem with the conjoint use of each approach, but stated that Indigenous practitioners will have to shift their practice as well: I have no problem with it. It's just that you're working in a different environment because the medicines will go anywhere. The medicines will work anywhere, and it's just you being able to work in a different kind of environment. Instead of working outside in a sweat, in a lodge, you're working inside of an institution now (TT4 p.34). 135 TT4 shared some examples of how he currently collaborates and practi ces integration, which includes performing ceremonies in Western spaces (hospitals, prisons), such as conducting a pipe ceremony for a patient or providing a tradit ional opening for a prayer room in a hospital, and working closely with other groups of profe ssionals to lobby for client/patient rights: So we began working with this (name of group), and we know a lot of the people there because we've worked with a lot of these Chaplains over the years [...] And we know who the Chaplains usua lly are. So if someone calls us up and wants to do a pipe ceremony, then we can arrange it right away (TT4 p.25). While TT4 believes that integrated practice is occurring, he shared that successfully practiced integration will most likely occur when strong re spectful relationships have been established between Indigenous and Western practitioners: I think it [integration] is happening in a lot of places wh ere there is a good relationship between the Western and th e traditional people and they have a good respect for each other. I think it all stems from respect. Respect is the first Grandfather/Grandmother teaching that we all have to be mindful of and if we don't have that, it's not going to work (TT4 p.29). As has been discussed by many of the Elders in this study, one of th e primary obstacles to practicing integratively is the absence of respectful working relationships and an understanding of Indigenous healing practices. TT4 identified some additional obstacles and issues to integration which included budgeta ry costs (such as funding for the cost of medicines and remuneration for Elders), diffe rences in knowledge systems (intellectual versus spirit logic), and the acceptance of I ndigenous knowledge and healing as a valid and 136 legitimate entity. One strategy that TT4 identifie d to address these issues is increases in education and training for We stern trained professionals. Need for education . While TT4 believed that some shifting of attitudes and practices has occurred, full-scale acceptance of Indigenous ways has not taken place and professionals continue to display resistance or attempt to prohibit the prac tice of Indigenous medicine. TT4 identified the need for more education for We stern professionals to demystify Indigenous practices and create a space for open dialogue and communication. He shared that Indigenous healers and Elders are often not afforded the amount of respect that they would otherwise garner from their community, and additional edu cation related to protocols for working with traditional people is also needed: I know that when our people, our healer s, are say going into a hospital, people should be knowledgeable about who this person is [...] but sometimes they don't get the respect accorded to what the knowledge system that they're bringing in can help this pe rson or this patient. And that's because people don't legitimize our ways of doing things because they don't know. And the only way we're going to educate them into our ways of indigenizing the institutions is to come in and teach them. Like we have to open up that kind of conversation, communication with them, a nd I think that's something that we need to do. We need to do it better, we need to do it better (TT4 p.31). While educational sessions are currently provided by some institutions, TT4 believed that this could be done in a more effective way. It would be interesti ng to examine how many educational programs involve Elde rs or traditional people, vers us administrative individuals or academics facilitating the teaching and training. TT4's hope is that by providing more 137 education and training, greater understanding, re spect, and acceptance of Indigenous ways will occur. The need for more education and training was a recommendation that was cited by several of the Elders in th is study, including the final participant to be reviewed. Participant Five Character sketch . Participant Five chose the identifier \"Traditional her preferred pseudonym. ng possible participants with a community informant, TH5 was suggested as an Elder who practices traditional medicine who has worked extensively in integrated contexts. I ha d met TH5 briefly in the past, but did not have a well-defined personal relationship with her. I emailed TH5 shari ng that she had been recommended to me by a community informant, and provided a brief description of my research topic and asked that she re-contact me if she had any interest in participating. TH5 responded and shared that she t hought my research topic was very important and interesting and said that she was willing to sit for an in terview. TH5 and I completed a first interview together, but have not had the opportunity to da te to schedule a second interview. However, TH5's story map and corresponding core message a nd themes were sent to her over email for her review. First interview . TH5 and I met for dinner before conducting our scheduled interview to get to know one another better. Since I had a standing relationship wi th most of my other participants, I found sharing a meal with TH5 to be helpful in establishing rapport and building trust between one anothe r. Since TH5 does not currently live in the same city as I do, we held our interview in the room of the hotel that she was currently spending the week in while working in the city. I began the interview by reviewing the informed consent form orally and in writing. Once TH5 provided consent, I presented her with a bundled gift of 138 medicine (sage, sweetgrass, cedar, and tobacco ) and presented the (research) question I was seeking knowledge for. TH5 accepted this gift and said that she had a lot of knowledge to share related to the topic. We reviewed my inte rview questions together orally before turning on the audio recorder. TH5 thoughtfully answered each interview question, often checking in with me to ensure that she had answered ade quately. Most of TH5's responses were personal perspectives and experiences related to the su bject matter, with some uses of humour. The interview lasted 90 minutes in length. The initial story map (see Figure 10) was c onstructed during the analysis phase of the initial interview, and a core message and th ree corresponding themes emerged from this interview. Since TH5 and I currently reside in different cities, we deci ded that the story map, core message, and themes should be emailed to TH5 for her review, and any feedback or revisions would be emailed back to me. At th is time I have not received any additional feedback from TH5 and the story map depicted in Figure 10 is considered the final version of her story map. Finale core message and themes . The final core message for TH5 is lack of understanding/respect for Indigenous ways. The three themes are: holistic health, diverse healthcare systems, need for education. Lack of understanding/respect for Indigenous ways . TH5 spoke at multiple points throughout her interview about the lack of understanding and respect for Indigenous medicine and healers that the Western health care system commonly demonstrates. TH5 noted that she is comfortable with acknowledging an d recognizing the strengths of the Western healthcare system, and also makes referrals to Western practitioners if it is appropriate for her clients. However, she feels that the majo rity of Western health care practitioners are 139 Figure 10: Final Story Map: Traditional Healer 5 Self as Elder / TH Indigenous Culture & Medicine Western Medicine Integration (Idea; Forms; Experiences with) Past Experiences o Interest in knowledge o Mentored and taught by many (family, Elders, medicine people) o Differentiated from others o Received gifts (dreams, communicating with spirits, healing hands) o Strong support system (family, teachers, spirits) o Critical life events o Healing journey (overcoming self-doubts) o Assembled bundle / Learned traditions (e.g. listened to the Elders; developed gifts) o Employment (healing centre) o Indigenous epistemology (on spiritual journey o Holistic health (physical, emotional, spiritual, mental) o Effectiveness of Indigenous Medicine o Medicines and methods of healing (e.g. tracking back; spirit guides; ceremony; medicines; healers) o Diversity of healers and methods o Does not respect/understand Indigenous medicines or practices (e.g. Most practitioners do not know what a healer does) o Does not show interest in learning about Indigenous medicine/ways o Absence of holistic perspective o Emphasis is on expediency (focus on trying to fix problem, not examine root causes of problem) o Medical system structured so individuals become reliant on it for health and healing needs o Has worked in differen t integrated contexts o Has experienced effective and successful integrated working relationships o Has experienced ineffective integrated working relationships where she was viewed as threatening [On the Idea] o Can work together -each type of medicine has its strengths o Choice to access diverse systems must remain (individuals of different belief systems will access the corresponding medicine system) [On the Rationale] o Provide different treatment options to individuals Present Experiences o Employment (healing centre) o Healing work (throughout North America; visiting communities) o Provide teaching and training for Western practitioners o Common practice to make referrals to Western practitioners if needed or appropriate o Need for evaluation of healers o Effectiveness of Indigenous Medicine o Has its place and strengths (e.g. mending bones) o Has its limits (e.g. cannot heal all) o Does not respect/understand Indigenous medicines or practices o Does not show interest in learning about Indigenous medicine/ways o Absence of holistic perspective o Emphasis is on expediency o Continues to support individuals' reliance on medical system (e.g. rely on practitioners to fix problem instead of making changes in lifestyle) [How will it occur?] o Respectful working relationships o Education and training for Western practitioners o Streamlined referral systems [Examples and Experiences of Integration] o Teaching Western professionals/practitioners o Integrated place of employment o Have experienced effective and successful integrated working relationships o Have experienced ineffective integrated working relationships where she was viewed as threatening Future Intentions o Encourage communities to recognize credentials and value of healers/Elders o Encourage communities to evaluate different practitioners (both Western and Indigenous) to ensure that they are receiving adequate service o Individuals need to become more self- reliant and attuned with themselves concerning their health and healing needs (e.g. identify and describe pain in stomach) [Issues to be addressed/Steps to be taken] o Differences in notions of health o Credential recognition and training differences o Diverse treatment approaches o Remuneration for Elders and healers o Education/training for Western practitioners o Empirically validate practices (both Indigenous and Western) o Respect demonstrated by Western professionals for Indigenous medicine 140 unable to identify or even describe the work of Indigenous Elders and healers, and fail to recognize the strengths and effectiveness of Indigenous practices: For me as healer, I acknowledge what the Western world does. I acknowledge that a doctor can fix a broken bone, I ac knowledge that they can do surgery and they can fix whatever, if something's wrong with your heart, brain tumours, whatever. So I know about those things. But the struggle I find is that that world don't know about our world, and so they don't have a lot of understanding about how what I do is diffe rent than what they do, but it can be just as valuable because I've helped pe ople that they couldn't help, that the doctors couldn't help (TH5 p.6). TH5 discussed how part of the reason for why Western practitioners fail to see the value in the work of healers is that they do not re spect Indigenous knowledge systems and are not required to familiarize themselves with them in formal educational or professional settings. TH5 shared her experience of attempting to t each Western medical professionals about her peoples' traditional practices for handling de ceased bodies, and how Indigenous knowledge has not only be disregarded by individual practitioners, but by the political and structural systems in Canada and the United States: So when Western physicians, or whatev er, you know the one s who are filling up these bodies with formaldehyde and a ll of that, when they do this, and I know Canada made it a law, or at least in Ontario, that you have to get embalmed, that was against our beliefs, because you're supposed to put that body back in the ground the same way you got it. And so explaining this to a doctor or a coroner, or whatever you want to call them, they had a hard time 141 with that. And that's what I mean, it's the respect of the sp iritual knowledge of Indigenous people that isn't happening. And to me, it's because they don't have to respect it. They're not going to be te sted, they're not goi ng to fail if they don't get it, it's just kind of like a bonus; okay if you understand this part, great. But there's no discip line to them if they don' t get it or if they don't follow it. And I find that it's that same way all over this country and in the United States - Indigenous people, we ha ve knowledge, we have laws that have been given to us, and it's not being valued or acknowledged or there's no discipline for not list ening to it (TH5 p.12). Oftentimes the issue of unders tanding or being wary of Indigenous knowledge and practices has more to do with a lack of education or understanding. However, it is when knowledge and information is shared but continues to be disregarded, or when invitations to share knowledge are extended yet refused, that many Indi genous Elders and healers feel that they themselves, along with their belief system s and practices, are being disrespected: So all peoples have gifts to offer, know ledge to offer, and that's where I find that they're not coming and asking. And ev en though we try to offer it, it's still not valued, to the point of putting it in to the mandatory educational setting. It's almost like they don't want to acknowl edge any wisdom or knowledge that Indigenous people have because a lot of it is deep (TH5 p.14). As noted in this quotation, TH5 feels that one way to address the lack of understanding and disrespect is to formally integrate and expose Western pr actitioners to an Indigenous paradigm of health and hea ling through formal education. 142 Holistic health . TH5 described Indigenous health as being comprised of four elements (mental, emotional, physical, spiritua l) with no one dimensi on being greater than the other. She contrasted this understanding of health to a mo re fractured conceptualization of health that is commonly empl oyed in Western healthcare settings: I know in the Western world they separate and categori ze. Like for instance the mental well-being. So if you go to a doctor and say for instance you have a stomach problem, that's all they look at, and they don't look at, okay why are you eating this way, where did that come from? Did it come from your mother, did she raise you to eat this way, or is it something you're going through? So they don't delve deeper into the mental , emotional, spiritual, and finally the physical of how that happened (TH5 p.6). What is evident from this quotation is that no t only is health conceptu alized holistically, but when health problems do develop, they are explor ed in line with these four dimensions of self and treated holistically. TH5 discusse d how she personally practices from this perspective: So I'm somebody who knows that everything that happens to us physically, just about everything, I mean there's the odd acci dent and things like that, but just about everything that happens to us physically comes from something that happened to us in our lives that was scar y or hurtful or traumatic [...] So when I work with people, that's the way I work with people. It's more of a okay, we got to back up, and that takes time. And th en to actually get to the physical part of fixing somebody, if you just fix them and you don't go to the root of it, it's 143 like snipping a dandelion; it's going to co me back. And so you got to get to the root of why they began this pattern of behaviour (TH5 p.6). TH5 also shared that while the heali ng intervention employed will obviously differ depending on the gifts and abilities of the healer who is doctoring, it is standard practice for healers to holistically examine and then treat health problems: All of us healers do something different . Some just strictly do doctoring and herbal medicine, but then there are so me who just do mostly counselling and that kind of stuff. But you know, overall , most healers do it all, they do the whole, they go from the body to the mind to the emotional to the spiritual (TH5 p.14). One can therefore see how a holis tic understanding of health is used from health problem conceptualization to treatment desi gn and then healing implementation. Diverse healthcare systems . When asked to share her thoughts on the idea of integrating Indigenous and West ern approaches together, one theme which emerged out of TH5's comments are that diverse health sy stems (Western, Indigenous, and others) must remain in order to service individuals of va rying belief systems. For instance, while some Indigenous peoples seek to have their health examined holis tically and are open to using traditional methods, others either prefer to addre ss singular health issues in isolation, or are sceptical of Indigenous appro aches and healers. As TH5 st ated, \"So in a way you kind of need both unless you can change all the people in the world, beliefs, and their understanding about life and their perception about life, unless you can change all that you're going to need both\" (TH5 p.9). However, TH5 was also s upportive of the idea of collaborating with 144 Western healthcare professionals and discussed the use of a referral system between the two as a promising form of collaborative work: I think that they should keep trying to wo rk together because for one thing, it's like what I was saying earlier, that if th e mentality of a person is that okay, if I get an illness or if something happens to me and the doctor wants to see me for 10-15 minutes and give me a pill, I don' t want that. It's like they know as human beings, we know that there is so mething more to why we are depressed, why we are getting sick in our stomach [...] And those ones who are aware of there's something deeper and they want to look at an alternative way of dealing with their problem, other than what the doctor or psychiatri st or psychologist has to offer, they want to look deeper at it, when you come across people like that, to me that's when that's an opport une time to have a healer there, because that's what healers are meant to do. They 're meant to look at those four aspects of somebody and bring it into their spiritual part and help that person to sort those things out (TH5 p.11). The role of the individual's belief system is on ce again noted as an important determinant for which type of healing approach may be acces sed, and TH5 identified those who are looking to holistically examine the root cause of a probl em as ideal candidates for referral. However, TH5 shared that Western practitioners are often unsure of when to make a referral, which is why there is a need for more education and training at this point in time. Need for education . TH5 spoke all throughout her inte rview about the need for more education and training for Western healthcare pr ofessionals. She cited a lack of knowledge as one reason for disrespectful practice by Wester n professionals, and strongly supported the 145 idea of developing curriculum on di verse approaches to healing for individuals training in Western institutions: I think that somewhere in the educati on system of doctors, nurses, all these Western practitioners, if they plan to work in a more holistic setting, that somebody, somewhere, they need to be educated. These institutions should be bringing in traditional heal ers or Elders and giving them an understanding of the value of them [...] Why can I expl ain what a nurse does, what a doctor does, all of that? Because of educati on. But why can doctors and nurses, or psychologists and psychiatrists, not explai n what a traditiona l healer does? It has to do with education or training (TH5 p.12-13). In addition to formalized education, TH5 iden tified the need to provi de individual healers and Elders who are working in mainstream sp aces the opportunity to provide a presentation or workshop on their methods to the other professionals they will be working with: So the best way that Elders and heal ers can be more, I guess, most supported and effective even is when they bring a healer in, they need to set aside a day that that healer can do a presentation or whatever, a teaching, to all of them who is going to work with people, the cl ients, and explain to them what they do, how they do it, or the best they can about how they do it, and who can they recommend to them or something along those lines (TH5 p.15). TH5 stated that this is standard practice in one of the healthcare settin gs that she has worked in which operates from an integrated stance: We would have an orientation day wher e they'd say okay you're going to talk about you and we got some new chiropractic students and we have a new nurse 146 joining us, and so it was up to us to e ducate them as to what we do and who they could recommend [...] Or even if they wanted to come and see us, what we do and what's the protocol? Why do you bring tobacco, and all of that (TH5 p.15). TH5's comments suggest that both the Indige nous and Western practitioners are equally responsible for making sure that they understand each others' type of work, and that they are open to teaching and answering questions about their work. Respect for each other is at the core of this type of collabor ation, and respectful working re lationships were identified as foundational to successful practice across different healing systems. Summary of Chapter Four The within participant analysis was presente d in Chapter Four for the five participants interviewed in this study. Partic ipants shared perspectives and narratives about themselves as Elders or traditional people, Indigenous culture and healing, the Western healthcare system, and the possibility of integrating Indigenous a nd Western approaches to health and healing. Information about each participant was conveyed through a character sketch, along with a description of the first and sec ond interviews. Initial and final story maps, core messages, and themes were detailed, along with a discussion of each message and theme. Chapter Five will contain my presentation of across participant results and analyses. 147 Chapter Five: Discussion of Across Participant Results and Analyses In Chapter Five I present a discussion of the across participant results, highlighting similarities and divergences in opinion and expe rience as related to the overarching research question being answered in this study: What are Indigenous Elders perspectives on the integration of Indigenous and Western heali ng paradigms, and what, if any, are their experiences of working in integrated contexts? Across participant results will be examined in the six following areas: Perspectives on integra tion; rationale for inte gration; conceptual underpinnings of integration; e xpressions and experiences with integration; challenges and issues to be addressed; and recommendations from the Elders. Across participant results and analyses will also be contrasted and compar ed to current theories and literature where relevant, and the chapter will be concluded with a summary. The term \"Elders\" is used to describe th e five participants as a whole. While each participant has selected their own preferred pseudonym to be used when discussing their individual results, each partic ipant has also been recognized as an Elder or Knowledge Keeper (a term connoting similar stature a nd level of knowledge as an Elder) by their communities, which is why I have selected the te rm Elders to refer to the five participants. As was noted in the Results section, the terms \"Indigenous medicine\" and \"Western medicine\" were used by most of the Elders as a shorthand to describe Indigenous health and healing systems and Western health and treatment systems, and the term \"medicine\" encapsulates elements of each healthcare system, including theories of medicine, healing or treatment approaches and interventions, and the respective practitione rs of each type of approach. As well, the Elders discussed how integrative efforts may be practiced in the 148 various Western healthcare systems, given thei r holistic understanding of health, despite the initial focus of this thesis being solely on the Western mental health sector. Perspectives on Integration All five Elders believed that there is th e potential for some form of collaborative or integrated practice between Indigenous and We stern health and healing paradigms to take place. However, the Elders reported a diverse number of perspectives and experiences with integrated practice, and each Elder defined inte gration differently. For instance, while Elder 1 and Traditional Teacher 4 expressed support for attempts to integrate practices today, and shared several examples of how they themselv es have practiced it, Witness 2 shared her belief that individuals and organizations have rushed into merging the two approaches together. As was identified in her core message , Witness 2 feels that Indigenous peoples must first reclaim their knowledge prio r to collaborating with the We stern healthcare system so that each system is equipped with equal amounts of knowledge and no abuses of power occur: I don't think that with two completely different transmission systems like that that it can work right now. Unless we have the time, the space, and the opportunity, and the finances, to reclaim all of our knowledge. Not just the bits about tobacco and sweetgrass and cedar , you know what I'm saying? I mean the science, the whole system. And then once that's done, once our people then have access to our knowledge, then all of us together can talk about, now how does this fit with Western knowledge (W2 p.5). While Elder 3 commented that she would be open to practicing Indi genous healing in Western spaces, \"Like I would go to (name of hospital) if I could smudge and all that\" (E3b 149 p.3), she tends to not presently work in ma instream spaces as Indigenous knowledge and healing practices, in her experience, are proh ibited and disrespected. She also expressed, along with Traditional Teacher 4 and Traditional Healer 5, the be lief that diverse healthcare systems must remain in order to service indivi duals of different belief systems or those who do not wish to heal in an I ndigenous informed manner: \"let's say cancer, okay, it is your choice whether you want to choose the dominan t culture way or our traditional way\" (E3b p.1). Several of the Elders commented that many Indigenous people ar e disconnected from traditional knowledge systems and sometimes expr ess scepticism or disinterest in Indigenous ways, \"unity is our biggest problem facing us today, unity, number one I think across the board. A lot of our own people don't even beli eve in the traditiona l Indigenous knowledge systems\" (TT4 p.29). The significance that is afforded to Indigenous culture, Indigenous identity, and methods of healing will obviously differ across individuals , and it is important to not assume that every Indi genous person will want to ac cess traditional methods when addressing health problems. It is for this reason th at three of the five Elde rs indicated that it is important to not pressure an indi vidual into one form or way of healing, and that if interest is expressed in Indigenous methods, that thos e systems then be made accessible through referrals to healers or integr ated programs in existence: A lot of our own people don't even believe in the traditional Indigenous knowledge systems, and that's fine, that 's okay. We allow freedom of choice, and (name of person) and I always expl ain this, none of this is forced on anybody. You have a choice, you don't have to do this if you don't want to do this. If you do choose to do this, good, we'll explain what we're doing (TT4 p.29). 150 The overarching message that was expressed by the Elders is that while Indigenous and Western approaches to healing may be successfu lly practiced at some point in time, it is important to not assume what a client's treatme nt preferences will be based solely on cultural background. Instead, an array of op tions for treatment must conti nue to be presented to meet individual peoples healing needs, which ultimatel y may or may not be an integrated form of treatment. Rationale for Integration In discussing motivations or a rationale for the integration of Indigenous and Western paradigms, Traditional Teacher 4 shared his belie f that strengths exist in both Indigenous and Western approaches and that utilizing the advantageous aspects of each system can potentially deliver more powerful healing for his people. Traditional Teacher 4 illustrated how he personally practices a form of integration by smudging his insulin: When I get my insulin, like I'm diabe tic, when I get my insulin I smudge it because I know I'm going to be injecti ng it into me to help breakdown those sugars and carbohydrates. So I mean I accept that we walk in both worlds so it makes sense that we should be taking the best from the Western world and using the best from our world and bringi ng them together to help ourselves so that we can go out there a nd help others (TT4 p.31). Traditional Teacher 4 highlighted the fact that many Indigenous peoples perceive themselves as walking in two worlds, which oftentimes enta ils the use of dual medical systems for health and healing needs. All five of the Elders spoke throughout thei r interviews about the critical role that Indigenous culture (plant medicines, communit y, cultural identity, traditional diet, ceremony, 151 Elders and healers, spirituality, etcetera) pl ays in fostering and maintaining health and providing healing for health problems, which has been well documented in the literature (e.g. McCabe, 2007; Garrett & Wilbur, 1999; Kirmay er 1988; Poonwassie & Charter, 2005; Vicary & Bishop, 2005). However, Elder 1 and Traditional Teacher 4 cited spirituality as particularly vi tal to healing. Traditional Teacher 4 shared a teaching that he received from one of his mentor s who used the term \"spiritual pastoral care\" to describe the essential nature of spir itual practice for many Indigenous peoples. In discussing how purification ceremonies (such as smudging) are often a primary aspect of spiritual pastoral care, Traditional Teacher 4 also outlined why the practice of smudging should ideally be made available in Western healthcare settings: And I remember him saying that our spir itual and personal care requires that we smudge and it's part of our belief syst em, it's part of our protocol, that we do this to let go of all of the burdens of life, the distractions, because now we will be going into surgery and we want to have a good mind and good faith that everything is going to work out. So it became important, especially in a setting like that, that smudging be made available (TT4 p.25). Several authors and researchers have also identified the importa nce of Indigenous spirituality in health and healing (e.g. Duran, 2006; Garrett & Wilbur, 1999; McCormick, 2005). One study conducted by McCabe (2007) resulted in his eight research pa rticipants identifying several elements of Indigenous spiritua lity (e.g. understand ing inner and unknown experience; the sacred teachings; ceremonies and rituals; belief in a healing spirit) as core conditions for successful healing work. With re spect to the idea of integration, Elder 1 and 152 Traditional Teacher 4 cited the need to practice spirituality as a rationale for integrated practice: I think more and more these institutions are starting to understand why we need to do this. If we go in there with the right attitude and sharing that this is how our people will become culturally acclimat ed to finding your spirit, and that's basically what we want. We want to be able to connect w ith your own spirit and we can do that, if you can help th em, accommodate that to do that, then that's what you should be doing, and we're here to tell you that's one way to do it. So let's do it, let's do it together (TT4 p.28). In describing the goal of much healing work as re-establishing an individual's connection with their culture and spirituality (through the us e of Elders, ceremony, me dicines, etcetera), Elder 1 and Traditional Teacher 4 expressed th at these spiritual practices should be made available to Indigenous peoples who ar e doing healing work in Western spaces. Related to the importance of making spiritua lity available to Indigenous clients is the need to provide holistic forms of treatment to Indigenous individuals who are looking to explore the interrelationships be tween dimensions of health ( physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual). Given that the Elders in this study tended to discus s all four aspects of well-being in relation to health and healing (despite the in itial focus of this thesis on mental health needs), and often commented on the healthcare practices of many different Western-trained healthcare professionals and organi zations, one suggestion for integr ated care is to not solely focus on how one element of well-being can be integrated with I ndigenous practices (e.g. mental health and Indigenous healing), but how a movement towards multidisciplinary treatment and care can be organized and implemen ted. Traditional Healer 5 raised this as a 153 point of discussion in suggesti ng that efforts need to be focused on developing streamlined referral systems between Western and Indigeno us practitioners for individuals who are looking to examine their health holistically. I would go one step further in suggesting that emphasis should perhaps be placed on assembli ng circles of care (or treatment teams made up of diverse healthcare professionals such as psychologists, doctors, nutritionists, Indigenous healers) for patients/ clients who are seeking to a ccess both healthcare systems or who wish to examine their health holistica lly. Referral systems and multidisciplinary team approaches to client care repr esent two potential expressions of integrated practice, yet the foundational elements for building such relations hips must first be identified before any attempts at organizing such multidisciplinary networks of care can occur. Conceptual Underpinnings to Integration All five Elders identified so me foundational under pinnings that would need to be in place in order for successful working relati onships to develop between Indigenous and Western parties. First, recognition of the st rengths and limitations of each approach would need to occur by both Indigenous and Western pr actitioners. While four of the five Elders identified several strengths of the Western healthcare system, a ll five Elders shared their felt experience of the Western syst em's failure to recognize the effectiveness of Indigenous ways. This lack of acknowledgement continues to occur despite a gr owing body of research which has demonstrated the efficacy of Indigenous approaches to healing (e.g. Goudreau et al., 2008; Heilbron & Guttman, 2000; Wagemakers Schiff & Moore, 2006), something which the Western healthcare system often insists on, despite the historical legacy of Indigenous healing systems and personal testaments to th e efficacy of Indigenous approaches. All five Elders provided several examples of successf ul healing outcomes, for a diverse number of 154 health problems, through the use of Indige nous practices, and discussed achieving success with ailments that the Western h ealthcare system failed to remedy: When it came to, for instance, degenerative disorder, or whatever that's called, where the discs start to deteriorate, th ey couldn't operate on him because it was in too much of a sensitive area with the nerves. And I did doctoring on them and they were without pain; it had st opped, like what the doctor said was going to happen, it stopped and they were okay (TH5 p.6). Three of the five Elders di scussed the Western system's treatment limitations when addressing certain health problems (such as sp ecific types of cancer), and how the system often turns away or abandons their patients if they have exercised a ll of their resources, \"We've had many occasions where Western medi cine, where doctors have said, 'Well we've done all we can for this person.' The way they say it is 'It's up to them now'\" (E1 p.9). At the same time, a growing shift in attitude a nd an openness to Indigenous methods has been demonstrated by some professionals, including clergy and religious figures working in prison systems: I went to (name of detention centre). Th e guy came right to me, right next door to my wife's apartment on (name of stre et) there. We had a Chaplain who was telling me that there's things that he as a Chaplain, realizes that his message isn't the right message for many of the A boriginal men who were in the jails. And if you would come, we'd pray you come (E1 p. 15). Elder 1 continued to describe how this Chaplain 's request for services resulted in a powerful healing experience for the Abor iginal male inmates who participated in the weekly healing circle that Elder 1 facilitate d. What was unique to this collaborative encounter was that in 155 addition to the Chaplain's r ecognition of the strengths of Elder 1's approach, and the limitations of his own, he also exhibited an acceptance of another worldview, epistemology, and method for healing. All five Elders repeatedly discussed th e lack of understand ing, respect for, and acceptance of Indigenous knowledge and approach es to healing by the Western healthcare system. According to the Elders, in order for any type of collaborative work to occur, full- scale acceptance of one another's approach mu st take place. In recounting a conversation with a Western healthcare professional about how Indigenous and Western practitioners can work together, Witness 2 described how a belief in the potential power of each approach is crucial if symbiotic work is to occur: He says okay I get it, I get it, so I have to shift. And I said what you have to do is face that both medical approaches require beliefs that have no foundation. In order for me to go to a Western docto r I have to believe that pills are appropriate, and so I go and I know that he's going to prescribe me pills (W2 p.30). The requirement for unconditional acceptance of diverse understandings and approaches most closely resembles Duran's (2006) notion of epistemological hybridism, which is the idea that two or more ways of knowing can co -exist harmoniously. As was discussed in the review of the literature, the practice of episte mological hybridism does aw ay with the idea of attempting to prove or demonstrate the legi timacy of experience through various methods (often Western empirical processes) and r ecognizes knowledge or experiences as valid merely because they represent the real life wo rld of another. All five Elders identified the ability to practice epistemological hybridism as a structural requirement for collaborative or 156 integrative endeavours. Furthermore, severa l of the Elders associated acceptance of Indigenous ways as a form of respect, which was the third foundational element for successful working relationships. Without a re ceptivity and regard for Indigenous knowledge systems and Indigenous practices and practitioners, coll aborative work is not possible. This notion has direct implications for policy a nd legislation, as acceptance and respect for Indigenous approaches would see organizational or st ructural changes in creating space for the practice of Indigenous methods, and adheren ce to the lawful rights of Indigenous peoples to practice their spiritual belief systems. As has been noted above, the prohibition of Indigenous ceremony (e.g. smudging) in Western sp aces is often interpreted as a sign of disrespect by certain Elders, and a form of racism by other Elders in this study. Two Elders spoke metaphorically about th e conceptual underpinnings for integration. For instance, Witness 2 used the analogy of woven baskets to describe how an Indigenous approach and a Western approach could be bl ended together, while speaking about the need to reclaim Indigenous knowledge: \"It's like my basket's nearly empty, their basket's full. And we're going to bring them together? That means that their basket is going to be on top of our basket, as opposed to woven together\" (W 2 p.11). Witness 2 conceptualized possible integration, or what she referred to as a concatenation of theori es, as consisting of knowledge systems which are equal in depth and strength an d that are meticulously or strategically fused together to create a new entity. Traditional Teach er 4, in sharing a historical teaching about a constitutional document which is referred to as The Great Law, described how Indigenous and European peoples were able to come t ogether to collaborate in translating this Indigenous constitution into English: 157 He said I'll do that on the condition th at you learn the Onondaga language. So Goldweiser had some work to do. It took him eight years but he learned it. He came back to Six Nations, he knocked on (name of person)'s door and he spoke to him in Onondaga...So he started talk ing, laughing and joking like old friends right? And he says well, you kept your e nd of the promise, your side, I guess I should keep mine. So over the course of time they proceeded to translate [...] they would have these areas in the reci tation of the Great Law that they could not find a good translation that reflected accurately what they wanted to say. So Goldweisser, it took him two years, taught them German, taught them high German. So they all learned how to speak German. So when they came to these areas of translation problems, they woul d include German mode, and they were able to come to words that would sa tisfy everybody. So that's how they got over those rough areas (TT4 p.11). In this teaching, Traditional Teacher 4 outlined some of the challenges and the type of commitment that is required by both collaborating parties to ensure a successful outcome is achieved. While the European individual in this story was required to learn an Indigenous language, difficulties still arose in the translatio n process. It was with the introduction of a third language (German), an alternative method for thinking and communicating, that challenges were overcome. In thinking about the endeavour to blend Indigenous and Western approaches together, it might be expected that as challenges arise, innovative means and new forms of relating and communicating will have to be identified, as new land is charted between Indigenous and Western worlds. 158 Expressions and Experiences with Integration All five Elders indicated that they had at one point in time practiced collaborative or integrative work with either Western health care practitioners or or ganizations/institutions. However, four of the five Elde rs also described poor or unsuc cessful attempts at integration. Before describing the successful experiences and various expressions or levels of integration discussed by the Elders, two examples of unsuccessful attempts to practice alongside Western circles are reviewed. Unsuccessful or poor experien ces with attempted integration included prohibiting or attempting to prohibit the performance of ceremony or use of Indigenous medicines in Western spaces, and the maltreatment of Indigenous healers by Western healthcare professionals. Traditional Teacher 4 shared an example of a patient requesting to have a purification ceremony performed, w ith the request for the smudging initially being refused: I remember down here at (name of pl ace), there was one lady, Ojibway lady from (name of place), her last wish was to be able to smudge in her room because she knew she was dying. And they said no, she's got to go outside. The nurses said this, she has to go outside (TT4 p.27). Traditional Teacher 4 stated that with the ai d of the hospital's Chaplain and the patient's attending physician, the request to smudge was eventually approved. This type or level of integration, which was discussed in the review of the literature, is an example of attempting to introduce Indigenous healing methods without a paradigmatic aligning of approaches. It will remain to be seen whether the practice of Indigenous healing methods in the absence of an epistemologically hybri d stance is possible. 159 Traditional Healer 5 also described poor experiences with attempted integrative practice in describing the will ingness of Western healthcare staff to collaborate with a traditional healer, \"I've worked in places where a lot of the West ern practitioners saw me as a threat or saw me as a waste of space\" (TH5 p.15) . This example raises the issue of individual practitioners' level of readiness and enthusiasm to practice integratively, and along with that, poor attitudes or scepticism of the strengths and effectiveness of Indigenous approaches, which has been discussed by other resear chers and authors (Crowe-Salazar, 2007; LaFromboise, 1988; Waldram et al., 2007). As highlighted here, even though movement towards integrated practice may occur at an or ganizational or administrative level, challenges may persist at the individual practitioner leve l. Recommendations for how to address these challenges will be discussed in the upcoming section. In the review of the literature, I described multiple levels or potential expressions of integrated practice, which included a paradigm atic aligning of approaches, the introduction of Indigenous healing methods and healers into Western spaces, the formation of collaborative working relationships between In digenous and Western prof essionals for either the purposes of referral or bu ilding a treatment te am of care, integrated programming, and organizations which have been established on the premise of an integrated approach to healthcare (e.g. Anishnawbe Health Toronto). All of these levels or expressions of integration were discussed by the Elders, of tentimes through the retelling of personal experiences of working in these diverse contexts and systems. A paradigmatic aligning of Indigenous and Western approaches would entail an exploration and identification of shared a nd dissimilar understandings of the health, and healthcare systems, that are currently in pl ace, followed by a revi sion and unification of 160 approaches into a coalesced paradigm and approach. Witness 2 identified the term concatenation as best representing her understanding of this endeavour: I think it's concatenate really, is prob ably a better word. I think it's linked. I think the links need to be made. But the link is in the theory of each medicine. It has to come together in a different way (W2 p.16). Concatenation here refers to a linking in th e theory of each approach, which would then inform practice, and Witness 2 noted that the two systems must \"come together\" in a different way. In discussing one method for pa radigmatic aligning, Duran (2006) advocated that Western mental health workers revisit th e original meaning of psychotherapist (soul- healer) and psychopathology (soul suffering), and shift root metaphors from psychologizing to spiritualizing (p. 19). As has been well-established by the literature and the participants in this study, the role of spirituality for Indige nous peoples in health and healing cannot be overstated, but is one aspect, among many, that n eed to be addressed and discussed if an aligning or concatenation of Indigenous and Western systems is to occur. Four of the five Elders described expe riences with practici ng Indigenous healing methods (specific ceremonies as facilitated by Elders and healers) in Western spaces. For instance, Elder 1 stated that he often receives phone calls from the hospital system to come in and provide healing for one of their patients: So even now I get calls from the hosp itals: 'Sometimes they're not... So could you?' Okay. So I come, I come with my bundle of medicines. Some of them see me, they just see me come in and ri ght away they start that healing, that healing process starts, when they see me come in. Whatever I say, or whatever I do, it's all healing to them b ecause it's a transition time (E1 p.9). 161 This represented a successful form of integr ated work for Elder 1, however, as has been noted above, other Elders have been mistreated or denied th e opportunity to practice their medicines in hospital environments. One of th e key differentiating factors with the example provided by Elder 1 is that the hospital demonstrated a willingness and acceptance of this approach in asking him to perform ceremony in its space. It would appear that the introduction and use of Indigenous methods in Western spaces may be successfully practiced as long as the foundational element of accepta nce of Indigenous methods is in place. Two of the Elders described forming co llaborative relationshi ps with individual Western healthcare professionals as a form of integrated practice. For instance, Traditional Healer 5 described how in one workplace setti ng, the Western healthcare staff were required to make appointments with the traditional healers to discuss the nature of their work and when it would be appropriate to make referrals: When a doctor, a nurse, any of them, I think the psychologist too, when they came on board to work at (name of Native organization) what they had to do was come make an appointment with a h ealer and find out what we do so then they can recommend people based on what they know (TH5 p.14). Traditional Healer 5 identified the use of a refe rral system as a potentially powerful form of collaborative work that would be of gr eat benefit to Indigenous clients. Traditional Teacher 4 provided several exam ples of how he has collaborated with Western professionals. He desc ribed two instances of providi ng Indigenous medicines to Chaplains working in both the prison system and hospital systems so that Indigenous healing was possible for the inmates and patients: \"We wo rked with the prison, th e jail (name of jail), and we've done the same thing. Through their Chaplain we try to make smudging available 162 to the Native inmates. So we provide them with sweetgrass if we can get it\" (TT4 p.25). Traditional Teacher 4 also described a type of collaborative work not commonly discussed in the literature, which is working in partnership with Western pr ofessionals for the purposes of advocacy and policy development: Well there's this group that we belong to [...] but it's like a spiritual care advisory committee that works with all th e churches, and it's all the Chaplains again. And through them we're able to get a lot of things, we're able to move a lot of things on our agenda, try and get accommodation, but we couldn't do it on our own. It just wouldn't happen. So fortunately the Chaplains who approached us saw the validity and legi timacy of what we're doing and they says hey, you're on to something a nd we should be doing that (TT4 p.27). Several key points of discussion ar e highlighted in this example of collaborative work. First, Traditional Teacher 4 stated that the Chap lains recognized the strengths of Indigenous approaches, which as discussed above, re presents a foundationa l underpinning to the establishment of successful working relations hips for the Elders in this study. Second, Traditional Teacher 4 commented that it is with the aid of this group of professionals that he and other traditional healers are able to advo cate for the needs of Indigenous peoples, and without their support at this point in time, he questioned how successful their lobbying would be. The fact that Traditional Teach er 4 feels that his and other tr aditional healers' attempts to create policy change would not be successful wit hout the aid of this group of professionals is indicative of the current lack of respect and acceptance of Indigenous healing systems and its practitioners by larger society. Ho wever, this type of collaborative work was identified as a successful form of practice by Traditional Teache r 4, and also formed the basis of his belief 163 that changes in attitudes towards Indigenous h ealing systems are occurring, and that some Western professionals are regarded as alli es for Indigenous peoples in supporting their healing needs today. Elder 1 and Traditional Teacher 4 descri bed running formal programs, both of which were group or circle based, and consisted of eith er an Indigenous healing circle being run in a Western space, or a heali ng circle which integrated both Indigenous and Western philosophies and approaches togeth er. Elder 1 described some of the healing work that he has performed in the jail system and the positive outcomes for the inmates in this program: And the first time I went in there, (name of detention centre), I had about five or six Aboriginal people co me. And they were so glad for my medicines! I had my medicine bundle thing [motions to me dicines laid out on floor], and it was probably a different bag, but I had ever ything out there, and I had my drum, I used to have a waterdrum, and I shared it. And they just liked my stuff so much! They listened and they listened, and I talked about the medicines (E1 p. 15). In addition to noting the succe sses of this program for the inmates, Elder 1 communicated some of the comments he received from the prison staff who worked closely with the Aboriginal men that participated in the circle, \"The jail guards and stu ff like that, 'That's the best thing ever done, when you come here. The whole thing seems to go peaceful'\" (E1p. 17). Given that all three parties (Elder, inmate s, and guards) observed the successes of a program such as this being run in a Western sp ace, more research designed to examine the successful implementation and the beneficial asp ects of this type of programming are needed and represent a fertile area for future research. 164 One final expression of integration which was discussed by Traditional Healer 5 was her experience as a traditional healer at an agency which was based on an integrated approach to healthcare. Traditional Healer 5 re ferenced her experiences of working at this agency all throughout her interview and disc ussed the processes in place for educating Western healthcare staff about the work of tr aditional healers, how streamlined referrals between traditional healing and Western practiti oners were established, and how Western and Indigenous practitioners worked together as part of a treatment team to consult and design treatment plans for clients: I've had instances where if I was seeing a client that one of the Western doctors was seeing and he or she wanted to give me a heads up about this client, like 'I've been seeing this client for four year s, this is the medication they've been taking, this is what they've said is ha ppened, da da da, but I'm thinking maybe this has happened. Do you think maybe you could see like go towards that direction and see whatever has happen ed?' So I've had conversations with doctors and psychologists and psychiatrists, and all of that, where we actually make a team effort on somebody to best help them (TH5 p.15). One similar treatment agency that was discussed in the review of the literature was the Knaw Chi Ge Win service located in Northern Ontario (see Maar et al., 2009). Similar to Traditional Healer 5's comments and recomm endations, education for Western healthcare professionals was identified as a key compone nt to effective integrated practice and good working relationships between Indigenous and We stern trained staff. The use of a referral system was also discussed by both the staff of the Knaw Chi Ge Win service and Traditional Healer 5, and may represent one of the primar y expressions of integration currently in 165 practice today. As more agencies and organizati ons that specialize in integrated treatment grow in number, the need for research whic h examines how Indigenous and Western staff work together and negotiate challenges as they arise will be critical to enhancing the success of these programs. Given the amount of experience with integrat ed practice that the five Elders in this study reported, and the growing demand for thei r services in Western spaces, one are of inquiry that was addressed wa s how these integrated and collaborative endeavours would occur or develop. Elder 1 shared his belief that it is Aboriginal pe ople themselves who are going to be the force behind the movement to practice their spiritual needs in Western healing spaces: \"Our people will bring them t ogether. Our people. Aboriginal people in these care facilities, or whatever, they need to sa y, 'Ah, you're medicines don' t work. Give me my own medicines!'\" (E1 p.11). Severa l of the Elders also identified that Western professionals were the ones who initially appr oached them to provide servi ces, often after recognition of the limitations of their own approach. Howeve r, three of the five Elders discussed how Indigenous protocols are in pla ce for establishing working re lationships with Indigenous healers, and that while many Elders and healers are will ing and available to work collaboratively, the establishment of relations hips must be done in a respectful way: We're available, our healers are available, but they have to come to us and ask us in the right way. They have to respect us. They can't just expect something to happen without there being some kind of respectful protocol of how we're going to work together (TT4 p.33). These protocols are often in pl ace to facilitate the negotiatio n of a working contract, which all five Elders identified as a significant element of collaborative work: 166 If Dr. Smith wants to work with a healer then they have to find a healer to work with. And the very moment they find them, that person and him have to negotiate an arrangement, and that's a contract (W2 p.31). Shore, Shore, and Manson (2009) outlined the process by which Western mental health practitioners established worki ng relationships with traditiona l healers when attempting to work integratively with American Indian wa r veterans. While the authors list the specific activities that the mental health practitioners participated in, the findings from this study indicate that the core component for successful relationships is an epistemologically hybrid stance, which entails an acceptance and respect for diverse knowledge and healing systems, a frankness in identifying the strengths and weakne sses in each approach, and a willingness to explore how the beneficial elements of each a pproach may be blended together. Processes for establishing relationships will obviously di ffer depending on the Elder's or healer's willingness to work collaboratively, and th eir specific protocols for relationship development. While the Elders in this st udy reported a great amount of success with integrated healing work to date, they also id entified various challenges and issues with the concept and practice of Indigenous a nd Western integrated healthcare. Challenges to Integration All five Elders identified va rious challenges or issues which need to be addressed prior to the wide spread practi ce of integrated healthcare. Witness 2 highlighted some of the different areas which require attention in stating: First there's knowledge that has to be put in our basket, we have to put knowledge in our basket. The second thi ng is we have to quarrel about whose beliefs we're going to start with or are we just going to accept each others 167 fundamental belief? And thirdly, what ar e some of the issues. So those steps have to be taken. I don't think we're going to be doing it in a big hurry (W2 p.11). The various challenges listed have been grouped under the three following headings: Historical relationships, diffe rences in epistemologies and treatment approaches, and differences in knowledge acquisition and traini ng, and will be explored in the following paragraphs. Historical relationships. Elder 3, who expressed the most reservations about the idea of integrated practice, cited historical events and the failure of the Canadian government and Canadian society to honour the original agr eements made between Indigenous peoples and European settlers as an obstacle to forming re lationships with the Western healthcare system today: So we had the treaties, we have the en counters with the settlers, and we smoked our pipes with them, we made treaties with them, the two row wampum, and all that, but how many of them really respect that now? Do truly really believe in that? Because our people went in there with a respect, tobacco was given, but there was no understanding from the settle rs in there. Now we don't even have our rights. How can they heal when they disrespect another culture? (E3b p.2) For Elder 3, the continued denial of Indigenous people's rights as Nations, communities, and individuals is too large an in justice to ignore and does not provide a solid foundation from which to build new relationships with hea lthcare professionals t oday. This concern has informed Elder 3's decision to not typically practice in Western spaces, and while she 168 remains open to the idea, a number of challe nges must first be addressed prior to her practicing integratively. Differences in epistemology and treatment approach. Differences in logic systems, conceptualizations of health, philosophies of treatment, and treatment interventions were cited as challenging areas requiring discussion by the Elders in this study. First, Witness 2 and Traditional Teacher 4 identified differe nces in logic systems as an area requiring attention. For instance, Witness 2 stated that much of Indigenous culture is based on spiritual logic, whereas Western culture is based on math ematical logic. In discussing the types of research endeavours of Western and Indigenous researchers, she stated: So what's the rules, that's the thing. If we have to accept their logic, then they should have to accept ours. Ours is a spirit ual logic and theirs is a mathematical logic. If they say well this is re search because it's going to make the pharmaceutical companies rich, I'll accept that, but this is also research and it's not going to make anybody rich, but it's as valid. And we're going to research, say shape shifting, or something. Yeah, we 're going to apply Einstein's theory of relativity to shape sh ifting and see what we come up with. And it should be just as valid, but it's not. So what's th e level of belief and validity that we need to have between us even to enga ge in the convers ation? (W2 p.9) The significance of differences in logic systems is that knowledge, its creation and dissemination, is informed by and investigated through different avenues or means. For instance, Witness 2 highlighted the fact that much of Western knowledge and research is accepted as valid because it is mathematical a nd quantifiable in nature. However, methods for researching spiritual knowledge are limite d, and the idea of sp iritual knowledge or 169 spiritual relations is often disregarded by Western modes of thinking as illegitimate and nonsensical. Dismissal of spiritu al logic and knowledge poses a significant challenge to any attempts at integration, as it is a fundamental aspect of many Indigenous epistemologies and one of the four elements of we ll-being generally considered to be a factor for health and healing. As Traditional Healer 5 stated: So that's the problem I can see as a challenge, is I guess one, the Western practitioners aren't knowle dgeable enough about what traditional healing or spiritual healing or holistic, or whatever you want to call it, is and how it works and the value of it [...] I think a lot of practitioners don't understand what makes my work effective, more effectiv e, because it goes into all of that, the spiritual aspect, the spiritua l needs, mental, emotional, physical, all of that is combined (TH5 p.7). A difference in conceptions of health represen ts a second area of divergence between much of Indigenous and Western thinking, and has be en discussed by other researchers and authors in the literature (e.g. Crowe-Salazar, 2007; Gone, 2010). However, it is not only conceptualizations of health (segmented vs. holistic understand ings) that are different, but how health problems themselves are understood (i solated issues vs. inte rconnected with other areas of health). Witness 2 provided an ex ample of how psychological phenomena is understood and approached differently in discus sing the processing of traumatic experiences: We need to know how you reacted to that. You're obviously traumatized but how did you react to it? What was the fi rst thing that you did? Well lots of people jump out of their body. White soci ety recognizes that happens, but they don't recognize it as a phenomena. Now how that works is quite beyond me in 170 the same mind, but I've seen it. They'll say, 'If they did jump out of their body you have to get them to come back. We ll they're not actually out of their body, they just think that.' But you just told me that person jumped out of her body, so actually you don't believe it. Is that the deal? Me, I be lieve it, so I got to get this person back into their body. And so I'll ask the person, so when you jump out of your body where do you actually go ? And you know some of them float on the ceiling (W2 p.27). Here one can see how the spiritual dimension is implicated and informs the processing of psychological trauma; if the person's spirit is not within the body, the problem persists. In this example, the first step in healing work for Witness 2 is to restore the individual's connection with the spirit and examine the emo tional elements in conjunction with that. In Western psychological terms, this is often conceptualized as dissociation from the body, however, as Witness 2 pointed out, it is not commonly regarded as a disconnection from spirit, but instead, a shift in le vels of consciousness. Such dive rse views of health and health problems also have implications for how pract itioners understand the goals of healing work. Elder 1 described the focus of much I ndigenous healing work as restoring the connection between the logical a nd spiritual aspects of being, \"A lot of times there's a disconnect here [motions to head] and there [m otions to heart/spirit] , and a lot of times I think that I'm that connection; that I restor e that connection, along w ith this [motions to Indigenous medicines that have been laid on floor], and the language, the prayers, and the smiles\" (E1 p.9). Elder 1 once again articulated the importance of interrelationship between different dimensions of health, and the dive rse methods or medicines that are used to facilitate the healing process. Traditional T eacher 4 also identified the various levels of 171 healing that are related to community and the larger cosmos in citing one of his teachers, \"(Name of person) used to always say, first we heal as an individual, th en we heal as family, then we heal as community, we heal as clan, then we heal as Nations. And as Nations, when we heal, it's up to us to heal mother earth\" (TT4 p.9). Several author s have identified the importance of community with respect to i ndividual healing (e.g. Kirmayer et al., 2003; LaFromboise, 1988; McCormick, 1996; Stewart, 2008), but community level healing is often an important area for focus as well, as interrelationships with other human beings, Nations, and entities (e.g. earth) impacts well-b eing on an individual level. Differences in understandings of the purpose of healing work also informs the philosophy and approach to healing or treatment that is taken, and was iden tified as another area where dissimilarity often exists between Indigenous and Western systems. Witness 2 and Traditional Healer 5 shared their belief that the current Western healthcare system has created a milieu of over-reliance and dependence in which individuals rely on the system for all their healing needs. Witness 2 stated: I mean on the one hand a medical plan is great because it al lows people to get attention when they need it, but what it did was make us completely reliant on seeing a doctor. Consult your physician [... ] There's lots of ways to heal something and we have to take more re sponsibility for our wellness. If you're 34 and you're in good shape, how do you maintain that? (W2 p.16-17). Related to the idea of reliance is the notion of assuming personal responsibility for health and wellness, which Witness 2, Traditional Teacher 4, and Traditional Healer 5 all spoke about. While all three Elders felt it was important to seek medical attention when one is concerned about their health, they also discussed how the individual must be accountable for 172 implementing changes in their attitudes and/or be haviours to ensure that health problems are corrected (e.g. reducing weight to avoid cardi ac difficulties, versus medication use alone). One resultant challenge of the current structure of the healthcare system is that the system is commonly overtaxed, as it is fair ly common to find that indi viduals must wait weeks at a time to access certain healthcare programs or specialists. One implication of this, which several of the Elders identified, is that much of the medical healthcare system is focused on expediency and treating sy mptomatology, versus thoroughl y examining the root or underlying causes of health difficulties: What I find is, for the most part, they just want to get somewhat of an idea of what the problem is and then guess at a prescription, or try this and try that. Like it's more about time. What I find is they don't like to spend a whole lot of time with somebody to get to the root of the physical problem (TH5 p.6). The use of medication as a primary form of treat ment was identified by three of the Elders as a troubling form of practice. As has been not ed throughout, a diversity of Indigenous healing methods or medicines exist, which vary from ceremony, to the use of story, to singing and drumming. As Elder 1 noted: If we pray or sing, because to sing is to do medicine upon the body, because singing, if you're plus-minus, plus-mi nus [motions polar opposites in body], they're all jumbled up, and so you straight en them up and make it in a line, and that's healing, because you heal the en ergy fields, and energy all of a sudden flows, and you get the energy fixed up [la ughs] and that person is better again! (E1 p. 9) 173 The use and acceptance of diverse healing or trea tment interventions is another area in need of discussion and consensus. As was discussed in the review of the literature, the movement towards empirically based practice in the West ern psychological profession raises a number of concerns related to the ev aluation of Indigenous healing methods. This issue will be further discussed in an upcoming section, howev er, agreements will have to be made with respect to the empirical base required for the use of certain inte rventions or healing approaches when practicing integratively. A dditionally, the practice of epistemological hybridism is of crucial importance in being able to recognize the power ful healing potential of diverse methods. Knowledge acquisition and training. All five of the Elders discussed issues related to processes of attaining knowledge and acquiring gifts and the honing of skills for Indigenous Elders and healers. In discussing the steps that need to occur prior to integration, Witness 2 highlighted some of the differen ces between Western and Indigenous forms of knowledge acquisition in stating: The distribution of knowledge amongst Europeans is very different. You have to earn knowledge, which is stupid, you know? Like you have to get an A to move on to the next level of acquiring knowledge [...] That's not how it works in our community. Any, all knowledge be longs to everyone [...] I don't think that with two completely different transmission systems like that that it can work right now (W2 p.4-5). Witness 2 referred here to the elitist nature of the Western education sy stem and contrasted it to Indigenous methods for knowledge sharing. Elder 1, who possesses a Western graduate degree, reflected on how this type of educati on has removed barriers to his working in the 174 Western healthcare system, as his degree is recognized and accepted by Western healthcare professionals: Maybe they [other Elders] haven't gone to education, university, stuff like that, but they've got their stuff. With my self, coming through with the Masters degree, I just get, I sort of ride a wa ve. I'm able to make contact with the hospitals, university hospitals, because of the degree. I qualify as a Chaplin automatically. And it's really a difficult th ing to get into the chaplaincy because you got to have so many things, and th at's what the education is (E1 p.5). Elder 1 highlighted that many Indigenous Elders and healers, while not possessing Western education, are gifted, skilled, and knowledgeab le in their own belief systems and healing methods, referring to this as a Masters in Li fe and Indigenous Knowle dge. However, without the stamp of approval from a Western instituti on, Indigenous Elders and healers are often greeted with scepticism by Western hea lthcare professionals and organizations: But anyways, everywhere I've went, th is is how it's been and I've been challenged. But I'm not afraid, like I'm not afraid one iota to be evaluated, my work, because I know why I'm there, and it has nothing to do with money, Sure money is nice, but the things that have happened to me in my life that has shown me why I need to do this work, a nd it has nothing to do with money. So my work quality, it doesn't come from me. That's what I acknowledge. And I think that's where a lot of Western practit ioners struggle, becau se a lot of them become, the ego can take over (TH5 p.17). In reflecting on her experiences with having demands placed on her to have her work evaluated, Traditional Healer 5 raised the poi nt that many Indigenous Elders and healers 175 perceive their abilities as being gi fted to them by a higher power, which is in stark contrast to the idea that skills can be developed and acqui red through formalized educational settings. In comparison to formalized academic study and skill development, Elder 3 reflected on one Indigenous concept that describes a process th at many Indigenous Elders and healers partake in, in terms of acquiring knowledge and skills, which is commonly referred to as assembling one's medicine bundle. As was discussed in th e results section, a me dicine bundle is often made up of real life objects that are of pe rsonal significance or power (such as an eagle feather, drum), and figurative gifts, skills, cultural teachings, and knowledge that the individual possesses, has accumulated, or receive d from other teachers or the Creator. Elder 3 described how the gifts that are endowed in one's medicine bundle are to be shared for healing with others in need: We come through creation, through our me dicine bundles. And in our medicine bundles we are given gifts, what to use on our trail. And on our trail we may have a disease of something. So the spir it says well I gave you that medicine, use that medicine. But share it. Share it with the world. Share it with people. Teach people (E3 p.10). Ellerby (2005) discussed in de tail some of the processes by which Indigenous Elders acquire knowledge and skills, with the learning journe y often beginning in adolescence and lasting throughout one's lifetime (as opposed to an eight year trajectory for graduate level degrees). With respect to the credential recognition and ab ilities of a healer, or an Indigenous Elder or healer who is in good standing, Ellerby stated that this tends to be provided by the individual's community, as opposed to educati onal degrees that are conferred by universities. However, differences in types of knowledge a nd training are of central importance when 176 discussing the issue of remuneration. Indigenous Elders and healers are often not equally remunerated with Western healthcare profe ssionals as Traditional Teacher 5 noted: Another thing is the value of the healers. Right now that's one of the things that I've really made a statement with, especia lly in the (name of place). In this one community they would bring in a psychol ogist and they were paying her $800 a day to come in. She saw four people in one week [...] the government is willing to pay that kind of money to se nd psychologists into these communities that the people aren't using, but when it comes to healers, they don't see the same value, and I'm booked [...] the government, their policies about health, don't see the same values for healers as for psychologists or doctors (TH5 p.16). A multitude of issues and points of discussi on stem from differences in the knowledge acquisition and training of Indige nous and Western professionals, and if these systems are to be integrated and practiced t ogether successfully, shared unde rstandings and the acceptance of the different means by which healing/treatm ent abilities are acquired will have to be established and reflecte d in governmental and organizational policies. Unless the various challenges and issues outlined above are no t collaboratively discussed and reviewed, a number of different th eoretical and practical problems will likely develop when attempting to integrate Indige nous and Western appro aches. In the following section I review some of the recommendations put forward by the Elders to address some of these challenges. Next steps or action items wh ich the Elders identified as being important for proceeding with integrat ion are also reviewed. 177 Recommendations from the Elders Elder 1 and Witness 2 identified the need for a framework of Indigenous knowledge to be strengthened. Witness 2 spoke throughout he r interview about the need to re-aggregate Indigenous knowledge, and stated that the only wa y Indigenous peoples will be able to make informed choices about the possibility of integr ated practice is to be informed about their own health and healing systems. When Elder 1 was asked about how respect and acceptance of Indigenous methods of healing will take place, he cited the need for an established base of knowledge, which he believes many people, in cluding students and Elders, are working to build and strengthen today: You students who are gathering this info rmation are the ones that are going to do this framework that houses Abor iginal healing practices and you will construct this in a way that it will become accepted practicing medicine [... ] you'll be there and you'll have this framework. You will write for grants, you will write for grants and research more and in that researching you will have Elders come in there and they will do their, and they will... And you will have created the space for them, and our knowledge will be respected. Our knowledge will be there because you will have written in your framework, and your pillars of knowledge is what you ha ve learned from this, and it will be housed in Western medical practices (E1 p.19) Elder 1 cited ongoing research as a means to strengthen and build this framework for knowledge. With an increased research lens and focus on Indigenous approaches to health and healing, the perspectives and experiences of our Indigenous Elde rs and healers will continue to be showcased as powerful and influential sources of knowledge. Elder 1's 178 suggestion for continued research efforts is re lated to a second recommendation, which is the empirical evaluation of Indigenous a nd Western theories and practices. Witness 2 and Traditional Healer 5 sh ared their belief and support for having both Indigenous and Western theories, practices, and practit ioners evaluated. Tr aditional Healer 5 shared that she often encourages the communities that she is working in to evaluate her work to ensure that she is the appropriate healer for their community. However, she recounted an experience in which a health director requested that only her work be evaluated, despite the presence of several other Western healthcare practitioners working in the same space as Traditional Healer 5: The health director, she said to me well you know what, maybe we should evaluate the program. Maybe we should evaluate how effective your work is [...] And I said to her, yeah, that's a gr eat idea, I want you to do this, but I also want you to see how effective your do ctors are and your psychologists are (TH5 p.17). The assumption that Western interventions are effective is an example of the differential treatment, sometimes prejudicial treatment, which Indigenous Elders and healers often encounter. Given low service utilization rates and poor perceptions of Western psychotherapy by many Indigenous peoples (e.g. , Harris, Edlund, & Larson, 2005; Price & McNeill, 1992), it is a reasonabl e expectation that both Indige nous and Western practitioners would have their work evaluated, as opposed to assuming that one approach to healing is more effective than the other. The review of the literature provided a su mmary of problematic issues related to empirically evaluating Indigenous methods, which include the r ecording and disclosure of 179 sacred knowledge and practices, identifying the variables which will determine efficacy, and the use of a Western informed research paradi gm. However, Witness 2 conceptualized some of the reluctance expressed by Indigenous individu als to evaluate Indigenous approaches as self-racism in stating: I think that we're terrified of finding out that we're infe rior, that's what I think that is, I think it's a bunc h of self-racism. These pe ople that are saying that think they are inferior and so they do n't want Western standards applied to them. I think it's even more than th at for me though. I don't want Western standards applied to it because I think th ey're way too low. I think we need a whole new set of standards and a whole new way of looking at things because their medicine is inadequa te, it can't create a hea lthy society. They've proven that (W2 p.19). The comments from Witness 2 and Traditional T eacher 5 are in contra st to much of the writing in the area of evaluating Indigenous appro aches to healing. However, if integration is to occur between Indigenous and Western approaches , it is likely that some formal practices for evaluation will have to be designed a nd employed. Witness 2's assertion that new measurement standards are required is a f itting and well-timed suggestion, and several Indigenous researchers have begun to articula te what an Indigenous informed research paradigm may look like in practice (e.g. Wilson, 2001; Weber-Pillw ax, 1999). A study conducted by Goudreau, Weber-Pillwaw, Cote-M eek, Madill, and Wilson (2008) illustrated how Indigenous informed research methods may be successfully used to examine the therapeutic benefits of I ndigenous cultural practices. 180 A third recommendation put forward by four of the five Elders is an increase in education and training programs for Western healthcare practitioners. This was most commonly suggested when the Elders were queried about how Indigenous methods will come to be regarded as legitimate and valid approaches to healing. In discussing his support for integrated practice, Traditional Teacher 4 commented, \"So let's do it, let's do it together. And if you need to have us come in and do a workshop or a {inaudible }, we'll be glad to do it. So we make ourselves available (TT4 p.28) . While some researchers and academics have expressed concerns related to the disclosure of traditional and sacred knowledge, the majority of the Elders in this stud y were adamant supporters of sharing knowledge about their practices and educating Wester n practitioners. The findings fr om Crowe-Salazar (2007) and Maar, Erskine, McGregor, Larose, Sutherland, Graham, et al. (2009) also demonstrated a willingness on behalf of Western professionals to learn more about Indigenous healing methods. The willingness of both Indigenous and Western practitione rs to provide and receive education is a promising finding for the development of successful collaborative working relationships in the future. With respect to formalized education, Trad itional Healer 5 expressed her belief that Indigenous specific approaches to health a nd healing need to be implemented at an institutional level: I really think that training or the edu cation of Western practitioners that's going to work with Indigenous people, or even if they're going to work in a centre where there's a more holistic approach, they need to be educated in what that means because although we might think we know what it means, how do you 181 work with it? How do you work with th at spiritual part, how do you work the mental, physical, emotional, how does all of that work together? (TH5 p.15) Elder 1 also put forward the notion of deve loping training and curriculum which would see Western healthcare professiona ls leaving the academy and studying alongside Indigenous healers and Elders in diverse se ttings to gain an appreciati on of their practice and methods. While some researchers (e.g. Stewart, 2007b; Vi cary & Bishop, 2005) have suggested that training in Indigenous specific c onceptualizations and approaches to healing is needed, very few programs currently exist which offer this ty pe of education and skill development. This type of course or curriculum development and its evaluation represents a rich and vital area for future research and program development. One final point of discussion which was ra ised by both Witness 2 and Elder 3 is the idea of aggregating and sharing all knowledge systems and appro aches to healing of peoples worldwide, not just Indigenous and Western systems. With incr easing rates of certain health epidemics (HIV/AIDS, cancers, diabetes, etcetera), both of these Elders expressed their belief that it will only be through a unification of diverse approaches to healing that we will be able to meeting the healing needs of people at a global level: What is walking to the good life? What does that mean and how does everybody get on board? And how are we goi ng to make this map, if you will, so that everybody is headi ng in the same direction and we're going away from the deadly direction that we're travelli ng in and toward a better direction? That's going to take more than Aborig inal thinking and more than Western thinking, that's going to take a lot of pe ople thinking about it and facing that we are right this moment inadequate. Ye ah? And it's not that it's Western 182 methodologies or Aboriginal methodologies , it's that the knowledge base is inadequate. Once we start aggregatin g Aboriginal knowledge and Chinese knowledge and all these other knowledges, then we can figure it out. Now we may not have that much time, but we need to at least advocate in that direction (W2 p.20). While Western mental health workers are current ly trained to practice cultural competence when working with people of various cultura l backgrounds, Witness 2 and Elder 3 asserted that all current th eories and practices are inadequate as diverse phys ical and mental health problems continue to persist. Assumptions re garding the superiority and inferiority of knowledge systems and its practitioners must be abandoned, and it will take a unified effort to determine current best and promising practi ces for health problems. Energy and resources must be allocated to building a theoretical and practical framework of knowledge, revising methods for evaluation, and sharing informa tion about each others' belief systems and practices. Summary of Chapter Five In Chapter Five I presented th e within participant results and analyses as related to the overarching research question of this study. Results indicated that all five Elders conceived of the possibility of integrating Indigenous and Western health a nd healing approaches together. Each Elder had varying levels of experience with integrated practice, which included both successful and poor experiences. The rationale and conceptual underpinnings for integrated efforts, as identified by th e Elders, was reviewed. All five Elders also identified current challenges and issues that need to be addressed prior to moving forward with the implementation of integrated practice. Recommendations for how to proceed at this 183 point in time were provided, which included building a framework for knowledge, evaluating Indigenous and Western theori es and practices, and increa sing education and training programs for Western healthcare professionals . The final chapter contains my concluding statements, implications, and recommendations for future research. 184 Chapter Six: Concluding Statements and Implications In this chapter I present my concluding statements, which include a summary of the study, limitations of the study, implications of th e study, future directions for research, and a final concluding reflection. Summary What are Indigenous Elders perspectives on the integration of Indigenous and Western healing paradigms, and what, if any, are their experien ces of working in integrated contexts? I have attempted to answer this research question by employing a qualitative research paradigm and conducting a narrative inquiry, as the conceptual frameworks informing this study are Indigenous ways of knowing and social constructionism. I interviewed five Indigenous Elde rs about their understandings of the growing trend to merge Indigenous and Western approaches to mental health together , and documented their personal stories and experiences with inte grated practice. A narrative anal ysis of the interviews, which included the use of a story map as a research tool, yielded within and across participant results. While participants reported diverse pe rspectives and experien ces with integrated practice, all five Elders iden tified a potential for Indigenous and Western approaches to be used successfully together in the future. The rationale for integrati ng these paradigms of health included the role of I ndigenous culture as a determinan t of health for many Indigenous people, and the need for spiritual practic e in healing endeavours. The conceptual underpinnings of integrated practice included re cognition of the streng ths and weaknesses of each approach, acceptance of each approach as va lid and legitimate, and the establishment of respectful working relationshi ps between Indigenous and Western practitioners. All five Elders identified a diverse number of experien ces and expressions of integrated practice, 185 including the use of Indigenous healing met hods in Western spaces; collaborations or referrals between practit ioners; integrated mental health programming; and organizations that employ an integrated approach to healthcare . While the Elders expressed some support for the idea of integrated practice, they all identi fied several issues or areas of concern that require attention prior to advancement within the integrated healing movement. Issues that were discussed included the ro le of historical relationships between Indigenous peoples and Canadian society, differences in epistemology and treatment approach, and differences in knowledge acquisition and training for Indigeno us and Western practitioners. The Elders provided recommendations for next steps, which included the need to re-amalgamate Indigenous knowledge and strengthen Indige nous knowledge frameworks, the design and implementation of evaluation methods for bot h Indigenous and Western approaches, and increases in educational programming for We stern trained healthcare professionals. The narratives shared by the Elders in this study are a significant contribution to research and healthcare communities, as their personal accounts represent authentic experiences of knowledge keepers and Indigenous healers who have years of experience working in the healthcare fields. Limitations of the Study The purpose of this research was not to cr eate quantifiable or obj ective truths about perspectives and experiences with integrated healthcare. Rather, the use of a qualitative research paradigm facilitated a concentrat ed exploration and st udy of the notion of Indigenous and Western integrati on as understood by five Indige nous Elders. My goal was to obtain the personal narratives of these Elders so as to gain greater insight and a depth of understanding about the topic at hand. As such, the perspectives and experiences reported by 186 the Elders in this study should not be gene ralized to other Indigenous Elders. As was delineated in the results and di scussion sections, the five Elde rs reported a divergence of opinion with respect to integrat ed healthcare, suggesting that an overarching consensus does not exist at this point in time and further study exploring the narratives of Indigenous Elders is needed. While the five Elders in this study re presented diverse Indigenous Nations and peoples, their knowledge and beli ef systems represented a small sample of the 600 First Nations currently in Canada. Furthermore, all five Elders were of First Nations background, and the perspectives of M\u00e9tis and Inuit Elders were not incl uded in this study. While the five Elders in this study have worked in both urba n and rural environments , most of the Elders currently work in urban centres providing te aching and conducting healing work. One might anticipate that the narratives of Elders work ing in predominantly rural environments would differ significantly from the opinions expr essed by the Elders in this study. A final limitation to the study was the potenti al for researcher bias. As noted in Chapter 1, the conceptual underpinnings of th is study were Indigenous ways of knowing and social constructionism. These frameworks represent my personal assumptions of how knowledge is generated and shared. While I acknowledge my activ e role in the co- construction of knowledge and the implied meaning of the narratives reported in this study, I employed various research protocols and precauti ons to guard against researcher bias, which included the use of multiple cultural informan ts, validity checking with participants, and a triangulation of research methods (researcher jo urnal, interview data, participant feedback). 187 Implications of the Study There are several implications of the fi ndings from this study. One of the main implications is that ongoing dialogue and resear ch related to examining the ways in which Indigenous and Western approach es may be blended together are needed and warranted at this time. Theories of how Indigenous and West ern methods may be used together are still being formulated, and the exact levels or expressions of inte grated healthcare are still evolving in practice. However, th e findings also indicated that th e Elders believe we are still in the very early formative stages of integr ated healthcare, and several of the Elders expressed reservations about moving forward, in terms of program development, without first addressing foundational elements and areas of concern related to integrated practice. This would entail, for example, the acqui sition of funding for purposes of Indigenous knowledge reclamation, which would include fu nding for gatherings of Indigenous Elders and healers and the development of dissemi nation protocols and educational programming, that would facilitate the wide spread distribution of Indigenous knowledge related to health and healing among Indigenous individuals and communities. Another critical implicati on of the study is that Indigenous Elders and healers, Western healthcare professionals, and governme ntal bodies for healthcare, must meet to discuss the various challenges rela ted to integration (differences in epistemologies, treatment approaches and interventions, acceptable standa rds of practice, professional standards and remuneration) and develop stra tegies and protocols which w ould see changes in current healthcare policy that would allow for successful integrative work to occur. For instance, current policies related to the prohibition of Indigenous healing methods in many Western healthcare settings remains a large obstacle to integrated work and healing for many 188 Indigenous peoples. Efforts in th is area are beginning to occur, as can be seen with the Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy in On tario, but it is clear th at ongoing discussions and meetings of these representatives must c ontinue to occur at this point in time. A third implication of this study is rela ted to certain Elde rs' desire for the development of evaluation methods to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and beneficial aspects of both Indigenous and Western approach es to health and healing. Two of the five Elders expressed strong support for the need to evaluate both Indigenous and Western methods. As was discussed in the review of the literature, Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, scholars, and pract itioners have expressed conc erns about the evaluation of Indigenous healing practices. While some of these reservations stem from concerns related to the use of a Western research paradigm and the documenta tion of traditional knowledge, some researchers have begun to empirically e xplore Indigenous heali ng methods through the use of Indigenous research methodologies (see G oudreau et al, 2008). It is clear that both Indigenous and Western health systems and pr actitioners share the same goal of delivering effective and non-harmful treatment or healing interventions. Resear ch is in fact needed that examines how integrated hea lthcare systems and programs are currently operating, and what beneficial health outcomes are being achieved by individuals accessing these services. The task going forward will be the use, perhaps development of, evaluation methods that effectively assess Indigenous, Western, a nd integrated methods for healing. Another key finding from this study was the ge neral felt experience of all five Elders that Indigenous approaches and practices of health are viewed as illegitimate or disregarded by the Western healthcare system and the majority of its practitioners. This was often interpreted as a sign of disrespe ct by many of the participants. As was described in the results 189 and discussion sections, respectf ul relationships was identified as a foundational element for successful collaborative work. Lack of understandi ng or respect for an approach to healthcare was oftentimes attributed to a lack of education, and several of the Elders in this study called for an increase in educational programming for Western trained healthcare professionals. One Elder suggested the development of a training component which would see Western healthcare professionals traini ng alongside Indigenous healers in their working and practice environments. A second Elder identified the use of Indigenous Elders and healers as instructors in graduate level training programs and the use of workshops or seminars to inform currently practicing professionals about Indigenous approaches. As was discussed in the discussion section, both Western healthcar e professionals and I ndigenous Elders and healers have expressed a desire for more opportu nities to discuss Indigenous approaches to health and healing, a positive finding which suppor ts the potential for collaborative practice. While some scholars and practitioners have expr essed concerns related to the disclosure of traditional knowledge, several of the Elders in this study expressed enthusiasm for open discussions and a demystifying of Indigenous approaches for non-Indigenous professionals. The implications of these findings would see th e development of new educational curriculum and programming for Western trained health care professionals, and opportunities for currently practicing professionals to regularly receive additional training or consultation with Indigenous Elders or healers about Indigenous health and healing. In summary, the implications of the fi ndings from this study include a need for ongoing discussions between Indigenous, Wester n, and governmental parties to delineate potential theories and practices of integrat ed healthcare. Changes in current policy and educational programming are needed, as well as the identification of appropriate evaluation 190 methods that accurately assess therapeutic effec tiveness while also being culturally informed. Finessed channels of comm unication between Indigenous and Western healthcare practitioners are needed to strengthen collabo rative and respectful working relationships. Recommendations for Future Research A primary recommendation for future resear ch would be to replicate the study with Indigenous Elders of diverse backgrounds thro ughout Canada, including those working in both rural and urban contexts. While indivi dual interviews provided for depth and thoroughness, conducting focus groups with a collect ive of Elders would also yield a wealth of knowledge and understanding about the topic. In addition to Indi genous Elders, other Indigenous practitioners and h ealth organization administrato rs are additional potential participants with knowledge related to integrated healthcare approaches. Research that examines the strengths, wea knesses, and beneficial health aspects of current integrated programming are needed. While there is a growing number of examples of integrated programming in the literature (e.g. Shore, Shore, & Manson, 2009), these studies often fail to examine the st rengths and challenges which the individual Indigenous and Western practitioners encounter when form ing relationships, and how challenges are addressed. Additionally, virtually no data exists which has documented changes in health outcomes or client experiences in receiving integrated healthcare interventions. This area represents a fertile area for future research as integrated programming continues to be developed. And finally, the development of new re search methodologies and educational programming related to Indigenous healing were identified as action items by the participants in this study. Given the newne ss and innovative practices of in tegrated healthcare at this 191 time, alterations in approaches to research and training will also likely develop and require evaluation as time progresses. Concluding Reflection My intentions with this thesis have been to documen t the voices of Indigenous Elders on the idea of Indigenous and Western therapeu tic integration. My motivation for selecting this topic was that as a mental health clinician in training, wo rking in the area of Indigenous mental health and integrated care, I was su rprised that the wisdom and counsel of our knowledge keepers has been absent in mu ch of the documented discussions around integrating health paradigms to date. The Elders in this study supported the notion of integrated healthcare, but also identified severa l key concerns that must first be addressed so that decisions are not made hastily or without a solid and respectful foundation in place. All five Elders spoke openly and honestly about their perspectives and experiences, and demonstrated an enthusiasm for the work that is being done to addre ss the healing needs in many Indigenous communities today. One teaching that I received from an Elder many years ago is that in order to move forward we must look back to see where we have come from, and to use the knowledge of our mentors in informing our choices. As a mental health practitioner, and a M\u00e9tis woma n, I believe that it is crucia l that the powerful healing strengths that currently exist in Indigenous communities be acce ssed and utilized in transforming current mental health practices to enhance the health and well-being of our people today. 192 References Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy.

I am from the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario a nd am currently a graduate student in Counselling Psychology at OISE - University of Toronto. I am interested in exploring Indigenous Elders' persp ectives on the use of Indigenous and Western healing approaches together. To participate in my project you must: 1) Be identified as an Elder by your community or workplace If you might be interested, please contact me by phone or email. Miigwetch - Thank you very much! 416-889-6918 Email: t.beaulieu@utoronto.ca B Telephone Script for Potential Participants Hello ____: My name is Teresa Beaulieu and I am Masters level graduate student in the department of Adult Education and Counselling Psychology at OISE - University of Toronto. My reason for contacting you today is to i nquire about your potential partic ipation in a research study entitled \"Exploring Indigenous and Western th erapeutic integration: Perspectives and experiences of Indigenous Elders.\" The purpose of this research project is to gain an in-depth understanding of the ways Indigenous and Western mental he alth and healing practices can complement one another in order to successfully meet th e healing needs of Native peoples today. An additional focus of the research is to explore the successes and challenges faced by Indigenous Elders who have worked in integrated (Indigenous and Western) healing contexts or mental health service agencies. You are being invited to participate because you are a community identified Indigenous Elder. If you agree to voluntarily participate in this research, your participation will include two 1-2 hour audio-taped intervie ws that will take place in your community workplace. The total time commitment is approximately 2-4 hours, and participation in this study should not cause you any inconvenience other than the interview time. Your participation in this research must be completely voluntary. If you do decide to participate, you may withdraw at any time, or re fuse to answer certain questions without any consequences or any explanation. In the even t that you withdraw from this study, your audio- taped interview and all accompanying notes wi ll be destroyed. Your confidentiality, including your name and the information you shar e, is also assured. This project has also received ethical approval from the University of Toronto. I will leave my phone number ( 416-889-6918) and email address ( t.beaulieu@utorotno.ca ) with you so that you can contact me if you have a ny additional questions or are interested in participating. Many thanks for your time and consideration 206 Appendix C Participant Consent Form Exploring Indigenous and Western therapeutic integration: Perspectives and experiences of Indigenous Elders You are being invited to participate in a st udy entitled \"Exploring Indigenous and Western therapeutic integration: Persp ectives and experiences of Indi genous Elders\" that is being conducted by Teresa Beaulieu. Teresa Beaulieu is a Masters leve l graduate student in the department of Adult Education and Counselling Psychology at OISE - University of Toronto. This research project is being carried out in partial fulfillment for Ms. Beau lieu's Masters level degree. Should you have any concerns about the research, you may at any time contact Dr. Suzanne L. Stewart (supervisor) at (416)-978-0723 or Teresa Beaulieu at (416) 889-6918 or by email at t.beaulieu@utoronto.ca The purpose of this research project is to gain an in-depth understanding of the ways Indigenous and Western mental he alth and healing practices can complement one another in order to successfully meet th e healing needs of Native peoples today. An additional focus of the research is to explore the successes and challenges faced by Indigenous Elders who have worked in integrated (Indigenous and Western) healing contexts or mental health service agencies. Research of this type is impor tant because research has demons trated that there is an under use of mental health services by Indigenous peoples due to cultural differences, and the integration of Indigenous and Western paradi gms and approaches to healing has been suggested as a viable alternative. However, th ere is currently a lack of empirical research related to the successes and chal lenges of integrating Indigenous and Western approaches to healing. The results of this study will therefor e contribute new inform ation to the research literature on Indigenous health and well-being, and will inform the development of teaching materials for community counsellors, support wo rkers, psychologists, and other community members and health professionals who are suppor ting Indigenous peoples in mental health and healing. You are being invited to participate because you are a community identified Indigenous Elder. If you agree to voluntarily participate in this research, your participation will include two 1-2 hour audio-taped interv iews that will take place in a setting (e.g. home, workplace, etcetera) of your choice. The total time commitment is approximately 2-4 hours, and participation in this study should not cause you any inconvenience other than the interview time. 207 There are no known or anticipat ed risks to you through particip ating in this research. You will be discussing general everyday work-re lated topics related to your professional knowledge and work experience, and the interv iew will not breech conf identiality regarding particular topics or clients with whom you work. The potential benefits of your pa rticipation in this research in clude clarification of your own views of cultural mental health and healing in your work. Poten tial benefits to society include informing education and policy about promisi ng mental health prac tices for Indigenous peoples in Canada, and informing academic lite rature about Indigenous and Western mental health relations. Your participation in this research must be completely voluntary. If you do decide to participate, you may withdraw at any time, or re fuse to answer certain questions without any consequences or any explanation. In the even t that you withdraw from this study, your audio- taped interview and all accompanyi ng notes will be destroyed. As a way to show respect and thank you for your participation, you will be presented with a medicine bundle (sage, sweetgrass, cedar, and tobacco) at the time of the interview. Should you decide to withdraw from the study at any time, the honorarium is yours to keep. To preserve your confidentiality, your name will not appear on any of the data, as a code will be assigned to replace your name on the interv iew audio tapes, on the interview transcripts, and in all notes. Alternatively, you may choose to select a pseudonym of your choice in place of your name that will be used in the rese arch study and all re search documents (e.g. interview transcripts; final research reports). The key for all coded names will be kept separately from the interview data. Signed consent letters will also be stored separately from any data. You may also choose to revoke your right to confidentiality and use personal identifiers in both the interview transcript a nd final research report. Please note, however, that you are free at any time throughout the rese arch process to exercise your right to confidentiality and the use of a code or a pseudonym. Your confidentiality will be protected by stor ing interview audiotapes and the transcribed data in a locked filing cabinet. Only the rese archer will have access to the data. The audio- tapes from your interview, the transcribed data, and any notes taken during the interview will be destroyed after five years. It is anticipated that the resu lts of this study will be shar ed with you and others in the following ways: directly to participants by ha nd delivery of results in a research report, through published articles in sc holarly journals, in policy re ports to Native and non-Native governments and health organizations, a nd at scholarly conferences/meetings. In addition to being able to contact the rese archer and her supervisor, you may verify the ethical approval of this study, or raise any c oncerns you might have, by contacting the Office of Research Ethics, 416-946-3273 or ethics.review@utoronto.ca .
