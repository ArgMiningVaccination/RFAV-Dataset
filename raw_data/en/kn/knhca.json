About the event... We'll use the tools of shamanic reiki, meditation, and intention to create a grounding and transformative healing experience that will leave you feeling more connected to your most intimate parts. This ceremony will allow you to release emotional and energetic imprints from your womb & etheric womb space (suitable also for women who have had hysterectomies). Most women unknowingly harbour & host energies within our womb space, even from past lives and from our maternal DNA lineage ancestry. Our cellular memory also links us to our Mother Ancestors; to their trauma, pain, and suffering, but also to their strength, courage, resourcefulness and wisdom. Similar to how your heart can have a wall of protective energy around it, your womb can have a wall of protective energy around her. The womb is a portal, and refreshing the energy in that space promotes staying grounded in love. Having your womb as an inner guide helps promote powerful purification & nurtures sovereignty and reminds you of the sacred medicine you hold within. We work with the womb so old patterns can be released and future generations are free to create a different story. The energy of the womb space governs emotions, creativity, sensitivity, sexuality, intimacy, and self-expression. Spiritually, connecting to your womb opens you to the qualities she embodies. These qualities are as unique as each womb holder, and opening to the feelings in your womb space invites them to be embodied throughout your whole being. Working with this energy center can transform negative emotions, experiences and toxic relationships into a rejuvenated space for new beginnings. Womb-yn, we honor your empowerment. For Your highest good. And for the greatest good of All. You will leave feeling a deep connection to yourself and your lineage purified, nurtured, and connected in your sacral chakra/womb center the healing power of being witnessed in sisterhood empowered, seen and loved Required Materials Clothing that is comfortable and embodies your inner goddess (adornments, colors, jewelry, scarves, and headpieces are encouraged!)
