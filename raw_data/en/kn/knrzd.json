This individual CHNA report utilizes relevant health data and stakeholder input to iden tify significant community health needs in Washington and Ramsey Counties in Minnesota and St. Croix County in Wisconsin, the defined study area for Lakeview Hospital. Data from the study areas of the other hospitals (Dakota, Hennepin and Scott Counties in Minnesota and Polk County in Wisconsin) are included in some sections fo r comparison purposes. The CHNA Team, consisting of leadership from HealthPartners and its hospitals, met with staff from Community Hospital Consulting on August 24, 2015 to review the research findings and prioritize the community health needs. Four significant community health needs were identified by assessing the prevalence of the issues identified fr om the health data findings combined with the frequency and severity of mentions in community input. The CHNA Team participated in a roundtable discussion to rank the community health needs based on three characteristics: size and prevalence of the issue, effectiveness of interventions and the hospital's capacity to address the need. Once this prioritiz ation process was complete, the health system and hospital leadership discussed the results and decided to address all of the prioritized needs in various capacities through hospital specific implementation plans. HealthPartners and hospital leadership developed the following principle to guide this work: Through collaboration, engagement and partnership with our communities we will addr ess the following priorities with a specific focus on health equity in special populations. The final list of prioritized needs, in descending order, is listed below: 1. Mental and Behavioral Health 2. Access and Affordability 3. Chronic Disease and Illness Prevention 4. Equitable Care Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 4Priority #1: Mental and Behavioral Health Health data findings suggest that the Twin Cities have higher rates of psychiatric hospital admissions than Minnesota. Furthermore, data indicates that counties in the hospital's study area have varying ratios of mental health providers to residents. Ramsey County - 298:1 St. Croix County - 1,011:1 Washington County - 544:1 Minnesota - 529:1 Wisconsin - 632:1 Ramsey Coun ty identified mental health, mental disorders, and behavioral health as a top priority in the Ramsey County Community Health Improvement Plan 20142018 . Findings from this report also indicate that only two of the five hospitals in Ramsey County provide inpatient mental health services. Ramsey County also falls short of the r ecommended 250 beds for its 500,000 population by nearly 100 beds. Finally, Ramsey County Public Health estimates that approximately 21% of children in the county suffer from mental disorders with at least some functional impairment at home, school and with peers. According to the Minnesota Student Survey (2013), acr oss all Minnesota counties in the study area and in the state, 9th grade females reported higher rates of being harassed or bullied once or twice for their weight or physical appearance as compared to males. Additionally, a higher percentage of female 9th graders, compared to male 9th graders, report ha ving a longterm mental health, behavioral health or emotional problem. Washington County identified behavioral health problems among children and adults due to substance abuse and mental illness as a health need in the Washington County Community Health Improvement Plan 2014 . As a part of the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessmen t and Improvement Plan 20142016 , the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Survey identified alcohol and other substance use and addictions as a top health priority. Additional findings from this study indicate that 12.6% of students have considered attempting suicide in the last six months, 43.2% of high school s tudents agreed that harassment and bullying is a problem at their school and excessive alcohol consumption is one of Wisconsin's largest public health issues. The Healthiest Wisconsin 2020: Everyone Living Better, Longer Health Focus Areas include mental health and unhealthy alcohol and drug use. Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 5Priority #1: Mental and Behavioral Health Continued Participants in the community conversations conducted by Lakeview Hospital identified access to mental health services, as well as chemical and substance abuse issues as concerns in the study area. This includes the need to decrease stigma associated with mental health problems; to close the gap in access to services; to implemen t preventative education; and to connect the \"need\" with the \"help.\" Participants also discussed the chemical and substance abuse issues in the community. Concerns include the abuse of prescription medications; the lack of continuing alcohol and tobacco education; the increase in drug use among high school students; the problem with marijuana's incr easing acceptance; and the need to educate adults and guardians on new forms of common substances. In 2012, 76 people in Washington County, 261 people in Ramsey County, and 36 people in St. Croix County were injured in alcoholrelated motor vehicle crashes. According to the Minnesota Student Survey (2013), o verall, a higher percentage of female 9th grade students (between 10% and 14%), compared to male 9th grade students (between 8% and 11%), reported living with someone who drinks too much alcohol. In 2011, 28% of St. Croix County residents responding to the survey participated in binge drinking in the las t 30 days before the survey, as compared to 23% of Wisconsin. In St. Croix, 29% of high school students reported having consumed alcohol during the last 30 days. In addition, 16.2% of St. Croix high school students reported binge drinking during the past 30 days before the survey. Acc ording to the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 , the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Survey indicates that 21.3% of high school students reported having tried marijuana. Priority #2: Access and Affordability While Washington County's median household income is over $81,000, St. Croix County's median household income is much lower at $69,641, and Ramsey County's median household income is even lower at $56,293 (2013). In addition, between 6% and 23% of children under age 18 in the hospital's study area are living in po verty (2013). Each county's unemployment rate has decreased since 2012, while Washington County's unemployment rate is still slightly higher than Minnesota's rate (2014). 9.5% of residents under age 65 in Minnesota and 10.6% of residents under age 65 in Wisconsin do not have health insurance (2013). This compares to 11.8% in Ramsey Coun ty, 7% in St. Croix County and 6.3% in Washington County. Ramsey County identified access to health services as a top health priority in the Ramsey County Community Health Improvement Plan 20142018 . Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 6Priority #2: Access and Affordability Continued The Healthiest Wisconsin 2020: Everyone Living Better, Longer Infrastructure Focus Areas include: access to quality health services; collaborative partnerships for community health improvement; equitable, adequate, stable public health funding; public health capacity and quality; tobacco use and systems to manage and share health information and knowledge. As a part of the St. Croix Coun ty Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 , the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Survey identified access to primary and preventive services as a top health priority. Parents who participated in the Family Community Survey, as a part of the PowerUp initiative in St. Croix and Wa shington Counties, indicated that coupons/price discounts would help PowerUp their families. Participants in the community conversations conducted by Lakeview Hospital identified creating connections as a significant need in the community. Connecting people to services and to each other was a recurring theme, and it was mentioned that Lakeview Hospital can be in fluential by continuing to connect patients to available services. Improving access to health care for populations with limited services and increasing the proportion of residents who have access to health coverage were also mentioned by participants as important initiatives in the community. Priority #3: Chronic Disease and Illness Prevention Cancer and heart disease are the first and second leading causes of death in Ramsey, St. Croix, and Washington Counties, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin (20092013). St. Croix County has increasing diabetes, cirrhosis, and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality rates, while Ramsey County has increasing unintentional injury, cirrhosis and chr onic lower respiratory disease mortality rates. Ramsey County also has the highest rates of stroke mortality and cancer mortality in the study area. Finally, Washington County has a higher incidence of breast cancer in females and colorectal cancer in all gender groups compared to other counties in the study area and Minnesot a. Obesity and diabetes are also concerns in the study area counties and across the state. More than 25% of residents in each of the counties in the hospital's study area, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin, are obese (2012). Additionally, over onethird of the adult population in Washington County (36.3%), as we ll as Minnesota (37.0%) and Wisconsin (36.5%), are overweight. St. Croix has the highest rate of obesity compared to other counties in the study area, but is lower than Wisconsin's rate. St. Croix County also has a higher rate of diabetes mortality compared to other counties in the s tudy area, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin. Ramsey County identified nutrition, weight and active living as a top health priority in the Ramsey County Community Health Improvement Plan 20142018 . Washington County identified obesity and chronic diseases as two of its top three health priorities in the Washington Coun ty Community Health Improvement Plan 2014 . Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 7Priority #3: Chronic Disease and Illness Prevention Continued The Healthiest Wisconsin 2020: Everyone Living Better, Longer Health Focus Areas also include: chronic disease prevention and management; communicable disease prevention and control; physical activity; healthy growth and development; adequate, appropriate, and safe food and nutrition; and tobacco use and exposure. St. Croix County identified healthy foods and physical activity as tw o of its top three health priorities in the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 . Community input findings also indicate that increased access to active living, access to healthy food options and promotion of healthy eating are needs in the community. Finally, 82% of respondents in the Transform Wisconsin Public Opinion Poll indicated that childhood obesity is a serious problem in Wisconsin. Parents who participated in the Family Community Survey, as a part of the PowerUp initiative, indicated that physical activity during the school day, access to free/low cost places to be physically active, ph ysical education in schools, and better food and beverage options at community events would help PowerUp their families. According to the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 , the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Survey indicates that 25.6% of students reported watching television 3 or more hour s per day on an average school day. Overall, in each county and the state, male 11th grade students compared to female 11th grade students were physically active for 60 minutes or more on a greater number of days (Minnesota Student Survey, 2013, 47 days compared to 03 da ys). In St. Croix, 79.6% of residents reported consuming insufficient fruit and vegetable intake in 2012, as compared to the Wisconsin average of 77.2%. Overall, in each county in the study area and Minnesota, a slightly higher percentage of male 11th grade students, compared to female 11th grade students, drank at leas t one pop or soda during the day prior to taking the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey. Participants in the community conversations conducted by Lakeview Hospital identified nutrition and physical activity as needs in the community. This includes a lack of health literacy regarding wellness; lack of access to nutrientdense f oods due to food inequity in the area, particularly for special populations; lack of resources promoting physical activity; and a need for an enhanced focus on school wellness. Gonorrhea rates are increasing in Ramsey County, as well as Minnesota. Chlamydia rates are also increasing in Ramsey County as well as Minnesota, and Ramsey Coun ty had the highest chlamydia and gonorrhea rates compared to other counties in the study area in 2014. Chlamydia rates in both St. Croix County and Wisconsin are increasing. According to the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 , the Youth Risk Behavior Sur veillance System Survey indicates that over onethird (36.1%) of students reported ever having sexual intercourse. Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 8Priority #3: Chronic Disease and Illness Prevention Continued Asthma Emergency Department visit rates are higher in Ramsey County than in Minnesota (20112013). According to the Minnesota Department of Health, between 30% and 59.9% of children ages 2435 months in Ramsey and Washington Counties have their recommended immunizations, compared to approximately 63% of children in the state (2013). The per centage of mothers who received adequate or better prenatal care in Ramsey and Washington Counties has recently decreased. St. Croix County has also had a decreasing percentage of mothers who received prenatal care in the first trimester since 2010. Tobacco use and exposure is identified as an area of co ncern in both the Washington County Community Health Improvement Plan 2014 and the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142015 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey. In 2010, 14.5% of females and 17.7% of males in Minnesota were current smokers. Washington County had the highest rate of male ev eryday smokers (21.4%) out of the Minnesota study area counties. In 2010, 21% of St. Croix County adult residents reported that they currently smoke, as compared to 21% of Wisconsin adult residents. Priority #4: Equitable Care There are approximately 532,655 residents in Ramsey County, 249,283 residents in Washington County, and 86,759 residents in St. Croix County (2014). Each county in the study area had a higher overall population percent growth than both Minnesota and Wisconsin (20102014). The 65 and older population experienced the greatest percentage incr ease of all age groups in every county in the study area and in Minnesota and Wisconsin (20102014). Washington County has the highest median age in the hospital's study area, which is also higher than Minnesota's median age. St. Croix and Washington Counties' median ages are increasing, while Ramsey County's median ag e is remaining relatively stable. Ramsey County is also one of the most diverse counties in the study area. There are approximately 12% Black or African American residents and approximately 14% Asian residents in Ramsey County. Black populations in Ramsey, Washington and St. Croix Counties also increased between 2010 and 2014, as we ll as Asian populations in Ramsey and Washington Counties. Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 9Priority #4: Equitable Care Continued Data indicates that there is inequity among diverse populations. For example, there are significant disparities in high school graduation rates across racial groups in Minnesota (20132014) and in high school completion rates across in St. Croix County and 18.6% of children in Ramsey County are food insecure (2013) and 8.3% of seniors in Minnesota and 11% of seniors in Wisconsin are threatened by hunger (2013). Ramsey County identified social det erminants of health in the Ramsey County Community Health Improvement Plan 20142018 . This includes poverty, income, education, unemployment, home ownership and affordable housing, and transportation. Washington County emphasizes addressing issues related to health equity by targeting vulnerable populations across their three community health priorities in the Washington County Community Health Impro vement Plan 2014 . According to the St. Croix County Community Health Needs Assessment and Improvement Plan 20142016 , homelessness, domestic violence, and lack of public transportation are issues facing families in St. Croix County. The Healthiest Wisconsin 2020: Everyone Living Better, Longer Infrastructure Focus Areas include: diverse, suf ficient, competent workforce that promotes and protects health; health literacy and education; and equitable, adequate, stable public health funding. When asked what they would do if they were in charge of improving the overall health of the community, participants in the community conversations conducted by Lakeview Hospital indicated that reducing ga ps in care and improving health education would be two of the seven main priorities.

Review of Current Research: HealthPartners pro vided Community Hospital Consulting with various studies that have been conducted for each county in the system's study area. Community Hospital Consulting summarized the findings of each study and created an overall matrix of community health needs across all seven counties. Community Input: HealthPartners and its hospitals participated extensively in community conversations, collaborative initiatives with local public health departments that included surveys and interviews with required groups. A summary of those efforts is included in this report. Prioritization Strategy: Four significant needs were determined by assessing the prevalence of the issues identified in the health data findings, combined with the frequency and severity of mentions in the community input. Three factors were used to rank those needs during the CHNA Team meeting on August 24, 2015. Evaluation of Hospital's Impact: IRS Final Regulations require a hospital facility to conduct an evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospital facility finished conducting its immediately preceding CHNA. Each hospital has tracked the progress made on previously listed activities and a summary of impact is provided in each facilityspecific report. Available Community Resources: In addition to the services provided by HealthPartners and its hospitals, other charity care services and health resources available in the community were provided by each hospital. Community Hospital Consulting compiled the lists and included them in each hospital's report.

Between December 2007 and September 2009 there was a shortage of the Hib vaccination which lead to a temporary suspension of the booster shot for most children in the U.S. This explains the dip in fullcovera ge in 2009 and 2010, which rebounded by 2011. 46% 43%48%77% 76% 74% Minnesota Wisconsin U.S.24 Month Olds Who Were Immunized 2009 - 2013 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 77Oral Health Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SMART Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data, apps.nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSS SMART/; data accessed June 10, 2015 Note: The following counties are represented in the Minneapolis St. Paul Bloomington, MN WI Metropolitan Statistical Area: Anoka County, County, MN; County, MN; County, MN; Washington County, MN; Wright County, MN75.7% 74.8%72.0% Minneapolis - St. Paul - Bloomington MSAMinnesota WisconsinOral Health Visited the Dentist or Dental Clinic within the Past Year for any Reason 2012, Ages 18 and OlderApproximately 75.7% of respondents in the Minneapolis - St. Paul - Bloomington MSA visited the dentist or dental clinic within the past year for any reason, compared to 74.8% in Minnesota and 72.0% in Wisconsin.

Every three years, a Community Health Needs Assessment is to be completed and needs to include a written three-year Implementation Plan. The Plan is to be reviewed and updated annually. We at HealthPartners believe the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is a written extension of our mission to improve health and well-being in partnership with our members, patients and community. We welcome the opportunity to share this executive summary. Our HealthPartners hospitals first CHNAs, in 2012, identified the greatest needs in the communities we serve. Comprehensive assessments were conducted by the following HealthPartners hospitals: Regions Hospital in St. Paul, MN; Lakeview Hospital in Stillwater, MN; Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, MN; Hudson Hospital in Hudson, WI; Westfields Hospitals in New Richmond, WI and Amery Regional Medical Center in Amery, WI. Both the CHNAs and Implementation Plans at each of the hospitals were approved by their respective hospital boards, Q4 2012. The first year of each hospital's Implementation Plan was 2013. This executive summary is a report back of the 2014 implementation activities. The priorities that were identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment for Lakeview Hospital are as follows: 1. Increase Access to Mental Health Services 2. Promote Positive Behaviors to Reduce Obesity (Nutrition/Physical Activity) 3. Increase Access to Primary and Preventive Care 4.

Priority #2 Promote Positive Behaviors to Reduce Obesity Objective 2: Lakeview Health will support and implement initiatives to promote positive health behaviors, health awareness and education, to reduce lifethreatening conditions such as obesity and Type II diabetes. Implementation Activity: Year #2 2014 Lakeview Foundation will continue to lead and financially support PowerUp, a program that inspires and engages the entire community to promote better eating and active lives so youth can reach their full potential. In 2014, PowerUp expanded to two additional communities by working collaboratively with Hudson Hospital and Westfields Hospital. This collaboration benefits people living throughout the St. Croix Valley. A priority for 2014 was data collection. PowerUp developed a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the initiative including a community survey, sent to randomly selected households with young children. Results indicate a very high awareness for PowerUp after one year in the community. The survey also established the baseline measures for awareness, attitudes and behaviors of children and families in the targeted communities. PowerUp School Challenge reached more than 10,000 children plus school staff in more than 25 schools throughout the service area. Results indicate that teachers, families and students are highly engaged in the program with a 70% participation rate with children tracking fruits and vegetables. More than 30,000 families and children were reached through events, classes, outreach, programs and resources to promote better eating, family meals, physical activity, reduced screen time, and fewer sugary drinks. Partnerships have expanded to include schools, business, nonprofits, families, faith communities, public health and the entire community. Open gyms, in partnership with local schools, have expanded to include multi-site offerings on a weekly basis. This free option for physical activity ranks as one of the key needs identified by parents of children on the Family Community survey, Jan 2014. Breastfeeding has been linked to lower rates of obesity. Lakeview Health will continue its commitment to supporting breastfeeding initiatives at Lakeview Hospital. Lakeview Hospital participates in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), which is a global program sponsored by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund to encourage and recognize hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding. Lakeview utilizes grant funding to educate nursing staff on the Lakeview's Women's Center with five steps by encouraging: skin to skin as soon as possible after delivery; keeping their baby in the room; learning breastfeeding cues, holds and signs of hunger; exclusive breastfeeding; and asking for help with breastfeeding when unsure. Outpatient visits are coordinated with the Stillwater Medical Group with breastfeeding resource professionals for those patients that need continued breastfeeding education and encouragement. Lakeview also participates in the Washington County Breastfeeding Collaborative and a Breastfeeding Resource Group with HealthPartners to further promote and support Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 110importance of breastfeeding and to educate mothers about best practices. Health education includes staff training, patient education and lactation training, and referring mothers to breastfeeding support upon discharge. breastfeeding. Lakeview Hospital offers additional classes throughout the year focusing on community education Lakeview Hospital will continue to offer various classes to educate the public on diabetes and nutrition. For example, the Hospital offers \"Stomp Out Diabetes,\" where certified diabetes and nutrition educators teach participants what steps they can take to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. More than 1200 contacts were made with the community through community education classes to improve their health. See Appendix for class schedule. Priority #3 Increase Access to Primary and Preventive Care Objective 3: Lakeview Health will continue to provide an avenue for patients to receive holistic healthcare, including physical, emotional, and spiritual care. Implementation Activity: Year #2 2014 The St. Croix Valley Parish Nurse Program, which is a healthcare ministry providing physical, emotional and spiritual care for individuals, families and communities served by local congregations. Parish nurses are bring holistic healthcare and a variety of wellness resources to parishioners and the community \u2014 in their homes, healthcare settings and at the churches, in partnership with Lakeview. The role of the parish nurse varies from congregation to congregation based upon the needs of the church, and may include serving as a health educator, health counselor, coordinator of volunteers, integrator of faith/health relationship, referral source and health advocate. The parish nurse promotes a greater understanding of health related issues and addresses these concerns through information and education. There are nine churches in the St. Croix Valley Parish Nurse Program. In 2014, the St. Croix Valley parish nurses served 651 new clients and 1631 follow-up clients in 9 parishes throughout the St. Croix Valley. Nurses provided 2280 1:1 contacts, 1393 group contacts and more than 500 referrals to church and community resources bridging people to the whole person care, services and support that they need for healing and greater well-being. The parish nurses continue to collaborate on an event each spring for our community seniors called the Senior Health and Faith Day with the goal of educating and inspiring them to live well physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Over 240 seniors attended. Priority #3 Increase Access to Primary and Preventive Care Objective 4: Lakeview Health will continue to offer preventive cancer screenings to patients in the community. Implementation Activity: Year #2 2014 Lakeview Health partners with \"Sage,\" the largest program within the Sage Screening Program family, which is a breast and cervical Sage program continues to make important screening services available to women. cancer screening program. For eligible women, Sage provides free office visits for breast and cervical exams, as well as a screening mammogram and pap smears. If a screening test shows a problem, Sage will cover many diagnostic services and can often cover treatment, if needed. Sage partners with over 400 clinics throughout the state. Priority #4: Improve Service Integration Objective 5: Lakeview Health will continue to improve service integration and the continuum of care by offering programs that increase patients' abilities to access critical health services. Implementation Activity: Year #2 2014 Lakeview Hospital operates a non critical transport service, which enables patients to travel from one medical facility to another that might provide a more appropriate level of care. Transportation services continue to ensure patients are transported to a facility with the appropriate level of care. Lakeview Health is committed to reducing the financial stress for un insured and under insured patients. Lakeview will continue that commitment by funding various organizations that address that need. For example, Lakeview has provided funding to Portico Healthnet (Portico) in order to improve access to people without health insurance. Portico is a nonprofit organization that helps about 350 people per month enroll in free or lowcost health coverage programs. Lakeview provided support to Portico, as well as the SCV Family Medical Clinic (Southside Community Health). Lakeview hosted meetings related to the Affordable Care Act to increase understanding of this new system of accessing health insurance for health care staff and community organizations and businesses. The majority of prescription drug providers have programs that offer no to low cost medication to qualified patients. However, many patients are unaware of how to navigate this process. Lakeview Foundation funds a staff member at Lakeview Hospital who assists patients in this process, including the completion of extensive paperwork. This initiative helps over 300 people per year gain access to the medication they need. The Prescription Assistance Program provided free and/or reduced-cost medication assistance for 276 qualified clinic patients coping with chronic diseases in 2014. In support of this primary goal, the coordinator facilitated the complex process of enrollment in pharmaceutical assistance programs for patients who either lack prescription insurance or cannot afford co-pays. Additional individualized counseling on related cost-saving medication options and limited financial aid for qualifying emergency medication needs are also available. The service is delivered in a respectful, confidential manner to participants who receive free medication with an average monthly value of 22 percent of their gross monthly household income. Both providers and participants agree that the benefits derived from participation in this clinic program are invaluable for chronic disease management by providing access to needed medical treatments. Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 111Lakeview Health is a 20% owner of Boutwells Landing, which is a state of the art senior living community for people ages 55 and over, located on more than 100 acres of land in Oak Park Heights, MN. Lakeview Health provides Stillwater Medical Group employees to Boutwells Landing and provides 4 beds in \"The Gathering,\" which is the end of life hospice unit. By providing end of life palliative care, Lakeview integrates assisted living with hospice care, allowing patients to remain in one central community during the end of their lives. Support for the Gathering continues, serving patients and families with financial need at a difficult time. Priority #5 Promote Change in Unhealthy Lifestyles Objective 6: Lakeview Health will support and implement various initiatives to prevent and treat alcohol and substance abuse, and tobacco use in the community. Implementation Activity: Year #2 2014 Lakeview Foundation will continue to provide leadership to various groups that focus on strategic initiatives to prevent and treat tobacco use, and alcohol and substance abuse in the community. Lakeview continues to participate in multiple community collaboratives related to alcohol and substance abuse, and tobacco use including CONNECT, Youth Matters, the Washington County CLT, and the Washington County Behavioral Health Collaborative. Details include: The Community Leadership Team (CLT). Lakeview Health works in collaboration with the Community Leadership Team (CLT) on both tobacco cessation and obesity initiatives. Behavioral Health Summit: Lakeview is an active participant in the Washington County Summit to explore priority needs in the area of Behavioral (Mental health and substance abuse). The \"CONNECT\" Collaborative mission of is to prevent and reduce youth alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use through partnership, education, intervention and community change. CONNECT meets monthly and is a county-wide resource network for the community. Lakeview Foundation will continue to raise funds to support the Youth Alcohol and Drug Program (YADP) (New Name Youth Matters). Youth Matters is an effort to reduce alcohol and drug abuse in the Stillwater area. Lakeview Foundation supported Youth Matters (formerly YADP) to bring Courage Retreats to Stillwater Junior High and Oakland Junior High Schools, a prevention program for issues facing junior high youth. Youth Matters is in the process of re evaluating focus and possibly combining with other related community collaboratives. Lakeview will stay involved in that process. Lakeview supported TreeHouse, FamilyMeans and Youth Service Bureau who provide chemical health support for teens. Lakeview Hospital will continue to offer \"Freedom from Smoking\" cessation classes at low to no cost to people in the community. This program runs between 2 and 4 times a year. Program offered twice in 2014 however registration was low. The class is now offered on as needed basis and promotion has been enhanced in partnership with Washington County Public Health's focus on tobacco. New options, such as online programs, are also being explored to make the resource more convenient to community members.

Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 210 Connecting People Experiencing Homelessness to Shelter & Housing In Washington County, a new system called Coordinated Access is available to help homeless individuals and fami- lies find temporary shelter and/or permanent housing. Homeless YOUTH (under age 22 and without any family members), call Canvas Health at 651-251 -5214 Homeless FAMILIES with children, call St. Andrews Community Resource Center at 651-762 -9124 Homeless ADULTS ( over age 22) without children, call Washington County at 651- 430-6488 If you are homeless and in need of shelter or housing... IF YOU NEED HELP , search \"Homeless Services\" 12/22/14 Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 211 What is Coordinated Access? Individuals and families seeking emergency shelter and housing in Washington County can access those resources through a pro- cess called Coordinated Access. This process helps ensure that people experiencing homelessness are connected to the right ser- vices and housing options as quickly as possible. Coordinated Access: Connecting Homeless Individuals and Families in Washington County to Shelter & Housing Assessment If you receive shelter assistance or are placed on a waiting list, a Coordinated Access specialist will conduct an as- sessment with you to determine the most appropriate referral for housing services, based upon your needs and housing barriers. Housing Referral Referrals to housing programs are priori- tized based on any health issues, previous homelessness and other factors. Support- ive housing opportunities are limited, and you may wait some time for an opening. Youth: 651-251-5214 Families: 651-762-9124 Single Adults: 651-430-6488 WASHINGTON COUNTY COORDINATED ACCESS What if I'm not homeless right now, but I'm worried I will be? Coordinated Access is only for those who are already homeless. If you are in housing and are facing eviction or otherwise need help to avoid losing your housing, there are other re- sources to call: Washington County Emergency Assis- tance: 651 -430-6455 The Salvation Army: 651 -739-6288 Canvas Health (Youth): 651 -251-5214 Before entering emergency shel- ter, a Coordinated Access spe- cialist will assist you in finding other options. Shelter beds are limited and often not available, so we will first try to help you find another way to resolve your housing crisis. People who do not have any other options may be referred to shelter or placed on a waiting list.

Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 225Information Gaps A description of any information gaps in the demographic or health data collected for this study Lakeview Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Hospital Consulting December 2015 Page 226Information Gaps While the following information gaps exist in the health data section of this report, please note that every effort was made to compensate for these gaps in the community conversations and review of current research. This assessment seeks to address the community's health needs by evaluating the most current data available. Howeve r , published data inevitably lags behind due to publication and analysis logistics. For example, 2009 2013 averages were used for mortality rates to give the most recent and accurate data. A variety of data sources were used to collect and analyze health behavior data. Due to these differences, direct comparisons betw een count i es and across states should be made with caution. For example: - The most recent local overweight and obesity data by county is provided within the 2010 Metro Adult Health Survey for Dakota, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington Counties and within the 2010 SHAPE Survey for Hennepin County. The recently conducted Metro Shape 2014 Survey results will provide overweight and obesity data for all counties mentioned above in October 2015. - Senior Food Insecurity is a growing topic and is currently available at the state and national levels through the National Foundation to End Senior Hunger (NFESH) Annual Reports. - The 2010 SHAPE Survey for Hennepin County does not contain information on sugarsweetened beverage consumption, and therefore could not be used to compare to the counties within the 2010 Metro Adult Health Survey. Timeframes for select data elements for the United States do not align with the timeframes for the study area but are reflective of the most recent year due to the fact that many data elements for the study area required a multiyear average due to low response volume. These occasions are noted in the \"so urce\" section of each data element.

Mental health diagnoses/medication are sometimes viewed as 'offensive.' -Spanish and Somali populations have difficulty navigating the system due to lack of education or lack of access to a computer. -Somali participants believe parental awareness of the system is crucial. If a parent doesn't understa nd the system, they can't be an advocate for their child. -Isolated older adults may develop depression and anxiety, but many deny it or do not want to discuss it. -Strengthen mental health through peer and community support. These are as important as the traditional medical model of service delivery . Culturally Sensitive Education About Available Services -Many populations are afraid to ask questions. Lack of Timely Healthcare Access -Appointments are weeks out, which is too long to wait for someone in crisis. -Many insurance policies don't cover mental health services.

It is more difficult to access specialty dental care (geographic gap between specialists and clinics), and it is worse for pediatric specialty care. Limited Dental Care Access -Access to affordable dental care is severely limited for Medicare patients. -Oromo representatives reported a fear regarding dental care. Many are afraid the dentist may take out their teeth or damage their teeth with deep cleaning. -Many insurance companies don't provide dental insurance, or providers don't accept the insurance people do have.

Patients will choose the Emergency Room because it is open and no appointment is needed. -Many feel that access to the Emer gency Room is less co mplicated. Higher Expectation of Emergency Rooms -Many representatives (Oromo, Vietnamese, Spanish, Hmong) believe that there is more equipment and more thorough testing in the Emergency Room. -Somali representatives believe that there aren't enough doctors in the urgent care setting. They will end up sending you to the Emergency Room, so going to the hospital is better.

Regions Hospital Community Conversations Cultural Sensitivity and Humility -There can be stereotypes from healthcare providers about age/people of color/etc. -Providers need to learn to communicate more effectively with patients, and provide immigrants with access to culturally competent care in their own language. -Providers should practice cultural humility with patients and the community in order to connect the medical and community models. -Encour age pr oviders to approach patients and communities with cultural humility. Lack of a Holistic Approach -Especially with diabetes and food choice that are culturally appropriate. \"Advocating for Yourself \" is Difficult -Some patients feel there is a power differential between doctors and patients.

Community Education on Healthcare Access is Necessary -Many people do not know which healthcare resources are available to them, and navigating the healthcare system can be overwhelming. -There can be a lack of followup with patients who need it. Encouragement to Seek Care -Fear of a diagnosis and/or stigma surrounding a diagnosis can prevent people from seeking treatment. -There is a need to stress importance of early diagnosis.

Depending on the brand of vaccine used, a child would either get 3 doses of Hib plus a booster, or 2 doses of Hib plus a booster; at the state-level, the CDC no longer reports Hib simply as 3 or more doses but instead specifies that the \"full series\" was received.Between December 2007 and September 2009 there was a shortage of the Hib vaccination which lead to a temporary suspension of the booster shot for most children in the U.S. This explains the dip in full-coverage in 2009 and 2010, which rebounded by 2011.
