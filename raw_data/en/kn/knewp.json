Because of this, VAERS data alone cannot determine if the reported adverse event was caused by a COVID-19 vaccination. MYTH: The mRNA vaccine is not considered a vaccine. FACT: mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, work differently than other types of vaccines, but they still trigger an immune response inside your body.
