Variable vaccine performance has been observed in test-negative case-control designs. There is also scarce real-world data of health issues in individuals receiving vaccines after prior COVID-19, and of adverse events of significant concern (AESCs) in the vaccinated. Methods: A cohort study was conducted from July 2021 to December 2021 in a tertiary hospital of North India. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 during the second wave in India. Secondary outcomes were AESCs, and persistent health issues in those receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors of COVID-19 outcomes and persistent health issues. Results: Of the 2760 health care workers included, 2544 had received COVID-19 vaccines, with COVISHIELD (rChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccine) received by 2476 (97.3%) and COVAXIN (inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) by 64 (2.5%). A total of 2691 HCWs were included in the vaccine effectiveness analysis, and 973 COVID-19 events were reported during the period of analysis. Maximum effectiveness of two doses of vaccine in preventing COVID-19 occurrence was 17% across three different strategies of analysis adopted for robustness of data. One-dose recipients were at 1.27-times increased risk of COVID-19. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was a strong independent protective factor against COVID-19 (aOR 0.66). Full vaccination reduced moderate-severe COVID-19 by 57%. Those with lung disease were at 2.54-times increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19, independent of vaccination status. AESCs were observed in 33/2544 (1.3%) vaccinees, including one case each of myocarditis and severe hypersensitivity. Individuals with hypothyroidism were at 5-times higher risk and those receiving a vaccine after recovery from COVID-19 were at 3-times higher risk of persistent health issues. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination reduced COVID-19 severity but offered marginal protection against occurrence. The possible relationship of asthma and hypothyroidism with COVID-19 outcomes necessitates focused research. With independent protection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and high-risk of persistent health issues in individuals receiving vaccine after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, the recommendation of vaccinating those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection needs reconsideration.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-20", "cleaned_text": "Persistent Health Issues, Adverse Events, and Effectiveness of Vaccines during the Second Wave of COVID-19: A Cohort Study from a Tertiary Hospital in North India [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071153](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071153) [COVID-19 Vaccines [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01153)]. Post-authorization data for most of these leading vaccines have been predominantly derived from test-negative case-control studies [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01153), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01153), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01153)]. The test-negative design can control selection and information bias but does not effectively block the bias due to health-seeking behavior which differs between the vaccinated and unvaccinated and is influenced by COVID-19 severity in the individual. Further, the appropriate use of the test-negative design requires baseline matching of the groups with respect to demographic characteristics, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, comorbidities, symptoms, and other variables [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01153), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01153)]. The published vaccine effectiveness studies so far have had the limitations of categorizing individuals into cases and controls irrespective of the symptoms, not matching the individuals with respect to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and excluding individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or with comorbities [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01153), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01153), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01153)]. It is quite likely that the true estimates of vaccine effectiveness may be better calculated in a cohort design while studying a fixed population with similar exposure levels and while considering prior infection and comorbidities [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01153)]. To the best of our knowledge, such studies are lacking. [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01153), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01153), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01153)]. The issue of long-term safety and adverse events of special interest has not been addressed by the major real-world vaccine effectiveness studies. The incidence and patterns of such adverse events need to be addressed with equal emphasis to provide a better understanding of the benefit-risk ratio of COVID-19 vaccines and to stratify patients at risk of developing adverse events. In this regard, a one-year prospective observational safety study in vaccinated priority groups had been initiated by us in our institute since February 2021 [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01153)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01153)]. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic started from mid-March 2021, peaking around mid-April 2021, and reached the baseline by the end of May 2021 ( [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01153)). The period from 16 March 2021-31 May 2021 was, hence, primarily selected for the estimation of real-world vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19. However, data was collected until the end of study period (December 2021) and the evaluation of AESCs and persisting health issues was performed until 31 December 2021. The authors UK and SSC had access to the complete data. 2.2. Study Participants [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01153)]. These cases were compared to those with no COVID-19-like events for determination of risk factors of incidence. Severity of COVID-19 was also decided as per MoHFW guidelines [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01153)]. Moderate-severe forms of COVID-19 events were combined into one group and analyzed in determining risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Healthcare workers (HCWs) who were symptomatic during the study period but negative in RT-PCR lab reports were excluded from the analysis. To avoid survival bias, information was collected from each department regarding any deaths of employees during the study period, and family members were contacted to extract the details of vaccination status and mortality of these individuals. 2.3. Ethical Permission 2.4. Data Sources/Measurement 2.5. Outcome Measures 2.5.1. Primary Outcomes [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01153)). This strategy was employed because in the case that onset of second wave or end of second wave had been taken as reference date instead of 12 April, there could have been potential underestimation or overestimation of vaccine effectiveness, which we wanted to avoid. Individuals were labelled as recipients of '0' dose if no vaccine dose was received before occurrence of COVID-19 or the date of 12 April 2021. [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01153)]. To correct for this period, in definition B, participants were labelled as '2'-dose recipients if the second dose had been received >14 days before the reference date and were labelled as '1'-dose recipients if the first dose had been received at any time before the reference date. As in definition A, reference dates for those developing COVID-19 were either the date of laboratory diagnosis or the date of onset of symptoms, whichever was earlier. The reference date of calculating time intervals for those not developing COVID-19 was fixed on 12 April 2021 ( [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01153)). The '0'-dose group included those who did not receive any vaccine dose before occurrence of COVID-19 or the set date of 12 April 2021. 2.5.2. Secondary Outcomes - Any serious AEFI; - Any severe AEFI (FDA grade 3); - Any moderate-severe AEFI (FDA grade 2-3) which persisted for 7 days; - Any moderate AEFI (FDA grade 2) which persisted for 4 weeks; - Any mild-moderate AEFI (FDA grade 1-2) that persisted for 12 weeks. - Vaccine (post-COVID-19)-associated: If health events were reported in those who received COVID-19 vaccine after recovering from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past; - COVID-19 (post-vaccine)-associated: If events were reported in those who developed COVID-19 after receiving COVID-19 vaccine; - COVID-19-associated: If events were reported in unvaccinated individuals who developed COVID-19; - Vaccine-associated: If events were reported in vaccinated individuals with no history of COVID-19 until date of enrollment. 2.6. Sample Size [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01153)]. Considering a 5% rate of exclusion of participants because of incomplete information, a minimum sample size of 2400 was required. The data collection was stopped on 31 December 2021, by which time 2765 participants had been enrolled. 2.7. Statistical Analysis 2.8. Role of Funding Source 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Data [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01153-f001)shows a flowchart of selection of participants and steps followed in each analysis. The mean age of HCWs was 34.9 (\u00b19.9) years (male = 1740, female = 1020). A total number of 2544 HCWs had received COVID-19 vaccines, with by 2476 (97.3%) vaccine) by 64 (2.5%). One HCW each received the Pfizer vaccine (during international travel), the Sputnik vaccine, COVISHIELD followed by COVAXIN, and COVAXIN followed by COVISHIELD. After excluding 69 HCWs who were RT-PCR-negative suspects, 2691 HCWs were included for vaccine effectiveness analysis. A total of 1033 COVID-19 events were identified in them from the period of February to December 2021, out of which 973 events occurred in 969 HCWs in the second wave period or the analysis period for vaccine effectiveness (16 March to 31 May 2021). Four HCWs developed COVID-19 twice in this period. Of these 973 events, 238 were rated as moderate-severe grade ( [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01153-t001)). 3.2. Main Results 3.2.1. Occurrence of COVID-19 [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01153-t001)a shows results of bivariate analysis to determine the association between potential covariates and occurrence of COVID-19. In unadjusted analysis, age, sex, prior history of COVID-19, presence of hypothyroidism, and vaccination status shared a statistically significant association with occurrence of COVID-19 and were selected for Cox proportional hazard analysis. Occurrence of COVID-19 was common in HCWs who were young, females, and had a history of hypothyroidism. No significant difference in COVID-19 occurrence was seen between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups when assessed as per standard definition of vaccination status, i.e., definition A. Interestingly, COVID-19 occurred more commonly in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated when assessed as per definition B which assessed the transient immune suppression after the first vaccine dose and also considered the probability of vaccination centers being super-spreader sites. The occurrence of COVID-19 was less common in HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (p < 0.001). [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01153-f002)shows comparison of time to occurrence of event (COVID-19) between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Individuals belonging to the '1'-dose group developed COVID-19 earlier compared to the unvaccinated and the '2'-dose group with statistical significance (p = 0.03). After adjusting for potential confounders in the Cox proportional hazard model, age, sex, prior history of COVID-19, and vaccination status emerged as tentative determinants of occurrence of COVID-19 ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01153-t002)a). The risk of occurrence of COVID-19 was nearly 1.45 times greater for those <40 years of age as compared to participants 40 years, 1.22 times greater for females compared to males, and 1.27 times greater in the '1'-dose group compared to the unvaccinated. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was an independent protective factor with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 in this group compared to those with no history of SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). 3.2.2. Severity of COVID-19 [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01153-t001)b shows the results of bivariate analysis to determine the association between potential covariates and severity of COVID-19. Pre-existing lung disease and vaccination status were found to be associated with moderate-severe forms of COVID-19 with statistical significance. Disease burden as well as time to recovery from COVID-19 were significantly lower in '2'- and '1'-dose groups compared to the '0'-dose group. Median time to recovery was 10 (7,18) days in the '0'-dose group and 7 (5,14) days for the '2'-dose group (p = 0.002). Disease burden expressed as median number of symptoms was 5 (3,7) in the '0'-dose group and 3 (2,5) in the '2'-dose group (p < 0.001). Vaccine effectiveness for 2 doses (with respect to 0 dose) in reducing severity was 46.4% and 49.1% as per definitions A and B, respectively. The corresponding effectiveness in pure analysis was 51.2% (definition C). [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01153-t002)b). Compared to the unvaccinated, the HCWs in the '2'-dose group were at 57% lower risk of suffering from moderate-severe COVID-19. 3.2.3. Persistent Health Issues [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01153-f001)). [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01153-t003)shows association between potential covariates and persistence of adverse health events in HCWs receiving the vaccine before or after COVID-19. With statistical significance, persistent health issues were common in the 40 years age group. Vaccinated HCWs with a history of hypothyroidism, inflammatory arthritis, diabetes mellitus, or allergy were more likely to have persistent health issues. Interestingly, a higher percentage of HCWs who received the vaccine after natural COVID-19 (in the year 2021) had persistent health issues compared to those who received the vaccine before COVID-19. [Table 4](#vaccines-10-01153-t004)shows results of logistic regression and validates potential risk factors of persistent health issues in HCWs. After adjusting for potential confounders, presence of hypothyroidism was associated with an approximately 5-times higher risk of persistent health issues, and history of allergy was associated with a 2-times higher risk. Receiving the vaccine after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of second wave was associated with a nearly 3-times higher risk of persistent health issues. These risk factors were validated even when analysis was extended to involve any SARS-CoV-2 infection of the past, including of the year 2020. 3.2.4. Descriptive Data of Persistent Health Issues [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-01153-f003). A majority (n = 74) of the HCWs reporting persistent health events had received the vaccine after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and belonged to the 'vaccine (post-COVID-19)' group. A total of 34 individuals complaining of persistent health issues were in the 'COVID-19 (post-vaccine)' group. When classified as per MedDRA, a majority of the persistent health issues (in 124 HCWs) belonged to the SOC of 'general disorders and administration site conditions' (n = 35) followed by 'musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' (n= 22) and 'cardiac disorders' (n = 3.2.5. Events of (AESCs) [Table 5](#vaccines-10-01153-t005)). developed 'severe' AEFIs, six had AEFIs of moderate-severe grade that persisted for 1 week, eight had 'moderate' AEFIs that persisted for 4 weeks, and four had mild-moderate AEFIs which lasted for 12 weeks. These AESCs persisted with no or partial recovery in 13 HCWs. One HCW had a miscarriage and one died due to a cardiac event. Two HCWs recovered while on new treatment and full recovery was seen in the remaining 16 HCWs. Time to recovery varied from 3-150 days. Of the three deaths reported in our study, one death occurred due to cardiac arrest in a male patient in his 40s with underlying obesity, uncontrolled hypertension, and diabetes. The deceased had received his first dose of vaccine around 1.5 months before the event. The remaining two deaths occurred in unvaccinated individuals, one with underlying hypertension, and the other with underlying diabetes (one confirm COVID-19, one suspect COVID-19). 4. Discussion [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01153)]. Nearly 40% breakthrough infection rates were reported by us in doctors, a majority of whom are currently employed in the institute where our study was planned. To make comparisons with the HCWs who were unvaccinated at the time of the pandemic and to generate region-specific vaccine effectiveness data, the study was extended to include other healthcare workers of the institute. [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01153), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01153), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01153), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01153)]. On the contrary, a marginal COVID-19 protection rate (<6%) was observed with COVID-19 vaccines in this study after following the standard definitions of timings of immune protection which have been used in all pivotal trials of COVID-19 vaccines. These wide variations can be explained, to some extent, by the study designs employed in the majority of post-approval vaccine studies. The test-negative case-control designs on which the published studies were based categorize the individuals into cases and controls depending upon the results of laboratory tests. These designs effectively control the selection bias of symptomatology-based traditional case-control studies. Unchecked, however, are the differences in health-seeking behavior due to variable presentations and severity of disease in individuals. The design should not be used in situations where patterns of presentation of disease vary in cases and controls. Baseline characteristics of cases and controls also need to be matched in the absence of which, potential errors are generated in the estimation of vaccine effectiveness rates. Further, since test-negative designs rely only on laboratory tests, the sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory assay becomes a major determining factor in case identification. Many of the post-approval studies have had these limitations. [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01153), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01153)]. However, since a majority of the observed COVID-19 infections in our study were breakthrough, a direct immunomodulatory action of COVID-19 vaccines should also be investigated as a potential cause of suboptimal vaccine protection and increased propensity towards COVID-19. Some evidence, in this regard, is provided by a detailed Chinese study on post-vaccination immune modulation [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01153)]. Interestingly, the exploratory results of a pooled analysis of RCTs suggested a negative vaccine efficacy (11% to 74%) against asymptomatic COVID-19 within 6-8 weeks of vaccination with the ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccine [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01153)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01153), [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01153)]. However, the protection offered by vaccines remained statistically significant in regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounders. Compared to the unvaccinated, fully vaccinated individuals were at 57% lower risk of moderate-severe disease. These findings are close to the effectiveness reported by another group from North India [ [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01153)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01153)]. One possible explanation for increased severity of COVID-19 in health care workers with asthma can be related to their occupation. The health care workers compared to the general population are not able to avoid high-risk situations and, hence, are exposed to the virus for a longer duration. The majority of participants with asthma enrolled in this study had disease of mild-moderate severity and were controlled either on inhaled corticosteroids or systemic leukotriene antagonists. The evidence associating asthma to COVID-19 is conflicting at present. Contrary to expected, asthma was observed to be an underrepresented comorbidity in hospitalized COVID-19 individuals [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01153)]. In a large cohort study using electronic health records of patients in England, mild-moderate asthma (not requiring systemic steroids) was rather not associated with worse clinical outcomes [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01153)]. Only a modest risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes (aHR 1.13) existed with severe asthma. It has been suggested that the Th phenotype of patients should be explored to delineate the relationship of asthma with COVID-19 [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01153)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01153)]. No risk was observed with these factors in this study, mainly because of their underrepresentation in the sample of health care workers. Limitations [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01153)]. Furthermore, though the study detected serious adverse events at higher-than-expected rates, the exact incidence of rare but serious events needs confirmation from larger sample studies. This study being conducted in a localized region of North India provides a region-specific vaccine performance and, therefore, might have more of local impact on future vaccination policies. In some behavior assessment studies, vaccines have been accepted as an effective preventive measure against COVID-19 by specific high-risk groups such as elderly [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01153)]. Future cohort studies with adequate enrollment of elderly and different ethnicities are recommended to generate risk group-specific evidence on vaccine performance. 5.
