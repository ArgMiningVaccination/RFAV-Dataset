Includes safe non-stick cookware, as well as cast iron, stainless steel and more. From our mom's advice to the doctor's office, we've always been told that healthy eating is the backbone of a healthy lifestyle. And cooking healthy food at home is pretty much the backbone of healthy eating, right? But cue the record scratch when I say that some of the cookware you are using in your kitchen is not helping your healthy eating efforts at all - in fact, it might be hurting it. In this post we will take a look at the health concerns with many types of cookware and then I'll share the best non-toxic cookware brands that I've found in my many years of cooking! Why Non-Toxic Cookware is Important How could something as healthy as cooking be harming our health? Sadly, it's because cooking pans (and most products available on the market today) are not well regulated for safety. Because of this, companies are able to use chemicals and manufacturing processes that either have not been tested for safety or in some cases, have been shown to be harmful but have not been outright banned. Let's take a look at the biggest health concerns with cookware: Non-stick coatings - The coatings used to create traditional Teflon-style non-stick cookware contain perfluorinated compounds (known perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which have been linked to cancer, elevated cholesterol, hormone disruption and other health issues. Heat causes the chemicals to break down and release toxic fumes into the air. Over time the nonstick coatings can get scratched and start to peel, so that you may be ingesting some of that nasty stuff. On top of that, PFOAs don't biodegrade, meaning they will always be in the environment and have been shown to accumulate in our bodies (more about [health risks from PFAS contamination](https://www.verywellhealth.com/pfas-awareness-and-risks-5220490)). Traditional non-stick pans or Teflon cookware are the #1 type of cookware you should swap out right away.* Aluminum - Aluminum is a fantastic heat conductor but there are concerns that cooking with aluminum could cause neurological issues in some people. This argument is hotly debated but to be safe, keep cooking in exposed aluminum to a minimum, especially when cooking acidic foods such as tomatoes, vinegar, and citrus. Heavy metals: Heavy metals like lead & cadmium are sometimes detected in colored enamel pans - especially the reds and oranges. A brand new pan is probably not a problem, but once the surface has been scratched or chipped, heavy metal leaching may occur. Nanoparticles - Ceramic non-stick cookware is increasingly popular but there is some concern about nanoparticles of titanium dioxide used in cheap \"quasi-ceramic\" coatings that may be released due to scratches and wear and tear of the coating over time ( [source](https://www.foodpackagingforum.org/news/nanoparticles-released-by-quasi-ceramic-pans)). That said, there are no conclusive studies on this. Choose ceramic non-stick cookware brands that are transparent about manufacturing and perform third-party safety testing. *Note: Beware non-stick cookware that claims to be PFOA-free. It probably contains PTFE, which is likely just as bad! Best Non-Toxic Cookware Options I may receive commissions from purchases made through links in this article. [Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) To say we love to cook at our house is an understatement. For my husband and myself and even for our two boys, cooking is not only nourishment, it is entertainment, a fun hobby, an obsession, a great way to procrastinate....and most importantly, cooking is LOVE!! We own MANY cooking pots and pans. Too many probably, but we have a hard time being minimalist in the kitchen. The good news is, I've tested out many pots and pans in order to help you find the best quality, safe cookware around! Be assured that the non-toxic pans I mention below are those that I highly recommend. Here are my favorite types and brands of healthy, non-toxic cookware (including the best non-toxic cookware sets): Cast Iron Cookware Cast iron cookware is like your reliable friend - it's always there for you when you need it. Cast iron is known for great heat retention - just be sure to heat it up slowly to avoid burning. The best cast iron cookware in my opinion, is just plain cast iron, without any enamel or other coatings. Avoid thin or cheap cast iron as it might not live up to your expectations. Many cast iron pans come pre-seasoned, making it easy to get started without a hassle. [I've busted some common myths about cast iron here.](https://mindfulmomma.com/how-cast-iron-can-get-you-unstuck-from-non-stick/) Favorite Cast Iron Cookware Brand: [Lodge](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Lodge/page/8CDF8DDD-A601-44CD-B8E7-BD01D910704A?&linkCode=ll2&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=555430e700a5421beff94b7354f36456&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Why I love it: High quality, pre-seasoned cast iron without any coatings that is made to last forever. All of their seasoned cast iron is made in the USA. Whether you are looking for one cast iron pan or many, Lodge is a great brand! Suggested products: Another cast iron cookware brand that I've heard good things about but haven't personally tried is [Stargazer](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1323656&u=451673&m=86485&urllink=&afftrack=). Stargazer claims to be smoother, lighter, safer than other cast iron brands. Stainless Steel Cookware Stainless steel is the darling of the cooking world. It's super durable, safe to use and beautiful to look at! You can also cook with stainless steel pans at high heat. The best stainless steel cookware is made from high quality 18/10 stainless and has an aluminum core (aluminum is a great heat conductor), but is completely encased in stainless steel. Avoid cheap stainless steel cookware that might not hold up over time. There is some concern about the nickel and chromium in stainless steel as a very small number of people are sensitive to it - but most of us can use stainless cookware without concern. Favorite Stainless Steel Cookware Brands: 1.) [360 Cookware](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Lodge/page/8CDF8DDD-A601-44CD-B8E7-BD01D910704A?&linkCode=ll2&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=555430e700a5421beff94b7354f36456&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (stainless steel with an aluminum core) Why I love it: 360 Cookware is designed for waterless cooking, a technique designed to cook using the natural moisture from the food, instead of added water. The process locks in the natural flavors and nutrients in foods and uses less energy than traditional cooking as well. If you are looking for cookware that will last a long time (aka forever!), then this is it! (Bonus - this non-toxic cookware is made in the USA!) Read cookware set or want to register for one for your wedding, I recommend this one!) Deal: Mindful Momma readers get 25% off with code MindfulMomma25. 2.) All Clad Stainless Steel (stainless steel with an aluminum core) Why I love it: My All Clad pans heat quickly and evenly and I love how easy they are to clean. I bought my first All Clad pan when I worked for a cooking store and we got more for our wedding! All Clad is an excellent brand that is headquartered in Pennsylvania and the stainless steel line is made in the USA. Some people ask - Is All Clad non toxic? - and the answer is YES! Suggested products: [Buy All Clad stainless steel cookware direct](https://www.all-clad.com/cookware/materials/stainless.html) 100% Ceramic Cookware Take a trip to any store that sells cookware and you'll probably see the term ceramic on some of the pots and pans. Stop right there, because most of that cookware is not 100% ceramic but rather has a ceramic coating applied to the cooking surface of the pan - whether the pan is aluminum, cast iron or stainless steel (see below for more info on ceramic coated pans). But what I'm talking about here is 100% ceramic cookware. This type of ceramic is not a coating, it is ceramic pottery through and through. Favorite 100% Ceramic Cookware Brand: [Xtrema](https://mindfulmomma.com/XtremaMM) Why I love it: Ceramcor is a 100% ceramic line of cookware. There is no coating or glaze so nothing will ever flake, peel or scratch off this cookware. In addition, there are no bonding materials, glues, polymers, or dyes used in Xtrema. Each batch of Xtrema is third-party tested for heavy metals like lead and cadmium, making it a truly safe and healthy choice if you are shopping for non-toxic cookware. Xtrema is extremely durable and is scratch-proof and chip resistant. It is much lighter than cast iron. The only downside is that if you drop it on the floor, it could break. The company sent me a sample of the Xtrema 10 Versa Skillet and after giving it a test drive, I highly recommend it. I've cooked eggs - both fried and scrambled with great success, and even if something sticks it is super easy to clean off with a handy plastic [pan scraper](https://www.amazon.com/Scraper-Plastic-Scratch-Cleaning-Kitchen/dp/B0998ZBGYK?crid=34HEERTTFZWQZ&keywords=plastic+pan+scraper&qid=1648490761&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=plastic+pan+scraper%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE1NjNWU1VFRlpJNVQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwMzIwNTlWMk9IVzJEM1RRVlUmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMTAwNjcwNjFEWTI4NFowMFEyVEEmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=fbe0d34313e5cd9d0308551ad9411f45&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). The Versa skillet can transfer easily between the stovetop and the oven and comes with handy silicone handle protectors so you won't get burned. Plus it's a beautiful serving dish as well.

Ceramic coatings are made from silicon (not to be confused with silicone), which is basically sand, and do not use any Teflon coatings - PFOA, PTFE or anything in the PFAS category. Ceramic coated pans are considered to be safer than old school non-stick pans and use 60% less CO2 in manufacturing. However, from what I've read and learned through experience, it is important to choose high quality ceramic coated cookware over cheaper versions. Not all ceramic coatings are created equal. In fact, there is some concern about nanoparticles used in cheap ceramic coatings, as I mentioned earlier in this post. Because of these concerns, if you feel the need to have a non-stick pan in your kitchen, I recommend sticking with brands that have been certified by third party testing to meet food contact standards set by the U.S. and Europe and to be free from heavy metals and other contaminants. A downside of ceramic non-stick pans is that they are not built to last a lifetime, like stainless steel or cast iron. Over time, the coating can get scratched and you will need to replace the pans. Personally, I use my ceramic-coated pans when I really need the non-stick feature (eggs for example), and I stick with stainless steel or cast iron for the majority of my cooking. One popular brand of ceramic cookware that is readily available and does provide testing reports is [Greenpan.](https://www.amazon.com/GreenPan-Chatham-Ceramic-Non-Stick-Frypan/dp/B01MR7YMIP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=greenpan&qid=1585155286&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVEs3VThXUjg1U0ZBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzk2MDExQzhXRTg0SVNDUzEyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MTY2ODczR1lLN0xSWDU2ODRCJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=9ebc69dceaf95653e3bfc9e7c1391b1a&language=en_US) See below for more recommendations of the best non-stick cookware that is free from PFAS-type chemicals. Favorite Ceramic Coated Cookware Pan: [Always Pan](https://mindfulmomma.com/AlwaysPan) Why I love it: The Always Pan from [Our Place](https://mindfulmomma.com/OurPlaceCookware) is a multi-use pan that is designed to replace a 16-piece cookware set. The pan has a safe ceramic coating that turns out a mean fried egg without sticking. It comes with a very useful steamer basket and a cute bamboo spatula that fits onto the skillet's handle - I just love design details like that! The Always Pan has become our favorite pan in our kitchen - we use it a lot! It would also be a perfect gift for a young adult with a new apartment, or someone with very little storage space. If you are looking for a non-toxic non-stickhttps://mindfulmomma.com/AlwaysPan pan, I recommend this one! - The Always Pan uses a sol-gel non-stick coating that is made primarily from silicon dioxide - The ceramic coating is third party tested to ensure compliance with FDA and EU food contact regulations - Tested to show that absolutely nothing can pass through the coating - Free from PTFE, PFOA, PFOS, lead, cadmium and other toxic metals, and nanoparticles - Made in a female-owned factory in China - Always Pan comes in your choice of fun colors - Now a [cast iron always pan](https://mindfulmomma.com/AlwaysPanCastIron)is available too! [Our Place has beautiful and kitchen tools](https://mindfulmomma.com/OurPlaceCookware)as well. Favorite Ceramic Cookware Set: [Caraway](https://mindfulmomma.com/CarawayMM) Why I love it: First of all, Caraway Cookware is gorgeous! But it performs really well too - and in our kitchen, our pans work HARD! The aluminum core allows the pans to heat evenly and the non-toxic ceramic coating means it's great for all the non-stick cooking we need to do. If you really want a nonstick cookware set, then this is it! (individual cookware items are also available) - Made with an aluminum core, stainless steel base & handles, and a non-stick, mineral based coating - Third-party tested for lead, cadmium, PTFE (Teflon\u00ae), PFOA and other harmful chemicals - Oven safe up to 500 degrees - Works on any type of cooktop including induction - Set comes with handy pan and lid storage solution - Comes in five beautiful colors (we were gifted a set of Sage by the company) - Nonstick pots and pans can be purchased individually as well - Manufactured in ethical factories in China Porcelain Enamel Cast Iron Cookware Enameled cookware pans marry the heat retention and durability of cast iron with a hard porcelain enamel glaze that is baked onto the surface (both interior and exterior) of the pan. Because of some concern that heavy metals like lead and cadmium could leach from enamel coated pans (especially from brightly colored pans), you should be careful to purchase only from reputable sources and discontinue use if the interior surface gets chipped. Favorite brand: [Le Creuset](https://www.lecreuset.com/) Why I love it: I inherited two Le Creuset pans from my mother - a large skillet and an oval baking dish. Both are amazing for cooking and the baking dish is lovely for serving as well. LeCreuset cast iron is still made in France. LeCreuset's dutch ovens are especially well loved! LeCreuset is not cheap, but well worth the investment in my opinion! Copper Cookware Copper is an excellent conductor of heat. It heats quickly and the heat spreads throughout the pan evenly, allowing food to cook uniformly without hot spots. Copper is an essential mineral for the human body, but because too much of it could cause health problems, copper pans are almost always lined with another material. High quality copper cookware is typically lined with a thin layer of tin. The tin is non-reactive and does not interfere with the heat conduction of the copper. Tin is also naturally non-stick, an added bonus for this popular type of cookware. Favorite brand: Sertodo (you can find it at [Made Why I love it: This heavy-guage, tin-lined copper cookware is not only gorgeous but it is a joy to cook with! The lightweight handles are heat resistant and easy to hold on to. Copper cookware is an investment, but it is meant to last a lifetime! Do you have a favorite non-toxic cookware brand? I'd "}
