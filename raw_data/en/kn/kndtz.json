Because the planet could also use an immune boost. Among Americans, [80%](https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/crn-reveals-initial-data-2021-consumer-survey-dietary-supplements) use vitamins and supplements, a percentage that's increased over the past few decades. With that comes an inordinate amount of difficult-to-recycle packaging: droppers, dosage cups, cotton balls, labels, outer boxes, desiccants, and tamper-evident seals. Tack on the environmental impact of ingredients, manufacturing, and distribution, and you'll soon realize that supporting your health is undermining that of our planet's. Fortunately, vitamins and supplements in plastic free packaging are becoming increasingly available. And so to highlight the best plastic free vitamins and supplements brands we complied this list. Pop to the [end](#why) of the article to see how they were chosen. *This post contains [affiliate links](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/disclaimer/) 1.

Green Business Practices and Charitable Giving: Fyto's vitamin packets are certified for home and industrial composting. Available: [One Organic](https://us.one.organic/pages/fyto) WHY CHOOSE PLASTIC FREE VITAMINS & SUPPLEMENTS? Why should we care that our B12 supplements are packaged in a sustainable way? Unlike most of the consumer world, the supplement and vitamins industry has yet to be swept up in a green wave en masse. In the US, for example, the number of dietary supplement brands using eco-friendly packaging is currently in the \" [low double digits](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2021/06/17/The-complicated-rise-of-sustainable-supplement-packaging)\". In some cases, it's hard for them to do so. Sustainable packaging isn't always best suited for products like sensitive, fragile powders and compounds that usually come in tubs or sachets for preservation. Especially when this means a higher price point for health products that are already seen as expensive and inaccessible to many lower-income households. It's quite the dietary dilemma. On one hand, health supplements should be financially accessible for all, but we also don't want the planet to pay the extra cost instead. It's not just about the packaging. It's down the hatch in a matter of seconds, but do you know how that vitamin C was produced or where your omega-3 fatty acids are coming from? Between links to [overfishing](https://www.fao.org/3/i9540en/i9540en.pdf) and significant [carbon emissions](https://www.dsm.com/human-nutrition/en/talking-nutrition/sourcing-low-carbon-footprint-vitamin-c.html), supplement makers have a public image that is...well, not exactly eco-friendly. Oftentimes the ingredients that make their way into your favorite plastic free multivitamins are produced on farms that don't consider [sustainable food systems](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-food/sustainable-food-systems/). In some cases, entire forests are [cut down](https://ecogreenlove.com/2020/06/13/dietary-supplements/) to make way for the cultivation of health-boosting plants (not so much [foods that are sustainable](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-food/what-foods-are-sustainable/)). In others, artificial fertilizers and pesticides are used in excess, in which case we shouldn't forget the farmworkers, who then get exposed to these excessive chemicals and under-compensated with unfair wages. The industry as a whole can use a boost, which is why consumers should seek out the best zero waste supplements and vitamins for their nutritional and dietary needs and our planet. HOW WE FOUND THE BEST ZERO WASTE VITAMINS & SUPPLEMENTS Our main priority was finding the best plastic free vitamins, which required us to look beyond just the packaging to get all-around sustainable supplements. Ingredients: The [American Herbal Products Association (AHPA)](https://www.ahpa.org/News/Alerts/TabId/100/ArtMID/1052/ArticleID/903/Organic-industry-leaders-issue-updated-guidance-on-organic-dietary-supplements.aspx) joined forces with [Quality Assurance International (QAI)](https://www.qai-inc.com/) and the [Organic Trade Association (OTA)](https://ota.com/) to establish a protocol for organic supplements. Like other food products, dietary vitamins and supplements that contain agricultural products can be labeled as organic. However, certain conditions must be met: - If products contain only organic ingredients that are all certified, the product can be labeled as \"100% Organic.\" - If at least 95% of the ingredients are certified organic, the vitamin or supplement can be labeled as \"Organic.\" - With at least 70% organic ingredients, vitamins and supplements can have the statement \"Made with Organic [specified ingredients or food groups]\" on the product packaging. These products should also bear the USDA Organic seal, or one from a [USDA-accredited ](https://organic.ams.usda.gov/integrity/Certifiers/CertifiersLocationsSearchPage.aspx)certifying agency. You may spot some of these overseas, too: If you see \"organic\" on the label without any of these certifiers to back it up, there's a good chance the brand is trying to force some [greenwashing](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-greenwashing/) down your gullet. If they aren't using certified organic ingredients, many companies have made the shift to those that are [certified non-GMO](https://www.nongmoproject.org/product-verification/) or are fairly traded. In addition, many companies use ingredients that are vegan and cruelty free, but certification for these has yet to really seep into the industry. Ethical Sourcing and Supply Chain Practices: Similarly, ethical sourcing has yet to really be backed up by certifications or extensive details. While many brands claim \"ethical sourcing\" there often isn't much other information provided about where and how ingredients are sourced. In some cases, brands highlight where certain ingredients come from or where manufacturing takes place, or if factories use [GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes). However, these claims can also be nothing more than placebo pills. For example, plastic free omega 3 supplements may \"come from Norway\"\u2014but only after being caught in a [totally different place](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/are-your-supplements-sustainable/) in the South Pacific, then transported as crude fish oil to Scandinavia. The good news is that there are some noteworthy [Certified B Corps](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/) that ensure all aspects of their supply chain are regularly audited. Overall, however, even the best zero waste supplements and vitamins could use a little more transparency. Green Business Practices and Charitable Giving: In addition to using [compostable](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/what-is-compostable/) or reusable (AKA [zero waste](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/what-is-zero-waste/)) packaging, it's great to see that some are certified Carbon Neutral, partake in tree planting, or use manufacturing practices that help them reduce their impact. Additionally, some have made an effort to support the local and global community, or make zero waste supplements and vitamins more accessible to those in need through discounts. FINAL THOUGHTS ON SUSTAINABLE VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS Compared to other products, the [demand](https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/business-operations/sustainability-and-stewardship-supplements-raising-bar-responsible-industry) for sustainable, zero waste vitamins and supplements is low. It does seem to be gaining momentum though, which is why we need to keep these conversations happening. If you use vitamins and supplements to support your health and well-being, consider showing some of these sustainable brands some love. Or, consider making demands of your favorite brands, encouraging them to use planet-friendly packaging and supply chain practices. So go ahead and (vitamin) C that this article gets in front of the eyes of one of your supplementation-savvy friends or family members. "}
