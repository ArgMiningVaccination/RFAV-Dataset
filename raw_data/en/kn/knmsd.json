The efficiency shown below was measured AFTER 20,000 gallons had passed through the cartridge (when new, removal is 99+%). Most other non-standard tests show results after only one pass of contaminated water, which does not indicate how the filter will perform towards the end of its life. To pass the ANSI Standard 61 protocol, the effluent must be under the EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) throughout the test. All concentrations are measured in milligrams per liter (mg/l). Test Results detectable limit. (1) - While this test shows a reduction in these contaminants, ERA-9500/ERA-6500 is inconsistent in its removal in certain water conditions. We offer special nitrate and fluoride filters, or reverse osmosis, if removal is needed. A separate test was run on another ERA-9500/ERA-6500/GAC cartridge to determine chlorine removal capacity. The challenge solution contained 3 mg/l chlorine (most cities use less than 1 mg/l). 2 mg/l lead was also added. At 20,000 gallons, both were being removed 99.9+%. The test was terminated at 28,400 gallons when the chlorine removal rate hit 90%. The lead removal was still 97.6%.
