For most of these, there is only anecdotal support for their effectiveness. However, limited scientific research does indicate that some natural remedies may help reduce allergy attacks or provide relief from symptoms. Verywell / Ellen Lindner Allergies can impact your quality of life, so it's understandable to be interested in any treatment that might relieve symptoms. But if you're considering a natural remedy, run the idea by your healthcare provider first, as some may pose notable risks. Never reduce or discontinue an allergy medication you may currently be taking unless directed to do so by your healthcare provider. This article discusses the different natural remedies for allergies. It looks at what research shows, how these remedies can be used, and what the side effects may be. No natural remedy is effective in the event of an allergic emergency such as anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction. Exercise Regular exercise may be one of the most effective ways to help decrease allergic reactions, including respiratory allergies (related to breathing), although it isn't quite clear why. In moderation, exercise isn't harmful to people who have allergies and, of course, offers many health benefits. What the Research Shows One study looked at the effects of cold-weather exercise on adults with respiratory allergies. The participants took part in a four-hour hiking/snowshoeing tour or a day of skiing in moderately cold alpine conditions. Results showed that they had decreased allergy symptoms and an improvement in breathing tests. These effects were noted both the day after exercise and 60 days later. How Exercise Is Used People with allergies can follow the exercise recommendations for the general population. This includes at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. These activities include walking, running, cycling, treadmill exercise, swimming, and more. Warnings and Side Effects Discuss your exercise plans with your healthcare provider (especially if you also have asthma or exercise-induced asthma). Adhere to any medical restrictions you may have. It's wise to gradually increase your exercise as you build your endurance. In addition, if you have pollen allergies, take note of pollen levels before heading outside. Nasal Irrigation Nasal irrigation, also called nasal rinse or saline lavage, is often used by people who have allergies with respiratory symptoms. It is an at-home remedy that involves using sterile saltwater to clear nasal passages. What the Research Shows Research suggests nasal irrigation can help reduce allergy symptoms, facilitating breathing and sleep. How Irrigation Is Used You can perform nasal irrigation daily, or even several times a day, to relieve symptoms of congestion. You can try a nasal rinse by purchasing a kit and following instructions. One method is to use a neti pot with a saline solution. You pour the solution from the pot in one nostril and the solution drains from the other nostril. A squeeze bottle or bulb syringe can also be used. A nasal rinse may sometimes be performed in the hospital during an inpatient admission, especially for young children with severe respiratory reactions. Nasal or Sinus Rinse Recipe and Uses Warnings and Side Effects Only use distilled water or boiled water for nasal irrigation. There have been cases of amoeba infection due to the use of contaminated tap water in nasal irrigation. Also, be sure to clean the device after each use. It's best to wait an hour or more after nasal irrigation before going to bed. That ensures the saline has drained completely from your sinuses and helps to prevent coughing. Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to allergies, including allergic rhinitis (nasal congestion), allergic asthma, eczema, and anaphylaxis. This vitamin has a role in regulating immune system cells and the release of chemicals that can produce allergy symptoms. What the Research Shows Several studies suggest vitamin D supplements may reduce inflammation and allergic reactions. One study showed that vitamin D-deficient participants taking vitamin D supplements along with antihistamines (allergy medications) had improved allergy symptoms after eight weeks. There is no evidence, however, that taking vitamin D without medication would have the same effect. And it isn't clear whether taking supplements is helpful for people who already have optimal levels of vitamin D. Another study found that response to allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) in relieving allergic rhinitis was better in subjects with optimal vitamin D levels. The response was worse in those who were deficient in vitamin D. How Vitamin D Is Used If you have been diagnosed as vitamin D deficient, your healthcare provider will recommend the supplements you need. Each person has different needs, in part based on skin color and amount of sun exposure. If you aren't deficient in vitamin D, the Institute of Medicine recommends most people between ages 1 and 70 get 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. Those age 70 and older should get 800 IU of vitamin D daily. Warnings and Side Effects It is possible to take too much vitamin D, which raises calcium levels in the blood. This can result in kidney stones and calcium deposits in the heart and other organs. Exposure to sunlight also raises vitamin D levels. However, you should avoid too much exposure since it can lead to sunburn or skin cancer. Is Vitamin D Deficiency Linked to Allergies? Acupuncture The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation recommends acupuncture as one way to treat allergic rhinitis. Acupuncture is a healing practice that originated in China over 5,000 years ago. It involves stimulating points on the body with needles, pressure, or electrical probes. These points are believed to be connected by pathways creating an energy flow that affects overall health. What the Research Shows Although acupuncture has been used for allergy treatment, there have been no large, randomized controlled trials to verify its effectiveness. However, a large systematic review looked at several studies on the effects of acupuncture on allergic rhinitis. The results suggested acupuncture can improve nasal symptoms for people who have allergies, but the reason for this improvement wasn't clear. The procedure was found to be safe and without adverse effects. How Acupuncture Is Used Acupuncture is often used as a complementary therapy in addition to conventional allergy treatment. In visiting an acupuncturist, you would get a series of weekly or twice-weekly treatments for several weeks, and then follow-up treatments as needed. Warnings and Side Effects Acupuncture is generally regarded as safe, and side effects are not expected. However, it is best to look for a practitioner who is licensed, certified, or registered as required by your state. Acupuncture for Allergies Butterbur The herb butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is a shrub-like plant that grows in northern Asia, Europe, and parts of North America. Extracts from the herb have been used in folk medicine for migraine headaches, stomach cramps, cough, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. What the Research Shows The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says studies suggest root or leaf extracts of butterbur may help relieve allergic rhinitis. However, it has not been found to be useful for asthma or allergic skin reactions. How Butterbur Is Used Commercial butterbur extracts are made from the roots or leaves of the plant. They're available in capsule or tablet form to be taken by mouth. The supplement typically is taken two to four times a day for a week or longer, especially during allergy season. Warnings and Side Effects Side effects of butterbur may include indigestion, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and drowsiness. Butterbur is in the ragweed plant family. People who are allergic to ragweed, marigolds, daisies, or chrysanthemums should avoid butterbur and products that contain it. Do not take the raw butterbur herb on its own or as a tea, extract, or capsule. It contains substances called pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be toxic to the liver and lungs and may cause cancer. Women who are pregnant or nursing, children, and people with kidney or liver disease should not take butterbur in any form. What Is Butterbur? Quercetin Quercetin is an antioxidant, which helps prevent damage to cells. It reduces inflammatory cells and proteins, especially in skin. It is found naturally in foods such as apples (with the skin on), berries, red grapes, red onions, capers, and black tea. It is also available in supplement form. Some people use it for allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and asthma. What the Research Shows In the lab, quercetin helps restrict the release of histamine, a chemical released by cells in allergic reactions. It can also inhibit the formation of IgE antibodies, another component of the allergic response. Quercetin is chemically related to the existing anti-allergy drug cromolyn sodium. Quercetin has potential for the development of allergy and asthma therapy. However, research has largely been limited to its effects in test tube or animal studies, without clinical studies of humans. There is some evidence that it may help reduce the effects of allergic skin reactions, such as atopic dermatitis. How Quercetin Is Used There are numerous dietary sources of quercetin. Quercetin is also available as a nutritional supplement in tablet or capsule form. A typical dose for allergies and hay fever is between 200 milligrams (mg) and 400mg three times a day. Warnings and Side Effects Quercetin should be avoided by people with kidney disease, as well as people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Health Benefits of Quercetin Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats. These are fats your body needs but can't make itself, so you need to get them from your diet. Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids include fish, walnuts, vegetable oil, flax seeds, and leafy vegetables. Research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the production of inflammatory chemicals in the body, which have a role in allergies and asthma. What the Research Shows Omega-3 fatty acid supplements have been shown in research to reduce some of the effects of asthma and atopic dermatitis. However, many studies are on animal models or in the test tube, rather than human studies. Researchers are looking at whether taking omega-3 fish oil supplements when you're pregnant can reduce atopic dermatitis and food allergies in infants. There have been some positive findings, but this research is still very preliminary. How Omega-3 Fatty Acid Are Used Common sources of omega-3 fatty acids include the following: Flaxseed oil: 1 tablespoon two to three times a dayWalnuts: 1 ounce (14 halves) a dayFish oil capsules: 1 to 1.2 grams of EPA and DHA per day Warnings and Side Effects Side effects of fish oil may include indigestion and a fishy aftertaste. Fish oil has a mild \"blood-thinning\" effect. If you are taking Coumadin (warfarin) or heparin, or are at risk of bleeding complications, do not take fish oil without consulting a healthcare provider. Fish oil should not be taken two weeks before or after surgery. Stinging Nettle Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) is an herb that may reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. This natural remedy is thought by some to be one of the most effective herbal supplements for relieving allergy symptoms. What the Research Shows One randomized double-blind clinical trial in humans found that stinging nettle seemed to reduce allergy symptoms. There were some changes in clinical measures such as eosinophil counts (a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions) in nasal smears. However, these are very preliminary findings, and more studies are needed. How Stinging Nettle Is Used Stinging nettle can be used as a tea. Extracts may be found in a variety of supplements for allergy support. Warnings and Side Effects Stinging nettle has diuretic properties, meaning it causes your kidneys to make more urine. It should not be used unless you consult your healthcare provider, especially if you are taking diuretics for fluid retention. Recap Stinging nettle is an herb that may help improve allergic rhinitis, but research is limited. Ask your doctor before taking it as a supplement, since it can act as a diuretic and increase urine. Uses of Stinging Nettle Probiotics and Prebiotics Probiotics are live organisms, or \"good\" bacteria, that help improve the health of the digestive and immune systems. Prebiotics are a type of fiber that encourages the growth of probiotic bacteria. Added to infant formula, they may help improve immune responses. What the Research Shows Research has looked at whether probiotics during pregnancy and breastfeeding can reduce the risk of eczema (atopic dermatitis) in at-risk infants. The World Allergy Organization (WAO) says the evidence is limited for using probiotics for pregnant and breastfeeding women for allergy prevention. However, they still recommend probiotic use by those whose infants would be at high risk of developing an allergy. They also recommend probiotic use by those infants. The WAO also found that the evidence for using prebiotics is limited. However, for infants who are not exclusively breastfed, supplementing with prebiotics may be considered. They note there are no studies of prebiotic supplements for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Because of this, they make no recommendation for maternal use of prebiotics. How Probiotics and Are Prebiotics Used Probiotics are available in a variety of forms, including supplemental drinks, kefir, yogurt, and capsules. Prebiotics are found in fermented foods. They are also available in tablets, capsules, and chewable products. Warnings and Side Effects Probiotics and prebiotics are generally safe. But if you are sensitive to dairy products or other possible ingredients, check for sources that are safest for you. Recap Probiotics, or \"good\" bacteria, can be found in kefir, yogurt, and capsules. Prebiotics are a type of fiber that promotes probiotic growth. Both are thought to be beneficial for immune health, but data is limited on whether they help prevent allergies. Black Cumin Seed Oil Black cumin seed oil has several active chemical compounds, including thymoquinone, which evidence suggests may relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis. What the Research Shows In one study, people with allergic rhinitis were exposed to black cumin seed oil by smelling it or rubbing it on the forehead. They found they had reduced nasal congestion, nasal itching, runny nose, and sneezing attacks. Another study used black cumin seed oil in the form of nasal drops to treat allergic rhinitis. A six-week treatment course showed good results in relieving symptoms. How It's Used Black cumin seed oil is sold in capsules as well as in bulk oil form. It can be taken as a supplement once or twice a day. Or, as in the studies of rhinitis, it can be rubbed on the skin, smelled, or applied as nose drops. Warnings and Side Effects Studies have found no significant side effects for black seed oil. However, there is always the possibility of a skin reaction when applied topically. Test a small amount on your skin before using it consistently. Continue to monitor your skin for reactions while using it for any length of time. Supplement Safety Supplements aren't always tested for quality and are largely unregulated, so the content of a product may differ from what's listed on its label. Safety for certain individuals (e.g., nursing mothers, those taking medications, etc.) is also not established.To ensure that what's on the label is indeed what you are getting, opt for supplements that have been voluntarily submitted for testing by an independent certifying body like U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International.Brands certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) can also reduce your risk of exposure to unwanted chemicals and pesticides. Always talk to your healthcare provider before taking a supplement for allergies or any other concern. Summary Many types of natural remedies are thought to help ease allergy symptoms. These include exercise, nasal irrigation, probiotics, prebiotics, and various herbs and supplements. For many of these, research is still limited on how they affect allergies. Talk with your doctor first to let them know your symptoms. They can help answer your questions about how natural treatments might work with your other allergy medications.
