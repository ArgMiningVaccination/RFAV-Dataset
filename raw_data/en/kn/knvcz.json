S ee Section II.B.4 for details. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 11 school district, charter school, university, community college, non -state groups, and COBRA participants and their enrolled dependents. Plan participants are primarily located within the State of Delaware, although a small number of participants reside in other states and countries. There are multiple employer units and non -payroll groups located in three counties throughout the State, with each exercising a high degree of independence. The SEBC contracts with Ceridian for administration of COBRA and wit h Human Management Services (HMS) for administration of employee assistance services. The dental and vision benefit plans are 100% employee pay -all and are not included with the health plan. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) services are carved out and administered by Express Scripts. The selected organization(s) will be required to share specific claim and utilization data for all self -funded plans with the PBM vendor and data warehouse vendor and possibly other vendors to be determined in the future. The Port Authority Plan is a Point of Service plan available to a closed group of approximately 275 active employees and their dependents for a total population of approximately 550. The State of Delaware utilizes multiple electronic human resources prog rams, such as PeopleSoft, and vendor databases at separate locations in various formats to collect and store participant data. 2.0 Background Information Since July 1, 2007, the SEBC has contracted with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, now operating as Highmark Delaware, and Aetna as the Plan's third party medical claims administrator s. The SEBC is now issuing a bid for a third party medical claims administrator that can provide GHIP participants with improved care management and significant unit cost reduction and/or significant reductions in the total cost of care per member without sacrificing the quality of care delivered for a contract award effective July 1, 2017. While the effective date is July 1, 2017, firms are encouraged to propose or illustrate creative delivery strategies that may not be market ready for July 1, 2017 but may be within the terms of this agreement. The State would like to take bolder actions that focus on mitigating the total cost of care for both the GHIP and its participa nts while driving improvements in the health of the GHIP population. Therefore, the third party medical claims administrator (TPA) must be able to provide innovative cost containment features, including but not limited to centers of excellence, accountabl e care organizations and advanced primary care , to mitigate the high growth rates in GHIP expenditures over the last several years. In addition, the TPA must also have robust quality management processes in place to ensure that the providers participatin g in any cost containment program must meet strict quality guidelines. It will be favorable if firms can provide meaningful trend and cost guarantees with their proposal. As the SEBC is looking for a TPA that can drive meaningful changes in the health an d the cost of GHIP participants, requiring targeted interventions and care delivery strategies that are materially different from traditional health management programs and fee - for-service pricing offered by most TPA s, this RFP represents a significant departure from the requested scope of services covered in the last procurement of a TPA for the GHIP in 2011. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 12 One of SEBC's goals is to foster increased competition among TPAs and health insurers, by rewarding distinctiv e performance with increased membership. With this in mind, based on the competitiveness of proposals received from bidders in response to this RFP, the SEBC may make awards including but not limited to the following configurations: a. Award of one or more o f the plan options that are required by Delaware Code exclusively to a single TPA (different from the current practice for the HMO and CDHP), if one TPA is able to deliver a superior value proposition to SEBC members throughout Delaware b. Award of one or mor e plan options to one TPA for a limited geographic region, if able to deliver a superior value proposition; then a second TPA chosen either for the other geographic region(s) or as a statewide alternative c. Award of one or more plan options exclusively to on e TPA with a statewide network, wherein certain care management, provider risk -sharing, or other cost containment strategies may initially be restricted to a subset of the network, with a commitment to expand the reach of those cost containment strategies over time d. Award of a new plan option outside of those required by Delaware Code, if supported by proposals from one or more bidders that would deliver substantial savings and superior outcomes to both members and SEBC if widely adopted. The schematic below outlines several examples of care delivery models that are among the solutions that the SEBC would consider from bidders responding to this RFP. The key criteria for any of these models to work effectively, i.e., a TPA, a plan design and a network of one or more providers willing to contract for alternative reimbursement models, should be noted as it will be highly important for bidders' to respond with detailed descriptions of their capabilities to support each of these criteria. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 13 Note: It is possible that these value -based care delivery models may have a reimbursement model other than the predominant models listed above. TPAs will be considered to offer a stronger value proposition to the SEBC if they include contractual guarantees to migrate provider payments to value -based payment arrangements which promise or have the potential to reduce trend (or the growth rate in trend) for the SEBC and GHIP members while also maintaining or improving the quality of care. Below are examples of such arra ngements, beginning with those that would be considered most favorably: a. Existing contractual commitments or letter of intent between the TPA and network providers which include downside risk and upside sharing for managing the quality and total cost of car e: for all GHIP medical spending for all GHIP members of the TPA within Delaware. b. [Existing downside risk arrangement, as described above]: for a portion of GHIP spending, based on either select episodes of care or a subset of GHIP members of the TPA, base d, for example based on attribution to select primary care providers in the network. c. Commitment to introduce downside and upside risk sharing arrangements for some or all GHIP medical spending, including willingness of TPA to offer performance guarantees r elative to adoption. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 14 d. Existing contractual commitments between the TPA and network providers which include upside shared savings for managing the quality and total cost of care: for all GHIP members of the TPA within Delaware with future plans to put in som e down side risk commitments . e. [Existing upside shared savings arrangement, as described above]: for a portion of GHIP members that may be attributed to primary care providers participating in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) or Clinically Integrated Network for purposes of clinical integration and adoption of value -based payment. f. Commitment to introduce upside shared savings arrangements for some or all SEBC medical spending, including willingness of TPA to offer performance guarantees relative to adoption. In addition, the SEBC will consider more favorably TPA proposals that include cost containment strategies that promise to deliver savings to the SEBC and GHIP members, which may be prospectively forecasted by bidders, subject to actuarial review by the SEBC's benefits consultants, and which may be evaluated for performance on an annual basis. Following are examples of such strategies: a. Performance guarantees from TPAs that include downside risk for increases in total cost of care above historica l trends; b. Provider acceptance of downside risk arrangements that promise reductions in total cost of care or reduced rate of increase in total cost of care; c. Introduction of a narrow network for primary care, specialty care, hospital care, or care in one or more geographic regions, with projected reductions in total cost of care that have reasonable risk adjustment methods ; or d. Introduction of a high -performance network for primary care, specialty care, hospital care, or other care in one or more geographic regions, with reduced out - of-pocket cost sharing at the point of care to for members who seek care from providers within the high -performance network. GHIP Background Information The State of Delaware Group Health Insurance Program (GHIP) provides medical and prescription benefit coverage to over 122,000 covered lives. This includes approximately 31,000 active employees, 5,900 non -Medicare retirees and 17,000 Medicare retirees whose benefits are extended to their spouses and dependents. Als o, covered are approximately 18,000 employees, retirees and their dependents from groups that also participate in the GHIP as permitted through Delaware Code. As shown in Figure 1, active employees and dependents represent over 70% of the GHIP's population with retirees representing the remainder. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 15 The GHIP is self -insured and pays the actual claims (expenditures) incurred by the GHIP participants for services received under the health and prescription plans. Claim expenses represent approximately 96% of the GHIP's total expenditures. The SEBC is responsible for design of the plans available to the GHIP's participants and setting premium rates that can support the projected expenses of the GHIP. The percentage of employee and employer share of the premium rates is established in Delaware Code as are the actual plan offerings available to employees and retirees.4 Due to restrictions placed on the GHIP by the Delaware Code, the SEBC cannot employ one of the more traditional levers to manage cost, i.e., shi fting additional cost to plan participants through higher premium cost sharing (see chart below). Further, while increased cost sharing through plan design continues to be an option available to the SEBC, there has been limited support for increasing memb er out -of-pocket costs at the point of care, particularly in the absence of sufficient resources that would allow members to make an informed decision about their costs. The SEBC's efforts to promote additional health care consumerism have also been hinde red by the low enrollment in the GHIP consumer directed plan option (i.e., <5% of the covered population). Therefore, one of the goals of this RFP process is to identify a third party administrator with a robust set of health care cost and quality transpa rency tools that would supply plan participants with the information needed to make informed decisions about their health care. 4 Delaware Code, Title 29, Chapter 52 Web Address: http://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c052/index.shtml Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 16 *Retirees with full state share who retired before July 1, 2012 **Retirees with full state share who retired after July 1, 20 12 The active and non -Medicare populations have always paid the same premium rates for each plan; however, the actual claims (expenditures) of the non -Medicare retiree population are significantly higher than the active population as illustrated in the ch art below. The Medicare population receives secondary medical coverage through the GHIP as well as prescription drug benefits through an Employer Group Waiver Medicare Part D plan implemented in calendar year 2013. The premium rates for the Medicare popula tion are more closely aligned with the actual claims (expenditures) of the population. The following table outlines the actuarial value of each plan based upon in -network benefits as compared to a few sample plan designs available through the Marketplace. The State funds on average, 91.4% of the total premium of the plans.

Several points should be noted about the CDH Gold plans with an HRA: Members receive an annual contribution from the State to fund the HRA, in the amount of $1,250 for single coverage/$2,500 for family c overage The full amount of the annual HRA contribution is made available to members on the first day of the plan year (July 1) The HRA can be used to pay for medical expenses during the deductible period and/or to pay other out of pocket costs incurred by the member Prescription copays do not count toward the deductible or out -of-pocket maximums and are not eligible for payment using the HRA Any available HRA funds are automatically used when the third party administrators adjudicate medical claims. Members are responsible for any remaining balance owed to the medical provider, and will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Explanation of Payment (EOP) that shows any remaining payments required . It is the member's responsibility to follow -up with the provider to pay any remaining balance. Unused HRA funds will carry over to the next year as long as member remains enrolled in a Consumer -Directed Health Plan through the State of Delaware Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 18 When a new hire enrolls in a Consumer -Directed Health Plan outside of the annual enrollment process or an employee changes tier level mid -year (an example: from individual to family), the HRA is prorated in accordance with the effective date of the enrollment or change in tier level. The chart below provides the time periods and level of proration: Date of Enrollment or Tier Change HRA Fund per Individual HRA Fund per Family July 1 - September 30 $1,250 .00 $2,500 .00 October 1 - December 31 $937.50 $1,875 .00 January 1 - March 31 $625 .00 $1,250 .00 April 1 - June 30 $312.50 $625 .00 The deductible remains the same regardless of date of enrollment or tier change. Additional information about the CDH Gold Plan HRA fund end-of-plan year claim processing has been provided in Attachment 9. GHIP Historical Review Important to note is the passage of House Bill 81 during the 146th General Assembly5 in 2011. This legislation marked the first and only significant change in State employee and retiree benefits since the onset of rising healthcare costs experienced nationally at the turn of the century. It represented the collective work of the administra tion, legislature and unions representing the majority of State employees, all of whom recognized the changing landscape and financial hardships being faced by public sector employers with regards to controlling costs and preserving health and pension bene fits. The impetus behind House Bill 81 was the $80M deficit and contentious FY11 GHIP budget process. The cost sharing structure outlined previously was one of many outcomes of the legislation. Other changes included: Elimination of a free health plan re placed with a 4% cost share for employees and non - Medicare retirees enrolled in the First State Basic plan; A 5% cost share for Medicare ret irees enrolled in the Medicare S upplement plan who retired after July 1, 2012; Slight increases in the number of s ervice years required to vest for specific percentage of the State share for retiree health benefits; and The elimination of Double State Share for new employees as well as a flat $25 per month per contract for employees who remained eligible for Double S tate Share.6 5 The legislature meets on a part -time basis from January through June each year. 6 See 29 Del. C. \u00a7 5202(d) for complete details at http://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c052/index. shtml Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 19 Prior to the passage of House Bill 81, the SEBC's authority and responsibilities were the same; however, the absence of a set employee/retiree cost share left the SEBC with the added responsibility of balancing the GHIP budget through either plan design changes or increases in the employee/retiree share of the total premium rates. While House Bill 81 did make changes and accomplished the intended objective of bringing the State employee and retiree health benefits in line with what was more common in the public sector environment, the growth rates experienced by the GHIP have continued to far exceed the State Operating budget growth and without additional change, appear to be unsustainable. Expenditures accelerated in FY14 after two years of relatively stable per member costs; however, this was not confirmed until updated expenditure projections became available in early February 2015 and as the SEBC began to deliberate over options to balance the FY16 GHIP budget. The following table was used during discussions with the SEBC and exemplifies the dramatic uptick in per member per month (PMPM) costs. Source: Group Health FY15 Financial Reporting As the projected deficit rose to $116.3M, the increase provided in the Governor's 2016 recommended budget for FY16 fell $60M short of the amount needed to fund the premium rates at a level equal to the expected GHIP expenditures. A similar scenario to that which the SEBC experienced during the FY11 GHIP budget process emerged and it was not until additional money was appropriated by the Joint Finance Committee and approved by the legislature as part of the State Operating Budget process that the SEBC was able to approve a balanced budget for FY16. Employee and retiree healthcare was the larg est cost driver in the State Operating Budget for FY16 . Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 20 Included in epilogue in the FY16 Operating Budget bill was language requiring the formation of the State Employees Health Plan Task Force to study the State Group Health Plan with the purpose of finding cost savings and efficiencies. The Task Force met thr ough the fall of CY2015 and issued a report to the Governor and General Assembly on December 16, 2015. Minutes and meeting materials from the seven meetings of the Task Force as well as the final Task Force Report are available for review at http://ben.omb.delaware.gov/hptf/index.shtml . The report focuses on several short -and-long term actions for considerations, which are segmented by the following categories: 1. Bending the cost curve 2. Exploring o pportunities to realign provider payments 3. Benchmarking GHIP plans and costs on a comparable basis 4. Improving the health of the population According to the report7, the State of Delaware's health risk in 2014 was higher than the nationwide average, indicating a higher than average illness burden in the State of Delaware population8. Additionally, the risk score of the population increased 20% for 2014 versus 2013. Another concerning finding from this report indicated that the State's prevalence for key chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension were approximately 10% greater in the GHIP population compared to the state benchmark. The presentation of the Delaware Center for Health Innovation (DCHI) also commented that the health of the enti re state demographics contribute to the issue. As a result, a key recommendation of this report was that the State should leverage the significant contribution the GHIP makes to Delaware hospitals' revenue to support quicker adoption of changes including provider incentives such as pay for performance and/or bundled or episodic payments that balance lower costs with improving quality of care and patient outcomes, and that any exploration should recognize and coordinate with findings of the DCHI. In Februa ry of 2013, CMMI awarded Delaware a \"design\" grant, which funded the development of the State Health Care Innovation Plan. The State applied for a SIM \"testing\" grant in July of 2014 to support the implementation and testing of the plan. The goal is the \" Triple Aim\" - improving the health of Delawareans, improving the patient experience of care, and reducing health care costs. Through the SIM initiative, Delaware is planning to build upon a strong local foundation for innovation in order to achieve this through a system -level transformative healthcare plan that can serve as a scalable model for the nation. The State aspires to develop and implement a plan for broad -based health system transformation, including new payment and delivery models, which will ach ieve the Triple Aim. 7 Final Report of the State Employees Health Plan Task Force, December 15, 2015, is at: http://ben.omb.delaware.gov/hptf/documents/task -force -report.pdf . 8 Data reported by Truven Health Analytics, the data warehouse to the GHIP. Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 21 The health transformation approach is organized into several workstreams, with two that most closely dovetail with the goals of this RFP: delivery system transformation and payment model reform . These workstreams have the goal of improving the delivery system to encourage \"smarter\" consumption and production of care and to change the focus of the State of Delaware from sickness to wellness. The State Health Care Innovation Plan describes each wor kstream in further detail and can be read in its entirety here: http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhcc/cmmi/files/choosehealthplan.pdf . Since July 2014, the DCHI has been convening stakeholders to establish goals for primary care transformation as a key element of Delaware's Health Innovation Plan, contributing to broader aspirations for improved health, health care quality and experience, and affordability for all Delawareans. While the DCHI's early work has focused on primary care, in the future it aims to build on this foundation with improved behavioral health and specialty care, as well as better integration among primary care, behavioral health, and specialty care. DCHI has achiev ed multi -stakeholder consensus on important elements related to Delaware's strategy to transition to statewide adoption of value -based payment and care delivery models. These include topics related to primary care practice transformation, care coordination , the integration of behavioral health with primary care, outcomes -based payment for population health management, and a proposed governance model by which Healthy Neighborhoods may organize to integrate public health, health care delivery, and community -based efforts to improve population health.9 The DCHI was also tasked with implementing Delaware's State Health Care Innovation Plan catalyzed by the State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative, a national grant program administered by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). The goal of the SIM initiative is to support states to move toward value -based payment models and to improve population health. One of the main tenets of Delaware's State Health Care Innovation Plan is to assist hosp itals and other providers in building infrastructure t o accept financial risk for health care costs over time . The speed and degree of risk will largely depend on hospital and provider readiness ( i.e. integration of care between PCP, specialists and facil ities, evidence based practices and feedback systems , the strength of EMR records sharing, and ability to use data in clinical transformation efforts) . Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) The SEBC expects that the third party administrator (s) selected from this RFP will be an active participant in these efforts, including participating in the Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) to create a single interface for providers and patients to access health information that supports care coordi nation, performance reviews and patient engagement. 9 For further information about the DCHI, please visit http://www.dehealthinnovation.org/Health -Innovation . Delaware RFP for a Medical Thir d Party Administrator for the GHIP 22 The DHIN is a statutorily created not -for-profit instrumentality of the State of Delaware charged with the design, implementation, operation and maintenance of facilities for public and private use of health care information in the State. Specifically, the DHIN is the state - designated health information exchange (\"HIE\") and under that statute is charged with operating a statewide integrated health information network to enable communication of clinica l and financial health information, to promote the efficient and effective communication among Delaware health care providers and stakeholders including hospitals, physicians, state agencies, payers, employers and laboratories, with the goal of promoting e fficiencies in the healthcare delivery system. The DHIN is nationally recognized in the rapidly growing and dynamic field of health information exchanges (HIEs). Launched in 2007, DHIN is the longest operating statewide HIE. It is designed as an interoperable network to exchange clinical information among all health care providers across the state to improve patient outcomes and patient -provider relationships. The system is designed to allow patient clinical information to be shared across all hea lth care facilities and organizations and across public and private sectors. It has been built through a consensus process among the health care stakeholders, which has resulted in an exceptionally high participation rate: All of Delaware's acute care hosp itals actively participate in the DHIN . All three of Delaware's Federally Qualified Health Centers exclusively receive clinical results via DHIN. Over 80% of Delaware's health care providers are receiving clinical results via DHIN. 90% of Delaware resident s have clinical information available for query through DHIN. 80% of laboratory tests ordered or performed in Delaware are reported through DHIN. The DHIN has also been tasked with housing and managing the Delaware All Payer Claims Database (APCD), which Governor Markell signed into law as Senate Bill 238 on July 21, 2016. Further details on the APCD can be found on the DHIN website : http://dhin.org/ . B.
