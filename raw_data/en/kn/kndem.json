Understanding the history of the Health Commission is a key component in this process. History gives useful context to current public health issues and policies. In addition to the offic ial orientation process facilitated by the Executive Secretary, senior Health Commission members often share information with newer members as a way to pass down the Commission's history. Edward Chow MD, is the longest serving Health Commissioner. First ap pointed in 1989, he has been an active force in providing guidance to the San Francisco Department of Public Health through many years of its successes and challenges. For many, he holds the history of the Health Commission, and has functioned as an effect ive mentor to those who have served during his long tenure . His numerous contributions to the Health Commission and the San Francisco Department of Public have impacted the City's public health and health care policy, practice, and systems , for decades. In 2017 Dr. Chow requested that a written document be developed to assist new Commissioners to better understand the Commission's history. The purpose of this document is provide an overview and brief history of the San Francisco Health Commission to new Health Commissioners and new SFPDH Executive Staff . It is dedicated to those who have served , those who are currently serving, and those who will serve in the future as Health Commissioners. Thank you all for your time, dedication, and many contributions to the health and wellbeing of all San Franciscans. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 4 FIRST ITERATION OF THE HEALTH COMMISSION A Commission of Health was convened in the early part of the 20th Century. However, no City documents are available to give specific information regarding this Commission's jurisdiction , function, and actions. The City Charter was amended in 193 2 to give authority to the San Francisco Chief Administrative Officer over San Francisco City Departments, including the Department of Public Health (SFDPH) . Thus, the Health Commission was no longer necessary and was dissolved . This change was made to combat Mayoral corruption and eliminate politics from the oversight of the SFDPH . This amendment of the Charter instituted the following structure: The Chief Administrative Officer, appointed by the Mayor for an unlimited tenure, appointed a Director of Health, who was charged to govern all aspects of the Department of Public Health. The Board of Supervisors was considered to be the ultimate governing body of the SFDPH and its hospitals, through the Chief Administrative Officer position. The Chief Administrative Officer appointed an Assistant Director of Public Health for Hospital Ser vices, who oversaw both San Francisco General Hospital and Laguna Honda Hospital. The Chief Administrative Officer appointed a seven member Health Advisory Board that reported on matters related to the SFDPH to the Director of Health and the City Administr ator. This advisory board went out of existence a decade before calls for a Health Commission resurgence in 1984. ISSUES THAT LED TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE HEALTH COMMISSION In 1983 and 1984, San Francisco General Hospital's (SFGH) accreditation by the Jo int Commission, the national non -profit that certifies hospitals, was in jeopardy. The Joint Commission indicated that SFGH did not have an effective governing body, had antiquated management systems, and staffing shortages. In addition to these accreditation issues , there were also problems with ambulance response times and overall ambula nce services in San Francisco. At the time , many in the community also felt the City's mental health system was not responsive to the changing needs of the diverse San Francisco communities . In 1984, the AIDS crisis was raging in San Francisco. Members of the community wanted assurance that the SFDPH could and would continue to respond to the growing needs of the communities impacted by HIV/AIDS . The public also wanted to know that it had a venue to give input and feedback to the SFDPH regarding all of its services. A City Charter Amendment was proposed for the 1984 local elec tions to create a Health Commission to serve as the governing body of the SFDPH, including SFGH and Laguna Honda (LHH) Hospital s. This organizational structure also enabled the public to give input on all business related to SFDPH, including policy decisio ns related to both SFGH and LHH. The Health Commission would make budget and policy decisions more transparent because most of the Commission's business would be conducted in public meetings. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 5 CREATION OF THE MODERN DAY HEALTH COMMISSION In January 15, 1985, the modern -day Health Commission held its first meeting . The resur rection of this Commission was the result of the 1984 Proposition C initiative that changed the City Charter to assign the governance of the San Francisco Department of Pu blic Health (SFDPH) to the Health Commission . The Health Commission's responsi bilities included appointing a Director of Health; setting policy and monitoring the budget for matters pertaining to the preservation, promotion, and protection of the lives, health, and mental health of San Francisco residents. The SFDPH Director of Health was given the responsibil ity of managing the daily operations of the SFDPH and having oversight of all SFDPH administrative activities. The newly ratified City Charter amendment charged the Mayor with appointing seven Health Commissioners for four year terms ; the Board of Superv isors were given authority to ratify the Mayor's appointments. CITY CHARTER SECTIONS RELATED TO THE HEALTH COMMISSION : Note: in 1995, the City Charter was amended and Charter language regarding the Health Commission was refined. However, the changes did not alter the Health Commission's authority or duties. The following are City Charter passages from the current (1995) City Charter relevant to the Health Commission's role, authority, and duties: 4.110 The Health Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by the Mayor, pursuant to Section 3.100 , for four -year terms.

The Commission shall control the property under its jurisdiction. The Commission and the Department shall manage and control the City and County hospitals, emergency medical services, and in general provide for the preservation, promotion and protection of th e physical and mental health of the inhabitants of the City and County, except where the Charter grants such authority to another officer or department. The Commission and the Department may also determine the nature and character of public nuisances and p rovide for their abatement. 4.102 SEC. 4.102. BOARDS AND COMMISSION - POWERS AND DUTIES.

No person serving on a board or c ommission c reated by state law to discharge a state function specifically within the City and County may be employed as a paid staff member to a board or commiss ion created by this Charter. THE 1985 HEALTH COMMISSION : When Mayor Dianne Feinstein appointed the first seven Health Commissioners in 1985, she outlined the following priorities: \"First, to review the past accreditation problems of the San Francisco General Hospital, and to work to see that other such problems do not present themselves in the future.\" \"Secondly, to deal effectively with the major public health problem of AIDS, carefully monitoring and reviewing developments from a public hea lth perspective. \" (Note: She began a Health Commission tradition of appointing a person living with HIV to the Commission. Since then, there has been a seat on the Health Commission reserved for a person living with HIV .) \"Thirdly, to improve the City's ability to provide mental health care.\" \"Finally, to rapidly improve the City's emergency services.\" 1985 HEALTH COMMISSIONER S Dr. Phillip Lee, who was at the time, Director of The Institute for Health Policy Studies and Co -Director of the Aging Health Policy Center in the School of Nursing at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine. He was elected th e first president of the Health Commission and was very important in shaping its processes and internal culture. Dr. Richard Sanchez, who was at the time, Chief of Pediatrics and Board Member of St. Luke's Hospital and clinical faculty at UCSF Medical Cen ter. John Blumein, who was at the time, a noted financial expert with Sutro and Co. and who previously served as president and budget chair of the Commission on Aging. Naomi Gray, who was at the time, a program and management consultant , Chair of the Mayo r Task Force on Public Housing and Health Benefits , and member of the UCSF Hospital Associates Board Rosabelle Tobriner, who was at the time, a member of the Health Care Advisory Committee of the SFDPH and had previously served as director of Mount Zion Ho spital. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 8 Dr. Y Clement Shek, a practicing dentist who served on the boards of the Chinatown Community Children's Center and the Chinatown Resources Development Center. James M. Foster, was a consultant in government relations and a former Elections Commiss ioner. He addressed the 1972 Democratic National Convention as the first openly gay person to do so. He later became an AIDS activist after being diagnosed. The Health Commissioners appointed in 1985 set a tone for the culture of the Commission that conti nues today. Individual Health Commissioners remain responsive to their own communities while addressing the public health issues for all San Franciscans. The Commission provides guidance and input to the SFPDH regarding policy direction , but relies on the Director of Health to administer and operate the Department. Please see Appendix A for a list of all individuals who have served on the Health Commission. The Work of the Health Commission: Since 1985, the Health Commission has worked with seven Di rectors of Health and thousands of San Francisco Department of Public Health staff to carry out its duties . Its work encompasses an enormous range of topics. To fulfill its responsibilitie s as governing body of SFDPH , the Health Commission conducts the following activities and actions: Reviewing a wide range of SFDPH programs and public health topics to monitor the San Francisco Health Network medical care system and Population Health public health programs ; Approve and monitor SFDPH budget s and contracts ; Approve SFDPH Policy; Approve resolutions pertinent to public health policy and/or to honor those who have contributed to the public health community; Through the Joint Conference Committees, monitor quality programs and approve medical s taff credentialing at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, Laguna Honda Hospital, and the SFDPH primary care clinics; Supervise and provide guidance to the Director of Health and the Health Commission Executive Secretary; Hold Proposition Q Hearings to determine if proposed medical service closures at local hospitals and/or medical centers will be detrimental to the health of San Franciscans; Through its public me etings, provide a forum for members of the community to provide comment on public health issues and policy. Please see Appendix I for a full list of Health Commission resolutions from 1985 through 2018 . A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 9 The issues listed below were identified by current and former Health Commissioners as significant areas of accomplishment. HIV/AIDS Upon its inception in 1985, the Health Commission w orked closely with the SFDPH to give the SFDPH authority to establish prevention, treatment , research, and surveillance systems to address the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco. It also supported state and federal advocacy efforts for HIV/AIDS prevention, research, and treatment. The year before the creation of the modern Health Commission, the San Francisco Health Department, under the leadership of Dr. Mervyn Silverman, closed 14 bathhouses and sex clubs catering to men who have sex with men in San Francisco. At the time, there were 723 known cases of HIV in San Francisco; the SFDPH predicted that up to 100,000 residents in San Fran cisco may have alrea dy been infected with HIV. The b athhouse owners and gay male community fought these closures in court. The result was a court order to allow the businesses to remain open but to require all doors to be removed to ensure no private space s where \"high risk behavior\" could take place; staff also had to monitor the premises every ten minutes to ensure patrons were adhering to the rules. The SFDPH worked with community agencies (e.g. San Francisco AIDS Foundation) and bathhouse owners to prov ide monitoring guidelines. A newly formed SFDPH AIDS Office eventually became responsible for all non -medical HIV/AIDS activities conducted by the SFDPH, including surveillance, research, administration, coordination of non -acute care services, coordinati on of prevention efforts, and policy development. During the last half of the 1980s, the AIDS Office grew rapidly, and an increasing number of contracts were awarded to community based organizations to d eliver a wide range of services for people living wit h HIV and for prevention activities. Initially, the AIDS Office staff decided on their own which vendors were chosen due the crisis situation . Over time formal Request for Proposal procedures were developed to ensure a fair process was used to contract out City funds. In 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White CARE Act, which provided substantial federal funds for a wide range of services for people living with HIV including: medical, substance use treatment, mental health counseling, peer support, housing, ca se management, benefits counseling, alternative therapies, medication, and respite care. An important function of the Health Commission was to approve the many contracts with community vendors who provided much of the HIV/AIDS prevention and care services in San Francisco. The robust reviews of these contracts in public meetings afforded the C ommissioners an opportunity to closely monitor the HIV service system and receive input from the community regarding any gaps in services. As federal HIV funding has decreased, the Health Commission has strongly advocated for the City to backfill funds to ensure the continuum of HIV services in San Francisco continues to meet the needs of San Francisco residents. Through its long -term support of SFDPH's innovative harm reduction policies and programs, such as : needle exchange, medical marijuana, Pre-exposu re Prophylaxis (PrEP) and more recently, safe injection sites, the Health Commission has supported groundbreaking efforts to A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 10 increase the quality of life for those at risk for contracting and/or infected with HIV and Hepatitis C. In 2010, the Health Commi ssion supported the SFDPH and UCSF's efforts to dramatically improve HIV treatment methodology. \"Test and Treat,\" was a strategy to recommend that treatment of HIV should begin when an individual is confirmed to be infected. Prior to this paradigm, medical providers waited for a patient 's CD4 count to drop below 350, indicating a compromise of the immune system, before anti -retroviral treatment was begun. The clinical success of th e SFDPH's efforts led to a worldwide chan ge of practice of treating HIV. Through its request to review annual data on HIV and STDs, the Health Commission supports the \"Getting to Zero\" initiative, which the SFDPH co -leads. This effort strives to end HIV -related stigma in addition to reducing new HIV infections and HIV -related deaths by 90% , by 2020 . The Getting to Zero RAPID, Rapid Anti -Retroviral Therapy Program, Initiative recommends starting anti-retroviral therapy within 48 hours after an individual te sts positive for HIV with acute infection or evidence of advanced infection; anti -retroviral therapy is begun at five days for all other types of newly diagnosed HIV infection s. Healthy San Francisco In 2006 and 2007, the Health Commission provided guidan ce, heard public input, and monitored the development of Healthy San Francisco (HSF) , which was developed under the guidance of Director of Health, Mitch Katz MD, and Deputy Director, Tangerine Brigham. Prior to the implementation of HSF, the lack of adequate access to health care motivated many uninsured and under insured individuals and families to utilize hospital emergency departments for their medical care needs. This put a strain on the Ci ty's safet y net health care system which consis ted of community health clinics and San Francisco General Hospital ; other local hospitals' emergency departments were also heavily utilized by this population. Mayor Gavin Newsom and Supervisor Tom Ammiano both developed separate proposals to expand healthcare coverage to help provide avenues of health care coverage for the thousands of uninsured San Franciscans. Supervisor Ammiano's legislation focused on an employer health spending mandate. The Mayor appo inted a Universal Healthcare Council which recommended expanding access to health care. The two initiatives were combined in the San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance which was adopted by the Board of Supervisors in August 2006. In July, 2007, the Health Commission passed a resolution approving the Healthy San Francisco regulations which governed how the program was to be operated including program definitions, eligibility, fee structure, services, delivery network, administration protocols, and reporting schedule. The program began enrolling participants at the SFDPH Chinatown Health Center in July 2007. Health y San Francisco initially focused on increasing accessible and affordable healthcare provision to adult uninsured San Fra ncisco residents. It bridged the existing health care safety A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 11 net of public and non -profit providers to improve health care utilization and quality of care. An important aspect of the program was the establishment of a medical home for each patient. This provided opportunity for each enrolled individual to have access to preventative care and wellness checks in addition to care for acute issues. The program continues to strive to improve health care utilization and quality of care. HSF was initially financed through a combination of the City and County of San Francisco funds , other public sources , and contributions from participants and employers. The program leveraged state and federal funding that supported services to uninsured persons. To support HSF, the SFDPH received a three -year funding award from the federal government under the Health Care Coverage Initiative . The Health Commission closely monitored budget initiatives and the effectiveness of fiscal systems related to the program. The Golden Gate Restaurant Association filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Healthy San Francisco policy requiring large businesses to provide health insurance for their employees, pay into a citywide healthcare fund , or contribute to employees' health savings account . The Health Commission closely monitored this legal case. San Francisco won its arguments in May 2009 and an appeal to the United States Supreme Court was declined in 2010. This enabled the program to continue with no further legal obstacl es. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was pass ed by Congress and was implemented in 2014. It expanded Med -Cal to single adults ages 19 -64 years . During the next several years, the Health Commission closely monitored and gave guidance as the SFDPH de veloped pathways to transition many of the Healthy San Francisco participants to healthcare coverage through Medi -Cal expansion. Through several resolutions during 2014 and 201 5, the Health Commission approved the following HSF policy changes: Removal of the age limit , which enabled adults 65 years and older to be eligible for HSF if they meet all other criteria. Extension of the HSF transition period , which was in response to concerns about the cost of subsidized health insurance under the ACA. Removal of the requirement to show HSF program ineligibility in order to request HSF for Medical Reimbursement Account transfer. This allowed employees participating in the City Option program who request a transfer of money from their HSF account to an MRA to no longer be required to show they are ineligible for HSF, which promoted used of the City Option MRA funds towards insurance premiums. Create SF Covered MRA Program, which provides for health insurance premium and cost-sharing assistance for eligible employees receiving employer contributions to the City Option. This program ensures that low and moderate -income San Franciscans have access to affordable health care. In response to the current federal administration's attempts to decrease the effectiveness of the ACA, the SFDPH has prepared for a possible increase in Healthy San Francisco enrollees who may lose all or a portion of health insurance coverage if MediCal exp ansion eligibility changes . A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 12 The Health Commission continues to closely monitor and provide guidance regarding these SFDPH policy responses to federal policy changes . Laguna Honda Hospital and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Rebuild Projects The City Charter authorizes the Health Commission, acting through the SFDPH Director of Health , to manage and control the City -owned hospitals. Since 1985, both ZSFG and LHH have had major capit al projects t o rebuild main hospital buildings. Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center (LHH) The Department of Justice (DOJ) was granted court appointed oversight of LHH beginning in 1998 due to policies and practices which failed to place patients in the most integrated s etting suitable to their needs. In a 1997 report, th e DOJ recommended changes to LHH practices , including improved supervision and management programs, especially regarding abuse and neglect; and enhanced he alth care access. T he DOJ report also recommended increased number of staff and more effective staff training and supervision. The full Health Commission, and its LHH Joint Conference Committee, closely monitored activities at LHH as the hospital worked to rectify issues noted in the DOJ report and subsequent monitoring updates. The DOJ released LHH from its oversight in 2011 after many changes were made at LHH. The SFDPH proposed building new hospital buildings to mitigate the issues noted by DOJ and meet state seis mic regulations for hospitals. In 1999, San Francisco voters passed Proposition A, which allowed for the City to use a comb ination of loans and Tobacco Settlement funds to build new hospital buildings on the Laguna Honda Hospital campus to replace existing buildings which were built betwee n 1926 and 1940. Many of the buildings were damaged in the 1989 earthquake and most of th e campus utility and safety systems were in dire need of replacement. The Health Commission closely monitored the LHH Rebuild including the project timeline and budget, through monthly reports made to the LHH JCC and quarterly reports to the full Health Commission. As the number or change orders for the construction project increased, a report on these requests and associated costs was submitted to the LHH JCC on a regular basis. The large capital project originally had a projected end date of 2006 but due to a steep rise in steel costs and numerous unanticipated change order s, the project was not completed until 2010. The project was reduced from 1,250 beds to 780 beds and ran $183 million over the original budget. The Health Commission directed the SFDPH leadership to analyze the project for lessons learned so that it could stay within budget and timelines for future capital projects. The final project included t wo new residential towers along with a pavilion building, which bridges the two towers with the older Administration building. Renovations were also completed on 150,000 square feet of space in existing LHH buildings. The new residential buildings replaced the dorm -style rooms wit h a new concept for mixing privacy and community together to enhance a patient's experience. Shared rooms are now organized into households for 15 residents; each household has its own dining room and living room. There are private rooms and shared rooms w ith 2 or 3 patients. Four households on each floor comprise a A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 13 neighborhood of 60 patients. The new hospital is LEED certified and uses 30% less energy than is required by the building code. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) In 2008, the pu blic voted to approve Proposition A to rebuild San Francisco General Hospital. The older hospital buildi ngs built between 1915 and 1972 d id not meet state seismic regulations. The Health Commission closely monitored the SFGH Rebuild including the project timeline and budget, through monthly reports made to the SFGH JCC and quarterly reports to the full Health Commission. After the LHH Rebui ld Project, the SFDPH adopted new capital project management procedures to increase pre -construction planning efforts and ensure a more stringent review process for change orders in an effort to keep the project on budget and on time. During construction, the SFDPH worked closely with the SFGH Foundation to raise funds for the furniture, fixtures, and equipment, which were not covered by public bond funds. Through this highly successful campaign, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife , Priscilla Chan, a physician who trained at SFGH, donated $75 million. The Health Commission passed a resolution to accept the gift and to re commend to the Board of Supervisors that the hospital be renamed the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to rename the hospital in March 2015. In the summer of 2015, six months before the end of construction of the new building, Sue Currin, ZSFG CEO, resigned. Roland Pickens, Director of the San Francisco Health Network, took on the role of Acting CEO until Susan Ehrlich MD was hired in January, 2016. Dr. Ehrlich oversaw the final regulatory approvals, planning for services to move, and patient transfers to the new building. The final seismically safe, acute hospital building was completed in December 2015. The project stayed within its projected budget and time line. The Health Commission joined Mark Zuckerberg and City and UCSF Officials in the ribbon cutting ceremony in December 2015. The building opened for patient services in s pring 2016. Governing Body of ZSFG and LHH Since its resurgence in 1985, the Healt h Commission has served as Governing Body at both ZSFG and LHH . Each hospital is required by its license to have a Governing Body which ensures that each facility is operated in accordance with the City Charter, the State of California, and Federal regulations. To fulfill this requirement, the Health Commission appoints three Commissioners as members of the Joint Conference Committee (JCC) of each hospital. The C ommission President chooses one of the Commission members to serve as JCC chair. Each JCC meets monthly to conduct its A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 14 business. The purpose of each JCC is to provide a systematic and effective mechanism for communication and review related to credentialin g, quality assurance, performance improvement, and patient safety matters between members of the Governing Body, Director of Health, the San Francisco Health Network Director, Hospital Administration, and Medical Staff. The leadership and participation of the Health Commissioners on the JCC also makes certain that members of the public can attend, hear open session business, and give input through public comment opportunities. Through the JCCs the Health Commission as a whole has been able to monitor and g ive guidance on issues that have been paramount to each hospital: SFGH quality and administrative issues that impacted accreditation of the hospital in 1984 : The first Health Commission, through the SFGH JCC, closely monitored the work conducted by the Director of Health to ensure the hospital came into compliance. This included changing the organizational structure of the hospital and hiring a new Chief Hospit al Admin istrator to implement a new management configuration and quality assurance programs. LHH quality and administrative issues that led to the Department of Justice over sight of the hospital : The Health Commission, through the JCC, closely monitored and provided input to the LHH adminis tration as it moved toward a paradigm of placing patients at the level of care most suitable to them. This required increasing the number of community discharges versus long -term stays. LHH administrative issues that l ed to mismanagement of the LHH Gift Fund in 2010: After a whistleblower brought issue s regarding the management of the Gift Fund to the attention of the Health Commission, an audit by the Controller was conducted. Findings indicated that LHH administration mishandled several hundred thousand dollars. This included misspending approximately $25,000 on sta ff trainings. The Health Commission, through the LHH JCC, closely monitored the progress LHH made, with the assistance of the SFDPH Chief Financial Officer, to develop stronger fiscal policies and practices for the Fund. The LHH JCC continues to receive qu arterly reports on LHH Gift Fund revenue and expenditures. The full Health Commission must approve the annual LHH Gift Fund budget and the LHH JCC must approve any expenditure not included on approved budget. Regulatory Surveys results : Throughout the year, e ach hospital participates in several mandatory regulatory surveys which include monitoring visits by a team to rate one of the hospital's specific service. Often the surveys are unannounced and take several days to complete. Any surve y findings indicate improvement is needed. Each of the hospital's JCC receives a report of the survey findings along with the hospital's draft response and action plan . The JCC monitors the hospital's progress to rectify the issues identified in the survey . Sentinel Events : In closed session at each JCC, the Health Commission members hear reports of sentinel events, which are any unanticipated incident resulting in death or serious physical or psychological injury to a patient . The reports also include a root -A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 15 cause analysis which list systemic issues that contributed to the event. A plan to rectify these issues in an effort to prevent similar incidents is also included in the report. The JCC then monitors the progress of the hospital in implement ing its improvement plan.

Mark Morewitz A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 19 APPENDIX E COMMENTS FROM FORMER HEALTH COMMISSIONER S The following were synthesized from comments submitted from former Health Commissioners. Orientation: New Health Commissioners should be assigned a mentor who has familiarity with the Commission. This practice, in addition to the formal orientation administered by the Health Commission Executive Secretary, could help new Health Commissioners more effectively acclimate to their role. Health Commission Officers Former Commissioners honor the extra work and time that Officers contribute duri ng their tenure. Officers have a duty to consistently pass along relevant information from regularly scheduled private meetings with the Director of Health to other Commissioners. This ensures all Health Commissioners are uniformly kept updated on import ant issues. Health Commission leadership should maintain neutrality and be careful not to become part \"of the system.\" Health Commissioners need a better understanding of their role so they can full y realize the potential of the Commission . Health Commission leadership can assist with this process. The Health Commission should take an active role in setting policy and strategic visions instead of simply responding to the work of the SFDPH. Health Commission leadership is encouraged to full y empower new He alth Commissioners so they do not simply learn to fit into the existing culture. The Health Commission needs to grow and evolve as new Commissioners are appointed. General Positive Feedback: All w ho responded were proud of their contributions to the San Francisco community. All who responded felt the Health Commission had an effective working relationship with the Director of Healt h during their tenure. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH COMMISSION 20 Former Health Commissioners felt they learn ed personally and professionally from their colleagues on the Commission. General Constructive Feedback: The Health Commission can more effectively encourage the SFDPH to work with other cities/jurisdictions to find effective solutions to local issues. The Health Commission needs more staffing resources to do its own research in best practices instead of exclusively hearing the SFDPH perspective on important public health issues. The Community and Public Health Committee (established in 2009) should hea r and discuss outcome data from the SFDPH non -hospital programs. APPENDIX F COMMENTS FROM A FORM ER HEALTH COMMISSION SECRETARY Sandi Mori, Health Commission Executive Secretary for 17 years, gave the following comments for new Health Commissioners: Have an open and productive working relationship with the Director of Health in order to thoroughly discuss and consider public health issues. Read all of your meeting materials and be prepared for meetings so you can inhabit your role as Health Commissioner effectively. Feel free to ask questions during meetings and for information before or after meetings if you would like a follow -up to an i tem. The Health Commission Executive Secretary is your staff resource to ensure you have the information and materials necessary for each meeting.
