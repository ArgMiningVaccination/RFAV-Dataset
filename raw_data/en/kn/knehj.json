In Brazil, vaccine hesitancy growing since 2015, disinformation was already presented, but it was not the main factor that led the population not to get vaccinated. The infodemic have changing the circulating narratives and impacting people's perceptions, attitudes, behaviors and it allowed antivaxxers groups to be structured in the country, which was not the case before. The denialism stance on covid-19, minimalizing its severity and supporting ineffective treatments, in addition to the government's discourses against covid-19 vaccines contributed to a scenario where risk factors for vaccine hesitancy prevailed. Social listening and infodemic insights use an integrated method for public health analysis and insights generation to inform evidence-driven infodemic interventions. But, what happens when public authorities are the main driver of misinformation? The government cannot be expected to play this role when he is the biggest misinformation creator. Case 1 - When the availability of covid-19 vaccines was announced globally, the Brazilian authorities (who had not yet placed an order for a vaccine) start to generate distrust in the vaccines. Pressured by the discontent of the population, Brazilian authorities increases his denialist discourse, defending and formally distributing kits of ineffective medicines; announcing that no one would be forced or be pressured to get vaccinate, and promising that they would not buy the vaccine if the industry did not take, in writing, responsibility for the vaccine adverse events and also created a document in which the population should sign, taking responsibility for choosing to be vaccinated. But, with the highest number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths recorded in the country and, therefore, a high perception of risk by the population, nothing was able to prevent Brazilians from getting vaccinated, except the lack of vaccines. Case 2 - Adolescent vaccination started in the country before it was recommended by the Ministry of Health. On September 15, 2021, the date set by the Ministry of Health to start the adolescents vaccination, the minister, himself announced on the traditional medea, a death coused by the vaccine however, the causal relationship had already been ruled out. And, so, because this death, he recommended the suspension of the vaccination of adolescents who do not have comorbidities. On September 20, 5 days after, the minister tries to explain himself, on the traditional media, not denAying the relationship of the death of the adolescent and the vaccine but saying that adverse Event \"does not invalidate\" vaccination of adolescents. Fortunately, on this occasion, about 80% of adolescents are already vaccinated. Case 3 - The case in which \"finally\" the antivaxxers Succeeded. In a scenario on what medical societies and the population criticize the government's delay in deciding on the vaccination for children from 5 to 11 years of age, on December 23, 2021, the Ministry of Health decides to hold an online public consultation to find out whether or not the population would be in favor of vaccinating children. But, after the population expressed approval for children vaccination: anti-vaxxers are greeted by the president for an official closed-door meeting; and, for the first time in Brazil, a public audience about vaccination is held. On January 4, 2022, the Ministry of Health promotes a public hearing on the vaccination of children and invites representatives of the Technical advisory committee for immunization in Covid-19, including me, to present their arguments, but, they also invited four doctors against vaccination to presenting their arguments too. Since that occurrence, anti-vaxxers have gained space and credibility, and start to destroying the perception of risk for covid-19 disease in children (who had, at Brazil, a lethality rate of least 5 times more than in rich countries) andreal videos are falsely related to the death of children caused by covid-19 vaccine. What was it the impact of this misinformation on adherence to covid-19 vacines? During the worst moments of the pandemic that killed 1 to 4 thousand people a day, which was announced daily by the traditional media, the vaccine adhesion was great in Brazil: currently: 94% of those over 40 years of age, 85% of those aged between 18 and 39 years and 80% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years received two doses. However, coverage for the second dose for children are 7% between 6 months and 2 years of age; 17% among children aged 3 and 4 years and 55% for those between 5 and 11 years. What was the impact of non-adhesion to vaccination in children from 6 months to 11 years? In Brazil, between the end of 2022 and until now, children, especially those under one year old, were the only age groups with an increase in cases, hospitalizations and deaths from covid-19. What ethical and legal concerns does Social listening (#sociallistening) in response to a serious health threat give raises to? Fundamentally rights and freedoms can not taken from these people, but the right to scientific and true information should be guaranteed for the population. And this can save lives of many people! Guidelines in the hands of health authorities responsible for managing the infodemic may allow for better outcomes and lower risk of intensional or non-intensional errors. #sociallistening in the hands of people or institutions with financial, political, public authorities, health professionals and other goals that lead them to destroy people's trust in science, can kill. And have killed during the covid-19 pandemic. "}
