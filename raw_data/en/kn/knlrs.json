Liber Amicorum 63-87. 28 2.1 Introduction: Paracelsus, his Life and Holistic Approach More than five hundred years ago, Theophrastus Bomb astus von Hohenheim (1493- 1541), who called himself Paracelsus, was born at E insiedeln (Switzerland) as the son of a German physician and chemist, Wilhelm Bomb ast von Hohenheim. Today, his achievements in the areas of medicine, philosop hy, linguistics, and theology are widely acknowledged. Many of the works by Paracelsu s have been published posthumously. Only between 1549 and 1658, 175 editi ons appeared. The research by Karl Sudhoff, who edited fourteen volumes of his medical and philosophical work created a scientific basis for further investigatio n. 1 For his social-political writings he is less well known, because this work has been foun d very late in order to be included in the complete Paracelsus edition. 2 It contains his contributions to comprehensive health sciences and health economic a spects, which are the focus of this chapter. Paracelsus received his early education from his fa ther. At the age of sixteen he went to Basel University, but soon abandoned his st udies at Basel for the study of chemistry and alchemy under Withemina, the Bishop o f W\u00fcrzburg. He continued his studies in T\u00fcbingen, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Vienna an d Ferrara. In 1515 or 1516 he received his doctorate in both medicines (i.e., int ernal and external) in Ferrara. 3 From 1516 until about 1524, he traveled widely thro ugh Europe. He sustained himself by his continually moving practice as he no rmally did not stay longer than three months at the same place. He cured the famous as well as the poor; among his famous patients was Erasmus of Rotterdam. Parac elsus collected a vast amount 1 1922 (Medical, Scientific Philosophical Writings). Karl Sudhoff.

He served so me time as a military surgeon in the Low Countries, Denmark, and Italy, and learned practical metallurgy at the mines in Tirol. The mines belonged to the Fugger family, who took patronage of Paracelsus' work. In the mines he studied the proce sses of preparing metals and conducted experiments as to their medicinal virtues . He also found out that particular diseases of miners were caused by the metals they w ere exposed to in the mine. 4 Between 1520 and 1522, he wrote early monographs on the diseases of miners. Around 1525, 1526 he wrote the draft towards an Alchemia medica with the goal to separate the effective medicine from its ineffectiv e part. 5 In 1527, Paracelsus was appointed city physician at Basel. Related to that position was a professorship of medicine at the University o f Basel. He introduced fundamental changes in the way and method of teachi ng. It was the tradition to teach in Latin, but Paracelsus gave his lectures in the G erman language. The study of medicine used to be theoretical. Paracelsus however required his students to actually see patients and to become practical physi cians. Basing the knowledge of students on experience meant a revolution in the wa y of teaching. 6 Paracelsus was compelled to leave Basel in 1528. He had made enemies in Basel, among them the guilt of the pharmacists, because he fought against high prices of medicine. The issue that led to his dismissal was a n unsettled question about his honorarium. When he treated successfully a dignitar y of the church, the cured patient did not want to pay him the full amount of the pre-negotiated honorarium, but only a small portion of it. He went to court in ord er to get the full honorarium, but the judge decided the case in favor of the church digni tary and he ordered Paracelsus to leave town. (Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 12.) Paracelsus resumed his wanderings mostly through the South of Germany, Switzerland, and Aust ria. In 1541, Paracelsus returned to Salzburg, where he died in 1541. The ci rcumstances of his death were related to payment. When he went to a patient's hou se to gather his honorarium for a treatment that he had performed, but for which he n ever had been paid, he found that the patient, in the meantime, was treated by a nother doctor. Paracelsus became his victim, because that doctor ordered the servant s to throw him out of the window. Paracelsus work not only had an influence on medici ne, but also on disciplines such as theology, philosophy, astronomy, linguistics and psychology. Often, Paracelsus would invent new names, because the words he found in the established systems 4 \"Paracelsus.\" 1923 2. The New International Encyclopaedia . Vol. XYIII.

Vol. 6, pp. 3-128, p. 5. 30 were inadequate to describe the facts he observed. His vocabulary is studied by linguists, who focus on the development of the Germ an language. In the fragmentary Valumen Paramirum , which belongs to his early writings around 1520, his holistic approach becomes clear. Paracelsus distinguished be tween five different spheres, which have an influence in causing illness: the cos mic sphere; the environment; factors of heritage; spiritual disturbances; and Go d's will. God is thought to send illness as a way of punishment. Three major medical works by Paracelsus can be dist inguished. In his book Paragranum , written around 1529/30, he devised a program of a new medicine based on four pillars: \"Philosophia,\" the natural s ciences and natural philosophy; \"Astronomia,\" the cosmic influence on humans; \"Alch emia,\" the teachings of medicine based on chemistry; and \"Proprietas,\" the duties of the physician derived from a Christian ethically point of view. His Opus Paramirum , written around 1531, contains basic observations on the causes of illnes s, as well as philosophical ideas. The Grosse Wundtartzney (Large Handbook for the Healing of Wounds) was pr inted in two parts in 1535. In the first part, he advised for a conservative treatment of wounds, supporting the self-healing capability of p atients; the focus of the second part was on internal medicine. Paracelsus exerted a profound influence upon the me dical beliefs of his time and found followers who continued his work. He destroye d the \"humoral pathology,\" which was founded on the belief that diseases depen d upon an excess or deficiency of bile, phlegm, or blood and taught instead that d iseases were actual entities and were to be combated with specific remedies.7 Paracelsus denounced the medicine of the Arab physicians, whose teachings were then gene rally followed. 8 He laid the 7 Paracelsus publicly burned the works of Galen. Gal en (c. 129-200) was a Greek physician, whose main work has been translate d into the Arab language. He was the physician to several Roman emperors and learned about the organs from dissection of animals. He was the first physic ian to describe diagnosis from the pulse. \"Galen's writings were regarded as almos t infallible both in the East and the West until well into the sixteenth century ... He believed strongly in pneuma , a word untranslatable by any single English word, but which strongly resembles \"spirit\" or \"breath of life\" ... In addit ion to doctrine of the pneuma , Galen held the Hippocratic view of the four humors and their accompanying types of emotion: blood (sanguine), phlegm (phlegma tic), black bile (melancholy), and yellow bile (choleric). These Gal en related to the classical doctrine of the four elements: earth, air, fire, an d water.\" \"Galen,\" Collier's 1995. New York: Collier's. Vol. 10, p. 538. 8 Based on the Greek medicine, Arab medicine had a s trong impact on the course medicine took, and looks back at a long history. Fo r instance, Arab physicians were experts at distillation and developed many dru gs for treatment of illnesses. Rhazes (c. 850), an alchemist from Baghdad, disting uished between measles and smallpox. He founded a hospital in Baghdad and wrote a Graeco-Arabic medical encyclopaedia. See Norris McWhirter. 1999. \"Medicine and Health.\" The Book of Millenium Records . London: Virgin Publishing Ltd., pp. 90-97. p. 90. 31 groundwork for pharmaceutical medicine; he introduc ed new remedies, for instance opium, mercury, sulphur, iron, arsenic, etc. and st rove to reduce the overdosing then practiced. A famous follower of Paracelsus was Joha nn Baptist von Helmont (1579- 1644), who improved his work on pharmaceutical chem istry. 9 Paracelsus' holistic approach had an important infl uence on Goethe and C. G. Jung. Goethe read Paracelsus in a time when he suffered f rom a serious illness. He \"recognized medicine's indebtedness to the traditio n of \"holism\" when he commented in his autobiography \"Medicine employs the whole ma n, because it is occupied with the whole man.\" 10 Paracelsus not only saw the physical side of an il lness, but also the soul of a patient and the social circumstances, the patient lived in. Paracelsus' holistic approach also inspired C. G. J ung: \"When Carl Gustav Jung in our century explained his analytical psychology, wh ich treated the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of the person, he referred to the writings of Paracelsus as a helpmeet in articulating his per spective.\" (Blum, op. cit. , p. 250). The results of C. G. Jung's analytical psychology a re still relevant in the cure of some mental disorders such as drug addiction. A promisin g area of application of this line of research lies in the outpatient treatment of men tally ill persons. Blum has developed and implemented such an out-patient progr am, which allows drug addicts to delineate the cultural variables, which impact t heir life. In an out-patient program, the patients can maintain their social and economic activities, and by relying on facts from the patients' environment, the therapist can p rovide them with better guidelines than in an in-patient program. From a cost-effectiv eness standpoint, out-patient programs tend to be preferred to in-patient program s. 11 During his lifetime, Paracelsus continuously had th e problem that competitors would reprint and alter his medical texts. There were, of course, no copyrights. His social science related writings were not subject to the sa me plagiarism and vandalism as they have more the character of a public good and h ence were not subject to stealing. This is why his social science writings h ave remained more authentic and also shed light on his medical writings. He was a h olistic author who saw the practice of medicine always in the context of societal circu mstances, in which it had to occur.12 The context with economic issues is the main focus of this chapter (2.2). 9 Keil, Gundolf. 1995. \"Paracelsus und die neuen and C.

For an overview of Paracelsus' social writings 32 Economic consequences of monopolies in health care are the subject of the third section (2.3). The chapter ends with a summary and conclusions. 2.2 Economic Thoughts in Paracelsus' Social Writ ings Paracelsus was a devoted physician, theologian and philosopher, who distinguished among several realms of which a society is composed . Therefore there are four estates (ordine, monarchi as), as there are one agriculture, another crafts, a third the liberal ar ts, a fourth the government (authority, magistracy). 13 According to Paracelsus, medicine and medical care belonged to the third monarchia, the liberal arts. Now in the third monarchia, there are many arts an d sciences, which God revealed, as astronomia, medicina. These arts and l abor cannot be paid. For who can pay a good physician who brings you back lo st health and keeps you alive, until the last minute comes? 14 Paracelsus oftentimes pondered about the nature of medicine. On the one hand, he considered medical care a priceless service, but on the other hand, he noted that patients faced a high risk of treatment, because th e medical scientific knowledge of his time was uncertain, medical cures were not reli able and physicians were frequently not able to help. All the time, and with great and unrelenting effor ts I have tried to understand the basic reason of medicine, in order to understan d whether medicine can really be called an art, or not, and what basically it consists in. I have been driven in this by various causes. Among them are th e uncertainty with which our treatments are wrought, which is reflected in t he low esteem and the lack of applause of our daily practice: likewise, that s o many patients perish: that they die, remain paralyzed, or are abandoned by the ir doctors. And this is not only the case with respect to just particular condi tions; it is true for pretty much all the conditions. Our entire practice is unr eliable. In my time, there is not a single doctor who would be able to heal a too thache with certainty, nor compare Johannes Hanel. 1995. \"Paracelsus' Social W ritings from a Modern Social Science Point of View.\" International Review of Comparative Public Policy .

This quote by Paracelsus and the transla tion is according to Johannes Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 3. 33 an even smaller illness, not to speak of a serious illness at all. 15 The struggling physician even wanted to give up his career, because he thought that the medical practice could never become a reliable art. Never have I made the experience that I can ever b e completely sure about the effect of a medical practice and cure, no matte r what kind of illness it was. I have thought about it a lot, that medical practic e is an unreliable art, which cannot be used adequately, the right cure is hard t o find, even under the best of circumstances and with luck heals one, but makes ten others ill. This gave me a reason to think that it is a betrayal of spiri ts in order to deceive men and to make them small. 16 At other times, Paracelsus was able to overcome the se feelings; then, he decided that medicine and medical practice was an art, inde ed, \"... that the art is true, just, reliable, perfect and a unity, in times of need a r eliable indispensable art, useful for all the ill, and helpful for them to become healthy .\" 17 The following examples show that despite this decision, the nature of medicine kept occupying his thinking. On the one hand, Paracelsus thought that physicians were n ot able to provide adequate treatment, because they lacked the knowledge requir ed, or the risk of treatment involved was too high, or a medical cure did not ex ist. On the other hand, dishonest 15 Translation by J\u00fcrgen Backhaus (1995, op. cit. , p. xvi). The original German quote reads as follows: \"Allerw\u00e4rts die Arzneikunst erforscht. Ich hab F\u00fcrnehmens His Life and Truths of Life in Autobiographical Notes). Edited and with an introduction by Karl Bittel. Leipzig: Verlag Philipp Reclam. (10:19) 16 This hat, es sei ein Betr\u00fcgnis von Geistern, op. cit ., (10:19). 17 The original German quote reads as follows: ie cit ., (10:19). 34 doctors could take advantage of the uncertain natur e of medicine, because patients could not control them. Paracelsus wondered how patients could tell whether a treatment was good or bad, if even physicians did not know the effect of a tre atment with certainty. This was aggravated by the fact that some illnesses would di sappear after a while without treatment and others despite of the wrong treatment . Moreover, the effects of medical cures varied among different patients. In t his situation, patients could not control physicians' behavior. Therefore, doctors we re able to become rich, while oftentimes providing bad treatment. A lack of patie nts' control, resulting from the nature of medicine, opened the opportunity to fraud for deceitful physicians and, so Paracelsus, the medical profession was therefore no t honored more highly. Paracelsus despised of book knowledge, because he f elt that the books did not teach about the risks involved in treatment. As wil l be shown later in this section, Paracelsus wanted to lower the risk of treatment by learning more about cures and illnesses at different locations and from various h ealth care providers. He thought that book knowledge opened another opportunity to p hysicians' fraud and this he considered foolishness. He accused the well-establi shed physicians, who relied on book knowledge, of not primarily being interested i n providing good medical care, but in gaining a high status and income. Such foolishness I have also found in the writings of all the old. And this despite the fact that at the courts, in the large c ities, at the rich - who had been willing to pay so much (!) and yet have not be en able to be helped by any of the physicians - I am talking about the well -dressed physicians wearing silk, golden rings, etc., not the unimportant ones, but those with pomp and kind words. 18 Those physicians took advantage of the fact that th e rich patients in the cities and at the courts who are in poor health are not able to c onduct their daily business as usual. They have much more to lose than any of the poor patients. Consequently, they are willing and also able to pay a higher sum in order to gain their health back than the poor. Paracelsus observed many different ways of dishones ty and fraud among physicians which damaged the reputation of medicine. He noted that some physicians were able to increase their income by not admitting that the chance of healing was very small. They made the patients believe that they wou ld get better with continued medical treatment. While those physicians were eage r to take their patients' 18 This quote reads in the original German as follows : \"Auch bei allen Alten 1944, op. cit. , (10:19). 35 payments, they did not provide adequate treatment i n return. Paracelsus scorned those physicians, who for monetary reasons concentr ated on the diagnosis and forgot treatment and all limitations of life. 19 He also described physicians who abandoned patients, because they could not help the m any longer, or because a patient was no longer able to pay for treatment. Some of his colleagues applied bad and ineffective cures. As a physician, Paracelsus was better able to recognize such bad an d ineffective cures than the patients. His fellow physicians, however, did not a ppreciate that kind of control. They criticized the alternative treatment Paracelsus pro vided; in other cases they copied his procedures or stole his medicine. Paracelsus re ported the following case: when his family doctor was not able to help a patient, P aracelsus, who happened to be in the vicinity, was called in. He was promised a gene rous honorarium, reimbursement for his travel expenses, as well as free room and b oard. Paracelsus accepted the offer and performed a chiropractic treatment in ord er to help the patient. While he performed the treatment, the other doctor looked on , partially learning the treatment. Later, his room was broken into and his medicine wa s stolen. He did not get paid, neither for his travel expenses, nor did he get the honorarium that was promised to him. Paracelsus considered those physicians as fool s, whom he fought fiercely, and concentrated on the patients who did appreciate his cures. The sick liked me. I wrote this letter, because I do not want to insult any of the honest physicians by my bad-tempered writing. I hop e to live with them in peace and to get their praise. The other fools I do not honor. Their scolding is my praise, it is to my benefit, and it fills my pur se. For I know so many of those evildoers that among thousand physicians, the re will not be a single one, who will say: thank you, Theophraste, but you are a fool! The war between us has been going on for so long. They forced me to leave Lithuania, thereafter Prussia, thereafter Poland, t his was not enough. Neither did the Dutch like me, nor the universities, nor th e Jews, nor the monks. But thank God: the sick liked me. 20 Paracelsus was forced by his enemies to leave the c ountry, university, or monastery. 19 In his theological and philosophical contributions , Paracelsus addressed the question of the limitations of life; he even foresa w the possibility of genetic modifications. Compare Johannes Hanel, 1995, op. cit. , p. 4. 20 The original German quote reads as follows: \"Den K ranken ., (6:180). 36 They tried to exclude him on the basis of admission regulations and accused him of not being a physician. Paracelsus responded by citi ng his battlefield experience: 21 According to your judgment, I am a surgeon, not a physician. How do you arrive at such a judgment? This is despite the fact that I have evidently healed eighteen princes - who had been abandoned by you - and you have not even acknowledged this. And also despite the fact that I have treated and healed large numbers of the feverish, for about forty diff erent illnesses that had been found, in the Low Lands, Romania, Naples, and in th e wars of Venice, Denmark, and the Netherlands. 22 Facing hostility around him and inspired by a high sense of responsibility for God and towards his fellow men, Paracelsus' strategy wa s to extend and deepen his medical knowledge, thereby improving medical cures, and to apply his knowledge widely. He noted that the success of a medical cure also depended on the persons close to the patient. In order to succeed in healin g a patient, the patient's family and friends have to be supportive. It depends on their intentions and behavior, whether a physician will be able to help a patient. According to Paracelsus, any treatment remains ineffective, if the family or friends do no t want a recovery of the patient. In that case, the best medicine \"gets spilled, the pat ient dies, the recipients of a bequest become lucky, the physician gets insulted, and the art of medicine dishonored.\" 23 21 In treating the wounded at the battlefield, it was important to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic. Paracelsus cures were not only directed towards healing single wounded soldiers, but towards preven tion of infection. In the case of infectious diseases, he tried to reduce the dang er of infection. At times, however, it seems that Paracelus was more concerned with the development of social medicine than with individually effective tr eatment. An example is his treatment of syphilis with quicksilver. Much later it became obvious that treatment with quicksilver was perhaps not the best method of helping the individual patient, but it prevented the disease fr om spreading. Decades later, the syphilis treatment with quicksilver was replace d by a method that was based on the former heat therapy Paracelsus had rejected. For individual treatment, the heat therapy turned out to be the better method . Gundolf Keil. Steiner Verlag, pp. 17-46, p. 44. 22 The original German reads as follows: \"Ich s ., (7:374). 23 The original German quote from a footnote by Parac elsus reads as follows: \"... 37 As has been mentioned above, Paracelsus did not fin d reliable medical knowledge in the books. Therefore, he decided to gather the know ledge of effective cures through extended wanderings, by using \"his eyes as his prof essors.\" He visited various practitioners of health care, such as barbers, midw ives, etc., and investigated home remedies in order to develop reliable alternative c ures. This was not without personal hardships and sacrifices. Paracelsus noted: \"Thus I wandered through the countries and led a vagrant life - alone, and foreign, and di fferent.\" 24 Paracelsus wanted to improve the knowledge of medic al practice and treatments, thereby making cures more reliable. He insisted tha t the only way of gaining the experience needed was to wander through the differe nt countries with their varying conditions of climate and geography. Only then, suf ficient comparison between medical cures could be achieved. Thus I have studied at the Universities for many y ears, in Germany, in Italy, in France, in search for the nature of the medical art . I did not want to rely on the same teachers and to base my knowledge on their wri tings and books only, but wandered further to Granada, to Lisbon through Spain, through England, through the Mark Brandenburg, through Prussia, thro ugh Lithuania, through Poland, Hungary, Walachia, Transylvania, Croatia, t he Wendian Mark, also other countries, not necessarily to be mentioned he re. And in all the places and locations I inquired busily and diligently, did research in order to find the art of medical practice that was surely working and really experienced. I got this knowledge not only from the doctors, but also from barbers, bath keepers, learned physicians, women, from witches, as far as they have concerned themselves with caring, from alchemists, I went to the monasteries, to the noble and common people, to the bright and to the s imple-minded. 25 dann wird 1944, op. cit. , footnote, p. 58. 24 The German quote reads as follows: \"Also bin ich g Hanel, 1995, op. cit ., p. 9, note 13. 25 This quote reads in the original German as follows : \"Hab also die Hohen Schulen erfahren lange den Grund op. cit. , (10:19). 38 Paracelsus wandered through Europe, but limited the application of his medical knowledge to this continent. He considered it not t o be useful to go to Africa and America. He believed that the cures had to be found in the immediate vicinity of the disease. One had to adapt therapies to individual n eeds. According to Paracelsus, climate and other environmental conditions would in fluence the course of a disease. (Hanel, op.cit ., p.10.) Paracelsus often developed medicine himself in orde r to adapt it to an individual patient and his immediate environment. If the effec tive ingredient was cheap to produce, this easily caused a problem with pharmaci sts, who did not want to sell Paracelsus' medications as fees and consequently th eir incomes would obviously depend on the materials provided. In order to make it more expensive, he sometimes added precious ingredients such as ground pearls or spices to medicine that would not be damaging to the patient. He did this only in the case of rich patients. Poor patients just got the basic formula which he prepar ed himself, so he did not have to send them to the apothecary. In a letter of complaint to the council of the city of Basel, where he was the city physician and at the same time had the position of a professor, Paracelsus demanded stronger controls of apothecaries. He aske d for professional visitations of apothecaries, demanded an oath of pharmacists, and wanted a city physician to control patients' recipes. He further demanded inde pendency between pharmacists and physicians and an evaluation of a pharmacist's experience and knowledge. 26 He recognized that this letter of complaint could have adverse consequences for him, as well as for his patients. The pharmacists' guild wa s the driving force behind the city's decision that Paracelsus had to leave town. Another monopoly criticized by Paracelsus was that of the influential Fuggers, who at one point in time funded his research in their mine s. The first medical work by Paracelsus that was published during his lifetime w as \"On the thorough Healing Power of the Wood Guajak,\" 1529. He criticized the use of the wood that was imported around 1514 from South America to Europe a nd sold by the Fuggers for healing syphilis. An incidence is reported, where P aracelsus accused the Fuggers of selling an ineffective and expensive cure against s yphilis. \"... Their wood ... had no other effect than that it added to their own benefi t, while they knew that in their own country houses and alleys were full of the ill, who se illness has been made worse by 26 Paracelsus, 1944, op. cit. , 4 : 141, p. 45. Paracelsus was probably aware of the edict issued by Frederik II in 1240 that prohibited combining the functions of physician and pharmacist. With this edict, Frederik II achieved a higher differentiation of the medical profession and preve nted that physicians would have an immediate interest in increasing their own income by prescriptions. Compare Philipp Herder-Dorneich. of Health Care: History of the F ield, Relevant Areas, and Theoretical Bases). Baden-Baden: Nomos-V erlag. 39 the wood.\" 27 The Fuggers established large trade monopolies; th eir business encompassed the trade in basic ingredients of medic ine. Measures against the monopolies of large trade houses had been decided b y the Imperial Diet, but remained ineffective, because the emperor depended on the Fuggers' money in order to finance the budget. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 60.) Paracelsus thought that monopolies could be prevent ed by a supreme government. He wanted the Emperor to keep the power to himself. The Emperor should be inspired by God and act only according to God's wil l. Then, clergy, nobility, and traders could not acquire and misuse power. Trade h ouses could not, with the help of courts and governments, establish monopolies and charge high prices. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 68.) Another concern by Paracelsus was the question of t he honorarium of the physician. His thought sometimes overlaps with what has been d iscussed above because of the physician's position as a local monopolist. Par acelsus noted that the services of a good physician are of immense value, but that it can be extremely difficult to collect the payment once the patient has recovered. As soon as patients get better, they would only want to pay a small amount and some even tried to avoid payment. They cheated by not paying the physician's honorar ium. It is the manner of the patients that they try to deceive the physician . If one of them is healed, then he does not want to pay anymore. But not only the patients, also at court one judges about a physician's honorarium as if he would \"make shoes,\" despite the fact that one faces the risk for ones o wn life. If a treatment is not successful, then one wants to pay nothing at all; i f it is successful, then the patients hide so that they do not see the doctor an y more; this is worse than the devil. They like him if he charges nothing. But they start to scold and shame him if his services are not for free. No mone y is just earned und given less willingly than the doctor's fee (honorarium). Money is given willingly for playing games, prostitution, and drinking. But peop le are reluctant to pay in the case that they are helped with a bodily need; a ll sick people are of the same opinion. 28 27 The German quote reads as follows: \"Vom Holtz Guai aco gr\u00fcndlicher heylung.\" op. cit ., p. 104, note 185. 28 The German quote reads as follows: \"Um das Arzthon orar Teufel. Paracelsus reported that patients did not want to p ay for an unsuccessful treatment. When it was successful, some patients would hide, w hen it came to paying. In Basel, Paracelsus made a bad experience with a judge. When he went to court in order to get his pre-negotiated honorarium (as noted above), he was ordered to leave town. Paracelsus complained that courts did not realize t he difference between a shoemaker and a physician. He argued that the physi cian needed a risk premium for risking his own life, while the shoemaker would not be confronted with such a risk. Why, so asked Paracelsus, did people willingly pay for playing, prostitutes, and drinking and not for medical services? We can only speculate about the answer. Due to his wanderings, Paracelsus might not have been a round long enough to build up long term relationships with patients. In a long te rm relationship, it would not make sense for a patient to hide, when it comes to payin g. The patient would pay voluntarily, because in case of illness, he wanted to be treated again in the future. As Paracelsus moved around so often, he could not buil d up trust in a long term relationship, but had to rely on a short run input evaluation. Paracelsus observation that patients only want to m ake a small payment or no payment at all upon recovery refers to the subjecti ve evaluation of health lost, health gained back, and death avoided, which can be explai ned in a human capital framework. One could expect that no amount of money could compensate a person for dying if is assumed that the person 1) derives a positive utility from living, 2) does not have a very strong bequest motive, and 3) does not want to give up life in order to fulfill a particular mission for society. That p erson should be willing to spend all of her or his resources in order to avoid death, becau se the value of life is infinite to her or him. In the case of immediate death, those resou rces have lost all value, since the person cannot use them anymore. This means that the resources have no opportunity costs. Therefore, the subjective cost o f spending all money is zero to the person, who wants to avoid immediate death. Similar ly, in the case of a severe illness, the opportunity costs of resources can be expected to be relatively low. 29 In the extreme case of death avoided, the subjectiv e evaluation of life is very high, but the patients' subjective evaluation changes whe n their health improves. With better health they have gained a more promising fut ure, which makes their resources more valuable. Opportunity costs of resources are n o longer zero or very low as in the case of immediate death. Due to the recovery, p atients face much higher opportunity costs of resources. Consequently, recov ered patients might try to reduce or even avoid the payment that they were originally willing to make. Paracelsus has huren, saufen, das op. cit . (6:180). 29 These conclusions can only be drawn under the assu mption that patients behave rationally. Richard A. Posner. 1995. Aging and Old Age . Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. Compare \"T he Dread of Death,\" pp. 108-115, p. 110. 41 observed this phenomenon, but without providing the explanation that can be obtained in a human capital framework. He offered t wo main causes as an alternative explanation why a physician, in his own words, is \"not honored more,\" in other words, not considered worth the \"honorarium\" or payment. Paracelsus' first explanation referred to what is c alled today an asymmetry in information on the side of the patients. He had obs erved the paradox that patients, who are very ill, have a high willingness to pay, b ut if they become healthy, their willingness to pay is low. Therefore, he concluded that patients cannot evaluate the services of a good doctor. He argued that patients do not know how much effort and scholarship is involved by a physician, who wants t o arrive at a good therapy. In his own case, the effort consisted in his wanderings, t hrough which he gained empirical evidence and arrived at effective therapies; and be cause of this asymmetry in information, Paracelsus proposed to charge the pati ents according to their income or wealth. His second explanation of the paradox that patients wanted to pay less upon recovery than before concerned the risk involved in treatment and the possibilities of fraud this offered to a deceitful doctor. Paracelsu s thought that the physician was not honored more by the recovered patients, and consequ ently his treatment not thought to be worth the payment, because of the risk involv ed in treatment. Due to the unreliability of medical knowledge, the risk of tre atment was very high at the time. Paracelsus described some \"fools,\" fellow physician s, who for reasons of self- interest would even aggravate the risk of treatment . He considered their behavior as despicable. Paracelsus demanded that one should help the poor b y sharing available means; they should not be treated as beggars, but as honor able people. 30 In his payment practice, Paracelsus treated poor patients for free . He wanted people to make voluntary charitable contributions in order to fina nce the provision of health care to the poor. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 7.) His own testament is an example for this practice. After his death, he wanted most of his wealth to be distributed among the poor. 31 During his lifetime, Paracelsus' books got censured and he thought it was because he demanded to provide health care to the poor for free. After the censorship of Nuremberg prohibited publishing his works, he could for a long time not find print houses and publishers for his writings. (Paracelsus , 1944, op. cit. , p. 64.) He sold his writings through markets, where they oftentimes got plagiarized. He therefore wanted an author's copyright. Paracelsus input-based explanation of the physician 's fee is not incompatible with an 30 Ren\u00e9 Bernoulli. 1995. \"\u00dcber die Sozialethik des Ar ztes Paracelsus.\" Physician 14 5. 31 , \"Testament of September 21, 1541,\" pp. 120- 124. 42 alternative, the explanation according to the oppor tunity cost principle. He treated people according to the opportunity cost principle. Let us assume that he could only ask for payment, if the treatment was successful. T hen, he set the price according to how important recovery was to the patient. The rich er a patient, the higher his opportunity costs of illness could be expected to b e, because he was not able to look after his daily business. This principle is consist ent with Paracelsus ethical approach. Those patients, who could not afford payment, do no t lose much by being ill. Therefore, their opportunity cost of illness, in mo netary terms, can be assumed to be zero. This is consistent with no payment at all. On the other hand, by treating the poor, Paracelsus himself gained additional experien ce and knowledge, thereby making treatments more reliable. Not charging the p oor caused problems with some local doctors and the more affluent patients. For i nstance, they forced Paracelsus to leave Salzburg, when he helped peasants, who could not afford a physician. (Hanel, op. cit ., p. 5.) In this section, we have seen that more than 500 ye ars ago, Paracelsus has made important contributions to economic issues of healt h. Next to his thoughts about the honorarium, he showed that not only the medical pra ctice is relevant for the performance of medicine, but also the way how the p rovision of health care is organized. Paracelsus has shown that monopolies in health care can have negative consequences. For instance, he fought against the p ractices of pharmacies who charged patients prices higher than necessary for a medicine prescribed. He criticized powerful local physicians, who would con centrate on the diagnosis and not try to gain additional knowledge in order to improv e the quality of health care provided. He criticized the Fuggers for excluding e ffective therapies. They had formed a monopoly through which they provided only particular ingredients for medical uses. He suffered from censorship of his wr itings; and he criticized the language monopoly. By lecturing in German, he made it possible for those students to study medicine, who did not know the Latin langu age. 2.3 Monopolies in Health Care Paracelsus criticized the exclusion of therapies an d talents by the organization of health care provision. Similar effects of monopolie s in health care can also be seen in more modern examples. 32 The consequences of monopolization in health care services will typically take the form of restrictin g supply in order to increase physicians' fees. This was shown empirically by Reu ben Kessel for specific chapters of the American Medical Association (AMA) and their overall, i. e. national approach of licensing medical schools. 33 Only licensed schools according to their standard 32 Compare the contribution by Andries Nentjes, 2002. \"The Structure of Dutch Health Care.\" Presentation at the 15th Workshop in Law and Economics, March 27-28, Erfurt. 33 Reuben A. Kessel. 1970. \"The A.M.A. and Supply of Physicians.\" Editors: Ronald H. Coase and Merton H. Miller. 1980. Essays in Applied Price Theory by 43 could graduate physical doctors. The analysis of the organization of the AMA by Kess el is an example of rent- seeking. 34 Rents are defined as \"a return in excess of a reso urce owner's opportunity costs.\" 35 Rents can either arise in the price system, and th en, they are equivalent to profit seeking, or rents can be contrived artificia lly through regulatory government actions transferring wealth from one group to anoth er. If there is competition for these artificially contrived rents, then the proces s of using resources to contrive the rents is referred to as rent-seeking. Resources use d in the competitive process to win a transfer are wasted from a society's point of view. Rent-seeking refers to this wasteful process. It does not lead to productive ga ins. On the normative side, rent- seeking theory specifies and estimates the costs of rent-seeking behavior to the economy. Positive rent-seeking theory as applied in the analysis by Kessel addresses the question of why contrived rents exist in the economy, or more specifically, in certain sectors of the economy suc h as the health care sector, and not in others. In the United States, physicians can only be licens ed if they have graduated from an accredited medical school. The accrediting authorit y is the AMA, a private institution. If accreditation is withheld, fewer students will b e trained and therefore, the supply of physicians will be curtailed. With the help of gove rnmental powers, the AMA restrained the output of physicians. Kessel showed empirically that the practice of admission with respect to accreditation of medical schools led to an artificial shortage of physicians. This made it possible for p hysicians to demand above average fees. Instrumental to the reduction of the number of physicians was the Flexner report of 1910. On request of the AMA, the influential Carnegie Foundation commissioned Abraham Flexner to evaluate proprietar y medical schools. (Kessel, op. cit ., p. 38.) Flexner discredited many medical schools . This did not occur on the basis of quality considerations. The criterion rath er was whether the medical training program of a particular school was similar to that of Johns Hopkins University. Graduates from discredited schools were not allowed to participate in the state licensure examinations. Therefore, many of the disc redited medical schools were forced to close. As a consequence, the number of ph ysicians declined. At the remaining universities, it became more expen sive for students to acquire the degree of \"Medical Doctor.\" The higher costs for st udents made it more difficult for minorities to become physicians. In particular to b lack students the requirement of internship in a hospital posed a barrier, because t hey often were not hired for reasons of discrimination. Kessel noted a sharp dec line in the number of black doctors and the closure of many black medical schoo ls. Another result of the implementation of Flexner's report was that the med ical training of students exhibited Reuben A. Kessel . Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Pre ss, pp. 37-53, p. 37. 34 Gordon Tullock. 1967. \"The Welfare Costs of Monopo lies, Tariffs and Theft.\" Western Economic Journal . 5.3, pp. 224-232. 35 Robert Tollison. 1982. \"Rent Seeking: A Survey. \" Kyklos . 35.4, p. 575. 44 relatively little variation from school to school. This training pattern of medical students was frequently written into state laws. (K essel, op. cit ., p. 39.) Kessel noted that most of Flexner's work had been d one by the AMA before, but that they had hidden their self-interest by implying the influential Carnegie Foundation. There was evidence of discrimination: the higher st andards of quality did not apply to the majority of practitioners already in existence; there were no re-examination requirements for doctors; appointment decisions in hospitals were not simply made on the basis of quality; and there was great intern al solidarity and cohesion within the medical profession, which made it unlikely that one doctor would testify against another one. (Kessel, op. cit ., pp. 44, 45.) The example of the AMA shows that organized medicin e used the power of government by successfully lobbying for a system of state licensing, which allowed setting up a practice only to physicians from accre dited school. Moreover, the AMA used litigation by bringing suit against some pract itioners who lacked the required education. Before the Flexner report was issued, me dical educators could license their own graduates. The introduction of state lice nsing allowed a reduction in the number of physicians in order to increase the fees of individual physicians. State laws fixing the training pattern of medical student s are evidence for rent-seeking as well. The effects were a less diversified student b ody and the exclusion of certain therapies. It took until the 1960s before the polic y changed. The number of electives open to students increased and the costs to become a medical doctor decreased, but Kessel noted that the number of physicians trai ned was still not allowed to increase significantly. (Kessel, op. cit ., p. 46.) The AMA systematically excluded other therapies suc h as homeopathy, osteopathy, and chiropractic treatment. While homeopaths were i mportant competitors to American physicians in the mid nineteenth century, they virtually disappeared during the first decade of the twentieth century. The medi cine used and prescribed by homeopaths became subject to regulation. 36 Regulation of ethical drugs ( i. e. drugs that require prescription) is part of the mission o f the American Food and Drug Administration. With the help of pure food and drug legislation, organized physicians were able to suppress competition from unpatented m edicine vendors. Chiropractic treatment survived the attacks of the AMA by forming its own Association and organizing a counter lobby exposing the restrictive practices of the AMA. Chiropractors cited boycotts of newspapers con taining advertisements of alternative medicine by the AMA as well as a strong increase of press releases written by organized physicians. They protested aga inst the use of the Latin language: \"By requiring collegiate training before medical school and the use of Latin prescriptions, the AMA had erected artificial barri ers designed to elevate the physician and intimidate the patient.\" (Martin, op. cit. , p. 166). Chiropractors cited the requirement of Latin for physicians as an additiona l barrier of entry posed by 36 Steven C. Martin. 1995. \"A History of Chiropractic .\" Editor: Kenneth F. Kiple. The Cambridge World History of Human Disease . Pp. 164-170, p. 164. 45 theAMA. Five hundred years earlier, Paracelsus foug ht against the knowledge of Latin as an entry requirement for physicians. The v ictory for the chiropractors came in 1987 with the defeat of the AMA in a major lawsu it. 37 Graphically, the rent-seeking situation can be depi cted as follows: In the diagram, q represents the total supply of ph ysicians and p stands for the price of medical services; p * is the price for medical services, which would pre vail in a market where physicians have to compete for patient s. Suppose the market for medical services is characterized by a downward slo ping and linear demand curve. The AMA artificially restricted the number of physi cians from q * to q m. The number of physicians, q m, is smaller than that of a competitive market, q *, and the price charged, p m, is higher than that at the competitive market, p *. The rent to be captured and/or dissipated by the costs of rent-seeking cons ists of monopoly revenue minus revenue if no monopoly is present. It amounts to th e price difference (pm - p*) multiplied with the restricted number of physicians /quantity of services (q m), pmMNp*. 37 Wilk v. American Medical Association. 1987. 671 F. Supp. 1465 (N. D. Ill.). Quoted by Steven C. Martin, 1995, op. cit ., p. 170. D D C pm p* M q m q * 0N q p Excess fees and services forgone Figure: Rent-Seeking in a Monopoly 46 The Harberger triangle MNC describes the welfare lo ss to society, when moving from a competitive situation to a monopoly, but the welfare loss to society from monopoly is much bigger than depicted by the Harber ger triangle. 38 Tullock denoted the rectangle pmMNp* as the potential rent to the monopolist, which is used up as costs of rent-seeking. The rectangle p mMNp* denotes the potential for waste to society, if mon opolists spent resources to capture the rent. Harberger's an alysis is in a static context, whereas Tullock refers to a dynamic process. With t he theory of rent-seeking he developed an instrument to analyze this dynamic pro cess. When moving from a competitive industry to a monopoly, then we can ass ume constancy of the cost curve only in the first step; beyond, the cost curves wil l change. Once a monopoly has been established, the external pressure to keep costs low is weakened and X-inefficiency may and probably will c reep in. This can also be considered as a type of rent dissipation. Further i nsights on the dynamics of monopoly creation can be gained from Schumpeter. 39 The AMA caused the decline of the number of physici ans, which allowed an increase in physicians' incomes. The AMA also pursued the ex clusion of certain therapies by practitioners other than physicians; and it restrai ned the diversity of students trained as physicians. We can speak of a case of rent-seeki ng, because the organized physicians took advantage of the help of government and of the legal system. In the case of the AMA, the gains of rent-seeking consiste d in the fee-revenue enjoyed by physicians in excess of the market clearing fees. T he losses to society, represented by the dead-weight loss MNC, consisted in these ext ra fees, including the cost of that slack which a monopoly structure brings about, as well as in the reduction of the level of care, both quantity and quality, and in th e non-availability of certain therapies. Under normal conditions of rent-seeking, Tullock's rectangle is a sheer waste to society; the case discussed, a reduction in the sup ply of physicians, can hardly qualify as a cost-containment measure. The theory o f rent-seeking also contains a different case, however. It is possible to use Tull ock's rectangle as a prize in order to 38 Instead of using the term \"profit,\" Tullock used t he term \"rent\" to describe the return to the monopoly. By creating a sphere of exc lusivity, the factor over which exclusive use has been defined becomes the subject of a monopoly. By implication, the owner of this artificially scarce factor enjoys the monopolist's rent. The rent can be turned into a pure monopoly p rofit or else be used for other purposes. In the case of the AMA, a side effe ct was the introduction of \"professional medical practices\" at the expense of the traditional medical practices, partly owed to the Indians. Compare Robe rt D. Tollison, op. cit ., p. 579. 39 Joseph A. Schumpeter. 1961. The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profit, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle . New York: Oxford University Press. 47 stimulate a desired outcome. In that case, the rect angle is not a societal waste. It could therefore be possible to design cost-containm ent measures in terms of a rent- seeking game by giving the rectangle in the form of a prize for better treatments achieved at lower costs. Patents for drugs are the standard example of such a rent- seeking arrangement in society's interest. 40 Paracelsus' oftentimes idiosyncratic musings are by no means as far fetched as they have been depicted in the literature over the last several centuries. Without stepping into the details of specific member states of the E uropean Union, the following set of constellations can readily be found. They all illus trate Paracelsus' concerns in simple microeconomic terms. We have seen that professional groups can exploit the legal system and form a monopoly. This leads to volume re strictions and a higher price. Next to such examples of market failure we also obs erve government failure in health care. In a nationalized health care system, or in a highly regulated health care system, the state itself can act as a monopsony and appropriate the monopsony rent. Health care fees are kept low and volume of h ealth care services provided is restricted. Neither health care providers, nor pati ents can easily circumvent government controls. Under these conditions, waitin g lines are likely to result. As Buchanan and Tullock have variously pointed out, ma rket failure cannot be construed as a cause for government to intervene. O ne first has to show that governments can perform better than the market. 2.4 Summary and Conclusions Why it is useful to dig out an author who has writt en some five hundred years ago? After five hundred years have passed, Paracelsus of fers such a fascination that his social-economic work is still being edited. He iden tified the structure of the medical profession not only in relationship to the nature o f medicine, but also in relationship to local circumstances, such as city regulations, r egulations by guilts or requirements by universities. His examples of the honorarium of the physician, as well as early forms of crime and misconduct by medical doctors an d pharmacists highlight the tension between the practice of medicine as a profe ssion and as a business. His approach is holistic. In particular, he tried to in tegrate pharmacology and medical science, but in a broader context is is also seekin g the integration with what today are the social sciences. Paracelsus' put the medical science on an empirical footing. He overcame Aristotelian medicine and showed that the functioni ng of bodies relies on a chemical basis. An example is his early research on miners' diseases where he looked at the environment as a factor causing illness. Through hi s research in the mines of the 40 Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. 1983. \"Competition, Innovation a nd Regulation in the Pharmaceutical Industry.\" Managerial and Decision Economics . Vol. 4, Nr. 2, pp. 107-121. 48 Fuggers, Paracelsus laid the basis for pharmaceutic al chemistry. In his holistic approach, he went beyond pharmacy and tried to inte grate physical, chemical, and economic variables. Paracelsus' holistic approach to health had an impa ct on Goethe and C. G. Jung. It found application in the treatment of certain menta l illnesses, for instance by the concept of an out-patient treatment for drug addict s (Blum). Holistic medicine seeks to make the patients participants in their own cure . They become agents, who share responsibilities with the health professional. This takes off part of the pressure of the health care professional. The patients monitor the variables in their conditions and will be guided to make changes in their behavior an d environment that facilitate healing. Comparisons by health economists of in-pat ient and out-patient programs show that for some mental illnesses out-patient pro grams tend to be less costly and more successful than in-patient programs. The immediate environment of the patient mattered t o Paracelsus. He adjusted therapies to individual needs and tried to find the effective ingredient for medicine in a patient's immediate environment. If the medicine was inexpensive, this caused problems with apothecaries, because pharmacists did not want to sell his medicine. As has been shown in the chapter, Paracelsus recogn ized the problem as one of organization and demanded controls and the abolishm ent of monopolistic structures. The question of honorarium received Paracelsus' att ention on several occations. He thought that no one could pay a physician the true value for what a treatment was actually worth. This thought is expressed by the te rm \"honorarium,\" because more is at stake than an exchange of money for certain serv ices; the physician is honored for his work; the value of his services is recognized. However, a dilemma occurred when patients, who recovered, did not want to pay much o r did not want to pay at all. Paracelsus explained this dilemma with two major re asons. On the one hand, he thought that the honorarium sho uld reimburse the physician for his scholarship and his efforts required to arrive at effective cures. The patients could not really know how much effort was needed to becom e proficient. Paracelsus improved the quality of health care provision by ad vancing the knowledge of medical art and practices, as well as by pointing out decei tful practices. Instead of book knowledge, he concentrated on other typically not d ocumented sources such as barbers' experience, healers' practices, and midwif es' knowledge. Therefore, Paracelsus charged the patients according to income and wealth. On the other hand, Paracelsus thought that the medi cal profession was not honored more due to the uncertain nature of medicine. In hi s time, knowledge was not always proven, cures were unreliable or there were no cure s at all, and there was a high risk of treatment. This opened the door to fraudulent be havior of deceitful doctors, who were more interested in gaining a high income and g etting the status of a doctor than in helping patients. Through his wanderings, he not only found useful experience, but also many deceitful practices in the supply of heal th care. 49 It was the Fuggers, who provided Paracelsus with th e means to conduct his path breaking research in their mines. Paracelsus critic ized them for making profits by selling ineffective medicine, such as the wood Guaj ak, thereby excluding the more effective therapies. As has been noted above, the p harmacists, acting as a monopoly, often did not want to sell Paracelsus' me dicine, because it was too cheap and would not generate enough income. He accused th e pharmacists' guilt of Basel of exploiting the situation. Ironically, research r esults today show that the competitive process of large pharmaceutical industry goes throu gh innovations. Here, a monopoly offers the security to develop and carry t hrough an innovation. This does not take away that in a monopoly inefficiency can c reep in. How much progress have we made in five hundred year s? The honorarium of the physician is still an issue that keeps health econo mists busy. Monopolies in health care are still present. They are justified by the p resence of increasing returns, for instance in the case of highly specialized treatmen t, or, as we have seen in the case of the pharmaceutical industry, in order to facilit ate innovations. But have we found the appropriate means to deal with the disadvantage s of monopolies? The introduction of diagnosis-related groups in hospita ls or pre-paid practices have increased competition in health care, but waiting l ines, a decrease in health care quality, and non-availability of certain therapies can still be observed in modern, European health care systems. From the point of view of modern health policy, Par acelsus cannot be overlooked as he overcame the deductive Aristotelian tradition in medicine and put the practice on a thorough empirical footing. This provides the bas is for sensible statistical investigations that can lead to equally sensible an d helpful policy solutions. The downside is even more important. Many politicians i n Sub-Saharan Africa claim to see a correlation between poverty and AIDS. In thei r view, the therapy would be financial aid to their (perhaps corrupt) government s. 41 From the point of view of Paracelsus, there is no empirically testable theory that can provide a link between poverty and the incidence of AIDS. The current disc ussion about the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is based on the spurious noti on of a correlation between poverty and AIDS. This basically Marxist reasoning is not helpful for current health policy as it neglects Paracelsus' advice to look fo r the causes of a disease at its roots. Claims that the root of a particular disease lies in a socioeconomic aggregate such as poverty can have disastrous effects on both health and economic policy if they are believed. Five hundred years ago, Paracels us tried to overcome such prescientific approaches by establishing relationsh ips between physical, chemical, and economic variables. 41 Governments that are not controlled by a court of audit. 50 References Backhaus, J\u00fcrgen. 1983. \"Competition, Innovation an d Regulation in the Pharmaceutical Industry.\" Managerial and Decision Economics .
