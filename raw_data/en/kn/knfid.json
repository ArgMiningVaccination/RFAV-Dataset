A B S T R A C T Background Hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with many diseases inclu ding atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension and chylomicro naemia. Chinese herbal medicines have been used for a long time as lipid-loweri ng agents. Objectives T o assess the effects and safety of Chinese herbal medicines fo r hypertriglyceridaemia. Search methods We searched a number of databases including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and several Chinese databases (all until May 2012). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in participants with hypertrig lyceridaemia comparing Chinese herbal medicines with placebo, no treat- ment, and pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention s. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently extracted data and assesse d the risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved by discussio n and a decision was achieved based on consensus. We assessed trials fo r risk of bias against key criteria: random sequence generatio n, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, incomplete outcome data , selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Main results We included three randomised trials with 170 participants. Ni nety participants were randomised to the Chinese herbal medi cines groups and 80 to the comparator groups with numbers ranging fr om 50 to 60 participants per trial. The duration of treatment v aried from four to six weeks. All the included trials were conducted in China and published in Chinese. Overall, the risk of bias of i ncluded trials was unclear. There were no outcome data in any of the tria ls on death from any cause, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular eve nts, health-related quality of life, or costs. Three different herbal medicines, including Zhusuan Huoxue evaluated. All three trials investigating Chi nese herbal medicines treatment alone (two studies) or in combi nation with 1 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.gembrozil (one study) reported results on serum triglycerid e (TG) in favour of the herbal treatment. We did not perform a m eta- analysis due to signicant clinical heterogeneity between the studies. No relevant differences in adverse effects occurred and no serio us adverse events were noted. Authors' conclusions The present systematic review suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may have positive effects on hypertriglyceridaemia . The trials did not report serious adverse effects following Chinese herbal medicines treatment. However, based on an unclear risk of bias in included studies and lack of patient-important long-term outcomes, no de nite conclusion could be reached. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia Hypertriglyceridaemia is a condition characterised by increase d blood levels of triglycerides, which constitute one of the blo od lipid components. Hypertriglycerideamia can be divided into primar y and secondary types. Hypertriglyceridaemia is associated wi th many diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertens ion. T o evaluate the effects of various herbal formulations (includ ing single herbs, Chinese proprietary medicines, and mixtur es of different herbs) for treating hypertriglyceridaemia, we examined all available randomised controlled trials of Chinese herbal me dicines. We identied three studies lasting from four to six weeks and re cruiting 170 participants with hypertriglyceridaemia. There were no data on death from any cause, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event s (such as heart attacks or strokes), health-related quality of li fe, or costs. We found that Chinese herbal medicines used alone or in combina tion with lipid-lowering drugs or 'life style' changes may hav e positive effects on reducing the blood levels of triglycerides. No relev ant differences in adverse effects occurred and no serious adver se events were noted. On the basis of the current evidence, no denite conclusion is pos sible especially because of the unclear risk of bias in the includ ed studies and lack of reporting on patient-important long-term o utcomes. 2 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) is a condition characterised by hig h blood levels of triglycerides, constituting one of the blood l ipid components. Hypertriglyceridaemia can be divided into primar y and secondary types. The National Cholesterol Education Pro- gram (NCEP) Adult T reatment Panel III (ATP III) dened el- evated triglycerides as 1.69 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) and higher (NCEP 2001 ). The Third National Health and Nutrition Exami- nation Survey (NHANES) found that approximately 1.7% of the sample had HTG, equating to roughly 3.4 million Americans in the US, adults aged 20 years and older ( Christian 2011 ). The par- ticipants with severe HTG tended to be men (75.3%), non-His- panic whites (70.1%), and aged 40 to 59 years (58.5%) ( Christian 2011 ). The prevalence of HTG was approximately 35% in men and 25% in women in US adults aged 20 years and older ( NCEP 2001 ). The adjusted prevalence of HTG (above 1.70 mmol/L) among adults aged 18 years and older was reported to be 11.9% i n China ( Li 2005 ). The MONICA survey, carried out in three sub- districts in Jakarta in 1993 reported that the prevalence of HT G was 32.1% in males and 20.6% in females ( WHO 2000 ). Hypertriglyceridaemia is often associated with other lipid a bnor- malities and co-exists with other cardiac 'metabolic syndrome' ( Li 2005 ;NCEP 2001 ). Elevated triglycerides often occur in parallel with high level s of cholesterol. While mild-to-moderate HTG is not usually asso- ciated lipaemia retinalis and erup tive xanthomas have been associated with severe HTG which has also been associated with life-threatening acute pancreatitis ( Kumar sociated with many diseases including atherosclerosis, diabe tes, hypertension and chylomicronaemia syndrome ( Anderson 2011 Chait 1992 ;Le 2007 ;Mota 2004 ;Zhang 2011 ). The relationship between HTG and atherosclerosis remains controversial. Meta - analyses of thousands of patients followed up for more than 1 0 years in prospective studies showed that a triglyceride eleva tion of 1 mmol/L (88.8 mg/dL) increased the risk of cardiovascular dis- ease by 32% in men and 76% in women, independent of HDL- C levels ( Hokanson 1996 ). Description of the intervention Clinical practice guidelines by the National Cholesterol Educa tion Program suggest that pharmacotherapy should be considered fo r a triglyceride level over 200 mg/dL which is dened as severe HTG (NCEP 2001 ). With regards to pharmacological treatment, current bric acid derivatives such as gembrozil, bezabrate and fenobrate a re con- sidered the rst choice as they are relatively safe and, in stan - dard doses, it is possible to reduce plasma triglyceride level s byup to 50% ( Barter 2006 ). Other pharmacological therapy used for the Although statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs are ge ner- ally well tolerated, adverse reactions may occur in some patien ts (Beltowski 2009 ;Jacobson 2009 ). For HTG, herbal treatments have been used in patients with car - diovascular problems, pancreatitis, and diabetic ketoacidos is. For example, a composite formula consisting of Panax notoginseng and borneol has been known to decrease serum lipid levels without ad- verse effects on liver function ( Zhang 2007 ). Another more com- plex herbal formula, Daming capsule, has demonstrated bene ts in hypercholesterolaemia and combined lipidaemia ( Jing 2009 ). Chinese herbal medicines used 2006 ;Zhai 2007 ). For the purpose of this review, Chinese herbal medicines are d e- ned as drugs from medicinal plants used for the treatment of HTG. They can be in a form of raw herbs, herbal extracts or herbs formulated into capsules, tablets, decoctions, or injections. Sub- stances such as garlic, evening primrose oil and those that could not be classied as Chinese materia medica are not included. Adverse effects of the intervention Herbal medicines used for lowering blood lipid levels have be en associated with symptoms and signs including reduced appetite , nausea, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, diarr hoea, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and hepatic dysfunction with isolated elevation of alanine-aminotransferase level s (ALT). No serious adverse effects have been reported ( Liu J 2006 ;Liu 2008 ), and the safety prole of herbal medicines in long-term use has not been sufciently assessed. How the intervention might work The mechanisms of action of herbal medicines in lowering blood triglycerides are largely unclear and may be complex; the small body of work in this area has been limited largely to animal ex per- iments. Some potentially active ingredients from medicinal h erbs have been identied. For example, puried Salvia miltiorrhiza ex- tract as a farnesoid X receptor/liver X receptor alpha co-agonist has been shown to improve the lipid proles in hyperlipidaem ic rats ( Ji 2008 ), and the mechanism of Daming capsule on lowering blood lipids may be related to the change of Cx43 ( Xing 2007 ). However, the mechanisms of most herbal medicines for lowering triglycerides are not well dened. Why it is important to do this review Although there is evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCT s) that herbal medicines improve lipid proles, the evidence is b y 4 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.no means conclusive. One review on Chinese red yeast rice for primary hyperlipidaemia inferred short-term benecial effe cts of red yeast rice preparations on lipid modication ( Liu J 2006 ). A systematic review objectively evaluating the existing evid ence on the potential benets and harms of the use of herbal medicines in HTG is needed to update the body of evidence and to help inform clinical decisions. Compared with a previous review on hyperlipidaemia ( Liu J 2006 ), this review will focus on HTG. O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the effects and safety of herbal medicines for hypert riglyc- eridaemia. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with an adequate method of random sequence generation. Adequate methods of sequence generation included computer- generated random numbers, tables of random numbers or draw- ing of lots. We planned to contact authors of RCTs with unclear randomisation methods to decide eligibility of the inclusion when necessary. T ypes of participants Adults (18 years or older) with hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG). Diagnostic criteria We included studies of participants with HTG, dened as a mean triglyceride levels greater than 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Other denitions could be accepted because the diagnostic criteria mig ht have changed during the last decade. We excluded trials of sec- ondary HTG. We did not include studies of participants with bor - derline triglycerides levels of 150 to 199 mg/dL and participa nts with hypercholesterolaemia as a co-factor. T ypes of interventions Intervention Chinese herbal medicines (including medicines from mixtures of herbs, single herbs, Chinese proprietary medici nes,or a formula of herbs prescribed by a Chinese medicine practitioner; we planned to group each category separately whe n conducting comparative analyses; we excluded herbal food or nutritional supplements). Control No treatment. Placebo. Non-traditional Chinese active agents. T ypes of outcome measures Outcome measures sought at the end of treatment and at maximal follow-up after completion of the treatment included the follo w- ing. Primary outcomes Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary interventi on and coronary artery bypass graft), transient ischaemic events (TIA), stroke (fatal and non-fatal, haemorrhagic and non- haemorrhagic)). Death from any cause. Serum triglyceride concentrations. Secondary outcomes Health-related quality of life (evaluated by a validated instrument). Serum cholesterol levels (including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Adverse events (two types of adverse events were analysed, serious adverse events and adverse events not considered ser ious. A serious adverse event was dened as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, is life-threatening, requir es hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisations, res ults in persistent or signicant disability/incapacity, is an event t hat may jeopardise the patient or requires intervention to prevent one of the former serious adverse events ( ICH-GCP 1997 ). All other adverse events were considered non-serious). Costs. Timing of outcome measurement The minimum treatment duration was four weeks. We wanted to explore short-term (less than six months) and long-term (more than six months) duration in a subgroup analysis.

Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We used the following sources for the identication of trials f rom inception to specied date. The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 5) MEDLINE (to May, 2012) EMBASE (to May, 2012) Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (to May, 2012) China National Knowledge Infrastructure (to May, 2012) Chinese VIP Information (to May, 2012) Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database (to May, 2012) We also searched databases of ongoing trials ( http://www.controlled-trials.com/ with links to several databases andhttps://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ ). We to provideinformation, including trial identier, about recognised st udies in the table 'Characteristics of ongoing studies'. For detailed search strategies, please see under Appendix 1 . If additional key words of relevance had been detected during a ny of the electronic or other searches, we would have modied the electronic search strategies to incorporate these terms. We pl anned to include studies published in any language. Searching other resources We tried to identify additional studies by searching the refe rence lists of retrieved included trials and planned to scrutinise (s ystem- atic) reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessme nt re- ports. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T o determine the studies to be assessed further, two review a uthors (ZLL, GQL) independently scanned the abstract, title or both sections of every record retrieved. We investigated all poten tially relevant articles as full text. Where differences in opinion ex isted, they were resolved by a third party. If resolving disagreeme nt had not been possible, we planned to add the article to those 'awai ting classication' and we planned to contact authors for clarication . We attached an adapted PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flow-chart of study sele ction (Figure 1 ) ). 6 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data extraction and management For studies that fullled the inclusion criteria, two review a uthors (ZLL, GQL) independently abstracted relevant population and intervention characteristics using standard data extraction t em- plates (for details see Characteristics of included studies ;Appendix 2;Appendix 3 ;Appendix 4 ;Appendix 5 ;Appendix 6 ;Appendix 7) with any disagreements resolved by discussion, or if requir ed, by a third party. We planned to send an email request to contact persons of pub- lished studies to enquire whether authors were willing to an swer questions regarding their trials if required. The results o f this sur- vey are included in Appendix 8 . Thereafter, we planned to seek rel- evant missing information on the trial from the original aut hor(s) of the article, if required. Dealing with duplicate publications In the case of duplicate publications and companion papers of a primary study, we wanted to maximise yield of information by simultaneous evaluation of all available data.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo review authors (ZLL, GQL) assessed each trial independent ly. We resolved any disagreements by consensus, or by consultatio n with a third party. We assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's t ool (Higgins 2011 ). We used the following criteria. Random sequence generation (selection bias). Allocation concealment (selection bias). Blinding (performance bias and detection bias), separated for blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). Selective reporting (reporting bias). Other bias. We judged risk of bias criteria as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'u nclear risk' and bias items as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). We present a 'Risk of bias' graph ( Figure 2 ) and a 'Risk of bias' summary Figure Figure 2. 'Risk of bias' graph: review authors' judgements a bout each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies. 8 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We assessed the impact of individual bias domains on study res ults at endpoint and study levels. Measures of treatment effect We expressed dichotomous data as risk ratio (RR) with 95% con- dence intervals (CI) and continuous data as differences in mean s (MD) with 95% CI. Unit of analysis issues We planned to take into account the level at which randomisation occurred, such as cross-over trials, cluster-randomised trials an d multiple observations for the same outcome, if required. Dealing with missing data We performed evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, randomised patients as well as intention-to-treat (I TT), as-treated and per-protocol (PP) populations. We investigated at- trition rates, for example drop-outs, losses to follow-up and with- drawals and critically appraised issues of missing data and im - putation methods (for example last-observation-carried-forwa rd (LOCF)). Assessment of heterogeneity In the event of substantial clinical or methodological or stati stical heterogeneity, we planned not to report study results as met a- analytically pooled effect estimates. We wanted to identify heterogeneity by visual inspection of t he forest plots and by using a standard Chi2test with a signicance level of = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test. We would have specically examined heterogeneity employing the I2statis- tic, which quanties inconsistency across studies, to assess the im- pact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis ( Higgins 2002 ;Higgins 2003 ), where an I2statistic of 75% and more indicated a consid- erable level of inconsistency ( Higgins 2011 ). When heterogeneity was found, we planned to determine poten- tial reasons for it by examining individual study and subgro up characteristics. We expected the following characteristics to introduce clinical he t- erogeneity. Age. Gender. Compliance. Comorbidity. Disease duration. Dose. T reatment course. Dosing frequency.Assessment of reporting biases Funnel plots would have been used for 10 or more studies to ass ess small study bias. Data synthesis We planned primarily to summarise low-risk of bias data by mea ns of a random-effects model. We would have performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines referenced in the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We planned to carry out subgroup analyses of the primary out- come parameter(s) (see above) and investigate interaction. If a suf- cient number of randomised trials were identied, we would h ave performed subgroup analyses according to formulation of herb s (extract, single herb, or mixture of herbs), and treatment dura tion (short-term and long-term). The following subgroup analyses were planned. Formulation of herbs (extract, single herb, or mixture of herbs). T reatment duration (no more than six months and more than six months). Sensitivity analysis We planned to perform sensitivity analyses in order to explo re the influence of the following factors on effect size. Restricting the analysis to published studies. Restricting the analysis taking account risk of bias, as specied above. Restricting the analysis to very long or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results. Restricting the analysis to studies using the following lte rs: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of fundi ng (industry versus other), country, trials with signicant skewe d distributions of participants in groups ( Pocock 1990 ). We also wanted to test the robustness of the results by repeat ing the analysis using different measures of effect size (RR, odds ratio (OR), etc.) and different statistical models (xed-effect and ran- dom-effects models). R E S U L T S 10 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Description of studies Results of the search The initial search using the electronic search strategies list ed in the appendices yielded 1952 studies. T welve unpublished studie s were identied. After duplicates of different databases were rem oved, 1875 potentially relevant articles were kept for further ass essment. After scanning the studies identied, we recognised 10 studie s that could not be excluded by scrutiny of the title and abstract only. Further investigation of the full articles revealed three in cluded studies (three included publications). Seven studies were exclu ded and the reasons for exclusion are listed under ' Characteristics of excluded studies '. We prepared a PRISMA flow diagram to de- scribe the articles found from our searches ( Figure 1 ). No differ- ence on the assessment on the eligibility of the studies was fo und between the two authors. Missing data There were no missing data In the three included studies. Dealing with duplicate or companion publications We did not nd duplicate or companion documents of primary publications. Included studies Three randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were included in this re - view. Further details are given in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' table. All trials employed a parallel two-arm design. None of the studies compared Chinese herbal medicines versus placeb o. Each of the three comparisons: Chinese herbal medicines versus benzbromarone, Chinese herbal medicines plus gembrozil ve rsus gembrozil and Chinese herbal medicines plus lifestyle inte rven- tion versus fenobrate plus lifestyle intervention was tes ted in one trial, respectively. All the included studies were published studies. Participants One trial did not specify the diagnostic criteria ( Liu 2008 ); the other two trials specied the diagnostic criteria of the parti ci- pants in the publications ( Miao 2008 ;Tan 2010 ). All three trials specied exclusion criteria . None of the included trials specie d the number of screened populations. A total of 170 participant s with hypertriglyceridaemia were included in the three trials ; all recruited from Chinese populations. All of the randomised pa rtic- ipants completed the study. One trial reported that the age of the participants ranged from 25 to 71 years ( Miao 2008 ). The other two trials did not report the age range of the participants ( Liu 2008 ;Tan 2010 ). One trial did not report the number of maleand female participants ( Tan 2010 ). Among the 120 participants in two trials, the proportion of males to females was 65 to 55. One trial included both inpatients and outpatients ( Liu 2008 ). T wo trials did not specify the setting ( Miao 2008 ;Tan 2010 ). The pertinent patient populations of the included studies are sh own in Table 1 . Interventions In total, three different herbal medicines were tested ( Table 2 ; Appendix 2 ). The formulations of all the tested herbal medicines were decoctions. Three different herbal medicines, evaluated in the included trials. The three formu- lae each contained more than nine herbal ingredients, belongi ng to three classes in traditional Chinese medicine: herbs for to nify- ing qi, such as Astragalus membranaceous, which appeared in all the three formulas, herbs for removing dampness; such as Poria cocos,Rheum palmatum, Plantago asiatica; and herbs for promoting as Saliva miltiorrhiza, Carthamus tincto- rius, andPanax notoginseng. No trial reported quality standards of the herbal preparati ons. The control interventions included lifestyle intervention, fen obrate capsules, gembrozil tablets and benzbromarone tablets. Th e du- ration of treatment varied from four to six weeks. Outcomes None of the trials reported outcomes on cardiovascular and cere- brovascular events or death from any cause. Serum triglyceride levels (TG) and adverse effects were reported in all studies. Uric acid levels were reported in two studies ( Liu 2008 ;Tan 2010 ). Symptoms were reported in one study ( Tan 2010 ). Detailed in- formation is shown in Appendix 5 . Study details None of the three studies mentioned whether they had a run-in period and all the studies terminated as scheduled. Publication details T wo of the three studies were published in 2008 ( Liu 2008 ;Miao 2008 ) and one in 2010 ( Tan 2010 ). All three studies were con- ducted in China and all were published in peer-reviewed jour- nals in Chinese. None of the trials were claimed as commercially funded. 11 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

They were excluded due to ineligi ble participants, or non-eligible interventions, or missing ela boration of methods of random sequence generation. Detailed informat ion is shown in Characteristics of excluded studies . Risk of bias in included studies The trial reports provided very limited information about d esign and methodology. No multi-centre RCTs were identied in our searches. None of the trials reported a sample size calculation . None of the trials stated that they performed an intention-to -treat analysis, but missing data were not reported in the trials. A ssess- ment of risk of bias is described for each included study in the Characteristics of included studies table. Review authors' judge- ments about each 'Risk of bias' item is presented as percentage s across all included studies in Figure 2 , and review authors' judge- ments about each 'Risk of bias' item for each included study is shown in Figure 3 . No difference emerged on the assessment of risk of bias of the included studies between review authors. Allocation All the studies reported an adequate random sequence genera- tion. Detailed information is shown in Characteristics of included studies andFigure 3 . Blinding None of the studies reported blinding. Detailed informatio n is shown in the Characteristics of included studies table and Figure 3. Incomplete outcome data Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed in all stud ies. Detailed information is shown in the Characteristics of included studies table and Figure 3 . Selective reporting None of the trials had a published protocol. According to the nominated outcomes in the methods section and the reported outcomes in the results section, we made a judgement on this domain. T wo trials were free of selective reporting ( Liu 2008 ;Tan 2010 ). Detailed information is shown in the Characteristics of included studies table and Figure 3 . Other potential sources of bias We did not detect any specic type of other potential risk of bia s.Effects of interventions See:Summary of ndings for the main comparison Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia Primary Outcomes Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events None of the trials reported these outcomes. Death from any cause None of the trials reported this outcome. Serum triglyceride concentrations Serum triglyceride concentrations (TG) were reported in all th ree studies. Compared to benzbromarone tablets, Chushihuayu d e- coction showed benecial effects on lowering TG with a mean difference (MD) of -1.14 mmol/L (95% condence interval (CI) -1.40 to -0.88; Huoxue decoction did not show benecial effects on lowering TG with a MD of - 0.32 mmol/L (95% CI -0.69 to -0.05; 60 showed reducing the number of patients with TG 2.2 mmol/L or more with a RR of 0.20 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; 60 participants, 1 trial; Analysis 2.2 ). Compared to fenobrate plus lifestyle intervention, signi cantly higher TG levels were reported in the Zhusuan Huoxue decoction plus lifestyle intervention group with a MD of 0.51 mmol/L (95 % CI 0.31 to 0.71; 60 participants; 1 trial; Analysis 3.1 ). Secondary Outcomes Health-related quality of life None of the trials reported this outcome. Serum cholesterol levels None of the trials reported this outcome. Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) None of the trials reported these outcomes. 12 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Adverse r eac- tions including gastrointestinal adverse reactions, renal co lic, acute arthritis ( Tan 2010 ), abdominal discomfort ( Miao 2008 ) and el- evated alanine-aminotransferase levels (ALT) ( Liu 2008 ) were re- ported. When comparing fenobrate plus lifestyle interventi on versus Zhusan Huoxue decoction plus lifestyle intervention ( Liu 2008 ), there was a higher number of individuals with elevated ALT (two versus zero cases, respectively - Analysis 3.2 ). Other compar- isons also did not reveal statistically signicant difference s between intervention and comparator groups ( Analysis 1.2 ;Analysis 1.3 ; Analysis 1.4 ;Analysis 1.5 ;Analysis 2.3 ). Costs None of the trials reported this outcome. Reporting biases We did not construct funnel plots to examine for publication and small study bias because we could not perform a meta-analysis in this systematic review. When there are fewer than 10 studies i n a comparison, it is difcult to assess asymmetry by visual exami na- tion, and the power of the funnel plot test is too low to distin - guish chance from real asymmetry ( Higgins 2011 ). None of the included trials was a non-published study. None of the included trials had multiple publications. Subgroup analyses No subgroup analyses were done due to the limited number of trials. Sensitivity analyses No sensitivity analyses were done due to the limited number o f trials. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 170 participan ts are included in this review. The present systematic review su ggests that Chinese herbal medicines used alone or in combination wit h other lipid-lowering drugs or lifestyle changes may have posi tive effects on reducing the blood levels of triglycerides (TG). How- ever, the Chinese herbal medicine interventions did not show con- sistent effects on serum TG concentrations. gembrozil showed benecial effects on reducing the number of patients with a TG of 2.2 mmol/L and more, while higher TG levels were reported in the Zhusuan Huoxue decoction plus lifestyle intervention group. No serio us adverse events were reported. However, denite conclusions o n the efcacy of Chinese herbal medicines could not be reached because of the mostly unclear risk of bias in studies and lack of reporti ng on patient-important and long-term outcomes. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The age and gender of participants in the included trials were representative of hypertriglyceridaemic persons. All part icipants were recruited from Chinese populations and this could impact t he applicability of the interventions to other populations. No long- term data on outcomes were reported in the included trials. Man y types of Chinese herbal medicines with possible lipid-loweri ng effects have not been investigated in RCTs. Quality of the evidence All of the RCTs included in this review showed a mostly unclear risk of bias in more than one 'Risk of bias' domains. Study pub - lications provided only limited descriptions of study design , al- location concealment and baseline data. No multi-centre, large scale RCTs were found. Methodologically poorly designed tria ls show larger differences between experimental and control gro ups than those conducted rigorously ( Kjaergard 2001 ;Moher 1998 ; Schulz 1995 ). However, the insufcient number of adequate tri- als prohibited us from performing meaningful sensitivity a nalyses to show how robust the results of the review are after restrict ing analyses to trials with adequate methodology. Moreover, th e in- cluded trials were heterogeneous in the interventions (three dif- ferent herbal medicines tested only once). Potential biases in the review process Although we conducted comprehensive searches, we only iden- tied and included three trials; all of them were conducted and published in Chinese. All of the trials had small sample size s. We tried to avoid language bias and location bias, but we could not exclude potential dissemination bias. We have undertaken ex ten- sive searches for unpublished material, few of the trials ide ntied qualied for inclusion, but at the same time we cannot disregar d the fact that trials with negative ndings might remain unpub - lished. 13 Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia (Revi ew) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews T o our knowledge, no systematic review has been undertaken w ith a focus on Chinese herbal medicines for hypertriglyceridaemia . A systematic review on Chinese red yeast rice for dyslipidaemi a was published in 2006 ( Liu J 2006 ). This review included 93 trials with red yeast rice as the intervention and placebo as the control. Pa - tients with primary hyperlipidaemia were included. Meta-ana lyses were conducted by grouping different controls and the conclusion of the review was that current evidence from randomised trials shows short-term benecial effects of red yeast rice preparatio ns on lipid modication ( Liu J 2006 ). None of the trials from Liu J 2006 were included in our review. We excluded studies mostly because the participants were not patients with hypertriglyceridaem ia, and therefore, did not meet our inclusion criteria. Though the two reviews did not focus on the same events, the conclusions of the review ( Liu J 2006 ) and this review are similar as hyperlipidaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are closely related. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Based on this systematic review, we cannot be certain of the ef - cacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment ofhypertriglyceridaemia. The evidence is inconclusive due to sma ll number of included studies, unclear risk of bias in major domai ns and the inconsistency of results in the included studies. Implications for research For herbal mixtures, rigorous description of the pharmacolog y of the interventions and clinical outcomes should be emphasised. Future studies should be carried out on a formula based on our three included trials and in multiple trial centres. Standard ised monitoring and reporting should be used for assessment of ad verse events. Evaluation of patient-important and long-term outcom es is necessary.
