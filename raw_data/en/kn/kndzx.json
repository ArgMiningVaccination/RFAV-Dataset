KPU offers bachelor's degrees, associate degrees, diplomas, certificates and citations in more than 140 programs spanning diverse educational areas: trades, vocational, preparatory, academic and professional. Designated as a Polytechnic University in 2008, KPU continues to prepare its students for successful careers as well as help them develop the skills and critical awareness to be responsible citizens and community leaders. Almost 20,000 students annually attend courses at KPU campuses in Surrey, Richmond, Langley and Cloverdale . As a regional polytechnic university that focuses on teaching and learning, KPU currently offers a range of credentials, many of which are unique, to successfully meet the evolving needs of regional and global employment markets. As a leader in innovativ e education, KPU creates relevant and engaging programs that integrate a broad -based university education, community service opportunities, undergraduate and applied research experience, and essential skills practice. The culture at KPU is learner- focused, academically rigorous, innovative, interdisciplinary and socially responsible. Students at KPU have the opportunity to bridge certificate and diploma credentials into bachelor's degrees, creating the option of academic and professional enhancement of appl ied and technical programs. Arising from its commitment to serve the Fraser Region, KPU offers all learners, regardless of background and preparation, and from across the country and abroad, opportunities to achieve the highest standards of academic perfor mance. Access and support services, multiple entry points, and bridging programs are examples of this commitment. Transition programs, international education, workplace experiences and continuing education are also part of Kwantlen' s commitment to lifelo ng learning across a broad range of educational options. Our university culture is based on critical inquiry, collegial debate, knowledge generation, freedom of expression, diversity, and environmental stewardship and sustainability. Strategic Plan: KPU Strategic Plan (Appendix A) Academic Plan: KPU Academic Plan (Appendix B) b) Proposed credential to be awarded, including the level and category of the degree and the specific discipline or field of study Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine c) Location Kwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 4 of 18 August 31, 2022 The Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BTCM) program will be offered at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Richmond campus. d) Faculty(ies) or school(s) offering the proposed new degree program The Faculty of Health will be offering the proposed Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine degree. e) Anticipated program start date The anticipated start date of the program is September 1, 2024. f) Anticipated completion time in years or semesters Students engaged in full -time study will be able to complete the Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 9 semesters. The initial 6 semesters lead to a Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture. 3 further semesters will lead to a Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine. g) A summary of the proposed program The Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a 9 -semester program that qualifies a student both to apply for registration as a Registered Acupuncturist, after term 6, and as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner, after term 9. 1 A student may complete only the first 6 terms of the program and graduate with a Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture (an existing KPU credential). A student may complete the Diploma in Acupuncture and use all 86 credits of that credential towards their Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Aims, goals, and or objectives of the proposed program The aim of the proposed Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BTCM) program is to develop graduates who will become competent Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners able to combine rese arch and critical thinking in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. This practice will rely on deep understanding of the evolving healthcare delivery environment of British Columbia, as well as the similarities and differences between Western medicine, biomedical science, and TCM. Its disciplinary foci will be herbal treatment, advanced acupuncture, TCM theory, TCM practice and philosophy. Graduates will be prepared, through practice management courses and applied practice, to successfully operate their own practices. Anticipated contribution of the proposed program to the mandate and strategic plan of the institution The proposed BTCM, with its accessible curricular structure, supports both KPU's Vision 2023 and Academic Plan 2023. One of the top priorities stated in KPU's strategic plan , Vision 2023 , is to \"reflect and serve our diverse, dynamic and growing region by providing a wide range of offerings, services and activities.\" In a city like Richmond, reflecting and serving the community includes reflecting and serving its vibrant Chinese -Canadian community. In a province like British Columbia, which has the highest rates of lifetime usage of complementa ry and alternative medicine in Canada (CAM) (Feasibility Assessment, p. 3), that reflection and service includes educating 1 Depending on previous educational experiences, students may also require 60 additional credits in arts and sciences to qualify f or CTCMA registration as a TCM Practitioner . https://www.ctcma.bc.ca/media/1942/ctcma - bylaws -and-schedules.pdf Kwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 5 of 18 August 31, 2022 future professionals to safely deliver CAM treatment. Establis hing British Columbia's first public TCM program is a chance both to reflect and serve our local community, and to reflect and serve the Province of British Columbia. It increases our ability to embrace all cultures (Goal B1) and to enrich the experience o f TCM students in BC by offering its first public teaching clinic (Goal A1). The BTCM also substantially enhances our ability to meet our goals under Academic Plan 2023. It involves interdisciplinary curricula in acupuncture, herbology, modern language, English and philosophy (Strategy 1.1), includes rigorous applied learning in our teaching clinic (Strategies 1.7, 2.4 and 2.5), draws on cross -cultural knowledge practices (Strategy 4.2) and builds a new pathway for our Diploma in TCM - Acupuncture students to advance their skills and careers (Strategy 4.4). The proposed program is, in short, a chance to advance some of our most important moral commitments to our community whilst also offerings high quality public educational experiences in a province that to day has no access to such experiences. Linkages between the learning outcomes and the curriculum design, an indication whether a work experience/workplace term is required for degree completion, and if so a description of the purpose and role of the wor k experience within the program Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) A student who has graduated from the Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine will have reliably demonstrated the ability to: 1. Apply the techniques of acupuncture, herbal medicine and Tuina -Anmo/Chinese massage 2. Identify in context the appropriate scope of practice for TCM practitioners in modern health care 3. Synthesize TCM diagnoses using clinical data, disorder patterns and other patient information 4. Communicate effectively with clients, colle agues, and other health care providers 5. Provide client education on issues of illness prevention, wellness, and healthy lifestyles 6. Assess health care research in and outside of TCM contexts 7. Manage a TCM Practice . The program learning outcomes (PLOs) are taught by courses in 5 broad categories. Students will learn the historical and philosophical underpinnings of Traditional Chinese Medicine in courses like ACUP 1100 Acupuncture Fundamental Theory and ASIA 1210 East Asian Health and Philosophy , while studying theoretical content in courses such as ACUP 1230 Acupuncture Meridian and Acupoint . 1. Essential TCM Foundations This component of the program will provide students with a solid understanding of the history and philosophical underpinnings of TCM, gained fr om the study of source documents. This will include study of the Chinese language, the Yijing (the Book of Changes), TCM theory and Kwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 6 of 18 August 31, 2022 diagnosis, meridians and acupoints, acupuncture technique and safety, herbology and herbal formulas. E xample courses: ACU P 1100 Fundamental Theory, ASIA 1210 East Asian Health and Philosophy, ACUP 1230 Meridian and Acupoint. 2.W estern Biomedical Science This program is designed to develop the student's understanding of Western medicine and provide basic knowledge and skills to communicate with Western medical professionals andthe public. The biomedical science component includes an introduction to biomedicalfoundation, medical biochemistry and microbiology, pathology, Western diagnosis (imagingand lab testing) and Western pharmacology. Example courses: ACUP 1260 Acupuncture Biochemistry and Microbiology, ACUP 2160 Acupuncture Western Medical Diagnosis (Imaging and Testing) 3.TCM Clinical Medicine The TCM Clinical Medicine component includes acupuncture therapy, TCM internal medicine, TCM gynecology, TCM dermatology and external diseases, TCM traumatology andorthopedics, TCM pediatrics, Five Sense Organ Diseases and herbal case studies. Thiscomponent aims to develop the student's techniques and effective use of tools. Practical skills involving communication and psychomotor activity are learned in a practical classroom, lab,or simulation lab, where models or fellow students simulate patients or profession al c olleagues. Course content will provide students with opportunities to develop a solid theoretical and conceptual base and the requisite analytical skills to think critically andaddress complex issues thoroughly and methodically. In each of the TCM clinical medicinecourses, students will directly apply the conceptual and practical learning from previous o r c oncurrent courses. The design of the program blends theory, practice, and application, providing students with opportunities to apply newly acquired knowledge and skills inprogressively more complex clinical situatio clinical practicum component fosters effective applications of theory to practice. The program has been designed to follow a series of clinical education pathways with increasing levels of responsibility from introduction to the TCM clinic, to clinic observation, patient assessments, and ultimately, supervised practice. Students will be required to analyzeproblems to identify underlying hea lth-related issues, critically assess relevant practice and research, propose treatment principles, deliver treatment protocols or performancetherapies, and evaluate their effectiveness. The applied practice components occur under th e c lose supervision of experienced, registered, and licensed faculty. This component focuses on hands -on development of techniques, effective use of tools and applied processes. Th e c linical practica will take place in the KPU student clinic at the Richmond campus as well as in community care facilities such as Villa Cathay and will involve students working directly withKwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 7 of 18 August 31, 2022 patients. The Faculty of Health will explore the use of the Health Student Placement Network (HSPnet) for provincial placements. E xample courses: TCME 4280 S upervised Practice VI components of the program include Taiji/Qigong, Shiliao/Chinese medicated diet, practice management, communication, and professional ethics. Taiji and Shiliao coursesprovide students with the knowledge and practical asp ects of self -wellness in addition to teaching the public about health promotion. Practice management courses will broaden agraduate's perspective and assist them in understanding and applying business practices, marketing, and ethics in the management of a clinic or their own business. Potential areas/sectors of employment for graduates and/or opportunities for further study In a s tudy of naturopaths, homeopaths, and TCM/acupuncture practitioners, Ijaz ) 2 found that 76% of TCM/acupuncture practitioners were working 30 hours or more per week (36.5 hours on average) and treated an average of 27.3 patients per week. British Columbia has even higher rates of usage for complementary and alternative medicine. As noted in the attached feasibility assessment, 89% of BC residents have used such health care services. -the highest in Canada. The graduates of the proposed program can expect to obtain employment within the Practitioners of Natural Healing occupational category. They will be employable primarily inthe private sector, with potential job titles including, but not limited to: TCM practitioner,Acupuncturist, Herbalist. Graduates may establish a private practice, join a team practice, or find employment within clinics, health clubs and spas. Although TCM practitioners currently comprise a small component of the Natural Healing sector, the graduates of the proposedprogram face generally positive prospects as this sector grows. With a Bachelor's degree, the graduates of the proposed BTCM progr am will further have the opportunity to continue their studies in graduate programs. Delivery methods The proposed Bachelor of TCM program will be delivered face -to-face by faculty and clinic supervisors. Didactic courses will be delivered in classrooms or simulation labs. The practicum courses will be delivered in the KPU student clinic on the Richmond campus as well as incommunity care facilities. Program strengths T he proposed program builds on existing and successful TCM Acupuncture programming at KPU. 2 Ijaz, N., Welsh, S., Zhang, Q., Brule, D., & Boon, H. (2021). A cross -sectional workforce survey of three traditional and complementary medicine professions in Ontario, Canada. PLOS One, 16(5). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250223 Kwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 8 of 18 August 31, 2022 A state- of-the-art Acupuncture lab already exists and a Herbology dispensary and client interview rooms will be added. KPU has developed strong working relationships with key partners in the Tradition al C hinese Medicine community. The program enjoys strong connec tions with industry, including representation at the biannual TCM PAC meeting, which provides program input and direction. Support from the CTCMA, BC TCM community and the Chinese community. No other TCM program is offered within the public post -secondary system in BC. KPU's proposed BTCM program is unique in that it will be the only program in its area offered at a public post -secondary institution in B.C., and will be the only program in Canad a w here students can earn an accredited BTCM degree upon gradua tion. An overview of the level of support and recognition from other post-s econdary institutions, and relevant regulatory or professional bodies, where applicable, and plans for admissions and transfer within the British Columbia post-s econdary education system The reputation of a public university is globally recognized. The KPU Bachelor of TCM (BTCM) program will be included in directories of recommended TCM institutes world-w ide, benefitting international students wishing to study in Canada, and facilitating articulation for program graduates into graduate studies. KPU will be the first Canadian public university to offer a Bachelor of TCM program. Program support from the regulatory body CTCMA and the British Columbia Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Practitioners (ATCMA) has been i n place since the program vision was established i n September 2016 (Appendix F BC ATCMA Support Letter). Students admitted to the BTCM may request Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) for courses comprising the requirements of the Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture. Students will be required to satisfy any outstanding requirements if RPL is not granted for all required courses within the Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture, in order to satisfy the curricular requirements of the BTCM. Related programs in the institution or other British Columbia post-s econdary institutions. Indicate rationale for duplication, if any. While several B.C.-b ased institutions offer similar practitioner programs in TCM - including five in the Lower Mainland - none are offered within the public post-s econdary system. These programs, and their respective lengths and tuition levels, are included in the attached feasibility assessment (page 7). h) Name, title, phone number and e- mail address of the institutional contact person in case mor e i nformati on is required.

The curriculum also includes courses that advance student understanding of English and Chinese medical language skills and communication, Asian philosophy, and Western biomedical sciences. Students will blend theory with practice and clinical application during their practica. All of these courses are necessary for developing critical thinking and synthesis of complex concepts. As noted above the program learning outcomes for the BTCM are as follows. Program learning outcomes A student who has grad uated from the Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine will have reliably demonstrated the ability to: 1.Apply the techniques of acupuncture, herbal medicine and Tuina -Anmo/Chinese massage 2.Identify in context the appropriate scope of practice for TCM pract itioners in modern health care 3.Synthesize TCM diagnoses using clinical data, disorder patterns and other patient information 4.Communicate effectively with clients, colleagues, and other health care providers 5.Provide client education on issues of illness prevention, wellness, and healthy lifestyles 6.Assess health care research in and outside of TCM contexts 7.Manage a TCM Practice . Program Structure and Length The Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BTCM) is a 4.5-year , 9 semester, 127 credit program that combines Acupuncture and Herbology. The program will be comprised of the courses in KPU's existing Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture and an additional 41 credits of TCM Practitioner courses. Students who wish to exit the program after successful completion up to the end of term 6 may choose to exit the program with the Diploma in TCM - Acupuncture. Should that student choose to return to complete the BTCM, they may use all 86 credits of that credential towards their Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The BTCM will provide the areas of study required by the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia (CTCMA) to practice Traditional Chinese Medicine as a registered practitioner (RTCM.P) following successful completion of the registration exam 3 and any Arts and Sciences credits the student had not obtained in their previous education (up to 60 credits). These credits may also be earned at KPU. The BTCM adds to the existing Traditional C hinese Medicine -Acupuncture Diploma program foundations in herbology, herbal formulas, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinical courses and practice hours. Students will integrate theory with practice as they progress throughout the program, with re gular experiential learning opportunities spread through 6 practica and supervised practice courses. In addition to the core herbology courses the curriculum will expand and build upon concepts and skills developed in KPU's 3 https:// www.ctcma.bc.ca/quality -practice/entry -level -tcm-competencies/ Kwantlen Polytechnic University Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine FPP, Page 10 of 18 August 31, 2022 Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture program. This will further prepare learners for the application of critical thinking during diagnosis and treatment(s), as well as synthesis of complex concepts. Courses in herbalist practice transition and supplemental Mandarin language studies will prepare learners with the communication skills needed for future practic e as TCM Practitioners. BTCM students will also study health research. The first 6 terms of the program consists of the existing 86 -credit Faculty of Health Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture, wherein students undertake a total of three academic years that are condensed into two calendar years. Terms 7, 8 and 9 consist of 41 additional credits of herbology and clinical practice, as well as health research, to fulfill the 127 credit requirement of the BTCM degree. These additional 41 credits may be completed on a part -time basis or in three semesters of full-time study. Students with an acupuncture diploma recognized by the CTCMA, or who are Registered Acupuncturists with the CTCMA, are eligible for prior learning assessment credit for adva nced standing.
