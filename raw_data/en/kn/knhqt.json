TO THE HONORABLE DAVID Y. IGE, CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE: My name is Dr. Kevin Gibson, member of the Board of Naturopathic Medicine (\"Board\"). The Board appreciates the opportunity to present testimony on Senate Bill No. 2489, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine. The purpose of Senate Bill No. 2489 is to remove the Board's authority to establish the education and training requirements for parenteral therapy and the standards to administer parenteral therapy; establish examination standards for and to require the passage of an examination on minor office procedures; and establish and publish a naturopathic formulary. The Board has not had the opportunity to meet and establish an official position. However, the Board is scheduled to meet on Friday, February 19, 2010 to discuss Senate Bill No. 2489. Subsequent to the meeting, the Board will be able to report back to you regarding their official position on this bill. Although the Board has not yet met to discuss this bill, the Board supported the passage of Act 22, special session 2009 (Act 22), which gave the Board the authority to Testimony on Senate Bill No. 2489 Wednesday, February 3, 2010 Page 2 establish requirements for parenteral therapy and minor office procedures and to establish and publish a naturopathic formulary. Since the enactment of Act 22, the Board has been actively developing and drafting the education and training requirements for parenteral therapy; standards for parenteral therapy; examination requirements for minor office procedures; and standards of practice, care and ethics. The Board has also established and published a naturopathic formulary that is consistent with naturopathic medical practice. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on Senate Bill No. 2489. UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I SYSTEM Legislative Testimony Written Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Health February 3,2010,3:00 p.m. By Virginia S. Hinshaw, Chancellor And Jerris R. Hedges, MD, MS, MMM Dean and Professor of Medicine Barry & Virginia Weinman Endowed Chair John A. Burns School of Medicine University of Hawai'i at Manoa Senator Ige and colleagues, we wish to speak in support of SB 2489 that removes full prescriptive authority from Naturopathic Practitioners. The public should be aware that the education of Naturopathic Practitioners is quite different from that of Allopathic Physicians -for example, as trained at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, John A. Burns School of Medicine. Although Naturopathic Practitioners have a valuable role to play on the healthcare team, their classroom education is largely limited to undergraduate college-level basic science courses and less than one year of full-time clinical exposure. At this point, the Naturopathic trainee is ready to prescribe whatever medicines are on the state Naturopathic formulary. In contrast, following a college degree that includes many of the courses taught to Naturopathic Practitioners, the medical student at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, John A. Burns School of Medicine must subsequently complete two full years of graduate level basic science followed by two full years of clinical training in a breadth of clinical settings and practice specialties. Following four years of medical school, the graduate of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, John A. Burns School of Medicine must complete an additional three to six year residency training program to become licensed and boarded in a specialty area such as internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics\u00ad gynecology, psychiatry, pathology, surgery or family medicine. At that point, the Allopathic Physician has full prescribing authority. In a recently passed bill, Naturopathic Practitioners were given the ability to prescribe not only natural herbal products and vitamins, but also ANY drug that their self\u00ad regulated formulary board desired. Antibiotics, cardiac medications, and cancer drugs are strong medications for those with such limited training and clinical experience to prescribe. It would seem prudent, for the safety of the people of Hawai'i, that the legislature either approve a formulary more aligned with the training of these practitioners or modify the Naturopathic formulary board to have a balancing participation by Allopathic Physicians and Pharmacists to address which medicines would be prescribed by Naturopathic Practitioners. As someone who has served as a preceptor for Naturopathic trainees in my former faculty role in Oregon, I am very aware of the practice strengths and limitations of these allies in healthcare delivery. It is hoped that we can thoughtfully define a formulary that permits the safe practice of Naturopathic Practitioners in Hawai'i. 2 02-02-'10 15:57 FROM-HAWAII MEDICAL ASSOC 808-528-2376 HAWAII MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 1360 S.

Legislative Co-Chair Linda Rasmussen, MD, Legislative Co-Chair April Donahue, Executive Director Lauren Zirbel, Government Affairs Dick Botti, Government Affairs Re: SB2489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE In Support Chairs & Committee Members: T-247 P0001/0003 F-359 Hawaii Medical Association supports SB2489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine. This measure would help ensure the safety of Hawaii patients. Naturopathic medicine, while a sound option for some citizens of our state, is not the same as allopathic (MDs) or osteopathic (DOs) medicine, and has fewer standards and requirements for training and licensure. Prescriptive authority of naturopathic doctors should not be viewed as an access issue, but instead a patient safety issue and should be handled very cautiously. Compared to medical school and residency training, a naturopathic education consists of relatively few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease, and provides virtually no clinical reinforcement of pharmaceutical intervention on patients during clinical rotations or optional post\u00ad graduate training. One important component to consider in the debate over naturopath prescriptive authority is whether a practitioner with such limited exposure to pharmaceuticals can appropriately treat patients who take prescription medicines regularly or who would likely benefit from pharmacological intervention. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are required to take just 7-11 credits of pharmacology and just 850 clock hours of clinical training in patient care. Only one state requires any post-graduate training for NOs (Utah -one year). Only 11 other states allow some prescriptive authority for NOs, and the vast majority are much more limiting than in Hawaii (such as allowing for only natural and homeopathic medicines). Additionally. many of those states require some type of MD or DO involvement, whether at the board level or the individual practitioner level. For comparison in Hawaii, a joint formulary advisory committee for APRNs requires representation by MDs and/or DOs appointed by the Hawaii Medical Board. while the naturopathic board has no representation at this level of expertise, The same representation should have at a very minimum been required of the naturopathic board to determine formulary, or at least it should be the responsibility of the Hawaii Medical Board. The American Medical Association agrees that Nurse Practitioner or APRN training is in the same vein of evidence-based medicine as MD/DO training. Analysis of NO curriculum, training and text does not lead to the same conclusion. (cont. next page) OFFICERS President -Robert MalVit. MEDICAL ASSOC 808-528-2376 February 3,2010,3:00 p.m., CR Senate Committee on Health Page 2 T-247 P0002/0003 F-359 There are 36 states that do not license NDs. South Carolina and Tennessee expressly prohibit the practice of naturopathy. Florida abolished Its naturopath licensing laws, and in 2004 a legislative committee concluded that an expanded scope might be harmful, Several other states, including Texas and Virginia, have abolished previous naturopathy licensure provisions. Of the 14 states that do license NDs (plus the District of Columbia), most have continuing education requirements, while Hawaii does not. The concem for patient safety is even more critical in light of the public confusion regarding qualifications of non-MO and non-DO health care practitioners such as naturopathic doctors. It is also important to note that Medicare and Medicaid Hawaii do not reimburse for naturopathic services, and many of Hawaii's health plans do not. NO scope of practice cannot adequately address access to care for the majority of Hawaii's population. In closing, we ask you to please consider the following facts that highlight the differences in education and training between NDs and MDsIDOs: Applicant Comparison: Applicants to become a Medical Doctor -Average GPA: 3.66 -Average MCAT: not required (Sources: American Association of Medical Colleges, www.aamc.org/data/facts/2008/2008mcatgpa.htm; AMA Scope of Practice Data Series -Naturopaths.

February 2,2010 HEARING: Wednesday, February 3,2010, 3:00pm Conference Room 016 TO: Senator David Y. Ige, Chair State Senator Josh Green, MD, Vice-Chair State Senate Committee on Health FROM: Gary A. Okamoto, MD Board Certified in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation RE: SB2489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE In Support I stand in support of SB 2489, which shapes the scope of practice for Doctors of Naturopathy in the area of prescription drugs for their patients. SB 2489 respectfully acknowledges the unique practice of naturopathic medicine and recommends a mechanism by which licensed Doctors of Medicine (MDs) and/or Doctors of Osteopathy (DOs) may apply their pharmacologic expertise to the development of a naturopathic drug formulary. Prescriptive authority of doctors of naturopathy is an issue of patient safety, not access. Doctors of naturopathy undergo education and training different from the intensity of pharmacologic education and training of MDs, DOs, nurse practitioners, and advanced nurse practitioners. In the current situation, unlimited prescribing authority by the naturopathic doctor increases the risk of preventable complications or unnecessary drug use. At the heart of the issue is that allopathic schooling among MDs, DOs, and nurses is founded on evidence-based treatment -an approach that is different in its entirety and intensity and depth from the unique natural and non-drug approach of naturopathic doctors. I respectfully urge you to support SB 2489. From: 5B2489 Testimony HAWAII SOCIETY OF NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS 1481 S. King Street, Suite 501 Honolulu, Hawaii 96814 Dr. Kevin Gibson Legislative Committee Member TESTIMONY BEFORE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE The Honorable David Y. Ige, Chair The Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair SB2489, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine For a hearing scheduled Wednesday February 3, 2010 at 3:00 PM, Conference Room 016. February 3, 2010 Chair Ige, Vice Chair Green and Members ofthe Committee: My name is Sarah Strong and I am a licensed naturopathic physician in the Hawaii and the Vice President of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians. I am personally writing in strong OPPOSITION of SB2489. I urge you to read this testimony in detail in order to gain a better understanding of exactly what naturopathic medicine is and what part it plays in the health care of Hawaii. Last year the legislature passed SB420 SD2, HD2 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine which was subsequently vetoed by Governor Linda Lingle and then overridden during special session by the Senate with a vote of25 ayes to 0 noes with one reservation and by the House with 45 ayes to 2 noes, with 4 excused to create Act 22 on 7-15-2009. Act 22 amends chapter 455 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS 455) to modernize the naturopathic medicines scope of practice to include parenteral 1 therapy, minor office procedures and for the Board of Naturopathic Medicine to develop a prescription formulary. SB2489 seeks to eliminate this modernization ofHRS 455. A more detailed explanation of naturopathic medicine and the specific modernization aspects of HRS 455 are presented below. A Brief Description of Naturopathic Medicine: Naturopathic medicine bridges the gap between natural and conventional medicine. It is a distinct and comprehensive form of medicine that blends centuries-old, natural, non-toxic therapies with current advances in the study of health and human systems. Naturopathic medicine covers all aspects of family health from prenatal to geriatric care, with a special focus on whole-patient wellness. Philosophy and Treatment Methods Naturopathic physicians (ND) are trained as integrative doctors, emphasizing the use of natural therapies in the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic illnesses. Naturopathic practice is predicated upon the assumption that the human body is inherently capable of healing itself. In practice, NDs perform physical examinations, take thorough health histories, make nutritional and dietary assessments, and order lab tests. NDs may also order diagnostic tests and imaging procedures such as x-rays, ultrasounds, and anything else a general practitioner would require to access health and determine appropriate treatment methods for a patient. Referrals are made to specialists or other healthcare providers for additional testing or treatment when necessary. Education Naturopathic physicians attend four-year; graduate level, in-residency programs at institutions recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. There are currently four such schools in the United States. Naturopathic medical schools provide the same foundational coursework as conventional medical schools. In fact, ND programs often provide more pharmacology and physiology than mainstream MD schools do. In addition, ND programs provide extensive education unique to their treatment approach, emphasizing disease prevention and wellness While this list is by no means comprehensive, naturopathic physicians are trained in the following: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, pharmacology, parenteral/intravenous therapies, homeopathic medicine, physical medicine, lifestyle counseling and stress management, natural childbirth, minor office procedures and monitoring nutrientldruglherb interactions. In fact, NDs are the only healthcare professionals formally trained to monitor and manage nutrientldruglherb interactions. The Board of Naturopathic Medicine's formulary adoption: The formulary adopted by the Board of Naturopathic Medicine on 1/1/1 0 reflects one adopted by the California Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine in 2007. That formulary was developed over a two ,year period by a panel of two naturopathic doctors, two allopathic/medical doctors and two pharmacists. Similar and broader formularies were adopted many years ago in other western states, such as Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Utah and Montana. It is a formulary that reflects the fact that naturopathic doctors provide primary care, and need to have access to medications which are commonly used in such care. The Hawaii naturopathic formulary does not include any controlled substances, or any medications which are generally prescribed by specialists, such as oncologists, neurologists, and cardiologists. In preparation for the California Bureau's report, the Bureau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allow NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing. The California Bureau also contacted NCMIC Insurance Company. NCMIC insures NDs in all of the licensing states and also insures the naturopathic medical schools. In a letter to the Bureau dated June 7,2006, NCMIC stated: \"In the five years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Physicians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications. \" 2 Additionally, the Bureau contacted Jury Verdicts Northwest (JVN) to see if there were any civil actions filed against a licensed ND. JVN covers both Oregon and Washington, the two states with the greatest number ofNDs and that have been licensing NDs for a considerable length of time (since 1919 and 1927, respectively). JVN responded \"Upon reviewing cases contained in Jury Verdicts Northwest's database we found no cases against naturopaths for prescription negligence, or for that matter our database contained no cases against naturopaths at all.\" Naturopathic Medical School Pharmacological Education Interventions by naturopathic physicians include the use of pharmaceuticals when appropriate. Naturopathic medical students are required to learn about all classes of pharmaceutical agents, regardless of their ability to prescribe them under various state laws. A typical program includes 72 hours of classroom education which includes the principles of pharmacodynamics, side effects, and therapeutic uses of legend, or prescription, drugs. This does not include many other hours in courses such as gynecology, urology, cardiology, dermatology, etc. where prescription medications are discussed. It also does not include the minimum 1200 hours of clinical training where prescription medications are prescribed, administered, and managed as part of comprehensive treatment plans. This compares favorably with the didactic education for other medical professionals with legend drug prescribing rights. Pharmacology is also an integral part of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX). NPLEX consists of extensive clinical case summaries for which the candidate must answer a series of questions relevant to diagnosis and treatment for each case. Naturopathic students are exposed routinely in their clinical training to the appropriate selection, prescription, and management of prescriptive drug use, with clinical rotations providing practical management experience. They are also exposed to a wide variety of patient populations, and while it is true that many patients select naturopathic care based on their desire to avoid or reduce use of legend drugs with perceived side effects, a drug may be the best choice for their care at certain times. Naturopathic physicians are trained to recognize the indications, efficacy and potential side effects of all drugs a patient is on whether they can prescribe them or not, since many patients come in already taking medications. In all teaching clinics, assessment ofthe patient history includes an evaluation of their current pharmacological treatments. Parenteral therapies: Naturopathic doctors licensed here in Hawaii and nationwide have been administering natural substances including vitamins, minerals and amino acids subcutaneously, intramuscularly and intravenously (i.e., parenterally) for over twenty years. The naturopathic governing statute, HRS 455 prior to 2009 stated naturopathic doctors may use the\" .natural methods or modalities, together with natural or homeopathic medicines, natural foods, and herbs, and nature's remedies of the type taught in education and training at naturopathic medical colleges.\" Because injection routes are taught in naturopathic medical colleges, doctors had chosen in the past to safely utilize these effective methods. The naturopathic governing board issued an opinion in 1984 that the injection of vitamins was within the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians. There has not been one case of misuse or harm caused by these methods reported to the state licensing board or the state member society. In addition, naturopathic malpractice insurance companies insure practitioners using these techniques. The largest insurance companies offering malpractice insurance have not received one malpractice claim throughout the nation against a naturopathic physician for the misuse of injection methods. There were no complaints brought to the Board of Naturopathic Examiners in regard to the use of these injectable natural medicines by naturopathic physicians during this time. In 2006, the legislature approved HBll55 which clarified that naturopathic physicians have the authority to administer natural medicines by injection, although the bill was vetoed by the Governor. Vitamin, mineral, and amino acid injections are very beneficial for a variety of health conditions, including immune enhancement, correcting nutrient deficiencies, and eliminating toxic substances such 3 as heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc.). Naturopathic physicians provide a valuable service to public health and safety by offering this treatment. Opposition of SB2489 would allow naturopathic physicians to continue to practice primary care medicine as they are trained to. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

I was born and raised in Oahu, so it was very important to me to return here back to the islands with a professional degree that I felt was in need here in the islands. What I learned from being in school and away from the islands for 4 years was a very valuable training to help my family as well as friends here in the islands. I would like my practice to fully encompass all of the training I received while I was away. I actually do have some local friends in school who did not come back to the islands because of the limitations and lack of modernization within our law. 5B2489 takes away from my training and practice privileges that I have obtained and practiced in Oregon while I was in school. Please oppose 5B2489. Mahalo for the opportunity to testify. Dr. Monique Yuen 3 S82489 Terry Shintani February 2,2010 TO: The Honorable David Y. Ige, Chair, the Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Health RE: PLEASE SUPPORT 582489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine (Hearing scheduled for Wednesday, February 3, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. in Conference Room 016) Dear David Ige, Chair, Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee, As associate chair to the Department of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, I am writing to strongly urge your support for S82489 relating to naturopathic medicine. This bill would protect the people of Hawaii from unrestricted prescriptive authority by naturopaths. The Formulary should be constructed by a multidisciplinary group of professionals as all of the formularies in the State. The Naturopaths from the only 4 accredited schools in the US do not provide an appropriate sample of those with expertise to address this critical issue http://www.cnme.org/mc.org/ . You should also be aware this bill was NOT introduced by HMA as stated by Dr. Steelsmith. She has a significant problem using correct information. For example, she states \"Hawaii's naturopathic physicians are more than adequately trained to practice under our existing law. They have extensive training at nationally accredited naturopathic medical schools, and they are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians who diagnose and treat disease.\" These are few accredited schools of Naturopathy. This link to one of their accrediting agencies that has recently come under review for inadequacies is provided. http://www.cnme.org/ The other agency is quoted below. \"They receive standard medical school training in the sciences -the same basic sciences taught in conventional medical schools, including conventional methods of physical, clinical, and laboratory diagnosis.\" We now have the most liberal law in the country. Must someone die here before you folks understand what you have done? Last year's modernization of Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law allows our naturopathic physicians to practice according as a primary care physician. Dr Steelsmith states \"For many years naturopathic physicians in other states have had the right to prescribe medications, do minor surgery, and do injections (both intramuscular and intravenous) ... she forgets to mention they are not licensed in these States. You should also be aware there are NO continuing education requirement for this group of providers. Both nurses with prescriptive authority and MO's have such requirements to maintain their license. Lack of support for SB2489 would have many negative consequences on the quality of care for the people of Hawaii, diminishing the overall quality of healthcare in our state. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing of your support for SB2489. I support complementary and alternative medicine. Sincerely yours, Terry Shintani, MO, JO, MPH Associate Chair Complementary and Alternative Medicine ACCREDITATION WHAT IS ACCREDITATION Accreditation for Naturopathic programs in the United States is an entirely \"voluntary\" process. Accreditation for an institution of learning represents a \"validation\" that the school programs have been thoroughly investigated and found worthy of recognition. This investigation is conducted by a qualified group of people familiar with the programs offered. Students and institutions of learning have come to rely on decisions from ANMAB as a reliable source for determining quality in education. TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL EDUCATION There are two main types of schooling accredited by ANMAB available to the prospective stndent. 1. Traditional schools include those learning institutions requiring one to be present in a classroom setting at some point in the learning process. Supporters believe the structural interaction between students encourage a better learning experience. 2. Non-Traditional schools include those learning institutions that offer courses or programs by mail, often called correspondence, or distant learning programs. Supporters of Non-traditional schools point to convenience in busy schedules, and financial advantages in taking such programs. These graduates also believe it takes a more dedicated, determined student to complete such programs. Both programs have their advantages, and disadvantages. Recently both have offered programs \"online\". Online programs have solved certain credibility issues for those earning degree's outside ofthe resident programs. Frequently Asked Questions Can I get Certified after completing a program at an ANMAB approved school? Yes! The American Naturopathic Medical Certification Board (ANMCB) offers certification for those individuals who have graduated from ANMAB's members. For a complete list of board certification natural health care categories and more information please visit their website at www.anmcb.org. When a school is accredited what does that mean? Accreditation for Natnropathic programs in the United States is an entirely \"voluntary\" process. Accreditation for an institntion oflearning represents a \"validation\" that the school programs have been throughly investigated and found worthy of recognition. This investigation is conducted by a qualified group of people familiar with the programs offered. The programs are also found to have also met fmancial stability.

Facts to consider: No entrance exam, such as the Medical College Admissions Test is required of applicants to schools of naturopathy. Naturopathic doctors (NOs) are required to complete just 2 years of basic science and 2 years of clinical training (minimum of only 850 clock hours in patient care over a 2-year period). Post-graduate NO training is required in only one state (Utah - 1 year). 1 There are 36 states that do not license NDs. South Carolina and Tennessee expressly prohibit the practice of naturopathy. Florida abolished its naturopath licensing laws in 1959, and in 2004 a legislative committee concluded that an expanded scope might be harmful. Several other states, including Texas and Virginia, have abolished previous naturopathy licensure provisions. Of the 14 states that do license NDs (plus the District of Columbia), most have continuing education requirements, while Hawaii does not. NDs are required to take just 7-11 credits of pharmacology. While 11 other states allow some sort of prescriptive authority for NDs, most are much more limited than in Hawaii and many require some type of physician involvement, whether at the board level or at the individual practitioner level. Only Oregon comes close to the amount of authority allowed in Hawaii. For'comparison in Hawaii, a joint formulary advisory committee for APRNs requires representation by MDs and/or DOs, while the naturopathic board has no representation at this level of expertise. Additionally, Medicare does not reimburse for naturopathic services, and Hawaii Medicaid, which typically follows Medicare coverage, will not likely add it to the list of covered services. (ND scope of practice cannot adequately address access to care for the Medicare and Medicaid population.) The recent law allowing Naturopaths prescriptive rights, (over the objection of the Hawaii Medical Board) has created a massive problem in that untrained individuals may now, essentially function as Medical Doctors. The best option would be to repeal the 2009 law that made this bill necessary. However, while that should be the ultimate goal of our State Senators, this bill will at least protect Hawaii's people from the danger they are about to face. Sincerely, R.

Ige, Chair Senator Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair From: Joseph M. Zobian, M.D. Re: SB2489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE In Support Chairs and Committee Members: I support SB2489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine. While it is common knowledge that there are too many regions of our state underserved by qualified medical personnel, the current trend oflowering standards to allow the unqualified to function as physicians not only fails to solve the problem but creates some that are far worse. The practice of medicine is highly complex, hence the long years of training and supervision every medical doctor must undergo before being licensed to practice. Even after completion of this rigorous training all licensed physicians are required to continue their medical training to maintain their license. For many years non-medical doctors have sought the legal right to prescribe medications. To some this may seem reasonable, but even the most seemingly harmless medications can produce side-effects and reactions that are potentially life-threatening. Such complications are infrequent but inevitable, and it is only the extensive training of the medical doctor which enables him to avoid or minimize hann to the patient. Naturopathic practitioners are already pennitted to practice their methods on the people of Hawaii. Now some of them are demanding the legal right to prescribe medicines without the benefit of the complete medical training we all know must precede the practice of medicine. Allowing them to prescribe medications is potentially dangerous, particularly for those patients who have not been informed that their 'doctor' never attended medical school, never completed internship and residency, and is not a licensed medical physician. If the legislature deems these risks to be acceptable, then at the very least the types of drugs they are allowed to prescribe (i.e. formulary) must be regulated by qualified medical physicians in order to help mitigate the potential risks to patients. Please support this bill. Better yet, please reserve the practice of medicine to those who have completed the many years of necessary and indispensable training. There are some 'naturopathic doctors' who are also properly trained and licensed medical doctors. This should be the standard we set for those who want to provide medical care to the people of Hawaii. We have sworn to protect them, and this is an opportunity to do so. A ~_ ofHea1th Senator David Y. Ige, Chair Senator Josh Green, MD., Vice Chair Fro~ Calvin C. M. Kam, M.D. \u00b7JnSupport Chairs and Committee Members: PAGE 01 I support SB 2489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine because this will prevent inevitable health care problems t1;Iat will occur when unnatural activities are allowed. Naturopathic medicine, as defined in Se\u00abtion 455-1, supports and stimulates the natural body processes. That should not include minor office procedures and pl\\Ienterallhetapy. Their Board was to establish education, training, and administration standards by the end of2009. What was done? Was a Naturopathic formulary established 1hat will be approved annually (by whom)? . One major problem presently is the high cost of medications with concern whether these arerea1ly necessary. There are excessive high cost products with ads lhat encourage patients to ask doctors to prescribe them. I personally would not order these and defer to specialists to do so. Thank: you for considering this important bill. M.D. TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE To: Senator David Y. Ige, Chair Senator Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Health From: Re: S82489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE I support SB2489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine In allopathic medical school, after first two year of basic medical science, students spend 3rd and 4th year training thinking about drug based solution for medical problem s and learning basic invasive procedures. For those who go into primary care setting they will be rollowed by 3 years of residency in ramily medicine or internal medicine or pediatrics. where they refine their skill of giving drugs and invasive procedures (minor surgeries, IV, intubation .... etc). In Naturopathic School (do not have the same admission requirements and National Medical Board Examination as MO School) NOs spend over two years thinking about 'natural treatment' for medical problems. Although they took the pharmacology classes this does not include emphasis and practice with drugs. Their curriculum emphasize nutrition, vitamins, supplements and herbs. In ND School students also spend time studying acupuncture and Chinese medicine which is a 3 -4 years full time curriculum in Acupuncture School. In that regard ND students spend even less time than allopathic medical student in drugs and procedures training within the same 4 years of post-graduate schooling. Residency is not required for ND nor are there sufficient residencies for graduating NO students. Many States do not license NOs as can be seen from NO Association website where they are talking about legislative agendas. The problem with the law 420 is that it is an expansion of the NO scope of practice including prescribe drugs and do procedures which they do not have the equivalen t training and regulatory mechanism like MD have. They do not have rigorous training to handle high risk situation and emergency cases or any situation that require giving drugs because they focus on natural healing. Classroom pharmacology and procedure s without adequate residency training, supervision and experience will not prepare them to handle serious medical situation for example. pneumonia , or serious systemic illness etc .. I support Naturopathic philosophy and practice because I promote those skills but how to use drugs and medical procedures. allopathic medicine is what I count on and not from the other alternative disciplines. Let's get real. if it is true that Naturopat hs have received the same training as MO in their 4 years post\u00b7graduate schooling and just as good as MOs in allopathic medicine as they told the public then where are those lime required for studying nutrition. vitamin and supplement s, traditional Chinese medicinc. acupuncture, western and Chinese herbology. in the same 4 years of schooling? Chinese medicine is a 4 year program. Something has to cut short here if Naturopaths cramp all those knowledge in 4 years. I hope it will not be in expensc of our patient's safelY. Because NDs are trained differently at this point of time they should not be used as substitute for the shortage of MD in Hawaii. This will decrease the quality care of medicine in Ilawaii. We should try to keep MOs in the Hawaii and recruit more MDs rrom US Mainland in order to solve MO shortage problem. 1 Other facts to support 592489: There are 36 states that do not license NOs. South Carolina and Tennessee expressly prohibit the practice of naturopathy .

I would like to ask the the Chair of the respective Committees to defer this bill, to hold it in Committee for certain amendments, re-writing and re-consideration. As you all know, last session, SB420 became Act 22 making \"New Law\" after a landslide veto override. Only two Republicans voted with the governor's agenda; she had vetoed similar legislation twice. Unfortunately, The Lingle Administration has tied up implementation of this New Law in the rule making process. As of January 1, 2010, the Lingle Administration has cut off parenteral therapeutics of injection, which was always permitted by Law thereby interrupting ongoing patient care. [Havillg vetoes illjeetioll wriee Before, that may haye Beell the Governor's illtelltiell all aiellg.] This interruption in ongoing patient care is a crisis for those patients affected and an unintended consequence of Act 22. The Legislature is united in rectifying this health care delivery problem. It may require another veto override to overcome the log jam in the Lingle Administration. Cutting off ongoing patient care seems to be essentially a violation of Article IX of the Hawaii State Constitution requiring both \"protection and promotion of the Public Health.\" This bill and others seek to \"gut\" Act 22 which would further expand and intensify this Article IX violation and result in much greater patient crisis. More of a problem. We, the patients, the people of Hawaii, ask you to defer this bill, to hold it in Committee for certain amendments, re-writing and re-consideration in the near future for the purpose of unblocking this administrative log jam in the Lingle administration and to provide for certain housekeeping measures to modernize and correct language in other area of Act 22. Act 22 contains similar language as the Oregon State Law from over 40 years ago. I was trained and educated under the Oregon State Law that Act 22 mimics. This new law to Hawaii is not new to the education and licensing of Naturopathic Physicians. Language in this Law reflects similar language in other State Licensing Laws for Naturopathic Medicine. This Language of Law is in harmony with the accredited professional schools of Naturopathic Medicine and in harmony with the professional valid and reliable examination for the licensing of Naturopathic Physicians. The State board of naturopathic medicine has been conducting itself by Law and in its rules in harmony with this new law. The Board has been contracting with the professional valid and reliable examinations based upon this New Law which is the Old Law everywhere else. Act 22 may seem like a giant step for the State of Hawaii and it was. In one session, the State of Hawaii caught up to similar language of Law that is over 30 years old. In one session, the State of Hawaii took a giant step to make up for a 30 to 50 year lag. Last session, the State of Hawaii, in terms of Well ness and Natural health care, has entered the 21 Century. It is no secret that the State of Hawaii is in a critical health care delivery crisis suffering on one side from a shortage of physicians, nurses and other medical professionals and on the other side with, high rates of degenerative disease, newly emergent diseases, viral pandemics and escalating health care costs Federal Studies undertaken subsequent to the Federal Health Care Reform effort state that 50% of the health care dollar is wasted due to a lack of Well ness. Naturopathic Physicians are the leading medical expert providers in Wellness. Wellness is our Tradition. We envision a new era of health care delivery in Hawaii where the various medical professions work together. We believe that the Department of Health should work to incorporate and work with all licensed medical professionals. Not only in many Natural Disasters but also in sporting events like the Olympics, teams of \"alternative\" providers have served well, proving to be invaluable, in times of need. What used to be Alternative Medicine is not Integrative Medicine. On ever major health care controversy, the Natural Wellness Medicine has been 100% right and the AMAIDrug Company orthodox medical position has been proven wrong. We have brought about an evolution with the AMAIDrug Company orthodox medical practices by integrating Traditional Natural Medicine practices and principles. We have made giant strides in birthing, diet, nutrition, exercise, stop smoking, and other wellness programs. When I first came to Hawaii, diet and exercise was considered Quackery now it's State of the Art. The next three areas will be in Cancer care, Viral diseases and the Autism epidemic. As of a few years ago, 60% of cancer patients report to their MD that they are using natural medicine. 40% of people across the board think that there is a treatment for cancer that the Government is suppressmg. This view is shared by 100% of pharmacists, physicians and drug companies \"in the know\" For example, the new antibody therapies making great improvements in patient care and outcome were developed in the 1930's. That's 70 years ago! The medical researchers and the drug companies knew in 1980 that adequate nutritional levels of Vitamin D3 would cut 50% of all cancers and improve cancer outcome for the rest. This was kept quiet for 30 years while the Drug companies tried to develop a drug analog that they could patient and profit. Natural Medicine has been providing low cost effective therapies for viral diseases for millennia. The Autism epidemic can be reversed and autism prevented with increased public safety laws prohibiting the use of mercury in medicine and dentistry. And above all there needs to be fundamental change in the Department of Health requiring the administration to work harmoniously with all licensed health care providers and NGOs. What the AMA can not undertake on its own due to Federal Anti-Trust Laws, they lobby the Legislature and the Governor offices for anti-competitive trade practices through regulation and licensing. Forty years ago the FTC busted the AMA anti-competitive trade practices directed against the psychologists. The Courts have also overturned anti-competitive trade practices by MD radiologists against Chiropractors. Naturopathic Medicine remains the main target of anti-competitive trade practices by the AMA, its sister organizations, e.g. HMA, physician within the Department of Health and other govemment officials. They carryon these anti-competitive trade practices through the Legislature and the Governor's office. These anti-competitive trade practice cost the State of Hawaii both money and lives. We, the people, the patients of the State of Hawaii, feel that it is time to usher in a new era of cooperation for Health Care Delivery in Hawaii. This new era was begun by the Legislature three decades ago with the integration of health care deliver services in the State Community Hospitals on the Big Island of Hawaii. Last year the Governor in her veto message requested new law to compel supervision of the Naturopathic Board in writing the Naturopathic Formulary by the boards of Pharmacy and Medicine/Osteopathic medicine. This has been proven to be a disaster for Article IX in the area of nursing. New law is not necessary for cooperation and communication amongst the various boards in DCCA all within the Governor's office. New Law is required to forbid anti competitive trade laws and government practices as a work around loop-hole for FTC violations. New Law is required to correct the ongoing anti-competitive Laws within the HRS. We would request that you recommit this bill to committee and amend the language by deleting everything in total and replacing the language of the bill, inserting and numbering as appropriate, with: All persons holding a valid license to practice Naturopathic Medicine in the State of Hawaii as of 12-31-2009 will enjoy grandfathering rights for the practice of parenteral therapy and the parenteral use of medicines as of January 1,2010 and henceforth.

I am requesting that you please vote AGAINST S8 2489 relating to naturopathic medicine. This bill would reduce the quality of healthcare in Hawaii by removing the authority of the board of naturopathic medicine to establish important standards for the naturopathic profession. Only the board of naturopathic medicine has the appropriate awareness of issues specific to the practice of naturopathic medicine to act with authority in this regard. It is the natural duty of the naturopathic board to regulate naturopathic physicians, and it would be inappropriate to allow any other group or entity to do so. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians are more than sufficiently trained to practice under our existing law. They have extensive training at nationally accredited naturopathic medical schools, and are licensed as primary care physicians who diagnose and treat disease. Last year's modernization of Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law has finally allowed our naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training, and according to standards that have long been honored in other states. Last year the citizens of Hawaii resoundingly demanded legislative changes that give them greater access to quality naturopathic care. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians are a valuable part of our healthcare system, uniquely qualified to work with other types of health professionals to provide integrative healthcare. S8 2489 would undermine the value of last year's modernization of our naturopathic law, have dire consequences for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii, and significantly reduce the overall quality of healthcare available in our state. Please vote against S8 2489. Sincerely, Dr. Laurie Steel smith N.D., L.Ac. 1 Dear Sen. Ige, Chair, Sen Green, Vice Chair and Committee Members, I am a Hawaii resident, a physician retired from Kaiser and a concerned citizen. I am writing to strongly urge your opposition to S.B. No. 2489 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic physicians have extensive medical training at naturopathic medical schools. Last year, the Hawaii State naturopathic law was modernized to better reflect their scope of practice. SB 2489 aims to remove these improvements. In my view, this was very appropriate, and represented legislation which served as a model for other states. With the current state of the economy, many physicians are leaving our state. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians, naturopathic physicians are truly an invaluable part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with the current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Restricting naturopathic physicians from being able to practice according to their training will decrease the quality of health care available to the citizens of this state. Naturopathic physicians have a definite role in caring for people. They are quite popular, never practice outside of their guidelines, and serve a function that is not always being served by MD/OD practitioners. Thank you for your consideration. Please Oppose SB 2489. Sincerely yours, Thomas A. Nestor, To: HTHTestimony Subject: S82489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Wednesday, February 3,2010,3:00 p.m., Conference Room 016 To: Senate Committee on Health Senator David Y. Ige, Chair Senator Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair From: Vince Yamashiroya, MD 1010 South King Street, Suite 105 Honolulu, HI 96814 Re: S82489 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE In Support Chairs and Committee Members: I support S82489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine . Facts to consider: (For more resources contact HMA at info@hmaonline.net or 536-7702 ext. 110, or visit www.cnme.org ) No entrance exam, such as the Medical College Admissions Test is required of applicants to schools of naturopathy. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are required to complete just 2 years of basic science and 2 years of clinical training (minimum of only 850 clock hours in patient care over a 2-year period). Post-graduate ND training is required in only one state (Utah - 1 year). There are 36 states that do not license NDs. South Carolina and Tennessee expressly prohibit the practice of naturopathy. Florida abolished its naturopath licensing laws in 1959, and in 2004 a legislative committee concluded that an expanded scope might be harmful. Several other states, including Texas and Virginia, have abolished previous naturopathy licensure provisions. Of the 14 states that do license NDs (plus the District of Columbia), most have continuing education requirements, while Hawaii does not. NDs are required to take just 7-11 credits of pharmacology. While 11 other states allow some sort of prescriptive authority for NDs, most are much more limited than in Hawaii and many require some type of physician involvement, whether at the board level or at the individual practitioner level. Only Oregon comes close to the amount of authority allowed in Hawaii. For comparison in Hawaii, a joint formulary advisory committee for APRNs requires representation by MDs and/or DOs, while the naturopathic board has no representation at this level of expertise. Additionally, Medicare does not reimburse for naturopathic services, and Hawaii Medicaid, which typically follows Medicare coverage, will not likely add it to the list of covered services. (ND scope of practice cannot adequately address access to care for the Medicare and Medicaid population.) Please feel free to forward this message to any of your colleagues and non-physician contacts who may also be interested in supporting this bill to protect patient safety. Thank you.

Christenson, MD, DABA February 2, 2010 TO: The Honorable David Y. Ige, Chair, the Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Health RE: PLEASE SUPPORT 582489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine (Hearing scheduled for Wednesday, February 3,2010 at 3:00 p.m. in Conference Room 016) Dear David Ige, Chair, Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and Members of the Cormnittee, I am writing to strongly urge your support for SB2489 relating to naturopathic medicine. I am a physician and I oppose Naturopathic Doctors being allowed to prescribe medications on SB 2489 because I believe that they lack adequate training to do so safely. The original bill SB 420 was presented basically as a way to change the name of the board of Naturopathy to the board of Naturopathic medicine and to authorize rules and to authorize temporary license to licensed out\u00ad of-state naturopathic physicians in a declared public health emergency. During the legislative process, there was I believe a totally unwarranted expansion of the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians including being able to prescribe any medicine determined to be ok by the board of Naturopathic Medicine. I do not think that the naturopathic physicians on the board of Naturopathic Medicine have the knowledge or training to make these kinds of determinations. I do not think that they should be able to determine what drugs they can prescribe. I think prescribing medicines is the practice of medicine and not the practice of naturopathic medicine. A look at the formulary approved by the Naturopathic Board and in effect from Jan 1, 2010 is frightening in its scope and possible danger to patients. It includes but is not limited to: for example: all Hormones, Antibiotics, Anti-tuberculosis agents, Anti-malarial agents, Anti-viral agents, Oral and topical steroids, Anti-coagulant agents, Anti-hypertensive agents, Anti-depressants, all Anti-diabetic agents and Medical Gas. The list is frightful because of the breadth of often very complex medical problems that are being treated by people with less practical drug knowledge than a fourth year allopathic medical student and certainly less than any doctor who has done a residency in primary care. I believe the legislature accepted as fact that naturopathic medical education is substantially equivalent to allopathic medical education in the knowledge of drug -this is simply not true. Allopathic medical students spend their last two years doing diagnosis of disease and drug therapy while naturopathic medical student spent their time doing naturopathic therapy which do not include leaming drug 1 prescription. Even if the first two years is equivalent (a fact not in evidence) the last two years emphasize different path. Many of these drugs on the formulary are very potent and in no way benign. The risks and side effect are substantial and required years of supervision and experience which Naturopathic school and training did not adequately provide. The potential for misuse ofthese drugs is enormous, with real risk to the public health such as development of drug resistant to microbes including TB or AIDS, just to name a few. If naturopathic physicians prescribe drugs, the safety goes down and the cost of medical care in Hawaii will increase.

Y, Ige, Chair, Josh Green MD, vice Chair, and Members of the Senate Committee on Health: I am a physician practicing primary care n Honolulu, writing to strongly urge your support for S82489 relating to naturopathic medicine. This bill would protect the people of Hawaii from unrestricted prescriptive authority by naturopaths. As several of my colleagues have already explained, the training of the naturopathic providers is insufficient for the task of prescribing pharmaceutical agents. In addition, since naturopathic providers do not have the crucial practical experience gained in several years of rigorous training \"in the field\", they are not prepared, and do not qualify for the responsibility of prescribing pharmaceutical agents, as well as performing minor surgical procedures. Allowing them to perform these services without the necessary training and experience will expose our community to an unacceptable risk. I fully support including the naturopathic providers in the primary care network utilizing their knowledge of natural supplements, and dietary measures, and invite you to explore how using their knowledge in these fields can contribute to the health of our community. I believe that in order to best serve our community, both MDs and NDs should do what they do best. Thank you for your consideration for support to S82489.

Ige, Chair, the Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Health FR: James C. Rudosky, Informed Hawaii Resident in SUPPORT of 582489 7014 Niumalu Loop, Honolulu, HI February 2, 2010 Dear David Ige, Chair, Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee I am writing to strongly urge your SUPPORT to 582489 relating to naturopathic medicine. This bill would help protect Hawaii residents from the dangers of naturopaths having prescriptive rights for many medications they are untrained and inexperienced to prescribe. It can be easy for a patient to assume that when a practitioner is a \"doctor\" he or she has the knowledge to provide the full range of primary care. However, naturopathic practitioners (who are not medical doctors but allowed to be called doctors in Hawaii) lack the training to dispense prescriptive medications. In addition, members of the board of naturopathic medicine, as it is now constituted with naturopaths and public members who support naturopathic medicine, lacks the objectivity, training and experience to have authority to decide the formulary for naturopathic practitioners. Naturopaths should NOT be given the ability to prescribe the wide range of drugs which has been suggested, to include hormones; antibiotics; pain control agents; (including antidepressants); endocrine and metabolic agents. Treating the conditions indicated by the use of these medications is beyond the training of naturopaths. I have seen a trend where naturopaths are trying to blur the distinction between themselves and medical doctors. While this goal may be beneficial for naturopaths, it provides no benefit to Hawaii residents. At best, it will put a patient in the hands of a practitioner who is untrained to treat the patient's condition and at worst will cause the patient harm by wasting time that could be spent on truly beneficial treatments. One of Hawaii's most public naturopaths told me that one of her naturopathic colleagues recommended a regimen of nutritional supplements to treat a state III prostate cancer patient of hers. As she spoke, she shook her head in disgust that something so wrong would be recommended. She ended her story by saying that she wouldn't bother to report it to the board of naturopathic medicine because she knew they wouldn't take action. I have had personal experience with a naturopathic practitioner who purported that his special diet could cure hundreds of maladies, from Parkinson's disease to yeast infections. It's really quite preposterous. Having a group of medical practitioners in the state that use the title \"doctor\" yet lack the training of a medical doctor and are not adequately supervised creates opportunities for great harm to patients. Providing naturopaths with prescriptive capabilities, especially for such a wide range of drugs and through the board of naturopathic medicine has the potential to be dangerous to patients. 1 While naturopaths may have training at nationally accredited naturopathic schools, and are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians this doesn't mean that they are competent to have prescriptive responsibilities, especially without guidance from medical professionals who have the appropriate training and experience. It is worth noting that naturopaths are required to complete just 2 years of basic science and 2 years of clinical training. I respectfully ask that the Senate Committee on Health consider that there are 36 states that do not license naturopaths. South Carolina and Tennessee expressly prohibit the practice of naturopathy. Florida abolished its naturopath licensing laws in 1959. Several other states, including Texas and Virginia, have abolished .naturopathy licensure provisions. Of the 14 states that do license naturopaths (plus the District of Columbia), most have continuing education requirements, while Hawaii does not. Finally, naturopaths are required to take just 7-11 credits of pharmacology. While naturopaths like to say that providing them with prescriptive authority will improve primary care in Hawaii, the fact is that there is not a shortage of primary care physicians in Hawaii, but rather a shortage of some specialists. In addition, since Medicare, Medicaid, HMSA, HMAA, Kaiser and other health plans do not cover naturopathic care, few patients would seek primary care through a naturopath, and would be even less likely to want a naturopath to treat the complicated chronic conditions which would be indicated by the drugs mentioned above. Truthfully, naturopaths are trained in vitamin therapies, not the full range of modalities taught to medical doctors. I ask the committee to please protect Hawaii consumers and patients from the growing perception that naturopaths are medical doctors. Extending prescriptive rights and doing so through the board of naturopathic medicine would be a great disservice to the public for the benefit of a handful of naturopathic practitioners. One local naturopath has written that, \"naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. As the most highly trained of healthcare practitioners in preventive medicine, they are uniquely qualified to collaborate with other healthcare professionals in providing truly complimentary and integrative healthcare.\" The only way naturopaths can be a complement to Hawaii's health care system is under the supervision of trained medical doctors, not a naturopathic board made up of naturopaths and a few sympathetic lay people. I am in SUPPORT of 582489 which would prevent the board of naturopathic medicine from having formulary responsibilities for naturopaths and I am also opposed to naturopaths having prescriptive rights. Improperly prescribed, these medications can cause harm, perhaps even deaths, among Hawaii's trusting patient population.

I am requesting that you please vote AGAINST S8 2489 relating to naturopathic medicine. This bill would reduce the quality of healthcare in Hawaii by removing the authority of the board of naturopathic medicine to establish important standards for the naturopathic profession. Only the board of naturopathic medicine has the appropriate awareness of issues specific to the practice of naturopathic medicine to act with authority in this regard. It is the natural duty of the naturopathic board to regulate naturopathic physicians, and it would be inappropriate to allow any other group or entity to do so. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians are more than sufficiently trained to practice under our existing law. They have extensive training at nationally accredited naturopathic medical schools, and are licensed as primary care physiCians who _ diagnose and treat disease. Last year's modernization of Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law has finally allowed our naturopathic phYSicians to practice according to their training, and according to standards that have long been honored in other states. . Last year the citizens of Hawaii resoundingly demanded legislative changes that 1 give them greater access to quality naturopathic care. Hawaii's naturopathic physiCians are a valuable part of our healthcare system, uniquely qualified to work with other types of health professionals to provide integrative healthcare. SB 2489 would undermine the value of last year's modernization of our naturopathic law, have dire consequences for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii, and significantly reduce the overall quality of healthcare available in our state. Please vote against SB 2489. Sincerely, Dr. Elizabeth Elliott N.D., L.Ac. 2 Darrow M. Hand, N.D. 1413 Ward Avenue - B Honolulu, HI 96822 February 2,2010 TESTIMONY BEFORE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE RE: OPPOSITION TO SB2489, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine scheduled for Wednesday, February 3,2010 at 3:00 PM, Conference Room 016. Dear Honorable David Y. Ige, Chair, Honorable Josh Green, M.D, Vice Chair and other distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Health, I am Dr. Darrow Hand, a licensed naturopathic physician in the State of Hawai'i, and I am writing to strongly urge your OPPOSITION of SB2489 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. Last year the legislature heeded the overwhelming support of the citizens of Hawai'i to pass SB420 SD2, HD2 to modernize the naturopathic medicine law such that our scope of practice was more in line with our training. SB2489 seeks to eliminate this modernization. Naturopathic physicians attend four-year, graduate level programs at institutions recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Naturopathic medical schools provide the same foundational coursework as conventional medical schools. In addition, naturopathic programs provide extensive education unique to our treatment approach, emphasizing disease prevention and wellness. Some of our coursework includes: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, pharmacology, parenteral therapies, physical medicine, lifestyle counseling and stress management, natural childbirth, minor office procedures and monitoring nutrient/drug/herb interactions. The Board of Naturopathic Medicine in Hawai'i adopted a formulary on January 1, 2010. Prior to this, similar and broader formularies were adopted in other western states, such as Washington, Oregon, Arizona, California, Utah and Montana. Naturopathic doctors provide primary care and need to have access to medications commonly used in such care. The Hawai'i naturopathic formulary does not include any controlled substances. While it is true that many patients select naturopathic care based on their desire to avoid or reduce use of legend drugs, a drug may be the best choice for their care at certain times. Naturopathic physicians are trained to recognize the indications, efficacy and potential side effects of all drugs a patient is on. Naturopathic doctors have been administering natural substances including vitamins, minerals and amino acids subcutaneously, intramuscularly and intravenously for years. Injections of natural substances are beneficial for immune enhancement, correcting nutrient deficiencies, eliminating toxic substances such as heavy metals (eg, mercury) and more. Naturopathic physicians provide a valuable service to public health and safety by offering this treatment. The scope of practice for Naturopathic Medicne was expanded last year to include parenteral therapy, minor office procedures and for the Board of Naturopathic Medicine to develop a prescription formulary. Opposition of 582489 would allow naturopathic physicians to continue to practice primary care medicine as we are trained to. Please Oppose SB2489. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

February 2, 2010 Honorable Chair Ige, Vice Chair Green and Members of the Committee: I am Dr.Steven Dubey, licensed naturopathic physician and acupuncturist, rpracticing on Kauai. I have served on the Naturopathic Board of Examiners, and I am a member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians (HSNP). I have maintained a busy Naturopathic Medical practice since 1981 in Lihue. I work integratively with numerous health practitioners on the island, both giving and receiving patient referrals. Many of my medical colleagues refer me their \"difficult cases\", when treatments with drugs and surgery do no reach a desired outcome. Many of my patients come to me for a complementary approach, to augment or enhance their health, with a variety of complaints .. Many patients refer to me as their primary care provider, preferring natural medicines as their primary care. THE MODERN NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR OF 2010 IS A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. I appeal to you on behalf of the people of Hawaii, and to your common sense for OPPOSITION of SB2489. Last year the legislature passed SB420 SD2, HD2 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine which was subsequently vetoed by Governor Linda Lingle and then overridden during special session by the Senate with a vote of25 ayes to 0 noes with one reservation, and by the House with 45 ayes to 2 noes, with 4 excused to create Act 22 on 7-15-2009. Act 22 amends chapter 455 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS 455) to modernize the naturopathic medicines scope of practice to include parenteral therapy, minor office procedures and for the Board of Naturopathic Medicine to develop a prescription formulary. 1 Miles Greenberg, NO 3093 Akahi Street Lihue, HI 96766 808-245-2277 January 31, 2010 Hawaii State Senate The Twenty-fifth Legislature Regular Session 2010 RE: SB2489 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine To: Chairman David Y.

Naturopathic physicians and their supporters worked diligently to override the Governor's veto ofthe Modernization Bill for Naturopathic physicians (referred to Act 22). I am in opposition ofthis bill. Apparently, the Hawaii Medical Association did not counter our lawmakers last session about the amendments that were added to 455, HRS. Their testimony was painfully antiquated and the only dissenting opinion. Now, they want to strip our parenteral routes of administration, minor procedures and prescriptive priveleges as well as the powers and authority of the Board of Naturopathic Medicine. How can this be?

Ige, Chair The Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair SB 2489, Relating to Naturopathic Medicine For a hearing scheduled Wednesday February 3,2010 at 3:00 PM, Conference Room 016. February 1,2010 Chair Ige, Vice Chair Green and Members of the Committee: I am Dr. Karen Tan, licensed naturopathic physician and acupuncturist and have been in private practice in Honolulu since 1995. I am testifying in OPPOSITION to SB 2489. Last year the legislature passed SB420 SD2, HD2 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine which was subsequently vetoed by Governor Linda Lingle and then overridden during special session by the Senate with a vote of 25 ayes to 0 noes with one reservation and by the House with 45 ayes to 2 noes, with 4 excused to create Act 22 on 7-15-2009. Act 22 amends chapter 455 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS 455) to modernize the naturopathic medicines scope of practice to include parenteral therapy, minor office procedures and for the Board of Naturopathic Medicine to develop a prescription formulary. SB 2489 seeks to eliminate this modernization ofHRS 455. A more detailed explanation of the specific modernization aspects ofHRS 455 are presented below. The Board of Naturopathic Medicine's formulary adoption: The formulary adopted by the Board of Naturopathic Medicine on 111110 reflects one adopted by the California Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine in 2007. That formulary was developed over.a two year period by a panel of two naturopathic doctors, two allopathic/medical doctors and two pharmacists. Similar and broader formularies were adopted many years ago in other western states, such as Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Utah and Montana. It is a formulary that reflects the fact that naturopathic doctors provide primary care, and need to have access to medications, which are commonly used in such care. The Hawaii naturopathic formulary does not include any controlled substances, or any medications, which are generally prescribed by specialists, such as oncologists, neurologists, and cardiologists. In preparation for the California Bureau's report, the Bureau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allow NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing. The California Bureau also contacted NCMIC Insurance Company. NCMIC insures NDs in all of the licensing states and also insures the naturopathic medical schools. In a letter to the Bureau dated June 7, 2006, NCMIC stated: \"In the five years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Physicians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications.\" Additionally, the Bureau contacted Jury Verdicts Northwest (JVN) to see ifthere were any civil actions filed against a licensed ND. JVN covers both Oregon and Washington, the two states with the greatest number ofNDs and that have been licensing NDs for a considerable length of time (since 1919 and 1927, respectively). JVN responded \"Upon reviewing cases contained in Jury Verdicts Northwest's database we found no cases against naturopaths for prescription negligence, or for that matter our database contained no cases against naturopaths at all.\"i Naturopathic Medical School Pharmacological Education 1. Naturopathic medical students are required to lean about all classes of pharmaceutical agents, regardless of their ability to prescribe them under various state laws. 2. A typical program includes 72 hours of classroom education with principles of pharmacodynamics, side effects and therapeutic uses of legend or prescription drugs. There are also many additional hours in gynaecology, urology, cardiology, ermatology etc where prescription medications are discussed. A minimum of 1200 hours of clinical training are also part of our training. This compares favorably with the didactic education for other medical professionals with legend drug prescription rights. 3. Pharmacology is also an integral part of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX). NPLEX consists of extensive clinical case summaries for which the candidate must answer a series of questions relevant to diagnosis and treatment for each case. 4. Naturopathic physicians are trained to recognize the indications, efficacy and potential side effects of all drugs a patient is on whether they can prescribe them or not, since many patients come in already taking medications. In all teaching clinics, assessment of the patient history includes an evaluation of their current pharmacological treatments. Parenteral Therapies 1. Naturopathic doctors licensed in Hawaii and nationwide have been administering natural substances including vitamins, minerals and amino acids subcutaneously, intramuscularly and intravenously (ie parenterally) for over 20 years. The naturopathic governing statute, HRS 455 prior to 2009 stated naturopathic doctors may use the\" ... natural methods or modalities, together with natural or homeopathic medicines, natural foods, and herbs, and nature's remedies of the type taught in education and training at naturopathic medical colleges.\" Because injection routes are taught in naturopathic medical colleges, doctors had chosen in the past to safely utilize these effective methods. 2. In 1984, the Board governing naturopathic physicians issued an opinion that the injection of vitamins was within our scope of practice. There has not been one case of misuse or harm caused by these methods reported to the state licensing board or the state member society. In addition, naturopathic malpractice insurance companies insure practitioners using these techniques. The largest insurance companies offering malpractice insurance have not received one malpractice claim throughout the nation against a naturopathic physician for the misuse of injection methods. 3. There were no complaints brought to the Board of Naturopathic Examiners in regard to the use of these injectable natural medicines by naturopathic physicians during this time. In 2006, the legislature approved HBl155 which clarified that naturopathic physicians have the authority to administer natural medicines by injection, although the bill was vetoed by the Governor. Vitamin, mineral, and amino acid injections are very beneficial for a variety of health conditions, including immune enhancement, correcting nutrient deficiencies, and eliminating toxic substances such as heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc.). Naturopathic physicians provide a valuable service to public health and safety by offering this treatment. Opposition to SB2489 would allow naturopathic physicians to continue to practice primary care medicine as they are trained to. Sincerely Karen Tan, ND., MAcOM, LAc.

I graduated from medical school in 2000 and moved to Kauai to join a naturopathic clinic. I have always wanted to practice to the full extent of my education in order to best help those in need of a full scope of naturopathic modalities. The passage of a more inclusive medical bill for naturopathic primary care physicians in 2009 was a huge step in the direction towards being able to offer patients what they need and deserve from naturopathic medicine. Over the years, I have seen many patients whom were visitors to Kauai and they have often been surprised and disappointed that as a naturopath, I was unable to offer certain modalities they were used to receiving from their naturopaths at home. I strongly oppose S.B. 2489 as it pertains to naturopathic medicine. Passing this bill will decrease the quality of care the citizens of this state deserve.

I serve as Chairman of the Board of Naturopathic Medicine., but I am in Toronto teaching this week at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine and unable to attend this hearing in person and to testify on behalf of the Board. Therefore, I am submitting this testimony in opposition to SB2489, not on behalf of the Board, but as a member of the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians. After passage last year of Act 22, naturopathic medicine was brought into the modern age in Hawaii, after 20 years of lagging behind the scope as taught in naturopathic medical schools and as practiced in many other Western states, including Oregon, Washington, Arizona, and Utah. There is a very good safety record of naturopathic medicine. Act 22 has only been in effect for a few months. The naturopathic profession in Hawaii deserves a chance to show that it can safely and responsibly practice with a broader scope. The Board of Naturopathic Medicine deserves a chance to show that it is developing high standards of practice and care with which it can hold licensees accountable. SB2489 is an ill-timed, regressive piece of legislation which would deprive Hawaiians of their access to urgently needed primary care physicians. I urge you to vote nay on 882489. Mahalo.

I am a concerned citizen of Hawaii, and I am writing in STRONG OPPOSITION of sB2489. Last year the legislature passed sB420 sD2, HD2 Relating to Naturopathic Medicine which was subsequently vetoed by Governor Linda Lingle and then overridden during special session by the Senate with a vote of 25 ayes to 0 noes with one reservation and by the House with 45 ayes to 2 noes, with 4 excused to create Act 22 on 7-15-2009. Act 22 amends chapter 455 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRs 455) to modernize the naturopathic medicines scope of practice to include parenteral therapy, minor office procedures and for the Board of Naturopathic Medicine to develop a prescription formulary. sB2489 seeks to eliminate this modernization of HRs 455.

However, I will be horrified and very angry if you let them get away with it. You all studied this issue last year, heard the voice of the people and voted accordingly. I hope you have the integrity and good sense to stand behind that action in the face of this 11 th hour gasping effort by the opposition. I'm sure you have received many other letters with details of how the proposed modifications will pull the rug out from under the board of naturopathic medicine by negating ALL of the most salient provisions approved in the last session so I won't waste your time by reiterating them all. I will just beg you ..... DON'T LET THEM DO THIS! ! There is a place in the general wellness spectrum for MANY approaches to health and healing. Only the patients suffer in this foolish war against a choice that obviously more and more people are making. The news is full of praise and substantive approbation for the benefits of complementary and alternative healthcare and last year you made it possible to advance this cause for the citizens of Hawaii. The people have spoken and all that remains is to empower the naturopathic practitioners with their considerable training to do their healing work and assure that appropriate standards are maintained. These standards must be set and enforced by those who best understand the goals and methods of their healing art .... the dedicated naturopathic physicians themselves! SB2489 will destroy this process and TOT ALLY negate your previous efforts. You did your homework then and responded to the needs of your constituents.

Aren't there laws already in place which prevent one profession from manipulating, suppressing or influencing the practice of another profession? Didn't we have this same scenario when the Hawaii Medical Society attempted to suppress the chiropractic profession? Isn't that why Boards are established in order to regulate their own profession and write the rules and regulations pertaining to such? So the Board of Medicine is trying to manipulate the Board of Naturopathy? Licensing laws were established in this state which stated that Naturopathic Physicians may practice according to the methods and standards that are taught at the licensed schools. According to our Board the licensing laws are not keeping pace with what is being taught in the schools over the last 20 years. Naturopathic Physicians are not asking for any special privileges. They are only asking to be able to practice according to what they are taught in the Naturopathic Colleges. I OPPOSE SB2489 and HB2312.

Ige, Chair, Sen Green, Vice Chair and Committee Members, We the people must have access to progressive health care modalities. Naturopathic Medicine has proven itself to be both cost effective and clinically successful at preventing and treating serious illnesses. ND practitioners and their patients, your constituents, deserve the gains given to the profession in 2009. I urge you to not allow the HMA to take back these critical treatment options as proposed in SB2489. If you do, you will be contributing to the harmful grip they have on our health care system. The current system has been failing for years and we need change. Please, vote with your conscious, not with big business. Please vote NO to SB2489 Mahalo, Thomas I strongly oppose S82489 .... Dear Sen. Ige, Chair, Sen Green, Vice Chair and Committee Members: I am a Hawaii resident -and long time naturopathic patient -writing to strongly urge your opposition to S.B. No. 2489 as it relates to naturopathic medicine. I can personally attest to the effectiveness of naturopathic treatments and believe naturopathic physicians provide invaluable care. I am aware that last year, the Hawai'i State naturopathic law was modernized to better reflect their scope of practice. SB 2489 aims to remove these improvements. Many physicians are leaving our state. As general practitioners who are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians, naturopathic physicians are a vital part of our healthcare system. Other types of doctors are overwhelmed with the current demand, often making it difficult for patients to receive even basic medical care. Restricting naturopathic physicians from being able to practice according to their training will decrease the quality of healthcare available to the citizens of this state. Thank you for your consideration. Please Oppose SB 2489. Sincerely yours, Leslie A. Hayashi 1645 Ala 10:23 PM HTHTestimony S82489 Dear Sen. Ige, Chair, Sen. Green, Vice Chair, and Committee Members, I am writing because I am in opposition to S.B. No. 2489, regarding naturopathic medicine. There are many corruptions in this country, and sadly, Western medicine is a part of that. The connections between large drug companies and some doctors end up forcing diagnoses on patients prematurely. Naturopathic medicine offers an option to a healthier life without prescription drugs being pushed on us. Wouldn't anyone want to take a \"natu ral remedy\" to improve their health, versus a prescription drug that may come along with harsh side effects? Natural doctors check in with their patients physically as well as emotionally. Restricting naturopathic physicians from being able to practice according to their training will decrease the quality of healthcare available to the citizens of this state. Thank you for your consideration. Please oppose SB 2489.

I am aware of how this bill could negatively affect naturopathic medicine and its standards. PLEASE do NOT allow this bill to pass! Naturopathic physicians, like my naturopathic physician, are highly medically trained. Why is HMA bringing this up? Why are our leaders wanting to pass this??? IS CONTROLLING THE MONEY SOURCE HMA's MAIN REASON!!!! I'm very upset. Let the people make their own decisions. Let me make my own decision with my own health and life! I trust and believe that physicians, both under HMA and naturopathic practices, are both trained to treat people the best they possibly can. The citizens of Hawaii have demanded access to quality naturopathic care because our naturopathic physicians are an invaluable part of our healthcare system. As the most highly trained of healthcare practitioners in preventive medicine, they are uniquely qualified to collaborate with other healthcare professionals in providing truly complimentary and integrative healthcare. Please do not limit, suppress, oppress, or bind my choice and my doctors, regular or naturopathic, from treating me! I chose to try treatment from a naturopathic doctor and my health has improved. SB2489 would have many negative consequences on the quality of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii, drastically reducing our naturopathic physicians' (and my naturopathic doctor's) capacity to effectively serve the public (and me), and limiting Hawaii's ability to attract top-quality naturopathic physicians. As a result, it would greatly diminish the overall quality of healthcare in our state. 1 Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing of your opposition to S62489!

Follow up Flagged This letter is to state an OPPOSITION to the sB2489 bill introduced by the Hawaii Medical Association. Naturopathic physicians are now able to practice primary care medicine as trained. I ask that you allow them to practice WITHOUT the restrictions mentioned in sB2489, such as blocking their ability to do parenteral therapy, minor surgery and naturopathic formulary (vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, botanical medicine, homeopathic medicine, hormones, and those legend drugs consistent with naturopathic medical practice). The practice of naturopathic medicine is safe, as is a well-trained naturopathic physician. The introduction of sB2489 can only be monetary in nature, attempting to protect the profits of the companies associated with \"big pharma\" and conventional medicine. I ask that you allow Hawaii residents to have the freedom to choose their primary care provider and allow naturopathic physicians to practice naturopathic medicine freely. Sincerely, Jason Obenchain 45 Huaalani Subject: TESTIMONY 2489 Aloha Sen. Ige, Chair, Sen Green, Vice Chair and Committee Members, IN THIS TIME OF STRAINED HEALTH CARE, PLEASE DO NOT LEGISLATE-AWAY OUR CHOICES! Naturopathic physicians have extensive medical training at naturopathic medical schools --they are not WITCH DOCTORS or QUACKS. If your own experience with naturopathic medicine is LIMITED, that should not dictate how and who I choose as my primary care physician. When you look at the statistics of disease in children and adults, the medical community often identifies PREVENTATIVE healthcare as one ofthe major factors in REVERSING this trend. Naturopath doctors work wholly from this perspective, addressing the WHOLE BODY system, not just pathology.

Ige, Chair, the Honorable Josh Green, M.D., Vice Chair, and other Distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Health: My family and I have believed in the practice of utilizing both western and eastern medical practices to optimize health and wellness. At a time when our economy faces tough times, it is not only important to focus on healing illness, but proper health maintenance and wellness for mind, body and spirit. Focusing on maintaining health can help keep people at work, increase productivity, and therefore help our economy even further. As much as people should be free to choose their religion in America, along those lines are the importance of choosing the type of health care they receive with the benefits afforded any other healthcare received. Beyond that, the proper procedures and practices of naturopathic medicine should be overseen by authorities with a background in this field of medicine.

This bill would reduce the quality of healthcare in Hawaii by removing the authority of the board of naturopathic medicine to establish important standards for the naturopathic profession. Only the board of naturopathic medicine has the appropriate awareness of issues specific to the practice of naturopathic medicine to act with authority in this regard. It is the natural duty of the naturopathic board to regulate naturopathic physicians, and it would be inappropriate to allow any other group or entity to do so. Hawaii's naturopathic physicians are more than sufficiently trained to practice under our existing law. They have extensive training at nationally accredited naturopathic medical schools, and are licensed as primary care physicians who diagnose and treat disease. Last year's modernization of Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law has finally allowed our naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training, and according to standards that have long been honored in other states. Last year the citizens of Hawaii resoundingly demanded legislative changes that give them greater access to quality naturopathic care. Hawaii\u00b7s naturopathic physicians are a valuable part of our healthcare system, uniquely qualified to work with other types of health professionals to provide integrative healthcare. S8 2489 would undermine the value of last year's modernization of our naturopathic law, have dire consequences for the practice of naturopathic medicine in Hawaii, and significantly reduce the overall quality of healthcare available in our state. please vote against S8 2489.

They have extensive training at nationally accredited naturopathic medical schools, and they are licensed in Hawaii as primary care physicians who diagnose and treat disease. They receive standard medical school training in the sciences\u00b7 the same basic sciences taught in conventional medical schools, including conventional methods of physical, clinical, and laboratory diagnosis.

They also study in\u00b7depth a wide range of approaches to disease prevention, completing four years of study that includes clinical nutrition, pharmacology, cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, neurology, and endocrinology. At the same time, they are required to complete 1,200 hours of clinical training in primary care outpatient settings before passing national licensing. exams. Last year's modernization of Hawaii's naturopathic medicine law allows our naturopathic physicians to practice according to their training as primary care physicians\u00b7 and according to standards that have long been upheld in other states.

Using only nutritional supplements, I have never been ill since. (I take sublingual B 12 for pernicious anemia; and rejected Flomax and surgery, preferring the very bothersome symptoms of an enlarged prostate to the risks of either of those options.) Clearly there is need for allopathy and naturopathy. I see the health care crisis in this country as being deeply rooted in the corporate corruption of our government, recently exacerbated by the Supreme Court's decision that allows the huge megaphone of corporate money to overwhelm political debate. Long before that decision, corporate money has made millionaires of many congress people and policy making appointees, resulting in our degraded, poisoned environment, and a Sickening agribusiness and food industry. The documentary Food Inc. factually revolting, should be mandatory viewing for health care workers and legislators. (available wherever DVDs are sold and in libraries) Doctors of Naturopathy study the effects of food and supplements on health for years, while for M.D.s it is a marginal requirement of a few weeks. The medical profession has increasingly come to be seen as a lucrative business, processing assembly lines of patients, each seen for about 10 minutes, and prescribing highly lobbied pills. Our per capita medical costs are far higher than any developed nation's. Our child mortality is also higher, and average longevity lower. (same AARP issue and page) Allopathy's domination of naturopathy is unwarranted. Their formularies are generally superior to corporate brands'. Please scrap this bill.

Ige, Chair, Sen Green, Vice Chair and Committee Members, I am a Hawaii resident in Mililani. I PREFER naturopathic medicine and physicians. My first two children were born at home, delivered by a midwife working under a naturopathic physician. Finally, my former husband said I had to go to the hospital for our third child --to save money --so our medical insurance would cover it. The only reason I have to go to doctors that prescribe phannaceutical drugs and invasive procedures is because my medical insurance doesn't cover naturaopathic physicians. Please Oppose SB 2489. I understand that last year, the Hawai'i State naturopathic law was modernized to better reflect their scope of practice. 58 2489 aims to remove these improvements. Please don't take away those improvements! Sincerely yours, Wynnie Joy Hee 2010 7:46 AM HTHTestimony Opposition to 882489 I am an individual family member ofHMSA paying approximately $800 per month for health care for my family. I subscribe to a prevention program of health care focusing on proper nutrition, exercise and activities that promote good health and mental health such as yoga, relaxation techniques and living a well-balanced drug and alcohol-free lifestyle. My primary means of medical care is through a naturopath who helps me with digestive issues and the onset of perimenopause as well as guidance and treatment for my teen-age daughters for acne and occasional colds and flu. I pay for insurance to cover treatment as needed for flu or any other unforseen medical expenses. I feel my expenses for prevention through my naturopath should be covered as they eliminate the need for present and future medical expenses associated with these same issues and future issues that could arise if I weren't seeking this help. In addition, I have an aging mother that has never paid attention to neither exercise or nutrition who takes countless prescribed medications for diabetes, diverticulitis (which I hope to avoid with diet and exercise) as well as pain killers for pain from intestinal polyps and an ankle that she severely broke 3 years ago. I am certain that she has an addiction to the narcotic painkillers and that they exacerbate the problems with her digestion. I shudder to think of the expense that she is causing the health care system and I know she represents the problem with a system that focuses on treatment rather than prevention as prescribed by a naturopathic approach. I oppose SB2489 and so should you! Sincerely, Katherine Grainger PO Box 235 Hanalei, HI 96714 1 "}
