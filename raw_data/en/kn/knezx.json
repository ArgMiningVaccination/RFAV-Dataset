TCM has shown to improve the quality of life, protect liver function, alleviate clinical symptoms, and slow down the progression of HIV disease. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of TCM in treating AIDS remains unclear. The following study investigates the clinical efficacy, mechanisms and targets of TCM in the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. Methods: A prospective, open-label, 4-years long pilot study, which included 207 HIV-1-infected patients ware conducted at the HIV outpatient clinic of the Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University between January1, 2011, and December 30, 2014. Patients were divided into HAART group, which was treated with tenofovir (TDF)/lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV); and TCM-HAART treatment group treated with a combination of HAART and TCM (which consisted of Astragalus, Licorice, Atractylodes, Yam, Medlar, Codonopsis, Salvia).HIV-specific T cell immune function and T cell subtype changes were detected using Elispot and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Stronger HIV-specific T cell immune function was observed in TCM HAART group compared to HAART group (P<0.01). Naive CD4 T and CD8 T ratio were significantly increased in TCM-HAART group compared to HAART group at 24W and 72W (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In addition, no significant differences in memory CD4 T, memory CD8 T and Treg cells were found between groups. Conclusions: The obtained findings suggest that TCM can improve the immune function of T cells and promote immune reconstitution of the body.
