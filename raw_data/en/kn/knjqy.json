Individuals will be required to show proof of vaccination Compliance with the policy will be required two weeks before faculty, staff and students are expected to be on campus. The policy will allow for medical exemptions consistent with CDC guidance and manufacturer labeling on contraindications and precautions. As with other policies, and, in the case of employees as required by federal and California law, faculty, staff and students will also be eligible to request accommodations based on disability or religious belief, and deferrals are available for those who are pregnant. Those with approved exemptions, accommodations or deferrals may return to their location with the expectation that they will remain masked in all public settings, and comply with the local testing plan. Employees who choose not to be vaccinated, and have no approved exemption, accommodation or deferral, potentially put others' health at risk and may face disciplinary actions.

Vaccine Information Statement (\"VIS\") : An information sheet produced by or including information derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of Public Health, or UC Health or any of its components , explaining in plain language the benefits and risks of a COVId -19 vaccine to vaccine recipients. A VIS generally must be provided to an individual being vac cinated prior to each dose of the vaccine , in a language they understand. For purposes of this policy, a VIS may also include FDA fact sheets for vaccine recipients and caregivers. III. POLICY TEXT This policy supplements, and does not replace, policies or guidelines requiring University Personnel, Trainees, Students, patients, and visitors to observe N on-Pharmaceutical Interventions , as further described in Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies . A. COVID -19 Vaccination Program . As a condition of Phys ical Presence at a Location or in a University Program , all Covered Individuals must Participate in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program by providing proof of Full Vaccination or submitting a request for Exception or Deferral no later than the Implementation Date. This requirement will be subject to implement ation guidelines and any local procedures for enforcement. Alternative remote instructional programming is not expected to be available in most cases and the availability of alternative remote work arrangements will depend on systemwide guidance and any local policies or procedures , as well as the nature of the work to be performed. 1. Access to Vaccination. All Locations that are campuses and medical centers must offer COVID -19 vaccination on- site or maintain a list of nearby and accessible off -site locations offering vaccination to Covered Individuals during working and non- working hours. This provision is not intended to restrict a Covered Individual 's choice of provider, but to maximize their access to the University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 6 of 34 Vaccine. 2. Proof of Vaccination. Covered Individuals must submit proof of their vaccination or of a University -approved Exception or Deferral to their Location Vaccine Authority , by providing : (i) in the case of one who has been Fully Vaccinated, a copy of their CDC vaccination card (or foreign equivalent in the case of Covered Individuals who received their vaccinations abroad); official documentation issued by a State vaccine registry; or an official medical record ; or (ii) in the case of one who has received a n Exception or Deferral , documentation that the Exception or Deferral has been granted. Proof of vaccination may be subject to audit. Request for Exception /Deferral . A Covered Individual seeking an Exception or Deferral must , no later than the Implementation Date, submit their request to the appropriate Responsible Office . While a request is pending, the Covered Individual must , as a condition of Physical Presence, observe Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions defined by the LVA consistent with applicable public health directives and the guidelines in Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies . If an Exception or Deferral is granted, the issuing office must notify the Covered Individual and the LVA of the approval and the associated expiration date, if any . If a request for Exception or Deferral is denied, the Covered Individual will be notified and, thereafter, will be expected to promptly become Fully Vaccinated or denied Physical Presence at the relevant University Location(s) or Program(s). 3. Educat ion. Any Covered Individual who has not provided proof of Full Vaccination by the Implementation Date will receive from the Location Vaccine Authority or designee information concerning: a. The potential health consequences of COVID -19 illness for themselves, family members and other contacts, coworkers, patients , and the community ; b. Occupational exposure to SARS -CoV-2; c. The epidemiology and modes of transmission, diagnosis, and non- vaccine infection control strategies (such as the use of appropriate precautions , personal protective equipment or face coverings , and respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette), in accordan ce with their level of responsibility in preventing COVID -19 infections; d. The potential benefits of CO VID-19 vaccination; and e. The safety profile and risks of any COVID -19 vaccine . The information may be conveyed through any combination of written information statements , verbal communications, or online or in- person training programs, as required by the Location Vaccine Authority . This educational requirement is not an alternative to required Participation in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program as a condition of Physical Presence at a University Location or Program as set forth above. 4. Registr ation Holds . Program implementation and enforcement with respect to Students will be handled consistent with the procedural provisions of the Student University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 7 of 34 Immunization Policy . Students who fail to pro vide proof of vaccination or apply for an Exception or Deferral by the Implementation Date may, therefore, be subject to a registration hold. 5. Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions. All Covered Individuals must participate in Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions de scribed in Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies , as implemented by the relevant University Location or Program . In the event of a COVID -19 outbreak, Covered Individuals and Covered Non- Affiliates who are not Fully Vaccinated may be excluded from the Location or site of the outbreak. 6. Optional Additional Measures. Covered Individuals may wear masks or face coverings even if they are Fully Vaccinated. B. Covered Non -Affiliates . Each University Location and Program will define any requirements for public or other Covered Non-Affiliate Physical Presence (for example, at health facilities, entertainment venues, museums, libraries, workout facilities, or dining halls or food courts), consistent with applicable public health guidance. C. Superseding Public Health Directives. A federal, state, or local public health agency with jurisdiction may impose a COVID -19 vaccination requirement that lawfully supersedes this policy . In the event of a perceived conflict between public health requirements and this Policy, UC Legal should be consulted. D. Tracking and Reporting 1. Vaccination Data. The following information must be recorded and tracked by the Location Vaccine Authority or designee in the Covered Individual's confidential health record , consistent with University privacy and security policies including BFB-IS-3 (Electronic Information Security Policy) : (i) date(s) of administration and vaccine type and manufacturer ; or (ii) documentation of a University -approved Exception or Deferral . 2. Vaccines Administered by the University a. Registries. For all vaccinations administered by the University in its capacity as healthcare provider, appropriate information will be submitted to the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) or such other registries as may be required by applicable public health agencies or University policy. While vaccine recipients ordinarily are permitted to opt out from registry reporting in California, the California Department of Public Health has mandated that all participating vaccinators report each dose of COVID -19 vaccine administered. Accordingly, the typical opt -out option does not apply. b. Adverse Events . Any adverse events associated with COVID -19 vaccine administ ered at a Location and reported to the University must be tracked and logged by the LVA or designee and reported to federal and state public health officials using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) . E. Program Evaluation. Unless UCOP requires more regular reporting, I ndividual Healthcare Locations must , and other Locations may, evaluate Program Participation University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 8 of 34 on an annual and ongoing basis, including evaluation of equity in P rogram implementation; as well as reasons ident ified for non- Participation or untimely Participation and the number and population -level characteristics of Covered Individuals who are not vaccinated. IV. COMPLIANCE / RESPONS IBILITIES A. CDC and FDA generally translate VIS into many languages commonly spoken in California and elsewhere in the United States and post these online. Whenever the University is administering a vaccine in its capacity as healthcare provider , the relevant VIS should be provided to a person receiving vaccine in a language that they understand. In the unlikely event relevant VIS translations are unavailable, they should be accompanied when distributed with a document with taglines such as those approved by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to facilitate language access by all affected Personnel , Trainees , and Student s. Interpreters should also be made available in person, by video, or by phone during vaccine clinics. B. Each campus is responsible for: (i) assuring any necessary updates are made to its local Infectious Diseases/Infection Prevention and Control Programs; (ii) establishing deadlines for COVID -19 Vaccination Program Participation on an annual or ongoing basis, in consultation with epidemiology and infection prevention experts and occupational health representatives as applicable and consistent with any supply limitations ; and ( iii) assurin g implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program at all sites . 1. Implementation includes informing Personnel , Trainees , and Student s of the requirement and deadline for P rogram Participation , dates and L ocations for on- site administration, and that vacc ines will be provided at no cost to them if they wish to receive the vaccine from the University . 2. Each campus should implement strategies for vaccine access, including efforts to ensure vaccination availability during all work shifts and to address vaccine hesitancy, particularly among groups at most significant risk for contracting COVID -19 and suffering severe illness . C. Chancellors , Laboratory Directors, and the Vice President ANR are responsible for implementing this policy. Deans, Department Chairs, unit heads , managers , supervisors , student affairs leaders , and others with responsibility for personnel management will support P rogram implementation and enforcement . Consultation with Academic Senate leaders, especially on the campus, is encouraged with respect to implementation procedures for academic appointees . V. PROCEDURES A systemwide implementation working group will develop implementation guidelines for this policy, which will subsequently be attached to the policy. Each Location may University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 9 of 34 establish local procedures consistent with those guidelines to facilitate implementation of the policy.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUE STIONS 1. What is the relationship between this policy and the previously posted interim policy? This policy replaces the previously posted interim policy in its entirety . 2. The policy both encourages and requires members of the University Community to be vaccinated. Which is it? The policy strongly encourages all members of the University Community to be vaccinated. Only Covered Individuals are required to Participate in the Program by becoming Fully Vaccinated or receiving a University -approved Exception or Deferral . 3. Why is UC allowing exceptions for reasons other than medical exemption ? If California can eliminate personal belief and religious exceptions for K -12 students, why can't UC do the same? The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to individuals who qualify for an Exception to the vaccination requirement based on their disabilit y, as well as to employees who object to vaccination based on their sincerely -held religious belief, practice, or observance. A decision was made to apply the COVID -19 vaccine mandate consistently across all groups of i ndividuals covered by this policy . Vaccination against the virus that causes COVID -19 is a critical step for protecting the health and safety of our communities and ending the pandemic. 4. Is this a one -time mandate or will I be required to get boosters or annual shots? This is a permanent policy. Infectious disease experts anticipate that annual or more frequent boosters will be necessary and receipt of boosters will be required, consistent with product labeling , in the same way that the initial vaccination is required by this policy and subject to the same Exceptions and Deferrals . 5. Am I required to be vaccinated to attend school? Covered Individuals must receive the COVID -19 vaccine as a condition to Physical Presence at Locations and in University Programs , unless they have been granted an Exception or Deferral . 6. Will this requirement apply to union- represented employees? Yes, in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining requirements. 7. How do I apply for an Exception or Deferral ? Individuals covered by this policy who seek an exception (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (during pregnancy) must complete the request form and submit it to their location's Responsible Office. Model forms have been published with this final policy for adaptation or as -is use by each location. Employees should use the forms adopted by their location. Details will be communicated by each UC Location to Covered Individuals. 8. I am pregnant. Will I be eligible for a medical exemption? No, but, unless you work in a University health care facility, you are eligible for a Deferral throughout your pregnancy until the time that you return to in- person work or instruction, as applicable, following pregnancy. You may al so be eligible for a disability University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 11 of 34 accommodation. It is important to understand, however, the additional risks you and your baby will be exposed to if you contract COVID -19 during pregnancy: According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , \"pregnant people and recently pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID- 19 when compared with non- pregnant people. Severe illnes s includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID -19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with pregnant people without COVID -19.\" By contrast, researchers have found that COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy may prote ct babies from COVID -19 infection through the placenta before birth and through breastfeeding afterwards. A recent study performed by UC researchers concluded that risk of very preterm birth, which occurs at less than 32 weeks of gestation, was 60 percent higher for people infected with COVID -19 at s ome point in their pregnancy, while the risk of giving birth at less than 37 weeks (all preterm births) was 40 percent higher in those with infection. For those who also had hypertension, diabetes and/or obesity as well as COVID -19, the risk of preterm bir th rose 160 percent. There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccines, cause female or male fertility problems. Accordingly, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all eligible individuals, i ncluding those who are pregnant or lactating, be vaccinated. The University strongly supports vaccination for all Students, Trainees, Personnel, and patients who do not have contraindications to one of the vaccines. Note : those who work in University healt h facilities or clinics are subject to an order issued in early August by the California Department of Public Health that does not allow for exceptions or deferrals based on pregnancy, and therefore must have their first dose of a one- dose COVID -19 regimen or their second dose of a two- dose COVID -19 regimen by September 30, 2021. 9. I was recentl y diagnosed with COVID -19, and/or I had an antibody test that shows that I have natural immunity. Does this support a Medical Exemption ? You may be eligible for a temporary M edical Exemption (and, therefore, a temporary Exception) , for up to 90 days after your diagnosis and certain treatments . According to the US Food and Drug Administrat ion, however, \"a positive result from an antibody test does not mean you have a specific amount of immunity or protection from SARS -CoV-2 infection ... Currently authorized SARS -CoV-2 antibody tests are not validated to evaluate specific immunity or protecti on from SARS -CoV-2 infection.\" For this reason, individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID -19 or had an antibody test are not permanently exempt from vaccination. 10. I am participating or have participated in a vaccine clinical trial for a vaccine that has not been approved, and so I have not received a CDC card. Am I considered to be in compliance with the policy? The University will accept any FDA - or WHO -authorized University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 12 of 34 vaccine as fulfilling the mandate. If you participated in a trial of a vaccine that has received authorization from either body, and you can show that you did not receive the placebo (that is, your record has been \"unblinded\"), then you will be considered in compliance with the policy. Boosters may later be required as explained above. For Novavax clinical trial participants: If you participated in the trial long enough to receive your CDC Vaccine Card, you may present a copy of that card as proof of your initial compliance with this policy, even though Novavax has not yet received FDA or WHO authorization. Again, boosters may later be required. 11. How will I know if my co -workers or fellow Student s are going unvaccinated? You probably won't know. Because vaccination- related information is private and confidential, t he University will not disclose vaccine status of Covered I ndividual s except on a need- to-know basis ; however third parties and some Locations may distribute badge attachments, stickers, pins, or other indicators that vaccinated individuals may use to show that they have received the vaccine. 12. I teach both seminar and lecture class es, and as a result am typically exposed to many students. Will I be informed if someone in my class is not vaccinated? If not, will all students be required to wear masks? As will be the case in any public setting, you will not be informed of the vaccination status of individual students and should expect that some may not be vaccinated due to pending or granted Exceptions or Deferrals. Guidance on face coverings for individual s who have and have not been Fully Vaccinated is provided in Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies . 13. Will University of California Health specify which authorized or licensed vaccine is preferred? No. Any COVID -19 vaccine authorized or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the World Health Organization will be accepted to satisfy the vaccination requirement. 14. Will Locations provide paid time off for non-exempt employees for the time needed to get vaccinated? Yes. Non-exempt employees and hourly academic appointees may take up to four hours of paid time to obtain each dose of the SARS -CoV-2 (COVID - 19) vaccine. These employees and academic appointees must provide advance notice to their supervisor. If an employee or academic appointee n eeds more time for this purpose before September 30, 2021, the employee or academic appointee may request 2021 Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL) (Reason 3(d)) for the additional time. 15. What if I experience flu -like symptoms as a result of the vaccine that me an I cannot work as scheduled, or attend classes ? Employees should contact their supervisor s or local human resources offices for instruction but as a general matter, accrued sick leave, vacation, and/or PTO may be used to take time off as needed to recov er. Before September 30, 2021, employees may also request EPSL (Reason 3(e)) for that purpose. Students should contact their faculty/instructors regarding minor illnesses or disability services to address any significant issues. 16. If I have applied for or been granted an Exception or Deferral , what Non - Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) will I be required to observe? See Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies , which describes required NPIs . Additional safety measures may be deemed necessary , depending on the circumstances, by local University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 13 of 34 public health, environmental health and safety, occupational health, or infection prevention authorities , including the Location Vaccine Authority . In that case, a person who has received an approved Exception or Deferral (or whose request is pending) will be informed of any additional requirements. 17. Who will pay for the vaccine? Initial supplies have been paid for by the federal government. Vaccines administered by the University to consenting Covered Individuals as part of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program (e.g., during vaccine clinics or at employee health or occupational health offices) are administered free of charge. In addition, all of the University's health plans cover CDC- recommended vaccines administered by an employee's primary care physician or at a local pharmacy. 18. How will enforcement work for failure to participate in the program? Efforts will be made to encourage Participation in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program prior to the Implementation Date. Requi rements related to employee compliance are generally addressed in Appendix F; note that, for health care workers, the August 5, 2021 CDPH order requires that they have their first dose of a one- dose regimen or their second dose of a two- dose regimen for COVID -19 by September 30, 2021, unless they decline the vaccine on one of the limited grounds recognized by the order. See FAQ #23 below for more information. Students who fail to Participate by being Vaccinated or requesting an Exception or Deferral on or before the Implementation Date will be barred from Physical Presence at University Facilities and P rograms, and may experience consequences as a result of non- Participation, up to and including dismissal from educational programs. 19. I am at high risk for severe illness if I contract COVID -19 (e.g., immunocompromised) and even though I have been vaccinated, I know that no vaccine is 100% effective. Do I have to come to work if my co- workers or Student s are not all vaccinated? What accommodations will be made for me? Please contact your local disability services office to discuss your situation and possible accommodations. 20. Will the University accept internationally approved vaccines even if not authorized or approved in the United States Yes, if the vaccine is authorized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has developed a process for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics during public health emergencies. Through that process, a number of vaccines not available in the United States have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). A document summarizing the status of a wide range of international vaccines can be found online on the WHO's website (click on link to status of COVID -19 vaccines in the EUL/PQ evaluation process) . The University will, consistent with CDC and CDPH guidance, accept proof of Full Vaccination with any international vaccine that has been authorized for emergency use by WHO through the EUL process. People who have completed a COVID -19 vaccination series with one of these vaccines do not need additional doses with an FDA-licensed or - authorized COVID -19 vaccine, at least initially (but may be subject to subsequent boos ter requirements). Those who are not Fully Vaccinated generally will be required to receive an FDA -licensed or -authorized Vaccine no less than 28 days after their last international vaccination (but may consult with the LVA or designee to discuss eligibil ity for a temporary Medical Exemption) . In the interim, they will be treated as if they are not Fully Vaccinated. University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 14 of 34 21. I was vaccinated in another country , where the government increased the time between first and second vaccines to longer than the CDC and FDA advise . Do I have to be revaccinated? No. If you have proof of completing a series of any FDA - licensed or FDA - or WHO -authorized vaccine consistent with your country's implementation, you will be considered to have been Fully Vaccinated. 22. I cannot come bac k to campus 3- 4 weeks before school starts, and I can't access any vaccine in my country. Will I be allowed on campus? Yes. You will be allowed on campus but will be referred to a vaccine site to get vaccinated immediately, unless you qualify for a Univer sity-approved Exception or Deferral . Until you are F ully Vaccinated, you will be subject to the NPIs described in Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies for unvaccinated individuals. Additional safety measures may be deemed necessary, depending on the circumstances, by local public health, environmental health and safety, occupational health, or infection prevention authorities, including the Location Vaccine Authority. 23. How does the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) order regarding COVID -19 vaccination of health care workers affect employees at the University's Medical centers, health professional schools, and clinics? The August 5, 2021 CDPH order requires that health care workers have their first dose of a one-dose regimen or their second dose of a two- dose regimen for COVID -19 by September 30, 2021 unless they decline the vaccine on one of the limited grounds recognized by the order. Importantly, some exceptions and deferrals available under the University's SARS- CoV-2 policy are not available to work ers and trainees in health care settings under the CDPH order. Specifically, Covered Individuals under the UC policy who work, train, or otherwise access any UC health facilities - including medical centers, ambulatory surgery centers, Student Health Servi ces, Counseling & Psychological Services, and other campus - and school -based medical and behavioral health clinics - may decline vaccination only based on \"Qualifying Medical Reasons\" or \"Religious Beliefs\" under the Medical Reasons\" include only CDC -recognized contraindications and precautions. This corresponds with the University policy's definition of Medical Exemption. Although the University is also allowing temporary Medical Exemptions under its policy for Covered Indivi duals who have been diagnosed with or treated for COVID -19 in the last 90 days (see FAQ #9 above), this would not be a Qualifying Medical Reason under the CDPH order unless the treatment constitutes a CDC -recognized contraindication or precaution. For these reasons, after September 30, 2021, the University will be unable to grant or continue to honor the following for health care workers: (a) Medical Exemptions based on COVID -19 diagnosis or treatment within the last 90 days - unless the treatment qualifies as a CDC- recognized contraindication or precaution, (b) Exceptions based on Disabilities that are not CDC -recognized contraindications or precautions, or (c) Deferrals. The CDPH order requires that any declination based on Qualifying Medical Reasons be supported by a written statement from a \"physician, nurse practitioner, or other University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 15 of 34 licensed medical professional practicing under the license of a physician\" (that is, a physician, a nurse practitioner or other advance practice nurse, or a physician's assist ant). Covered Individuals should use the University's Medical Exemption and/or Disability Exception Request form to decline the vaccine for Qualifying Medical Reasons under the CDPH order. That form includes a certification for the health care provider to complete. Likewise, Covered Individuals should use the University's Religious Exception request form to decline the vaccine for Religious Beliefs under the CDPH order. Additional information is available in Frequently Asked Questions attached to the order. The CDPH order, like the University's policy, requires individuals who are not Fully Vaccinated but are permitted to be Physically Pr esent on the basis of an approved Exception to comply with Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions to help avoid preventable transmission of COVID -19. 24. How does the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) order discussed in FAQ #23 impact Covered Individuals who are hired to work at UC health care facilities on or after October 1, 2021? Covered Individuals hired to work at UC health care facilities (as described in FAQ #23) on or after October 1, 2021 must be in compliance with the CDPH order as of their start date. To comply with the order, by their start date, they must either (a) have their first dose of a one dose regimen or their second dose of a two- dose regimen for COVID -19 or (b) meet the order's requirements with regard to declining th e vaccine based on \"Religious Beliefs\" or \"Qualifying Medical Reasons.\" FAQ #23 addresses the order's requirements with regard to declining the vaccine. 25. I'm a new University of California employee hired on or after October 20, 2021. What's my deadline for complying with this policy ? Complying with this policy is a condition of employment. If you're a Covered Individual as defined by this policy, you must do one of the following no later than 14 calendar days after your first date of employment: (a) provide proof that you have received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 Vaccine; or (b) if applicable, submit a request for Exception or Deferral. If you submit proof that you have received at least one dose of a COVID -19 Vaccine but you have not yet completed the COVID -19 Vaccine series, you must then provide proof that you are Fully Vaccinated no later than eight weeks after your first date of employment. Covered Individuals subject to the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) order must be in compliance with the CDPH order as of their start date. Please see FAQ #23 and FAQ #24 for more information on the CDPH order. And Covered Individuals who are student employees must provide proof of Full Vaccination or, if applicable, submit a request for Exception or Deferral no later than the first date of instruction for the term when they first enroll.

A PPENDIX E: EXCEPTIONS AND DEFERRALS These Guidelines apply to Covered Individuals who physically access a University Location/Facility or University Program in connection with their employment or appointment and who have requested an Exception to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement based on Medical Exemption, Disability, and/or Religious Objection or who have requested a Deferral of that requirement based on pregnancy. I. DEFINITIONS All terms in the \"Definitions\" section of the Program apply to these Guidelines. Additional Term: Decision : The determination of the approval or denial of an Exception or Deferral request. II. ADMINISTRATION OF REQUESTS A. Establishment of a Responsible Office 1. Locations should designate a particular office(s) and/or individual(s) to field Exception or Deferral requests and make this Responsible Office known to Personnel. 2. This Office might be different for each type of Exception or Deferral allowed under the Program - e.g. Medical Exemption or Disability Exception requests may be processed by a different Office from the Religious Objection Exception requests. 3. Locations can opt to utilize Third Party Administrator (TPA) Sedgwick to support the administration and review of Medical Exemptions, Disability Exceptions, Religious Objection Exceptions, and/or Deferrals due to pregnancy. If utilizing this option, the Location must still designate a Responsible Office to manage the coordination with Sedgwick. B. Documentation of the Request 1. The Responsible Office is responsible for reporting all Exception and Deferral requests, approvals, and denials to the Local Vaccine Authority (LVA) at the Location. 2. The Responsible Office should make Exception and Deferral Request Forms (see Program, Appendix D) publicly available to Personnel and available upon University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 26 of 34 request. Locations utilizing the TPA should provide full name and email address (individually or in a flat list format such as an Excel table) to the TPA; Sedgwick will then reply with the applicable Exception or Deferral Request Form. . 3. Either the Responsible Office or TPA should eval uate the Exception or Deferral request using the applicable standardized criteria. The Responsible Office should use the Approval or Denial Form to record the Decision. 4. The Responsible Office will exercise best practice information security procedures and comply with BFB-IS-3 (Electronic Information Security Policy) as well as BFB-RMP -1 (the University Records Management Program) when s toring Program records (e.g., Exception and Deferral request forms, approval forms, denial forms, related communications) and when notifying the LVA regarding pending requests for Exceptions or Deferrals and Exception or Deferral Decisions. Program records should be kept confidential and only accessed for Program -related purposes. Program records should not be stored in an employee's personnel file. C. Standardized Communications and Process 1. All forms and notifications should follow standard templates. Location -specific forms may include consistently communicated modifications such as campus - specific non -pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) requirements, Responsible Office contact information, etc. 2. Communications and forms regarding Exceptions and Deferrals (including request forms, notifications such as a notice of pending request, notice of approval, and notice of denial) should be standardized as much as possible regardless of medium (e.g., digital/e- mail vs. hard- copy) or the office sending the communication (e.g., local Responsible Office or Sedgwick). 3. Communications should be made in a timely fashion, both acknowledging receipt of the request and communicating the subsequent Decision. D. Pending and Granted Exceptions and Deferrals Require Employee Use of NPI All forms and references to Exception and Deferral requests should clearly state that, as a condition of Physical Presence, employees are required to comply with the Location's NPI requirements (e.g., face coverings, regular asymptomatic testing) while an Exc eption or Deferral request is pending or after such requests have been approved. NPI requirements may be amended and communicated to employees subsequently, such as if public health conditions prompt revisions to NPI requirements. See Appendix D of the Program for recommended model form language. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Covered Individuals subject to the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health order (see Section IV below), compliance with the order is required as a condition of Phys ical Presence at any UC health care facility after September 30, 2021. Therefore, such Covered Individuals are not University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 27 of 34 allowed to be Physically Present at any UC health care facility after September 30, 2021 while their requests are pending . III. DECISION PROCESS A. The Responsible Office will evaluate all Exception and Deferral requests consistently in both the application of the Guidelines and treatment of similarly situated Personnel throughout the University. For those Covered Individuals who are subject to the A ugust 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health order requiring COVID - 19 vaccination for health care workers (see Section IV below), evaluation of such requests will also consider the requirements of that order. The Responsible Office will utilize sy stem -wide training for individuals charged with evaluating Exception or Deferral requests. The Responsible Office will stay up to date on training, which may be amended as new information or changes to conditions (i.e., Public Health) may require. B. The Resp onsible Office will contact Personnel in a timely fashion in the event that an incomplete form is submitted or more information is needed in order to evaluate the request. IV. THE AUGUST 5, 2021 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER A. The August 5, 2021 C alifornia Department of Public Health order (\"CDPH order\") order requires that health care workers subject to the order receive their first dose of a one- dose regimen or the second dose of a two- dose regimen of the COVID -19 vaccination by September 30, 2021 unless they decline the vaccination based on \"Religious Beliefs\" or \"Qualifying Medical Reasons.\" B. Covered Individuals under the UC Program who work, train, or otherwise access any UC health care facilities - including medical centers, ambulatory surgery centers, Student Health Services, Counseling & Psychology Services, and other campus - and school -based medical and behavioral clinics - cannot be Physically Present at such facilities after September 30, 2021 if they are not in compliance with the CDPH order. C. \"Qualifying Medical Reasons\" under the CDPH order include only CDC -recognized contraindications or precautions. D. Given the requirements of the CDPH order, the University will be unable to approve or continue to honor the following for Covered Indivi duals subject to the CDPH order after September 30, 2021: (1) Medical Exemptions based on COVID -19 diagnosis or treatment within the last 90 days - unless the treatment qualifies as a CDC - recognized contraindication or precaution, (2) Exceptions based on D isabilities that are not CDC -recognized contraindications or precautions, or (3) Deferrals. E. Covered Individuals should use the University's Medical Exemption and/or Disability Exception Request Form to decline the vaccine for Qualifying Medical Reasons under the CDPH order and should use the University's Religious Exception Request Form to decline the vaccine for Religious Beliefs under the CDPH order .

APPENDIX E REVISION HISTORY First Effective Date : July 20, 2021 Amended: September 16, 2021 (added language regarding the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health order)University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 29 of 34 APPENDIX F: EMPLOYEE COMPLIANCE I. SUMMARY The purpose of the Program is to facilitate the protection of the health and safety of the University community. The Program requires employees to be Fully Vaccinated against COVID -19 before physically accessing the University's Locations/Facilities or University Programs, subject to specified Exceptions and Deferrals. These Guidelines provide information regarding compliance with the Program by University of California policy -covered staff and Academic Personnel Manual (APM) -covered academic appointees. The University desires a consistent approach for all employee populations, including represented employees, subject to its c ollective bargaining obligations, applicable collective bargaining agreements, and applicable public health orders . II. EMPLOYEE REQUIREMENTS BY IMPLEMENTATION DATE The COVID -19 vaccination requirement applies to UC employees who physically access the Universi ty's Locations/Facilities or University Programs in connection with their employment or appointment. As a condition of Physical Presence at a University Location/Facility or in a University Program, all of these UC employees must provide proof of Full Vacc ination or submit a request for an Exception or Deferral no later than the applicable implementation date. For employees who are subject to the August 5, 2021 CDPH order, compliance with that order is also a condition of Physical Presence at any UC health care facility after September 30, 2021. (See Sections II.D and IV of Appendix E). III. TIMELINE The path to full compliance with the Program for each employee, including the notices provided, may differ depending upon the date that the employee complies with each compliance step or submits a Request for Exception or Deferral. IV.

(See Sections II.D and IV of Appendix E). A. Request Approved If an Exception or Deferral is granted, the issuing office must notify the employee and the Location Vaccine Authority of the approval and the associated expiration date, if any. The employee must, as a condition of Physical Presence, comply with NPIs defined by the Location. University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 30 of 34 B. Request Denied If an employee has submitted a single request for an Exception or Deferral that has been denied, or requests on more than one ground that have all been fully considered and denied, the employee (\"Non- Excepted Employee\" hereafter) will receive a Denial of R equest for Exception or Deferral. 1. Employee Chooses to Become Fully Vaccinated If the Non -Excepted Employee chooses to become Fully Vaccinated, they must provide proof that they have received their first shot within 14 calendar days of the date of denial. T his proof must include the date of the first shot. Until the Non -Excepted Employee is Fully Vaccinated, they must, as a condition of Physical Presence, comply with NPIs defined by the Location. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees subject to the August 5, 2021 CDPH order cannot be Physically Present at any UC health care facility after September 30, 2021 if they are not in compliance with that order. (See Sections II.D and IV of Appendix E). If the Non -Excepted Employee receives the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, they will be considered Fully Vaccinated two weeks after the date of the first shot. If they receive the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, they will be considered Fully Vaccinated two weeks after the date of the second shot. Proof of Full Vaccination mus t be provided no later than eight weeks from the date of the denial. If either of the dates above falls on a weekend or University holiday, the deadline for providing the required proof is the next business day that is not a University holiday. 2. Employee Chooses Not to Start the Vaccination Process If the Non -Excepted Employee chooses not to receive their first shot within 14 calendar days of the date of denial, the applicable process begins at Section V.A. V. EMPLOYEE NON -COMPLIANCE A. First Notice of Non- Com pliance (All Employees) UC employees subject to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement who fail to provide proof of Full Vaccination and who have not requested an Exception or Deferral by the applicable implementation date (or Non- Excepted Employees, who fai l to provide proof that they have received their first shot within the 14 calendar days as described in Section IV.B.2) will receive a First Notice of Non- Compliance. B. Three -Day Period Following First Notice of Non- Compliance (All Employees) Once an employ ee has received a First Notice of Non- Compliance, they will have three business days to provide proof of Full Vaccination or to make a request for an University of California - Policy SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Vaccination Program 31 of 34 Exception or Deferral (or, in the case of a Non- Excepted Employee, to provide proof that they have receive d their first shot or, if applicable, to make a new request). During these three business days, the employee must, as a condition of Physical Presence, comply with NPIs defined by the Location. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees subject to the August 5, 2021 CDPH order cannot be Physically Present at any UC health care facility after September 30, 2021 if they are not in compliance with that order.

What is the relationship between this policy and the interim policy? This final policy replaces the interim policy. The final COVID -19 vaccination policy is the product of continued review of evidence from medical studies concerning the dangerousness of COVID -19 as well as the safe ty and effectiveness of vaccines for preventing infection, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID -19, and for reducing the spread of this deadly disease . The final policy is also the product of consultation with the UC community that began in April , which revealed strong support for moving forward with a vaccination requirement now. To maintain the health and well -being of the campus community and that of the general public , the COVID -19 vaccination requirement applies to students and employees alike, including faculty, academic appointees , staff, postdoctoral researchers , trainees , as a condition of their physical access UC facilities , as well as in -person participation in UC programs that may occur off-site (such as UC athletics programs or study abroad) . UC arrived at this policy after reviewing the safety and efficacy of the three vaccines approved at the time by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use, and after considering the severe risks presented by a virus that has killed more than 64 0,000 people in the United States alone as well as the rise of variants that are more transmissible and more virulent . Since then, FDA has licensed (fully approved) the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine for individuals age 16 and above. 2. When does the final policy go into effect? This final policy take s effect immediately, with a systemwide deadline for submit ting proof of vaccination that depends on the location's calendar . That deadline also applies to request s for an allowable exception (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (based on pregnancy). The systemwide submittal deadline is two (2) weeks before the first day of Fall 2021 instruction at any University campus or school ; or September 1, 2021, for locations that do not operate on an academic calendar (e.g., UCOP, ANR, medical c enters, national laborat ories). 3. Does this final policy require vaccination for all employees or only those who work on-site? The requirement to provide proof of COVID -19 vaccination (or to submit a request for exception on medical, disability or religious grounds, or for a deferral based on pregnancy) takes effect for all faculty, academic appointees and staff as a condition of in -person access to UC locations or programs two weeks pr ior to the first day of instruction at the campus or school in the fall 2021 academic term (or, for locations not on academic calendars, September 1, 2021). Even if the employee's job does not ordinarily require them to work on- site, they would still need to provide UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 2 of 8 proof of full vaccination (or submit a request for exception or deferral) before physically accessing UC facilities, such as to attend mandated staff meetings or trainings in person. The University continues to encourage all individuals to be vaccinated even if they will not be on-site at UC locations this fall. V accination against the virus that causes COVID -19 is a critical step for protecting the health and safety of our communities and ending the pandemic. 4. Will this requirement apply to union- represented employees? Yes, in accordance with any applicable collective- bargaining requirements. 5. Does this requirement apply to postdocs on the same basis? Yes, t he policy requires postdoctoral researchers and trainees , who are accessing a UC facility or program in person to receive a COVID -19 vaccine, subject to the allowable exceptions (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (based on pregnancy). 6. How can employees get vaccines? Will UC offer vaccinations? UC encourages faculty, academic appointees and staff to look for opportunities near their homes to be vaccinated, such as at local pharmacies. In California, you may also seek a vaccination appointment online at myturn.ca.gov or by calling 1- 833-422-4255 Monday through Friday from 8 am to 8 pm or Saturday and Sunday from 8 am to 5 pm. All locations that are campuses and medical centers will offer COVID -19 vaccination on- site or maintain a list of nearby and accessible off -site locations offering vaccination to people covered by this policy. This provision of the policy is not intended to restrict an individual's choice of provider but to maximize their access to the vaccine. 7. Will non -exempt employees and hourly academic appointees receive paid time off to receive the SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) vaccine? Yes, non -exempt employees and hourly academic appointees may take up to four hours of paid time to obtain each dose of the SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) vaccine. Employees and appointees must provide advance notice to their supervisor. If an employee or appointee needs more time for this purpose, they may request Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL) (Reason 3(d)) for the additional time. Berkeley Lab employees should contact Berkeley Lab HR for assistance. 8. Is this a one -time mandate or will I be required to get boosters or annual shots? This is a permanent policy. Infectious disease experts anticipate that annual or more frequent boosters will be necessary , and receipt of boosters will be required, consistent with product labeling, in the same way that the initial vaccination is required by this policy and subject to the same exceptions and d eferrals. UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 3 of 8 9. What does \"fully vaccinated\" mean? Does it refer to one or two shots depending on vaccine? Does it include a period of time after the dose for an immune response? A person is considered \"fully\" vaccinated \" when two weeks have passed since they completed a COVID -19 vaccine series (for example, 1 dose of the Janssen/J&J vaccine, or 2 doses within no more than 12 weeks of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine) as well as any boosters consistent with manufacturer 's instructions and applicable agency approval, authorization, or listing. 10. How do I demonstrate proof of vaccination? Who will maintain the documentation? Individuals covered by this policy must submit proof of their vaccination to their Location Vaccine Aut hority. This requirement can be satisfied by providing a copy of the individual's CDC vaccination card or non -U.S. equivalent; official documentation issued by a State vaccine registry; or an official medical record. Individuals covered by this policy who seek an exception (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (during pregnancy) must complete the request form and submit it to their location's Responsible Office. Model forms have been published with this final policy for adaptation or as -is use by each location. Employees should use the forms adopted by their location. Details will be communicated by each UC location to its employees . 11. Are medical exemptions or disability or religious accommodations allowed? Yes. Requests for an exception based on a m edical exemption, disability, or religious belief will be considered . Employees whose requests are pending or have been granted will still be subject to special requirements such as increased surveillance testing. Model forms have been published with this final policy for adaptation or as -is use by each location. Employees should use the forms adopted by their campus. Details will be communicated by each UC location to its employees . 12. Why is UC allowing exceptions for reasons other than medical exemption (e.g., for reasons other than a contraindication or precaution to receiving the vaccine established by the CDC or the manufacturer) ? The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to individuals who qualify for an exception to the vaccination requirement based on their disability , as well as to employees who object to vaccination based on their sincerely -held relig ious belief, practice, or observance. A decision was made to apply the COVID -19 vaccine mandate consistently across all groups of individuals covered by this policy . Vaccination against the virus that causes COVID -19 is a critical step for protecting the health and safety of our communities and ending the pandemic. 13. I am pregnant. Will I be eligible for a medical exemption? No, but, unless you work in a University health care facility, you are eligible for a deferral throughout your pregnancy until the time that you return to in-person work or instruction, as applicable, following pregnancy. You may also be eligible for a disability accommodation. It is UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 4 of 8 important to understand, however, the additional risks you and your baby will be exposed to if you contract COVID -19 during pregnancy: According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , \"pregnant people and recently pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID -19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with pregnant people without COVID -19.\" By contrast, researchers have found that COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy may protect babies from COVID -19 infection through the placenta before birth and through breas tfeeding afterwards. A recent study performed by UC researchers concluded that risk of very preterm birth, which occurs at less than 32 weeks of gestation, was 60 percent higher for people infected with COVID -19 at some point in their pregnancy, while the risk of giving birth at less than 37 weeks (all preterm births) was 40 percent higher in those with infection. For those who also had hypertension, diabetes and/or obesity as well as COVID -19, the risk of preterm birth rose 160 percent. There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccines, cause female or male fertility problems. Accordingly, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all eligible individuals, including those who are pregnant or lactating, be vaccinated. The University strongly supports vaccination for all students, trainees, personnel, and patients who do not have contraindications to one of the vaccines. Note: those who work in University health facilities or clinics are subject to an order issued in early August by the California Department of Public Health that does not allow for exceptions or deferrals based on pregnancy, and therefore must have their first dose of a one-dose COVID -19 regimen or their second dose of a two-dose COVID -19 regimen by September 30, 2021. 14. I was recently diagnosed with COVID -19, and/or I had an antibody test that shows that I have natural immunity. Does this support a medical exemption? You may be eligible for a temporary medical exemption (and, therefore, a temporary e xception), for up to 90 days after your diagnosis. According to the US Food and Drug Administration , however, \"a positive result from an antibody test does not mean you have a specific amount of immunity or protection from SARS -CoV-2 infection ... Currently authorized SARS -CoV-2 antibody tests are not validated to evaluate specific immunity or protection from SARS -CoV-2 infection.\" For this reason, individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID -19 or had an antibody test are not permanently exempt from vaccination. 15. How do I apply for an e xception or d eferral? Individuals covered by this policy who seek an exception (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (during pregnancy) must complete the request form and submit it to their UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 5 of 8 location's Responsible Office. Model forms have been published with this final policy for adaptation or as -is use by each location. Employees should use the forms adopted by their location. Details will be communicated by each UC location to its employees. 16. If I have applied for or been granted an e xception or d eferral, what non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will I be required to observe? See Appendix A: COVID -19 Prevention Strategies , which describes required NPIs. Additional safety measures may be deemed necessary, depending on t he circumstances, by local public health, environmental health and safety, occupational health, or infection prevention authorities, including the Location Vaccine Authority. In that case, a person who has received an approved exception or d eferral (or whose request is pending) will be informed of any additional requirements . 17. Will a vaccine that is under emergency use authorization and not final FDA approval satisfy the requirement? Yes, all COVID- 19 vaccines offered under emergency use authorization (EUA) \u2014or full approval by the FDA , as granted to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine on August 23, 2021\u2014will satisfy the vaccination requirement. 18. What if I am not eligible for a vaccine? All people ages 12 and older across the United States are now eligible to receive a vaccine. Employees who are eligible for a vaccine but wish to decline it may qualify for an exception (on medical, disability, or religious grounds) or deferral (based on pregnancy) under the policy. To allow time for processing such requests, employees should submit their requests as soon as possible, and no later than the submittal deadline: two (2) weeks before the first day of Fall 2021 instruction at any University campus or school ; or September 1, 2021, for locations that do not operate on an academic calendar (e.g., UCOP , ANR, medical c enters, national laboratories). 19. Who will pay for the vaccine? Initial supplies have been paid for by the federal government. Vaccines administered by the University to consenting covered individuals as part of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program (e.g., during vaccine clinics or at employee health or occupational health offices) are administered free of charge. In addition, all of the University's health plans cover CDC -recommended vaccines administered by an employee's primary care physician or at a local pharmacy. 20. Will the University accept internationally approved vaccines even if not authorized or approved in the United States? Yes, if the vaccine authorized by the World Health Organization (WHO). UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 6 of 8 The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a process for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics during a public health emergencies. Thr ough that process, a number of vaccines not available in the United States have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). A document summarizing the status of a wide range of international vaccines can be found online on the WHO's website (click on link to status of COVID- 19 vaccines in the EUL/PQ evaluation process). The University will, consistent with CDC and CDPH guidance, accept proof of full vaccination with any international vaccine that has been authorized for emergency use by WHO through the EUL process. People who have completed a COVID -19 vaccination series with one of these vaccines do not need additional doses with an FDA - licensed or -authorized COVID -19 vaccine, at least initially (but may be subject to subsequent booster requirements). Those who are not fully vaccinated generally will be required to receive an FDA -licensed or - authorized vaccine no less than 28 days after their last international vaccination (but may consult with the L ocation Vaccine Authority or designee to discuss eligibility for a temporary medical exemption) . In the interim, they will be treated as if they are not fully vaccinated . 21. I was vaccinated in a country where the government increased the time between first and second vaccines longer than US labeling . Do I have to be revaccinated? No. If you have proof of completing a series of any FDA -licensed or FDA - or WHO -authorized vaccine consistent with your countr y's implementation, you will be considered to have been fully vaccinated. 22. What if I experience flu -like symptoms as a result of the vaccine , and I cannot work? Employees should contact their supervisors or local human resources offices for instruction but as a general matter, accrued sick leave, vacation, and/or PTO may be used to take time off as needed to recover. Before September 30, 2021, employees may also request EPSL (Reason 3(e)) for that purpose. 23. I am at high risk for severe illness if I contract COVID -19 (e.g., immunocompromised) and even though I have been vaccinated, I know that no vaccine is 100% effective. Do I have to come to campus if my co -workers or students are not all vaccinated? What accommodations will be made for me? Please contact your local disability services office to discuss your situation and possible accommodations. 24. How will enforcement work for failure to participate in the program ? Efforts will be made to encourage p articipation in the COVID -19 vaccination program prior to the implementation date. Requirements related to employee compliance are generally addressed in Appendix F of the policy ; note that, for health care workers, the August 5, 2021 CDPH order requires that they have their first dose of a one- dose regimen or their second dose of a two - dose regimen for COVID -19 by September 30, 2021, unless they decline the vaccine on one of the limited grounds recognized by the order. See FAQ #25 below for more information. Students UC COVID -19 Vaccination Policy Employee FAQs Updated October 20 , 2021 Page 7 of 8 who fail to p articipate by being vaccin ated or requesting an e xception or d eferral on or before the implementation date will be barred from physical presence at University f acilities and programs, and may experience consequences as a result of non- participation, up to and including dismissal fr om educational programs. 25. How does the August 5, 2021 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) order regarding COVID -19 vaccination of health care workers affect employees at the University's Medical centers, health professional schools, and clinics? The August 5, 2021 CDPH order requires that health care workers have their first dose of a one- dose regimen or their second dose of a two-dose regimen for COVID -19 by September 30, 2021 unless they decline the vaccine on one of the limited grounds recognized by the order. Importantly, some exceptions and deferrals available under the University's SARS- CoV- 2 policy are not available to workers and trainees in health care settings under the CDPH order. Specifically, Covered Individuals under the UC policy who work, train, or otherwise access any UC health facilities - including medical centers, ambulatory surgery centers, Student Health Services, Counseling & Psychological Services, and other campus - and school -based medical and behavioral health clinics - may decline vaccination only based on \"Qualifying Medical Reasons\" or \"Religious Beliefs\" under Reasons\" include only CDC- recognized contraindications and precautions. This corresponds with the University policy's definition of Medical Exemption. Although the University is also allowing temporary medical exemptions under its policy for covered individuals who have been diagnosed with or treated for COVID -19 in the last 90 days (see FAQ #14 above), this would not be a qualifying medical reason under the CDPH order unless the treatment constitutes a CDC- recognized contraindication or precaution. For these reasons, after September 30, 2021, the University will be unable to grant or continue to honor the following for health care workers: (a) medical exemptions based on COVID -19 diagnosis or treatment within the last 90 days - unless the treatment qualifies as a CDC- recognized contraindication or precaution, (b) exceptions based on disabilities that are not CDC- recognized contraindications or precautions, or (c) deferrals. The CDPH order requires that any declinati on based on qualifying medical reasons be supported by a written statement from a \"physician, nurse practitioner, or other licensed medical professional practicing under the license of a physician\" (that is, a physician, a nurse practitioner or other advance practice nurse, or a physician's assistant). Covered individuals should use the University's medical exemption and/or disability exception request form to decline the vaccine for qualifying medical reasons under the CDPH order. That form includes a certification for the health care provider to complete. Likewise, covered individuals should use the University's religious exception request form to decline the vaccine for religious beliefs under the CDPH order. Additional information is available in Frequently Asked Questions attached to the order. The CDPH order, like the University's policy, requires individuals who are not fully vaccinated but are permitted to be physically present on the basis of an approved exception to comply with non-pharmaceutical interventions to help avoid preventable transmission of COVID -19.
