This study evaluates the effect of combining non pharmacological and pharmacological method to prevent such condition. Aromatherapy has been used since many years to treat nausea and vomiting. One of the proposed mechanism is by the activation of olfactory receptor when the molecules of essential oil absorb in the mucus lining olfactory epithelium. The signal is then carried by olfactory sensory neuron to the olfactory bulb which filters and send signal to olfactory cortex as well as limbic system to give the feeling of well being. Granisetron is a serotonin 3 receptor antagonist prevent or treat nausea and vomiting by competitively blocks the action of serotonin at 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5HT3) receptors while the mechanism of action of dexamethasone; which is a glucocorticoids is not fully understood.
