Understanding chronic pain Chronic pain is a serious medical problem. It's defined as pain that lasts longer than 3 months. Chronic pain includes pain that you feel regularly, even if it comes and goes. The pain may be from an ongoing injury or health problem. Or it may be because of a chronic pain syndrome, such as fibromyalgia. Sometimes pain persists when no cause can be found. Pain should be treated You have a right to have your pain treated. Untreated chronic pain can affect your overall health. It can lead to depression, anxiety, anger, and personality changes. It can also disrupt work, sleep, relationships, and other aspects of normal life. It may not be possible to relieve all of your pain. But it can be reduced to a level you can cope with. Your role in treatment Your healthcare provider will work closely with you on a plan to manage your pain. But it's up to you to put this plan into action. Control of chronic pain is done mainly through self-management. This means that you take an active role in your care. Getting support from family and friends is important too. Planning your treatment Your healthcare provider will first look for a cause of your pain that can be treated. They will also assess your pain level. This may be done by asking you to rate your pain on a scale from 1 (low pain) to 10 (severe pain). Your provider will also ask you to describe the pain. For instance, is your pain sharp or dull? Is it constant or does it come and go? You may be asked to keep a pain log. This is a diary in which you track your pain. It may help identify things that tend to make your pain worse. You and your healthcare provider can make a plan to help prevent and cope with pain on a daily basis. In some cases, you may be referred to a special pain program or clinic. Your treatment plan may include: Medicines Medicine will most likely be a part of your treatment plan. Your provider will evaluate which are the best medicines for your pain. You may use over-the-counter or prescription medicines. You may need to take more than 1 medicine. It may take some time to find the best medicine or combination of medicines for your pain.

Your provider will keep track of your care very closely if you take opioids to reduce the risk for addiction. Complementary therapies These are treatments that can be used along with medical care to help relieve pain. Look for a licensed practitioner with experience treating chronic pain. Talk with your healthcare provider about using complementary therapies, such as: Mind/body therapies The brain and the body are both part of the pain response. The brain reads the pain signals from the body. This means that your mind has some control over how pain signals are processed. Mind/body therapies may help change how your brain reads pain signals. They may be learned with the help of a trained therapist or in a class.

It can improve your ability to cope with pain. It may also help improve your mood, sleep, and overall health. Your healthcare provider can help you plan an exercise program that's right for your needs. This may include: - Stretching and range-of-motion exercises - Low-impact exercise, such as walking, biking, swimming, and other water exercise - Strength training using light weights - Walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator - Riding a bike instead of driving - Parking your car farther from your destination You may need to stay away from high-impact activities. These involve jumping, running, or sudden starts, stops, or changes of direction. If you haven't exercised in a long time or you have physical limitations, your healthcare provider may refer you to a physical therapist.
