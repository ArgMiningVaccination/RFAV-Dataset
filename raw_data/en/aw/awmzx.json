[Isadora Baum](/author/217302/isadora-baum/)and [Lauryn Higgins](/author/263211/lauryn-higgins/) [Protein](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a41958183/how-much-proten-do-you-need/) is not only super-important for building strong, lean muscles, it's also a rich source of energy for your body. It keeps your metabolism revved throughout the day, says nutritionist [Kelly Jones](https://kellyjonesnutrition.com/), RD. It fills you up too. \"Since protein moves more slowly through the stomach than carbohydrates and fat, it can contribute to feelings of fullness,\" says Jones. So, eating high-protein meals (that also pack some fat and fiber) can help you stave off mindless snacking throughout the day. The [USDA recommends](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/usda-protein-requirements-grams-8619.html) that women consume 46 grams of protein daily. And protein is especially important for anyone who regularly hits up bootcamp class or never misses a gym day. That said, many factors affect how much protein your body needs, says nutritionist [Roxana Ehsani](https://roxanaehsani.com/), RDN. \"Women on a caloric restriction diet could benefit from consuming higher amounts of protein to help preserve lean body mass,\" she explains. \"If a person wants to gain weight, it might be helpful to bump up their protein as well to help them eat more calories.\" If you're [vegetarian or vegan](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a25804908/plant-based-diet/), you may need to increase your intake too. A pro tip for figuring out exactly how much protein you should eat at each meal: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.13, Jones says. For a 130-pound person, that's about 17 grams per meal; for a 200-pound person, that's about 26 grams. If you don't feel like doing the math, packing anywhere between 15 and 35 grams of protein per meal is ideal, according to Ehsani. \"You can easily achieve this amount with a four-ounce serving of chicken, two eggs paired with whole-grain toast, or tofu paired with [quinoa](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a23570613/quinoa-health-benefits/),\" says Jones. Other [great sources of protein](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19892506/high-protein-foods/) include meat, seafood, eggs, Greek yogurt, beans, lentils, and nuts and seeds.
