Traditional Allopathic Medicine does not have a solution other than medication that has harmful side-effects. We are here to help you address the underlying CAUSE of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome by educating you to that specific cause. Once you understand what is creating your Chronic Fatigue, you can then begin on the road to health and wellness and put this difficult chapter in your life behind you. To Request an Action Plan to Address Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Symptoms of CFS Symptoms of CFS are similar to those of the flu and other common viral infections, and include muscle aches, [headache](headaches.asp), and [extreme fatigue](fatigue.asp). However, symptoms of CFS last for 6 months or more. The main symptom of CFS is extreme tiredness (fatigue), which is: Other symptoms include: The exact cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is unknown from a Traditional Allopathic Medical perspective. Some theories suggest CFS may be due to [Epstein-Barr virus](ebvepstein-barrvirus.asp) or human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6); There are also some theories about the Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) 150 virus. This is the official opinion of the CDC. However, no specific virus has been identified as the cause from a Traditional Medical perspective. Beyond these viruses, another theorized cause is inflammation in the nervous system due to a faulty immune system response. CFS is most commonly diagnosed in women ages 30 to 50. It is suspected the following may also play a role in the development of CFS: Medicines Perspective There is currently no cure for CFS from a medical perspective. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, as many people with CFS suffer from [depression ](depression.asp)and other psychological disorders that may improve with treatment. This will usually require being prescribed medication. Treatment may include various combinations of the following: When medications are involved, remember that in some people they can cause reactions or side-effects that are worse than the original symptoms of the disease. Always know what to look for before taking any medication prescribed. Be sure to read the information that comes with your medication, especially the side-effects and complications associated with the medication. Tips include: Relaxation techniques include: Expectations (prognosis) The long-term outlook for patients with CFS varies and is difficult to predict when symptoms first start. Some patients completely recover after 6 months to a year, while others may never feel like they did before they developed CFS again. There is hope though, as studies suggest that you are more likely to get better if you receive extensive rehabilitation. Appreciate that none of this sounds very promising. This is why we recommend Alternative Medical Treatment. Continue reading below. Dr. Huntoon has seen far too many patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome over the years and each one has demonstrated having the ME 150 virus. Having learned a specific technique to treat and resolve CFS using Total Body Modification (TBM), Dr. Huntoon is confident the underlying cause is the ME 150 virus. Once treated and resolved, then restoring health and balance to the person who has suffered becomes vital to full resolution of that person's health. CFS can be a terrible condition as you can end up to tired to really enjoy life. With the underlying causes being unknown, and no traditional medical treatment available, many patients turn to a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) for help in managing their condition. Working with a Holistic Chiropractor can offer exceptional benefits, as using a [well-rounded, multifaceted approach ](OurUniqueApproach.asp)to addressing your health can lead to substantial life improvements. A properly developed personal treatment plan has demonstrated positive results. Patients with CFS are encouraged to maintain active social lives and may find mild physical exercise to be helpful. Your health care team will help you figure out how much activity you can do, and how to slowly increase your activity. We have also seen patients benefiting from Acupuncture, Homeopathy and Naturopathy when they followed the treatment guidelines set up by your practitioner. I will be happy to discussing what is involved, and the time commitment necessary for your personalized treatment. As traditional medical science continues to offer no solutions, if you or someone you love is suffering from CFS call me and I can help. Signs and Tests The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) describes CFS as a distinct disorder with specific symptoms and physical signs, based on ruling out other possible causes. CFS is diagnosed after your health care provider rules out other possible causes of fatigue, including: There are no specific tests to confirm the diagnosis of CFS from a Traditional Medical Testing perspective. There have been reports of CFS patients having abnormal results on Brain MRI and White blood cell count tests. However not all patients with CFS will show abnormal results and therefore these tests can only be of limited help in establishing a diagnosis. Research into CFS, how to fully diagnose, and how to treat it is still ongoing. Calling Your Health Care Provider Call for an appointment with your healthcare provider if you experience persistent, severe fatigue, with or without other symptoms of this disorder. Other more serious disorders can cause similar symptoms and should be ruled out.
