Therapeutic Lifestyle Change: Diet for Patients Dyslipidemias in Chronic Kidney Disease Work Group Membership BertramKasiske,MD, Chair HennepinCountyMedicalCenter National Kidney Foun- dation (NKF) launched the Dialysis Out- comes Quality Initiative (DOQI), supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Amgen,Inc, to develop clinical practice guidelines thatwould improve outcomes of patients on mainte-nance dialysis. Since their publication in 1997,the DOQI guidelines have had a signicant anddocumented impact on the care and outcomes ofdialysispatients. 1Inthecourseofdevelopingthe DOQIguidelines,itbecameevidentthatinorderto actually improve dialysis outcomes it wasnecessary to improve the health status of thosewho reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD), andthat therein existed an even greater opportunityto improve outcomes for all individuals withchronic kidney disease (CKD), from its earliestonset through its various stages of progressiveloss of kidney function, when the complicationsof CKD develop resulting in an increasing num-ber of comorbidities with which patients withkidney failure present for dialysis. It was on thisbasis that, in the fall of 1999, the board ofdirectors of the NKF approved a proposal tomove the clinical practice guidelines initiativeinto a new phase, in which its scope would beenlarged to encompass the entire spectrum ofCKD. To reflect this expanded scope, the refer-ence to \"dialysis\" in DOQI was changed to\"disease\" and the new initiative was termedKidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI). To provide a unifying focus for this new initiative, it was decided that its centerpiecewould be a set of clinical practice guidelines ontheevaluation,classication,andstraticationof CKD, which would provide a basis for the con-tinuous care and appropriate management ofpatients throughout the course of progressivekidney disease. Work on the Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classication, and Strati-cation guidelines began in January 2000 and thenalguidelineswerepublishedinFebruary2002. 2 It was decided from the outset that interven- tional guidelines for the management of thespecic problems that affect patients with CKDwould follow and be based on the staging andclassicationdevelopedbyChronicKidneyDis-ease: Evaluation, Classication, and Stratica-tion guidelines. Three such guidelines are nowunder various stages of development. We areproud to present the rst of these interventionalguidelinesforthemanagementofdyslipidemias. Work on these guidelines began in November 2000. The Work Group appointed to developthese guidelines screened 10,363 relevant ab-stractsandselected258articlesforformalstruc-turedreviewofcontentandmethodology. As detailed in the introductory comments of theRationalefortheseGuidelines,theyaremeantto supplement the Third Report of the NationalCholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ExpertPanelonDetection,EvaluationandTreatmentofHigh Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treat-ment Panel, ATP III) published in 2001. 3Since its launch in 1985 by the National Heart, Lungand Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), NCEP has made sig-nicant strides towards its stated goal of reduc-ing the prevalence of high blood cholesterol intheUnitedStates.However,ATPIIIanditsoldercomponent in children (NCEP-C), without ex-cluding treatment of dyslipidemias in CKD. Given the recommendations of the NKF Task Force onCardiovascular Disease in Chronic Renal Dis-ease 4that patients with CKD should be consid - ered in the highest risk group for cardiovasculardisease,itwasdecidedfromtheoutsetofK/DOQIthat management of dyslipidemias in patientswith kidney disease would be one of the rst interventional guidelines that would be devel-oped.Thedifferencesofthepresentsetofguide-lines from those of theATPIII and NCEP-C aregiveninTables5and6oftheguidelines,respec-tively. On behalf of the NKF, we would like to acknowledge the considerable effort and contri-butions of all those who made these guidelinespossible. In particular, we wish to acknowledgethe following: the members of the Work Groupcharged with developing the guidelines, withoutwhosetirelesseffortandcommitmenttheseguide-lineswouldnothavebeenpossible;themembersof the Support Group, whose input at monthlyconference calls was instrumental in resolvingthe problems encountered in the course of themany months that it has taken to bring theguidelines to their present stage; the members oftheK/DOQIAdvisoryBoard,whoseinsightsandguidance were essential in re ning and expand- ingtheapplicabilityoftheguidelines;toAmgen,Inc, which had the vision and foresight to appre-ciate the merits of K/DOQI and provided theunrestricted grant support for its launching andcontinued work since 2000; to Fujisawa Health-care, Inc, which shared the K/DOQI objective toimprovethemanagementandcareofthisimpor-tant problem which affects patients with CKDand transplantation, and as the Primary Sponsorof the present set of guidelines provided theunrestricted funds necessary for their develop-ment;andtotheK/DOQIstaffinNewYork,whoworked diligently in attending to the innumer-abledetailsthatneededattentiononadailybasis,for coordinating and facilitating the work ofeveryone who has contributed to the guidelines,and in meeting the nearly impossible deadlinesthathavetobemetinaprojectsuchasthis. Aspecial debt of gratitude goes to Bertram L. Kasiske,MD,ChairoftheWorkGroup,who,theperfect gentleman that he is, in his inimitableefcient and accommodating manner made thetask for everyone who worked on these guide-lines not only easier but a pleasant experience.His leadership, intellectual rigor, and expertisewere the driving force that brought these guide-lines to fruition. Special thanks are due also toJoseph Lau, MD, Director of the Evidence Re-view Team, for providing methodological rigorand staff support in developing the evidentiarybasis of the guidelines. As the individual incharge of the review team of CKD and thepresent guidelines, as well as two other sets nowunder development, he has been the model pa-tient and effective teacher who has helped trainand graduate the members of the different WorkGroups into the experts they have become inevidentiarymedicine. Inavoluntaryandmultidisciplinaryundertak- ing of the magnitude of K/DOQI, numerousothershavemadeimportantcontributionstotheseguidelines but cannot be individually acknowl-edged here. On behalf of all the patients andproviders who will become the ultimate bene - ciaries of these guidelines, we would like ease (CVD) is very high in patients with chronickidney(CKD)disease.Indeed,available evidence for patients with Stage 5 CKD, and kidney transplant recipients, suggests that the10-year cumulative risk of coronary heart dis-ease is at least 20%, or roughly equivalent to therisk seen in patients with previous CVD. TheWorkGroupconcludedthattheNationalCholes-terol Education Program Guidelines are appli-cable to patients with Stages 1-4 CKD. There-fore, these K/DOQI guidelines target adults andadolescentswithStage5CKD,andkidneytrans-plantrecipients.Dyslipidemiasareverycommonin this population, but no randomized controlledtrials have examined the effects of dyslipidemiatreatment on CVD. Nevertheless, evidence fromthegeneralpopulationsuggeststhattreatmentofdyslipidemias reduces CVD, and evidence in patients with Stage 5 CKD suggests that judi-cious treatment can be safe and effective inimproving dyslipidemias. Therefore, guidelineswere developed to aid clinicians in the manage-ment of dyslipidemias, until the needed random-ized trials are completed. These guidelines aredividedintofoursections.Therstsection(Intro-duction) provides the rationale for the guide-lines, and describes the target population, scope,intendedusers,andmethods.Thesecondsectionpresentsguidelinesontheassessmentofdyslipi-demias (Guidelines 1-3), while the third sectionoffers guidelines for the treatment of dyslipi-demias(Guidelines4-5).Thekeyguidelinestate-ments are supported by data from studies in thegeneralpopulation,butthereisanurgentneedtoconrmthesestudyresultsinpatientswithCKD.Therefore,afourthsectionoutlinesrecommenda-tions for research. The overall strength of eachguideline statement was rated according to thetablebelow. \u00a92003bytheNationalKidneyFoundation,Inc. 0272-6386/03/4104-0302$30.00/0 AmericanJournalofKidneyDiseases, Vol41,No4,Suppl3(April),2003:pS10 S10I. INTRODUCTION THE RATIONALE FOR GUIDELINES THE NUMBER OF patients with chronic kidneydisease(CKD)isincreasing.Unfor- tunately, the survival of CKD patients remains poor.5This is, in large part, due to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) that manifests it-selfascoronaryheartdisease(CHD),cerebrovas-cular disease, and/or peripheral vascular disease(Table1).Thereare2majoroverlappingcatego-ries of CVD: (1) disorders of cardiovascularperfusion, which include atherosclerotic CVD(ACVD); and (2) disorders of cardiac function,suchasheartfailureandleftventricularhypertro-phy. Some risk factors are unique to each cat-egory of CVD, and some risk factors are sharedbybothcategoriesofCVD. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Task Force on CVD concluded that the incidence ofACVDishigherinpatientswithCKDcomparedto the general population (Fig 1). 4The Task Force concluded that patients with CKD shouldbe considered to be in the highest risk category, ie,aCHDriskequivalent,forriskfactormanage-ment. In response to recommendations of theNKF Task Force on CVD, the NKF KidneyDisease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI)convened a Work Group to develop guidelinesfor the management of dyslipidemias, one of therisk factors for CHD in CKD. The Work GrouprstmetonNovember27,2000. During the development of these guidelines, the NKF K/DOQI also completed guidelines onCKD. 2TheseCKDguidelinesdenedCKD,and reiteratedthatCKDshouldbeconsideredaCHDrisk equivalent and that risk factors should S11(1) Structural or functional abnormalities of thekidney,withorwithoutdecreasedGFR. These abnormalities are manifested byeitherpathologicalabnormalitiesormark-ers of kidney damage, including abnor-malities in the composition of blood orurine,orabnormalitiesinradiographicim- agingtests. 2(Table1). The denitions of CKD are on measured or estimated GFR (Table 2), wherethe GFR is estimated from the serum creatinineusing an established formula, as described in theK/DOQI CKD /H1135090 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with evidence of kidney damage (as de ned above). Stage 2 CKD is de ned as evidence of kidney damage with mildly decreased GFR of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2. The level of estimated GFR, with or without kidney damage, de nes Stages 3-4. Stage 5 (kidney failure) is de ned as GFR/H1102115mL/min/1.73m2,ortheclinicalindica - tionforkidneyreplacementtherapywithmainte-nancehemodialysis,peritonealdialysis,ortrans-plantation(Table2).Thus,someStage5patientsmayneedkidneyreplacementtherapybecauseofuremic symptoms, even when, based solely onGFR, they would be classied in Stage 4 (GFR 15-29mL/min/1.73m 2)(Table2). Of the traditional risk factors for ACVD in patients with CKD, dyslipidemias may play amajor role. In developing these guidelines, theWork Group was greatly aided by the NationalCholesterol Education Program Expert Panel onDetection, Evaluation, and Treatment of HighBlood Cholesterol in Adults, Adult TreatmentPanelIII(ATPIII), 3andtheNationalCholesterol ExpertPanelonChildren(NCEP-C).6Thedeni- tionsofdyslipidemiasadoptedbytheWorkGroupwere those of ATP III (Table 3). In the end, themajortaskoftheWorkGroupwastodecidehowthe ATP III and NCEP-C guidelines should beappliedtopatientswithCKD. Fig1.

INTRODUCTION S12There is evidence from observational studies that, in addition to dyslipidemias, some \"non- traditional\" riskfactorssuchascalcium,phospho- rus, and parathyroid CVD in pa- tients with CKD. However, unlike dyslipi-demias, there are no intervention trials frompatients in the general population (or in thosewith CKD) demonstrating that the modi cation ofthesenon-traditionalriskfactorsreducesCVD.Therefore, these guidelines focus on the assess-ment and treatment of dyslipidemias in patientswith CKD. Unfortunately, there are no random-ized controlled intervention trials in CKD pa-tients showing that the treatment of dyslipi-demias reduces the incidence of ACVD.Moreover,itispossiblethattrialresultsfromthegeneral population may not be applicable to allpatients with CKD. It is also possible that insomesubpopulationsofCKDpatients,treatmentof dyslipidemias may not be as safe \u2014or as effective\u2014in reducing the incidence of ACVD,asitisinthegeneralpopulation.ThismaybeduetotheuniquecomplicationsofCKD(eg,anemia,calcium and phosphorus metabolic abnormali-ties) that may contribute to the risk ofACVD inCKD.Therefore,theWorkGroupconcludedthatadditional,randomized,placebo-controlledtrialsare urgently needed in patients with CKD, andthattheuseofaplaceboisjustiedinthecontextof an appropriately designed trial, even whenlipid levels fall within the treatment thresholdsrecommended by these guidelines (see IV. Re- searchRecommendations ). TARGET POPULATION Oneofthe rsttasksoftheWorkGroupwasto denethetargetpopulationforguidelinesonthemanagement of dyslipidemia. It decided toincludeallpatientswithStage5CKD,aswellaskidney transplant recipients, irrespective ofwhetherkidneytransplantrecipientswereclassi-ed as having CKD according to the K/DOQICKD Guidelines. Some kidney transplant pa- INTRODUCTION S13tients who have normal kidney function (GFR /H1135090 mL/min/1.73 m2) CKD, because they do not have evidence ofkidney damage, ie, they may have normal urineprotein excretion, urine sediment, histology, andradiographicimaging.However,theCKDguide-lines consider such patients at increased risk forCKD.As such, the Work Group decided to con-sider that all kidney transplant recipients haveCKD, or are at increased risk for CKD, and toinclude kidney transplant recipients in the targetpopulation. TheWorkGroupconsideredwhethertheguide- lines should include patients with Stages 1-4CKD (GFR /H1135015 mL/min/1.73 m 2). These pa - tients have a very high prevalence of dyslipi-demiasandACVD, 22-25anditwasconcludedthat the recently updated guidelines of the ATP III3 weregenerallyapplicabletopatientswithStages1-4CKD.Specically,itwasconcludedthatitisunlikelythattherecommendationsoftheATPIIIwould need to be modied for patients with Stages1-4CKD,exceptto: (1) ClassifyCKDasaCHDriskequivalent;(2) Consider complications of lipid-lowering therapies that may result from reducedkidneyfunction; (3) Consider whether there might be indica- tions for the treatment of dyslipidemiasotherthanpreventingACVD;and (4) Determine whether the treatment of pro- teinuria might also be an effective treat-mentfordyslipidemias. Classication of CKD as a CHD 2,4Therefore, for Stage 1-4 CKD patients,theWorkGroupfocuseditsattentiononthe latter three issues, and otherwise recom-mended that theATP III Guidelines be followedinallpatientswithStages1-4CKD. Finally, the Work Group considered whether toincludechildrenandadolescentsintheseguide-lines (Fig 2). Although the ATP III covers onlyindividuals /H1135020 years of age, 3it was concluded that CKD individuals 18-20 should also be in-cluded and considered as adults. Much haschanged in the decade since the report of theNCEP-C. 6However, there are still very fewstudies of dyslipidemias in children and adoles-cents, either in the general population or inpersons with CKD. In the end, it was concludedthat adolescents (de ned by the onset of pu- berty), in any stage of CKD or with a kidneytransplant, should be included in these guide-lines. Children (before the onset of puberty)should be managed according to existing guide-lines,suchastheNCEP-C. 6 SCOPE The Work Group also considered the recom- mendations of the NKF Task Force on CVDconcerning the management of risk factors otherthan dyslipidemias. 4There are 2 potential rea - sonstoassessotherriskfactorsforACVD:(1)tocategorizeoverallriskforthepurposeofmakingdecisionsregardingthemanagementofdyslipide-mia; and (2) to identify modi able risk factors other than dyslipidemia that should also betreated.The rstreasonwasconsideredunneces- sary (for the purpose of these guidelines) byacceptingtherecommendationthatapatientwithCKD should be considered to have a CHD riskequivalent when deciding the appropriate man-agement of dyslipidemia. However, the WorkGroup acknowledged that other risk factors arealsoimportantinthepathogenesisofACVDandshould be treated. Therefore, the Work GroupconcludedthatforpatientswithCKD: Dyslipidemiamanagementshouldbeunder- takeninconjunctionwithallotheravailablemeasures to reduce the overall risk ofACVD. Modiable, risk factors (in- cluding hypertension, cigarette smoking,glucoseintoleranceordiabetescontrol,andobesity)shouldbeassessedatinitialpresen-tationandatleastyearlythereafter. Fig2.

The ATP III also notes that various dyslipidemias havebeen reported in persons with kidney failure.However, the ATP III suggests that a cautiousapproachbetaken,sincethesepersonsarepronetodrugside-effects,eg,theyareatincreasedriskfor myopathy from both brates and statins. In fact, the ATP III suggests that chronic kidneyfailureisacontraindicationto brates. The Work Group concluded that, in most ar- eas, theATPIII and NCEP-C were applicable toadults and adolescents, respectively. It consid-ered its principal task to dene areas where the ATP III and NCEP-C needed modi cation and renement for patients with CKD. In the end,relativelyfewmodicationswereneeded(Tables5and6). INTENDED USERS These guidelines are intended for use by phy- sicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists,dietitians, and other health-care professionalswho care for patients with CKD. The informa-tioncontainedintheseguidelinescanandshouldbe conveyed to patients and their families in anunderstandablemannerbytheirphysicianand/or INTRODUCTION S15INTRODUCTION S16other health-care professionals. The develop- ment of educational support materials designedspecicallyforpatientsandtheirfamiliesshould be part of the implementation of these guide-lines. ANTICIPATED UPDATES All guidelines should be updated whenever new, pertinent information becomes available.To anticipate when these guidelines may need tobe updated, the Work Group discussed ongoingclinical trials in the general population and inpatients with CKD, as those results may bepertinent to some recommendations. Late in thecourse of development of these guidelines, theresults of the Heart Protection Study were pub-lished. 34This study randomly allocated 20,536 adults with coronary artery disease to simvasta-tin 40 mg versus matching placebo. Patientstreatedwithsimvastatinhadan18%reductionincoronary deaths. Importantly, the reduction inmortality was seen irrespective of the baselinelevel of cholesterol. This raised the possibilitythat all patients with known coronary arterydiseaseshouldbetreatedwithastatin,regardlessof the serum cholesterol level. Ultimately, theseand other results from ongoing trials could con-ceivably change the recommended approach totreatment of dyslipidemias. Some other impor-tant ongoing trials in patients from the generalpopulationinclude: \u2014AntihypertensiveandLipidLoweringTreatment toPreventHeartAttackTrial(ALLHAT) 35 \u2014Study Evaluating Additional Decrease in Through Evaluation and Diabetes Study (CARDS)38;42 \u2014Atorvastatin as Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP)study Thus, a number of potentially important trials will be completed within the next 3-5 years. Giventhepotentialfortheseandotherstudiestoprovide information pertinent to the assessmentand treatment of dyslipidemias in patients withCKD, it was concluded that these guidelinesshouldbeupdatedinabout3yearsfromthetimeofpublication,andsoonerifnew,pertinentinfor-mationbecomesavailablebeforethen.TheWorkGroup will monitor the progress of these trialsand recommend updating these guidelines asindicated. METHODS Guideline Development These guidelines were developed using 4 ba- sicprinciplessetforthbytheK/DOQI: (1) The guidelines were developed using a scientically rigorous process, and the ra-tionale and evidentiary basis for eachguidelineisclearlyexplained. (2) AmultidisciplinaryWorkGroup,withex- pertise in the management of CKD, dys-lipidemias, and ACVD developed theguidelines. (3) The Work Group using an evi- dence-based approach similar to that endorsedby the Agency for Health-Care Research andINTRODUCTION S17Quality.TheWork Group reviewed all pertinent, published evidence, and critically appraised thequality of studies and the overall strength ofevidencesupportingeachrecommendation. RatingtheStrengthofGuidelinesandEvidence The overall strength of each guideline state- ment was rated by assigning either \"A,\"\"B,\"or \"C\"(Table 7). An \"A\"rating indicates \"it is strongly recommended that clinicians routinely follow the guideline for eligible patients. Thereis strong evidence that the practice improves nethealth outcomes, and bene ts substantially out- weigh harms.\" There were no guidelines that were assigned an \"A\"level recommendation. The\"B\"ratingindicates \"itisrecommendedthatclinicians routinely follow the guideline for eli- gible patients. There is moderate evidence thatthe practice improves net health outcomes. \"A \"C\"rating indicates \"it is recommended that clinicians consider following the guideline foreligible patients. This recommendation is basedoneitherweakevidence,poorevidenceorontheopinions of the Work Group and reviewers, thatthe practice might improve net health out-comes.\" Thestrengthofevidencewasassessedusinga ratingsystemthattakesintoaccount(1)method-ologicalqualityofthestudies;(2)whetherornotthestudywascarriedoutinthetargetpopulation,ie, patients with CKD, or in other populations; INTRODUCTION S18and (3) whether the studies examined health outcomes directly, or examined surrogate mea-sures for those outcomes, eg, improving dyslipi-demiaratherthanreducingCVD(Table8).These3 separate study characteristics were combinedin rating the strength of evidence provided bypertinentstudies. LiteratureRetrievalandReview The Work Group collaborated with a profes- sional Evidence Review Team to identify and summarize pertinent literature (seeAppendix 1).TheWorkGroupandtheEvidenceReviewTeamrst identied the topics to be searched, and theEvidence Review Team conducted the literaturesearch. The topics that were selected for searchincluded the incidence or prevalence of dyslipi-demia, the association of dyslipidemia withACVD, and the treatment of dyslipidemia inpatients with Stage 5 CKD (including kidneytransplant recipients). For patients with Stages1-4 CKD, topics for the literature retrieval werelimited to adverse effects of dyslipidemia treat-ment, the effects of dyslipidemia treatment onkidney disease progression, and the effects oftherapies that reduce proteinuria on dyslipi-demias. Systematic searches for all studies ondyslipidemiaprevalence,associationwithACVD,and treatment for patients with Stages 1-4 CKDwere not conducted. As described above, theWork Group concluded a priori that the ATP IIIGuidelines were generally applicable to patientswithStages1-4CKD. Briefly,theliteraturesearchincludedonlyfull, peer-reviewed, journal articles of original data.Review articles, editorials, letters, case studies,andabstractswereexcluded.Studieswereidenti-ed primarily through MEDLINE searches ofthe English language literature up to May 2001.

Separate search strategies were developed for eachtopic.ThetextwordsorMeSHheadingsforall topics included kidney or kidney diseases,hemodialysis,peritonealdialysis,orkidneytrans-plant. The searches were limited to human stud-ies,butincludedbothadultandpediatricpopula-tions. Potential articles for retrieval wereidentiedfromprintedabstractsandtitles,basedon study population, relevance to the topic, andarticle type. These were screened by clinicianson the Evidence Review Team. Overall, 10,363abstracts were screened, 642 articles were re-trieved, and 258 articles were subjected to struc-tured review by members of the Work Group.Although systematic, manual searches were notconducted,membersoftheWorkGroupsupplieda number of articles that were not located by theMEDLINEsearches. Work Group members used forms that were developed by the Evidence Review Team toextract information from each article that wasreviewed. The Evidence Review Team used theinformation from these forms to construct theEvidence Tables. The Evidence Review Teamthen used the Evidence Tables to construct theSummaryTablesthatareincludedwiththeguide-lines in this report. The Summary Tables de-scribe the information in the Evidence Tablesaccordingto4studydimensions:size,applicabil-ity,results,andmethodologicalquality. Thestudy(sample)sizewasusedasameasure of the weight of the evidence. In general, largestudies provide more precise estimates of preva-lence and associations. Applicability (generaliz-abilityorexternalvalidity)addressestheissueofwhetherthestudypopulationissuf cientlybroad INTRODUCTION S20so that the results can be generalized to the population of interest. The applicability of eacharticle was determined using a three-level scale: (1) the study sample is representative of the targetpopulation; (2) the sample is representative of a relevant subgroup;or (3) the sample is representative of a narrow subgroupofpatients. Methodological quality (internal validity) re- fers to the design, conduct, and reporting of theclinical study. Because studies with a variety ofdesigns were evaluated, a broad classi cation system to rate the quality of individual studieswasused: (a) least bias, most valid, ie, a study that meets most generally accepted criteria forhighquality; (b) susceptibletosomebias,butnotsuf cient toinvalidatetheresults;and (c) signicant bias that may invalidate the results. GUIDELINES, EVIDENCE, AND RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS There were no guidelines that were assigned an\"A\"levelrecommendation.Thekeyguideline statements in this document were graded \"B\"or \"C.\"Some would argue that no guideline state- mentsshouldbemadeintheabsenceofevidencefrom randomized trials in patients with CKD(yielding level \"A\"recommendations). How- ever, it was decided that when the strength ofevidence for treatment ef cacy was strong\u2014 based on trials in the general population \u2014this evidence might be reasonably extrapolated topatients with CKD (Fig 3). Speci cally, it was assumed that similar treatment ef cacy as re-ported in the general population would be foundif the trials were carried out in patients withCKD. This also assumes, of course, that treat-mentissafeandeffectiveinamelioratingdyslipi-demiasinpatientswithCKD. Theprincipalresultsoflargemulticentertrials in the general population have generally beenapplicabletomost,ifnotall,majorsubgroupsofpatients that have been examined (Fig 4).

There-fore, it was reasonable to assume that the majorndings from randomized trials in the generalpopulation are applicable to patients with CKD,untilprovenotherwise. Nevertheless,therearereasonabledoubtsasto whether trial results from the general populationcanbeextrapolatedtoallpatientswithCKD,andmost major trials in the general population haveexcludedpatientswithelevatedserumcreatinineandStage5CKD(Table9).Itispossiblethat,insome subpopulations of CKD patients, dyslipi-demias may not play as large a role in thepathogenesis of CVD as they do in the generalpopulation. Therefore, it was concluded that ad-ditional studies are needed in patients with CKD(seeIV. Research Recommendations ). However, pendingtheresultsofthesetrials,therecommen-dations were based on the evidence from thegeneralpopulation. INTRODUCTION S21II.ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS IN EACH OF the following guideline state- ments, kidney transplant recipients are in- cluded along with other patients with CKD, whetherornottheyhaveotherevidenceofCKD.Each guideline statement is followed by a lettergrade (in parentheses) indicating the strength oftherecommendation(Table7). GUIDELINE 1 1.1. AlladultsandadolescentswithCKDshould beevaluatedfordyslipidemias.(B) 1.2. For adults and adolescents with CKD, the assessment of dyslipidemias should include a complete fasting lipid prole with totalcholesterol,LDL,HDL,andtriglycerides.(B) 1.3. ForadultsandadolescentswithStage5CKD, dyslipidemias should be evaluated upon pre-sentation (when the patient is stable), at 2-3months after a change in treatment or otherconditions known to cause dyslipidemias;andatleastannuallythereafter.(B) AssociationsBetweenDyslipidemiasandACVD inCKD The incidence of ACVD is very high in pa- tients with CKD (Fig 5). Therefore, the NKFTask Force on CVD and the K/DOQI WorkGroup on CKD both concluded that, in the man-agement of risk factors such as dyslipidemia,patientswithCKDshouldbeconsideredtobeinthehighestriskcategory,ie,equivalenttothatofpatientswithknownCHD. 2,4Thereisverystrong evidencefromthegeneralpopulationthatdyslipi-demias cause ACVD, and this evidence has ledto the ATP III guidelines for evaluation andtreatment. 3It is conceivable that the pathogene- sis of ACVD is different in patients with CKD,andthatdyslipidemiasdonotcontributetoACVDinCKD.However,therelationshipbetweendys-lipidemias andACVD in the general populationis robust, ie, it is valid in men and women 3,46,47; old and middle-aged3,46,47; smokers and non- smokers3,47; nondiabetics3,48; and in- dividualswithhigherorlowerLDL,3,47higherorlowertotalcholesterol,3,47higherorlowertriglyc- erides,3,47andhigherorlowerHDL(Fig4).3,47,49,50 There are no compelling reasons to assume thatdyslipidemias do not contribute to ACVD inpatientswithCKDaswell. Therearenorandomized,controlled,interven- tion trials testing the hypothesis that dyslipi-demiascauseACVDinpatientswithCKD.How-ever, in an observational study of 3,716 patientsinitiatingtreatmentforStage5CKDin1996,theuse of statins in 362 (9.7%) was independentlyassociated with all-cause mortality and areduction in CVD deaths during follow-up. 84 Unfortunately, it is likely that the patients usingstatins had other favorable characteristics thatwere not accounted for in the adjusted analysis,but may have explained their reduced risk forCVD independent of their use of statins. There-fore, these study results are consistent with, butdo not prove, the hypothesis that dyslipidemiascontributetoACVDinpatientswithCKD. AssociationsBetweenDyslipidemiasandACVD inHemodialysisPatients There are no large, prospective, observational studies examining the relationship betweenACVD and dyslipidemias in to nd a positiveassociation between dyslipidemias and ACVD.None of these studies was a long-term, prospec-tive, cohort study, and it is likely that illness,inflammation,andpoornutritionconfoundedtherelationshipsbetweendyslipidemiasandACVD.Support for this notion comes from studies thathave found that at least some of the seeminglyparadoxical associations between dyslipidemiasand ACVD are, in part, explained by statisticaladjustment for markers of malnutrition and sys-temicinflammation. 85-87 More than a decade ago, it was reported that the association between cholesterol and mortal-ity(muchofwhichwaspresumablyduetoCVD)in hemodialysis patients took the form of aU-shaped curve. 85,86Moreover, the association between low cholesterol and increased mortality\u00a92003bytheNationalKidneyFoundation,Inc. 0272-6386/03/4104-0304$30.00/0 AmericanJournalofKidneyDiseases, Vol41,No4,Suppl3(April),2003:ppS22-S38 S22was reduced after adjusting for levels of serum albumin.85,86Similarly, in a recent prospective study of 1,167 hemodialysis patients, low serumcholesterol levels were associated with all-causemortality in patients with low serum albumin. 87 However, in patients with normal serum albu-min, the opposite was true; high serum choles-terol predicted mortality. 87C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, has been associatedwith lower serum cholesterol levels. 87Other markers of inflammation, eg, interleukin-6 andtumor necrosis factor- /H9251, are also associated with Fig 5. Causes of death among period prevalent patients 1997-1999, treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal demonstrate a seem- ingly paradoxical association between low se-rumcholesterolandincreasedmortalityinhemo-dialysis patients. They should not be interpretedto mean that dyslipidemias do not contribute tothe pathogenesis of ACVD. Rather, it is morelikely that the opposite is true, ie, that highcholesterol contributes to ACVD in hemodialy-sis patients as it does in the general population,andthatotherconditionsaccompanyinglowcho-lesterol (such as inflammation) account for the increased mortality of patients with low choles-terol. Non-TraditionalLipidAbnormalitiesandACVD inHemodialysisPatients Several observational studies have reported a positive association between lipoprotein(a)[Lp(a)] and ACVD to be associatedwith ACVD in 440 hemodialysis patients. 90In contrast, a small study (n /H1100575) of peritoneal dialysis patients99and a small study (n /H1100579) of transplant patients both failed to nd an associa- tion between Lp(a) and Lp(a) in CKD pa-tients as well, 100,101there are no studies in pa - tients with CKD, or in the general population,examining the effect of reducing Lp(a) on CVD.Thus, it is difcult to recommend routine mea- surementofLp(a)inclinicalpractice. It is also possible that other, non-traditional, atherogeniclipoproteinabnormalitiesmaycauseor contribute toACVD in hemodialysis patients.For example, all,106case control studies examining oxidized lipoproteinsin hemodialysis patients have reported higherlevels compared to matched controls. In addi-tion, a randomized, controlled trial found thatsupplementation with vitamin recur-rent ACVD events in 196 hemodialysis patients(P/H110050.014). 107However, this trial was small, and much larger trials in the general populationhave failed to show benet from vitamin E supplementation. 108-115Evidence from observational studies in the generalpopulationhassuggestedthatlipoprotein remnantsmaycontributetoACVD,especiallyinpatients with high triglycerides. 3There are also cross-sectionalstudiesreportingthathemodialy-sispatientshavehigherlevelsofremnantlipopro-teins,eg,triglyceride-enrichedlipoproteinsand/orsmalldenseLDL,comparedtocontrols. 104,116-123 However, none of these studies reported correla-tionsbetweenlevelsofremnantlipoproteinswithACVD, and the signicance of these abnormali- tiesisunknown. AssociationsBetweenDyslipidemiasandACVD inPeritonealDialysisPatients Only 2 studies that examined the relationship between dyslipidemias and ACVD in peritoneal dialysis patients were identi ed (Table 11). Both ofthesestudieshadmajordesignlimitations,andboth were too small to rigorously examine therelationship between dyslipidemias and ACVDintheperitonealdialysispatientpopulation. AssociationsBetweenDyslipidemiasandACVD inKidneyTransplantRecipients Several studies have reported a positive as- sociation between total cholesterol andACVDin kidney transplant recipients (Table 12). Un-fortunately, few of these studies examined therelationship between LDL and ACVD. Lowerlevels of HDL were associated with ACVD in3of4studies.In3of6studies,higherlevelsoftriglycerides with ACVD. Al-togetherthesestudiessuggestthattherelation-ship betweenACVD and dyslipidemias in kid-ney transplant recipients is similar to thatobserved in the general population. However,eachofthesestudieshaddesignlimitations;inparticular, none was truly prospective. Kidneytransplant recipients may also have non-traditionallipoproteinabnormalitiesthatcouldtheoretically contribute to ACVD. 125-127How- ever, the role of these pathogenesis of ACVD in CKD, asinthegeneralpopulation,isunclear. TheEvaluationofDyslipidemiasinCKD Measurements of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides are readily available in most majorASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S24clinical laboratories. The LDL that forms the foundation for treatment decisions in theATPIIIGuidelines 3is generally calculated from total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides using theFriedewaldformula.TheATPIIIGuidelinesalsorecommendtreatmentofsomedyslipidemiasthatmay occur with normal or low LDL. Thesedyslipidemias\u2014often seen in association withthe metabolic, or insulin resistance syndrome(the syndrome of obesity, hypertension, insulinresistance, and hyperlipidemia) and character-ized by increases in circulating lipoprotein rem-nants\u2014can be most readily measured as non-HDLcholesterol,ie,totalcholesterolminusHDL(Fig 6). 3All of the major treatment decisions for dyslipidemia in these guidelines, as in the ATPIII Guidelines, are based on levels of triglycer-ides,LDL,andnon-HDLcholesterol. ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S25AssociationsBetweenDyslipidemiasand KidneyDiseaseProgression Theprincipalreasontoevaluatedyslipidemias in patients with CKD is to detect abnormalitiesthat may be treated to reduce the incidence ofACVD. However, there may be other reasons toevaluateandtreatdyslipidemiasinCKD.Anum-ber of observational studies have reported thatvarious dyslipidemias are associated with de-creased kidney function in the general popula-tion and in patients with CKD (Table 13). It isimpossible to determine from these studieswhether dyslipidemias cause reduced kidneyfunction,resultfromreducedkidneyfunction,orwhetherotherconditionssuchasproteinuriacausebothreducedkidneyfunctionanddyslipidemias.Eachoftheseexplanationsisplausible,andonlyrandomized, controlled trials can adequately testthehypothesisthatdyslipidemiascauseadeclineinkidneyfunction. Unfortunately, there are no large, adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials testingthe hypothesis that treatment of dyslipidemiapreserves kidney function. However, there havebeen several small studies, 137-148and a meta- analysis of these studies.149This meta-analysis included prospective, controlled trials publishedbefore July 1, 1999. Three trials published onlyin abstract form were included in this meta-analysis 137,138,148; one of these studies has subse - quently been published in a peer-reviewed jour-nal. 148All patients were followed for at least 3 months, but in only 5 studies were patientsfollowed for at least 1 year. Statins were used in10 studies, gembrozil in 1 study, and probucol in 1 study. Altogether, 362 patients with CKDwere included in the meta-analysis. The resultssuggested that the decline in GFR terol-loweringagentcomparedtoplacebo. 149No signicant heterogeneity in treatment effect was detectedbetweenthestudies.However,thequal-ity of the studies was generally low, and theirsmall sample sizes and relatively short durationof follow-up make it dif cult to conclude that lipid-lowering therapies reduce the rate of de-cline in GFR in CKD. Therefore, the primary orsecondarypreventionofACVDremainstheprin-cipal reason to evaluate and treat dyslipidemiasinpatientswithCKD. ThePrevalenceofDyslipidemiasin HemodialysisPatients The prevalence of dyslipidemias in patients with CKD is high (Tables 14, 15, 16, and 17).Dyslipidemias in hemodialysis patients are mostoften characterized by normal LDL, low HDL,andhightriglycerides.Fromthepublishedlitera-ture, it is difcult to discern the prevalence ofdyslipidemiainhemodialysispatients,sincemoststudies are relatively small and use varying de - nitions for dyslipidemia. Therefore, the WorkGroup examined the prevalence of dyslipidemiain a large cross-section of 1,047 hemodialysispatients in the Dialysis Morbidity and MortalityStudy (Table 16). The de nitions of the ATP III Guidelines, as well as those adopted in theseguidelines, were used. According to ATP IIIdenitions, only 20.2% of hemodialysis patientshad normal the de nitions of the present guidelines, 61.1% would require treatment of a Fig6.

Although both patients AandBhavethesametotalandHDLcholesterollevels,for patient A with normal triglycerides, most of thenon-HDL cholesterol is LDL. However, for Patient Bwith high triglycerides, much of the non-HDL choles-terolisVLDLandIDLremnants.Unitsareinmg/dL.Toconvert mg/dL to mmol/L, multiply triglycerides (/H113502.59 mmol/L), while another 5.4% with choles-terol/H11350130mg/dL(/H113503.36mmol/L)(Table16). ThePrevalenceofDyslipidemiasinPeritonealDialysisPatients The prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis is high, and dif-ferssomewhatfromthatinhemodialysispatients(Tables 14, 15, 16, and 17). In a cross-section of317peritonealdialysispatientsfromtheDialysisMorbidity and Mortality Study (Table 17), only15.1% had normal lipid levels according to theATPIIIGuidelines,ie,LDL /H11021130mg/dL(/H11021 denitions of the present guidelines, 78.6% would require treatment of a dyslipide-mia; 73.2% would require treatment based onLDL/H11350100 mg/dL (/H113502.59 mmol/L), while an- other 5.4% with on triglycerides (/H113502.26mmol/L)andnon-HDLcholesterol /H11350130 mg/dL(/H113503.36mmol/L)(Table17). ThePrevalenceofDyslipidemiasinKidneyTransplantRecipients The prevalence of dyslipidemias in kidney transplant recipients is very high (Table 14 andTable 15). Particularly common are increases intotal cholesterol and LDL. Triglycerides are of-tenincreased,butHDLisusuallynormal. TheFrequencyofDyslipidemiaEvaluationin CKD Many factors influence the prevalence of dys- lipidemiasinCKD.Changesinproteinuria,GFR,and treatment of CKD may alter lipoproteinlevels.Therefore,itisprudenttoevaluatedyslipi-demias more often than is recommended in thegeneral population. Lipoprotein levels maychangeduringthe rst3monthsofhemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation.On the other hand, waiting 3 months to measuretherst lipid prole may needlessly delay effec- tive treatment for patients who present withdyslipidemia. For patients whose lipid pro le is normal at presentation, it is reasonable to repeat ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S29ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S30ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S31the lipid prole 3 months later, to con rm that the initial values were not low due to malnutri- tion or systemic disease. During the course ofkidneydiseasetreatment,lipidlevelsmaychange.Therefore,theWorkGrouprecommendsmeasur-ing subsequent levels at least annually. Reasonsto repeat lipid measurements after 2-3 monthsinclude changes in kidney replacement therapymodality, treatment with diet or lipid-loweringagents,immunosuppressiveagentsthataffectlipids(eg,prednisone,cyclosporine,orsirolimus)orotherchangesthatmayaffectplasmalipids. ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S32DyslipidemiasinAdolescents Young adults (20-40 years old) with Stage 5 CKDhaveatleasta10-foldhigherriskforCVD mortality compared to the general population.184 TherearelimiteddataonACVDinchildrenwithCKD. However, CVD accounts for approxi-mately23%ofdeathsinchildrenandadults /H1102130 years old who started treatment for stage 5 CKDaschildren. 185RecentdatafromthePathobiologi - cal Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth(PDAY) study provide compelling evidence inthe general pediatric population, that initial fattystreaks seen in adolescents develop into athero-matous plaques in young adults. 186Moreover, this atherosclerotic process is believed to beaccelerated in uremia, thus putting children withStage5CKDathighriskfordevelopingACVD.Indeed, studies of arteries from children withStage 5 CKD have demonstrated early ACVDchanges. 187,188 It is important to note that lipid levels in the general population change with age and puberty,and differ by gender (Tables 18, 19, 20, and21). From ages 1-12, lipid levels remain fairly constant, and are slightly lower in girls thanboys. During puberty, there is a decrease in totalcholesterol, LDL, and a slight decrease in HDLin boys.After puberty, ie, by age 17, cholesterol and LDL increase to adult levels in boys andgirls. Boys continue to have a slightly lowerHDL than girls. These changes dictate that thedenitions of dyslipidemias be different in chil-dren and adults.These guidelines de ne dyslipi- demias for children using lipid levels greaterthanthe95 thpercentileforageandgender(Tables 18, 19, 20, and 21). Treatment thresholds forchildren do not differ by age and gender, butthesethresholdsaredifferentfromthoseofadults. There are few data documenting the preva- lence of dyslipidemias in children and adoles-cents with CKD. A search was conducted forstudiespublishedafter1980thatincludedatleast15 patients and reported data on the prevalenceofdyslipidemiainunselectedpatientswithCKD.There were no studies of hemodialysis patients.Children and adolescents on peritoneal dialysisappeared to have a very high prevalence ofdyslipidemias(Table15).Indeed,29%to87%ofpediatric peritoneal had LDL/H11022100mg/dL(/H110222.59mmol/L).Similarly,72%to ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S3384%ofpediatrickidneytransplantrecipientshad LDL/H11022100 mg/dL (/H110222.59 mmol/L) (Table 15). In longitudinal study of pediatric transplantpatients, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemiadeclined from 70.4% to 35% at years, with adecrease in hypertriglyceridemia from 46.3% to15%. 182This decline in prevalence may re flect reductions in immunosuppressive medicationsandimprovedkidneyfunction.Unfortunately,nolongitudinal studies have de ned the long-term riskofdyslipidemiasinchildrenwithCKD,particu-larlyastheysurviveintoyoungadulthood. UseoftheFriedewaldFormulatoCalculate LDL The Friedewald formula appears to be the most practical, reliable method for determiningLDLcholesterolinclinicalpractice: recent studies found the Friedewald for- mula to be reliable in dialysis patients,192,193 although other investigators reported that the percentage error for the formula is higher inpatientswithCKDcomparedtothegeneralpopu-lation. 194Nostudieshaveexaminedtheaccuracy of the Friedewald formula in transplant recipi-ents, or studies in other CKD patients, eg, thosewithnephroticsyndrome. Recent data from a study in the general popu- lation suggest that the Friedewald formula mayunderestimate LDL in patients with low LDLlevels. 31Data from the general population also suggest that the Friedewald formula is not accu-rate when triglycerides are /H11350400 mg/dL(/H113504.52 mmol/L).DirectmeasurementofLDLwithultra-centrifugation or immunoprecipitation tech-niques is reasonably accurate when triglyceridesare400-800mg/dL(4.52-9.03mmol/L),butthereare no reliable techniques determining LDLwhen triglycerides indicate the presenceofhyperchylomicronemia,andtheroleofhyper-chylomicronemiainACVDisunknown. There are few studies in children, and none included children with CKD. However, in 1study of children from the general population,calculating LDL using the Friedewald formulawas more reliable in correctly classifying pa-tientswithhighLDLthanwasthedirectmeasure-mentofLDL. 195 DyslipidemiasinAcuteMedicalConditions Some acute medical conditions may tran- siently alter plasma lipid levels (Table 22). Forexample, severe infections, surgery and acutemyocardial infarction are often associated withlower-than-normallipidlevels.Otherconditions,for example acute pancreatitis, may be associ-ated with higher levels. In general, it is best towait until acute conditions that may alter lipidlevels have resolved before assessing dyslipi-demias for possible ACVD risk. It should benoted,however,thatthelipidpro leisnotsigni - cantly altered within the rst 24 hours after a myocardial infarction, and a lipid pro le theseveralpotentialremediablecausesofdyslipi-demias in patients with CKD and after kidneytransplantation (Table 23). It is not clear howsoon these agents exert their effects on lipopro-tein metabolism, and when lipid levels reach anewsteadystate.However,theeffectsofdietandlipid-lowering agents may not be fully manifestfor 2-3 months, and\u2014by analogy\u2014it may be best to measure a lipid prole 2-3 months after startingorstoppinganimmunosuppressiveagentthat is known to have a major effect on lipopro-teinlevels,eg,prednisone,cyclosporine,orsiroli-mus. The present guidelines are consistent with thoseoftheAmericanSocietyofTransplantation(AST), which recommend that a lipid pro le should be measured during the rst 6 months post-transplant, at 1 year after transplantation,and annually thereafter. 209The AST guidelines also suggest that changes in immunosuppressivetherapy, graft function, or CVD risk warrantadditionaltesting. 209 GUIDELINE 2 2.1. For adults and adolescents with Stage 5 CKD, a complete lipid pro le should be measured after an overnight fast when-everpossible.(B) 2.2. Hemodialysis patients should have lipid proles measured either before dialysis, orondaysnotreceivingdialysis.(B)Fasting Eating raises plasma triglycerides, carried mostly in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and, as a result, totalcholesterol levels also increase. The post-prandial increases in triglycerides and choles-terol are quite variable, depending on the typeof food ingested. In addition, substantial vari-ability in post-prandial lipid levels is attribut-able to inherited and acquired differences be-tween individuals. Although these differencesaffect the risk for ACVD, the relationshipbetween post-prandial lipid levels and ACVDis not as well established as the relationship between fasting lipid levels andACVD. 3Prac- ticalconsiderationsmaymakenon-fastingmea-surements the only alternative for some pa-tients.Whilefastinglipidpro lesarebest,itis better to obtain non-fasting lipid pro les than to forgo evaluation altogether. If the lipidprole obtained in a non-fasting patient is normal, then no further assessment is neededat that time. However, an abnormal lipid pro-le in a non-fasting patient is an indication to obtainafastinglipidpro le. EffectsofHemodialysisandPeritonealDialysisonPlasmaLipids There is some evidence that the hemodialysis procedure acutely alters plasma lipid levels. 217 This may be due to hemoconcentration and/oreffects of the dialysis membrane or heparin onlipoprotein metabolism. Therefore, assessmentshould be done prior to the hemodialysis proce-dure.There are few data describing how quickly ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S36ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S37lipoprotein levels change during the course of peritoneal dialysis exchanges. However, it isprobably most practical to draw blood in themorning, after an overnight fast (whenever pos-sible),andwithwhateverperitonealdialysis fluid is dwelling in the peritoneal cavity when thebloodisdrawn. GUIDELINE 3 Stage 5 CKD patients with dyslipidemias should be evaluated for remediable, second-arycauses.(B) Rationale Causes secondarycauseswithhistory,physicalexamina-tion,andappropriatelaboratorytestingisrecom-mended for any patient with dyslipidemia, sinceeffective correction of these disorders may im-provethelipidprole. Urine protein excretion, especially if /H110223g per 24 hours, can also cause or contribute todyslipidemias. 218-223Therefore, CKD patients who still produce urine should have proteinexcretion measured, if this has not been donerecently.Insomecases,theunderlyingcause(s)of the proteinuria can be treated and effec-tively reversed. In cases, angiotensin IIconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin IIreceptor blockers may help reduce protein ex-cretion, and may thereby improve the lipidprole in some patients. Clinical hypothyroid- ism can cause dyslipidemia, 224-226and even subclinical hypothyroidism may tomsofhypothyroidismmayresemblethoseofuremia,whichmaymaketheclinicaldiagnosisofhypothyroidismmoredif 227-229Therefore, patients with dyslipide - mia and CKD (but without known diabetes)should be assessed with fasting blood glucoseand possibly glycosylated hemoglobin. Glyce-miccontrolcanimprovelipidpro les. Secondary causes of dyslipidemia in children and adolescents, in addition to those listed inTable 24, include ASSESSMENTOFDYSLIPIDEMIAS S38III.TREATING THEAPPROACHadoptedforadults(Guide- line 4) Fig7andTable25.Fortherareadultpatientwith markedly elevated serum triglyceride levels, tri-glyceride reduction is the principal focus oftreatment in order to prevent pancreatitis. Other-wise, high levels of LDL are the focus of treat-ment.PatientswithnormalLDL,buthightriglyc-erides, frequently have high levels of remnantlipoproteins. In general, the level of non-HDLcholesterol can be used as a surrogate for in-creasedremnantlipoproteins,andelevatedlevelsofnon-HDLcholesterolshouldbeconsideredfortreatment. 3Non-HDLcholesterolisthetotalcho- lesterolminusHDLcholesterol(Fig6). Theapproachadoptedforadolescents(Guide- line5)issimilartothatforadults,butuseshigherthresholdsfortreatingLDLandnon-HDLcholes-terol (Fig 8). These higher thresholds are indeference to the relative lack of evidence forsafety and efcacy of treatment in adolescents,and the likelihood that the benet-to-risk ratio ishigher at higher levels of LDL and non-HDLcholesterol. TREATMENT OF ADULTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIAS GUIDELINE 4 4.1. Foradults with Stage 5 CKD and fasting triglycerides >500 mg/dL(> 5.65 mmol/L) that cannot be corrected by removing anunderlying cause, treatment with thera-peutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and a tri-glyceride-lowering agent should be con-sidered.(C) 4.2. For adults with Stage 5 CKD and LDL >100 mg/dL (>2.59 mmol/L), treatment should be considered to reduce LDL to<100mg/dL(<2.59mmol/L).(B) 4.3. For adults with Stage 5 CKD and LDL glycerides >200 approach treating adopted by theATPIII (Fig 7 andTable 25). Forrare patients with very high triglycerides, treat-ment of hypertriglyceridemia to reduce the riskfor pancreatitis takes precedence over treatmentof LDLcholesterol.TheATPIII guidelines fasting triglycerides as /H11350500 mg/dL(/H113505.65mmol/L). 3Veryhightriglycerides areunusualandaregenerallyduetoaninheritedabnormalityinlipoproteinmetabolism.Forindi-viduals with very high triglycerides, the initialaim of therapy is to prevent acute pancreatitisthroughtriglyceridelowering.Onlywhentriglyc-erides are /H11021500 mg/dL (/H110215.65 mmol/L) should attention be focused on LDL cholesterol reduc-tion. Rarely, severe hypertriglyceridemia can cause pancreatitis in the general population. The inci-denceofpancreatitiscausedbyhypertriglyceride-mia in patients with CKD is unknown, but it isprobablyalsoverylow.In1observationalstudy,the overall incidence of acute pancreatitis inpatients with kidney failure was 2.3% were identied as having pancreatitis,while31(4.3%)hadtheirrstepisodeofpancre-atitis after starting treatment for kidney fail-ure. 278Of 13 patients in whom a rst episode of pancreatitis developed after starting hemodialy-sis, in only 1 was the pancreatitis felt to becaused by hyperlipidemia, and this patient also had cholelithiasis. 278Of 217 patients who re- ceived a kidney transplant, pancreatitis devel-opedin12(5.5%),butinnoneofthesecaseswasthe pancreatitis believed to be caused by hyper-lipidemia. Thus, these limited data suggest thathyperlipidemia is a rare cause of pancreatitisamong patients with kidney failure. However,additional studies are needed to better ascertainthe incidence of CKD, suggest that ides/H11350500 mg/dL (/H113505.65 mmol/L) should be treated with TLC. In the absence of data on therisk of acute pancreatitis from very high triglyc-eridesinpatientswithkidneyfailure,itisreason-abletofollowtheATPIIIguidelines.TheATPIIIguidelines recommend that TLC include diet,weightreduction,increasedphysicalactivity,ab-stinencefromalcohol,andtreatmentofhypergly-cemia (if present). For patients with fasting tri-glycerides /H113501,000mg/dL(/H1135011.29mmol/L),the ATP III diet recommendations include a verylow-fat diet ( /H1102115% total calories), medium- chain triglycerides, and sh oils to replace somelong-chain triglycerides. Diet should be usedjudiciously, if at all, in individuals who aremalnourished. DrugTreatmentofVeryHighTriglycerides IfTLC is not sufcient to reduce triglycerides nicotinic be consid- ered(Table25).Studiesfromthegeneralpopula- bratesandnicotinicacidlower by 20% to Statinscause less triglyceride lowering, and bile acidsequestrants may (/H113505.65 mmol/L) despite TLC and/orwithdrawalofcausativeagents,drugtreat-ment should be considered. In general, brates are better tolerated than nicotinic acid. In anycase,thebene tsofdrugtherapyforhypertriglyc- Fig 7.

Toconvert risks, andtheriskofcomplications(particularlymyosi-tisandrhabdomyolysis)isincreasedinCKD. Rationale forTreating High LDLCholesterol TheATPIII Guidelines were developed using rigorous, evidence-based methods. In the ab-sence of data from randomized trials conductedin patients with CKD, it is reasonable to assumethat the interventions recommended by the ATPIII will similarly reduce ACVD in patients withCKD. However, randomized trials proving thattreatment of reduce the TheriskofCHDeventsismarkedlyincreased in patients with CKD. 2,4Therefore, patients with CKDshouldbeconsideredtohaveariskequiva-lenttothatofCHD.ThisriskcategoryintheATPIII Guidelines includes patients with knownACVD, patients with diabetes, and patients withan expected 10-year risk of CHD /H1102220%. Evi- dence suggests CKD have anexpected 10-year CHD risk /H1102220%, 2,4thereby justifying their in this highest riskcategory. TreatingProteinuria Nephrotic-rangeproteinuriaincreasestotaland LDL cholesterol. 218-223In patients with severe proteinuria, triglycerides may also be increased. It may be possible to induce a remission in thenephrotic syndrome by treating the underlyingglomerular disease. If not, it may be possible to reduce the level of proteinuria, and thereby im-prove the patient' s lipid prole. Unfortunately, few randomized controlled trials have docu-mented the lipid-lowering effects of therapiesthatreduceurineproteinexcretion,eg,angioten-sin II converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensinII receptor antagonists, and/or low-protein diets. In a randomized, controlled trial, treatment of 17 nephrotic patients with an angiotensin II con-verting enzyme inhibitor reduced urine proteinexcretion from a of 5.56 to 4.28 g per day,anddecreasedmeantotalcholesterolfrom247to 225mg/dL(6.39to5.82mmol/L). 279Therewere no changes in protein 9 placebo-treated controls. 279In a ran- domized trial of 94 type withmicroalbuminuria,treatmentwithanangiotensinIIconvertingenzymeinhibitorreducedtotalcho-lesterol ized trials of microalbuminuric type II diabeticpatients,angiotensinIIconvertingenzymeinhibi-tors had little effect on lipid levels. 281,282There are few data on the effects of low-protein dietson lipid levels. In the feasibility phase of theModication of Diet in Renal Disease study,serumtotalandLDLcholesterollevelstendedtodecreasewithreduceddietaryproteinintake. 283 There is substantial evidence that angiotensin Fig 8.

To convert mg/dL tommol/L,multiplytriglyceridesby S41II converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the rate of kidney disease progression in patients withproteinuria. Therefore, proteinuric patients withCKD should generally be treated with an angio-tensinIIconvertingenzymeinhibitororangioten-sin II receptor antagonist, regardless of plasmalipids. 2 TreatingHighLDLWithTherapeuticLifestyleChanges:Diet There are no randomized trials examining the safety and efcacy of a low-fat, low-cholesteroldiet in patients with CKD. However, evidencefromthegeneralpopulationsuggeststhatalipid-loweringdietcanreduceLDL. 3,30,284Dietshould be used judiciously, if at all, when there isevidenceofprotein-energymalnutrition.Thedietshould include /H110217% of calories as saturated fat, up to 10% of calories as polyunsaturated fat, upto20%ofcaloriesasmonounsaturatedfat,andatotalfatof25%to35%oftotalcalories(Table26and Appendix 2). The diet should also containcomplex carbohydrates (50% to 60% of totalcalories), and ber (20-30 g per day). Dietary cholesterol should be /H11021200 mg/day. There are few, if any, adverse effects from this dietaryregimen.SomepatientswithLDL100-129mg/dL(2.59-3.34 mmol/L) may achieve the goal ofLDL/H11021100 mg/dL (/H110212.59 mg/dL (2.59-3.34 mmol/L), it is reasonable toattempt dietary changes for 2-3 months beforebeginningdrugtreatment.However,patientswithCKD often have a number of other nutritionalconcerns, 285and it is important to consult a dietitian experienced in the care of patients withCKD. TreatingHighLDLWithTherapeuticLifestyle Changes:ExerciseandWeightReduction Controlledtrialsinthegeneralpopulationsug- gest that 284,289 Exercisehasanumberofbene cialeffects,inde- pendent of those on dyslipidemias, and the lackof adverse effects makes a compelling case forrecommending exercise in patients at risk forACVD. 3At least one small, randomized, con - trolledtrialdemonstratedthatexerciseimprovedcardiovascularfunctioninhemodialysispatients. 290However, few studies have examined the effects of exercise and/or weight reduction ondyslipidemiasinpatientswithCKD.Onerandom-ized, controlled trial examining dyslipidemias ina small number of patients with CKD found thatexercise caused a signicant decrease only in triglycerides (Table 27). 291Clearly, additional, controlledtrialsareneededtostudytheeffectsofexercise on dyslipidemias and otherACVD riskfactors in patients with CKD. Meanwhile, it isrecommended that exercise be encouraged inpatientswithCKD,basedondatafromstudiesinthegeneralpopulation. Fig 9.

TreatingHighLDLWithaStatin The reduction in LDL that can be achieved with TLC is generally modest. Therefore, methylglutarylco-enzymeAreductaseinhibitor)should be added, provided that there is no evi-dence of acute or chronic liver disease. Dietshould be continued as an adjunct to the statin. The dose of statin needed to reach the goal ofLDL/H11021100 mg/dL (/H110212.59 mmol/L) varies from patient to patient. Therefore, starting at a lowdose and titrating the dose upwards is the beststrategyfor ndingthelowestdosethatachieves the goal. This approach will also minimize thefrequencyandseverityofadverseeffects.Statinsreduced LDL by 18% to 55% in studies in thegeneral population (Fig 9). Statins that are cur-rently approved for use in the United Statesincludeatorvastatin, fluvastatin,lovastatin,prav- astatin,andsimvastatin. There is strong evidence from studies in the generalpopulationthatstatinsreduceCHDeventsand all-cause mortality.The reduction in mortal-ity and in CHD events is proportional to thereductioninLDL.Theliteraturesearchidenti ed only 2 small, controlled trials of simvastatin inhemodialysis patients (Table 27), and only 2randomized trials demonstrating the ef cacy of statins in peritoneal dialysis patients (Table 28).Thereissubstantialevidencethatstatinsaresafeand effective in reducing LDL in kidney trans-plant recipients (Table 29). In the absence ofstrong evidence to the contrary, it is reasonableto assume that statins will reduce LDL andtherebyACVDinmostpatientswithCKD.Statinsare clearly the most effective class of anti-lipemicagentsforreducingLDL. Elevated hepatic transaminases occur in 0.5% to 2.0% of treated with statins in thegeneral population. 325Therefore, many recom - mend that baseline alanine and aspartate trans-ferase levels should be obtained, although this iscontroversial. 325Indeed, whether statins cause hepatotoxicity is controversial. Statins have notbeen shown to worsen outcomes in patients withchronic transaminase elevations due to hepatitisBorC. 325 Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy. The risk of myop-athyfromstatinsisincreasedbyCKD,advancedage,smallbodyframe,andconcomitantmedica-tions recommend obtaining a baseline creatininephosphokinase(CK)leveltohelpintheinterpre-tation of subsequent CK levels. Monitoring sta-tin therapy with routine CK levels is probablynothelpful.Patientswhodevelopmusclepainortenderness should discontinue statin therapy im-mediatelyandhaveaCKleveldrawn.Elevationsgreater than 10 times the upper limit of normalare indicative of myositis and require at leasttemporary cessation of statin therapy. 325For pa- tients with muscle soreness and either normal ormildly elevated CK, levels should be measuredweekly, and the patient' s symptoms monitored closely. Often symptoms may improve with areduction in the dose of the statin. However, ifsymptomsworsen,thestatinshouldbediscontin-ued. Other causes of myopathy should also beconsidered,eg,strenuousexerciseorhypothyroid-ism. There are limited data on blood levels of statins in patients with CKD (Table 30). In 19patientswithcalculatedcreatinineclearances13-143mL/min,thelevelofkidneyfunctiondidnotaffectthebloodlevelsofatorvastatin. 326Pravasta- tin blood levels were not altered by the level ofkidney function in 20 patients with creatinineclearance15-112mL/min(0.25-1.87mL/s), 327or in 12 patients on chronic hemodialysis.328Lova- statin blood levels were signi cantly higher with CKD (creatinine clearance 12-39mL/min[0.20-0.65mL/s]). 329Therefore,thedose oflovastatinshouldprobablybereducedby50%in mL/min/1.73m 2)(Table31). Thedosesofatorva- statinandpravastatinprobablydonotneedtobealteredforreducedkidneyfunctionperse.Sincethere blood levels forfluvastatin or simvastatin in patients with CKD,we recommend that the doses of these agents bereduced by approximately 50% in patients withStages4or5CKD(GFR /H1102130mL/min/1.73m 2). PleiotropicEffectsofStatins Recent data from studies in the general popu- lation have indirectly suggested that some of thereductioninACVDfromstatinsmaybeindepen-dent of their effects on plasma lipids. 341,342Al- though S46TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S47bility,343ithasbeenhypothesizedthattheeffects of statins on systemic inflammation is one of the most important of these pleiotropic effects.343,344 If true, this observation could be important for patients with CKD, who appear to have a highprevalence of elevated C-reactive protein andother markers of systemic in flammation. 17-21On theotherhand,analysisofthedatafrommultipleclinical trials in the general population suggeststhat most, but not all, of the reduction inACVDfrom statins can be explained by reductions inLDL. 345TheUseofStatinsinPatientsReceiving CyclosporineorTacrolimus Cyclosporine has been shown to increase the blood levels of virtually every statin that hasbeen investigated (Table 32). The degree thatlevels are altered may depend on differences inthe metabolic pathways of the different statins.The mechanisms for this interaction are notproven, but calcineurin inhibitors may competewith some of responsible forthemetabolismofstatins.Forexample,thecyto- TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S48chrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which is thought to be important in the metabolism of lovastatin,simvastatin, and atorvastatin, is inhibited by on but is instead metabolized bysulfation.Nevertheless,increasedlevelsof fluva- statin and pravastatin have been reported in pa-tients treated with cyclosporine, although theincreases in fluvastatin were not statistically sig- nicant(Table32). There have been few comparison trials to determine if the increase in statin blood levelsfrom cyclosporine is different for variousstatins. 352Moreover, the literature search identi - ed only 1 study that examined blood levels ofstatinsinpatientstreatedwithtacrolimus.Inthisstudy, 4 patients treated with tacrolimus hadsimilar simvastatin blood levels compared to 4controls who were with simvastatinalone. 349However, since the number of patientsinthisstudywasverysmall,andthemetabolism oftacrolimusisverysimilartothatofcyclospor-ine, it should be assumed (until proven other-wise) that tacrolimus may cause elevations instatinbloodlevels. Accumulating evidence suggests that statins can be used safely with cyclosporine if the doseof the statin is reduced (Table 29). It is recom-mended that the maximum doses of statins bereduced in patients receiving either cyclosporineor tacrolimus (Table 31). The addition of a thirdagentthatisalsometabolizedbythecytochromeP450 system increases the risk of myositis andrhabdomyolysis, and therefore such combina-tions should be avoided. The new immunosup-pressive agent everolimus had minimal effectson the blood levels and pravasta-tin. 354The effects sirolimus on statins are unknown. AvoidingAgentsThatIncreasetheBloodLevels ofStatins A number of medications may interact with the metabolism of statins and thereby increasestatin blood levels. Medications known to in-crease statin blood levels should either beavoided, or, if necessary, the statin should bereduced or stopped. While this is true for allpatients, it is especially true for patients withCKDStages4-5,sincesomestatinlevelstendtobe high in Stage 4-5 CKD patients (Table 26). Itisevenmorecriticalforinteractionstobeavoidedamongkidneytransplantpatientsreceivingcyclo-sporine (and possibly tacrolimus), since cyclo-sporine often increases statin levels throughmechanisms that may be exacerbated by theadditionofathirdinteractingagent. Mostmedicationsthatarewelldocumentedto increase statin 35), brates, and nico- tinic acid (Table 36). Other agents that alsoincrease statin levels include the serotonin re-uptakeinhibitors(Table36),warfarin(Table36),andgrapefruitjuice(Table36). AddingaSecondLDL-LoweringAgenttoa Statin There are very few data on the safety and efcacyofcombinationtherapiesinpatientswith CKD.Ingeneral,itisprobablywisetoavoidtheuse of a brate together with a statin, at least until additional studies are conducted in patientswithCKDtoestablishthesafetyofthiscombina-tion. Fibrates lowered LDL by only 5% to 20%in normotriglyceridemic patients in the generalpopulation. They may actually increase LDL inpatients with high triglycerides.

Evidence from studies inthe general population indicate that bile acidsequestrants are safe and effective in loweringLDL by 15% to 30% (Fig 9). Bile acid seques-trantscanbeusedincombinationwithastatin. 380 However, there are few studies of the safety andefcacy of bile acid they the new phosphate-binding agent sevelamerhydrochloride appears to lower lipid levels bymechanisms similar to those of bile acid seques-trants. 308 For patients who have triglycerides that pre- clude the use of a bile acid sequestrant, or forpatients who do not tolerate a bile acid seques-trant, nicotinic acid can be considered as analternative second agent in combination with astatin. Studies in the general population indicatethat nicotinic acid reduces LDL by 5% to 25%,reduces triglycerides by 20% to 50%, and raisesHDL by 15% to 35% (Fig 9). There are no dataon the use of combination therapy with a statinandnicotinicacidinpatientswithCKD.Adverseeffects of nicotinic acid include flushing, hyper- glycemia, include liver disease, severegout,andactivepepticulcerdisease. TreatingHighLDLinPatientsWhoCannot TakeaStatin Patients who develop minor adverse effects from a statin may be able to tolerate a reduceddose, or a different statin. However, for patientswho do not tolerate a reduced dose or anotherstatin, a second-line agent can be used. Either abileacidsequestrantornicotinicacidcanbeused TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S51to effectively reduce LDL cholesterol. For pa- tients who cannot afford the cost of a statin,nicotinic acid offers a cheaper alternative.

TheUseofBileAcidSequestrantsinKidney TransplantRecipients Bile of immunosuppressive medications,particularlyimmunosuppressiveagentsthatbindto lipids. However, some small, uncontrolledstudiessuggestthatabileacidsequestrantcanbeused safely, without interfering with the absorp-tion of cyclosporine. In 1 uncontrolled study,co-administration of cholestyramine and cyclo-sporine in 5 heart transplant recipients did notreduce the area under the concentration-timecurve of cyclosporine. 382In another study of 6 kidneytransplantpatients,administrationofcho-lestyramine 4 hours after a dose of cyclosporinedid not reduce the area under the concentration-time curve of cyclosporine. 383Based on these verylimiteddata,itappearsthatbileacidseques-trants may not have a major effect on cyclospor-ine absorption. However, it may be prudent toavoid administering a bile acid sequestrant from1 hour before to 4 hours after the dose of cyclo-sporine,andtomonitorbloodlevelsofcyclospor-ine. Unfortunately, there are no published data on the effects of bile acid sequestrants on otherimmunosuppressive agents. In general, the risksand benets of adding a bile acid sequestrant to an oral immunosuppression regimen should becarefullyweighed.Formanypatients,theriskoftransplant rejection resulting from poor absorp-tion of immunosuppressive medication may out-weigh the benets of a further reduction in LDL from adding a bile acid sequestrant. However,for some patients (eg, patients with severe coro-nary artery disease), the bene t of a further reduction in LDL may exceed the small risk ofaddingabileacidsequestrant. Similarly,bileacidsequestrantscouldtheoreti- cally interfere with the absorption of statins. 374 Therefore, it is probably best to avoid taking thebile acid sequestrant at the same time as anyothermedication,ifthisispossible. OptimizingImmunosuppressiveAgentsin KidneyTransplantRecipients For kidney transplant recipients who have (/H11350 2.59 mmol/L), despite maximal medical management, considerationshouldbegiventochangingtheimmunosuppres-sion protocol to one that is less likely to exacer-batehighLDLlevels,ifthiscanbedonewithoutcausing undue risk to the allograft. Options toconsider include: (1) tapering and discontinuingprednisone, 212,214,255,256withorwithoutaddingor increasing the dose azathioprine or mycophe-nolate mofetil; (2) replacing cyclosporine withtacrolimus 210,211,215; (3) tapering and discontinu - ing cyclosporine,215with or without adding or increasing the dose of azathioprine or mycophe-nolate mofetil; or (4) discontinuing or replacingsirolimus with 258,259 Evidencesuggeststhatdiscontinuingorreplac- ing prednisone, cyclosporine, or sirolimus mayreduce the prevalence and severity of dyslipi-demias and other ACVD risk factors such ashypertensionandglucoseintolerance(Table23).However, in deciding to change or not to changeimmunosuppressive agents, the risk of rejectionshould be weighed against the risk of ACVD.Transplant recipients who are diabetic and/orhaveknownACVDmayhavemoretogainfromchanging immunosuppressive agents than pa-tients at lower risk for ACVD. Moreover, theeffects of immunosuppression on overallACVDrisk should be taken into account, not just theireffects on dyslipidemias (Table 39). For ex-ample,differentimmunosuppressiveagentshavedifferent effects on blood pressure and post-transplant diabetes, both of which can affect theincidence ofACVD. In any case, the decision toalter immunosuppression should be made only TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S52after fully informing the patient of the risks forTreating Non-HDLCholesterol in PatientsWith HighTriglycerides Non-HDLcholesterolisde nedastotalcholes- terol minus HDL cholesterol. No evidence has directly linked low HDL, high fasting triglycer-ides, and increased non-HDL cholesterol toACVD in patients with CKD. However, a grow-ing body of evidence from the general popula-tionhassuggestedthatthislipidpro leispartof a metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, obe-sity,hypertension,anddyslipidemia)thatisasso-ciated with ACVD. 3Measures that safely and effectively improve this lipid pro le should be consideredtohelpreducetheincidenceofACVDin patients with CKD. Indeed, several cross-sectionalstudieshavereportedthathemodialysispatients have higher levels of remnant lipopro-teins than comparable patients in the generalpopulation. 104,116-123 Studies in the general population have impli- cated increased triglycerides as an independentriskfactorforACVD. 384,385Itisconsideredmost likelythattheriskofhightriglyceridesisaresultof atherogenic, lipoproteins. These in-clude small density li-poproteins (IDL). Since VLDL cholesterol ishighly correlated with remnant lipoproteins,VLDLcanbecombinedwithLDLcholesteroltoenhance risk prediction when triglycerides arehigh. Non-HDLcholesterol is calculated as totalcholesterol minus the HDL cholesterol. In per-sons with high triglycerides, eg, 200-499 mg/dL(2.26-5.63 mmol/L), most of the cholesterol innon-HDL cholesterol is contained in remnantVLDL. Recent data suggest that non-HDL cho-lesterol may actually be a better predictor ofcoronary mortality than LDL. 386Non-HDL cho - lesterol is also a reasonable surrogate marker for apolipoproteinB,themajorapolipoproteinofallatherogeniclipoproteins. 387 Studies in the general population suggest that in individuals with triglycerides /H11021200 mg/dL (/H110212.26 mmol/L) 387Therefore,using non-HDLcholesterol as the threshold and targetfor treatment makes little sense for individualswhodonothavehightriglycerides.Mostclinicaltrials in the general population have not usednon-HDLcholesterolasatargetoftherapy.More-over, it is difcult to attribute the risk reductioninthesetrialstonon-HDLcholesterol(comparedto VLDL or LDL), because percentage changesinnon-HDLcholesterol,VLDL,andLDLcloselyparalleleachother.

Clearly, additional studies are needed toestablish whether therapy targeting lower levelsofVLDLandIDLissafeandeffectiveinpatientswithCKD. RemovingCausesofHypertriglyceridemiaand ElevatedNon-HDLCholesterol Potentiallyremediablecausesofhypertriglyc- eridemia include obesity, physical inactivity, ex-cessive alcohol intake, high carbohydrate diet,type 2 diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, and somemedicationssuchasestrogensandbeta-blockers.Corticosteroids are often used in patients withCKD, and corticosteroid withdrawal maydecrease plasma cholesterol and sive agents cyclosporine,210,215and cause ation should be the offending agent. Anabolic ste-roids can cause dyslipidemia. 248-251The with CKD has greatly diminished theuseofanabolicsteroids.However,insomecoun-tries, anabolic steroids may still be used whencostprecludestheuseoferythropoietin.Insomecases, the benets of anemia treatment may out-weigh the dyslipidemia induced by ana-bolicsteroids.TherapeuticLifestyleChangesforHigh TriglyceridesandNon-HDLCholesterol and ACVD inthe general population. There are virtually nostudies on the effects of alcohol consumption inpatientswithCKD. Studies in the general population have shown that glycemic control with diet, oral hypoglyce-mic agents, and insulin are effective in raisingHDL and lowering fasting triglycerides. How-ever, studies from the general population haveproduced conflicting results as to whether inten-sive (versus usual) glycemic control reduces therisk for ACVD. 390-392In addition, patients with diabetes and CKD may be more likely to haveadverse effects from intensive glycemic controlmeasures than diabetic patients in the generalpopulation.Nevertheless,patientswithlowHDLand/or high triglycerides should be assessed fordiabetes, and diabetic patients with this lipidprole should have as good glycemic control aspossible without causing excessive hypoglyce-mia. ObesityisalsoassociatedwithlowHDLand/or high triglycerides. Nutritionally sound diets thatrestrict calories and increased physical activityhelp to reduce weight in obese patients in thegeneralpopulation.However,therearefewstud-iesdemonstratingsuccessfulweightreductioninobesepatientswithCKD. Low-fat diets and increased physical activ- ity have both been shown to raise HDL andreduce triglycerides in the general population.Alimited number of studies suggest that thesemeasuresmayalsobeeffectiveinpatientswithCKD. Dietarysh oil supplements have been shown to reduce triglycerides in studies in the generalpopulation. Few studies have examined the ef-fects ofsh oil supplements on lipoproteins in patients with CKD, and their results have beeninconclusive(Tables27and29). DrugTherapyforHighTriglyceridesand Non-HDLCholesterol Observational studies in the general popula- tion suggest that high triglycerides are indepen-TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S54dent risk factors for ACVD.384,385Intervention trials have shown that statins, brates, and nico- tinic acid reduce the risk of CHD, and indirect evidence suggests that not all of the bene ti n thesetrialsistheresultofLDLreductions.How-ever, few studies in patients with CKD haveexamined the relationships between low HDL,high triglycerides, andACVD, and the results ofthese studies have been inconclusive (Tables 10,11,and12). Patients who are not already receiving a statin for treatment of LDL, who have and who do not have liver disease,should be started on a statin along with TLC.In studies in the general population, statinslowered triglycerides by 7% to 30% and in-creased HDL by 5% to 15% (Fig 9). Further-more, statins reduced the incidence of majorcoronary events, CHD mortality, and strokeand all-cause mortality in studies in the gen-eral population. Statins are contraindicated inpatients with liver disease. A lipid pro le and liver enzymes should be obtained within 2-3months after starting a statin, and 2-3 monthsfollowing any adjustment in the dose. TheWork Group considered whether a statin or abrate should be the rst-line agent for treat- ment of non-HDL cholesterol. Although thereare compelling theoretical reasons for consid-eringbrates in this setting, the Work Group concludedthatthesafetyandef cacyofstatins for preventing CVD has been more conclu-sively established in randomized trials in thegeneral population. Clearly, brates are inpatientswithCKD. Ifthestatinistolerated,nofurthertreatment non-HDL cholesterol is indicated. If thestatinisnottoleratedatareduceddoseorafterswitching to another statin, then consider dis-continuing the statin and treating instead withabrate. Only 4 randomized, controlled trials of lipid- lowering agents in hemodialysis patients wereidentied (Table 27). In 1 study of sevelamerhydrochloride, the effects on triglycerides werenot statistically signi cant, and in a small study of simvastatin the effects on triglycerides werereduced compared to placebo (Table 27). Only 2trialsoflipid-loweringagentsinperitonealdialy-sis patients were identi ed, and in these studies statinscausedamodestreductionintriglycerides(Table 28). Most randomized trials of lipid-lowering agents in kidney transplant patientswerewithstatins,whichgenerallycauseda15%to25%reductionintriglycerides(Table29). The levels of beza brate, clo brate, and feno brate are increased in patients with decreased kidney function, compared to con-trols with normal kidney function (Table 30).In contrast, blood levels of gem brozil do not appear to be altered by decreased kidney func-tion (Table 30). Beza brate, 334,393-401cipro- brate,401,402fenobrate,401-410and reported serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen lev-els. 334,393,394,399,401,402,404,410The mechanism for this effect is not known. Since both serumcreatinine and blood urea nitrogen are af-fected, the mechanism presumably involves areduction in GFR. Indeed, in 1 study, tubularsecretionofcreatininewasnotalteredbybeza-brate. 395However, in a study of 13 patients with normal, or mild to moderate kidney dis-ease, feno brate increased serum creatinine without altering GFR or plasma flow. 408Gem- brozil was not thought to cause increased serumcreatinine,401,402butrecentlytherewasa since dose modi cation for unlike other brates (Table 40), gem brozil should probably be considered the brate of choiceformostCKDpatients. Nicotinic acid can be used in place of - brates for patients with elevated triglycerides.However, there are almost no data on bloodlevels of nicotinic acid in patients with CKD.In1study,only34%ofadoseofnicotinicacidwas excreted in the urine, suggesting that ma-jor dose modi cation may not be necessary in patients with reduced kidney function (Table41). The incidence of adverse effects fromnicotinicacid,eg, flushingandhyperglycemia, is high. 411,412However, there are few studies examining whether the incidence of adverseeffects of nicotinic acid is higher in patientswith CKD compared to the general popula-tion. 413Insulin resistance is common in pa - tients with CKD, and a higher than expectedincidenceofhyperglycemiafromnicotinicacidwouldnotbesurprisinginCKDpatients.TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S55Isolated,LowHDLCholesterol Patients with isolated HDL /H1135040 mg/dL (/H113501.03 mmol/L) should be treated with TLC. However, the pharmacological treatment of isolated low HDL cholesterol is not recom-mended.Therearefewdatade ningtheriskof ACVDattributabletoisolated,lowHDLinthegeneral population or in patients with CKD(Tables10,11,and12).Theeffectsofpharma-cological agents on HDL are modest, and theincidenceofadverseeffectsisprobablyhigherinpatientswithCKDthaninthegeneralpopu-lation.Therefore, the risks of pharmacologicaltherapy to raise HDL (in the absence of highLDL or high triglycerides) probably outweighthebene ts.

The safety and ef - cacy of lowering triglycerides with brates and niacin have not been established in adolescents. Isolated hypertriglyceridemia in adolescents should be treated with TLC. Cases of triglycer-ides persistently /H11350500 mg/dL (/H113505.65 mmol/L) are rare, and they are generally due to an inher-ited metabolic disorder.

However, a limited number of small, random-ized, controlled trials in children and adoles-cents from the general population have foundthat statins are safe and effective in loweringLDL. 429-432In particular, statins do not appear tohaveadverseeffectsongrowthanddevelop-ment. 433A few, very small, uncontrolled trials havelikewisereportedthatstatinsaresafeandeffective in patients with nephrotic syn-drome. 434-436Thus, although statins are not approved for use in children and adolescents,and additional studies are needed, preliminarydatasuggesttheyaresafeandeffective.There-fore, statins should be considered for therapyinadolescentswithCKDandelevatedLDL,orinhypertriglyceridemicadolescentswithCKDandincreasednon-HDLcholesterol.Currently,the only statin approved by the United StatesFood and Drug Administration (USFDA) foruse in children and adolescents is atorvastatin. For adolescents who do not achieve the de- sired target with a statin, addition of a bile acid sequestrant can be considered (Fig 8). Bile acidsequestrants appear to be safe and effective inimprovingdyslipidemiasinchildren.Cholestyra-mine is approved for use in children by theUSFDA. Although bile acid resins are safe inchildrenofallages,adherencetotherapyisoftenpoor due to the high incidence of adverse ef-fects. 437-439No dosage adjustment is required in patients with CKD. However, pediatric dosageshavenotbeenestablished.Inchildren6-12yearsof age, doses of anhydrous cholestyramine 80mg/kg 3 times a day, not to exceed 8 g per day,canbeused(ProductInformationQuestran,2000;Product Information Questran Light, 2000).Ad-verse effects are common and include constipa-tion, abdominal nausea, flatulence, vomiting,diarrhea,heartburn,anorexia,andindi-gestion.Inchildrenandadultstreatedwithcyclo-sporine, bile sequestrant powders are generally mixedwith 4-6 ounces of fluid, and several glasses of waterbetweendosesarerecommended.The fluid recommended with bile acid powders may limitTREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S57their use in dialysis or patients who fluidrestrictions.Thenewer bile acid sequestrant colesevelam has not yetbeen studied in children, and thus cannot berecommended at this time. Similarly, the phos-phate-binding (and lipid-lowering) agent sevel-amer hydrochloride has not been studied and hypertriglyceridemia is common in childrenwith CKD. Bile acid resins are contrain-dicated in /H11350200 mg/dL (/H113502.26 mmol/L), (/H113505.65 mmol/L). Other potential, long-term adverse ef-fects of bile acid resins include de ciencies of vitamins A, E, and folic acid. In studies withlong-term follow-up, a folic acid supplementwas required; however, anemia - ciency was not observed. 440,441In CKD patients,hyperhomocysteinemia is more common than inthe general population, and therefore the poten-tial for adverse effects from folate de ciency caused by bile acid sequestrants is potentiallygreater.Takentogether,theseconsiderationssug-gest that bile acid resins should be used withcaution in children, and close monitoring foradverse effects such as vitamin de ciencies are warranted. Currently, atorvastatin is the only USFDA- approved statin for children, and it is approvedfor post-pubertal males with familial hypercho-lesterolemia. However, boyswith familial hypercholesterolemia 10-40 mg can safely 442,443Similar were reported with pravastatin 5-20 mg.444Additional data nutrition, are needed before statins can berecommendedforuseinchildrenofallages. TREATINGDYSLIPIDEMIAS S58IV. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS THERE ARE REASONABLE doubts as to whethertrialresultsfromthegeneralpopu- lation are applicable to all patients with CKD. It isbeyondthescopeoftheseguidelinestorecom-mend all research that should be conducted inpatients with dyslipidemia and CKD, or to de-sign clinical trials. However, it is apparent that some questions are particularly well suited forstudy (Table 42), although these recommenda-tions are not meant to be endorsements for spe-cicprotocols.

METHODS FOR REVIEW OF ARTICLES AIMS THE OVERALL AIM of the project was to develop guidelines for the assessment and treatmentofdyslipidemiasinpatientswithCKD, irrespective of the underlying cause of the kid-neydisease. The Work Group sought to base guidelines as muchaspossibleontheevidence,derivedfromasystematic summary of the available scienti c literature on dyslipidemia in patients with CKD. Two products were developed from this pro- cess: a set of clinical practice guidelines regard-ing assessment and treatment of dyslipidemia,whichiscontainedinthisreport;andanevidencereport, which consists of the summary of theliterature. Portions of the evidence report arecontained in this report. The entire evidencereport is on le with the National Kidney Foun- dation. OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS The guidelines were developed using 4 basic principlessetforthbyK/DOQI: The guidelines were developed using a sci- entically rigorous process, and the ratio-nale and evidentiary basis for each guide-lineisclearlyexplained. A multidisciplinary Work Group, with ex- pertiseinthemanagementofCKD,dyslipi-demias, and TheWorkGroupmembersworkedindepen- dently liations and hadnal responsibility determining guidelinecontent. The guidelines have undergone widespread criticalreviewbeforetheywere nalized. Development of the guideline and evidence reportrequiredmanyconcurrentstepsto: Form the Work Group and Evidence Re- viewTeam that metrics Developliteraturesearchstrategies Performliteraturesearches Screenabstractsandretrievefullarticles Review literature by members of the Work Group Extract data and perform critical appraisal oftheliterature Tabulate data from articles into summaries andcreatesummarygraphics Write guideline statements and rationales basedonliterature. Creation of Groups TheCo-ChairsoftheK/DOQIAdvisoryBoard selected the Work Group Chair and Director of theEvidenceReviewTeam,whothenassembledgroups to be responsible for the development ofthe guidelines and the evidence report, respec-tively.Thesegroupscollaboratedcloselythrough-outtheproject. The Work Group consisted of \"domain ex- perts,\"including individuals with expertise in nephrology, nutrition, pediatrics, transplantation medicine,epidemiology,andcardiology.Inaddi-tion, theWork Group included a liaison memberfrom the Renal PhysiciansAssociation. The rst task of the Work Group members was to de ne the overall topic and goals, including specifying thetargetcondition,targetpopulation,andtargetaudience. They then further developed and re-ned each topic, literature search strategy, anddataextractionform(describedbelow).TheWorkGroup members were the principal reviewers ofthe literature, and, from these detailed reviews,theysummarizedtheavailableevidenceandtookthe primary roles of writing the guidelines andrationalestatements. TheEvidenceReviewTeamconsistedofneph- rologists and methodologists from Tufts-New EnglandMedicalCenterwithexpertiseinsystem-atic medical literature. They were AmericanJournalofKidneyDiseases, S61responsible for managing the project, including: coordinatingmeetings;re ninggoalsandtopics; creatingtheformatoftheevidencereport;devel-oping literature search strategies, initial reviewandassessmentofliterature;andcoordinatingallpartners. The Evidence Review Team also man-aged the methodological and analytical processof the report. Throughout the project, and espe-cially at meetings, the Evidence Review Team led discussions on systematic review, literaturesearches, data extraction, assessment of qualityofarticles,andsummaryreporting. Development ofTopics Basedontheirexpertise,membersoftheWork Group selected several, speci c topics for re- view.Theseincludedtheincidenceorprevalenceof dyslipidemia in CKD, the association of dys-lipidemia withACVD, and the treatment of dys-lipidemia in patients with Stage 5 CKD (includ-ing kidney transplant recipients). For patientswith Stages 1-4 CKD, topics were limited toadverse effects of treatment, of dyslipidemia treatment on kidney dis-easeprogression,andtheeffectsoftherapiesthatreduce proteinuria on dyslipidemias. The WorkGroup employed a selective review of evidence:a summary of reviews for established concepts(review of textbooks, reviews, guidelines andselected original articles familiar to them asdomainexperts);andareviewofprimaryarticlesanddatafornewconcepts. Theoveralltargetpopulationforguidelineson the management of dyslipidemia included allpeople with CKD (Stages 1-5), including allpatients with kidney transplants. However, theWorkGroupconcludedthattherecentlyupdatedguidelinesoftheNationalCholesterolEducationTaskForce,AdultTreatmentPanelIII(ATPIII), 3 are applicable to patients with Stages 1-4 CKD.Therefore,therecommendationsofATPIIIwouldnot need to be modied for patients with Stages1-4CKD,exceptto:(1)classifythesepatientsinthe highest risk category; (2) consider complica-tions of lipid-lowering therapies that may resultfrom reduced kidney function; (3) considerwhether there may be indications for the treat-ment of dyslipidemias other than preventingACVD;and(4)determinewhetherthetreatmentof proteinuria might also be an effective treat-ment for dyslipidemias.Therefore, for Stage 1-4 CKDpatients,theWorkGroupfocuseditsatten-tion on the latter three issues, and otherwiserecommended that the ATP III Guidelines befollowedinpatientswithStages1-4CKD.Like-wise, the Work Group chose not to include chil-drenandadolescents(/H11021 20yearsold)withStages 1-4 CKD, who should be managed with existingguidelines,suchasthoseoftheNationalCholes- terolExpertPanelonChildren(NCEP-C). TheWork Group concluded that in most areas the ATP III and NCEP-C were applicable toadultsandchildren,respectively.TheWorkGroupconsideredthatitstaskwastode neareaswhere the modi cation andrenementforpatientswithCKD. Renement ofTopics and Development of Materials The Work Group and Evidence Review Team developed(a)draftguidelinestatements,(b)draft rationale statements that summarized the ex-pected pertinent evidence, (c) mock summarytables containing the expected evidence, and (d)data extraction forms requesting the data ele-mentstoberetrievedfromtheprimaryarticlestocomplete the tables. The development processincluded creation of initial mock-ups by theWork Group Chair and Evidence Review Teamfollowed by iterative re nement by the Work Group members. The re nement process began priortoliteratureretrievalandcontinuedthroughthe start of reviewing individual articles. Therenement occurred by e-mail, telephone, andin-person communication regularly with localexperts and with all experts during in-personmeetings of the Evidence Review Team andWorkGroupmembers. Data extraction forms were designed to cap- ture information on various aspects of the pri-maryarticles.Formsforalltopicsincludedstudysetting and demographics, eligibility criteria,causes of kidney disease, numbers of subjects,study design, study funding source, populationcategory (see below), study quality (based oncriteria appropriate for each study design; seebelow), appropriate selection and de nition of measures,results,andsectionsforcommentsandassessmentofbiases.TrainingoftheWorkGroupmembers to extract data from primary articlesAPPENDICES S62subsequently occurred by e-mail as well as at meetings. AssessmentofDyslipidemias Evidence supporting guideline statements re- garding the assessment of dyslipidemias was soughtinpublishedstudieson(1)theprevalenceof dyslipidemias in the associationbetween dyslipidemias and ACVD; and (3) theassociationbetweendyslipidemiasandCKDpro-gression. To ascertain the prevalence of dyslipi-demias in CKD, the Work Group and EvidenceReview Team examined retrospective and pro-spective cohort studies.To ascertain the associa-tion between dyslipidemias andACVD or CKDprogression, the Work Group and Evidence Re-view Team examined retrospective and prospec-tive cohort studies, as well as case-control stud-ies. TreatmentofDyslipidemias Evidence supporting guideline statements re- garding the efcacyof treatment of dyslipi- demias was sought only in randomized con- trolled trials of patients with CKD. Direct andindirect evidence on the safetyof treatment of dyslipidemias in CKD was sought in controlledand uncontrolled studies of (1) the pharmacoki-neticsoflipid-loweringmedicationsinCKD;(2)possible drug interactions in CKD; and (3) pos-sible adverse reactions to lipid-lowering thera-pies in CKD (including small series and casereports). Literature Search The Work Group and Evidence Review Team decided in advance that a systematic processwould be followed to obtain information ontopics that relied on primary articles. Only fulljournal articles of original data were included.Review articles, editorials, letters, or abstractswerenotincluded. Studies for the literature review were identi- ed primarily through MEDLINE searches ofEnglish language literature conducted betweenDecember 2000 and May 2001. These searchesweresupplementedbyrelevantarticlesknowntothedomainexpertsandreviewers. The MEDLINE literature searches were con- ductedtoidentifyclinicalstudiespublishedfrom1980 through the search dates. Studies prior to 1980weredisregarded,becausetheWorkGroupconcludedthattreatmentmodalitiesandmethodstomeasuredyslipidemiashavechangedtoomuchto reasonably conclude that evidence from stud-iespriorto1980couldbeapplicabletoday. Separate search strategies were developed for each topic. Development of the search strategieswasaniterativeprocessthatincludedinputfromall members of the Work Group. The text wordsorMeSHheadingsforalltopicsincludedkidneyor kidney diseases, hemodialysis, peritoneal di-alysis, or kidney transplant. The searches werelimited to studies on humans and published inEnglish. The MEDLINE search strategies areincludedintheEvidenceReport. The topics that were selected for the searches included the incidence or prevalence of dyslipi-demia, the association of dyslipidemia withACVD, the association of dyslipidemia withCKDprogressionandthetreatmentofdyslipide-mia in patients with Stage 5 CKD (includingkidney transplant recipients). For patients withStages1-4CKD,topicsfortheliteratureretrievalwere limited to adverse effects of dyslipidemiatreatment, the effects of dyslipidemia treatmenton kidney disease progression, and the effects oftherapies that reduce proteinuria on dyslipi- demias. The team did not conduct a systematicsearch for all studies on dyslipidemia preva-lence, association withACVD and treatment forpatientswithStages1-4CKD. MEDLINE search results were screened by clinicians on the Evidence ReviewTeam. Poten-tial papers for retrieval were identi ed from printedabstractsandtitles,basedonstudypopu-lation, relevance to topic, and article type. Ingeneral,studieswithfewerthan10subjectswerenot included. After retrieval, each paper wasscreenedtoverifyrelevanceandappropriatenessfor review, based primarily on study design andascertainment of necessary variables. Domainexperts made the nal decision for inclusion or exclusion of articles. All articles included wereabstractedandincorporatedintheevidencetables.Overall, 10,363 abstracts were screened, 642articles were retrieved and reviewed by the Evi-dence Review Team, 258 articles were reviewedbymembersoftheWorkGroup,andresultswereextracted from 133 articles, including a numberAPPENDICES S63ofarticlesnotlocatedbytheMEDLINEsearches, butaddedbyWorkGroupmembers. Format forEvidenceTables Two types of evidence tables were prepared. Detailed tables contain data from each eld of the components of the data extraction forms.These tables are contained in the Evidence Re-port, but are not included in the manuscript.Summary tables describe the strength of evi-dence according to four dimensions: study size,applicability depending on the type of studysubjects, methodological quality, and results.Within each table, studies are ordered rst by methodological quality (best to worst), then byapplicability (most to least), and then by studysize (largest to smallest). Two examples of evi-dencetablesareshowninTables43and44. StudySize The study (sample) size is used as a measure of the weight of the evidence. In general, large studies provide more precise estimates of preva-lence and associations. In addition, large studiesare more likely to be generalizable; however,large size alone does not guarantee applicability.Astudy that enrolled a large number of selectedpatients may be less generalizable than severalsmallerstudiesthatincludedabroadspectrumofpatientpopulations. Applicability Applicability (also known as generalizabil- ity or external validity) addresses the issue of whether the study population is suf ciently broad so that the results can be generalized tothe population of interest at large. The studypopulationistypicallyde nedbytheinclusion and exclusion criteria. The target populationwas dened to include patients with chronic kidneydisease,exceptwherenoted.Adesigna-tion for applicability was assigned to eacharticle, according to a 3-level scale. In makingthisassessment,sociodemographiccharacteris-tics were considered, as were the stated causesof chronic kidney disease, and prior treat-ments. If study was not considered not fullygeneralizable, reasons for lack of applicabilitywerereported. Individual tables include columns with rel- evant data describing the study sample and thusthe applicability of the study. Examples includemeanage(inyears),kidneyreplacementtherapymodality(hemodialysis,peritonealdialysis,trans-plant) and type of kidney disease (eg, diabetes,hypertension). APPENDICES S64Results In principle, the study design determined the type of results obtained. For studies of associa- tionofdyslipidemiaandCVDtheresultisdirec-tionandstrengthoftheassociationbetweenlevelof dyslipidemia and risk of CVD. Associationsare represented according to the following sym-bols: For randomized trials of treatment effect and forstudiesofprevalenceofdyslipidemia,resultsare reported as the percent change in lipid levelfrom baseline for each treatment examined, orfor the percentage of subjects with each type ofdyslipidemia (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, tri-glycerides). Quality Methodological quality (or internal validity) referstothedesign,conduct,andreportingofthe clinical study. Because studies with a variety oftypesofdesignwereevaluated,a3-levelclassi - cationofstudyqualitywasdevised: Summarizing Reviews and Selected Original Articles Work Group members had wide latitude in summarizing reviews and selected original ar-ticles for topics that were determined, a priori, not to require a systematic review of the litera-ture. The use of published or derived tables andgures was encouraged to simplify the presenta-tion. Translation of Evidence to Guidelines Format This document contains 5 guidelines.The for- mat for each guideline is outlined in Table 45.Eachguidelinecontains1ormorespeci c\"guide- line statements,\" which are presented as recommendations to the tar- getaudience.Eachguidelinecontainsbackgroundinformation,whichisgenerallysuf cienttointer- pret the guideline.

Strength of the Evidence The Work Group rated the strength of each guideline using a modication of a system origi-nallyadoptedbytheCanadianTaskForceonthe APPENDICES S65PeriodicHealthExamination.445Accordingly,rec - ommendations were gradedA, B, or C (Table 7) when: (A) It is strongly recommended that clinicians routinely follow the guideline for eligible pa- tients. There is strong evidence that the prac-ticeimprovesnethealthoutcomes. (B) It is recommended that clinicians routinely followtheguidelineforeligiblepatients.Thereis moderate evidence that the practice im-provesnethealthoutcomes. (C) It is recommended that clinicians consider following the guideline for eligible patients.This recommendation is based on either weakevidence,poorevidence,orontheopinionsofthe Work Group and reviewers, that the prac-ticemightimprovenethealthoutcomes. Health outcomes are conditions or health- related events that can be perceived by individu-als to have an important effect on their lives.Improvingnethealthoutcomesimpliesthatben-ets outweigh risks, and that the action is cost- effective. The strength of evidence was assessedtakingintoaccount(1)methodologicalqualityofthe studies; (2) whether or not the study wascarried out in the target population, ie, patientswith CKD, or in other populations; and (3)whether the studies examined health outcomes APPENDICES S66APPENDICES S67directly, or examined surrogate measures for those outcomes, eg, improving dyslipidemiaratherthanreducingCVD(Table8). Limitations ofApproach While the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive.MEDLINE was the only database searched, andsearcheswerelimitedtoEnglishlanguagepubli-cations. Manual searches of journals were notperformed,andreviewarticlesandtextbookchap-ters were not systematically searched. However,important studies known to the domain expertsthat were missed by the literature search wereincluded in the review, as were essential studiesidentiedduringthereviewprocess. APPENDIX 2. THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLE CHANGE: DIET FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Comprehensive nutrition counseling should be offered to all patients with CKD, given thehigh incidence of malnutrition and other nutri-tional abnormalities. Detailed guidelines of the APPENDICES S68K/DOQI Nutrition Work Group for adults and children recommend a regular assessment ofnutritional status and intervention by a renaldietitian. 446However, dietary management of patients with dyslipidemias is not speci cally addressed in the K/DOQI nutrition guidelines.Therefore, the Work Group made the followingrecommendations(Table46). During the initial assessment and subse- quent follow-up of patients with CKD, it and proteinenergyde cits.Ifthepatientiswellnourished, dietary modi cations for dyslipidemias can be undertaken safely. In some patients withCKD, standard CKD diet recommendationsmay have already appropriately reduced manyfoods with high unsaturated fats such as milkproducts. It is important to consider patients with low total cholesterol.Alow total cholesterol level,especially in association with chronic protein-energy de cits and/or the presence of comor- bid conditions, may signal malnutrition. Pa-tients with cholesterol /H11021150 should be the primary goal. Dietaryrecommendations may include high-proteinfoods, with a liberal intake of foods high insaturatedfat.However,inthemajorityofcases,acceptable protein sources low in saturated fatshouldbeencouraged(Table47).Low-fatdairyproducts, nuts, seeds, and beans may provideprotein, but potassium and phosphorus con-tents should still be limited. Overall, healthyfood preparation should be encouraged, suchasusingpeanut,canola,oroliveoilincooking,sincethesearehighinmonounsaturatedfats. Plant Sterols Plant sterols block the absorption of choles- terol from the small intestine by entering intomicelles, which are needed for cholesterol todissolve. Consequently, endogenous and di-etary cholesterol becomes insoluble, and istherefore excreted in stool. Plant sterolsthemselves are not absorbed or excreted well.Studies in the general population have shownthat the intake of 2-3 g of plant sterols per daylowers LDL by 6% to 15%, with LDL have been seen in hypercholesterolemicchildren 448,449and adults.450-452The use of es - ters needs to take into account daily total fatconsumption, and adjustments in caloric in-take may also be needed.There is no contrain-dication to the use of plant sterols in patientswith CKD; however, they should be used as afat substitute and not for other therapeuticreasons.Unfortunately,somecommercialprod-uctsareexpensive(Table48). Fiber Viscousber should be increased by 5-25 g per day to help reduce total cholesterol andLDL. 3High-ber diets require additional fluid intake, which may be dif cult for the anuric dialysis patient who is often limited to 1 L offluid per day. Many high-ber foods are also APPENDICES S69restricted in the renal diet due to their high phosphorus and/or potassium content. Thesefoods may have to be included more often, andthephosphatebinderorpotassiumcontentofthedialysate may need to be adjusted, to maintainnormal serum phosphorus and potassium. Sinceeach company varies the ingredients in theirbrands,itisessentialtoreadnutritionlabels,andtousethoselowestinpotassiumandphosphorus.Forexample,a1-cupportionofKellogg 'sRaisin Bran /H23041(Kelloggs, Battle Creek, MI) has less po - tassiumandphosphorusthanPost 'sRaisinBran/H23041 (Kraft Foods, Inc., North eld, IL). Common foods containing natural ber are described in Tables49,50,51,and52. Patients who are unable to consume adequate ber through their diet can add natural ber in the form of a tasteless powder to their meals(Table 53). Psyllium is a viscous ber recom- mended by the ATP III. 3The most common commercial product is Metamucil /H23041(Proctor and Gamble, Cincinnati, OH). It should be mixedw i t h8o zo ffluid per dose, which may bedifcult due to strict fluid restrictions in the dialysis patient. Magnesium may also be anexcipient in some psyllium products, and thoseshouldbeavoided.Sugar-freeproductsareavail-able for use in diabetics. Psyllium is also madegenerically, and it is imperative to review theproduct insert before use to ensure that it con-tains low amounts of potassium, sodium, andmagnesium.
