Clinical trials showed that a single dose of the vaccine had an efficacy rate of [72 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-variants.html) in the United States, and a lower efficacy in countries where [more contagious variants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html) are widespread. The vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the European Union, the [United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson.html) and other countries. Janssen Pharmaceutica, a Belgium-based division of Johnson & Johnson, [developed the vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html) in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. A Piece of the Coronavirus The SARS-CoV-2 virus is [studded with proteins](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-unveiled.html) that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for potential [vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) and [treatments](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html). Spikes Spike protein gene Spikes Spike protein gene CORONAVIRUS The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is based on the virus's [genetic instructions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html) for building the spike protein. But unlike the [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html) and [Moderna](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine.html) vaccines, which store the instructions in single-stranded RNA, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses double-stranded DNA. DNA Inside an Adenovirus The researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to another virus called [Adenovirus 26](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/health/coronavirus-vaccine-johnson-janssen.html). Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause colds or flu-like symptoms. The Johnson & Johnson team used a modified adenovirus that can enter cells but can't replicate inside them or cause illness. DNA inside an adenovirus DNA inside an adenovirus Johnson & Johnson's vaccine comes out of decades of research on adenovirus-based vaccines. In July, the first one was approved for general use \u2014 a vaccine for Ebola, also made by Johnson & Johnson. The company is also running trials on adenovirus-based vaccines for other diseases, including H.I.V. and Zika. Some other coronavirus vaccines are also based on adenoviruses, such as the one developed by the [University of Oxford and AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine.html) using a chimpanzee adenovirus. Adenovirus-based vaccines for Covid-19 are more rugged than mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. DNA is not as fragile as RNA, and the adenovirus's tough protein coat helps protect the genetic material inside. As a result, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be refrigerated for up to three months at 36-46\u00b0F (2-8\u00b0C). Entering a Cell After the vaccine is injected into a person's arm, the adenoviruses bump into cells and latch onto proteins on their surface. The cell engulfs the virus in a bubble and pulls it inside. Once inside, the adenovirus escapes from the bubble and travels to the nucleus, the chamber where the cell's DNA is stored. ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus engulfed in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus engulfed in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus engulfed in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA CELL NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA NUCLEUS ADENOVIRUS Entering the cell VACCINATED CELL Virus in a bubble Leaving the bubble Injecting DNA DNA mRNA mRNA NUCLEUS The adenovirus pushes its DNA into the nucleus. The adenovirus is engineered so it can't make copies of itself, but the gene for the coronavirus spike protein can be read by the cell and copied into a molecule called messenger RNA, or mRNA. Building Spike Proteins The mRNA leaves the nucleus, and the cell's molecules read its sequence and begin assembling spike proteins.

The vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments, which they present on their surface. These protruding spikes and spike protein fragments can then be recognized by the immune system. The adenovirus also provokes the immune system by switching on the cell's alarm systems. The cell sends out warning signals to activate immune cells nearby. By raising this alarm, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine causes the immune system to react more strongly to the spike proteins. Spotting the Intruder When a vaccinated cell dies, the debris contains spike proteins and protein fragments that can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell. Debris from a dead cell ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Engulfing a spike Digesting proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL Debris from a dead cell ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Engulfing a spike Digesting the proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL Debris from a dead cell Engulfing a spike ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Digesting the proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL The cell presents fragments of the spike protein on its surface. When other cells called helper T cells detect these fragments, the helper T cells can raise the alarm and help marshal other immune cells to fight the infection. Making Antibodies Other immune cells, called B cells, may bump into the coronavirus spikes on the surface of vaccinated cells, or free-floating spike protein fragments. A few of the B cells may be able to lock onto the spike proteins. If these B cells are then activated by helper T cells, they will start to proliferate and pour out antibodies that target the spike protein.

ANTIBODIES VIRUS ANTIBODIES VIRUS ANTIBODIES VIRUS Killing Infected Cells The antigen-presenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called a killer T cell to seek out and destroy any [coronavirus-infected cells](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/science/how-coronavirus-hijacks-your-cells.html) that display the spike protein fragments on their surfaces.

Single dose Single dose First dose Researchers don't yet know how long the vaccine's protection might last. It's possible that the number of antibodies and killer T cells will drop in the months after vaccination. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells and memory T cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades. Vaccine Timeline January, 2020 Johnson & Johnson begins work on a coronavirus vaccine. March Johnson & Johnson receives [$456 million](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use) from the United States government to help develop and produce the vaccine. July A [Phase 1/2 trial](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20199604v1) begins. Unlike the clinical trials for [other](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html) [leading](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine.html) [vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine.html), the trial involves one dose, not two. August The federal government [agrees](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-100-million-doses-of-investigational-covid-19-vaccine) to pay Johnson & Johnson $1 billion for 100 million doses, if the vaccine is approved. September Johnson & Johnson [launches a Phase 3 trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/health/covid-19-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson.html). Oct. 8 The [European Union](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-european-commission-approval-of-agreement-to-supply-200-million-doses-of-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-candidate) reaches a deal to obtain 200 million doses. Oct. 12 The company pauses its Phase 3 trial to investigate an [adverse reaction in a volunteer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/world/johnson-johnson-pauses-its-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-because-of-a-volunteers-unexplained-illness.html). Oct. 23 The trial [resumes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/health/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-johnson-and-johnson.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article). Nov. 16 Johnson & Johnson announces a second Phase 3 trial to observe [the effects of two doses of their vaccine](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-initiates-second-global-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-its-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate), instead of just one. Dec. 17 Johnson & Johnson announces its Phase 3 trial is [fully enrolled](https://www.jnj.com/our-company/johnson-johnson-announces-its-first-phase-3-covid-19-vaccine-trial-ensemble-is-fully-enrolled), with around 45,000 participants. January, 2021 Preliminary results from the Phase 3 trial are expected in January. The company is aiming to produce at least a billion doses this year. Jan. 13 Johnson & Johnson expects to release trial results in [as little as two weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-johnson.html). But the company is falling behind on its original production schedule. Feb. 24 The vaccine had a [72 percent overall efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/24/world/covid-19-coronavirus#johnson-johnson-vaccine-update) in the United States and 64 percent in South Africa, where a [highly contagious variant](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html#B1351) called B.1.351 emerged in the fall and is now driving most cases. The vaccine also showed efficacy against severe forms of Covid-19. Feb. 27 The Food and Drug Administration [authorizes the vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson.html) for emergency use. March 2 Merck will [help manufacture](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus#under-a-white-house-brokered-deal-merck-will-help-boost-supplies-of-its-rival-johnson-johnsons-vaccine) the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. April A plant in Baltimore run by Emergent BioSolutions [ruined 15 million doses](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/us/covid-vaccines-emergent-biosolutions.html) of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. April 13 Federal health officials [call for a halt](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-fda-cdc.html) in the use of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, after six women develop a rare blood-clotting disorder. April 23 Researchers are examining how components of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might [disrupt the normal blood clotting process](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/health/astrazeneca-johnson-covid-vaccine-blood-clots.html) under certain rare conditions. April 23 Use of the vaccine will resume within days in the United States, but with a [warning label](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/health/johnson-vaccine-resume.html) about the risk of rare blood-clots. May 3 Denmark announces it will [no longer use Johnson & Johnson's vaccine](https://www.sst.dk/en/english/news/2021/the-danish-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-continues-without-the-covid-19-vaccine-from-johnson-johnson), citing a risk of rare blood clots and the country's ample supply of other vaccines.
