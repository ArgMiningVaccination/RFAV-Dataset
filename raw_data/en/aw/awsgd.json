Many people have difficulty gaining weight, no matter how much they eat. There are many reasons why someone might be unable to [gain weight](https://mantracare.org/weight-gain/how-to-gain-weight/), but don't worry - we have some solutions for you! In this blog post, we will discuss 18 of the most common reasons why people can't gain weight, as well as what you can do to overcome these obstacles.

It is a complex process and there are many factors that can contribute to someone's inability to do so. These factors can be divided into two categories - physiological and psychological. Physiological Reasons Human physiology is complex, and there are many different things that can affect someone's ability to gain weight. Here are some of the most common physiological reasons why people might have difficulty gaining or gaining weight: Your genetics If you come from a family of skinny people, you might have difficulty gaining weight because of your genes. Genes play a big role in determining our natural body type and how much we weigh. This can help to explain why some people are able to gain weight easily while others have to work a lot harder at it. You have a fast metabolism Metabolism is defined as the rate at which your body burns calories. The higher your metabolism, the more calories you will burn and the harder it will be to gain weight. Having a fast metabolism is often genetics - if your parents or grandparents were thin, chances are you will be too. This can also mean that you have to eat more calories than the average person to gain weight. You're not eating enough calories This seems like a no-brainer, but it's important to make sure that you are actually consuming enough calories to gain weight. Many people who are trying to gain weight think that they are eating more than they actually are. This is often because they are not tracking their food intake or they are underestimating how many calories they are eating. The average person needs about 2000-2500 calories per day just to maintain their weight. To gain weight, you need to eat more than that. You're working out too hard or too long Working out undoubtedly has its benefits. However, if you are working out too hard or for too long, it can actually make it difficult to gain weight. This is because when you work out, your body burns calories. If you are burning more calories than you are consuming, it will be difficult to add on weight. You have a thyroid condition The thyroid is a gland that produces hormones that regulate metabolism. If the thyroid is not functioning properly, it can cause problems with [weight gain](https://mantracare.org/weight-gain-program/). This is because an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can slow down metabolism, while an overactive thyroid ( [hyperthyroidism](https://mantracare.org/thyroid/hyperthyroidism-symptoms-and-causes/)) can speed up metabolism. Both of these conditions make it difficult to gain weight. You have a small appetite Some people simply have a small appetite and don't feel hungry very often. This can make it difficult to eat enough calories to gain weight. This can have multiple reasons, such as a low level of the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for stimulating appetite. If you have a small appetite, you may need to eat more frequently or eat larger meals to consume enough calories. Your meal timings are not right Meals are not just about what's on your plate. When you eat can also affect your ability to gain weight. If you are eating too close to bedtime, your body will not have time to digest all the food and convert it into energy or fat. This means that you will not be able to use all the calories you consume, making it harder to gain weight. It is best to eat most of your calories earlier in the day so that your body has time to process them. You're not eating the right foods It's not just about how much you eat, but also what you eat. You may be eating a lot in quantity, but if you're not eating the right foods, you will not gain weight. To gain weight, you need to eat foods that are high in calories and nutrients. This means eating plenty of healthy fats, proteins, and [carbs](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/diet/carbs/). Eating processed junk food will not help you gain weight. You're not gaining muscle Muscle is more dense than fat and takes up less space, so it is possible to be overweight but have a low body fat percentage. This means that you might not look like you've gained weight, even though you have. If you're not gaining muscle, it will be harder to increase your weight. Strength training can help you build muscle and thus make it easier to gain weight. You have trouble absorbing nutrients Eating food is not just about swallowing what's on your plate. Your body also has to absorb the nutrients from the food you eat in order to use them. This process can be impaired in some people, which can make it difficult to gain weight. Conditions that can affect nutrient absorption include celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cystic fibrosis. This can also be a side effect of certain medications. You have a medical condition(s) It is no secret that our bodies are complex and intertwined. No autonomic process exists in [isolation](https://mantracare.org/therapy/issues/isolation/). Therefore, it is not surprising that there are many medical conditions that can affect weight gain. Some of the most common include: - Cushing's syndrome - Gastrointestinal diseases - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) - Growth hormone deficiency - Chronic [kidney disease](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/risks/kidney-disease/) - Autoimmune diseases - Congestive heart failure [Depression](https://mantracare.org/counseling/depression/) - Type I or [Type II diabetes](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/types/type-ii-diabetes/) - Cancer [Anorexia nervosa](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/anorexia-nervosa/) - Hyperthyroidism - Liver disease These are a few physical reasons that might be affecting your ability to gain weight. As you can see, some of these conditions are medical and require treatment from a doctor. Others, such as having a fast metabolism or small appetite, are more difficult to change. Psychological Reasons Psychology and behavior also have a significant impact on weight gain. Here are some psychological reasons why you might have trouble gaining weight: You're always dieting If you are constantly dieting, your body will become very efficient at burning calories and holding on to fat stores. This is because when you restrict your calories, your body goes into \"survival mode\" and tries to hold on to as many calories as possible. This can make it difficult to gain weight, even when you are eating more calories than usual. You're under a lot of stress [Stress](https://mantracare.org/counseling/stress/) can affect our appetites in two ways. First, it can lead to us not feeling hungry or wanting to eat. Second, it can cause us to eat more - often unhealthy - foods. [Chronic stress](https://mantracare.org/therapy/stress/chronic-stress/) can lead to weight loss by affecting appetite and increasing the release of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol is responsible for breaking down muscle and storing fat. Therefore, if you are under a lot of stress, it can be difficult to gain weight. You tend to engage in emotional eating Emotional eating is when we eat in response to our emotions, rather than hunger. This can lead to difficulties in managing weight, because we are not eating for the right reasons. We might eat when we're bored, sad, or happy - not just when we're hungry. If you find that you often eat in response to your emotions, it can be helpful to talk to a [therapist](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapist/) or counselor. You're not motivated to gain weight If you are not motivated to gain weight, it will be very difficult to do so. This is because gaining weight requires a lot of effort and dedication. You need to be willing to eat more calories than you are used to and exercise regularly. Our attitude has an indirect but impactful role in our ability to achieve our goals. You have an eating disorder [Eating disorders](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/eating-disorders/) are serious mental illnesses that can have a profound effect on weight. Anorexia nervosa, [bulimia nervosa](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/bulimia-nervosa/), and [binge eating disorder](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder/) are all characterized by disturbed eating behaviors that can lead to weight loss. If you have an eating disorder, it can hamper your ability to gain healthy weight. If you indulge in the following behaviors, it may be a sign that you have an eating disorder: - Skipping meals - Eating very little [Exercising](https://mantracare.org/therapy/self-care/exercising/)excessively - Vomiting after meals - Using laxatives or diet pills - Obsession with calorie counting [Anxiety](https://mantracare.org/counseling/anxiety/)about gaining weight Eating disorders can be extremely dangerous and should be treated by a [mental health](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/mental-health/) professional. You're not getting enough sleep [Sleep](https://mantracare.org/therapy/sleep/sleep/) is a fundamental human need. It is not only important for our physical health but also our mental and emotional wellbeing. Sleep deprivation can lead to weight loss by affecting appetite and metabolism. This happens because sleep deprivation increases the stress hormone cortisol and decreases the hunger hormone leptin. If you are not getting enough sleep, it can be difficult to gain weight. It can also lead to cravings for unhealthy foods. You have body dysmorphia and think you're fat even when you're not [Body dysmorphia](https://mantracare.org/ocd/bdd/body-dysmorphia/) is a [mental illness](https://mantracare.org/therapy/issues/mental-illness/) characterized by an obsession with one's appearance. People with body dysmorphia often think they are fat even when they are not. This can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as excessive dieting and exercise. If you have body dysmorphia, it can be difficult to gain weight because you will always think you are too fat. It can also result in an eating disorder. These mental and emotional reasons may be impacting your ability to gain weight. It is important to address these issues with a mental health professional if they are affecting your quality of life. Importance Of Gaining Weight Gaining healthy weight is important for a number of reasons. It can help: - Improve your physical appearance: If you are underweight, you may look thinner than you would like. Gaining weight can help you to achieve a more desirable body size and shape. - Boost your [confidence](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/confidence/)and self-esteem: Being underweight can affect your confidence and self-esteem. If you are unhappy with the way you look, gaining weight may help you to feel better about yourself. - Increase your strength and energy levels: If you are weak and tired all the time, gaining weight can help to increase your strength and energy levels. - Reduce your risk of health problems: Being underweight can put you at risk of developing health problems such as osteoporosis, anaemia, and infections. Gaining weight can help to reduce your risk of developing these conditions. - Boost metabolism: If you are underweight, you may have a slow metabolism. This can make it difficult to lose weight in the future. Gaining weight can help to increase your metabolism. - Increase your muscle mass: If you are underweight, you may have a low muscle mass. This can impact your strength and energy levels. Gaining weight can help you to build muscle mass. - Protect your bones and joints: If you are underweight, you may be at risk of developing bone and joint problems. This is due to the fact that bones and joints are supported by muscle and fat. Gaining weight can help to protect your bones and joints. - Enhance immunity system: If you are underweight, you may be more susceptible to infections and illnesses. This is because the immune system is supported by fat. Gaining weight can help to boost your immunity. As you can see, there are many reasons why gaining weight is important. If you are struggling to gain weight, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian. They can help you to develop a plan to gain healthy weight. Remember, gaining weight takes time and patience. Do not try to do it too quickly as this can lead to health problems. Be patient and focus on making small changes that you can sustain for the long term. With dedication and hard work, you will be able to achieve your desired weight. How To Gain Weight Safely Now that we've discussed some of the reasons why you might not be able to gain weight, let's talk about how you can do so safely. Here are some tips: Address underlying health conditions As we have noted above, there are various chronic health conditions that can contribute to weight loss. If you have any of these conditions, it is important to talk to your doctor for a proper diagnosis as well as treatment plan for treating these conditions. Eat more often If you're not used to eating several times a day, it can be helpful to start slow. Try adding an extra snack or meal into your routine. Gradually increase the number of times you eat until you're up to three meals and two snacks. You may also want to work on portion sizes. Stay hydrated It's important to drink plenty of fluids when you're trying to gain weight. This will help your body absorb the nutrients from the food you're eating. Try to drink eight glasses of water per day. In addition to water, you can also choose to drink milk, 100% fruit juice, or herbal tea. Consider supplements If you're struggling to get enough nutrients from food, you may want to consider supplements. This is something you should talk to your doctor about. They can help you figure out which supplements are right for you and how to take them safely. Some of the most recommended supplements for weight gain can include: - Protein powder - Creatine - Weight gainer shakes - Omega-three fatty acids - Multivitamins Make sure you're eating enough calories In order to gain weight, you need to be consuming more calories than your body is burning. Use a calorie calculator to determine how many calories you should be eating based on your age, height, weight, and activity level. Then make sure you are including foods that are dense in nutrients and calories at each meal and snack. Choose nutrient-rich foods When trying to gain weight, it's important to focus on quality over quantity. Choose nutrient-rich foods that are high in calories such as: - oils, such as olive oil or canola oil - nuts and nut butters - full-fat dairy products - seeds - avocados - whole grains - dried fruit - legumes - dark chocolate - yogurt - cheese - yogurt - poultry These foods will help you gain weight in a healthy way. Avoid processed foods Processed foods are often high in [sugar](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/overview/sugar/), salt, and unhealthy fats. They can also be low in nutrients. When trying to gain weight, it's important to focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods. This is because they will help you gain weight in a healthy way and provide your body with the nutrients it needs. Additionally, consumption of processed foods has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and other chronic health problems. Include exercise While you don't need to exercise to gain weight, it can help you build muscle mass. Muscle is more dense than fat, so it takes up less space in your body. This can help you look more toned and fit even if you haven't gained a lot of weight. For weight gain purposes, it is important to choose the right form of exercise. For example, instead of doing long-distance cardio, try lifting weights or doing HIIT exercises. These types of exercise will help you build muscle instead of just burning calories. If you are trying to gain weight, aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Some other forms of exercises that may help you put on healthy weight can also include: - swimming - cycling - jogging - push-ups - crunches - dips Get enough sleep Sleep is important for overall health, but it can also play a role in weight gain. When you're sleep-deprived, your body produces more of the stress hormone cortisol. This hormone can lead to increased appetite and cravings for unhealthy foods. It can also make it harder for your body to burn fat. For these reasons, it's important to get seven to eight hours of sleep per [night](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/night-eating-disorder/) when you're trying to gain weight. Manage stress levels Chronic stress can lead to weight loss or make it difficult to gain weight. This is because when you're stressed, your body produces more of the hormone cortisol. This hormone can lead to increased appetite and cravings for unhealthy foods. It can also make it harder for your body to burn fat. For these reasons, it's important to manage stress if you're trying to gain weight. Some ways to do this can include: - yoga - meditation - deep [breathing exercises](https://mantracare.org/therapy/meditation/breathing-exercises/) - getting regular exercise - maintaining a journal - practicing gratitude - spending time in nature - talking to a therapist or counselor Reconsider medications Some medications can cause weight loss or make it difficult to gain weight. If you think your medication might be affecting your ability to gain weight, talk to your doctor. They may be able to switch you to a different medication that doesn't have the same side effects. Some examples of this include: - antidepressants - anti-anxiety medications [blood pressure](https://mantracare.org/hypertension/guide/blood-pressure/)medications - diabetes medications - stimulants - thyroid medications Consult a professional Lastly, it is crucial to undertake professional help to deal with any weight issues. Consulting a professional will help you identify any underlying health conditions that may be causing your weight gain. They can also provide you with guidance on how to make lifestyle changes to support your weight-gain goals. These are just a few tips to help you gain weight safely. It's important to talk to your doctor before starting any new diet or [exercise plan](https://mantracare.org/therapy/self-care/exercise-plan/). They can help you create a plan that's right for you and make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. Conclusion If you are someone who can't gain weight, know that you are not alone.
