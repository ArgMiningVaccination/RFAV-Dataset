Chiropractic is . . . a health-care profession that focuses on the spine and other joints of the body, and their connection to the nervous system as well as disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health. The word \"chiropractic\" means \"to be done by hand.\" Chiropractors use adjustments to restore joint function and support the nervous system. Chiropractic care is used most often to treat complaints including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. We help patients maintain optimal health while avoiding unnecessary drugs or surgery. An estimated 50 million Americans see a chiropractor each year. Chiropractic focuses on the relationship of structure and function and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health. If you're interested in an effective, drug-free way to recover from injury or manage a chronic health condition, chiropractic care may be just what you're looking for. A Chiropractor is . . . a primary care doctor who specializes in spinal health and well-being. We focus on the prevention, diagnosis and conservative care of spine-related disorders and other painful joint issues. In addition to adjustments, chiropractors also provide soft-tissue therapies, lifestyle recommendations, fitness coaching and nutritional advice. A Chiropractic Adjustment is . . . a very safe, specific, controlled force applied to a joint to restore proper function and mobility. Accidents, falls, stress or overexertion can negatively impact your spine or other joints. These changes impact tissues, the nervous system and other areas of the body. Left unresolved, this can make you more susceptible to chronic problems. Chiropractic adjustments reduce pain, increase movement and improve performance. "}
