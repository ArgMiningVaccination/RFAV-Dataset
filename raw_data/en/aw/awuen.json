The group, which includes Rep. Willard Munger's great-granddaughter, Katie Morrissey, also sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Munger on his 87th birthday.By Matt Wetzel As the 1998 Legislative Session opened Jan. 20, members of the Minnesota House of Representatives celebrated those who have come, those who have gone, and those who have stuck around. When House speaker Phil Carruthers banged the gavel to open the second year of the 80th Legislature, a few familiar faces were missing from the House chamber. Reps. Ken Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie) and Barb Vickerman (R-Redwood Falls), both of whom died last year after battling cancer, were gone. Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), who was appointed to the Public Utilities Com- mission, and Rep. Doug Swenson (R-Forest Lake), who left to become a judge, were also missing. But Rep. Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie), who was sworn in just in time for the November conclusion of a special session on stadium financing, was there to begin her first regular session in the House. And she was promising to take up where her late husband left off. Also, the swearing in of newcomer Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton) was one of the first orders of business. Then there's the matter of Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), who is hardly a new face to Capitol watchers. Munger was cel- ebrating his 87th birthday on the day he began his 42nd year in the House. And this year promises to be an exciting one. The state is flush with a forecast $1.3 billion budget surplus. Gov. Arne Carlson is calling for a record investment in capital projects ranging from a new hockey arena in St. Paul to massive efforts to improve state parks and other environmental resources. And Carruthers and other House DFL leaders are calling for a \"families first\" agenda to address needs in education and child care and pro- vides new tax rebates. As the beginning of the session drew near, people around the Capitol were walking briskly, purposefully, with a clear goal in mind. They were talking on their cellular phones, pulling their briefcases together, and catching up with colleagues. After weeks of inactivity, the halls in the Capitol had come to life.Coming to order . . . House Speaker Carruthers opens '98 Legislative Sessio n Set to help open the session by presenting the U.S flag in the House chamber were two Girl Scout troops from Chaska Middle School. \"I think it was a tremendous opportunity for them to go,\" said Troop Leader Janet Paulsen, who is the mother of Rep. Eric Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie). His sister, Emily, is also in one of the troops. The scouts were enthusiastic about their opportunity. \"This is interesting. It's cool,\" said Lauren Anderson, 13. Allison Syverson, 13, echoed Lauren's sen- timents. Studying the murals and arched ceil- ings of the Capitol, she could only marvel. \"Wow,\" she said. There were many other young faces to be seen around the building. Carruthers was flanked by his two sons Alex, 8, and Rory, 6, during the floor session. And when the speaker dropped the gavel at 12:08 p.m., the Bell Canto Voices, a group of young women singers from the Twin Cities area, performed \"Irish Bless- ing\" and \"America the Beautiful.\" Then came the Girl Scouts, who presented the colors. Bills were introduced, given their first read- ings, and referred to committees, but Housemembers had little other real business to tackle. Erickson, who won a special election to re- place Koppendrayer, drew enthusiastic cheers from her new colleagues when she completed the oath. A journalism and English teacher at Princeton High School, Erickson said she was looking forward to doing some learning of her own. \"I've been challenging high school children, and now, you're going to be challenging me,\" she said. Vickerman, who died Dec. 22, 1997, was commemorated by her House colleagues, who passed a resolution to honor her and to extend condolences to her family. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) praised Vickerman as an outstand- ing person and lawmaker. \"The citizens of that district lost a public servant,\" Sviggum said. \"She was a politician who did not have an egotistical or arrogant bone in her body. Barb has won her race, and she's now with the Lord.\" On a lighter note, Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL- Spring Lake Park) presented The Kids From Fridley, a group of 30 fifth- and sixth-graders from Fridley Middle School who sang a patri-By Nicole Wood Once a year in January, former Rep. Peter Rodosovich comes back to the Capitol with more than 1,200 teenagers in tow. As state executive director of the YMCA Youth in Government program, it's his job to share with our state's future politicians his firsthand knowledge of the legislative process and the Capitol's history. (See related story, page 18) Rodosovich was elected to the House at age 22, and he credits the youth program he now runs for inspiring him to seek office at such an early age. He was a Youth in Government participant in the 1970s. He first won election to the House in 1982, and the DFLer served his Faribault-area district until 1994. In a recent interview, he said his decision to leave the House was based on a need to \"regroup\" and a desire to spend more time with his family. \"I kind of assumed that I would do 10 years of public service, and I ended up doing 12,\" he said. \"I stayed a little longer than I anticipated.\" Rodosovich, 38, still lives in Faribault and commutes to his Minneapolis office. Most of his time is spent overseeing the Youth in Government program. He also coordinates in- ternational programs for several Minneapo- lis YMCA branches and does public policy work with YMCAs across the state. He said he draws on his legislative expe- rience to educate YMCA board members about lobbying and the political process. Looking back at his time as a lawmaker, Rodosovich said he is satisfied with his accomplishments. \"I had a lot of wonderful opportunities,\" he said. \"I chaired some of the best commit- tees that anybody could chair.\" One of those was the House Health and Human Services Committee, a panel that traditionally carries a heavy workload. Last year, the committee led the overhaul of the state's welfare system, and Rodosovich grades well the performance of his former committee. \"Minnesota is doing better than a lot ofRooted in program, Rodosovich continues to cultivate youth Former Rep. Peter Rodosovich has been out of office for three years, but he returns to the Capitol as part of his job running a program that aims to teach young people about government and the legislative process.otic tune before belting out a round of \"Happy Birthday\" for Munger. Among the singers was Munger's great-granddaughter, Katie Morrissey. The Kids From Fridley got a standing ova- tion from the House, and later, some of the vocalists commented on the experience of performing in the House chamber. \"I thought it was really cool,\" said Kaitlyn Gaynon, 11. Not everyone at the Capitol was there to warmly welcome legislators back, however. At least 200 people from around the state rallied in the rotunda to protest changes in welfare programs. \"No justice, No peace,\" the crowd chanted. Buses came from Winona, Bemidji, Northfield, St. Paul, Minneapolis, St. Cloud, and Mankato to bring people to the rally, which was orga- nized by Minnesota Welfare Rights Coalition. \"We don't think they're representing us,\" said Brenda Boettcher, 35, of Winona. \"We want them to know that poor people are people, too.\" The state passed sweeping welfare reform legislation in response to a 1996 federal law that scrapped portions of the long-standing welfare system. All the action at the Capitol had even the most experienced hands a bit excited as they looked ahead to the action this year. \"It's like the first day of school,\" said Eric Eskola, a veteran radio reporter who has cov- ered the capitol since 1985. His press corps colleague, Mike Mulcahy, now covering his ninth session for KTCA Channel 2, concurred. \"You do realize the days are going to be longer,\" he said.other states with the wave of welfare re- form sweeping the country because we planned ahead,\" he said. Rodosovich pointed to the 1986 cre- ation of the Minnesota Family Investment Program as an example of a welfare-to- work program that was ahead of its time. That program, which operated in eight counties, was the forerunner of the wel- fare-to-work measures that make up the cornerstone of Minnesota's 1997 welfare reforms. Rodosovich said one of his fondest memories from his days in the Legislature is his time overseeing the 1989-90 restora- tion of the House chamber. An unofficial Capitol historian, Rodosovich researched the Cass Gilbert papers to get a feel for why the architect selected one item versus another or why he chose a particular color combination. \"There's so much history in the build- ing,\" Rodosovich said. \"When you sit in the chamber, you're so busy and you're so caught up in the activities of the day that you really don't absorb the 90-plus years of history and spirits and discussions that have taken place. Care was taken to make sure that we put it back better than the way we found it.\" Although he would not completely rule out the possibility of returning to the House someday, Rodosovich said it would take a specific goal or a strong issue to draw him back. \"I feel like I've done my job,\" he said. \"I did a good job, and now it's truly someone else's responsibility.\" Where to find information Chief Clerk's Office 211 State Capitol (612) 296-2314 This office provides copies of bills at no charge, all agendas for House sessions, and the Journal of the House.

January 20 - 22, 1998 New member Checking accounts, banking fees Banking industry critics \u2014 particularly those on the board of the public policy and advocacy group Minnesota ACORN \u2014 argue that check- ing accounts aren't as accessible to the poor as they should be, that many banks charge fees that are too high, and that account and service fees at state-chartered financial institutions should be limited. A bill that would address many of the com- plaints of ACORN (Association of Commu- nity Organizations for Reform Now) and other groups was considered Jan. 21 by the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee's Working Group on Consumer Banking. The bill ( HF1278 ) sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), would limit account fees at state-chartered financial institutions. The state can't directly regulate federally chartered institutions, but the bill would use state de- posits and loan programs as incentives to get them to comply with fee limits. In other words, the federally chartered banks could not be depositories for state money if they did not follow the limits on fees. The bill also would require that banks make available money orders for 50 cents. Some banks now charge upward of $3, and the money orders are available only to depositors. Clark's proposal also would try to stop banks from making huge overdraft charges. Specifi- cally, the measure would limit overdraft charges to $15 per check (some banks charge as much as $21 per check), and forbid the practice of clearing the largest checks first. That practice increases overdraft charges by declaring several small checks overdrafts rather than fewer large checks, said Jordan Ash, bank- ing organizer for Minnesota ACORN. The bill also would require that banks make available low-fee checking accounts, called \"lifeline checking accounts.\" State law already requires low-fee savings accounts to be avail- able. The measure would mandate that check- ing account charges be approved by the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and that they be automatically rejected if the bank doesn't offer the lifeline accounts. Marcia Erickson, chair of the MinnesotaC.J. Erickson, newly elected Rep. Sondra Erickson's father-in-law, embraced Erickson after she was sworn in during the opening day of the 1998 Legislative Session. The new legislator was joined by her mother-in-law, Judy Erickson, left, while Michael Landell, editor of the Princeton High School newspaper, right , looked on. Rep. Erickson teaches at the high school.ACORN board, presented statistics on check- ing and savings accounts. She said that 14 percent of households in Minnesota do not have checking or savings accounts and that 25 percent do not have checking accounts. A total of 41 percent of households with an annual income of less than $10,000 do not have either kind of account. She said 80 per- cent of white households have checking ac- counts, but 44 percent of households of color do not have either type of account. \"We consider these glaring numbers,\" Erickson said, adding that low-income people should not be prevented from using financial services. Erickson provided a personal story to illus- trate the damage she believes high service fees can cause. She said she asked her bank if an automatic payroll check deposit was available for use, and she was told it was. A week later, she received an overdraft notice, and in the meantime, three checks had bounced. Her company had not processed her paper- work in a timely fashion, she said, and the bank failed to check the date of the automatic deposit, so she was socked with $80 worth of overdraft fees. \"Two other entities had made mistakes, and I was charged. It had nothing to do with my management,\" Erickson said. Such fees can bedevastating to low-income people and those on a fixed income, she added. Since time ran out before hearing from opponents of the bill, the working group agreed to send the bill to the full Financial Institu- tions and Insurance Committee without a recommendation. Checks in the mail A bill that would prohibit lenders from sending consumers unrequested checks that, if cashed, become high-interest loans was ap- proved by a House panel Jan. 21. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), who is spon- soring the bill ( HF2016 ), said consumers who find such checks in their mailbox are actually receiving a loan solicitation carrying interest rates sometimes close to 30 percent. Haas said he and his wife, Joenie, have re- ceived three such checks from Twin Cities- area finance companies: one for $75,000, one for $52,550, and one for $1,531. The interest rate attached to the check for $1,531 \u2014 should Haas have cashed it \u2014 was 29.9 percent. Haas said there are several dangers that go along with the sending of such checks, includ- ing the possibility of the recipient's mailbox being robbed. \"What would happen if somebody stole the check and cashed it?\" Haas asked. \"What's going to happen?\" Creditors who send out such checks also prey on desperate or naive consumers, such as young college students, Haas said. A college student might assume the check is for a loan for which they have applied, he added. \"They'll be shocked in a month when they get a payment book, and instead of a five to six percent interest rate, they're paying 29.9 per- cent,\" Haas said. \"Let's be pro-active in the Legislature, rather than reactive.\" Haas said he knows several people who have received such loan solicitations, and it appears to be an increasingly common practice. The bill was discussed by members of the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee's Working Group on Consumer Banking. The measure would allow an exception for prospective borrowers who already have an open-end credit arrangement, such as a credit card account, with the lender. Pat Martin, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Consumer Finance Conference, said some Minnesota companies might have a problem with the bill. Some of the finance companies he represents send out the kind of checks that Haas's bill would outlaw. Hundreds of thousands of those checks are sent out annually, Martin said. He conceded that there have been some problems in the form of theft or fraud, but, he added, in such cases, the intended recipient was not liable. \"The creditor is liable for a miscashed check,\" Martin said. \"The number of abuses is small, and the number of mailings is large.\" The bill now moves to the full Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee with- out recommendation. Rent-to-own contracts Let the buyer beware: The rent-to-own in- dustry soon may be back in business in Min- nesota. A bill that would regulate rent-to-own con- tracts was approved by the House Commerce, Tourism, and Consumer Affairs Committee Jan. 22. Currently, a court order prohibits rental- purchase transactions in Minnesota. Prior to the injunction, many consumers complained that rent-to-own retailers financed purchases at exorbitant interest rates after tacking on a variety of costs to a product's base price. Retailers who previously engaged in thepractice, now simply rent goods without the option to buy. Rent-to-own stores offer goods and ser- vices without credit checks, down payments, or deposits. Instead, a payment plan is estab- lished based on the store's listed purchase price of the item, any additional fees, and interest. Proponents of HF997 say that rental-pur- chase agreements give the working poor the chance to obtain big-ticket items such as tele- visions and stereos. Bill sponsor Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) said he got involved because \"it seemed to make more sense that you could own [an item] at the end of the rental period.\" Under the bill, retailers would have to limit their purchase agreements' ancillary charges \u2014 such as set up, delivery, and finance fees \u2014 to an amount equal to the original cash price of the item. The bill also would require rent-to-own agreements to clearly state that the merchan- dise may be available from other sources at a cheaper price. David Ramp, of the Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis, said that the bill would do noth- ing to protect consumers from excessive in- terest on rent-to-own agreements. In fact, he argued, the legislation is just a way of getting around the court order. \"It's an industry bill touted as consumer protection,\" Ramp said. Last year, the Senate passed a similar mea- sure, but the House bill stalled on the floor. Legal blood-alcohol limit Minnesota could join 14 other states in lowering the legal blood-alcohol limit for driv- ers from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) is spon- soring a bill ( HF2389 ) that would do just that, and the bill cleared its first legislative hurdle Jan. 21. \"This is probably the most important pub- lic health and safety bill we could adopt in 1998,\" Entenza said. The bill was given its first hearing in the House Judiciary Committee, where it was ap- proved and referred to the Judiciary Finance Division. A similar measure was passed by the House last year. However, the provision did not sur- vive a conference committee and was not in- cluded in the final 1997 omnibus DWI law. James Fell, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official, told the committeethat the risk of being in a crash greatly in- creases at each blood-alcohol concentration level, and that it rises very rapidly after a drinker reaches the 0.08 percent level. He said that the relative risk of being killed in a single vehicle crash when drivers have blood-alcohol concentrations between 0.05 percent and 0.09 percent is 11 times higher than that of drivers who have had no alcohol. \"Virtually all drivers are substantially im- paired at 0.08,\" Fell said. He also said 0.08 percent is a reasonable limit to set. The average male would have to drink four drinks in an hour and the average female would have to drink three drinks in an hour to reach that level, Fell said. The hearing's most emotional testimony came from Pat Budig, whose husband was killed by an impaired driver who tested below the current 0.10 percent legal limit. Her son was also severely injured in the crash. \"You don't have to be falling down drunk to kill someone,\" she said. \"A crash caused by a driver who is at 0.08 is just as vicious, just as devastating as a crash caused by a driver who is at 0.10.\" Lynne Goughler, of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving, also testified during the hear- ing. Her parents were killed by a driver who tested at 0.09 percent. \"It is the most preventable crime we have. You can be just as dead at 0.08 as 0.10,\" Goughler said. \"[The change to] 0.08 serves notice on the impaired driver that society will not tolerate driving at this level.\" John Berglund, a lobbyist for the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association, testified against the bill. He argued that once people under- stand the details of the debate, they will see With a photograph of her late husband as a backdrop, Pat Budig of Lino Lakes, Minn., described how he died in a head-on automobile collision caused by a driver with an blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent. Budig urged members of the Judiciary Committee Jan. 21 to support a bill that would reduce Minnesota's threshold for legal drunkenness.that efforts to lower the legal limit are unnec- essary. \"By shifting the focus away from the alcohol abuser to the moderate, social drinker, we are shifting resources from the real problem,\" he said. \"Changing the legal limit to 0.08 does not get at the problem of the chronic offender, because they ignore the 0.10 limit.\" Berglund said that the average blood-alco- hol concentration of drivers arrested for im- paired driving is 0.16 percent and half of all DWI arrests are repeat offenders. Dennis Randelin, a former detective ser- geant from Cloquet, also testified against the bill, arguing that Minnesota's tough DWI laws should concentrate on repeat offenders. \"I want my guys out there nailing the ha- bitual DWIs,\" Randelin said. \"I don't want to go to an accident and know the guy by his first name because I have already arrested him two times.\" Entenza's bill was approved on a 16-3 vote and now awaits a hearing in the Judiciary Finance Division. SCHOOL Boarding schools for teens A bill reflecting Gov. Arne Carlson's pro- posal for $12 million to establish boarding schools for some of the state's at-risk teens had its first House committee hearing Jan. 21. Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), spon- sor of HF2321 , said the three proposed year- round, 24-hour academies would reach some of Minnesota teens before they slip from mod- erate to chronic delinquency. \"There are two types of students we envi- sion going to this school,\" she said. \"One type of child is from a family that is so dysfunc- tional that the child needs to be placed in a different kind of environment. \"The other type of child may be from a stable family who has perhaps had brushes with drugs or other problems but has not yet entered the criminal justice system. The prob- lem now is that there is no place for these kids until they've committed a serious enough crime to become part of the criminal justice system.\" Likely candidates for a state boarding school would also include teens who may have been shuttled between several foster homes, she said. Under the bill, the academies would be specifically for children in grades seven to 12 who are behind by at least one academic year and who volunteer to be in the program. The proposed $12 million would be usedfor startup costs for three boarding schools, with both public and private organizations eligible to apply for grants to establish schools. Seagren said the hope is that existing un- used buildings would be remodeled with the initial funding. And she said that academic costs hopefully would be transferred from the students' home districts and that parents would be asked to contribute as much as possible to the estimated yearly per pupil boarding fees of $4,000. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) said that because the schools would resemble reform institutions, it seemed likely the fund- ing needs would be closer to the $40,000 per year required to support a prison inmate. \"The issue is, could we provide something that would meet the need at a lower cost?\" Johnson asked. Seagren said that the program would not be cheap \"based on the nature of the children we're dealing with,\" but that the state likely would save money in the long run. \"If a child could be in the program for two to three years and it would keep them from the criminal path and get them stable and gradu- ated, then it would be successful,\" she said. \"Twelve million dollars and three facilities will not completely address the need, but it is a start.\" Though members of the K-12 Education Finance Division of the House Education Committee discussed Seagren's bill, they took no action. Testimony and debate on the issue is expected to continue. Counseling in private schools The idea of allowing public school employ- ees to provide counseling at private schools has been considered and rejected by legisla- tors in the past, but since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a relevant precedent last sum- mer, House members are taking a new look at the issue. An education subcommittee approved HF820 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph), Jan. 22. The bill would alter a state law that says guidance and counseling services can be provided to private school students only at a public school or a neutral site. Dehler told members of the House Educa- tion Committee's Subcommittee on Quality Initiatives that allowing public school guid- ance counselors into private schools would not only save money that school districts are currently spending to provide alternative lo- cations, but would increase the likelihood that private school students would take advantage of available counseling.\"It's in the public interest to have students coming out of high school who have received training in life-planning,\" he said. \"We're all better off if kids come out of school ready to go.\" Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), a co-sponsor of the bill and a private school teacher for more than 20 years, said the change would address a long-standing problem in private schools. \"For [students] to leave the building in front of their peers when everyone knows where they're headed \u2014 they [often] just didn't go [to counseling],\" he said. \"This gives them a little more confidentiality.\" Although a 1965 federal act provides for publicly funded counseling to be available to eligible private school students, most states had prohibited the counseling from taking place at the private schools since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that some such activities violated the federal law mandating separation of church and state. But a July 1997 court ruling cleared the way for public school employees to provide certain services inside religious schools. The ruling makes the content of service \u2014 as opposed to the location \u2014 what the court considers im- portant. Minnesota School Board Association attor- ney Tom Deans said that while his group is not opposed to the bill, lawmakers should be care- ful to limit the scope of any new law to services that fall under the federal Title I category, which includes remedial education, guidance, and job counseling. \"You cannot read this case to say, for ex- ample, that now we're going to send our phys- ics teachers (to private schools),\" he said. Dehler assured committee members he was not \"designing the beginning of a mushroom.\" The subcommittee approved the bill, which now moves to the full Education Committee. Child custody decisions A plan to restructure the way child custody and visitation are decided in the state's family courts was debated Jan. 21 by the Civil and Family Law Division of the House Judiciary Committee. Under current law, the courts establish cus- tody in situations where the placement of the child is an issue after marriage dissolution. Courts designate a custodial parent, and all decisions concerning the child are made by that parent. A bill ( HF1323 ) sponsored by Rep. AndyDawkins (DFL-St. Paul) would restructure state law to focus on joint decision-making between the two divorced parents. Parents involved in marriage dissolution proceedings would be encouraged to work with a mediator to compose a plan to ensure significant participation by both parents in all decision-making. Courts would then approve the parenting plan. The bill also would replace all mention of \"custody\" in the statutes with terms such as \"parenting plans,\" \"parenting obligations,\" and \"parenting is about the \"nomen- clature\" of child custody following marriage dissolution. \"I really don't want children pulled and tugged about in deciding who is their custo- dial parent,\" he said. \"That's what this bill is all about.\" Marilyn McKnight, of the Erickson Media- tion Institute, testified in support of the bill. \"Changing the laws will change the expecta- tions of divorcing parents,\" McKnight said. \"They will come in trying to figure out how they will parent in the future.\" Robert Oliphant, a law professor at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, said the changes would provide a new concept for parents involved in a divorce. \"It will provide a mindset for parents to move away from the litigation model,\" he said. Bruce Kennedy, of the Minnesota Bar Asso- ciation, said that his organization opposes the House Majority Leader Ted Winter explained the House DFLers' top 1998 legislative initiatives \u2014 dubbed the \"families first\" agenda \u2014 during a Jan. 15 news conference. Also in attendance were (from left) Reps. Kathleen Sekhon, Doug Peterson, Betty McCollum, Luanne Koskinen, Nora Slawik, Len Biernat, and House Speaker Phil Carruthers.Families firstbill. He argued that recent court changes of- fering education programs and alternative dis- pute resolution to people involved in marriage dissolution proceedings should be given time to work. And he said the courts exist for people who cannot solve such problems on their own. \"When people have conflict over their chil- dren, they have serious disputes that are real,\" Kennedy said. \"When you dig into these people's complaints, you find that they are more broad than the terminology of parenting.\" Judge William Howard, who presided over family court in Hennepin County for three years, also testified against the bill. He said family law is one of the most contentious areas of law. While family law makes up 14 percent of the cases statewide, it accounts for 50 percent of the complaints filed against attorneys and judges at the state Board of Judicial Standards, according to Howard. \"I don't know of any judge who does family court in this state who supports this bill,\" he said. Howard said that the bill would cause an unnecessary backlog in the daily practice of child custody and child support decisions and could potentially throw even more of these cases back into the courts. And, he said, small changes in terminology of law can have huge consequences. \"The essence of litigation is predictability,\" he said. Howard suggested that a task force made upof attorneys, judges, and legislators should tackle the problem, and then a pilot project could be set up to see how a new plan might work. As other issues arose, Dawkins withdrew his motion to send the bill to the full committee. Dawkins said he hopes to refine the bill to ensure broad support. 'Any willing provider' bill In the Twin Cities area, proximity to pre- ferred health care providers is rarely an issue. But for many rural Minnesotans, travel can be an economic and logistic hardship. If a patient must drive 100 miles round-trip for medical attention from a network pro- vider, the time and money can be a burden for families with strained budgets. The Health Care Access Subcommittee of the House Health and Human Services Com- mittee heard more than an hour of testimony to that effect Jan. 22. Rep. Tom Huntley (DFL-Duluth), who chairs the panel, said he wanted the subcom- mittee to hear testimony relevant to the so- called \"any willing provider\" bill ( HF875 ), sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy). The bill would require insurers and health maintenance organizations to cover health care from any provider willing to accept the insurer's payment schedule and rules. The bill would not affect self-insured health plans, which provide coverage for about 30 percent of Minnesotans. The subcommittee took no action on the bill, but it is expected to come up again this session. Those who testified about the hardship in rural areas had an ally in Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie). Otremba said she repre- sents one of the poorer economic regions of the state. She said large national companies have pur- chased local businesses, and health care ben- efits offered under the new ownership often don't contain a local medical option. She said some of her constituents have found that the doctor they have had \"for 30 years is no longer their family doctor\" because the doctor is excluded from the provider network. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) said in many cases, patients \"had a choice when they took the plan,\" but they often opt for the least expensive coverage. That often precludes us- ing their previous health care provider, and, according to him, patients often know that when they choose their plan. To include moreproviders raises the cost of the coverage, Greenfield said. \"To say it does not cost more money is a joke. Every study says so,\" he said. But Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) said \"there are a million studies about managed care, and not all of them say managed care saves money.\" Greenfield said if the bill passes, \"the prob- lem will be a lot of smaller employers won't provide health care because they won't be able to afford it.\" Peggy Schumacher, of the Dawson Medical Clinic, talked of long trips to doctors that cost families money and take them away from their jobs. Dawson, Minn., is 140 miles west of the Twin Cities near the South Dakota border. \"Rural Minnesota doesn't have a choice. It's a budget impact as well as a consumer night- mare,\" she said. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), a family phy- sician, said companies that provide health plans \"don't care how far a patient has to drive.\" He said the bill is a \"good concept that should be passed.\" 25th anniversary rally Marg Miller, a member of Epiphany Catholic Church in Coon Rapids, Minn., brought her sign to the steps of the Capitol Jan. 22 for the annual rally sponsored by Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life. This year, the event marked the 25th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.Job-seekers emerge Implementation of Minnesota's main wel- fare reform initiative \u2014 Minnesota Family Investment Program-Statewide (MFIP-S) \u2014 has gone remarkably well, according to Jan. 21 testimony heard by the finance division of the House Health and Human Services Commit- tee. Deborah Huskins, assistant commissioner for economic and family support strategies for the Minnesota Department of Human Ser- vices, said participants are already being called \"job-seekers,\" rather than \"welfare recipients.\" That change, she said, signals a shift in the perception of the people in the program. States scurried to pass new welfare laws a year ago after the federal government scrapped significant parts of the long-standing welfare system in August 1996. Gov. Arne Carlson signed Minnesota's new welfare law on April 30, 1997, two months ahead of the federal government's deadline. MFIP-S is designed to transform the state's welfare system from one that discouraged work to a process that expects families to work and raises their income. MFIP-S sets a lifetime limit for receiving welfare checks of 60 months and rewards those who find work. A single parent of two, for example, is eli- gible to receive a $763 monthly grant. If that parent finds a full-time job that pays $6 hourly,the parent would earn $1,032 a month from the work and still get a MFIP-S grant of $179 a month. As a result, the parent's total income is $448 a month more than if unemployed. Huskins said 19,835 families out of an ex- pected 40,000 have already gone through a com- puterized conversion process for MFIP-S. Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) said there are jobs currently available in Minne- sota that pay as much as $15 to $20 an hour, if people have the proper training. He asked if an emphasis would be placed on providing that training. Huskins said such efforts are to be imple- mented at the county level. There also was concern over monitoring the number of people who might move to Minnesota to take advantage of the state's relatively generous system. Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) wondered if cases of people relocating to Minnesota could be tracked. Huskins said it is being done, but no figures are available yet. Huskins also said the aim isto track which states recipients come from, the size of the household, and other character- istics. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) said he wanted to make it clear the state's welfare reform bill was not intended \"to discourage people com- ing in here for the work opportunity,\" noting the state's low level of unemployment and the Minnesota businesses that currently go want- ing for new hires. Residency requirements Police officers hired since 1993 by the city of Minneapolis are required to live within city limits, and some say it's downright dangerous for them, especially if they run into someone they've arrested. Some also say the residency requirement can be hard on the children of police officers. That's according to one officer who testi- fied before the House Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committee Jan. 22 on a bill ( HF2055 ) that would repeal the authority of the city of Minneapolis to require its em- ployees to live in the city. The city of Minneapolis' residency require- ment affects many city employees. Those who worked for the city before 1993 can continue to live where they wish, but new hires must establish residency within the city by the time they have been on the job for 18 months. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), would also repeal residency requirements for the Minneapolis School Dis- trict, the city's library board, and the city's park and recreation board. A similar resi- dency requirement in the city of St. Paul also would be wiped out. No action was taken on the bill, and it is expected to be taken up by the committee later. Al Berryman, president of the Police Officer Federation of Minneapolis, supports the bill. The decision to live in a place is a personal one and should be based on personal choice, he said. Stanek also works as a Minneapolis police officer. Other members of the Minneapolis Police Dyartment testified in support of the bill, including Jolene Lindner, a nine-year vet- eran of the department. Lindner said she grew up in Minneapolis, and enjoyed living there. \"But I wasn't arrest- ing people, and I wasn't working under cover. We're in a different line of work,\" she said. She said her 12-year-old daughter has been assaulted because Lindner is a police officer, and Lindner said a man fired a gun at the roofof her family's house while the Lindners were gone. People she has arrested in the past have confronted her at stores in Minneapolis, Lindner said, so she now does all her shopping outside the city. People in the neighborhood also have come to her house to report trouble instead of call- ing 911, she said. \"Our job is dangerous as it is, but we have tools on the job,\" she said. \"To have people coming and knocking on my door at all hours of the night is not fair. I'm not paid to do this.\" Because Lindner has been on the job for nine years, she is not subject to the residency requirement. But her husband, Rick, is also a Minneapolis police officer, and he is subject to the residency requirement. For a while, the family lived in the city. But Lindner said she got tired of dealing with the situation, so she has taken the children and moved to a house in Shakopee, while her hus- band lives in an apartment in Minneapolis. \"I can't be there 24 hours a day to protect my children from a drive-by shooting,\" she said. Among those testifying against the bill was Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles-Belton. She said it's important for the city to keep resi- dents with good jobs, and the average pay for a police officer is $44,173. \"By living in Minneapolis, employees con- tribute to the tax base,\" she said. If those high-paid employees move to the suburbs, \"there is evidence that it diminishes the quality of our workforce,\" said Sayles- Belton. The bill was laid over; it will be taken up by the committee at a later date. Expanding NATO membership Though he's not in the military, Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth) donned a U.S. Army uni- form to help convince members of the House Economic Development and International Trade Committee of the benefits of expanding NATO membership. Jaros came to the committee's Jan. 21 meeting in the camouflage uniform he wore in northeast- ern Bosnia last summer, where he spent about two months translating for NATO troops. \"My idea is that every country should join NATO, and then once everybody is joined in support of peace, we won't need any more armies,\" he said. Jaros is the sponsor of HF2417 , which calls for a resolution to be sent to President Clinton and Congress asking them to support the ad-mission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Republic of Hungary to the alliance. Committee members unanimously ap- proved the bill and sent it to the House floor. Initially, only Poland was mentioned in the resolution, but Jaros said that members of Minnesota's Czech and Hungarian commu- nities asked that their countries be added. Leaders from those communities testified at the committee meeting, and one said that NATO expansion \"is good for security, good for America, and good for Minnesota.\" Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said that she had received a phone call from a constituent asking that some Balkan countries be added to the resolution. Jaros said he had not had any similar requests but that such an amendment could be added on the House floor. Property tax rebate revisited The Minnesota Legislature, flush with a pro- jected $2.3 billion budget surplus in 1997, passed a one-time tax rebate to give some of that surplus back to homeowners and renters. The rebate was linked to property taxes paid in 1997. However, that created a problem for those who paid their 1997 property taxes before Jan. 1, 1997. Homeowners sometimes pre-pay their taxes to claim an itemized deduction for the previous year's income tax. But, under the rebate law, people who pre- paid are out of luck, because the law passed last year limited payment of the rebate to those who paid their property taxes in 1997. The House Tax Committee set about fixing things Jan. 22. The committee approved a bill (HF 2294 ) that would allow the property tax rebate to be paid to people who paid their 1997 property taxes before Jan. 1, 1997. \"It's a simple change in the law,\" said Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), who is sponsoring the bill. \"I think all of your constituents will thank you for taking care of them.\" The rebate is available to both homeowners and renters. For homeowners, it comes to 20 percent of their property taxes, and for rent- ers, 3.6 percent of their rent paid. It will come in the form of a refundable income tax credit for their 1997 taxes. Even though the rebate is a property tax re- bate, it should be claimed on the state income tax returns filed this year. It's separate from the regular property tax refund that many renters and homeowners get in August of each year.

Parking problems, solutions Officials from Minneapolis, St. Paul, the Metropolitan Airports Commission, and the University of Minnesota were among those who testified before a House panel Jan. 21 about the parking woes they face and the costly potential solutions. Only one of the officials told members of the House Transportation and Transit Com- mittee that no significant efforts to increase available parking spaces are on the way. Bob Baker, director of parking and transit services for the University of Minnesota, said no major additions to parking facilities are imminent on the campus. The university has adhered to a self-im- posed cap of 22,000 parking spots since 1992. Continued on page 17By Nick Healy Lawmakers arrived at the Capitol for the beginning of the 1998 Legislative Session to find the state still solidly in the black and the governor calling for a record investment in state construction projects. A projected $1.3 billion surplus in state coffers creates many possibilities for legisla- tors. While everything is open for debate, Gov. Arne Carlson's budget proposal calls for $373 million in new state spending, and his bond- ing request seeks more than $800 million in state borrowing for capital projects across the state. The governor also hopes to use the forecast budget surplus for tax relief, state savings, and new spending. Specifically, Carlson seeks to use $841 mil- lion of surplus funds for property tax rebates and rate reductions and tax breaks for educa- tion expenses, $207 million for a so-called \"Asian market fund\" to brace for potential fallout from instability in Asian stock mar- kets, and $373 million in new spending. A total of $172 million of the new spending would add to the bonding funds for capital projects. \"We looked at this budget surplus this year the same way we have looked at budget sur- pluses in the past,\" said Lt. Gov. Joanne Benson. \"You ought to put some in reserve, spend some very prudently, and give the rest back to the taxpayers.\" With the governor away on a trade mission, Benson took his place to unveil the budget plan at a press conference days before the opening of the session. The centerpiece of the governor's initiatives for this session \u2014 his last in office \u2014 is his plan to invest more than $1 billion in state con- struction projects. More than $800 million would come from state borrowing in the form of this year's bonding bill, and additional funds would come directly from the state's general fund. \"It is a large bonding bill,\" Benson said. \"However, it is within the restraints we set on ourselves for the state.\" The sheer size of the governor's spending plans raised some eyebrows at the Capitol, and House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) found key ingredients miss- ing from Carlson's proposals. \"While there are many things in his budgetProjected $1.3 billion budget surplus . . . Governor calls for top investment in state facilities and bonding proposals that are praiseworthy, it is troubling to see that the governor's plan contains virtually no K-12 education reforms or improvements,\" Carruthers said. \"Helping our schools do a better job of educating our children will be a major goal of the House DFL in 1998 and will be a high priority in our session agenda.\" Carlson's proposal to spend $1.02 billion on improvements to state buildings and infra- structure would require this year's bonding bill to be the largest ever. Higher education figures largely in the governor's bonding and budget plans. His proposal also focuses on the environment and economic development. Building campuses The governor's plans call for $420 million in capital improvements at higher education institutions around the state. A total of $252 million would go to the University of Minne- sota, and $168 million would go to the Minne- sota State Colleges and Universities system. Under the governor's plan, the Twin Cities campus of the U of M would see construction of a $70 million molecular and cellular biol- ogy building. Another $53.6 million would be spent to restore the Walter Library and to equip a digital technology center at the facil- ity. The governor also is calling for funds for the renovation of several of the U of M build-ings, including the Architecture Building and Murphy Hall, home of the School of Journal- ism and Mass Communication. The governor's plan also would provide $16 million for construction of a new facility for technical programs at Hibbing Community and Technical College, $11 million for the first phase of renovation of Mankato State University's student athletic facilities, and $10 million to revamp the library at St. Paul Tech- nical College. Environmental improvements The governor is calling for a total of $202.5 million in environmental projects. Much of the money \u2014 about $114 million \u2014 would be devoted to the governor's \"access to the outdoors\" initiative, and significant amounts of money also would be marked for environmental protection and infrastructure improvements. Carlson's \"access to the outdoors\" proposal calls for spending on habitat protection, park and trail improvements, and improved tour- ism promotion. Specifically, the governor is calling for $63 million for outdoor recreation projects and $50 million to go toward habitat protection. Spending on parks would include $14 mil- lion for development of a veterans memorial state park in Duluth, which would be home toDepartment of Finance Commissioner Wayne Simoneau said Minnesota's \"economy and finances are in good shape\" during a Jan. 14 press conference to unveil the administration's supplemental budget proposal. However, Simoneau also warned that the state is \"looking at a potential risk because of the Asian economy\" and expressed support for Gov. Arne Carlson's plan to set aside $200 million to guard against reverberations from shaky Asian markets. the USS Des Moines, a mothballed Navy cruiser now sitting unused in Philadelphia. The gov- ernor also is calling for $17 million to be dedicated to general improvements through- out the state's park and trails system. Another $1.2 million would be earmarked for an electronic licensing service to make it easier to get recreational licenses and permits and for other improvements in tourism ser- vices. Environmental protection projects would get $64.5 million, including $26 million for flood mitigation efforts to help prevent devas- tation similar to that caused by 1997 floods in the Red River Valley and in other areas of Minnesota. Also, $27 million would be allocated for improvements to wastewater and drinking water infrastructure statewide. Hockey and conventions The governor's proposed $213.7 million for improvements in regional economic develop- ment projects includes $65 million for con- struction of a new hockey arena in St. Paul. The project, which carries a total price tag of $130 million, would provide a new St. Paul RiverCentre arena to serve as home for a new National Hockey League franchise. The governor also is calling for $87.1 mil- lion to reimburse the city of Minneapolis for the remaining principal on the Minneapolis Convention Center, which would allow the city to finance an expansion of the facility. Other projects included in Carlson's pro- posal include $25 million for construction of a convention center in St. Cloud, $13.9 mil- lion for expansion of the Duluth convention center, $6.7 million to expand and renovate the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, and $1.5 million for a regional convention center in Fergus Falls. New spending plans Aside from his massive plans for capital projects, Carlson included about $112 million in his proposed supplemental budget for a variety of projects. That sum includes $10 million for medical education and research activities and $5 mil- lion for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention. The governor's wife, Susan Carlson, has been a leader in efforts to combat Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and she serves as co-chair of a state task force created to devise a comprehensive strategy to prevent alcohol-related birth de- fects. The governor's budget recommendations also include $10 million for county child wel- fare efforts and $5 million for child care access activities. Other spending initiatives the governor sup-ports include $5 million for the Year 2000 project, which seeks to avert computer system failures associated with the onset of the next century, and $500,000 for research of deformed frogs found in Minnesota. The DFL plans After the governor's budget and bonding proposals were revealed, DFL leaders in the House announced legislative goals for the 1998 session that include some key differences from Carlson's plan. Carruthers and Majority Leader Ted Win- ter (DFL-Fulda) said they will seek funds to reduce class sizes in public schools, to expand availability of all-day kindergarten, and to improve computer technology in Minnesota's classrooms. \"We asked ourselves, 'What are people talk- ing about around the kitchen table?'\" Winter said. \"They are talking about the quality of their children's education. They are talking about how to pay their property taxes and how to afford a college education, child care, or a decent home.\" Winter and Carruthers also said they will seek funding to help school districts imple- ment the state's new graduation standards. Other projects high on the leadership's listGovernor's Strategic Capital Budget Plan Total Recommendations = $1.02 Billion General Obligation Bonds and Direct Spending = $872 Million Use of Funds ($ in millions) Source: Minnesota Strategic Capital Budget Plan: Executive Summary of priorities include college financial aid ef- forts to make postsecondary education more affordable and an expansion of eligibility for the tax credit for child care costs. The DFL leaders also are seeking a second round of property tax rebates like those ap- proved in 1997, which will return money to homeowners and renters. And they want re- ductions in property tax rates.

Mittelstadt described the future of robotics and explained how technology can help address labor shortages and other workforce issues.By Jim Thielman The Jetsons, the ultra-mod- ern family of TV cartoons, enjoyed the luxury of a robot as a maid and butler. That remains futuristic in today's world, but if baby boomers are to continue a comfort- able lifestyle into their se- nior years and businesses hope to cater to them, robotics is the answer. That's what Eric Mittelstadt told legislators and others in a Jan. 21 lecture at the Minnesota History Center. Mittelstadt said workers still view robots as a threat to their jobs. But he said that any jobs lost will be largely hazardous or menial and that robots will make U.S. compa- nies more competitive. Mittelstadt said U.S. businesses face workforce shortages. Robotics can solve not only that problem, he said, but confront issues of safety as well. The Detroit native is the chair and chief executive officer of FANUC Robotics North America, the country's leading robotics com- pany since 1984. He has headed the venture since it formed a joint agreement between General Motors and FANUC LTD of Japan in 1982. \"The current workforce shortage is prob- ably not going to let up in the foreseeable future,\" Mittelstadt said. \"For example, in the next 10 years, 40 percent of the workforce in the automobile industry is going to retire. These are skilled jobs, and these people got those skills by being in that plant 30 or 40 years. Who's going to replace them?\" He said robotics can ease the crunch of repetitious work done by human labor. With proper education, human workers can then ascend the ladder to replace retiring, skilled workers. \"Eighty-percent of all jobs in the future are going to require more than high school,\" he said. That comment raised a question about the direction of education in America. Mittelstadt said he doesn't see college in everyone's fu- ture. But he said honing science and math skills is vital. \"In order to be comfortable with comput- ers, you have to have some knowledge of sci- ence and math,\" he said. As a mechanical engineer in the 1950s, Mittelstadt said he had that science and math background. Yet many of his peers back then told him they couldn't care less about scienceCapitol Forum Series . . care less anymore,\" Mittelstadt said. \"You have to have some kind of under- standing, but that doesn't mean you can throw out English and communication skills, be- cause someone has to get the message across.\" Mittelstadt said robotics can ease worker shortages on one end of the manufacturing process, but there must be people capable of programming and maintaining the machines in a financially feasible way. \"Employees of tomorrow must be techni- cally skilled, yet generalists,\" he said. It wasn't long ago, Mittelstadt said, that many workers feared technology would re- place them. And during the early 1990s, when the economy wasn't as strong, the fear was palpable, he said. But he said the shortage of \"lower-end\" workers is likely to continue because \"some workers are being shifted to the middle or higher end.\" Then there are the demographics. \"The baby-boomers, man, have they gotten used to having a lot of goods and services,\" Mittelstadt said. \"They're going to retire, and who's going to provide those goods and ser- vices? \"There will be fewer people trying to pro- duce or serve more. The quality of life for those baby-boomers is going to go down un-less we solve our production problems. We can't import everything.\" But can robotics help small businesses? As with other states, Minnesota has many small businesses that are looking for workers. \"It's a lot easier to engineer these devices into small businesses than large ones,\" Mittelstadt said. He described a three-man company in his native Michigan that wanted to expand its arc- welding business. The owner had no educa- tion beyond high school. Mittelstadt said with a $50,000 investment, the business owner purchased the required robotic equipment. The result was his busi- ness expanded, he hired more workers, and he purchased another piece of robotics. Mittelstadt also said robotics will allow U.S. companies to be more competitive interna- tionally. He illustrated his company's mindset when it comes to competition. FANUC is a Japanese company that encourages him to sell a largely Japanese product to U.S. companies so those U.S. companies can compete with Japanese companies. That approach has allowed FANUC to gain a position in about one-third of the North American robotics market, and achieve $2.3 billion in sales since 1985. Among the Minnesota companies using FANUC technology, Mittelstadt said, are Arc- tic Cat of Thief River Falls, Malt-O-Meal in Northfield, and Twin Cities-based 3M and General Mills. Mittelstadt directed his comments toward legislators in attendance when he said, \"The government is responsible for creating a cli- mate where corporations can succeed.\" Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), who serves on the House Economic Development and Inter- national Trade Committee, was asked after the lecture to what extent helping private cor- porations succeed is a responsibility of gov- tough question,\" he said. \"I sus- pect we need to provide some incentive that would allow technology to advance at a greater pace. It's a critical issue. We depend more on technology applications, and that may mean we need to be more sensitive to that area. \"I've long thought we need to have custom- ized training to help workers perform at an advanced level of productivity. It's a con- tinuum. The training can not be stagnant. It's a dynamic thing.\" By Nick Healy Rep. Doug Swenson's departure from the House ends the second longest run in a storied family his- tory in the Minnesota Legislature. Swenson was one of six members of the same family tree to serve in the Legisla- ture over the course of more than 100 years. Earlier this month, the Forest Lake Republi- can left the House to begin a new job on the bench in the 10th Judicial District Court in Pine City, Minn. The Legislature will not be Swenson-less, however, as Swenson leaves behind his brother, Howard, a second-term Republican House member from Nicollet, Minn. When Doug Swenson was first elected to the House in 1986, he continued a family tradition that began when his great-grandfa- ther, Swen Swenson, was elected to the House in 1886. Swen served in the House with his brother, Lars. Swen's sons, Carl and Oscar, took up where their father left off when both were elected to the Legislature during the early 1900s. Oscar was perhaps the most well-known of the group, serving in the House from 1913 to 1932, including a stint as speaker, and serv- ing in the Senate from 1937 to 1950. He was the grandfather of Doug and Howard. \"I've enjoyed the chance to serve because of that heritage, and it's been especially nice to serve with my brother,\" Doug Swenson said. \"Howard's 15 years older than I am, and this was the first time I've ever had seniority over him.\" Outside of the House, Swenson has worked as a senior assistant Washington County at- torney since 1975. Combine that with his noted legislative work on public safety issues and it is apparent why Gov. Arne Carlson selected Swenson for the judicial position. \"Swenson possesses a unique combination of experience prosecuting criminal cases and crafting legislation that seeks to find solutions to the problems facing the court system to- day,\" Carlson said when the appointment was announced. Swenson listed fiscal responsibility, educa- tion, and public safety among his chief con- cerns as a lawmaker, and he left his mark as the author of laws that toughened penalties for driving while intoxicated and clamped down on underage drinkers.Rep. Doug Swenson . . . New judge leaves behind family ties in Legislature He led successful efforts to require repeat DWI offenders to forfeit their vehicles and to create a \"not-a-drop\" standard for underage drivers. Swenson also backed a 1997 effort to lower the threshold for legal drunkenness to 0.08 percent blood-alcohol content. While that proposal did not pass, Swenson said he be- lieves the stage is set for the lower standard to become law in the future. \"Doug has made a tremendous impact on the lives of all Minnesotans through his work on strengthening Minnesota's DWI laws,\" said House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon). \"He has been a leader in securing safe streets, schools, and communities for all Minnesota families.\" Swenson served on the House Judiciary Committee, and he was the lead Republican on the Judiciary Finance Division. His work on those panels drew respect from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. \"He was a very valuable member of the committee, and I think he's an excellent ap- pointment,\" said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL- Mpls), who chairs the Judiciary Committee. \"He'll do a good job as a judge, and the people of the state of Minnesota are well served by his appointment.\" Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), whose desk was next to Swenson's in the House chamber and whose district borders Swenson's, said he will miss their conversations about the issues of the day. \"I consider him a person of integrity,\" Mares said. \"He did what was right, not always what was popular. He was a hard-working, fair- minded legislator.\" Swenson lists the fact that he never had the opportunity to serve in the majority caucus as his only regret from his days as a lawmaker. Republicans last held a controlling majority in the House the year before Swenson arrived. Still, Swenson said he will draw satisfaction from his work on crime and public safety issues. \"I've appreciated the opportunity that my constituents have given me to serve in the Legislature, and I feel that I have been able to contribute on a variety of public policy issues in a positive way,\" Swenson said. \"I will miss the opportunity to advocate for change that I believe will improve the lives of Minnesotans, but I am excited about the chance to serve in another way that is also very important.\"Rep. Doug Swenson, a leader in efforts to stiffen Minnesota's DWI laws, left the House to accept an appointment to the District Court bench.By Nick Healy Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), a fourth-term law- maker noted for his leadership on education issues, was appointed to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) last month by Gov. Arne Carlson. Koppendrayer was an assistant minority leader in the House, and he was the lead Re- publican on the K-12 Finance Division of the House Education Committee. His resignation was effective Dec. 8, 1997, and he officially assumed his new post Jan. 5. The move to the PUC is just the latest ven- ture on Koppendrayer's long and widely var- ied resume. \"If you're looking for new opportunities in life, exciting things can happen,\" Koppendrayer said. And Koppendrayer certainly has seen some exciting things in his life. Before coming to the House, he worked as a truck driver in an Iron Range mine, as a manager for Fingerhut Corp., and as an international agricultural consult- ant who assisted dairy farmers in South America, Africa, and other places around the globe. As a legislator, Koppendrayer was a straight- talker who made a name for himself as a leader in efforts to change the public education sys- tem in Minnesota. He carried controversial school voucher legislation in recent years and backed the successful effort to increase the tax deduction for educational expenses and to provide low- to moderate-income families with a tax credit for education expenses.Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer departs . . . Lawmaker called thinker, risk taker, team player Now Koppendrayer lists his work on educa- tion issues as his most significant contribu- tion as a legislator. \"Accountability and choice will enhance education,\" Koppendrayer said. \"We suc- ceeded in getting those issues raised in public awareness. Now I think the public is demand- ing accountability, and that issue is not going to go away.\" House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) expressed mixed emotions overKoppendrayer's departure. \"I'm happy for LeRoy, and I think this will be a good fit for him,\" Sviggum said. \"Obvi- ously, it's a loss for our caucus and the entire Legislature. He was a real thinker and one who was not afraid to take on some tough issues.\" Sviggum is losing more than one of his leaders in the caucus. He is also losing a confidant and roommate. For the past two years, Koppendrayer and Sviggum have shared quarters when in St. Paul for legislative busi- ness. \"He will be missed,\" Sviggum said. \"He was a real team player, and he was willing to take a risk and to step out of that comfort zone. Leaders have to be able to do that.\" Koppendrayer began serving as a member of the House Regulated Industries and Energy Committee in 1997, and he said it was that experience that whetted his appetite for the kind of work he will be doing on the PUC. Koppendrayer, who will serve a six-year term on the commission, said he looks for- ward to dealing with \"hot issues\" such as the deregulation of electrical utilities and the rapid growth of telecommunications. \"I won't be bored. That's for sure,\" he said. And Koppendrayer said he is confident other legislators will step up to fill the role he played with his House caucus. \"As soon as you think you're indispensable, look in the mirror and you're looking at your only friend,\" Koppendrayer said. Committee deadlines Each year, the House and Senate set deadlines by which most bills must be heard in a committee and forwarded through the process. By the first committee deadline, Friday, Feb. 13 , all bills must be passed out of all policy committees in their house of origin to receive further consideration this session. If a House bill has not been approved by a House policy committee by the deadline, but its Senate compan- ion has been approved by a Senate policycommittee, the bill has met the commit- tee deadline. By the second committee deadline, Friday, Feb. 20 , all bills other than those containing appropriations, must be passed out of all policy committees in both the House and the Senate. The dead- line does not apply to the finance divi- sions of the committees or the House Rules and Legislative Administration Committee, the House Taxes Commit- tee, and the House Ways and Means Com- mittee.By the third committee deadline, Friday, Feb. 27 , all appropriations bills must clear their policy and finance com- mittees and move to either the Taxes Committee or the Ways and Means Com- mittee. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. Any lawmaker may try to con- vince the Rules and Legislative Adminis- tration Committee, which includes leaders from both party caucuses, to hear a bill after the deadlines.Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer, a seven-year legislator noted for his work on K12 education policy, was selected by Gov. Arne Carlson to fill a vacancy on the Public Utilities Commission.By Sandra Donovan It was exactly two months from the day her husband, Ken, died that Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie) won the special election to fill his vacant House seat, but that's not the only reason the election was particularly notewor- thy. Otremba's success at the polls in District 11B marked the first DFL vic- tory in 20 special elec- tions, and the first such victory outside of Minne- apolis/St. Paul in 25 years. Still, Otremba's win was not what every- body was talking about when she was sworn in to the House last November. Onlookers were too busy buzzing about the fact that she would immediately be called upon to vote on what many considered the toughest, most divisive question in years \u2014 stadium financing. For Otremba, her first vote on a bill was an easy call. \"I think most of my constituents are glad I voted no,\" she said. \"I come from one of the poorer counties, so using public dollars to subsidize a sports team is just not popular. Of course, there are some who think I voted the wrong way, but every day I have someone thanking me for that vote.\" And Otremba said she doesn't believe it was the toughest vote she'll make. \"I'm a very social-justice oriented person, and I make decisions based on that,\" she said. \"I think there are a lot of tough votes.\" Although the only other elected office Otremba has held was on her local Catholic school board, she is no newcomer to politics. She attended her first DFL precinct caucusNew members . . . Otremba wins House seat in November special election with her husband in 1976, and has since served as the DFL Party chair in Todd County and as a member of the party's state executive board. \"When Ken ran the first time [in a 1994 House race], the real question was who was going to run, he or I?\" she said. \"We were both very involved in county politics at the time \u2014 he as an elected official [on the county board] and I in the party. We made a great team because we bridged the gap between elected and party politics.\" Ken Otremba won the House seat in 1994 and was in the middle of serving his second term when he died of liver cancer in Septem- ber 1997. \"We talked about it before he died, and he wanted me to run,\" Otremba said. She said she will continue to work on the issues that have long interested both her and her late husband \u2014 rural health care, agricul- ture, and education. She began work last year with House Major- ity Leader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) on a bill that would raise the minimum milk price paid to dairy farmers. She also plans to push for the creation of a Midwest compact for dairy farm- ers. \"In the northeast, several states have initi- ated a compact to set dairy prices higher,\" she explained. \"We're hoping to organize along those lines with Wisconsin, Iowa, North Da- kota, and South Dakota.\" Otremba's committee assignments mirror her interests. She will serve on the Agriculture, Education, and Health and Human Services committees, as well as acting as vice chair of the Health and Human Services Finance Divi- sion. \"I can be all fired up about dairy farmers one hour and all fired up about health care thenext hour,\" Otremba said. \"That's how I live my life \u2014 you have to focus on what you're doing at the time. \"I've learned very clearly that you have to take things one step at a time, after all I've gone through with Ken and the kids.\" The youngest of Otremba's four children, Elizabeth, 11, will be home-schooled at the Capitol during this year's legislative session. \"She'll still be enrolled at her school, and she'll send work via fax and e-mail, but she'll be with me every day,\" Otremba said. \"She needs that and I need that.\" Otremba took a leave of absence from her job as a Family and Consumer Science teacher at Swanville High School for the session. \"One reason I keep teaching is to keep in that part of the real world,\" she said. \"Ken always said that my job helped him to main- tain a balance \u2014 not everyone talks and breathes politics all the time.\" One decision Otremba has not yet made is whether to run for re-election this year. \"I'm leaning toward it and I probably will, but we keep talking it over as a family,\" she said. \"We've always had those talks, every time Ken ran for office we had them. That's just how we are as a family.\" District 11B 1995 population: 32,599 Largest Wadena Location: north-central Minnesota Top Concern : \"My main concern is to faithfully represent the people [who] live in my district and in the state of Minnesota.

HUMPHREY III (DFL) Room 102 State Capitol St. Paul 55155 Barb Vickerman (R-Redwood Falls) died Dec. 22, 1997, at her home after a battle with liver cancer. She was 64. Vickerman was serving her third term in the House as the representative of District 23A. The longtime Republican Party activist was first elected in 1992 after years of involvement in community affairs. \"Barb was a very kind and dedicated public servant who enjoyed the opportunity to serve the citizens of Brown and Redwood counties,\" said House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon). \"Her fellow members of the House are saddened by her death.\" In the House, Vickerman was selected to be the lead Republican on the General Legisla- tion, Veterans Affairs and Elections Commit- tee, and she was noted for her work on the Health and Human Services Committee and its finance division. \"In the Legislature, her efforts in the areas of health and human services, welfare reform, and veterans concerns were well known and well respected,\" Sviggum said. Vickerman was Republican Party chair for the 2nd Congressional District and she worked on numerous campaigns before she sought a seat in the Legislature. Though trained as a medical laboratory tech- nician, Vickerman listed retail sales as her occupation, and she worked in various other jobs before coming to the House. She and her husband, Gerald, ran a bowling alley for sev- eral years, and she opened a card and gift shop in Redwood Falls, Minn. Vickerman operated the shop for 18 years and sold the business twoHouse loses member . . . Vickerman's legislative post topped a varied career years before she was first elected to office. She also was an avid reader and book collector. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) got to know Vickerman well during their time together in the Legislature. Serving bordering southern Minnesota districts, Harder and Vickerman often ran into each other at county fairs and other local events, and they were roommates while in St. Paul for legislative sessions. \"She was really my mentor and role model, and she set an excellent example for me,\" Harder said. \"She was not flashy. She was a soft-spoken person, and she was very succinct in her communication. When she spoke, her words commanded attention.\" Harder said she learned of Vickerman's ill-ness when the two were at the Capitol for a June special session. Vickerman received can- cer treatment during the summer, and she was able to attend an August special session on flood relief. However, Vickerman's illness pre- vented her from attending a fall special session on stadium financing. Gov. Arne Carlson praised Vickerman's leg- islative work and expressed condolences fol- lowing her death. \"Her unique blend of a strong commitment to family and community and good old-fash- ioned common sense made her an effective legislator,\" Carlson said. Vickerman is survived by her husband, four children, and five grandchildren. Rep. Barb Vickerman speaks on the House floor during the 1997 session. University figures put the total of day students and full-time staff and faculty at roughly 51,000. Considering the cost of parking ramp con- struction, the committee lauded the university's controlled approach. Mike Monahan, director of transportation for the city of Minneapolis, told the commit- tee that underground ramp construction costs about $22,000 to $26,000 per stall. Above grade, the cost falls to about $13,000 to $14,000 per stall, he said. Annual maintenance runs about another $750 to $900 per stall. Monahan said Minneapolis develops park- ing \"only as we see the need.\" Typically, thecity plans three to five years ahead. Currently, the 62,000 downtown Minneapolis parking spots are at 98 percent occupancy at 1 p.m. each weekday, he said. Chuck Armstrong, assistant to the mayor of St. Paul, said his city has 4,000 new spots in the development stage. However, he said, we \"can't build our way out of this problem.\" He said a good transit system that people use is vital. To that end, Baker's \"U-Pass Program\" gen- erated interest among committee members. The program would provide U of M students, staff and faculty with a bus pass that offers unlimited rides anywhere, anytime on any route on the Twin Cities metropolitan bus system. Baker said the program's goal would be toease traffic congestion and university parking congestion, enhance the air quality, and create lifetime public transit riders. The university also has begun to encourage bicycle riders by offering bike racks on many of its Campus Connector buses. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), who chairs the committee, asked Mike Christensen of the Department of Transportation how the Twin Cities compares to other metropolitan areas in availability and usage of park-and-ride ser- vices. Christensen said the metro area has 210 park-and-ride areas with 10,000 spaces, and there is 75 percent usage. He did not have comparable figures from other metro areas.Continued from page 10By Nicole Wood Minnesota's future politicians, lobbyists, and journalists held a trial run at the Capitol Jan. 8-11. More than 1,250 students in grades eight through 12 gathered in St. Paul for the 44th annual session of the YMCA Youth in Gov- ernment program. \"We are the next generation, and we have come to make a difference,\" said Victoria Cameron, 18, of Lakeville, who played the role of governor in the mock lawmaking session. Youth in Government gives students from across the state an opportunity to experience the legislative process in the very place where the real Legislature meets.Youth in Government . . . Growe: They'll be 'running the state in a few years' model legislature, but it has expanded to in- clude the judicial branch, constitutional offic- ers, the media, and lobbyists. Participants now fill the many roles involved in the process \u2014 from that of a page to the governor. \"I try to emphasize the government as a process and how the pieces fit together,\" Lindquist said. \"The Legislature doesn't just pass bills in a vacuum.\" Participants in the model legislature began learning about the process months in advance by researching and writing bills and memoriz- ing parliamentary procedure. Once in St. Paul, they followed their bills through the committee process all the way to the House and Senate floors.

The editors\"Being at the Capitol is just absolutely amaz- ing because we are the only youth program to use the House chamber in Minnesota,\" said 18-year-old St. Paul resident Carly Skorczewski, who was speaker of the House in the program. \"It's such an honor that we've been able to hold this level of respect among the representatives that they'll let us come in and do this.\" The program has existed nationally since 1936. Over the years, it has evolved into what Orville Lindquist, Youth in Government state program director and former participant, de- scribed as a \"process program.\" Youth in Government began simply as aprocess came complete with pressure from participants serving as members of the execu- tive and judicial branches, lobbyists, and re- porters. Topics of debate on the House floor in- cluded motor vehicle safety, handicapped ac- cessibility requirements, and high school attendance regulations. Skorczewski said the most controversial bill to pass during this year's mock session autho- rized same-sex marriages. \"By nature, teenagers seem to be a little more liberal,\" she said. The program's popularity has grown along with its scope. The number of participants hasgrown by five times since 1980, said Peter Rodosovich, who served six terms in the Min- nesota House of Representatives ( See related story, page 4) and is now the state executive director of the Youth In Government pro- gram. \"I really think it's been sold from person to person,\" said Rodosovich, also a former par- ticipant in the program. \"I think kids really have a good experience with the academic components that they're participating in. They take it very seriously.\" Rodosovich also said the program provides a valuable learning experience by introducing young people to peers who come from widely varied backgrounds. \"I like meeting people from across the state,\" said Melanie Wilken, 17, of Fridley, who served as floor leader during the mock session. \"It's really a good experience. When I get older, these are the people who are going to be run- ning the state.\" Secretary of State Joan Growe echoed Wilken's remarks when Growe stopped by to call the session of Youth in Government to order. \"We need you,\" Growe said. \"We need your ideas. We need your talent. We need your enthusiasm, and we need your hard work. You are the ones who are going to be running the state in a few years.\" Many past Youth in Government partici- pants have gone on to hold elected office. Second District Congressman David Minge is probably the most well-known former par- ticipant. Minge was youth governor in 1960. Rodosovich also recalled that former Reps. Craig Shaver and Dean Hartle, who had served with him in the House in the 1980s, were veterans of the program. Skorczewski said she would definitely like to run for office someday. While honored to sit in the speaker's chair this year, she said she was surprised to find crib sheets on parlia- mentary procedure and House rules at his desk. \"I had to memorize everything,\" she said. \"I'm not saying I'm better than him; I'm just saying I want his job.\" Victoria Cameron, Lakeville, who was elected governor for the YMCA Youth in Government mock legislative session, is sworn in by Minnesota Chief Justice A. M. (Sandy) Keith in the House chamber.By Grant Martin State legislatures have a real image problem and it is up to legislators to fix it, according to Alan Rosenthal, professor of public policy at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University. \"If the legislature doesn't try to support and explain representative democracy, it isn't go- ing to happen,\" Rosenthal said to legislators and the public at the state Capitol on Dec. 18, 1997. Rosenthal, author of the new book The Decline of Representative Democracy , said that while state legislatures have become increas- ingly democratic and responsive, the public perceives the opposite to be true. \"Any public opinion poll in whatever state shows that the job performance of legislatures has been down for years,\" Rosenthal said. \"Generally, confidence that people have in their political institutions at the state, federal, and local level is down. \"The pictures that people get in their heads are not necessarily the pictures we think we're projecting. In today's world, appearance has become reality and reality is less important. It's how things look.\" Rosenthal suggested that the reason state legislatures are perceived negatively has to do with the lawmaking process.Prof. Alan Rosenthal says . . . Public perception of state legislatures needs fixing the competition, and the media also contrib- utes to the problem by focusing on scandal as entertainment. Nonetheless, Rosenthal said, the legislative process works. \"It's a process that's improved, in my opin- ion, since I have been watching legislatures,\" he said. \"It's a remarkable process. It is now more open. It is more accessible \u2014 anybody can penetrate this place. It is deliberative. It's deliberation on the run. A lot of thought goes into legislation. It is, in my mind, as demo- cratic as any process can be.\" He pointed to the services that legislators provide their constituents as examples of re- sponsiveness. Rosenthal also said that legisla- tures are also responsive to special interests. Although this is often a criticism of the insti- tution, it should not be, according to Rosenthal. He argued that special interest groups are made up of the voting citizenry. He said that four out of seven people in this country belong to an organization that could be labeled spe- cial interest and two out of seven belong to four or more such organizations. \"We have met the special interests and they are us,\" Rosenthal said. Rosenthal said there are several methodsthat can be used to change the public's percep- tion of the legislature. Campaign finance and ethics laws should continue to be used to clean up the appearance of impropriety, he said. And legislators should work on building a relationship with both media and the public. \"Members have got to take responsibility for their institution,\" he said. \"They have got to be concerned about the Senate or the House.\" Legislators questioned Rosenthal on a vari- ety of points. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) expressed her opinion that television coverage, while educational, often gives the public a bad impression of the legislature. Rosenthal responded with an example that demonstrated his view of a responsive and image-conscious legislature. When J. Clyde Ballard, speaker of the Washington State House Photo by David J. Oakes Senate Media Services \"The pictures that people get in their heads are not necessarily the pictures we think we're projecting. In today's world, appearance has become reality and reality is less important. It's how things look.\" \u2014Prof. Alan Rosenthal\"It's a process that's improved, in my opinion, since I have been watching legislatures. It's a remarkable process. It is now more open. It is more accessible \u2014 anybody can penetrate this place. \" \u2014Prof. Alan Rosenthal \"It's a bad looking process,\" he said. \"It is confusing and messy. It is unfathomable. It is not meant to be understood. It borders on [the] chaotic, and it can easily be lampooned.\" Rosenthal also cited other factors that make the image of legislatures unappealing. For ex- ample, legislatures are competitive and frag- mented. As demands are made on the institution, lines are drawn and redrawn. The public, Rosenthal said, is often turned off byof Representatives, heard complaints that the committee process focused on the testimony of legislators and did not give the public enough time to present their views, he restructured the process. Now, when a bill is presented, the public testifies first and legislators present after all public testimony is completed. Rosenthal said that while he would not go as far as prescribing this approach for all states, the example shows how legislatures can re- spond to enlighten and serve the public.

Marshall was a Civil War hero and Minnesota's fifth gover- nor, but his initial ap- pearance on the political scene was less than statesmanlike. At the age of 24, Marshall, who hailed from St. Anthony, was among the 18 men sworn into the House of Representatives when Minnesota's First Territorial Legislature con- vened in 1849. Lawmakers at that time were charged with the dif- ficult task of creating a gov- ernment in a sparsely populated, geographically immense wilderness. It was not unusual for debate to get a bit heated, but Marshall was involved in an exchange that was un- usual by any standards. During that first session, Marshall was addressing the other members of the House when a member seated in front of Marshall called him a liar. Marshall was quick to respond. The future governor leapt over his desk and, before anyone realized what was hap- pening, he knocked his critic to the floor. Marshall then returned to his seat, apolo- gized for the disturbance, and continued with his remarks. Similar actions today would undoubt- edly stir a great uproar, but in 1849, Marshall's behavior was attributed to pio- Fifth governor bursts onto political scene neer ethics and the matter was largely ignored by other members of the Territo- rial Legislature. By the time Marshall became governor, his outburst in the House was long forgot- ten. Marshall's career outside of politics was marked by his diverse interests and many pursuits. He worked as a miner, banker, merchant, and editor at various times in his life. In fact, he was part owner of the St. Paul Press and was briefly owner of the St. Paul Dispatch. Marshall became a brigadier general during the Civil War, and he was wounded at the Battle of Mobile. After the war, Marshall returned to Minnesota, ran for governor as a Republi- can, and won. He took of- fice in 1866 and served two two-year terms as the state's chief executive. His administration was noted for the state's rapid growth (the population doubled to 350,000 during Marshall's time in office) and for Marshall's push to give African-Ameri- cans the right to vote in Minnesota. He succeeded in that effort in 1868, before the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified and all states were forbidden to deny the right to vote on the basis of race.William Marshall, Minnesota's fifth governor, lived by pioneer ethics while a member of the Territorial Legislature. Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth) demon- strated the Legislature's commitment to cus- tomer service during a Jan. 22 meeting of the Housing and Housing Finance Division of the House Economic Development and Interna- tional Trade Committee. Nadezhda Lelyukh and her husband, Vladimir, were testifying in Russian through a translator. Lelyukh spoke of her family's hous- ing difficulties as recent immigrants. Lelyukh and other Russian immigrants were asked to testify on a bill ( HF2342 ) that would extend a state program that provides grants to counties and community-based nonprofits todevelop innovative ways to keep people in their homes and out of emergency shelters. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls). Lelyukh was surprised when Jaros asked his questions directly in Russian. She then began answering his questions without the use of the translator. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park) soon reminded Jaros that the vote would take place in English and that it would be a great help to the other members if he would translate his question so all the members could follow. The committee is still considering the bill. Photo courtesy Minnesota Historical SocietyBy Grant Martin When the Legislature adjourns this spring, Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) will have 21 legislative sessions under his belt, surpass- ing Walter E. Day as the person serving the most sessions in the Minnesota House of Rep- resentatives. Munger was honored by his House peers Jan. 20, the first day of the legislative session and Munger's 87th birthday. A student choir from Fridley Middle School, of which Munger's great-granddaughter Katie Morrissey is a member, led the House in sing- ing \"Happy Birthday.\" And a reception was held in his honor in the House retiring room. Munger currently holds the record for the most years served in the House at 41 years. He was first elected in 1954 from his West Duluth district. He has served the district since then with the exception of the 1965-66 session, which he missed after losing in a 1964 state Senate campaign. An activist and pioneer in environmental legislation, Munger has chaired the House Environment and Natural Resources Com- mittee since 1973, except when Republicans briefly held a controlling majority in the House. His most noted legislative accomplishments include passage of the Environment and Natu- ral Resources Trust Fund, the Solid Waste Reduction and Recycling Act of 1989, and the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991. \"I've loved every bit of it,\" Munger said. \"I am in a position to carry out the dreams I have had since I was a kid.\" Munger said that he was inspired to get involved in politics by the economic problems caused by over-logging in northern Minne- sota. He said that his grandfather, who was aRep. Willard Munger . . . Pioneer in environmental legislation turns 87 years old Rep. Willard Munger, right , the longest-serving member of the Minnesota House, enjoyed a piece of his 87th birthday cake Jan. 20, as his daughter, Pat Lahr, talks with House Majority Leader Ted Winter during a reception in the House retiring room. logger and an environmentalist, encouraged him to pursue politics. \"My grandpa used to tell me, 'Willard, it's no use talkin' about it. You've got to get elected. You can talk about it 'til the cows come home, but you can't do a thing about it until you get in the Legislature,'\" Munger said. He said that he recently had a physical and with his clean bill of health he plans to offi- cially announce that he will run for re-election again this fall. Munger suffered the loss of his wife, Frances, in November 1997, an event that he said factored into his decision to run again in 1998.\"If my wife had lived, I would have consid- ered not running,\" he said, \"but she always wanted me to run again. It was one of the last things she said to me.\" Munger must remain in office through 2001 to break the record for most years served in the Minnesota Legislature, including service in both the House and the Senate. This record is currently shared by former legislators Carl M. Iverson, Anton J. Rockne, and Donald O. Wright, each with 44 years of combined ser- vice in both bodies.

C. Elmer Anderson, died on Thursday, Jan. 22, 1998, at the age of 85. Not to be confused with two other governor Andersons (Elmer L. and Wendell R.) in recent decades, C. Elmer came to publicoffice when he was only 26 years old as the lieutenant governor to31-year-old Gov. Harold Stassen. When Stassen and Anderson took office in 1939, the two were the considered \"boy wonders\" of the statehouse. Anderson's political career began as the chair of the Young Republican League at the age of 24. He made his first trip to thestate Capitol when he came to St. Paul to be sworn in as lieutenantgovernor. Clyde Elmer Anderson was born in Brainerd, Minn., on March 16, 1912, the seventh of nine children and son of Swedish immigrants. He began school in the second grade, passeda high school entrance examination after grade seven, and skipped eighth grade. Earlier, Anderson carried newspapers, worked on a farm, and worked for a news and magazine distribution center. Some time later, he bought the newspaper company andowned it for 26 years. Anderson served with Stassen for two terms, but in 1942, the governor endorsed Edward J. Thye, from Northfield to run as lieutenant governor. Stassen had already decided toresign after he was re-elected, and then join the U.S. Navy to fight in World War II. Thye defeated Anderson, serving as lieutenant governor for only three months before becoming the state's new chief executive. Anderson ran again for the office in 1944 and won. He won again in 1946 and 1948, serving for a total of 11 nonconsecutive years \u2014 unmatched by any other lieutenantgovernor before or since. In this role, he served as the presiding officer of the Senate.Serving as lieutenant governor in 1951, Anderson moved up to become the state's 31stgovernor after Gov. Luther Youngdahl resigned. In 1952, Anderson defeated DFL candidate Orville Freeman by amassing 785,125 votes \u2014 more votes than any other governor before him. Anderson completed a full two-yearterm as governor and left office after losing the November 1954 election to Freeman. Anderson is remembered by some for a directive he once made to the Legislature as chief executive. He convinced the Legislature not to hide the clock to stretch the final day of thesession. Covering the clock is no longer a procedure, but it did occur commonly back then.Even after Anderson's term in office and prior to the early 1970s, members often workedpast midnight to enact one last law or two on the constitutionally mandated last day of thesession. If the clock was not seen, then it was not necessary to adjourn by midnight.Anderson urged an end to the practice, and eventually it died out. Anderson is survived by his wife, Lillian, two daughters, a son, two sisters, one brother, and many friends who respected his contributions to the state. \u2014 LeClair Grier LambertGov. C. Elmer Anderson3 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Jim ThielmanUniversity of Minnesota President Mark Yudof is urging lawmakers to providethe resources to fulfill his ambitious vi- sion to link campus building improvementswith the development of vital educationalprograms. Yudof told the Higher Education Finance Division of the House Education Committeeabout his plans to spiff up most of the olderTwin Cities campus buildings. He combinedthat goal with the aim to make the universityone of the nation's top five research institu-tions. He asked lawmakers at the Jan. 26 meeting to approve his $252 million capital fundingrequest for 1998. \"Previously, 70 percent of our bonding re- quests have gone into new buildings and 30percent have gone into benefiting existingbuildings. This four-year proposal reversesthose designations,\" Yudof said. \"Seventy per-cent of the money will go into restoring thehistoric buildings on the north and south malland elsewhere, and only 30 percent of themoney will go into new buildings.\" Yudof's \"Capital Plan for the Support of Academic Programs in the 21st Century\" callsfor a total investment of $776 million duringthe next four years. The funds would be usedUniversity of Minnesota . . . Yudof details $252 million capital funding request Entering what will be his last legislative session, Gov. Arne Carlson already has calledhis support of the University's budget request\"non-negotiable.\" In a statement from the governor's office, Carlson said, \"A central principal of this ad-ministration has been to focus on quality jobsfor Minnesotans. In order to achieve that goal,you need to provide citizens with the educa- \"Seventy percent of the money will go into restoring the historic buildings on the north and south mall and elsewhere, and only 30 percent of the money will go into new buildings.\" \u2014 University of Minnesota President Mark Yudof to preserve historic areas of the universitycampuses and to modernize classroom andlab space. The $252 million request for 1998 is much more than the U of M has received in recentbonding measures. Major bonding legislationis usually passed only in even-numbered years.In 1996, $93.8 million was approved for con-struction and repairs involving the U of Msystem. In 1994, $69 million went to the uni-versity.tional opportunities needed to succeed in the working world.\" Yudof described overall themes of his plan for the university, and he emphasized preser-vation of the historical buildings and districtson campus and enhancement of the school'sacademic reputation. Under this year's bonding proposal, $70 million would be used to build the institute formolecular and cellular biology. Another $53.6million would be used to restore the Walter Library and to create a digital technologycenter and a science-engineering library in thebuilding. Also, $29.5 million would build a new sci- ence and math center on the Morris campus,upgrade the heating plant there, and makehealth and safety improvements. The Duluth campus would use $25.8 mil- lion to upgrade science labs, build a newlibrary, make code improvements and reno-vate classroom and other academic space. Yudof, in his first year as president of the university, explained how his plan differs fromrequests made by earlier administrations. \"The idea here was, in large measure, to tie renovation, to tie the bonding package to spe-cific investments in key academic programs,\"Yudof said. \"[It was] not to just fix up build-ings for their own sake, but to say, 'How doesthis advance the academic interdisciplinaryprogram of the University?' \" Yudof called the $70 million request for the molecular and cellular biology building a \"tre-mendous, tremendous investment.\" The pro-gram has been identified as the university'stop academic priority. \"If any of you are thinking of turning to an academic career,\" he told the representatives,\"this is where the big money is. These peopleare very difficult to recruit.\"The historic campus mall at the University of Minnesota would get a facelift under the $252 millionbonding proposal advanced by Mark Yudof, the school's new president.4 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998Yudof said regardless of the program, it is a struggle to pursue and retain blue-chip facultywithout first-rate facilities. \"Let me just make the case in the strongest possible terms,\" he said. \"In my judgment,many parts of this investment should havebeen made in 1987. That's one part. The sec-ond part of it is this is the critical area inscience in the coming century, and not just inmy judgment but the judgment of knowledge-able academicians across the country.\" He quoted from experts who insist there are more than 1,200 physical and psychologicaldisorders that have been tied to single genes. \"This research is absolutely critical,\" Yudof said. \"We're doing a great deal of it, and we'llbe doing more under this proposal. There aresome who think virtually every disease will beshown to have some sort of connection togenes.\" Yudof said other states that have invested in facilities and staff to conduct such research\"have profited enormously, particularly in thepharmaceutical area.\" He said Minnesota'spublic-private partnerships would benefitfrom such and investment. Yudof said the university already brings in $150 million in grant funding, mostly throughthe National Institutes of Health. He said theuniversity is thus \"not starting at ground-levelzero,\" but from a position of strength. And hesaid President Clinton has asked to increasethe federal budget in molecular and cellularbiology. \"We need to position ourselves to compete for this money,\" Yudof said. The 53-year-old former executive vice-presi- dent at the University of Texas-Austin has alsotermed the Minnesota campus one the topfive mall areas on the nation's college cam-puses. He says he is intent on preserving thehistoric value of the setting. The 11 buildings on the mall area are among the older campus structures and all need ma-jor or minor work, he said. In the revitaliza-tion process, Yudof said he wants to modifyCoffman Union and demolish the parkingramp that blocks a sweeping view fromNorthrop Memorial Auditorium to the banksof the Mississippi River. Yudof said these changes would restore the concept of renowned architect Cass Gilbert,who designed the mall in 1907. The goal is toaccomplish the work before the University's150th anniversary in 2001. The finance division took no action on the U of M's bonding proposal. The matter will beconsidered again later this session. By Matt Wetzel Gov. Arne Carlson said at the Jan. 29 installation of Chief Justice Kathleen Blatzthat she brings to the state's highest courtnot only supreme legal skills but also im-portant personal attributes. \"[She has] a sense of being the person to bring us all together. She has been given much\u2014 superb education, a superb opportunity toserve from her community \u2014 but as all trueleaders, she has paid us back,\" Carlson said inremarks at the swearing-in ceremony at theLandmark Center in St. Paul. Blatz, 43, Bloomington, a former mem- ber of the House of Representatives andnow a justice on the Minnesota SupremeCourt, was sworn in by outgoing ChiefJustice A.M. (Sandy) Keith. She becomesthe 19th chief justice of the Minnesota Su-preme Court. \"It's with extreme gratitude I stand be- fore you today. The journey of life is not ajourney traveledalone,\" she said. Also in attendance was her husband, TomBerkelman, her sons,Hunter, Carter andMax, several Minnesotalegislators, and judgesfrom both the federaland state level. Blatz said a judge's responsibility is notonly listening to testi-mony, studying prece-dents, and then ruling,but serving on panels,on task forces, and inother roles that canhelp people and, ulti-mately, society. \"A judge can reach out to the community and prevent bad things from happening.That's a judge's responsibility,\" she said.Blatz said she found her work on a taskforce that addressed Fetal Alcohol Syn-drome to be very rewarding. A native of Bloomington, Blatz was in the Legislature from 1978 to 1994, and as alawmaker, she built a reputation for leader-ship on family and children's issues. She worked closely with current House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), and the two were first elected inthe same year. Sviggum was on hand forthe swearing-in.Chief Justice Kathleen Blatzserved House from '78 to '94 \"I felt proud for Kathleen,\" he said. \"I'm comfortable that a person of her qualitywill be heading to the Supreme Court,whether it's family issues or getting toughon crime. I know she's a dear friend, ex-tremely talented, and well-qualified.\" Blatz holds a master's degree in social work, and she graduated from the University ofMinnesota Law School in 1984. She served inthe Legislature and worked as an attorneyand as a prosecutor until 1994, when Carlsonappointed her as a judge in the Fourth Judi-cial District Court, which includes HennepinCounty. She married Berkelman in 1984, and Berkelman, who now works for AT&T,spent seven years in the House as a DFLerfrom Duluth. Blatz's father is Jerome Blatz,a longtime state senator from Bloomington.He provided the family Bible used to swearin Blatz. She said a major difference between be- ing a legislator and being a judge is the feedback sought from the public in eachposition. \"When I was a legislator, you could go out and you could be asked several ques-tions. You are expected to take a position.That's what voters expect,\" she said. However, a judge cannot take a position until it's time to rule on a case, and thatposition must be based on the law, not onpersonal preference, she said, and she triesto explain that when she talks to peopleabout the law and being a judge.

Arne Carlson has recommended that $1.2 million be spent to pay for a genericenvironmental impact statement (GEIS) foranimal feedlots to assess their impact, both onthe economy and on the environment. Carlson's plan was discussed Jan. 26 in a meeting of the House Agriculture Committee. Feedlots have become a critical agriculture issue in rural Minnesota, because they havegrown in size, and they are unpopular withsome rural residents. Many are afraid of what the large corporate farms containing large feedlots will do to fam-ily farmers. Concern also is focused on whatthe sometimes-noxious odors that emanatefrom the feedlots will do to the health of thepeople living nearby. Each of the estimated 45,000 to 55,000 feed- lots in the state produces millions of gallons ofmanure that has to be taken care of, and criticsworry that earth-walled basins that hold thewaste leak and may eventually burst. \"The hope is the GEIS will help all inter- ested groups sift through the controversy and,hopefully, together develop plans for animalagriculture into the 21st century,\" said SusanSchmidt, policy liaison for the Minnesota Pol-lution Control Agency (MPCA). The first step is to develop an \"inventory\" of feedlots, according to the recommendationwhich is part of the governor's 1998 supple-mental budget. The project would be managed by the MPCA, the Environmental Quality Board, theDepartment of Agriculture, and the Depart-ment of Health. The GEIS would outline the types and loca- tions of the feedlots, describe the overall char-acteristics of animal farming in the state, andassess the impact on air and water. The studyalso would describe the related economic is-sues and trends. The governor hopes the long-term impact is that people will use the GEIS to develop andrevise land-use plans and that state agenciesand counties will use the findings to make orchange laws based on the potential risks topeople's health and the environment. The GEIS will cost $2.3 million and take up to two-and-a-half years to complete, saidSchmidt. Permitting for new feedlots would continue while the GEIS is conducted. The committee took no action on the mat- ter, and testimony on the plan is expected tocontinue this session. ATM transaction fees A bill that would eliminate transaction fees assessed by banks on automatic teller ma-chines (ATMs) they own met opposition fromthe banking industry during a Jan. 28 hearingbefore a House panel. HF2292, sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), would prevent banks thatown and operate more than two ATMs fromassessing a surcharge for use of the machines. The bill was debated by the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, whichAnderson chairs. The committee took no ac-tion on the bill, but the matter is expected tocome up again this session. ATM users often are hit with two fees for each transaction. One fee is assessed by theirbank; the other is by the bank that owns themachine. Anderson's bill would address onlythe fee from the bank that owns the ATM.That fee usually comes in the form of a charge at the time of a transaction at an ATMthat is not owned by the consumer's banknetwork. Consumers are warned by the ma-chine that they will be charged a certain feeand are given the option to discontinue thetransaction. Consumers often find a separate fee as- sessed at the end of the month on their bankstatement. \"I don't like to be charged twice for the same transaction. By the way, the chair usesATMs all the time,\" Anderson said. Speaking in favor of the bill was Lea Schuster, a consumer advocate for the Minnesota Pub-lic Interest Research Group. Banks have en-couraged the use of ATMs, Schuster said,because they are cheaper for banks than pay-ing tellers. One group hit hard by the surcharges are college students who often have to work andstudy beyond bank hours, Schuster said. Andfor that, they get hit with costly ATM sur-charges. \"In today's economy, students are needing to pay cash. [They] should have the sameaccess to the same services as all consumers,\"she said. Schuster also said ATM owners are com- pensated by the consumer's bank with an \"in- Rod Nelson, president of First American Bank in Crookston, Minn., testifies against a bill that wouldprohibit certain types of fees charged for the use of automated teller machines. Joining him to testifybefore the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee Jan. 28, is Joan Archer, right , vice president of governmental relations for the Minnesota Bankers Association.6 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998BUDGETterchange fee,\" so the fee charged by the ATM owner is unnecessary. The attorney general is supporting the bill. Eric Swanson, of the attorney general's con-sumer enforcement division, said the state'sthree largest banks own most of the ATMs.Customers of those large banks are not chargedfor use of ATMs owned by their bank. What could happen, Swanson said, is that people may move their business to those largebanks to avoid the ATM surcharges. Thatwould be anti-competitive, he added. \"We're opposed to price gouging and anti- competitive behavior, which is going to hurtconsumers,\" Swanson said. Critics of the bill said it could reduce the availability of ATMs and hurt competitive-ness in the banking business. Rep. Torrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake) said a $1 fee for an ATM transaction is not out ofline. \"If you go to TCF with a check and ask them to cash it, either they would charge you asubstantial fee or they would not cash it,\" hesaid. Joan Archer, of the Minnesota Bankers' Association, said the Legislature should notinterfere with bank pricing. ATMs are a con-venience that are paid for by user fees, she said. Archer also said the legislation is unfair because it targets only banks, not retailers. Insome cases, ATMs are owned by retailers. John Corbett, of the Minnesota Savings League, which represents community banks,also expressed opposition to the bill. \"What you're paying for is the convenience of havingyour money transferred to another bank soyou can have access to it,\" he said. \"Fees areone way to generate a profit. We are better offwith financial institutions that make a profit.\" Budget resolution approved The House Ways and Means Committee approved a budget resolution Jan. 27 that callsfor a maximum of $1.36 billion in new appro-priations for the 1998-1999 biennium. The $1.36 billion figure is the total amount of general fund money that is available to theLegislature this year for any purpose, whetherit's new spending, tax relief, or new reserves. Some of the money is already earmarked for specific programs. According to legislationenacted in 1997, education tax credits andsome property tax reform measures were con-tingent on a surplus in the Department ofFinance's November 1997 forecast. To arrive at the $1.36 billion figure, the committee added the projected $1.33 billionbudget surplus to the $32 million that was an end-of-session balance from 1997. There's a story behind that $32 million. The majority of the leftovers, $24.5 million, can beattributed to the governor's veto of the attor-ney general's office operating budget for 1999.The governor is now recommending to givethe attorney general's office $22.5 million inhis most recent budget proposal. At the beginning of each session, the gover- nor proposes a budget to the Legislature. Es-sentially, the governor sets the terms of thebudget debate and then the Legislature re-sponds according to its wishes. This year, the governor and the Legislature seem to be in agreement on the desired level oftotal spending. The governor wants to use the projected $1.3 billion surplus for $373 million in newspending, $841 million in property tax rebatesand rate reductions and tax breaks for educa-tion expenses, and $207 million for a so-called\"Asian market fund\" to brace for potentialfallout from instability in Asian stock mar-kets. Due to a desire to protect against any future economic downturn, the committee's resolu-tion contains a clause that allows them, ifneeded, to revisit the budget resolution afterthe February 1998 forecast. The Departmentof Finance has announced that the Februaryforecast will be available to the committeeFeb. 27. CHILDREN Child care challenges Can I get it? Can I afford it? Can I trust it? These are the three questions a parent askswhen it comes to child care, according to Rep.Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood). Slawik is sponsoring a comprehensive child- care bill ( HF2459 ) that was discussed by the Family and Early Childhood Education Fi-nance Division of the House Education Com-mittee Jan. 28. \"There are three challenges in child care: avail- ability, affordability, and quality,\" she said. The panel also discussed another bill (HF2283 ), sponsored by Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington), that aims to make morechild care available during hours beyond theusual working day. The bill calls for grants togo to referral services for recruiting such after-hours providers. Slawik said three out of four women with a child under the age of six are in the workplace.The number of parents seeking child care isprojected to increase dramatically with newwelfare reforms. Louis Alemayehu, project director of CulturalBeginnings, testifies before the House Family andEarly Childhood Education Finance Division Jan.28 in favor of a bill for quality child care. Alemayehustressed the need for children to be exposed tochild care that suits their particular culturalheritage.Recent findings about the importance of early brain development also lend credence tothe cause for better child care, she said. Slawik understands the dilemma of a work- ing parent. Her second child is almost a yearold, she said, and she agonized over findinggood child care before the legislative sessionstarted. Among the many goals of her proposal are a support system for child-care providers, in-centives for low staff turnover, outreach intocommunities of color, and a loan forgivenessprogram. Pat Gannon, of Starting Out Successfully, an Anoka County program that provides child-care operators with monthly phone contact,home visits, and training workshops, spokeabout the importance of sound business ad-vice. \"Providers are often isolated,\" Gannon said. \"Home visits give them a connection to theinfrastructure of the child care community.\" Margaret Boyer, from the Alliance of Early Childhood Professionals, addressed the rea-sons for the high rate of turnover in the field.The biggest reason, she said, is low wages.Another contributing factor is emotional ex-haustion. Child-care workers often need two jobs to7 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYsupport themselves and on top of that, she said, \"behavior management\" becomes moredifficult every day. \"There are a lot of children coming into day care whose families are very stressed and whoare not receiving good care at home,\" Boyersaid. The early childhood division took no action on the two bills, but lawmakers on the paneldid agree to form a child-care working group. CRIME DRUGS Arson data system An arson fire is reported in Minnesota every three-and-a-half hours, according to the statefire marshal. A bill approved Jan. 26 by theHouse Judiciary Committee would help in-vestigators and prosecutors by establishing astatewide database to track these crimes. \"Arson is not a free crime when it comes to human beings,\" said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of the bill. \"Firefighters risktheir lives every time they fight a fire.\" The bill ( HF2313 ) was initiated at the rec- ommendation of the Attorney General's Ar-son Task Force, which was created in 1995 todevelop methods to combat the problem ofarson in Minnesota. The task force is made upof investigators and prosecutors as well asrepresentatives of the insurance industry. Last year, the Legislature followed a task force recommendation and passed a law es-tablishing the Minnesota Arson Strike Force,a team of investigators and experts who assistlocal authorities in arson investigations. Skoglund's bill calls for the creation of an arson data system that would contain onlybasic information at the state level but wouldprovide links to local criminal justice agenciesfor more detailed information on specific cases.The database would be maintained by thestate fire marshal. The Judiciary Committee approved the bill for inclusion in the omnibus crime bill to beassembled later this session. Penalties and methamphetamine A bill that would increase the penalties for manufacturing, possessing, or selling meth-amphetamine was approved Jan. 28 by theHouse Judiciary Committee. The bill ( HF2312 ) would raise metham- phetamine to the same status as cocaine andheroin and would make the manufacture ofany amount methamphetamine a first-degreecontrolled substance offense.Law enforcement officials who testified at the committee hearing said the manufactur-ing provision is necessary because of the dan-gers inherent in the production of the drug. \"There are people involved in these opera- tions who are subject to life-threatening ac-tivities without involved,\" saidDennis Boser, sheriff of Mille Lacs County.\"December of 1996 was the first time we hadany knowledge of a meth operation in ourcounty, and that was because of an explosion.\" Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), the bill's sponsor, told the committee that the drug ismade by mixing potentially explosive materi-als and, if it's done wrong, can be extremelydangerous. \"This is a product that is different from most of the chemicals that people abuse in thatit doesn't come from across our borders,\"Skoglund said. \"People can make it in theirkitchens. And they do in this state.\" Skoglund told the committee that in Cali- fornia, a state that has seen a dramatic increasein methamphetamine trafficking, one in fivemethamphetamine production labs is discov-ered because they explode. Margaret Chutich, of the attorney general's office, compared the drug to \"moonshine\"because the ingredients can be purchased atdrug stores. \"We believe that methamphetamine is equally as harmful as cocaine, maybe morebecause of the dangers of production,\" Chutichsaid. \"They're cooking these things, and if Youth delegates vote on a bill that would create a graduated driver's license system. The youthswere part of the fourth annual Minnesota Youth Summit on Violence Prevention, a program thateducates young people about the legislative process. The students come to the Capitol for a dayto study legislation that affects young people. This year, 200 students participated in theJan. 27 event.Youth summitthey do it wrong, they're making some verydangerous gases.\" She told the committee that law enforce- ment is seeing an increase in methamphet-amine activity. She said that in 1996,methamphetamine accounted for 8 percent ofMinnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehensionlab work; in 1997, it accounted for 20 percent. Four young people from Teen Challenge, a drug treatment program, spoke to membersof the committee. The young people, whochose not to give their names, described theirexperiences as users of the drug. \"It's very easy to get,\" said a 19-year-old former user who suffered heart damage frommethamphetamine. \"It's as easy to get as mari-juana, and because I'm underage, it's easier toget than alcohol.\" A 25-year-old woman from St. Cloud, Minn. said, \"I was injecting anywhere from a gram toa half a gram every three hours. I bought acamcorder and sat in a hotel for three daysfilming outside because I thought the policewere chasing me. I thought they were hiding inthe trees.\" One of the former users told the committee that he had considered making his own meth-amphetamine to save money. \"After you use it for a while it gets expen- sive, and you think you can make your own,\"he said. The former user said he was dissuadedby a friend who told him how dangerousmanufacturing could be.

Gifted and talented students Minnesota's gifted and talented students \u2014 how much attention they need, how muchattention they're getting, and how muchmoney should be spent on them \u2014 are thefocus of two bills considered Jan. 23 by aHouse panel. During a hearing before the K-12 Educa- tion Finance Division of the House EducationCommittee, one legislator said that \"pro-foundly gifted\" students who aren't gettingthe proper challenges are being placed at-riskby the public schools. The finance division discussed two bills \u2014 HF2319 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), and HF2318 sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) \u2014 thataim to improve services for gifted and talentedstudents. No action was taken on the propos-als. Greiling's bill would expand state funding for its gifted and talented program from $1.5million in 1998 to $8.5 million in 1999, andthe bill would remove the requirement thatlocal school districts provide matching funds. Currently, districts can get state grants of $25 per student each year for local gifted andtalented instruction, but the districts have tomatch that dollar for dollar. And the funds arenot always available in a tight school districtbudget. \"We've heard from districts who didn't have time to actually apply [for the grant],\" Greilingsaid. \"Even with all the constraints, the moneywas used up last year.\" Greiling's bill also would direct the com- missioner of the Department of Children,Families and Learning to designate a specificdepartment staff member to serve schools andparents by being a resource on the gifted andtalented program. Bill Keilty, coordinator for gifted services at the Forest Lake Public Schools, said the state'scurrent program is valuable, and withGreiling's proposed changes, would be evenbetter. \"We've seen programs expand; we've seen programs that have not even existed in thepast evolve,\" he said. \"We're also very con-cerned about the need for a resource personfor gifted and talented programs.\" Keilty said the students and teachers in gifted and talented programs are frustrated by theinability to talk to someone at the state levelabout their concerns.\"Gifted programs have changed in time and are being requested to address a broader spec-trum of students,\" he said. \"The step to in-crease the funding seems appropriate.\" Leppik's bill would direct school districts to pick up the pace of instruction to high-scoringstudents in elementary and secondary grades.Schools would have to ensure gifted pupilseach have a written individual learning plandeveloped by a group that includes thestudent's teachers, parents, and counselors. The plan would state the desired outcomes for the student and the curriculum and teach-ing methods to be used. \"If they are not doing this, the students are not getting an education appropriate to theirabove-average ability and are not being servedby the school district,\" Leppik said. Gifted and talented students who are not challenged eventually run into problems, sheadded. \"They will become extremely bored; they get into trouble,\" Leppik said. Both bills were laid over for possible inclu- sion in the omnibus K-12 finance bill to beassembled later this session. School lunch program funding A proposal to increase state aid for the school lunch program stalled in the House last year,but lawmakers are considering the matteragain. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St.Paul), sponsorof HF2345 , said his bill would make up for losses due to inflation that school districtshave been forced to absorb. The Legislatureappropriates a fixed amount for school lunchand food storage aid, and that amount was lastincreased in 1991. \"As school enrollment increases, the amount available per pupil to districts decreases,\"Entenza said. His bill would increase the 1999state appropriation for school lunches from$7,254,000 to $9,035,000. Polly Podpeskar, director of food and nu- trition programs at Grand Rapids PublicSchools, testified that the program is in needof additional funding, especially consideringthe high percentage (about 33 percent) ofstudents eligible for free and reduced-pricemeals. \"We are constantly striving to strike a bal- ance between nutritious meals and ones thatare appealing to children,\" she said. \"We'revery sensitive about passing on price increasesto paying students, who are often the childrenof the working poor.\" Linda Skrian, president of the Minnesota School Food Association, said that while thenational school lunch program is often citedas one of the most successful federal pro-grams, federal funding has not been keepingpace with rising costs to districts. While the K-12 Education Finance Division of the House Education Committee did notvote on the issue during the Jan. 26 hearing,many members voiced support for the bill.9 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY\"This is one of the things that has been shown to make a difference,\" Rep. DavidTomassoni (DFL-Chisholm) said. \"We shouldreally grab it and run with it.\" The division is considering the proposal for inclusion in this year's omnibus K-12 financebill. Tax credits for education Minnesota parents whose income puts them just over the eligibility level for taking advan-tage of tax breaks in a 1997 education law mayget some good news in 1998. The House Education Committee approved a bill Jan. 27 that would replace the specificincome-level cutoff for claiming educationtax credits with a gradual phase-out of theamount of credit a family can claim. A law passed in the Legislature's 1997 First Special Session allowed families with incomesof up to $33,500 to claim up to $1,000 perchild and $2,000 per family as a tax credit foreducation-related expenses such as tutoringor educational summer camps. Families withincomes of $33,501 and higher are currentlynot eligible for any credit. \"We're doing a disservice to Minnesota families by creating a cliff,\" said Rep. Ann H.Rest (DFL-New Hope). \"We don't do this inany other tax policy that involves a credit inthis state.\" Rest is the sponsor of HF2364 , which calls for gradually phasing out the education creditfor taxpayers with incomes between $30,500and $34,500. For each $4 of income over$30,500 that a family earns, the maximumper-child credit would decrease by $1, underRest's bill. At an income level of $34,501,families would be ineligible to receive a credit. Although the bill would decrease the amount of the credit for families who earn between$30,500 and $33,500, Rest said it would \"treatMinnesota families fairly\" by eliminating thecliff effect. \"It's unfair for families to get their expecta- tions up about being able to spend extra moneyfor a child's education, only to find out they'rea few dollars over the limit,\" she said. Sheadded that an unexpected $200 bonus from aboss at the end of the year or interest from asavings account could cost families up to$2,000. But Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington) said that the proposed change would be unfairto families whose benefit would be reduced. \"The message has long been out that at $33,500 you get the full credit,\" she said.\"People may already be looking at computerpurchases or tutoring to take advantage ofthat credit.\" An amendment introduced by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) proposed to begin thephase-out at incomes of $33,500 and extend itto $37,500. Such a change would require anadditional $6.5 million from the state. The amendment was voted down by com- mittee members who said they did not want tosink more education money into what severalcalled \"inefficient and unaccountable\" taxcredits. Under Rest's bill, the state would not have to increase spending above what is anticipatedfor the current tax-credit payments. Morefamilies would be eligible for the credit, butfewer would receive the maximum amount.With the current law, about 200,000 familiesare expected to receive credits. The bill was referred to the committee's K- 12 Education Finance Division to be consid-ered for inclusion in this year's omnibus K-12funding bill. Joe Senser, a former tight end for the MinnesotaVikings, tells the K-12 Education Finance Divisionabout his positive experience growing up at theMilton Hershey Academy, a privately endowedacademy for fatherless boys in Pennsylvania. Thecommittee heard testimony on a bill Jan. 28 thatwould appropriate money to create residentialacademies for at-risk students.Residential boarding schools When former Minnesota Vikings tight end Joe Senser appeared before lawmakers Jan. 28,he assured them that \"at no time will I beasking you to build me a new stadium.\" Instead, Senser was testifying before theK-12 Education Finance Division of the House Education Committee on the merits of resi-dential boarding schools for at-risk youth. Senser attended a school for fatherless boys in Hershey, Penn., after his father died. \"My mother worked 80 hours a week, and she knew this was a way out for me, a way fora better life,\" he said. By the time he went to the school, at age 11, he said he was \"already started on that wrongpath in life. My talents . . . to play footballwould never have shown through had [I notgone to that school].\" A bill to provide $12 million to establish three such schools in Minnesota is before law-makers this session (See Session Weekly, Jan. 23, 1998, page 7). HF2321 , sponsored by Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), is being con-sidered for inclusion in the omnibus K-12finance bill. ELECTIONS Updating eligible voter lists A bill advancing in the House would pro- vide an efficient way of updating the lists ofeligible voters and might make it more conve-nient for the people who move to vote in thenext election, according to supporters. The bill ( HF2387 ), sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), would allow the sec-retary of state to periodically get names andaddresses of Minnesota registered voters whohave moved within the state and have giventhe U.S. Postal Service a change of address. The secretary of state then would provide the names to county auditors, who wouldupdate their records and send the new resi-dent a voting card with the location of theirnew polling place. The House General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and Elections Committee approvedthe bill Jan. 26. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) questioned if the bill might ask government to go too far outof its way to accommodate voters who move,when those people could easily take care of thenecessary paperwork for voting along with allof the other change-of-address paperwork. \"Isn't that my responsibility rather than having the state trying to track [me] down? Itseems like we have a good system in place,\" hesaid. \"It's a responsibility to take the time toreport that. It's that important.\" Currently, people who move have to report their change of address to the local votingauthority to get their new card. \"I don't think all citizens automatically take care of that,\" Folliard said. \"It would be aconvenience to citizens.10 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998 EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT\". . .

Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul), was laid over at the end of the1997 legislative session in part because of con-cerns that requiring such contracts would bean unmanageable burden to employers. But after hearing disturbing testimony last March from a poorly treated Spanish-speak-ing worker, several lawmakers pledged to sup-port the bill this year. The bill would expand a current disclosure law, which applies only to the meat-process-ing industry, to protect non-English speakingemployees in all jobs. It also calls for fundingfor the Department of Labor and Industry totranslate disclosure forms and to launch apublic awareness campaign. \"As a result of not understanding the terms and conditions of employment . . . Chicano-Latino People'sAffairs Council. Isabelle Martinez, who said she was unfairly fired from her job at a home for the elderly,testified through an interpreter that her em-ployer verbally misrepresented employmentterms to her in Spanish and then forced her tosign an English document that contradictedthe oral job description. Also testifying in favor of the bill were rep- resentatives from the Urban Coalition, theAFL-CIO, the Council on Black Minnesotans,and the Council on Asian-PacificMinnesotans. But officials from the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, Employment Law Council, andRetail Merchants and Employers Associationall spoke against the measure. The critics said they would support tougher penalties for employers who violate currentlaws \u2014 including one prohibiting employersfrom falsely representing job conditions orterms to prospective employees \u2014 but wereopposed to requiring written non-English contracts because of the obligation placed onemployers. \"If [employers] are already violating the law on false representation, they're probably notgoing to obey a new law requiring disclosureforms,\" said Tom Hesse, of the MinnesotaChamber of Commerce. He also noted thatMariani's bill does not provide for sanctionsagainst employers who do not provide thetranslated forms. But the committee rejected an amendment offered by Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) thatwould have eliminated the disclosure-formrequirements, increased penalties for viola-tions of relevant current laws, and kept theplan for a public-awareness campaign inMariani's bill. The bill now moves to the House Economic Development and International TradeCommittee. Minnesota Zoo faces shortfall Due to a serious shortfall in gate receipts last summer, the Minnesota Zoological Gardensis asking the Legislature for $1.5 million insupplemental funding for 1998. Don Mereen, a volunteer for the Minnesota Zoosince 1991, holds a North American opossum formembers of the House Environment, NaturalResources and Agriculture Finance Committee.Mereen and his companion were there to supportKathryn Roberts, general director of the MinnesotaZoo, who presented the agency's supplemental andcapital budget requests to the committee Jan. 27.Kathryn Roberts, the Apple Valley zoo's director, attributes the shortfall to bad luck,bad weather, and bad press. She presented thezoo's supplemental and capital budget requestsJan. 28 to the House Environment, NaturalResources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee. Roberts said 75 percent of the zoo's yearly attendance occurs between Memorial Day andLabor Day. The summer of 1997 was a disap-pointment. \"Attendance failed in the summer months,\" she said. \"No matter how well we do in thewinter months, we're unable to catch up withthose 90 days in the summer.\" In June, Roberts said, the new Discovery Bay building opened a month late facing seri-ous competition from Underwater World atthe Mall of America. Discovery Bay is a marineeducation center that features a shark exhibitand an indoor dolphin amphitheater. The zoohad been counting on a projected boost inattendance from the new exhibit, she said. To make matters worse, Roberts said, sev- eral of the sharks in the Discovery Bay exhibitdied, and the subsequent media coveragecaused people to wonder if the exhibit hadbeen closed. July brought 17 days of rain and attendance continued to lag, Roberts said. But the worst assault on attendance oc- curred in August, when an outbreak ofcryptosporidiosis struck many children whohad played in one of the zoo's fountains.Cryptosporidium is a one-celled organism thatcauses diarrhea, stomach cramps, and feverwhen it infects people. The outbreak likely wascaused by a child with a soiled diaper playingin the fountain. Roberts said the zoo endured three more weeks of bad press related to the health scare. The zoo will celebrate its 20th birthday this spring, she said, and this is the first time it hasever had to come to the Legislature for supple-mental funding to cover operating costs. Jeffrey Higgins, the zoo's financial officer, said if the zoo doesn't receive the money, itmay have to lay off 25 percent of its workforce,close several trails, and shut down the conser-vation office. The committee took no action on the mat- ter. The zoo's funding request will be consid-ered again later this session.

Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth). Munger's proposal would appropriate $500,000 to the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency (MPCA) for continued research andmonitoring of frog deformities. \"The frogs are the most sensitive of the creatures in our environment,\" Munger said.\"I think they are telling us a story.\" His bill ( HF2427 ) was approved Jan. 26 by the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee. Under the proposal, the research funding would have to be shared with several otheragencies and organizations studying the issue,including the Department of Agriculture, theDepartment of Health, the Department ofNatural Resources, the University of Minne-sota, and Hamline University. The proposed $500,000 appropriation matches the amount included in Gov. ArneCarlson's supplemental budget request. GAME & FISH Terry Fredin, of the Minnesota Frog Watch and AThousand Friends Of Frogs project at HamlineUniversity, listens as the House Environment andNatural Resources Committee approves a $500,000appropriation to continue the frog research. Theresearch project was established to discover thereason why deformed frogs have been foundaround the state. Others testifying at the Jan. 26hearing are Margaret Velky, top left , and Judy Helgen, top right , both of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and Rep. Willard Munger, sponsorof the bill.Munger said the issue is one of the governor'stop environmental concerns. The MPCA's first confirmed sighting of deformed frogs was in 1993. Interest in theissue increased after August 1995, when agroup of students from LeSueur's New Coun-try School discovered a large group of frogswith missing or deformed legs. After the stu-dents' discovery hit the press, there were simi-lar reports from across the state. Initial research was funded by the Legisla- tive Commission on Minnesota Resources incooperation with the MPCA. Research hasbeen carried out in conjunction with severalpartners, including the U of M, Hamline Uni-versity, the National Institute of Environmen-tal Health Sciences, and the National WildlifeHealth Center. The 1997 Legislature authorized an addi- tional $200,000 for further frog research. Currently, researchers are speculating that groundwater contamination or possibly ul-traviolet radiation may be the cause of thedeformities. The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency also has begun to examine theissue. \"We had better find out what's causing this environmental degradation,\" Munger said.\"Or else, we're next.\" The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Fi-nance Committee. Hunting, fishing privileges A bill that aims to amend the Minnesota Constitution to protect hunting and fishingprivileges stirred controversy Jan. 26 in theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee. Sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R- Stillwater), the bill ( HF326 ) would submit the following constitutional amendment to vot-ers in the 1998 general election: \"Shall theMinnesota Constitution be amended to de-clare a privilege of legal residents to take gameand fish in accordance with law and regula-tions?\" During the committee hearing, Holsten said, \"According to my belief system, the constitu-tion is a list of values that we, as citizens, wantto protect.\" By placing this particular privilege in the constitution, he said, the state would officiallyrecognize the \"cultural heritage\" of huntingand fishing. Members of the committee agreed to send the bill along without recommendation.Holsten sponsored a similar bill in 1996. It passed the Senate but stalled in the House thatyear, in part because of dissatisfaction with thewording of the proposed amendment. The 1996 bill sought an amendment pro- tecting the \"right\" to hunt and fish. Holsten has altered the proposed amend- ment to read \"privilege\" rather than \"right.\"He said that \"privilege\" is more accurate be-cause it implies that one still must be held tocertain standards. \"The language has evolved, and the issue has matured,\" he said. Supporters said the bill would be a first step in standing up to anti-hunting and animalrights groups who seek to curtail the activitiesof hunting and fishing enthusiasts. Jim Klatt, of the Minnesota Outdoor Heri- tage Alliance, said he is concerned about thesituation in some states with initiative andreferendum where voters have outlawed cer-tain hunting seasons and activities such assport fishing after heavy-duty campaigning byanimal rights groups. Minnesota is not an initiative and referen- dum state, but Klatt said he wants to make itdifficult for those same activists to target Min-nesota in the future. \"We are far better stewards of the land because we participate rather than watch fromafar,\" Klatt said in defense of hunters andanglers. Roger Holmes, director of the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Department of Natu-ral Resources, said the agency supports the billbecause it aims to protect hunting, fishing,and trapping. \"It also affirms the way the state regulates the harvest of our natural resources,\" he said.\"If it passed as a constitutional amendment, itmay make our jobs easier.\" Critics argued that there is no need for such an amendment and, if approved, it would onlyserve to clutter the constitution. Linda Hatfield, representing Friends of Animals and Their Environment, the NationalFund for Animals, the National Humane So-ciety of the United States, and the MinnesotaHumane Society testified against the bill. \"The constitution provides the basic frame- work for protecting basic liberties,\" she said.\"It is not intended to protect recreational pur-suits.\" Joan Harp, of rural Isanti County, said that as a landowner she is concerned about hunterswho trespass on private property. She said thelanguage may give hunters the false sense thathunting privileges take precedence over prop-erty rights. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), who chairs the committee, said that while he, too,12 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998 GOVERNMENTis a hunter and fisherman, he opposes the bill. \"I feel that it is directed against one group of citizens in Minnesota,\" he said. \"I don't relishthat particular motive.\" The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Fi-nance Committee. Tobacco investments A bill that would require the State Board of Investment to divest 5 percent of its tobaccostock sparked debate Jan. 29 on the merits ofLegislature-mandated social engineering andthe demerits of smoking. But Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), sponsor of HF2453 , said the tobacco issue is not even his top concern in the bill. His pro-posal calls for the proceeds from the sale ofthat stock to be invested in the MinnesotaTechnology Equity Fund, a program that as-sists development in rural Minnesota by offer-ing investment capital. \"It's been historically difficult for small ru- ral companies to find debt-free capital,\" hesaid in testimony before the House Govern-mental Operations Committee. \"I'm sayingthat I know of a really good use for about $15million, and I'd like to take it out of tobaccoinvestments.\" The investment board manages more than $27 billion in public money, in large part, theretirement funds for state employees, teach-ers, and public employees. Some lawmakers, including Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington), said they wouldsupport selling off the tobacco-related invest-ments, but felt it was not the job of the Legis-lature to tell the board where to relocate thefunds. But others said they supported the idea of investing in pro-Minnesota programs, but forvarying reasons, were not in favor of discrimi-nating against tobacco stocks. \"I know I was a co-author of this bill origi- nally,\" said Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City).\"But that must have been the day I quit smok-ing \u2014 I couldn't concentrate. \"It's a stupid thing to do investment-wise, when all testimony from the experts is thattobacco stocks are good investments.\" Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) said he does not want to engage in setting social policythrough legislation. \"I'm worried about our system,\" Farrell said. \"I don't really care about the invest-ment.\" Former Rep. Marc Asch testified as the vol-unteer chair of the public advocacy commit- tee of the American Heart Association's Min-nesota chapter. He called for the state to fully divest of all tobacco-related stocks, saying the drug is thenation's top killer. \"Minnesota is one of 10 states that have the most investments in tobacco,\" he said, addingthat the state has more money invested intobacco than do any of the tobacco-producingstates. The bill was sent to the committee's State Government Finance Division. An evenly divided House For the first time in its history, Minnesota may soon have a contingency plan in place forelecting a speaker in an evenly divided House. A bill that would establish a policy to be followed under such rare circumstances wasapproved Jan. 29 by the House GovernmentalOperations Committee. Across the 50 states, there have been 24 occasions when the seats in a state Senate orHouse of Representatives have been evenlydivided between two political parties. And just about every instance has yielded a different method for choosing the speaker ormajority leader. Some states deferred to thegovernor's party, while others came up withmore creative plans. (Wyoming elected to holda coin toss.) When Minnesota found itself in that posi- tion after the 1978 elections, the two partiesnegotiated a bipartisan leadership. Rep. RodSearle (IR-Waseca) became speaker, but Rep.Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) was namedchair of the powerful Rules and LegislativeAdministration Committee. Other standingcommittee chairs were selected from bothparties. \"It took an awful long time to resolve that situation,\" Anderson said. Twenty years later, the former speaker has introduced a bill that would dictate how toproceed when there is a tie vote for speaker orany other office in the House. \"I want to say that the introduction of this bill in no way indicates that I expect the Houseto be evenly divided in the near future,\" Ander-son said. Currently, DFLers hold a six-seatmajority, with elections coming up in No-vember. Under Anderson's bill, the candidate nomi- nated by the caucus of the governor's partywould be elected speaker in an evenly dividedHouse. But all committee appointments wouldthen be equally divided from each party. \"If the people of the state have spoken [and said] that they want an even distribution ofpolitical parties, we should abide by that,\" Anderson said. \"If a speaker is chosen in thismanner, then he's still not going to dominatethe House because you need 68 votes to pass abill.\" The bill now moves to the House floor. State treasurer's office Minnesotans may get the opportunity in the November polls to decide whether theoffice of state treasurer should be abolished. A bill ( HF2355 ) that would do away with the office and transfer the treasurer's respon-sibilities to the commissioner of the Depart-ment of Finance was approved by the HouseGovernmental Operations Committee Jan. 27. Bill sponsor Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL- Roseville) and co-sponsor Rep. Jim Knoblach(R-St. Cloud) said the bill's goal is to stream-line government. \"Such a statewide office should have sig- nificant policy ramifications to justify [main-taining it],\" Knoblach said. \"And we all knowthat most people don't even know who [thecurrent state treasurer] is.\" Proponents estimate that eliminating the office would save the state as much as $2.5million per year, in addition to increasingefficiency. James Dunlop, the Reform Party candidate for statetreasurer in 1998, tells the House GovernmentalOperations Committee that he would be happy tobe the last person to hold the office. Dunlop, adeputy state treasurer from 1983 to 1987, testifiedbefore the committee Jan. 27. The committeeapproved a bill that would provide a vote on aconstitutional amendment to abolish the office in2002.13 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYHIGHER EDUCATIONBut opponents, including Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington) and Rep. Tom Rukavina(DFL-Virginia), said transferring duties to thecommissioner of finance would concentratetoo much power in one department, which isunder the governor's authority. \"Does it excite anyone here to have all fi- nancial power rest on the governor?\" Knightasked. The bill calls for putting the necessary con- stitutional amendment to eliminate the officeon the November ballot, at which time voterswould also elect a final state treasurer. Theoffice would be abolished in January 2001, atthe conclusion of that officer's two-year term. Greiling said the recurring discussion of whether to eliminate the office began in the1940s. The last time the issue came before lawmak- ers was in 1996, when a bill passed the Senate54-1 but stalled in the House. That 1996 Houseproposal, also sponsored by Greiling, was ap-proved by the House Governmental Opera-tions Committee but did not come up for avote on the House floor. Greiling's current bill now moves to the House Rules and Legislative AdministrationCommittee. Honoring Nellie Stone Johnson Minnesota activist Nellie Stone Johnson may soon be honored as the first woman to have asculpture of her image displayed in the stateCapitol. It took about two minutes for the House Governmental Operations Committee to ap-prove a bill Jan. 27 that calls for a bust of thelabor organizer and civil-rights activist to beplaced in the Capitol. The same bill was passed by the House last year, but because its Senate companion stalled,the House will need to repass the bill this year. Since the 1930s, Johnson, who is now in her 90s, has been an active advocate for labor andhuman rights in Minnesota. In the early 1930s, when her wages as an elevator operator at the Minneapolis AthleticClub were slashed, she helped organize theMinneapolis Hotel and Restaurant WorkersUnion, serving as the group's first female vicepresident. A decade later, she was instrumental in orchestrating the merger of the state's Demo-cratic and Farmer-Labor parties. In 1945, shewas the first black Minneapolis resident electedto citywide office. She also helped create the office which later became the Minneapolis Civil Rights Com-mission and the state Human Rights Depart-ment; helped win desegregation of the armedforces; and was twice a representative to the Democratic National Committee in the early1980s. Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls), who is spon- soring the bill, said Johnson continues to be animportant activist. HF1583 now goes to the State Government Finance Division of the Governmental Opera-tions Committee. HEALTH Hepatitus B immunizations Vaccinating a small segment of young chil- dren could help eliminate the serious liverdisease hepatitis B, which can lead to cancer orliver failure. Dr. Deborah Wexler, executive director of the Immunization Coalition, told the HouseHealth and Human Services Committee Jan.27 that a bill to immunize the state's studentswould make Minnesota the 33rd state to enactsuch legislation. The bill ( HF2681 ) was approved and sent to the floor. Sponsored by Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL- Maplewood), the bill would require childrenenrolling in schools or child care facilities toreceive hepatitis B immunizations. The im-munization requirement would apply to kin-dergarten students beginning in the 2000-01school year. Hepatitis B is caused by a virus and spread by contact with an infected person's blood orother body fluids. It can also be spread bysharing washcloths, razors, toothbrushes, orneedles, or in the process of tattooing. Aggie Leitheiser, director of the Minnesota Health Department's Division of Disease Pre-vention and Control, said from 1990 to 1995,there were 591 known cases of hepatitis B inMinnesota, with 30 of those cases occurring inchildren 17 or younger. But she said those who suffer from the disease are often without symptoms for years,so the exact number of people carrying thedisease is unknown. Wexler said about 80 percent of infants are now being vaccinated for the disease. \"This bill just catches those kids who have fallen into the cracks. It's a checkpoint,\" shesaid. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) said the bill likely would come at no cost to the state. Need a copy of a bill?

That weather-related stress is part of the reason MnSCU is seeking $185.6 million forcapital projects this year, said Morrie Ander-son, MnSCU chancellor, during a Jan. 28 hear-ing of the Higher Education Finance Divisionof the House Education Committee. MnSCU's bonding request exceeds the $162.8 million recommended by Gov. ArneCarlson, and is nearly twice as large as in 1996,when the Legislature earmarked $86.5 millionfor MnSCU capital projects. The largest item included in the current MnSCU request is for $91 million in system-wide repair and maintenance projects. Therequest covers 335 individual projects for re-pair and replacement of buildings, equipment,and mechanical systems. The largest proposed repair and mainte- nance projects at individual schools are $16.2million at Moorhead State University, $11million at Mankato State University, and $9.6million at St. Cloud State University. The expenditures would be designated as Higher Education Asset Preservation and Re-placement (HEAPR) projects, which fit into acapital request category that includes healthand safety improvements, other projects thatupdate the exterior, interior, mechanical orelectrical systems, and other infrastructurerepair. As was the case at the division's hearing involving University of Minnesota PresidentMark Yudof earlier in the week, lawmakerswanted to ensure the funds were to be used forprojects specified under HEAPR and not fornew construction. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) wondered if the state had not been \"too loose\" in itsprevious interpretation of HEAPR projects. Moorhead State University President Roland Barden presented a detailed accountof all the school's repair needs so lawmakerscould judge the nature of the individualHEAPR requests. Barden and Anderson bothstressed that the cost to defer HEAPR projectswould exceed price of doing them now. \"We think it is important to take care of our existing asset base now,\" Anderson said. MnSCU was created in 1995 by the merger of Minnesota's technical, community, andstate colleges. The number of institutions was14 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998 reduced from 45 to the current 36, plus a campus in Akita, Japan. Members of the finance division also dis- cussed the need for an alternative to the cycli-cal need to repair flat roofs on many of theMnSCU buildings. \"It's beyond my comprehension why we build flat roofs in Minnesota,\" said Rep. GenePelowski (DFL-Winona), who chairs thehigher education panel. Robert Erickson, chair of the MnSCU facili- ties committee, said pitched roofs are moreexpensive to build and are difficult to engineeron current larger buildings. Construction ofpitched roofs requires additional support be-cause of the design and weight of the roofs, hesaid. Pelowski said the initial cost might be greater but ultimately money likely would be saved byconstructing buildings with pitched roofs. Selecting U of M regents A bill aimed at improving what many call a cumbersome and flawed process for selectingUniversity of Minnesota regents was approvedby the House Education Committee Jan. 29. Under the plan, regents for the 12-member board would be selected based on rural andurban lines rather than congressional districtlines, as they are currently chosen. Five regents would have to reside in the seven-county metropolitan area, five wouldbe required to live outside that area, and theremaining two would be at large. Currently,one regent is chosen from each of the state'seight congressional districts, and four at-largemembers are selected. Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin), sponsor of HF2741 , said the greatest benefit of the proposed change would be eliminating thedistrict caucuses from the selection process. \"The issue has been scrutinized by [mem- bers of a joint House and Senate subcommit-tees], the media, alumni, students, faculty,former candidates for regent seats,\" he said.\"It became crystal clear that the single biggestconcern was that [the process involving] con-gressional district caucuses is very time con-suming.\" The proposal also addresses an issue faced last year when the 7th Congressional Districtyielded two very desirable candidates for re-gent seats and legislators had to choose be-tween them. \"I think that almost everyone who met those candidates understood that both should havebeen on the board,\" Leighton said. \"Underthis proposal, they both could have beenelected.\" The bill also reorganizes the 24-memberRegent Candidate Advisory Committee to in- crease input from both the governor and theminority parties of the House and Senate.Currently, 12 members of that committee arechosen by the speaker of the House and 12 bythe Senate Rules Committee. The advisory committee interviews candi- dates and recommends finalists, who are thenconsidered by the House and Senate educa-tion committees. Those committees endorsecandidates before the full House and Senatevote on the finalists. Under the bill, the advisory committee would be reduced to 15 members to be chosenas follows: four each by the House speaker andthe Senate majority leader, one each by theHouse and Senate minority leaders, and threeby the governor. Typically, four regent seats come up for election in each odd-numbered year; the 12regents serve staggered six-year terms. Robert Elde plopped a Tupperware containeron the table, and quickly gained the attentionof the Higher Education Finance Division ofthe House Education Committee. Thecontainer held a human brain. It was amongthe props Elde brought to help educatecommittee members about the work done atthe University of Minnesota's College ofBiological Sciences. Elde, a neurobiologist, isthe dean of the college. Mike Martin, dean ofthe university's School of Agriculture, was laston the Jan. 26 agenda to make a pitch for hisschool. \"Following Dean Elde and his travelingbrain is a tough act for me,\" Martin said.Real brainHOUSINGLegislators next will vote on regent candidatesin 1999. The bill will move to the House floor. Housing discrimination A proposal to provide grants to help solve the problem of housing discrimination wasapproved Jan. 27 by the Housing and HousingFinance Division of the House Economic De-velopment and International Trade Commit-tee. The bill ( HF2431 ) is sponsored by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), who said thathe was motivated to action by reports of hous-ing discrimination in his legislative district. The bill would provide $400,000 in grants to nonprofit organizations experienced inhousing issues to deal with the problem ofhousing discrimination. The grants could beused to provide investigative and legal servicesto victims of discrimination or for fair hous-ing testing and education. Lawrence Winans, director of the Minne- sota Fair Housing Center, testified in supportof the bill. His organization does audits oflandlords and property managers to studyways in which discrimination occurs. \"Discrimination in the field of housing is never blatant,\" he said. \"A person does notcome to the door and say, 'I do not rent toblack people,' or 'I don't rent to Hispanics.'\" Christy Snow, who is the testing coordina- tor with the Fair Housing Center, describedhow audits are done. Two testers are sent to ahousing agent. Both testers have the samescripted characteristics, such as income statusand rental history, but differ on the character-istic being tested, most often race. Larry Haqq and Shalia Lindsey, both testers who are African-American, read audit tran-scripts of exchanges they had with landlords.Snow read transcripts provided by white testersto show the differences in the behavior of thehousing agents. In one case, Lindsey said, she was asked to leave her driver's license in the rental office,and she was told it was necessary so that theproperty manager would have her identifica-tion in case something happened during thetour. A white tester with the same qualifica-tions did not receive the same request. \"In one out of two audits, the person of color is treated less favorably than the personwho is white,\" Snow said. \"While neither testerwas told they would not be welcome, the evi-dence is there that the African-American testersreceived different treatment.\" The fair housing grants would be distrib-15 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYuted by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The bill now goes to the full committee. HUMAN SERVICES LAWHospital ownership Nonprofit hospitals are generally viewed as charitable community assets, but from 1990to 1996, a total of 192 nonprofit hospitalsconverted to for-profit status. In 1996, 60nonprofit hospitals were converted. A bill that would require nonprofit hospi- tals to provide 45 days of notice to the attorneygeneral before making transfers involving 50percent or more of hospital assets was ap-proved by the House Health and Human Ser-vices Committee Jan. 28. The bill ( HF381 ) is sponsored by Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls). It would authorizethe attorney general to make the transactionnotices accessible to the public and to obtainpublic comment on any pending transaction. While the attorney general's office already has the ability to investigate and stop suchtransactions that are not in the public interest,the bill ensures written notice would go to theattorney general's office well in advance of thedeal. Greenfield said it is easier to examine such deals before they are complete, rather than to\"unscramble the egg\" later. \"Often it's only after the deal is done that the public has any awareness that this transac-tion has taken place,\" said Cindy Jesson, of theattorney general's office. \"The public learnsafterward that maybe it was a sweetheart dealand the nonprofit seller did not get fair marketvalue for the hospital. And that's importantbecause if you get fewer dollars in the sale,then fewer dollars go into charitable truststhat help communities promote health care.\" Before California adopted similar legisla- tion, Greenfield said that state lost about $2billion in public investment. Greenfield saidthe law would help ensure that \"a publiclyowned hospital cannot just come in, take funds,and disperse them any way they want to. Theyhave a responsibility to use this money in thepublic good in the health arena.\" Greenfield also said the legislation would not prohibit companies exploring for-profitownership in Minnesota. \"It's going to make for-profits think twice, but I don't think it's a prohibition,\" he said. The bill now moves to the House Judiciary Committee.Nursing home salaries Emotional testimony accompanied a com- mittee discussion of a bill that would providea 5-percent salary adjustment to nursing facil-ity employees. Jeanette Hanson, of Stillwater, her voice tense with emotion, told of understaffing, lackof supplies, and frequent falls during hermother's 30-month stay in a nursing home. She said on the last night of her mother's life, a caring staff member gave her mother\"an old-fashioned back rub, and you couldalmost hear my mom purr.\" But Hanson saidunderstaffing precluded that type of attentionroutinely. The measure would allow certified nursing facilities to apply to the state for a 5-percentsalary adjustment for employees starting Oct.1, 1998. Low wages in the field and a generalshortage of workers in the state has made itdifficult for nursing homes to attract and re-tain workers. The House Health and Human Services Committee sent the bill ( HF2684 ), sponsored by the committee's finance divisionJan. 29. Medical malpractice lawsuits A bill to extend the time allowed to file a medical malpractice case from two years to sixyears has stalled on a tie vote. A similar bill,however, which would extend the limit incertain instances has received initial approval. Both bills were heard in the Civil and Family Law Division of the House Judiciary Commit-tee on Jan. 28. Current law requires that lawsuits dealing with medical malpractice must be initiatedwithin two years of the occurrence of themalpractice in all cases. Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) is sponsoring a bill ( HF1151 ) which would make an exception to the statute of limitations incertain instances. Troy Donahue, a member of the public, testified for Van Dellen's bill. He said that hiswife had a mole removed in 1993 and it wasmisdiagnosed as benign. By the time they dis-covered that an error had been made, thestatute of limitations had passed, and attor-neys told them that they did not have a mal-practice claim. Donahue was told that if the case had oc- curred in Wisconsin, he would still have aclaim. His wife died of cancer in 1996, a monthafter the cancer was found.\"Had this been caught at the time, maybe she'd still be alive. It's just terrible,\" he said. William Stoeri, an attorney who represents doctors in malpractice cases, spoke in opposi-tion to the bill. He said that the statute oflimitations strikes a balance between the rightsof plaintiffs and defendants. \"A statute of limitations exists because it is unfair for defendants some years down theline to come in and defend themselves,\" hesaid. Stoeri said that it is difficult to build a defense based on a doctor's memory of whathe or she did years ago. He said that they haveto go back and review the standard of carefrom the year of the claim. They have to re-search what the correct response should havebeen in order to establish that the doctor didnot act negligently. \"The difference in medical cases is that medicine advances extremely quickly. To gofrom two years to six years is an exponentialexpansion,\" he said. \"I don't think that anypatient would want to be treated with thestandard of care from six or eight years ago.\" Bob Tracy, of the Minnesota AIDS project, testified against one of the provisions inHF1151 . The provision would extend the stat- ute of limitations in cases where the HIV virusis passed from a health care worker to apatient. Tracy said that there have been no cases of this sort in the state. He said that there has onlybeen one case in the United States, and thatcase has been recently called into question. \"Particularly with the HIV provision, we are looking at a solution that is trying to finda problem,\" he said. Van Dellen's bill received the division's ap- proval and now goes to the full committee. The division also heard a bill ( HF2491 ) sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) that would increase the statute oflimitations to six years for all medical mal-practice cases. When the bill came up for a vote, there was a tie, and the bill did not advance. Making health care decisions Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) told the House Judiciary Committee Jan. 28 why he issponsoring a bill to rework legislation he helpedwrite dealing with durable power of attorneyand living wills. \"I had the unique opportunity as the author of a bill to go to my attorney with estateplanning issues and have my own lawyer say,'You know what? I don't like your durablepower of attorney law, and if you don't like16 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998that, find another lawyer,'\" Bishop said, whose bill was approved by the committee. HF2521 is based on the recommendations of a working group the Minnesota State BarAssociation sponsored to review current lawon health care decision-making and to suggestways to make the laws more effective. Thegroup is made up of government officials andrepresentatives from health care organizations,consumer groups, and ethical and religiousorganizations. Currently, a patient can create a document that designates the care to be received if he orshe cannot communicate those wishes. Thedocument is called a living will. In addition, apatient can name a person as his or her du-rable power of attorney, which authorizes thatperson to make health care decisions. Theliving will and durable power of attorney pro-visions are contained in two separate statutes. \"What we now have as a result is too confus- ing, and lawyers are choosing one or the other,\"Bishop said. The bill would combine the living will and the durable power of attorney into one docu-ment called a health care directive. The billprovides the criteria necessary for a directiveto be valid and directs the commissioner ofhealth to appoint an advisory task force tocreate a uniform health care directive form. Barbara Blumer, an attorney from the work- ing group, said the convenience of the newlanguage would encourage all people to makedecisions about their health care before it istoo late. \"Our goal is to give Minnesotans a tool to express their wishes on health care decisions,\"Blumer said. \"This is a bill for young and oldMinnesotans; it's a bill for all Minnesotans.\" Helen Johnston from the Minnesota Board on Aging testified for the bill. She told thecommittee that last week a 97-year-old friendof hers was given medical treatment and thatthere were questions about whether the treat-ment was consistent with the friend's wishes. Johnston said if her friend had a heath care directive on file with the doctor, the situationcould have been avoided. Jackie Schwietz, a lobbyist for the Minne- sota Citizens Concerned for Life, told the com-mittee that her organization has objections tothe bill, especially a provision recognizing liv-ing wills from other states. She said if doctor-assisted suicide is made legal in other states,those living will documents may have to behonored in Minnesota. The bill now moves to the House floor.LOCAL GOVERNMENT METRO AFFAIRSWar against mosquitoes The Metropolitan Mosquito Control Dis- trict would have to let affected communitiesknow when the agency's soldiers are comingwith their pickup trucks and their chemicalsprayers to wage war against mosquitoes, un-der a bill sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling(DFL-Roseville). The bill ( HF2320 ) was considered Jan. 27 by the House Local Government and Metro-politan Affairs Committee. It would requiremosquito control to notify the local residents,affected property owners, and local govern-ment units before spraying mosquito-killingchemicals. \"The mosquito control district claims that everything they use is very safe,\" Greiling said.\"Over time in history, there have been chemi-cals that people thought were safe, and wefound out they're not so safe.\" The bill would require mosquito control to provide a minimum 48-hour notification be-fore an insecticide treatment on public land orwater by posting signs. And the bill would require a minimum 48- hour notice when the spraying will be within300 feet of farmland or within 1,000 feet of ahome. That notification must be made in per-son or in the form of an information card onthe door at each residence. The bill also would require a notice of seven to 14 days to any city or town where sprayingwould occur within its limits. Judy Bellairs, legislative director for the Si- erra Club, told the committee of an experiencelast summer when a spraying truck from mos-quito control came into her neighborhoodemitting a fine mist which seemed to have anoily smell. No one knew the truck was coming. \"People cannot object if they do not know when their property is being sprayed,\" shesaid. The spray was made up primarily of chemi- cals that are toxic to fish and other forms ofaquatic life, she said. She also questioned the effects of residue left in the area. \"People who are chemically sensitiveshould know about the spraying,\" she said, ac-knowledging that mosquito control has a hotlinewith updates on spraying. \"People don't know about the hotline,\" she said. Some committee members wondered if the bill might become another \"unfunded man-date\" handed down from the state. Washington County Commissioner Dave Engstrom said it would, but that that's part ofdoing business.\"We in local government look at anything as unfunded, but we do them. I think it's reallycritical to know what kind of environment[homeowners] are getting into,\" he said. Joe Sanzone, director of the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District, said the districttries to \"conduct a proactive notification pro-gram. We are open to change and to improvethe way we do it.\" The bill, which was laid over, is expected to be taken up again later. Trolley for tourists A plan to promote south Minneapolis neigh- borhoods with a trolley to transport touriststo the area rolled easily through the HouseEconomic Development and InternationalTrade Committee Jan. 28. HF2339 , sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), calls for developing a transit sys-tem to connect the Minneapolis ConventionCenter with the Cedar-Riverside, Central,Phillips, Powderhorn, and Whittier neigh-borhoods in Minneapolis. \"This is a whole undiscovered part of the city that both tourists and residents don't patronize or know about,\" Clark said. She said the neighborhoods are full of ethnic restau-rants and shops but the lack of accessibilitykeeps tourists away. \"By bringing some of the tourism into south Minneapolis, we generate added revenue forthe state,\" she said. The bill calls for $400,000 for planning and operational costs for starting the program andanother $40,000 for promotional costs. Thosefunds would be expected to be matched bysources such as the city of Minneapolis,Hennepin County, and private businesses. Aseparate bill requests bonding for buying thebuses. The project is slated to include regular routes between the convention center andother areas, as well as chartered routes. \"This is a good investment in our economic development and in our inner city,\" Clarksaid. \"It's the first attempt to develop inner-city tourism in Minneapolis.\" Several lawmakers at the hearing said they used to live or work in some of the neighbor-hoods in question and are in favor of develop-ment efforts. \"I always got the feeling that this was one of those neighborhoods that could just tip eitherway,\" said Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul),who used to work in south Minneapolis. The bill now moves to the committee's Eco- nomic Development Finance Division.17 January 30, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Nicole Wood In an effort to return some of the state's budget surplus \u2014then projected at a hefty $2.3billion \u2014 to homeowners andrenters, the 1997 Legislature authorized a one-time property tax rebate. Now it's time to collect on the budget wind- fall, but questions about eligibility and filingprocedures abound. To qualify for the rebate, homeowners must have paid 1997 property taxes on a homesteadthat was their principal residence. The taxesmay have been paid directly, indirectly throughan escrow arrangement with a mortgage lender,or under a purchase agreement for theproperty. Likewise, renters must have paid rent in 1997 on a dwelling that was their principalresidence. The rebate amounts to 20 percent of prop- erty taxes paid for homeowners. Renters willbe able to get a rebate of 3.6 percent of the rentthey paid in 1997. That's about 20 percent ofthe estimated portion of rent that pays prop-erty taxes, according to the Minnesota De-partment of Revenue. There is no dollar cap on the rebate, and its availability does not depend on income. Here'sthe tricky part: Although it is a property tax rebate, it must beclaimed on the 1997state income tax re- turns filed in 1998. Therebate is essentially arefundable creditagainst the state in-come tax. The revenue depart- ment estimates thatthe rebate will cost thestate $500 million. Average individual rebatesare expected to be $300 for homeowners and$175 for renters. To collect the rebate, homeowners and rent- ers \u2014 even those who are normally exempt fromfiling income taxes \u2014 must file Minnesota'sindividual income tax Form M-1. In an attempt to make Form M-1's rebate section easy to identify, the companion book-lets to Form M-1 have been updated with theslogan \"Look for the Frog.\" The revenue department has added a smil- ing frog symbol on Form M-1 that clearlymarks the rebate section. It's a play on wordsthat only an accountant could love. Get it? Afrog says \"rebate, rebate.\"Rebate '98 . . . Homeowners, renters collect on budget windfall Homeowners will need their property tax statements issued by counties in 1997. A copyof the statement will have to be attached to thetax form to receive the rebate. Landlords must supply renters with the documentation they will need to claim therebate. The paperwork should be in the handsof renters before the end of January. A rebate schedule on the back of the form details eligibility requirements. Many collegestudents will be disappointed to read the fineprint; renters who are listed as dependents onanother person's income tax return do notqualify for the rebate. At the moment, those who prepaid their 1997 property taxes in 1996 do not qualify,either. The law states that the rebate is basedon a \"percent of qualified property tax paid in calendar year 1997.\" However, things could change for those who prepaid in 1996. The House Taxes Com-mittee has approved a bill, HF2294 , that would grant the rebate to early birds, too. The bill isheaded for a vote on the House floor. In the past, income tax refunds took any- where from three weeks to two months toreceive, depending upon when they were filed. This year, the revenue department predicts that refunds may take twice as long \u2014 up tofour months \u2014 because they expect to process an additional 600,000refunds more than the1.2 million refundshandled last year. It's a good idea to file early, and it'san even better idea todo so electronically.By electronic filing,the figures are auto-matically transferred to the department's computer system, savingtedious data entry time and accelerating therate of return. In fact, electronic filers who arrange for direct deposit can expect a refund within10 days. For more information, contact the Depart- ment of Revenue Taxpayer Hotline at 296-3781 (Metro) or 1-800-652-9094 (GreaterMinnesota), or to catch a bright green ani-mated version of the rebate frog in action, visitthe department's web page:www.taxes.state.mn.us . The property tax rebate approved by lawmakers will return an average of $300 to homeowners and $175 to renters.Here are some hints for completing thepaperwork necessary to get the money. Homeowners will find the qualifying amount of property taxes paid indicatedon Line 1 of the 1997 property tax state-ment issued by counties last year.Homeowners who have misplaced thestatement should call their countytreasurer's office for a new copy. Prop-erty tax statement stubs and Truth inTaxation statements are not acceptablesubstitutes. To calculate the rebate, homeowners should multiply the figure on Line 1 ofthe property tax statement by 20 per-cent. Renters will get the paperwork they need from their landlord. Landlords mustpresent renters with two copies of a 1997Certificate of Rent Paid (CRP) no laterthan January 31, 1998. Line 1 of the CRPindicates the total amount of rent paidlast year. To calculate the rebate, rentersshould multiply the figure on Line 1 ofthe CRP by 3.6 percent. Why 3.6 percent and not 20 percent? For renters, the rebate equals 20 per-cent of \"rent constituting propertytaxes,\" or the portion of rent that coversproperty taxes. After calculating the rebate amount, there are three easy steps to completethe rebate section of Form M-1: 1) Check the homeowner or renter box on Line 14 (Look for the frog!) 2) Fill in the rebate amount on Line 14.3) Attach a copy of your property tax statement or CRP. The Department of Revenue expects to receive an additional 230,000 formsfrom people who are seeking the rebatebut who don't qualify to file incometaxes. People in that situation shouldwrite, \"Do not meet filing requirements- rebate only,\" at the top of Form M-1, filltheir name, address, and social securitynumber, write in \"0\" for the amount offederal taxable income on Line 1, andcomplete the rebate section on Line 14.How to do the paperwork for your property tax rebate The Minnesota Department of Revenue has addedthis frog symbol to the M-1 income tax form tomark the rebate section.18 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998By Nicole Wood Newly elected Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton) has been a Republican sinceshe was 10 years old growing up in Taft, N.D. Her political awakening occurred in 1952 when the late PresidentWilliam Taft's son, U.S.Sen. Robert Taft, camethrough town. Theyounger Taft was seek-ing the GOP nominationfor president, and he hadvowed to visit every townnamed Taft in the coun-try. Erickson's Taft was the smallest \u2014 population seven, with onesibling on the way. Dwight Eisenhower got the nod from the Republican Party and went on to win thepresidential election that year, but Taft's visithad a lasting effect on Erickson. \"That was my first real knowledge that there was a political process,\" she said. \"My parentshad already been proclaiming themselves Re-publicans, but it was my introduction to poli-tics.\" Erickson maintained her ties to the Repub- lican Party when she grew up and moved toPrinceton, Minn. Her first real campaign work,she said, was for John Zwach's congressionalcampaign in the 1960s. Zwach happens to bethe father of one of Erickson's new Housecolleagues, Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior). More recently, Erickson managed all four of former state Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer'sHouse campaigns. \"The experience of running his campaigns was absolutely essential,\" she said. \"It paid off.\"New members . . . Early Taft visit inspires Erickson's political career Erickson is quick to credit her predecessor and the supporters they had gathered over theyears for their assistance in what was a whirl-wind campaign \u2014 she had less than a monthto get organized and to campaign before theJan. 6 special election. \"I spent my holiday door knocking,\" Erickson said. The decision to run for the District 17A House seat was by no means an easy one,Erickson said, because of her commitment toPrinceton High School, where she teachesEnglish, advises the school newspaper, andoversees the yearbook staff. She has taken a leave of absence, she said, but with so many responsibilities, it has beendifficult for her to wrap up things at the highschool. \"It has been my life to teach, and I love it,\" she said. \"I teach with a passion.\" Rep. Erickson brings this enthusiasm for teaching to the House Education Committee,where she hopes to continue down the pathtoward increased accountability and empha-sis on outcomes. \"It's so important, having been in the class- room for 30 years, that we all know, whetherwe're teachers, parents, or communities, thatour children are learning something that theycan take with them in life,\" she said. \"Thecommunity at large has found out in employ-ing and further educating our students thatthey are not at the standard they expect. Thus,we started this reformation.\" Erickson's legislative agenda isn't limited to education. She also serves on the RegulatedIndustries and Energy Committee and theEconomic Development and InternationalTrade Committee and its Housing and Hous- ing Finance Division. In language typical of a teacher, Erickson said she did her \"homework\" immediately after theelection, and already she is sponsoring severalbills. She hopes to address other key legislativetopics, such as animal feedlots, soon. Erickson adamantly opposes a proposed moratorium on feedlots in the state. \"I don't want to see the family farmer face another roadblock,\" she said. She also has definite ideas about what to do with the state's projected $1.3 billion budgetsurplus. \"I would like to see the surplus given back to the people,\" she said. \"That means propertytax reform and possible income tax reform.\" Erickson said she comes from a \"property poor\" district. \"Property tax reform is major in District 17A because we have little to no industry, alow tax base, and a lot of land that is tax-freebecause it is a reservation,\" she said. \"I wouldhope that eventually the Legislature wouldunderstand that there are some districts thatface that dilemma.\" Rep.

But the trouble with sto- ries, says cultural anthro-pologist Jennifer James, isthat too many of us don'trecognize when our favoriteones have grown stale. \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a prime example,\" James told a group of lawmakers at the MinnesotaHistory Center Jan. 28. \"It took such a longtime for people to even see that story. Most ofus have walked by alcohol for our whole lives,but despite all the evidence, we were unwillingto believe it could be as damaging as mari-juana [or] cocaine.\" The reason, she said, is that people were too comfortable with the old story of alcohol as arelatively safe drug. \"It's not the evidence or the data that makes a difference, but how long we've been tellingourselves the story,\" she said. \"There's noth-ing more painful than having your story in-validated.\" James was addressing legislators and their staff as the second of two speakers in this year'sCapitol Forum Series, sponsored by theMcKnight Foundation and Minnesota Tech-nology Inc. She is a Seattle-based lecturer, writer, com- mentator, and former professor of psychiatry.Her books include Thinking in the Future Tense and Success is the Quality of Your Journey . Her message to lawmakers was clear: Those who get stuck clinging to the parameters of oldstories will be left in the dust. \"The key way to have influence is to be able to tell a compelling new story about the waythings are or should be,\" she advised. It's the speed at which society is changing that makes the invention of those new storiesso difficult, she said. One of the more compelling stories this decade, according to James, is welfare reform. \"Under the guise of welfare reform we have one of the most compassionate moves oursociety has made,\" she said. \"Liberals are go-ing crazy because the story they've been tellingforever is changing.\" But changing the welfare system, she insists, is a giant step forward. \"We finally understand in this increasingly sophisticated world that it is unacceptable tobuy off a portion of society and move them tothe side,\" she said. \"We finally have to say thatwe do want these people in our society.\"Capitol Forum Series . . . Jennifer James: 'Our favorite stories have grown stale' But while she praised the instigators of wel- fare reform as visionaries, she said there aremany times in government when legislatorsneed to stand back while the story writes itself. In Minnesota, she said, the current pro- posal for hunting and fishing rights falls underthat category. \"Give them the constitutional amendment to protect hunting,\" she said. \"But understandthat in the long run it doesn't matter \u2014 thatstory is already written. \"We've had far too many bunny books in- fluencing the kids. Fourteen percent of ado-lescents claim to be vegetarian. Hunting is notin the future.\" Having grown up on a farm and lived most of her life in a hunting and logging state, Jamessays she's sympathetic to those interests, but,\"the writing is on the wall.\" \"You can make far more money by protect- ing the environment than by not [protectingit],\" she said. \"In Washington, we lose federalmoney every year for logging, which we con- tinue in order to keep people employed. \"But at what time do you start to follow the new story?\" she asked. Lawmakers said they were particularly im- pressed with James, who spoke as part of thesame series here last year, because she in-cluded so many Minnesota-specific topics inher talk. However, she said she couldn't resist shar- ing her views on the recent, widely publicizednews involving President Clinton. \"Of course we know the story we're all thinking about this week,\" she said. \"It's reallytoo soon for an anthropologist to talk about it,but heck, that'll never stop me.\" She said polls showing that women over- whelmingly support Clinton this week indi-cate that gender is rewriting its own story. \"Women have increasingly less support for stupid women, for women who are unwillingto use their education, unwilling to do thedecent thing,\" she said. \"Women [are] wakingup another notch.\" James said that in the long run the story about Monica Lewinsky and Clinton won'thave anything to do with character. \"Nobody really cares if he did it or not,\" she said. But she did draw some chuckles from the audience for her opinion on the matter. \"It's probably true, and I say that only be- cause she's his type \u2014 big hair and obviouslynot too bright,\" she said. \"But the real story tocome out of this will be that you can't have aprivate investigator pursuing your president.\" She left the audience with some thoughts on how the story of lawmakers is being rewritten. \"The ways we divide politicians are becom- ing increasingly ineffective,\" she said, usingherself as an example of the new constituent:fiscally conservative, but socially liberal. She said leaders are having to address these new constituents. \"We're looking at a public that's going to make it increasingly difficult to hold leader-ship positions for a long time if there's nosubstance,\" she said. At a reception following the talk, lawmakers said they found the evening inspirational. \"She really does stretch us and make us think,\" Rep. Gail Skare (DFL-Bemidji) said.\"Unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't take longfor us to slip back into the old routine.\" Dr. Jennifer James, cultural anthropologist,presents her perspectives on public policy issues.James lectured at the Minnesota History CenterJan. 28 as part of the 1998 Capitol Forum Series.20 SESSION WEEKLY / January 30, 1998In the Hopper . . .

Former Minnesota Viking safety Paul Krause, now a Dakota County commissioner,attended the meeting.

We do that with bathrooms.\"Is there a difference between a men's soccerfield and a women's soccer field?\" he asked. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) an- swered, \"It's pink.\"Morrie Anderson, chancellor of the Min- nesota State College and University System,began the Jan. 28 meeting of the Higher Edu-cation Finance Division of the House Educa-tion Committee by congratulating the chair. Anderson told Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL- Winona), who is rather strict about startinghearings on time, that \"House time is muchbetter than Senate time.\" \"Chancellor,\" Pelowski said, \"I think you'll find the House bills are much better, too.\" If you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.HF3000-HF3088 were not availableat press time.

Oct. 1, 199782% is state's high-techworkers earn about 50percent more than their lower-tech counterparts, according to arecent report by the American Electron-ics Association. But that's not to say that high-tech workers in Minnesota are on top of theemployment barrel: The same reportshows that the wages earned by the state'shigh-tech employees ranked only 22nd inthe nation. The report by the country's largest high- tech trade association tracks the industry'srates of employment, salaries, and ex-ports by state from 1990 to 1995 by usingfederal labor statistics. According to the report, 55 of every 1,000 private-sector employees in theMinnesota were working in a high-techfield in 1995. Only five states had a higherratio (California, Colorado, Massachu-setts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey). While Minnesota's total population is 20th nationwide, the state came in 13thfor the number of workers employed byhigh-tech firms. Computer developing, manufacturing, and servicing accounted for almost one-half of Minnesota's 109,000 high-tech jobsin 1995, while the others were mostly intelecommunications, industrial electron-ics, and electronic-component manufac-turing for companies such as Honeywelland 3M. On average, Minnesota high-tech work- ers earned $42,618 in 1995 \u2014 far morethan the statewide average salary of$27,050. But in several other states, sala-ries for high-tech workers compared evenmore favorably with wages for the rest ofthe workforce, leaving the Minnesota witha rank of 22nd for high-tech salaries. However, Minnesota did rank high \u2014 13th \u2014 for its amount of high-tech ex-ports. In 1995, a full 53 percent of thestate's total exports were defined as high-tech. That amounted to $4.6 billion inexports.'Cyber-employment' in Minnesota Where to find information House Public Information Office 175 State Office Building(612) 296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550 This nonpartisan office provides: committee meeting schedules, legislator information; and publications, including the Session Weekly newsmagazine, educational brochures for allages, and member directories.

In Minnesota's bicameral Legislature, the constitutionally mandated \". . . message to each session of the Legislature . . .\" becomes a joint meeting of 201 members, with both thespeaker of the House and the president of the Senate presiding. The governor, otherconstitutional officers, and judges are invited guests. Protocol dictates that on the day of the governor's speech, around 11:45 a.m., senators, led by their chief sergeant-at-arms, and other officials are escorted to the House chamberby designated legislators and by representatives of the military. The House chief sergeant-at-arms announces each arrival, then is given permission by the speaker for the guests to enter the chamber. The governor is the last dignitary to enter,and begins the message promptly at noon. Gov. Henry H. Sibley, the state's first chief executive, and the six governors who served over the next 21 years gave an annual address during each year of their two-year terms inoffice. Legislators met on an annual basis. From 1881 to 1971, the Legislature metbiennially, so the governor gave only a biennial report of progress in the state. Since 1973,the governor has once again reported annually to the legislators who meet each year of atwo-year session. In 1969, Gov. Harold LeVander added \"State of the State\" as the name of the official report to Minnesotans. For 140 years, most governors' messages or inaugural addresses have been given in the legislative chambers under protocol. But Gov. Rudy Perpich, in 1983, delivered a separateinaugural address at Hibbing High School. Likewise, in 1988, he had legislators and other officials load onto four buses at the Capitol, and travel 110 miles away for an evening State of the State speech at Winona StateUniversity. In 1990, Perpich's last message occurred at Bloomington Jefferson High School. His speech did not focus on the state's condition, the budget, or even revenue forecasts. The15-minute message focused on building a drug-free environment. Again breaking proto-col, the address was written by David Carr, a free-lance writer and recovering cocaineaddict. Gov. Arne Carlson made his final State of the State address on Feb. 4 in the House chamber (See related story, page 17) but his 1996 message was given to the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce at a hotel miles from the Capitol in the near southwest suburbs.A different audience. And for the first time, State of the State guests ate dinner and paid $60per person for chamber members and $80 for nonmembers. Carlson's final message to the state this week was given to a more traditional audience of legislators, state officials, school groups, and the general public. Once again, protocol prevails. \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Nicole Wood The Land of 10,000 Lakes is being overrun by 27,000 personal watercraft (PWC) opera-tors, according to supporters of a bill thatwould strictly limit use of the increasinglypopular watercraft. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) is which she has dubbed thepersonal watercraft safety and courtesy act. Lakeshore property owners, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), PWC manufac-turers, watersport enthusiasts, and othersbrought their disparate opinions on personalwatercraft to the House Environment andNatural Resources Committee Feb. 2. \"In a democracy, it is unacceptable that such a small and noisy minority have such anegative impact on others,\" Jeff Brown, ofMinnesotans for Responsible Recreation, toldthe panel.Noise on the lakes . . . resurface The bill ( HF1690 ) is Hasskamp's second attempt in as many years to \"accommodatethe reasonable rider and give everyone elsesome relief,\" she said. The committee ap-proved the bill. Among the provisions in the bill are a ban on all personal watercraft from lakes of 200acres or less in size, mandatory certificationand liability insurance, an increase in the mini-mum operator's age from 13 to 16, an ex-panded no-wake zone, and reduced hours forfull-throttle operation.Proponents of the bill said that the foremost problem with PWCs is the noise. Dr. Peter Arny, who has lived on Turtle Lake in Shoreview since 1953, said he has stoppedfishing because of the PWC noise which hedescribed as analogous to swarming bees. \"It's incessant. It drives you inside,\" he said. \"People who use them should think abouthow they invade other people's privacy.\" Supporters of HF1690 also accused PWC operators of reckless disregard for boaters,swimmers, and wildlife. Helen Wilkie, representing Polaris Indus- tries, a Minnesota manufacturer of all-terrain vehicles, andpersonal watercraft, gave the industry's re-sponse to the proposed legislation. Wilkie said the real problem is a lack of enforcement of existing laws. \"Polaris is doing what [it] can to support law enforcement,\" she said, \"but chasing loons and high speeds are already illegal.\" Wilkie compared the current PWC situa- tion to the introduction of snowmobiles in the1960s. \"Controversy and conflict always surround the introduction of new and innovative prod-ucts,\" she said. Wilkie did admit that noise is a problem. She said Polaris has updated their engines andmufflers and is working on sound-deadeningmaterials.Bombardier of Canada \u2014 \"a major player in the industry\" \u2014 has introduced a PWC thatreduces noise by 50 percent, Wilkie said, andthe rest of the industry is close on Bombardier'sheels. Wilkie said while Polaris supports \"user- friendly\" education and an age requirement,they do not agree with the proposed ban onlakes up to 200 acres. \"Should people who are fortunate enough to own lakeshore property have the ability toban something on public waters simply be-cause they don't like it?\" she asked. Well-known Twin Cities businessman Irwin Jacobs was among those who stepped up totestify in favor of the bill. Jacobs is the chair ofGenmar Holdings Inc., a manufacturer of sev-eral boat lines including Lund, Larson, andCrestliner. He has recently withdrawn his membership from the National Marine Manufacturers As-sociation in protest against industry supportof personal watercraft. Jacobs said he believes PWCs are bad for the boating industry. In fact, he said, they shouldn'tbe considered boats in the first place. Some on the panel questioned his motives.\"There's no question I have a lot invested in the boat business,\" he said. \"I don't need anyhelp for my business. I believe in free enter-prise.\" Jacobs, who lives on Lake Minnetonka, said he has witnessed the personal watercraft prob-lem firsthand while cruising the lake on hispontoon boat. \"They don't stay within the buoys, and they zig and they zag,\" he said. \"If they claim to beboats, why don't they act like boats?\" U.S. Coast Guard figures show that while PWCs make up 5 percent of the watercraft,they cause 37 percent of the accidents, Jacobssaid. \"It's not about the safe and friendly users,\" he said. \"It's about the abusers.\" Scott Hough, of Plymouth, said that al- though he is a safe and courteous rider, he,too, supports the bill. \"A lake is a neighborhood,\" he said. \"How can you as a good neighbor not have liabilityinsurance?\" Armed with a videotape of a PWC buzzing incessantly in front of her lake home, Kathy Continued on next pagePersonal watercraft, which critics describe as noisy and disruptive, would be banned from manyMinnesota lakes, under a bill advancing in the House.4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998By Jim Thielman At one time, he was the new kid (almost literally) on the block. But Bernie Omann,now Gov. Arne Carlson's chief of staff,doesn't recall being treated like a college kidwhen he stepped into the Minnesota Houseof Representatives in 1986. Omann was a student at St. Cloud State University when he won a special election toreplace his father, Ben, who died at thebeginning of his 1986 term. \"The nice thing was,\" Omann recalls, \"I was 22, and my vote mattered as much assomeone who was 60 or 70. In '86, thereweren't as many younger legislators as thereare now. As I recall, the closest one to me inage was in [his] early 30s. But people dealtwith me as just a member.\" This 80th Legislative Session features plenty of young representatives. Rep. DougStang (R-Cold Spring) is23, Rep. Torrey Westrom(R-Elbow Lake) is 24, andthere are others in their20s and early 30s. ButOmann was peerless whenhe began his six years inthe House RepublicanCaucus. Omann recalls his age quickly took a back seat toknowledge when he en-tered the House. \"In the committee pro- cess, it doesn't legisla-tors long to decide whostudies the issues,\" Omannsays. \"And whether you're 60 or 25, no onecomes into it who doesn't have somethingto learn. \"I don't know what it would be like to go back now, being a little bit older, but I neverfelt being younger was a hindrance. Onething that people who are young bring is adifferent perspective, and people appreciatea different perspective.\" As Carlson's chief of staff, Omann has worked to move legislators toward passing abill that would call for construction of a newbaseball stadium in the metropolitan area.He said one fond memory from his Housedays was working to get a provision in abonding bill for the National Hockey Cen-ter in St. Cloud. At the time, St. Cloud State was a DivisionAs governor's chief of staff,Omann recalls youthful impact III hockey program. But the team boastedformer Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooksat its helm, and the intent from the start wasto get St. Cloud into Division I, the mostcompetitive level of intercollegiate play. The $9.5 million arena was plagued by financial problems, and like the stadiumtopic Omann recalls, \"it was a controversialissue in the district I represented. But lookat it now: No way St. Cloud would be Divi-sion I without it.\" Omann still resides near Sartell, Minn., which is north of St. Cloud. In 1992 and 1994, Omann challenged DFLer Collin Peterson for the 7th Congres-sional District seat. Omann lost by scantpercentage points each time. In 1993 and 1994, he was assistant state commissioner of agriculture. In that capac-ity during the flood of '93, Omann was known for helping coordinate Carlson's many trips and meetings related to the is-sue. Omann's intimate knowledge of ruralissues was also considered to be a plus in theagriculture department role. He became Carlson's special assistant in 1994 and was named the chief of staff inMay 1997. At 32, Omann is one of theyounger chiefs of staff to serve a governor. With Carlson overseeing his final legisla- tive session, Omann will soon have to mullhis options for the future. \"At this time, I just want to help the governor get his proposals through the Leg-islature and help implement his vision,\"Omann said. \"I haven't spent a great deal oftime looking to get outside of the politicalarena.\" Blunt of Nisswa said her neighborhood wentdownhill with the arrival of the machines. Seeking privacy and tranquillity, Blunt and her husband moved north from the TwinCities three years ago. They spent their firstsummer on their 153-acre lake watching loons,ducks, eagles, and osprey, she said, and thenthe PWCs arrived. Now her sandy shorefront has turned to muck, she said, and there is only one pair ofloons left. \"The wildlife activity changed dramatically when the louder, faster, more erratic water-craft arrived,\" she said. Blunt explained that although a ban on lakes up to 200 acres in size would remove 87percent of Minnesota's lakes from PWC use,the remaining 13 percent of the lakes haveenormous amounts of water surface area. Pam Perry, a wildlife biologist with the DNR in Brainerd, said she is deeply concerned aboutthe effects of personal watercraft on wildlifeand loons. The bill would mandate a DNR study on the impact of PWCs on loons and loon nestingareas. Loons prefer to nest in shallow waterclose to shore where traditional boats can't go,Perry said. \"Now we have a recreational vehicle thatIrwin Jacobs, owner of a company that producesseveral lines of boats, testifies Feb. 2 in support ofa bill that would limit the use of personal watercrafton Minnesota lakes.

Arne Carlson's chief of staff, talks with members of the press after a recent news conference announcing a newproposal for an open-air stadium for the Twins.5 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Jan. 29 - Feb. 5, 1998 AGRICULTURE BANKINGStudying industrial hemp A bill that would call for a study of indus- trial hemp and its uses was approved by theHouse Agriculture Committee Feb. 2. The bill ( HF349 ), sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), passed on a 9-7 vote. Itattracted controversy because hemp is in thesame family as marijuana, an illegal controlledsubstance in the United States since 1937. Both plants carry the scientific classifica- tion of cannabis sativa , but they are different, according to information supplied to the com-mittee by the North American Industrial HempCouncil. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the intoxi- cating drug in both marijuana and hemp.Marijuana contains 3 percent to 20 percentTHC, while hemp contains .05 percent to 1 percent THC. In the latter case, 10-12 \"joints\"would have to be smoked in a short time to gethigh, according to the council. And thatamount of smoke and gas would be hard foranyone to take, the council claims. Proponents say industrial hemp can be made into paper which can be recycled more oftenthan wood-derived paper, and that hemp canbe used for clothing, fiber board, twine, birdseed, and oil. The finished product has noTHC in it. The uses for Minnesota farmers are obvi- ous, according to Tom Cochrane, executivedirector of the Minnesota Agri-GrowthCouncil. \"Anytime we are able to provide an alterna- tive crop with so many advantages, it's a goodchoice. If we don't find a way to study it, Ithink we're being remiss in working with our[farmers],\" he said. \"With the ability we haveto improve a product that has as much poten-tial as this, it would be a crying shame if wedidn't find a way to use this.\" The House considered the bill last year, but the measure did not come up for a vote on theHouse floor. A similar measure passed theSenate in 1997. Hemp, which is grown in Canada and 25 other countries, has been a topic of discussionin several states. But Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) said she has problems with even doing a study. \"I don't see why we're studying a lose-lose[situation],\" she said. \"This, to me, is nothing but a way to legalize an illegal drug.\" Some also expressed concerns that mari- juana plants could be hidden in a hemp field,but Kahn said hemp usually crowds out themarijuana plant and makes it hard for it togrow. Rep. Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prai- rie) encouraged her colleagues to support thebill. \"I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I didn't even pretend to inhale in college. And I'mfamiliar with [agricultural] technology,\" shesaid. Mike Campion, assistant superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion (MBCA), testified against the bill, sayingthere would be opposition from the law en-forcement community. The bill would direct the University of Min- nesota, working with the Department of Agri-culture and the MBCA, to study issues relatedto industrial hemp production. The bill now moves to the floor. Eliminating ATM surcharges Despite opposition from the banking in- dustry and several lawmakers, a bill that wouldeliminate some surcharges on Automatic TellerMachines (ATMs) was narrowly approvedFeb. 2 by the House Financial Institutions andInsurance Committee. The bill ( HF2292 ), sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), would preventbanks that own more than four ATMs fromassessing a surcharge for use of the machines. An earlier version of the bill would have applied to banks that own more than twomachines, but Anderson offered an amend-ment to address concerns about how the billwould affect smaller banks. ATM users are usually hit with two fees for each transaction. One fee is assessed by theirbank; the other is assessed by the bank thatowns the machine. Anderson's bill would ad-dress only the latter fee, which usually comesin the form of a charge at the time of thetransaction at an ATM not owned by thecustomer's bank network. Customers then often find a separate fee assessed at the end of the month on their bankstatement. That fee would be unaffected by the bill. Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth), who was among the bill's critics on the committee,said the measure \u2014 even with Anderson'samendment \u2014 would hurt small banks. \"Changing the threshold from two to four doesn't change that,\" Van Dellen said. \"Itseemed pretty clear the small community banksdid depend on their ability to make contractswith larger banks. \"If you want to vote for the bill, you think you know better than the private economy. Iknow we regulate banks, but we don't need toregulate this. It's a choice that our constitu-ents want.\" Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) was on the opposite side of the debate. \"I think this is an important piece of legis- said. \"Bank services are criti-cal . . . for citizens to be able to function in society. I think it responds directly to whatcitizens demand of their government.\" The bill now moves to the House floor. CHILDREN Child protection system Why did the system fail to protect Desi Irving? That question has plagued peopleworking in the child protection system sincethe child's tragic death in February 1997. \"We still don't know what happened to Desi Irving,\" Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul)said at a House Judiciary Committee meetingJan. 30. \"We have families that are crying outfor help and assistance who are not gettinghelp and assistance.\" Entenza is sponsoring a bill ( HF2985 ) that would provide comprehensive changes toMinnesota's child protection system. The billhas received approval from the Judiciary Com-mittee and is currently being reviewed by theHouse Health and Human Services Commit-tee. Last year, Mildred Irving plead guilty to second-degree murder in her three-year-olddaughter's death. She admitted to the courtthat she repeatedly hit Desi with an extensioncord, broke one of Desi's arms, and punchedher in the abdomen so hard that her liver waslacerated. The autopsy results showed thatDesi had suffered numerous broken bones,6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998had cigarette burns and many other scars, and had been suffering from malnutrition beforeher death. The brutality of Desi's death was accented by the fact that evidence shows that the Irvingfamily had been in contact with HennepinCounty's child protection services. Legislators sought to make sure that chil- dren like Desi were protected in the future.Attempts to bring Hennepin County case-workers to testify before the Legislature dur-ing the interim failed due to data privacyissues. Caseworkers expressed a desire to dis-close the facts of the case. However, they fearedlosing their jobs if they broke the data privacylaw. Last year, legislation that would have opened the child protection cases in the courts topublic scrutiny passed both bodies of the Leg-islature, but differences could not be workedout in conference committee in time for theend of session. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court has instituted a pilot project starting in June toopen court hearings in such cases. In January 1998, the legislative auditor re- leased an evaluation of the state's child protec-tion system. The auditor found that servicesvaried greatly from county to county and thatno external oversight exists to monitor theactions in these cases. The auditor suggestednumerous approaches to reforming the cur-rent state of the system. Entenza's bill incorporates many of the sug- gestions, along with changes recently man-dated by federal law. HF2985 would create a more uniform statewide system and attemptto provide a sufficient level of oversight tomake sure that the cases are handled effec-tively. The bill also seeks to place childrenmore quickly into permanent living situa-tions, either with a parent or another alterna-tive home. In addition, the bill would require that the Department of Human Services design a state-wide child protective services plan with inputfrom the county-administered programs. Andthe bill would appropriate $30 million to thedepartment for child welfare initiatives. Diane Benjamin, of the Children's Defense Fund, testified in support of the bill beforeJudiciary Committee. She said that this ap-proach will resolve some of the issues in thestate's child protective system. \"In the past, we have been working in the margins in these situations,\" Benjamin said,\"and we are excited about this legislation be-cause we think it takes a big step forward.\" HF2985 now is on its way to the Health and Human Services Finance Division.

In a time of mortgagecompany failures, it's best to get the money upfront, according to Rep. Matt Entenza(DFL-St. Paul). \"Some people have walked away from the title transfer with no money,\" he said, duringa Feb. 2 hearing before the House Commerce,Tourism and Consumer Affairs Committee. Although this has never happened to any- one in Minnesota, Entenza said, his bill(HF2972 ) would ensure that \"qualified\" loan funds are always available at the closing of aresidential real estate deal. The committeeapproved the measure. \"Qualified\" is clearly defined in the bill. Some types of qualified funds include cashin the form of U.S. currency, cashier's checksor bank money orders issued by a federallyinsured financial institution, and U.S. trea-sury checks. Martin Henschel, from the title arm of Edina Realty, said he supports the bill because hiscompany has had a few situations where theloan money did not come in for several weeksafter closing a sale. Curtis Loewe, of the attorney general's of- fice, said more than 10 states have adopted\"good money\" legislation to guarantee themoney is available at closing. \"When people go to a closing, they expecteverything to be done,\" he said. \"All this bill would do is ensure good funds.\" The bill now moves to the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee. Home mortgage services Shopping for a home mortgage can be risky and confusing. Consumers often assume theyare dealing with a bank whose activities areheavily regulated when, in fact, their lender orbroker may be an unknown player in theresidential mortgage industry. Should anything go wrong during the pro- cess, the consumer is left without any recourseexcept, perhaps, an appeal to the attorneygeneral's office. A bill ( HF2983 ) sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy) would license andregulate companies that perform residentialmortgage services in Minnesota. With the support of the Department of Commerce, the attorney general's office, andthe Minnesota Real Estate Services Associa-tion, HF2983 was approved by the House Commerce, Tourism and Consumer AffairsCommittee Feb. 2. The bill also would establish an industry- wide code of conduct against infractions suchas misrepresentation of services, misleadingstatements, or deceptive advertising. The stan-dards of conduct would apply even if thebusiness, such as a bank or credit union that isalready regulated, was exempt from licensing. Tunheim said that more than 40 states have7 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYalready adopted regulatory programs that ad- dress residential mortgage transactions. \"Clear standards of conduct which apply to all residential mortgage originations will pro-vide a level playing field within the industry aswell as offer protection to consumers,\" hesaid. The bill now moves to the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee. CRIME Court-ordered appearances The second time was a charm for a bill that would make it easier for prosecutors to com-pel offenders and witnesses to appear in court. HF3051 , sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), would increase penalties for in-dividuals who defy a court subpoena to appearin relation to a violent crime. The bill stalled on a tie vote the first time it came up in the House Judiciary CommitteeFeb. 4. Later, during the same meeting, Rep.Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) moved that the billbe reconsidered, and after a clarification, thebill was approved. The bill creates a five-year felony penalty for knowingly and willfully violating a court-or-dered appearance in relation to a crime ofviolence. The bill also requires that the actionmust be intended to obstruct the criminaljustice process. Mike Freeman, Hennepin County attor- ney, testified in support of the bill. He said thatthe bill is necessary to make sure that criminaltrials are not impeded. \"This is an attempt to provide some addi- tional inducements so that people show up,\"Freeman said. Michael Jones, of the Communities of Color Institute, told the committee that he had res-ervations about the bill. He said that he fearsthe bill would be used to compel people whofear retaliation to testify. Jones described what happened when he once witnessed a murder at a bar in Minne-apolis. He said that he was put in the back of asquad car where everyone could see that hewas a witness, and although he wanted to seejustice done, he felt very uncomfortable in thesituation. \"When it dawned on me, I got scared. And this is real,\" Jones said. \"Because I have kidsand they need a dad \u2014 someone who will bearound for the next 60 years or so.\" Jones said everyone who lives in a commu- nity plagued by violence wants to see justicedone. He said that some protection needs tobe put in place to make sure that witnesses feelsafe in the justice system.\"Quite frankly, if it's bad enough and I feel threatened, I'm out of the state, and justice isnot done,\" Jones said. \"Even parents tell theirkids in some situations, 'Don't talk. You'reputting your family at risk'\" The bill is set to be included in the omnibus crime bill to be assembled this session. Obstructing police officers A bill that would toughen penalties for ob- structing police officers was debated Feb. 2 bythe House Judiciary Committee. HF2702 is sponsored by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), who said the bill is inresponse to a situation that occurred in CoonRapids, Minn. Officer David Westberg, of the Coon Rap- ids Police Department, told the committeethat he and other officers were trying to re-move some disorderly individuals from a motelin late 1997. He said that the situation came toa point where arrests became necessary. As theofficers were attempting to remove disorderlyindividuals, others began to verbally confrontand \"chest butt\" the officers. And, Westberg said, the situation soon got worse. Five arrests had to be made, two offic-ers suffered broken bones, and one officersuffered a heart attack. Under current law, individuals must act with the knowledge that their action creates arisk of death or substantial bodily harm to becharged with felony obstruction, which is pun-ishable by up to five years in prison. Weaver'sbill would remove that requirement, makingit easier to prosecute people who obstructpolice officers. Paul Young, assistant attorney with Anoka County, testified in support of Weaver's bill.He said the current law for obstruction of thelegal process is too restrictive. If punches had been thrown by the indi- viduals in the Coon Rapids case, they couldhave been charged with fourth-degree assault,according to Young. However, in this specificincident punches were never thrown. \"The dilemma I had was trying to find a crime that this action fit into,\" Young said.\"We have to show the intent to commit theharm, and it's an unfair burden for officers toprove and for prosecutors to establish.\" The committee took no action on the bill. It is expected to be discussed again this session. Gang-related crimes The House Judiciary Committee approved two bills Feb. 2 that would increase penaltieson illegal activities done for the benefit of agang.Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring legislation that would increase the penaltiesfor witness tampering \u2014 a problem oftenassociated with gang cases. HF2305 adds witness tampering to the list of crimes requiring a minimum prisonsentence. David Steinkamp, assistant attorney gen- eral assigned to the Minnesota Gang StrikeForce, told the committee of a situation wherea witness was stopped on the street by a car-load of suspected gang members. She was toldshe had better not go to court, and when shelooked in the car she saw that the driver had agun. The gun was never pointed at her, but thethreat was implicit, he said. Mullery's bill also would add witness tam- pering to the list of eligible crimes which candefine an organization as a criminal gang. \"[Witness tampering] is the bread and but- ter of gang activity,\" Steinkamp said. \"Whenyou add witness tampering, you increase theparameter as to what counts as a gang and thatis very helpful.\" Dakota County Attorney Jim Backstrom told the committee that increasing the penaltyfor witness tampering is necessary to effec-tively prosecute gang members. \"Clearly, this sends the message that these types of crimes will not be tolerated,\"Backstrom said. HF2305 also would provide grant money to the counties to fund programs to help ensurethe safety and security of witnesses. Steinkampsaid there is a misconception that the countieshave large budgets to deal with witness protec-tion. He said that the new funds would be usedto make witnesses who testify feel morecomfortable. Also, Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) is spon- soring HF2679 , which would enhance cur- rent law that provides increased penalties forsome gang-related crimes. The bill would expand the law to increase penalties for all crimes that are motivated byinvolvement with a gang. Mike Freeman, Hennepin County attor- ney, said the new language is necessary toassist prosecutors in gang-related cases. Hesaid that the current law was a step in the rightdirection, but the proposed expansion wouldmake it more effective. \"[The current law is] a good idea, but it's difficult to prove,\" Freeman said. \"We believethis [change] will help us make use of a statutethat, frankly, has not been useful before.\" Both bills are set to be included in this year's omnibus crime bill.8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998EDUCATIONSCHOOL The state and failing schools A plan for the state to take over failing schools faced some opposition at its first com-mittee hearing Feb. 4. HF3214 , sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL- St. Cloud), would measure a school's perfor-mance based on its scores on the new statewidetests. Schools showing poor scores over sev-eral years could eventually be turned intostate-sponsored charter schools, over whichschool districts would lose their authority. But some members of the K-12 Education Finance Division of the House EducationCommittee said the proposal goes too far inpunishing districts. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) called the bill \"harmful overkill.\" And Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), chair of the full Education Committee, saidthat it's not clear that the state could do abetter job of running at-risk schools than dis-tricts could. The bill is one of several this year that try to identify accountability for poor showings onthe newly implemented statewide testing. Under Opatz's plan, schools that show a 1 percent increase in scores would be eligiblefor reward money, while schools that showeda 5 percent decrease would be eligible for stateassistance. That assistance would include state-ap- pointed educators sent in to monitor theschools. After several years without improve-ment, schools could be converted into charterschools and the new board of directors wouldhave the authority to fire or demote teachers. Opatz said that state takeover would likely be a rare event. \"But what alternative do we have?\" he asked. \"Do we just throw up our hands?\" Opponents of the bill included teachers unions and school districts. Minneapolis Superintendent Carol Johnson specifically criticized a provision that wouldallow students to transfer from failing schoolsto successful schools. She said already issues ofspace \"are no small task\" in Minneapolisschools. The division did not vote on the bill, but later will consider it for inclusion in this year'somnibus K-12 funding bill. Seven-month-old Maria Gisselquist, daughterof Minnesota Historical Society employeeShana Crosson, captures the attention of thoseattending a Capitol press conference whereSen. John Hottinger and Rep. Nora Slawikunveiled a bill that seeks a constitutionalamendment creating an \"endowment forMinnesota's children.\"Child endowment Top priority capital projects Metro-area magnet schools and residential boarding academies were designated top-pri-ority building projects by the K-12 EducationFinance Division of the House EducationCommittee, which finalized its prioritized list of capital projects Feb. 4. The division considered 31 project requests and ranked them according to importance. At the top of the list is $15 million for developing a magnet school in Robbinsdale toaid integration in the western metropolitanarea. That amount would cover estimatedbuilding costs for one of three proposed schoolsin the West Metro Education Program. Theprogram first received planning funds fromthe 1990 Legislature. The division's recommendations also in- clude (as a lower priority) $15 million for asimilar school in the eastern metropolitanarea. Another $2 million is ranked among the top five K-12 bonding priorities to allow comple-tion of a downtown Minneapolis magnetschool. A lower priority on the division's list isthe same amount to provide startup costs foran Edina magnet school, with $11.2 millionfor construction costs at that location far downon the list. Those two schools are also part ofthe West Metro Education Program. All funds for magnet schools are proposed to come from general obligation bonds. Thegovernor's bonding proposal included no funding for magnet schools. But the division's second-ranked project \u2014 residential boarding academies for at-riskyouth \u2014 carries the governor's full support.The division and the governor both recom-mend $12 million from the general fund todevelop three academies. Third on the division's list of priorities is a St. Paul community-based elementary schoolsproject, which also has the governor's ap-proval. Both recommend $4.6 million in bondfunds for that project. The division sent a bill ( HF772 ) listing the K-12 bonding priorities to the full EducationCommittee. The bill is sponsored by Rep. GeriEvans (DFL-New Brighton). The bonding recommendations will even- tually be submitted to the House CapitalInvestment Committee to be considered forinclusion in this year's bonding bill. School year start dates A bill that would allow schools to start classes before Labor Day was opposed by thehospitality industry during a Feb. 2 Housecommittee hearing. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville), would permanently repeal aban on schools starting before Labor Day. Themeasure would take effect in the 2000-2001school year. A 1997 law allows districts to start the school year as early as the Wednesday before theholiday for the 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 aca-demic years. Wolf told the K-12 Education Finance Divi- sion of the House Education Committee thatHF3003 was one of the results of an interim subcommittee which tried to \"take a goodlook at anything we could do to take someconstraints off the [school] districts.\" Bob Meeks of the Minnesota School Boards Association supported the proposal. \"This is really a local decision and should be based on local needs,\" he said. But representatives from hospitality trade associations said that moving up school startdates would harm that industry. \"[Starting after Labor Day] adds an addi- tional week to 10 days to a very small [tour-ism] season,\" Tom Newcome, of HospitalityMinnesota, said. He asked the committee towait to see how the current two-year \"com-promise\" works out, saying there was no needto rush legislation aimed at 2000-2001. However, some lawmakers said that the well-being of hospitality businesses shouldnot affect decision-making by an educationcommittee.9 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY \"Here, we're looking at what's good for kids,\" Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville)said. Committee chair Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL- Shakopee) agreed. \"If parents want to start after Labor Day, local school board representatives are not go-ing to turn a deaf ear to that desire,\" she said.\"To me, this is a stereotypical local-controlissue.\" The bill was laid over for possible inclusion in this year's omnibus K-12 finance bill. Compulsory summer school Minnesota students may soon have a new incentive to pass their basic skills tests: avoid-ing summer school. A bill approved by the House Education Committee's Subcommittee on Quality Ini-tiatives Feb. 3 would give school districts theauthority to compel students to attend sum-mer school. And district officials said they could use that authority to provide assistance for stu-dents who fail one or more of the basic skillstests given under the state's graduation rule. Rep. Len Biernat who is spon- soring HF2276 , said the bill's goal is to give districts more control. \"If a school district is to be accountable for results, then it should have all the leverage itneeds to achieve those results,\" he said. The bill also would redefine a truant stu- dent as one who has missed five days of school.Under current law, a child must miss 15 daysto be considered a truant. Once a student isofficially declared a truant, child protectiveservices can intervene to assist the student. The proposal is supported by the Minne- apolis School District, which hopes to buildon the success of its 1997 summer schoolprogram. Last summer, more than 10,000 students attended summer school in that district, andmany showed up to six months of academicgrowth after a two- to eight-week program. But only 30 percent of the district's eighth- graders who failed the basic-skills test showedup for summer school \u2014 and that's the num-ber officials say they want to improve. \"There are students who don't take [the tests] seriously,\" said John Oullette-Howitz ofthe Minneapolis district, who helped organizelast year's program. \"We want them to findout before the year 2002 \u2014 when they don'tget their diploma \u2014 that the district takes itvery seriously.\" The bill would allow districts to determine for themselves which students must attendsummer programs.The bill now moves to the full Education Committee. ELECTIONS Girls from schools all over the state gather in the Capitol rotunda to celebrate Girls and Womenin Sports Day Feb. 5. The event, sponsored by the Minnesota Coalition to Promote Women inAthletic Leadership and the National Girls and Women in Sports Day Committee, celebratesfemales who participate in sports, encourages participation, and recognizes sports leaders.Women in sportsAbsentee ballots For some, the goal is to remove as many obstacles as possible to voting. They did it in apilot project in Ramsey County, and nowthey're looking to do it in a pilot project inSenate District 58 in north Minneapolis. HF2293 , sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), would allow eligiblevoters in Senate District 58 to vote by absenteeballot until Jan. 1, 2002, without having toprovide a reason. The House General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and Elections Committee approvedthe bill Feb. 2. All voters would have to do is apply in writing to the Hennepin County auditor'soffice, providing such basic information astheir name, address, and signature. \"The district has repeatedly had the lowest voter turnout in the entire state, and we havethe largest number of minorities in the state,\"Jefferson said. It's also an area with a high concentration of poverty and renters, and all of those factorsoften mean low voter turnout, he said. A result of the low voter turnout is that people running for statewide office often don'tmake north Minneapolis one of their cam-paign stops. \"We would hope we would have more can-didates coming into the area,\" Jefferson said. Under current law, people wanting to vote with an absentee ballot must have a reason,such as absence from the precinct, illness,disability, observance of a religious holiday, orservice as an election judge. An absentee ballotis mailed or given to the voter, who fills it outlike a regular ballot and mails it back to thecounty auditor's office. The ballots are helduntil election day, then tallied with all theother ballots. \"The bill would increase voter turnout,\" said Joe Mansky, director of the ElectionsDivision of the Office of the Secretary of State. But there was some opposition to Jefferson's bill. \"How are we going to make sure the people actually do live in the district? Things changeall the time. Is it really feasible?\" Rep. Bill Haas(R-Champlin) asked. The committee also approved a bill (HF2567 ) that would extend the pilot project in Ramsey County. The bill is sponsored byRep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul). In 1991, Anoka, Hennepin, Polk, and Ramsey counties were part of a pilot projectwhich allowed for open absentee balloting. In1994, Ramsey County had the pilot projectextended until this year, and the county nowwants the project extended until Dec. 31, 1999. McCollum said she has heard positive things about the project. \"There has been no indication of fraud; we just want to continue it the way it's been.\" shesaid. Both bills now move to the House floor.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998Need a copy of a bill? Call the Chief Clerks Office at (612) 296-2314EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTFAMILY The right to strike Would a strike by 911 dispatchers threaten a community's public safety? That was the crux of a debate Feb. 2 over a bill that would grant public safety dispatchersthe status of essential employees. Under that status, workers give up the right to strike, but they can still request arbitrationin a labor dispute. Frank Whippler, legislative chair of the Minnesota Sheriff's Association, testified insupport of HF1693 before the House Labor- Management Relations Committee. \"In our view, a strike would be detrimental to public safety,\" he said. His description of dispatchers as \"indis- pensable to the community\" drew a round ofapplause from dispatchers in the audience. The committee approved the bill, which is sponsored by Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-SouthSt. Paul). Also in support of the bill are the Minnesota Professional Firefighters Association, LawEnforcement Labor Services, and, accordingto Whippler, 96 percent of the state's 911dispatchers. But officials from both the League of Min- nesota Cities and the Association of Minne-sota Counties testified against the bill. \"A strike would be disruptive and unpleas- ant, but not an immediate threat to publicsafety,\" said Kevin Frazell, of the League ofMinnesota Cities. He cited a strike by Ramsey County dis- patchers \u2014 the only such strike in the state'shistory. Public safety was not threatened whenbackup county workers took over for the strik-ing dispatchers, Frazell said. Concern about taking away the workers' right to strike was at the heart of opposition tothe bill. \"It is, at times, essential for people to go on strike and walk the picket line so that theirfellow workers can benefit,\" Rep. TomRukavina (DFL-Virginia) said. \"As you startdown this path of essential employees, wheredoes it end? I'm afraid we're going to do awaywith the right of all employees to collectivelybargain.\" But other lawmakers said that although they were sympathetic to Rukavina's point, theysupported the bill because it came with thebacking of the employees, the employers, andthe union. \"If this were coming from Gov. Carlson, I would not be supportive,\" Rep. Thomas Bakk(DFL-Cook) said. \"The reason I support thisbill is because it is fundamentally coming from the workers.\" The bill now moves to the House floor, where it stalled last year after passing out of thesame committee. A companion bill passed theSenate last year. Motors in boundary waters? Despite decades of debate, the controversy over the use of motors in the Boundary WatersCanoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) contin-ues. Rep. John ing a bill ( HF2231 ) that aims to finalize the status of the BWCAW once and for all. The bill would ensure that the phasing out of motors that was agreed upon in the 1978Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Actcontinues on schedule. Tuma said that U.S. Sen. Rod Grams and U.S. Rep. James Oberstar are currently sup-porting legislation to roll back the clock on theissue. \"Minnesota needs to send a strong message to Congress that we do not want to go back-wards on this effort,\" Tuma said. The bill passed the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee Feb. 4. But the proposal was met with major oppo- sition from Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook). \"The entire [BWCAW] is in my district and the issue is much more complicated than whatRep. Tuma has brought here today,\" he said.\"Please do not be misled to think that this billrestores the integrity of the 1978 act.\" Bakk said that there were some things in the 1978 act that were not well planned, particu-larly a ban on motorized boats on lakes alongthe Canadian border. \"Canadians have motors,\" he said. \"It makes no sense to allow motors on one side of animaginary line and not on the other.\" Bakk said that Congress and the U.S. Forest Service are trying to deal with that and othercomplicated issues. \"It shouldn't be the Legislature that mon- keys with a delicate compromise that wasreached in 1978,\" he said. The bill now moves on to the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture FinanceCommittee.Family asset accounts A problem for low-income people is that the cost to get out of their fix \u2014 like buying ahome, going to college, or starting a smallbusiness \u2014 is prohibitive. An attempt to ease those costs is found in a bill ( HF2748 ) sponsored by Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm). low-income families to contributemoney to a \"family asset account\" and receivematching amounts from the state or a privateorganization. The money could then be spent for certain approved purposes, like paying for school or ahouse, making a major home repair, or start-ing a small business. To be eligible, a family'sannual income could be no more than twicethe federal poverty level. The poverty level fora family or four is $16,050. The bill was heard and approved Feb. 4 by the House Financial Institutions and Insur-ance Committee. \"This is a very simple bill. It's such a good thing that both the credit unions and thebanks are supporting it,\" Tomassoni said. Tomassoni said the proposed program could be compared to an Individual RetirementAccount. Other states are considering suchprograms and similar legislation is pending inthe U.S. Congress, he said. Harland Tardy, of the Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency, said groups like hiswould work with families who are in the pro-gram, along with the banks and credit unions. Often, people renting an apartment or a house pay more in rent than they might in amonthly house payment, but they can't afforda down payment, he said. The program would allow them to save in a \"family asset account,\" get their savingsmatched, and use the money for a down pay-ment on a house, he said. \"It's just any family trying to better them- selves,\" Tomassoni said. Under the bill, the matching funds from the state and private sector would be kept in aseparate account, and the family would notget the money until they have finished aneconomic literacy course and achieved theirgoals for buying a home, paying for school, ordevising a business plan. The program would be administered by the Minnesota Department of Children, Familiesand Learning. The bill now moves to the House Education Committee.11 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY Defibrillator demoHEALTH A dummy is used to demonstrate how to use an automatic external defibrillator during an American Heart Association event Feb. 2 in the Capitol rotunda. The event was part of an effortto educate people about the need for public access to the life-saving defibrillators.'Off-label' drug use According to a 1990 Gallup survey of oncologists, about 10 percent of cancer pa-tients do not receive the treatment prescribedby their physicians, even if the patient re-sponds to that treatment. The problem occurs when a prescribed drug has not been approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for treating certainforms of cancer. The attempt to treat patients with the so- called \"off-label\" use of drugs is not uncom-mon, says Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe).Mulder, a practicing family physician, said,\"Every physician in this state uses off-labeldrugs for patients.\" But, Mulder said, \"Managed-care [health plans] sometimes don't want to pay for itsuse.\" Under a bill sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), health plans couldnot exclude reimbursement of off-label druguse in cancer patients, provided the drug isrecognized as a treatment of cancer in stan-dard medical literature. The bill, which was approved by the House Health and Human Services Committee Feb.3, would not cover experimental drugs used incancer treatment. Nurse Ann Deshler, of Edina, told commit- tee members that sometimes a rare form ofcancer responds to treatment used in morecommon cancers. But if the FDA has notapproved a drug for treating that specific can-cer, a patient might be denied reimbursement. Deshler has been a registered oncology nurse for 19 years. She told of a patient who re-sponded well to an off-label treatment, only tosee his coverage eventually denied. She saidsuch problems are frustrating for the patientand that medical professionals are forced toexpend their time dealing with insurance com-panies \"on a case-by-case basis when the timecould treat patients.\" Hausman's bill ( HF1306 ) would prohibit all health plans, including Medicare supple-mental coverage, from refusing to pay forthese cancer treatments. There are 27 otherstates with similar laws. The bill moves to the House Financial Insti- tutions and Insurance Committee.Licensing naturopaths For the fourth time since 1986, a bill that would license naturopathic physicians has beenintroduced in the House. Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) is spon- soring the bill ( HF396 ), which was heard Feb. 2 by the Subcommittee on Licensing andScope of Practice of the House Health andHuman Services Committee. The bill would license and regulate naturo- pathic doctors under the Board of MedicalPractice. Naturopaths would have to graduatefrom an approved naturopathic medical col-lege or degree-granting program, and pass theNaturopathic Physicians Licensing Examina-tion. They also would have to practice in Min-nesota for two years under a board-approved,licensed physician, osteopath, or naturopathicphysician. Naturopaths treat clients with nutrition, herbal remedies, manipulative therapy, mas-sage, and other non-invasive techniques. From1927 to 1974, naturopaths could practice byregistering with the state Board of HealingArts. Since 1974, they have existed in legallimbo. Wejcman said, \"This legislation doesn't put anyone out of business.\" Those who providehomeopathic and other remedies would stillbe able to do so. What the bill would do isallow licensed naturopaths the exclusive rightto use certain terms, such as \"naturopathicphysician\" and the abbreviation, \"N.D.\" Vio-lators would be guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill was prompted after a naturopath who had practiced in St. Paul since 1983 wasaccused of practicing medicine without a li- cense in 1996. An injunction against thenaturopath was lifted when she and the Boardof Medical Practice agreed she would stopcalling herself a physician. At the time, she was among six naturo- pathic doctors in the state with four-year de-grees in the field. A dozen other states alreadylicense naturopathic doctors. The bill was sent to the full House Human Services Committee, along with a separate bill(HF1135 ) that would allow massage and Ori- ental bodywork therapists to register with thestate. The latter bill would serve a similarpurpose for massage therapists, and wouldnot define the scope of practice. Sponsored by Betty McCollum (DFL-St. Paul), the bill would allow massage and Ori-ental bodywork therapists to register with theBoard of Chiropractic Examiners after meet-ing certain requirements. Only registered prac-titioners would be allowed to use the title\"Registered Massage Therapist\" or \"RegisteredOriental Bodywork Therapist.\" HIGHER EDUCATION If you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.Biology building funding The construction of a $70 million cellular and molecular biology building is the center-piece of the University of Minnesota's 1998legislative funding request. But some lawmak-ers argued Feb. 5 that only $8.5 million fordesign and demolition should be appropri-ated this session.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998HOUSING Rep. Hilda Bettermann (R-Brandon), the lead Republican of the Higher Education Fi-nance Division of the House Education Com-mittee, was concerned that regionalconstruction companies would be unable tokeep pace with burgeoning projects in thisbooming economy. The finance committee ultimately approved $416.5 million in bonding for statewide highereducation building projects and sent the billto the full Education Committee. Bettermann said the House Capital Invest- ment Committee on which she serves hasconcerns over approximately $660 million inunissued bonds, not all of which are for highereducation, from earlier bonding laws. \"All of the builders around the state are busy, and they cannot necessarily keep upwith building projects,\" Bettermann said. She said some lawmakers would prefer to fund only the design portion of the biologybuilding. But Dr. Frank Cerra, head of the University of Minnesota Academic Health Center, saidconstruction on the molecular biology build-ing would begin in the fall of 1999 and thebuilding would open in 2001. Cerra said auniversity-wide policy committee has beenoperational for eight months, and the com-mittee is certain \"we are on track with ourtimeline.\" Some lawmakers also wanted to increase from $43 million to $65.2 million the appro-priation for Higher Education Asset Preserva-tion and Replacement (HEAPR) in theMinnesota State Colleges and UniversitiesSystem (MnSCU). HEAPR projects include building health and safety improvements, infrastructure re-pair, and projects that update the exterior,interior, mechanical or electrical systems.MnSCU comprises Minnesota's 36 technical,community, and state colleges. Remedies for 'sick houses' New homes are tighter and better insulated than in the past. Trouble is, according to Rep.Geri Evans (DFL-New Brighton), they mayrot from trapped moisture or make peoplesick if not properly ventilated. Evans, who is sponsoring a bill ( HF2430 ) that aims to remedy problems with \"sickhouses,\" brought the well-publicized issue tothe House Commerce, Tourism, and Con-sumer Affairs Committee Feb. 3. She reminded the panel of the plight of homeowner Sue Stavenau, of Plymouth, whohad testified before the committee Jan. 29.Stavenau was the subject of a Minneapolis Star Tribune investigative series, \"The Trouble with Houses,\" which first drew significant atten-tion to the issue last fall. \"Her house has ruined her life, her health, and her pocketbook,\" Evan said. One provision of Evans' bill would increase contractor license fees to pay for a publicinformation program about residential con-struction issues, including potential moistureand indoor air quality problems. The bill also would increase new home war- ranty periods and give homeowners more timeto report defective conditions and seek legalaction. The bill was narrowly approved by thecommittee. The provision of the bill that drew the most criticism would require the commissioner ofpublic service to adopt, as part of the stateenergy code, rules that require new residentialbuildings to contain mechanical ventilationsystems. Tom Joachim, from the building code divi- sion of the Department of Administration, saidthat due to the \"tightening\" of homes requiredby the state building and energy codes, mechani-cal ventilation systems are necessary to protectagainst moisture and other problems. \"In the effort to save energy, am I now creating the need for more energy?\" askedRep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul). Lisa Peterson, of the Builders Association of Minnesota, said that although energy is re-quired to operate mechanical ventilation sys-tems, people will still see overall savings. Since the \"tightening\" of homes has caused the need for mechanical ventilation in the firstplace, some critics on the panel wondered ifthe building and energy codes need to berevamped. \"I think we should look at what caused the need for mechanical ventilation in the firstplace,\" said Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee). Opponents of the provision also objected to the cost. Peterson said that Department of Public Service figures put the estimated cost of amechanical ventilation system at $6,084 for anew two-story, 3000-square-foot (R- Fergus Falls) said, \"is that everyone talks aboutaffordable housing and this will add on evenmore money.\" The bill now moves to the Economic Devel- opment Finance Division of the House Eco-nomic Development and International TradeCommittee. Susan Lasley, of St. Paul, who has Multiple ChemicalSensitivity, listens to testimony before the Housingand Housing Finance Division about a bill thatwould make grants of up to $25,000 available toindividuals with the disorder to help them inmaking their homes free of chemicals.Chemical sensitivity Kenneth Wuori, of Prior Lake, told law- makers that he was forced to sleep in a vanoutside his townhouse because of his reactionto household chemicals in the new dwelling. \"I could not go into my new house . . . for fear that I would get ill,\" he said, in Feb. 3testimony before the Housing and HousingFinance Division of the House Economic De-velopment and International TradeCommittee. Myra Radel, of Little Canada, told the com- mittee she has had chronic problems with theoverwhelming number of chemicals in herhome. She said that she had to move out of arelatively chemical-free environment becauseshe had a reaction to the chemicals in herroommate's hand lotion. Wuori and Radel told the committee that they suffer from a disorder called multiplechemical sensitivity (MCS). They have allergy-like sensitivity to a broad range of householdsubstances, such as cleaning solvents, deter-gents, perfumes, and household dust and mold. They said they often suffer from back pains, sleep disorders, stomach pains, anxiety,chronic fatigue, and respiratory problems dueto the large number of chemicals common inhomes.13 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYHF2555 sponsored by Rep. Jim Rostberg (R-Isanti), would provide grant money topeople who suffer from MCS to refurbishtheir homes to make them chemical-free.Currently, loans are made available throughthe Minnesota Housing Finance Agency tofinance improvements, but Rostberg said thefunds should come in the form of grants. \"One of the problems we have is that people with MCS cannot qualify for these loans be-cause they are unable to work,\" Rostberg said. The bill proposes that $1 million be made available in the form of grants administeredthrough the Minnesota Housing FinanceAgency, enough for 40 grants totaling $25,000each. \"We need scent-free housing,\" Wuori said. \"It's important that we have sleeping quartersbecause sleeping in a van or a tent, as somepeople with MCS do, is as bad as being home-less.\" The bill was laid over by the committee and is expected to be included in this year's omni-bus housing bill. INDUSTRYLow-income high-rises Chris Learned, a resident of Minneapolis, said that a society had developed among the350 residents in her rent-subsidized housingcomplex on Oak Grove near Loring Park.People look after and take care of each other.She said that older people, Russian immi-grants, and low-income young people all seeto it that no one is overlooked. All that will change if the plan to make her high-rise a market-rate property becomes areality, she said. \"The announcement of the mortgage pre- payment in June of 1997 was the beginning ofthe systematic dismembering of our society,\"Learned said. Learned was referring to the decision by the owners of her place of residence to refinancethe balance of their federal mortgage, allowingthe owners to charge market-rate rent for theunits. The decision means an increase of ap-proximately $200 in rent per month for theelderly, handicapped, and low-income ten-ants in the building. In the 1970s, the federal government set up a program where developers received reduced-rate mortgages and financing incentives tobuild low- and moderate-income housing,such as Learned's building. Rent rates weresubsidized by the federal government and rentincreases were regulated. Owners of these complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allows them toprepay the remaining portion of their mort-gage and to begin charging market rate rent. The situation at Learned's building could happen at the over 300 apartment complexesthroughout the state that were financedthrough the federal program. The owners ofHopkins Village in Hopkins, Knox Landing inBloomington, and Grand Pre By the Park andSelby-Dayton in St. Paul have all announcedthat they plan to take advantage of the prepay-ment option. Learned and many others currently living in federally assisted housing testified beforethe Housing and Housing Finance Division ofthe House Economic Development and Inter-national Trade Committee on Feb. 5. \"The only solution that would help us save our homes at this point is to have a nonprofitorganization buy our building,\" Learned said. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) is sponsoring a bill ( HF2991 ) that would equip the Minne- sota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA), localunits of government, and nonprofit organiza-tions to deal with this issue. The Oak Grovebuilding is in Long's district. The bill authorizes the MHFA to issue loans and provide tax credits to assist in maintain-ing already existing low-income housing. Thefinancial incentives can be made available tolocal units of government and nonprofit orga-nizations. HF2991 was approved by the committee and is set to be included in this year's omnibushousing bill. TAXES 'Negative checkoff' Telephone customers sometimes receive mailed notices that their long distance carrierwill be switched unless the customer cancelsthe change. The practice is called \"negativecheckoff.\" Under a bill introduced by Rep. Loren Jennings (D-Harris), long distance carrierswould be required to make audio recordingsof customers authorizing a negative checkoffand to be able to produce the recordings ifcontested. If the carrier could not provide such evi- dence, the bill ( HF3042 ) would force the car- rier to pay the cost of returning the customerto the original long distance service and toassume the cost of the services during theunauthorized period. Representatives of AT&T told the House Regulated Industries and Energy CommitteeFeb. 3 the company had no opposition to thatsection of the bill. AT&T and some other longdistance providers use a practice called \"third-party verification,\" in which the customer tells a third party during a telephone solicita-tion that the change is authorized. But AT&T opposed a section of the bill pertaining to public notification of rate in-creases. Currently, long distance carriers maynotify customers of rate hikes through billinserts, direct mailing, phone call, or publica-tion of the increase in general circulation news-papers. The latter is the most common form ofpublic notification. The bill would repeal the provision that allows carriers to notify customers of increasesthrough newspaper ads. AT&T representatives said newspaper ads are the most efficient and affordable methodof disclosure. The company said if the methodwere eliminated, it would increase their cost ofproviding service to Minnesota customers. The committee took no action on the bill. Child care tax credit With seven of 10 mothers in the workforce, five of six mothers with children under the ageof six working, and with the cost of having aninfant in day care running about $7,000 a year,some see a great need for more help from theLegislature. Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood) is sponsoring a bill ( HF2804 ) that would lend a hand in that direction. The bill was approvedFeb. 3 by the Sales and Income Tax Division ofthe House Taxes Committee. The state currently allows a child care tax credit equal to a percentage of child care costs,up to a maximum of $720 for one child or$1,140 for two or more children. That creditbegins to decrease for parents making $17,340a year and is completely phased out for par-ents making $31,080. Slawik's bill would decrease the rate in which the credit is phased out and increase the in-come at which the credit would be completelyphased out to $45,080 per year. Slawik said 22,000 new children enter the day care system every year and that paying forthat child care takes an average 10 percent ofthe family income. Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) was in favor of the proposal, but he said theremight be opposition from people making morethan $45,080. \"We ought to look at a way to make it more universally acceptable,\" he said. Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) also expressed concerns about the bill. \"Aren't you concerned that this is a deepen-14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998ing of the difference in the way we treat people with children and the way we treat singlepeople and people who don't work outside thehome?\" he asked. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) said it's important to try to help parents and,ultimately, children. \"The world wouldn't last any longer if people didn't have children,\" she said. \"With the jobmarket the way it is, we are bringing everyoneinto the workforce.\" Tom Prichard, president of the Minnesota Family Council, urged caution. He said thebill would likely \"encourage\" families to makethe decision to have both parents work andput the children in day care. \"[The government should be] allowing families to make the child care decision, ratherthan being encouraged by tax policy,\" he said.\"Government policy should be necessitating,rather than encouraging them, biasing themin favor of day care. I think we're giving themthe wrong incentive.\" The bill now moves to the full Taxes Com- mittee. Permanent tax reductions House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) believes the time is now for a perma-nent tax cut, and he's brought forth a bill thatwould do just that. The bill ( HF2322 ) had two hearings re- cently before two divisions of the House TaxesCommittee \u2014 first in the Property Tax andTax Increment Finance Division Feb. 4 andthe Sales and Income Tax Division Feb. 5.Both divisions sent the bill to the full TaxesCommittee without recommendation. Sviggum said there have been six consecu- tive budget forecasts showing surpluses instate coffers. And instead of providing one-time tax refunds, Sviggum said, people \u2014particularly those in the low- and middle-income categories \u2014 should be given a per-manent tax reduction. The bill would permanently reduce income taxes for low- and middle-income people andprovide a one-time rebate for property taxespaid in 1998. The property tax rebate would match the one approved for property taxes paid in 1997.That means homeowners would get back 20percent of property taxes paid in 1998, andrenters would get 3.6 percent of rent paid (theportion of rent that goes to pay property taxes). \"The bottom line of my bill: Return the money to the taxpayers,\" Sviggum said. \"Iwould like to make sure we can't spend themoney. Members, I will tell you it's time for areduced tax rate in Minnesota.\" Reaction from the Property Tax and TaxIncrement Finance Division was mixed, and there were differences of opinion as to who ispaying more taxes. \"We have been overtaxing the property tax- payers,\" said Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls). \"I'veoverwhelmingly had complaints about theburden of property taxes.\" Long also said she was concerned about making permanent tax cuts and shortly there-after having to pass higher taxes because theeconomy takes a downturn. That happened in1979 and 1986, she said. Tax break for libraries Public libraries would get financial assis- tance in the form of a new tax break, under abill advancing in the House. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) is spon- soring a bill ( HF2303 ) that would give public libraries the same exemption on paying salestax that is currently enjoyed by public schools. The bill was approved Feb. 3 by the Sales and Income Tax Division of the House TaxesCommittee. The exemption would apply to public li- braries and cooperative regional library sys-tems. County and state law libraries weregranted the exemption in 1993. The exemption for public libraries is now limited to the buying of reading material andequipment used by patrons, software and cata-loging, and circulation equipment. Dawkins' bill would expand that exemp- tion. Examples of purchases that would be- TRANSPORTATION Rep. Loren Jennings and Sen. Roy Terwilliger explain the funding aspects of a new proposal fora downsized, open-air stadium for the Minnesota Twins during a Feb. 3 press conference. Theysaid the plan would allow a new ballpark to be built without using tax dollars, but the plan hasbeen criticized because it would use the income taxes paid by both Twins and visiting playersto help repay bonds that would be issued to pay for the stadium.New stadium proposalcome exempt from sales tax include furniture,work stations, laminating and binding ma-chines, office and building supplies, and util-ity services. Ken Behringer, of the Great River Regional Library in St. Cloud, said the current law canbe confusing. \"If I buy a delivery vehicle, it's not taxable. If I buy a vehicle for training, it is taxable. Itlimits the libraries' flexibility,\" he said. It's estimated that the change in the tax code would cost about $90 million a year in sales taxrevenue. But Behringer said the public paysfor that sales tax now, in the form of theproperty tax revenue that usually supportspublic libraries. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park), chair of the division, expressed support for thebill. \"Libraries are probably the most value [tax- payers] get for their tax dollars,\" she said. The bill now moves to the full Taxes Com- mittee. Light rail transit Opponents of a bill that would provide a $106 million bonding request for a light railtransit (LRT) system told the finance divisionof the House Transportation and Transit Com-mittee Feb. 3 that LRT would lead to theruination of the local bus system.15 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYLisa Lee, of Minneapolis, said LRT would create a \"rigid, limited form of service\" thatwould become an expensive proposition inthe long run. Opponents said the plan would create trans- portation that only moves people from thesuburbs to downtown, but forgets about busriders. LRT typically serves urban-suburbanmarkets with short distances between stations. But Peter McLaughlin, chair of the Metro- politan LRT Joint Powers Board, said, \"It'stime to think beyond the strategies that havebeen pursued in this region in the past 20years, strategies that have resulted in a one-third drop of people riding the bus.\" Sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL- St. Paul), the bill ( HF2561 ) would appropri- ate $100 million to match federal and otherlocal funding for the $370 million construc-tion of a light rail project from downtownMinneapolis to Minneapolis-St. Paul Interna-tional Airport and the Mall of America. A total of $200 million would come from federal transit capital funds. Of the remaining Vehicle registration Minneapolis police officer William Lundquist said used automobiles involved incrimes are often improperly registered, andthe paper trail often stops with the previous,law-abiding owner. A bill that would suspend or revoke a ve- hicle registration if the buyer fails to apply fora new certificate of title within 10 days of thesale was approved by the House Transporta- tion and Transit Committee Feb. 2. The bill now moves to the committee's fi- nance division. Lundquist told of hit-and-run incidents, traffic violations, and gas station driveoffs in-volving cars that were never registered follow-ing a private sale. Often, a law-abiding personwho sold a car was still listed as its owner. The bill ( HF719 ), sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), would require statemotor vehicle title forms to contain a separate\"notice of sale.\" The vehicle's title numberand identification number would be printedon the notice. The bill would exempt a seller from dam- ages involving a vehicle after the sale if theseller completes and mails the notice of salewithin a week of the transaction. The bill also would authorize the Depart- ment of Public Safety to suspend or revoke avehicle registration if the new owner fails toapply for a new certificate within 10 days of thepurchase.$70 million, $30 million has already been spent locally on planning and infrastructure andanother $40 million in local funding is to beraised. The remaining $6 million in the $106 mil- lion bill would go to study expansion of thesystem into St. Paul and other corridors. The LRT spending is not included in Gov. Arne Carlson's bonding proposal or his supple-mental budget request. The bill is expected to be considered again this session. The administration ofMinnesota's first andonly bachelor to serveas governor did not lastlong. Gov. Winfield Hammond, known as \"a scholar in poli-tics,\" was elected in 1914 and died in 1915before the end of his first year of service. \"Hammond was a good governor, but had little chance to make a record,\" oneobserver commented. Hammond, the state's 18th governor, was born in Southboro, Mass., in 1863.During his lifetime, he would work as ateacher, prosecuting attorney, high schoolprincipal, superintendent of schools, con-gressman, and governor. He came to Minnesota in 1884, shortly after graduating from Dartmouth Collegein Hanover, N.H., and settled in St. James,Minn., where he began a career in educa-tion. Hammond was principal of the highschool in Mankato, Minn., and later thepresident of the St. James School Board. In1895, he became superintendent of schoolsin Madelia, Minn. In his spare time, Hammond studied law, passed the bar, and became a lawyer.He also became active in Democratic poli-tics. Hammond ran for the U.S. House inGov. Hammond known as 'scholar in politics' Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District in1892 but was beaten by Republican JohnLind, who also later served as governor. Not until 1906 did Hammond take an- other shot at Congress, but that time hewon. In Washington, D.C., he became amember of the important House Ways andMeans Committee and was quickly recog-nized as a party leader. In 1914, the Democrats persuaded him to run for governor, and although he re-mained at work in Congress and did littlecampaigning, Hammond beat RepublicanWilliam Lee by more than 12,000 votes. The temperance movement held center stage in the election, and Hammond \u2014labeled a \"wet,\" or prohibition opponent \u2014 won, in large part, because of his viewson the matter, historians note. However, Hammond was not extremely outspoken on the issue. He paid the mat-ter little attention in his inaugural ad-dress. Instead, he encouraged theLegislature not to spend a lot of timediscussing temperance because so muchtime and energy had already been devotedto the issue. Still, soon after he took office, the Leg- islature gave counties the authority to regu-late saloons outside cities. There was little time for much else dur- ing Hammond's stay in office. Hammond was 52 years old when he died of a sudden stroke Dec. 30, 1915,while in Clinton, La., on personalbusiness. \"He was the highest minded man I ever knew,\" Charles Andrist, Hammond's sec-retary, said then. \"Every question was de-cided on the basis as to whether it wasright or wrong, not whether it was expedi-ent or advisable politically.\" Hammond's body was returned by train for burial in Mount Hope Cemetery in St.James. He was succeeded by Lt. Gov. J.A.A.Burnquist. Photo from Men of Minnesota, R. L Polk & Co.Gov. Winfield Hammond16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998By Jim Thielman After James T. Clark's father passed away, Clark found a copy of a letter that eventuallyinspired him to consider public office. The letterwas written by Clark's father to then-president Ronald Reagan. \"My father was proud of his World War II ser-vice and his work as amember of the Rotary,and he wrote to Presi-dent Reagan how he wasa great believer in thedemocratic process and a great waver of the American flag,\" Clark (R-Springfield) recalled. \"My father wanted toknow how he could continue to contribute tohis country now that he was retired. \"I don't know if President Reagan re- sponded, or what course my father wouldhave taken.\" Clark's father passed away shortly after the letter was written. But in a sense, Clark picked up the baton. Before reading the letter, Clark's vision as apublic servant was uncertain. However, Clarksoon began to work on political campaigns toget involved in the political process. \"Before I read my father's letter, public office was never a goal or an aspiration ofmine,\" Clark said. When the late Rep. Barb Vickerman died of cancer last December, Clark was approachedby state Republicans, and his collision with apolitical career began. He won the party's endorsement to face DFLer Bonnie McKnight in a special election.Clark then won overwhelmingly at the pollsJan. 20 by a 3,864 to 1,874 margin. Representing a Minnesota district in the House was something the marketing majorfrom Scarsdale, N.Y., never imagined. Heearned his undergraduate degree at Iona Col-New members . . . Clark picks up baton, advances father's civic desire lege in New Rochelle, N.Y., a suburb known ashome to television's Rob and Laura Petrie on\"The Dick Van Dyke\" show. He later gradu-ated cum laude from Thomas M. Cooley LawSchool in Lansing, Mich. But his politicalbaseline was set years before he became anhonors law student and assistant editor of thelaw review at Cooley. \"When I was a senior in high school, I watched Ronald Reagan's acceptance speech,\"Clark said, \"and I think that crystallized mypolitical philosophy. It sparked my interest inpolitics.\" Clark worked on political campaigns for former President George Bush and U.S. Sen.Rod Grams, but he hadn't considered a cam-paign of his own until party members beck-oned. After talking with his wife, Cara, thedecision was made. \"I have an eight-month-old daughter, and we wanted to be sure that I would be able tohave enough time to be a good father andhusband,\" he said. Along with being a good parent, he empha- sized he wants to keep the channels of com-munication open to his \"neighbors,\" whomhe emphasized are not simply \"constituents.\" \"Springfield is a small town of 2,300 people,\" Clark said. \"About 60 of them were here forthe swearing-in ceremony. In a town of thatsize, they're not your constituents but yourfriends and neighbors, and I know alreadythey will certainly pick up the phone.\" Clark says it was partially his desire to know his neighbors that brought the couple to Min-nesota. His wife is an Iowa native, with rela-tives in Minnesota. \"Minnesota is an ideal environment to raise a family,\" Clark said. \"New York is a nice placeto visit.\" Clark said the main complaint he hears from his friends and neighbors is \"over-regu-lating and mandating\" by the government.\"The one thing I want is permanent tax reduction,\" he said. \"That will be what we'rehere to work on. What the government hasdone is overtaxed citizens. We have a $1.3billion surplus in this state, and this is not thegovernment's money. It's the citizen's money.It's my neighbors' money. Getting their moneyback to them is the one issue I will continue towork on.\" Clark will serve on the House Health and Human Services Committee and its financedivision, the House Regulated Industries andEnergy Committee, and the House GeneralLegislation, Veterans Affairs and ElectionsCommittee. \"It's been hectic,\" he said. \"I've only been here a couple days and there's no trainingperiod. But there have been other representa-tives who have taken me under their wing.\" And there are always thoughts of his father. Secured on Clark's key ring is a thin piece ofmetal that identified a military man in WorldWar II. \"Something I always carry around with me is my father's dog tag,\" Clark said. \"I wasrubbing it the other day as I was walkingtoward the Capitol. It was a very satisfyingfeeling to me. I know my father would be veryproud of what I'm trying to do here.\" District 23A Top concern: \"We are blessed to have a $1.3 billion surplus. My top priority is to return thismoney to the taxpayers in the form of apermanent tax reduction. This money is not thegovernment's money. It is your neighbors'money and my neighbors' money.

Arne Carlsontold lawmakers during hiseighth and final annual as-sessment. Still, he outlined aplan for improvement that includes increased funding for higher educa-tion, further property tax reforms, and othernew programs. \"We are stronger financially, we're more pros- perous and better prepared to take on the futurethan ever before in history,\" he told a jointsession of the Legislature during his State of theState address in the House chamber Feb. 4. Throughout the speech he credited biparti- san cooperation and partnerships with theprivate sector for helping his administrationturn its 1991 inherited budget deficit of $1.8billion into this year's forcast surplus of $1.3million. Carlson will retire from public officeat the end of his term this year. \"We would not be talking about [a] surplus today had we not cast \u2014 and had you notupheld \u2014 some 330 major vetoes, blocking. . . new taxes, spending, and fees,\" he toldlegislators. He cited, as evidence of excellence, areas where he said Minnesota now leads thenation. \"We have become a national model for welfare reform,\" he said, adding that this year8,550 fewer Minnesota families rely on wel-fare than did last year. He also said that property tax reforms and a decrease in workers' compensation premi-ums have created a favorable climate for busi-ness, spurring job growth. But he called education reform \u2014 includ- ing the implementation of basics skills testingand the funding of classroom technology \u2014the area he finds most meaningful. \"We challenged the status quo and suc- ceeded,\" he said. \"We are now making deci-sions based on what is best for the children,not the educational bureaucracy.\" Outlining his agenda for the coming year, however, the governor included only threeeducational priorities: providing private schoolvouchers, creating residential boarding acad-emies, and funding colleges and universities. Vouchers for private schools, he said, would allow families to send their children to theschool that best serves their needs. \"I will fight to see that every single family in this state has the same educational choices fortheir children as the president, vice president,State of the State address . . . Gov. Carlson calls the state of the state 'excellent' and members of Congress,\" he said. His proposal to create Minnesota's first state-run residential academies for at-risk stu-dents would help keep potential trouble-mak-ers out of the criminal justice system, he said\u2014 and thereby save the state money in thelong run. \"We need to find a way to give kids who have spent years bouncing around the fostercare system a sense of permanency and a placeto succeed,\" he said. He did not mention hisown years as a scholarship student at a Con-necticut boarding school. Also on the issue of education, the governor described the higher education system as thestate's engine of job growth. \"Never in our history has Minnesota needed higher education more than today,\" he said.And never have there been \"as many compel-ling reasons to justify bonding requests of$252 million for the University of Minnesotaand $167 million for the Minnesota StateColleges and Universities.\" He applauded MnSCU's successful part- nerships with private industry and stressedthe importance of building those programs totrain students to enter the state's high-growthindustries \u2014 including computer software,health, graphics, manufacturing, and taconiteproduction. He also stressed the importance of strong research at the U of M and of statewide medi-cal advances. \"I want to make us . . . the lead state in the world in the development of medical technol-ogy,\" he said. In addition to funding higher education tofoster job growth, Carlson said he wants to see property tax rates further compressed to pro-mote business. His budget proposes a reduc-tion in the commercial and industrial propertytax rate. \"While this proposal will not cost homeowners one dime more, it will grow jobsand our economy,\" he said. He added that under his plan, the state would be able to extend this year's propertytax relief program \u2014 residents will recoverabout 20 percent of their 1997 property taxesas a rebate this year \u2014 through 1999. Carlson also called on lawmakers to be fis- cally cautious considering the current eco-nomic upheaval in Asia. \"I repeat my call for an Asian market reserve account to cushion any potential blow to ourbudget from the turmoil in these nations,\" hesaid. His budget proposal calls for the state toset aside more than $200 million to brace forpotential problems resulting from economicstruggles in Asia. But, he said, it's essential to recognize is- sues beyond the \"bread and butter\" ones of ahealthy economy, lower taxes, and high-qual-ity jobs . \"We also value that which enriches our soul \u2014 all those things ranging from the arts to ourgreat outdoors,\" he said He called for support of his \"Access to the Outdoors\" initiative, and, specifically, of thecontroversial plan to build a veterans memo-rial park in Duluth, with the now-mothballedU.S.S.

The governor wrapped up his speech with an appeal for compassion toward those inneed. \"I want all of our children to grow up in a society that focuses on opportunity ratherthan entitlement,\" he said. DFL leaders in the House and Senate ap- plauded what Gov. Arne Carlson said Feb. 4 inhis last State of the State address, but there wassome criticism over what he didn't say. Speaking to a joint session of the Legislature in the House chamber, Carlson called for acommitment to high-tech education and high-tech jobs. He also pushed for private schoolvouchers and residential academies for at-riskyouth. \"I appreciate his call for higher education funding,\" said House Speaker Phil Carruthers(DFL-Brooklyn Center). But the speaker questioned Carlson's lack of attention to public schools. \"What about the 850,000 school children in the state?\" Carruthers asked. \"That's some-thing the Democrats will work for. We shouldbe concerned about what the future will por-tend. We've got to work to improve K-12education.\" House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) said the final words of the governor'sspeech resounded for him. Carlson ended by saying that he hoped that a disadvantaged child of today would some-day have the chance to stand in his place.And he urged support of continuing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome research \u2014 an effort spear-headed by his wife, Susan. He said that proactive programs like that research and his proposal for boarding schoolswill contribute to the health of future genera-tions. \"We have to realize that all parents are notequipped to be good parents,\" he said. He spoke of his desire to look back on his administration as one that offered \"succeed-ing generations the opportunity to genuinelypursue history. \"It's my prayer that one day a young person who we have helped will be standing here asgovernor.\" House and Senate leaders react to governor's speech Sviggum said, \"I think we all have dreams about the future of our children. The questionis: Does government need to spend more onchildren? We want to empower parents in thisrole, not just the educational bureaucracy.\" He said the governor didn't appear to be as fiscally prudent as in the past. It was the \"fiscalmanagement of the last few years that allowedhim to make this speech. This speech hadmuch more of a spending theme to it,\" Sviggumsaid. But Sviggum said Republicans embrace Carlson's overall vision to strengthenMinnesota's higher education system andmake it a leader in the area of medical andbiological research. \"It's the total size of the budget that we have a problem with,\" Sviggum said. \"It's just toolarge.\" Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL- Erskine) said the governor has a long list ofgoals for the final year of his administration. \"That doesn't necessarily mean he's going to get everything he wants,\" Moe said. \"Ourjob is to look forward into the 21st century.\"And Moe said some of the governor's sugges-tions originally came from the DFL. \"But that'sOK because I think it indicates in the final analysis we worked together,\" he said. House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL- Fulda) said he would have liked more from thegovernor about the rural and agriculturaleconomy. \"Small businesses are the greatest job cre- ators for the state,\" Winter said. \"I wanted tosee more emphasis put on our economy ofagriculture in Minnesota. People all across thestate depend on that.\" Carruthers was asked to sum up Carlson's tenure as governor. \"I think he's done a goodjob. Certainly, he's somebody who cares deeplyabout the state of Minnesota. We've cut prop-erty taxes, we've reformed the welfare sys-tem,\" Carruthers said. One thing the governor did not mention in his speech was a possible new stadium for theMinnesota Twins, who are threatening to moveto North Carolina without one. A bill for anew stadium has been introduced. \"It's not a high priority,\" Carruthers said.\"At this point, it's like any other bill; it's been introduced,\" Winter said. Continued from page 17 can zoom in and create havoc in places thathave become sanctuaries,\" she said. Each year, Perry sends out an informal loon watchers survey. Her latest survey includedquestions about loon sightings and nestinghabits as well as an addendum asking aboutthe frequency of boats and other watercraftuse. The response Perry received from concerned loon watchers in Aitkin, Cass, and Crow Wingcounties reinforced her fears: 54 percent saidPWCs are negatively affecting the loons ontheir lakes. \"This is the state's playground, and this is the heart of loon country, \" Perry said. \"Wehave a clash here.\"Continued from page 4 Jim Medema of the Jet Sporters Association of Minnesota said that it would be unfair tocrowd the larger lakes with a ban on smallerlakes. The association is also against a provision in the bill that says a PWC could be operated onlyat slow speed between the hours of 8 a.m. and10 a.m. and 7 p.m. to sunset. \"This provision would harm everyone who actually has a day job,\" Medema said. Although noise is a problem, he said, it can be resolved by changing rider habits throughenforcement, education, and improved tech-nology. Medema said his group would support a mandatory education program and an in-creased no-wake zone.\"The current state of affairs is not OK, but we don't want unfair restrictions,\" Medemasaid. \"Until we've given education and mediapublicity a chance, it is unfair to considerstatewide bans. \"Just because somebody turns on a PWC does not mean the day is ruined, that fisher-men have to go in, that swimmers are afraid toswim.\" The bill now moves to the Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture FinanceCommittee. 19 February 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Nick HealyState Capitol architect Cass Gilbert's grand vision for the University of Minnesotacampus was never fully realized. Perhaps it never really could have been. After all, Gilbert's plans for elaborate ter- races, gardens, and Greek amphitheaters run-ning between a domed auditorium at one endof the mall and the Mississippi River at theother would have required a budget as spec-tacular as the architect's drawings. Still, the spirit of Gilbert's 1908 \"General Plan for Laying Out the Grounds and Locat-ing the Buildings on the Campus of the Uni-versity of Minnesota\" often guided subsequentdevelopment of the mall. An exhibition of Gilbert's campus drawings and plans runs from Feb. 6 to March 22 in theWilliam G. Shepherd Room at the WeismanArt Museum on the U of M campus. The exhibition \"provides a look at the ideas and perceptions of campus planners when theuniversity's landscape was raw material andshows how they dealt with this landscapeagainst the changing needs of the students andthe expanding institution,\" said Carole Zellie,one of two curators for the display, which iscalled \"An Enduring Emblem: Cass Gilbertand the Plans for the University of Minne-sota.\" The museum show is particularly timely right now. The condition of the campus malland its overall importance to the universityhave drawn new attention in recent monthsfrom university and state leaders. Mark Yudof, the university's new presi- dent, has made restoration of the campus malland improvement of campus buildings top priorities for the university. Lawmakers thisyear are considering whether to finance thefirst phase of Yudof's four-year $776 millionplan for capital improvements at the U of M. This year's proposed $252 million bonding package for the university would providemoney to improve key buildings on the Min-neapolis campus, including major projects atWalter Library and Ford Hall, both on themall. \"The exhibit is a tangible reminder of the value in setting a vision for a place so that theessential character of the place \u2014 here at theUniversity of Minnesota campus \u2014 is pre-served even as changes are made,\" said ThoraCartlidge, the exhibit's other curator. The exhibit of Gilbert's U of M drawings also is another sign of a resurgence of interestin the architect, who was considered a na-tional leader in his field during the early yearsof this century. Gilbert is best known outside of Minnesota as the architect of the U.S. Supreme Court,The U.S. Customs House, and the WoolworthBuilding, the latter two located in New York. But in Minnesota, Gilbert is recalled as the designer of the State Capitol, the MinneapolisFederal Reserve Building, and numeroushomes and churches in and around St. Paul. Gilbert grew up in St. Paul and practiced architecture in the city for 27 years. He won adesign competition for the Minnesota Capitolin 1895, and that event began his career de-signing important, well-known buildings forgovernment and business. \"He used art, sculpture, and color all to-Cass Gilbert . . . Exhibit shows architect's influence on U of M campus gether to make a nice, smaller \u2014 so to speak \u2014public building,\" said Carolyn Kompelien,manager of the Capitol Historic Site. \"It's avery well-done building, and it's held in veryhigh esteem as far as its architectural design.This building was what really launched him inhis career.\" By the time Gilbert entered the competition to design the U of M campus mall, he hadoffices in New York and St. Paul, and he hadbeen awarded the commission for the U.S.Customs House. Gilbert's design for the Minnesota campus was modeled on Columbia University, whichitself was patterned after Thomas Jefferson'splan for the University of Virginia. The contest-winning plan was considered too costly by the U of M Board of Regents,which eventually dismissed Gilbert in 1910.Not a single building on the campus mall wasdesigned by Gilbert, but as the exhibit demon-strates, he had a great influence on his succes-sors. The exhibition includes the original draw- ings of the designers of existing buildings onthe campus mall along with the Gilbert draw-ings, and the documents reveal the impact ofGilbert's work. And the exhibition is another step in the rediscovery of Gilbert, whose style had passedout of fashion by the time of his death in 1934,and the renewed celebration of his work. \"There are a lot of people who have come to appreciate his classical designs,\" Kompeliensaid. For more information about the Gilbert exhibition, call (612) 625-9494. Image courtesy of the University ArchivesThis is how the University of Minnesota campus would have looked if architect Cass Gilbert's contest-winning plans had been fol lowed. The ambitious designs were not used, but Gilbert's influence on the campus remains evident today.20 SESSION WEEKLY / February 6, 1998HF3000-HF3448 In the Hopper . . .

Wilson came to the CapitolFeb. 9 to support funding for a proposed African-American arts complex. \u2014Photo by Tom OlmscheidINSIDE Highlights ....................................................................... 28 Printedonre cycledpaperMinnesota House of Representatives February 13, 1998 Volume 15, Number 4 Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson came to the Capitol on Feb. 9 to garner financial support for a new African-American theater andmusic complex. He is the accomplished creator of the nationally knownplays \"Fences,\" \"The Piano Lesson,\" and other successful productions onBroadway and across the country. Wilson's first play was produced in 1981 at St. Paul's Penumbra Theatre, which is now seeking funding to expand. He touted the theateras the most outstanding African-American theater in the country. He toldlegislators that Penumbra's role could be expanded with the creation of an arts center that would help to interpret the African-American experience. Legislators greet hundreds of important individuals and groups who come as guests or to support an important issue. These visitors are received in the House chamber and itsprivate retiring room. Wilson's visit may have broken the record for the number ofindividuals who requested to meet the famous guest in the private area behind thechamber. Surrounded by the room's quiet grandeur, Wilson stood before the ornate fireplace and graciously greeted the many people who wanted to take a photograph with him. So many members, staff, and guests lined up that the number equaled the receptions held for the 1990 U.S. presidential hopefuls who breezed through, and the 1991 formal visitby then-Czechoslovakia President Vaclav Havel. Historical records do not indicate how many people greeted Teddy Roosevelt in 1909 when he came to honor the establishment of the Superior National Forest. But it is notedthat others with national affiliation were also visitors. These included Vice PresidentHubert Humphrey; Vice President Walter Mondale; Chief Justice of the U.S. SupremeCourt Warren Burger; presidential candidate Harold Stassen; presidential candidateEugene McCarthy; and civil rights activist and former Georgia State Sen. Julian Bond. Like Wilson and recent visitor Minnesota Orchestra's Eiji Oue, other well-known members of the arts have come to the House members' sanctum. Visiting artists in the pastincluded opera contralto Marion Anderson, Minnesota author and Nobel Peace Prizewinner Sinclair Lewis, and Hollywood producer Otto Preminger, Sister Kenny, Joe Louis,James J. Hill, and Will Rogers are just a few other well-known figures who have come tomeet House members. With all of its formal decor, the retiring room on a late session night can be totally different from the site where a prominent playwright like August Wilson was received. Inthe last days of a legislative session, it is not uncommon to see pizza sharing in progress,or a wide assortment of oriental food being passed around. One might also see a couple ofmembers resting on the original leather benches as they wait to vote on some long andintricate bill. Obviously, a visit to the House retiring room is a public, yet private \"behind the scenes\" adventure. \u2014 LeClair Grier LambertAugust Wilson3 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Matt Wetzel Julie Jensen, her husband, and her six chil dren live on a piece of land near Olivia inRenville County. Sometimes, family members wake up with headaches, nausea, and upper respiratoryproblems. Jensen's daughter sometimes hastrouble keeping her balance. When the windchanges, Jensen said it smells almost like aseptic tank or rotten eggs. Lisa Davies also lives in Renville County, and her residential problem is flies, which shesaid swarm around her home in great num-bers. The children can't play on the swings, thefamily can't use the grill, they can't entertainguests, and they have to be very careful aboutopening the door, Davies said. And what do Jensen and Davies have in common? They both live near feedlots \u2014 verylarge ones. Both Renville County residentstestified on feedlot legislation in recent daysbefore House committees. Renville County is home to the cooperative pork producer ValAdco and the liquid eggproducer Golden Oval Egg. And what thoseproducers have in common is that both oper-ate large feedlots. A feedlot is a lot or building or combination of lots and buildings used to feed, breed, raise,and hold animals. Feedlots are designed as aconfinement area. Manure can accumulate,so underneath the feedlots are manure basins,often made of clay or earth. There are anestimated 45,000 feedlots in Minnesota. An increasing number of feedlots are found on agricultural operations that are not simplysmall family farms where the hogs and cattlegraze and the soybean and cornfields stretchout forever. Competition and consolidation has cut down the number of family farms and in-creased the number of so-called factory farms,which also increases the number and size offeedlots and the number of complaints frompeople who live near them. But some in rural Minnesota believe that the larger farms are needed to keep agriculturealive, that the smaller farms can no longercompete, and that agriculture has to changewith the times. They say they are fighting tokeep their families in farming. Responding to the complaints about feed- lots, legislators have introduced bills trying toWhen the wind blows . . . Lawmakers develop three plans to tackle feedlot woes Testimony comes from both sides of the fenceconcerning a bill that would limit the size offeedlots and require farmers to pay forenvironmental impact statements before gainingstate permits to expand the size of a feedlot. RexOberheim, left, a Martin County farmer, testified in favor of the proposal and Jim Quakenbush,right, a Stevens County farmer, testified against the measure before the House Environment andNatural Resources Committee Feb. 10.address the problems, and three significantfeedlot proposals are advancing in the House. The bills include a measure that would place a moratorium on feedlots while a GenericEnvironmental Impact Statement (GEIS) isdone, a bill that would provide for trainingand licensing of animal waste technicians, anda bill that would ban earthen or clay-linedmanure storage facilities and establish a live-stock industry and environmental steeringcommittee. Also, Gov. Arne Carlson's supplementalbudget calls for a GEIS to be conducted on feedlots. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), him- self a farmer, has introduced two bills ( HF3441 and HF3320 ) related to the issue. HF3441 is called the \"Living with Live- stock\" feedlot bill. The bill would require thatafter March 1, 2000, those who manage andapply animal wastes hold valid animal wastetechnician licenses issued by the Departmentof Agriculture. Most family farmers would beexempted. Peterson's bill also would prohibit the issu- ance of a permit for clay, earthen, or plastic-lined animal waste lagoons. And no permitwould be issued for a feedlot with a designcapacity of 1,000 animal units or more, unlessthe applicant has a federal permit under theClean Water Act. (An animal unit is a mea-surement of waste produced by a specific spe-cies. One animal unit is equal to one slaughtersteer or heifer, 2.5 hogs over 55 pounds, or 100chickens.) Peterson's bill also would establish a state- wide contingency plan to contain and cleanup animal waste spills, a county-by-countyinventory of feedlots, and an option for coun-ties to adopt and update new feedlot ordi-nances. It also calls for a GEIS. HF3320 would place a moratorium on any new permits for construction of feedlots of750 animal units or more or the expansion ofFeedlots, such as the one these hogs occupy, are fast becoming the most controversial topic in ruralMinnesota, and legislators are struggling to come up with a solution.4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998By Sandy Donovan Former Rep. Paul Ogren, a DFLer who served an Aitkin-area district, says there'sno job in the world like being a legislator. \"It was utterly fascinating,\" he said. \"Your job is to champion people's needsand concerns. That's a rare privilege andit's very exciting.\" During his 12 years in the House (1980- 1992), Ogren championed the health-careneeds of Minnesotans as an architect ofMinnesotaCare, the comprehensive re-form package passed by the 1992Legislature. Today, he continues to work in that field at Health Strategies Group, a privatehealth-care consult-ing firm, and said hehopes to see the statefurther improve ac-cess to care for low-income citizens. \"There are far too many people whodon't go to the doctorsimply because theycan't afford it,\" hesaid.\"Today,MinnesotaCare helpsover 100,000 people ayear, and I think that'smarvelous. But I re-gret that so much ofthe money raised in 1992 under theMinnesotaCare Act went to pay for priorand other objectives.\" Although Ogren is perhaps best remem- bered for his work on health-care reform,he says he is equally proud of his efforts increating the Fond du Lac CommunityCollege in 1990. While in the House, healso chaired the powerful Taxes Commit-tee. And although he said he would not have missed his years in the House, he alsoOgren enjoys private sector,recalls 'passion' of lawmaking said he is enjoying life in the private sector. \"It's terrific having a private, unlisted telephone number,\" he said. \"And havinga personal private life that cannot be in-truded on at the whim of constituents issomething to enjoy.\" After retiring from the Legislature, Ogren campaigned for the DFL guberna-torial nomination for the first few monthsof 1993. He pulled out of the race in Mayof that year, citing the potential that hiscandidacy would have jeopardized the ca-reer of his wife, Associate Justice SandraGardebring of the Minnesota SupremeCourt. Judges are prohibited by state codefrom participating in partisan politics. Ogren then spent several years as execu- tive director of the St. Paul-based Centerfor Health Care Access and Reform, anational nonprofit group that gatheredhealth-care information and assisted withpolicy crafting. Today, he said, he's happy in the \"for- profit sector,\" occasionally thinking backto the \"raw vitality of legislating, the op-portunity to advocate with absolute andexuberant passion.\" open-air manure storage structures untilJuly 1, 2000, or after the EnvironmentalQuality Board (EQB) has given to the Legisla-ture a timeline and cost for doing a GEIS. A third bill ( HF3421 ) comes from House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda), alsoa farmer. Winter's bill would forbid permits to in- crease or establish feedlot capacities greaterthan 1,875 hogs, 15,000 calves, 533 dairy cows,or 750 feeder cattle, unless the applicant getsan environmental impact statement. That cancost between $50,000 and $100,000. His bill would also ban open-air, below- ground earthen or clay-lined manure storagefacilities after July 1, 1998. Existing structureswould have to be replaced by June 30, 2001,under the bill. Winter's bill also creates a livestock indus- try environmental steering committee madeup of legislators, farmers, and environmental-ists to perform a GEIS, which would examinelong-term effects of the livestock industry andits effects on the state, including the effects onenvironment, the family farm, and the roles oflocal government. Jeff Gresser, who is a construction supervi- sor from Martin County, said Winter's billwould hurt. He said he has been busy helping construct feedlots and his business has been successful.He testified against the bill Feb. 10 before theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee. \"If that would shut off, people would be laid off and people wouldn't have jobs. That wouldcertainly be devastating if that happened,\" hesaid. Linda King, an Olmsted County farmer, agreed, testifying against Peterson's morato-rium bill, HF3320 , which also was heard Feb. 10 by the Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee. She said any farmer inbusiness today has to expand and has to investa lot of money. \"Minnesota's agriculture economy does af- fect every citizen,\" she said. \"The Minnesotafarmer will not go back to the back-breakingoperation of the past. Minnesota farmers andtheir profits are Minnesota's greatest treasure.\" Both HF3320 and Winter's HF3421 bill were approved by the Environment and Natu-ral Resources Committee. Both bills moved tothe House Agriculture Committee. Peterson was very passionate in his presen- tation of HF3441 , the \"Living with Livestock\" bill, which was approved by the AgricultureCommittee Feb. 9 and the House Local Gov-ernment and Metropolitan Affairs Commit-tee Feb. 11. \"I believe the middle ground is still being worked,\" Peterson said. \"I think I've workedhard on [the bill], and I've got some soul in this thing. If we lose the ability to keep work-ing toward a middle ground by defeating thistonight, in my heart of hearts, I believe ruralMinnesota will never be the same. You will beowned by the corporations. \"I want my kids to own agriculture. I don't want them working for the country store. Idon't believe it does any good in rural Minne-sota,\" he said.Rep. Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) Livestock\" bill wouldgo too far. \"It's a really important issue to my district too,\" Kraus said. \"With so many good peopleon each side of the issue, why couldn't we havehad more middle ground?\" HF3441 now moves the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. Former Rep. Paul Ogren, the architect of the MinnesotaCareprogram, is in the private sector now, but he's still working onhealth issues.5 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 5 - 12, 1998 BANKING A student-run bank Accounting students at St. Peter High School in southern Minnesota may have a chance tosee what things are like in a real bank. Legisla-tion advancing in the House would allow theirschool district to sponsor a student-run bank. A bill ( HF2582 ) sponsored by Rep. Ruth Johnson (DFL-St. Peter) would establish aschool bank as part of an educational pro-gram. The bill was approved Feb. 11 by theHouse Financial Institutions and InsuranceCommittee. Besides the classroom instruction, students would operate a student bank, perhaps work-ing with four St. Peter banks that have showninterest in lending a hand. The students would handle savings accounts for other students at the high school and makesmall loans, according to the high school'splans. Students would have to do many things that folks at city banks must do: maintain accuraterecords, establish positive customer relations,and make tough decisions. The aim is that upon completion of the course, students would have a better under-standing of saving, establishing credit, andother personal finance responsibilities. The bank would be run by students in grades 11 and 12. Jon Kautt, left, a senior at St. Peter High School, and George Shoenborn, an instructor in business,accounting, and banking at the school, testify insupport of a bill that would establish aneducational bank project in their school.Mark Haukoos, a student who will be taking the banking course, told committee membershe is eager for the chance to be part of thestudent-run bank. \"It teaches [students] about how financial institutions work; it puts them in real posi-tions. It gives them experience in making loanpayments and taking out loans,\" he said. Lawmakers approved a similar measure in 1997 that allows students at Bemidji HighSchool to operate a bank serving other stu-dents and employees of the school. Johnson's bill now moves to the House floor. Bank service charges A bill that would limit certain bank service charges has stalled in a House committee. The bill ( HF1278 ), sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), was rejected Feb. 10 by theHouse Financial Institutions and InsuranceCommittee. The proposal would limit checking account service charges at state-chartered banks andwould try to persuade federally chartered fi-nancial institutions to limit their checkingaccount service charges. The state can't directly regulate federally chartered financial institutions, but the billwould use state and local deposits and loanprograms as incentives to get them to complywith fee limits. In other words, the federallychartered banks could not be depositories forstate money if they didn't follow the limits onfees. The committee rejected a heavily amended version of Clark's bill. Earlier versions of thelegislation would have placed a limit on thecharges for money orders and penalties forchecking account overdrafts. Clark's initialproposal also would have encouraged banksto establish low-fee checking accounts andprevented banks from clearing the largest checkfirst when a customer is overdrawn. The latest version of the bill has only the limit on service charges. Some committee members tried to breathe life back into the bill the day after the proposalwas rejected by the committee. But that effort\u2014 led by Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Newport)\u2014 came up short. A quorum was not presentto vote on Marko's motion to reconsider thebill.Women and credit history A bill advancing in the House would ad- dress concerns of divorced women and wid-ows who are denied loans or credit cardsbecause they don't have an individual credithistory. The problem often arises after a divorce or a death because, in many cases, loans andcredit cards were in the husband's name.Women who may have been dutiful borrow-ers suddenly find themselves unable to get acredit card or take out a loan. A bill ( HF2309 ) sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) would attempt torectify that by requiring that creditors con-sider a credit history in the name of theapplicant's spouse and that creditors report acredit history in the name of both spouses.The bill was approved Feb. 11 by the HouseFinancial Institutions and InsuranceCommittee. Don Banks, a staff attorney with Dayton Hudson, argued that the bill would duplicatemuch of what is already in federal law. When a woman applies for credit and is turned down, the creditor must tell her why,and then the woman has a chance to appeal, hesaid. If there's something wrong on the report,she can see about getting it changed. Banks also said the bill would go too far in some areas. \"It would require creditors to give equal weight to a spouse's credit history as much astheir own,\" Banks said. \"The science of how togrant credit is very difficult. We pay actuariesto do that.\" How to grant credit is best left to the indus- try, Banks said. Jim Farnham, a credit bureau lobbyist, said he does not think getting credit is a commonproblem for women. \"We don't see this kind of issue coming up in consumer interviews,\" he said. Leppik said the need for her bill remains.\"We've heard them say the system should work, and in all probability, that is the way itdoes work. Then there are times when anapplicant finds she has no credit history,\" shesaid. \"This [bill] would give that person re-course to state court and small claims court.The applicant still has to establish her owncredit-worthiness.\" The bill now goes to the House floor.6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998 CHILDREN Gang intervention, prevention In many cases, there are only two ways out for gang members \u2014 death or incarceration. That's according to Denise Sjoberg, man- ager of the Weed and Seed Initiative, a pro-gram that assists targeted neighborhoods ineradicating violent crime and illegal drug andgang activity. Sjoberg testified before the Family and Early Childhood Education Finance Division of theHouse Education Committee Feb. 11 in sup-port of a gang prevention and intervention billsponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights). The committee took no ac-tion on the bill. HF3125 would provide funding to local organizations to reach children and youngadults who are either at risk for criminal ganginvolvement or who have expressed interest interminating their gang affiliation. After-school activities, job skill training, and counseling are among the services thatwould be offered to the young people. Sjoberg said the bill is necessary to ensure that \"kids who want out will have options.\" Anthony Carter, coordinator for the Sum- mit-University Weed and Seed program, toldthe panel that children as young as seven arerecruited to act as lookouts during drug deals. \"Gangs recruit like colleges,\" he said.The kids who are most easily lured into gangs are lacking in family and peer relation-ships and spiritual balance, Carter said. Rep. Arlon Lindner (R-Corcoran) ques- tioned the need for another gang-focused pro-gram. There are \"hundreds\" of programs already in place, he said. \"We can't hold somebody'shand for 24 hours a day.\" Most programs are not saving the people who are already in gangs, Carter said, andthere is also a need to heighten awarenessabout existing programs. It's better to spend money on gang preven- tion and intervention, Carter said, before ithas to be spent on the criminal justice system. \"We need to learn how to save lives instead of condemning lives,\" he said. The issue likely will be considered again later this session. Endowment fund for children The latest brain research shows that the road map for successful learning develops longbefore a child heads off to kindergarten. A bill ( HF3167 ) that would create a perma- nent endowment fund to improve the physi-CONSUMERS Marilyn Bell, 9, and her brother Aaron, 4, play on the floor of the Capitol rotunda as their mother,Sharon, rests after a long day of promoting continued funding for Head Start programs beforelawmakers. The family also attended a rally Feb. 11 as part of Minnesota Head Start/State ParentOrganization Legislative Day on the Hill.Head starterscal, intellectual, and emotional developmentof Minnesota's youngest citizens was approvedFeb. 10 by the Early Childhood EducationFinance Division of the House EducationCommittee. Sponsored by Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL- Maplewood), the bill would submit the fol-lowing constitutional amendment to voters inthe 1998 general election: \"Shall the Minne-sota Constitution be amended to create a per-manent endowment fund to enhance thedevelopment of young children through theage of four?\" Research indicates the portions of the brain that control language, emotions, and logicalreasoning develop before the age of five, Slawiksaid. Placing the endowment in the constitution, she said, would create a long-term fundingsource for early childhood education andheighten awareness of the importance of earlybrain development. \"The science is there; the proof is there,\" Jim Koppel, of the Children's Defense Fund,told the panel. \"If there's any chance of ussaving money in the future on social pro-grams, we have to make this investment.\" Possible sources for initial funds for the endowment include surplus dollars in statecoffers, a portion of any proceeds from thestate's tobacco lawsuit, or a temporary to-bacco tax increase. Additional funding could come from tax- deductible contributions from individuals,corporations, and foundations. Glenn Dorfman, of the Minnesota Associa- tion of Realtors, pledged his organization'ssupport in fundraising and recruiting other donors. \"Part of the reason we haven't seen much in the way of returns [on social spending] isbecause we haven't spent the money in theright place,\" he said. HF3167 was later approved by the full Edu- cation Committee and now moves to theHouse Governmental OperationsCommittee. Help for health care consumers When consumers want resolutions to their health care complaints or questions, manydon't know where to turn. Under HF2649 , an office of health care consumer assistance wouldbe created, possibly providing a one-stop cen-ter for consumer needs. \"This is not regulatory; it's advocacy,\" bill sponsor Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls)told the House Health and Human ServicesCommittee Feb. 10. \"It's about navigating thesystem.\" The committee approved the bill, which now moves to the House Financial Institu-tions and Insurance Committee. The bill emerged from the Patient Protec- tion Act of 1997. In part, that act sought toprevent health plans from interfering with thedoctor-patient association and to provide con-sumers with accurate information regardingrelationships between health care providersand health plan companies.7 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWejcman said each health plan has its own internal process for consumer issues, and theprocess can be complicated. Among the bill'ssupporters was Rep. Mary Ellen Otremba(DFL-Long Prairie), whose husband died ofliver cancer in 1997. She agreed the system is\"difficult to solve.\" The proposed office would help patients and enrollees understand and assert their legalrights, get appropriate health care referrals,access the services of other agencies, help en-rollees resolve complaints, and make recom-mendations to health plan companies on waysto streamline their consumer complaint pro-cess. Rep. Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) said the office might be just a \"Band-Aid\" on amessy health care system, and asked who couldpossibly answer the broad range of questionsthe office would likely receive. Wejcman said the governor would appoint a nonpartisan director with broad consumeradvocacy knowledge, and who is qualified toaddress legal, administrative, and public policyissues. The director would have at least ninestaff members, under the bill. Rep. Arlon Lindner (R-Corcoran) said con- sumers are already confused over who to callwith health care questions. Wejcman said withproper public relations, consumers wouldbecome aware of the office and its intent toprovide one main stop to handle and direct allmanner of complaints. Lindner also said the office might relieve health care companies of paying someone todo the job. Wejcman said the new office would require an initial budget of about $700,000. Telemarketing fraud Telemarketing fraud is a $40 billion indus- try that preys on senior citizens, according tothe American Association of Retired Persons(AARP). A bill ( HF2794 ) that would establish an outreach and advocacy network to educatesenior citizens about the dangers of telephonescams was approved Feb. 10 by the HouseCommerce, Tourism and Consumer AffairsCommittee. The network would be facilitated by the attorney general's office working in conjunc-tion with private organizations such as AARPand the Minnesota Senior Federation. \"Education is probably the most important thing we can do for our senior citizens,\" Rep.Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), the bill's spon-sor, said. Doug Davis, an AARP representative, said seniors are particularly vulnerable to phonylotteries and \"can't-miss\" investment schemes. Many senior victims are well-educated, he said, and it's a mistake to think that \"unso-phisticated, sweet old ladies and gentlemen\"are the only ones being conned out of theirsavings. Rep. Doug Reuter (R-Owatonna) ques- tioned the need for the state to fund such aprogram. He said he tells his elderly father to\"just hang up the phone.\" Cass Welsh, a consumer fraud investigator with the attorney general's office, said victimsdo not know how to get off the phone. \"That generation is particularly courteous,\" Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) said. \"Itgoes against the way they were raised to justhang up.\" Ted Robb, president of the Minnesota Telemarketing Manager's Association, said theindustry does not support the bill. \"As geographically remote as we are in Min- nesota,\" he said, \"it would work to our disad-vantage to discourage sales over the telephone.\" Proponents said that honest telemarketers have nothing to worry about. \"This bill will do nothing to hamper legiti- mate telephone solicitations, such as carpetcleaners or siding salesmen,\" Davis said. \"What we are talking about,\" Welsh said, \"is the dark side of the marketplace.\" The bill now moves to the State Govern- ment Finance Division of the House Govern-mental Operations Committee. Debt collectors using aliases Collection agents may give a name when they call to demand payment from debtors,but it isn't necessarily the agent's real name. Under a bill ( HF2510 ) sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), collection agentswould no longer be allowed to operate underassumed names. The bill was approved by the House Com- merce, Tourism and Consumer Affairs Com-mittee Feb. 10. \"The state of Minnesota currently regu- lates, certifies, or licenses 100 professions,\"McElroy said. \"Debt collectors are the onlyprofessionals allowed to use an alias.\" Carol Trebelhorn, president of the Minne- sota Association of Collectors, said the right touse an assumed name was negotiated with theDepartment of Commerce 10 years ago. Currently, debt collectors must register their given and assumed names with the depart-ment. Collectors are required to identify them- selves when they telephone someone, she said,and if there is a complaint, the real name iseasily traced through those records.Aliases are a matter of safety, Trebelhorn said. Two-thirds of the collectors are womenwho make between 65 and 100 calls a day. \"Telephone collectors are frequently placed in hostile situations,\" Trebelhorn said. Although he is sympathetic to their poten- tial vulnerability, McElroy said, other riskyprofessions, such as social work or law en-forcement, are not granted the same anonym-ity. \"I think it's a matter of consistency,\" McElroy said. \"The essence of fairness is con-sistency.\" The bill is headed for the House floor. CRIME Curbing repeated violence A bill that would make \"three strikes and you're out\" the law in Minnesota was debatedFeb. 9 by the House Judiciary Committee. The bill ( HF24 ) would require life impris- onment for criminals convicted of three vio-lent felony-level crimes. Bill sponsor Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka) said that these measures are needed to curbthe rise in repeat violent offenders. \"It doesn't take a brain surgeon to know that someone who is in prison cannot commita crime,\" Weaver said, whose bill is expectedto come up again later this session. A St. Paul business owner whose family has been affected by violent crime testified in sup-port for the bill. The man told the committee that his daugh- ter was kidnapped and raped by a man whohad nine previous felony convictions. Thefather asked that his name be withheld toprotect the identity of his daughter. \"A woman is no longer safe when repeat felony offenders are allowed to return to thestreets,\" the man said. The man told the committee that his daugh- ter was abducted outside her apartment com-plex in Edina and held captive for 10 hoursuntil she finally escaped. During that time, shewas beaten with a tire iron and repeatedlyraped. The man said that his daughter's life has been completely changed since the abduction.She has had to undergo reconstructive surgeryand has to be tested frequently for the HIVvirus because the offender has tested positive.She had to get rid of her apartment and carbecause of the painful memories associatedwith the crime, her father said. \"He took our most precious possession and destroyed her,\" he said. \"If she must live withthis her whole life, why shouldn't he? Rape,8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998 murder, sexual assault \u2014 sentence them to life, not just a few years.\" Weaver attempted to address the concerns of the members of the committee. He said thathis bill was not aimed at petty offenders. Hesaid that it is an attempt to get violent repeatoffenders off the streets. \"I want to emphasize to members that this bill does not count as a third strike shoplift-ing,\" Weaver said. \"We are talking about some-one who is willing to do and is convicted ofthree violent crimes.\" Corrections officials have not released cost projections for the increased sentences. ButWeaver said that keeping violent offenders inprison would save money in the long run. \"When you figure the cost of this bill, you cannot think about it in a vacuum,\" Weaversaid. \"You need to consider it in the perspec-tive of total costs saved by society.\" Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) is also sponsoring a separate bill that also wouldaddress repeat violent offenders. HF2286 would restructure current law that requirestougher penalties for \"career criminals\" andwould reduce the number of violent crimesrequired to receive these harsher sentences. Both bills were laid over for consideration at a later date. Minnesota State Patrol Sergeant RussellWicklund remembers his former colleagueTimothy Bowe, the first Minnesota State Patrolofficer killed in the line of duty since 1978.Bowe was shot to death last year in ruralChisago County while answering a residentialshooting call. Wicklund testified Feb. 6 in favorof a bill that would designate a 14-mile stretchof Trunk Highway 95 as State Trooper TimothyBowe Memorial Highway. The bill wasapproved by the finance division of the HouseTransportation and Transit Committee.Highway memorial Dealing with false allegations In July of 1997, two Richfield police officers were accused of raping a woman during theirpatrol. The charge was found to be false, but,the officers said, the allegations alone werevery damaging. Both officers were cleared of any wrongdo- ing after a two-week investigation by the Min-nesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehensionconcluded that the woman had made up thestory. The officers, who asked that their names not be used, testified before the House Judi-ciary Committee Feb. 6 in support of a bill(HF3035 ) that would provide new penalties for making such false accusations. The officers told the committee that the ordeal was something that they never want toexperience again. \"Some people made the comment that it's just part of my job. Obviously, it's not,\" one ofthe officers said. \"After 24 years, I was ques-tioning whether I should remain in the profes-sion.\" The bill would make it a criminal violation to harass police officers because of the perfor-mance of official duties. The bill also wouldadd police officers to a list of judicial officialswho are covered from retaliatory harassmentunder current law.The committee approved the bill, which is sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls). Dennis Flaherty, executive director of the Minnesota Police Officers Association, saidthat police departments are forced to dealwith such false allegations as part of the job. \"All law enforcement agencies at one time or another have individuals level charges atpolice officers,\" Flaherty said. \"They do it fora wide They're vindictive.They're mad at the cop. They're possibly usingit as a bargaining chip.\" One of the Richfield police officers told the committee that he had only been on the forcefor 14 months when the incident took place.He said he was shocked when he arrived atwork and his commanding officer escortedhim out of the station. \"Here I am a brand new officer and I'm calling a defense attorney. It was really over-whelming,\" he said. \"To this day, I don't thinkI'm as effective a police officer as I was beforethis incident.\" Skoglund told the committee that such false allegations impede the criminal justice pro-cess and wreak havoc on the lives and thefamilies of the officers involved. \"Sex charges seem to last forever,\" Skoglund said. \"You can't seem to wash them off your-self.\" One of the Richfield officers told the com- mittee that he doubted that he would everrecover from the stigma associated with theallegations. \"Professionally, my reputation means more to me than anything, and that reputation istarnished,\" he said. HF3035 is set to be included in this year's omnibus crime bill. Increase in juvenile crime The rise of juvenile crime was a major con- cern expressed to legislators during theOctober 1997 House Mini-Session in Willmar,Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) told membersof the House Judiciary Committee Feb. 6. Now Juhnke is pushing legislation that would change the way juvenile crimes arehandled in the courts. \"We're seeing a dramatic increase in juve- nile crime,\" Juhnke said. \"The ones that con-cern us the most are the repeat offenders \u2014the ones who are doing it over and over again.\" Juhnke's bill ( HF3059 ) would attempt to address such concerns by opening some juve-nile court records and proceedings to the pub-lic. For juveniles under 14 years of age, the bill would make court records available to thepublic if the juvenile is found guilty of a thirdfelony or gross misdemeanor level offense. For juveniles who are 14 years old or older, the bill would open all court hearings to thepublic, regardless of the offense. The recordswould be closed to the public when the juve-nile turns 21. The bill was approved by the committee and is set to be included in this year's omnibuscrime bill. Drive-by shooting penalty A bill that would increase the penalty for committing a drive-by shooting was approvedby the House Judiciary Committee Feb. 6. Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington), sponsor of HF2505 , told the committee that the idea was brought to him by a constituentwhose husband was shot at while driving onInterstate 35W in August 1997. The Roseville teenager who fired the shots was initially charged with a felony level drive-by shooting charge, but eventually pleadeddown to a second-degree assault offense. Delmont told the committee that the con- stituent felt that the severity level of the crime9 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYDEVELOPMENTjustified an increased penalty. Delmont's bill would raise the maximum penalty for firinginto an occupied vehicle from a five-year prisonterm to a 20-year term. HF2505 is scheduled to be included in the omnibus crime bill. Convicted felons with guns Society needs to send the strong message that if you're a convicted felon who is illegallyin possession of a gun, you're going away fora long time, according to Minnesota AttorneyGeneral Hubert H. Humphrey III. Humphrey told the House Judiciary Com- mittee on Feb. 6 that stronger measures arenecessary to keep the streets safe from gunviolence. Humphrey testified before the committee in support of HF2285 , sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls). The bill would increase the mandatory mini- mum prison sentence from 18 months to fiveyears for convicted felons illegally possessing afirearm. \"This measure will send a strong message that gun violence is unacceptable here,\"Humphrey said. The bill was approved by the committee and is set to be included in this year's omnibuscrime bill. Convention center expansion A new proposal to finance the Minneapolis Convention Center expansion was debatedFeb. 12 by the Economic Development Fi-nance Division of the House Economic Devel-opment and International Trade Committee. The bill ( HF1529 ) was laid over and could possibly be included in this year's omnibuseconomic development bill. Last year, a different expansion proposal passed the full Economic Development andInternational Trade Committee, but the mea-sure stalled on the House floor. Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton told the full committee last year that the pro-posal represented a completion of the project. The original plans, which called for nearly 500,000 square feet of floor space, were scaledback to the existing 280,000 after then-Gov.Rudy Perpich vetoed the proposed project inthe 1980s. After state funds were vetoed, thecity paid for the convention center with $350million in bonds, imposing a half-cent salestax to service the debt. Last year's proposal called for the state toappropriate approximately $37 million to be- gin construction with the understanding thata future bonding plan would include the re-maining portion of the estimated $147.5 mil-lion expansion. The new proposal, which was included the governor's 1998 bonding plan, would allowthe city of Minneapolis to issue $175 millionin bonds to cover the design and constructionof the convention center expansion. The statewould issue its own bonds in the amount of$87 million and use those funds to provide agrant to the city of Minneapolis to assist withthe payment on the city bonds. The effect of this arrangement is that there would be no increase in the city's debt servicecosts, thereby protecting its AAA bond rating.The city would be solely responsible for costoverruns or cost savings on the project. The governor's office projects that the $175 million expansion will produce 4,000 newjobs and will generate $4 million annually innew sales tax receipts. Sayles Belton testified this year that the convention center is a statewide economicdevelopment tool because the facility show-cases Minnesota businesses. \"It provides a competitive advantage for Minnesota businesses, not just in the metroarea but all over the state,\" she said. Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), spon- sor of the bill, told the committee that actionwould have to be taken by the Legislature thisyear for the city to be able to issue bonds forthe project. The Economic Development Finance Divi- sion also heard testimony on convention cen- EDUCATIONSCHOOLHouse leaders field questions Feb. 12 from about 60 visiting journalists during the annualMedia Day on the Hill.

Theseprojects also will be considered for inclusionin the omnibus economic development bill. All-day kindergarten Children who attend all-day kindergarten do better throughout their school career thanthose who don't, according to supporters of abill that would phase in a full day of school forall Minnesota kindergartners. HF2763 , sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), was discussed by the K-12 Edu-cation Finance Division of the House Educa-tion Committee Feb. 6. The panel took noaction on the bill. The proposal would provide money to cer- tain schools to implement all-day kindergar-ten programs. Schools would qualify based onthe percentage of students eligible for free orreduced-price lunch, and the number of eli-gible schools would increase annually until2004, when all schools would receive thefunding. The bill would stipulate that in 1999, schools in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Greater Minne-sota would have to have more than 50 percentof their students eligible for the lunch pro-gram to receive the kindergarten funds. Sub-urban schools in the seven-county metro areawould have to have more than 25 percent ofstudents eligible for the lunch program toqualify.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998In 2000, the eligibility cutoff for the two groups would go down to 40 percent and 20percent, respectively. By 2004, all schools inMinnesota would qualify for the all-day kin-dergarten revenue. Qualifying schools would have the option of implementing a full-day kindergarten, andthe schools could offer families a choice be-tween full- or half-day programs. Kindergar-ten attendance would remain optional. Wagenius said the bill is aimed at increasing first-grade preparedness. \"Successful young kids become successful older kids, and they don't end up in the crimi-nal justice system,\" she said. Cheryl Furrer of the Minnesota Education Association said it's appropriate to use someof the forecast budget surplus to develop all-day kindergarten, which several studies haveshown to benefit children. \"It seems like the time is right to make an investment in kids,\" she said. \"Kids represent25 percent of the population, and I ask you,are they worth 25 percent of the budget sur-plus?\" But some lawmakers criticized the plan's differing levels of qualifications for the twogroups of schools. \"My kids are not going to benefit from this,\" Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R-Hastings) said.\"In our district, we have poor families and wehave minorities, but we don't have enough. Sowe're going to exclude them, and I don't thinkthat's fair.\" Wagenius said she also would prefer to see every child in the state have the opportunityto go to full-day kindergarten right away, \"butwe have to recognize that that's not fiscallypossible.\" The division will consider the bill for inclu- sion in this year's omnibus K-12 finance bill. Graduation rule funding Minnesota schools have just about eight months before the state's new graduation re-quirements kick in, and lawmakers are work-ing on plans to get them additional funding tohelp make the new standards effective. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) brought his proposal(HF3610 ) before the K-12 Education Finance Division of the House Education CommitteeFeb. 11. Carruthers' plan would give schools about $13 million in fiscal year 1999 and about $45million in fiscal 2000 and in years thereafter.The money would go directly to schools forstaff development and implementation of thenew requirements. The division took no ac-tion on the bill.\"The purpose is to help all the people in- volved in our education system to implementthe graduation standards,\" he said. Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), the division's chair, said providing schools withmoney to implement the standards is her toppriority this year. \"I believe this year is a critical year,\" she said. \"If we want this major effort to go ahead,I think we have to put some money out there.\" Rep. Leslie Schumacher (DFL-Princeton), a co-sponsor of Carruthers' bill, is also spon-soring a separate bill ( HF3263 ) that would provide one-time funding of $50 million forstandards implementation. \"I certainly think the ongoing funding is necessary,\" she said. \"I'm only disappointed Ididn't combine my bill with this earlier.\" Carruthers agreed that ongoing funding is an integral piece of his plan. \"The theory is that the grad rule is a major change that will continue to evolve,\" he said.\"Students and teachers will continue to workto improve the standards.\" The division will consider the bills for in- clusion in an omnibus K-12 funding bill. Reducing class sizes Reducing class sizes in public schools is on the minds of many lawmakers this year. AHouse panel heard three separate proposalsFeb. 11 to provide funds to keep classes smaller. All three plans target second- and third- grade classrooms, and all would provide moneyto schools that keep those classes to 20 stu-dents or fewer. Current law provides fundingfor schools to reduce the size of their kinder-garten and first-grade classrooms to 17 stu-dents or fewer. Ian Keith, who teaches sixth grade at St. Paul Longfellow Magnet School, testified aboutthe burden of overcrowded classrooms beforethe K-12 Education Finance Division of theHouse Education Committee. He said that of the 28 children in his class, five are reading on a second-grade level. \"Three of them are learning disabled, and there they are all day, struggling with me,while at the other end I have three or four kidsreading at a high-school level,\" he said. \"It's anincredible challenge, no one is getting theattention they need, and then to those aca-demics you add the behavior piece.\" Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), who is sponsoring one of the class-size reduction bills(HF3017 ), said that current class sizes are \"making teaching an endurance race.\" Other lawmakers \u2014 including Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), a teacher whoonce had a classroom of 42 students \u2014 agreedthat reducing class size is an important part of improving the quality of education. But Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) cautioned that while \"our ideal goal would beto have 15 students in each class, I think wehave to set more realistic numbers. As much aswe want to do that, we also have a limitedamount of resources.\" In addition to Entenza's bill, the division discussed HF3233 , sponsored (DFL-Fridley). The division took no action on the bills, but will consider them later this session for inclu-sion in the omnibus K-12 finance bill. Schools, public transportation Although some parents say they don't want their children riding public buses to and fromschool, a bill that would allow the St. Paul andMinneapolis school districts to seek agree-ments to use public transportation was ap-proved by the House Education CommitteeFeb. 10. In fact, several thousand students from those districts already ride Metro Transit buses, es-pecially for after-school activities. But Rep.Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of HF2919 , said current law sets some barriers to districtsentering into certain kinds of agreements withtransit companies. \"This bill is a way of allowing for continued dialogue,\" he said. \"Any issue would still haveto be approved by the local school board andthe Metropolitan Council.\" Judy Miller, a parent living in St. Paul, tes- tified against the proposal, citing safety con-cerns that include longer ride times, bus stopslocated further from home, and the potentialdanger to children having to transfer busesdowntown. She also said the plan may hurt the city's program of voluntary desegregation becausemany parents will not want their children toride public buses to schools across town. Threeother St. Paul mothers also testified againstthe bill. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) agreed and urged lawmakers to take \"a stand that theHouse is in favor of safety on school buses.\" But Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) said the bill would not necessarily put money infront of safety \u2014 and that school districtsshould be trusted to look out for children'ssafety. \"When transportation continues to take a larger bite out of the education budget, theneducation suffers,\" she said. \"We have to be11 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYlooking at other models and discussing how we can do a better job for kids.\" In the end, lawmakers determined by vote that it would be appropriate to let the districtsdeal with the issues individually. \"I think the testimony was appropriate, but this was the wrong venue,\" Rep. CharlieWeaver (R-Anoka) said. \"That testimonyshould be made in front of the school boardwho will make the ultimate decision.\" The bill now moves to the House floor. Genevieve Hanson, a junior at Hinckley-Finlayson High School, takes a closer look at somestudent art work from around the state. The exhibit, in the north wing of the Capitol Feb. 9, wassponsored by the Minnesota Alliance for Arts in Education to promote awareness of artseducation.Student art ENVIRONMENTDriver education program Three high school students brought their proposal for a pilot driver education programto the K-12 Education Finance Division of theHouse Education Committee Feb. 9. \"We learned that there's a public concern about teenage driving, and we wanted to con-nect the increased dropout rate and studentsnot doing well in school with that,\" said DavidNieman, a senior at Minneapolis SouthwestHigh School and a member of the citywidestudent souncil. Nieman worked with seven other members of the council's subcommittee on driving todevelop a plan that they felt would provideaffordable quality driver education while en-couraging students to perform well in school. The result is in HF2483 , sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), which wouldprovide $2.5 million to establish three two-year pilot programs across the state. Students would be required to have passed 80 percent of classes taken the previous year tobe eligible for the program. State funds would pay 80 percent of driver education costs (about$210 per student) and students would pay theremaining 20 percent. \"If it was state funded, that means it could also be state regulated,\" Nieman said, suggest-ing the state could mandate extra training fornighttime driving or other areas where teenshistorically have problems. The proposal also calls for suspending the licenses of teens who drop out of school aftercompleting the program. David Sodenberg, of the Association for Pro- fessional Driving Instructors, said the bill wouldmake it difficult for private instructors to com-pete for students. He reminded the division thata 1997 law already provides tax credits to somefamilies for driver education expenses. And some lawmakers said they were con- cerned by what they see as the discriminatorynature of the bill. \"We have a lot of students who need jobs,\" Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) said.\"If we pass this law, we put them in a toughplace: Do they go to school and use this pro-gram, or do they continue to work for supple-mental income?\" Nieman said the student council had hoped the bill would encourage teens to do well inschool. He suggested the bill could be rewrit-ten to allow principals to exempt certain stu-dents from the qualifications. The bill is similar to current laws in Illinois and North Carolina. The division will con-sider the proposal for inclusion in this year'somnibus K-12 education finance bill.More funding for scholarships It's been 10 years since the state has in- creased funding for scholarships for Ameri-can Indians, but a bill discussed Feb. 9 in theK-12 Education Finance Division of the HouseEducation Committee would change that. HF2611 , sponsored by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), proposes $1.5 million inincreased funding over two years three sepa-rate programs: American Indian Scholarships,American Indian Post-Secondary PreparationGrants, and American Indian Language andCulture Programs. All three programs are aimed at increasing high school graduation rates and college at-tendance rates for members of Minnesota's 11federally recognized tribes. Kelso said the bill was one of several recom- mended by an interim task force headed byRep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) and concernedwith finding solutions for minority and at-risk students. \"We've increased scholarships for students of color recently, but did not increase those forAmerican Indians,\" Kelso said. Under the bill, each of the three programs would get funding increases of $250,000 peryear in 1998 and 1999. Of the three, American Indian Scholarships receives the most state money, with an appro-priation of $1.85 million per year. The need-based scholarships fill the unfulfilled needs instudents' financial aid packages, which mostlikely include federal grants, loans, parent con-tributions, and student contributions. Undergraduates are eligible for up to $3,000 per year from the state scholarship program,and their tribes are expected to match theamount received. That program has been around since 1955, a year when not one American Indian gradu-ated from high school in Minnesota. In its firstyear, scholarships helped five American In-dian students attend college, and today theprogram helps about 900 a year, according toJoseph Day, executive director of the state'sIndian Affairs Council. The division set aside the bill for possible inclusion in its omnibus K-12 funding billlater this session. Bonding for the environment While debate swirls over the future of Minnesota's rebounding timber wolf popula-tion, a House committee has approved a pro-posal to improve a popular destinationdesigned to introduce humans to the species.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998 Nancy Gibson, co-founder of the International Wolf Center in Ely, Minn., presents a bonding requestfor improvements at the center during a hearingat the House Environment, Natural Resources andAgriculture Finance Committee Feb. 9.GAMBLING Under a $270 million bonding proposal approved by the House Environment, NaturalResources and Agriculture Finance Commit-tee Feb. 12, the International Wolf Center inEly, Minn., would receive $336,000 in statebond proceeds for a variety of improvements. \"Our role and mission is public education about wolves,\" said Nancy Gibson, co-founderof the center, during Feb. 10 testimony beforethe committee. Home to four wolves \u2014 MacKenzie, Lucas, Lakota, and Kiana \u2014 the nonprofit center issupported mainly by membership contribu-tions, endowments, and merchandise salesfrom its mail order catalog. Mary Ortiz, the center's executive director, said the organization has more than 8,500members from all 50 states and 38 nations. The center estimates that over 250,000 visi- tors have passed through its doors since itopened in 1993. A similar number is estimatedto have visited the U.S. Forest Service's Bound-ary Waters permit station within the wolfcenter's building. Gibson said that with all of the traffic through the facility, improvements to the drivewayand the heating and ventilation system arehigh priorities. The center also intends to add exterior light- ing for evening programs, build a garage, re-place the lecture hall seating, repair the wolfenclosure, and create an interactive children's exhibit. Noticeably absent from the bonding bill is funding for the governor's proposed $14 mil-lion Veterans Memorial State Park in Duluth,Minn. Here's a look at some of the provisions in the bonding proposal: The Department of Natural Resources would receive nearly $207 million for a myriad ofprojects, including $28.8 million for grantsto local governments to prevent or controlflood damages, $24.6 million to improvetrails in the Metropolitan area park systemand connect them with existing state andregional trails, $20.0 million to establish andmaintain metropolitan-area greenways andnatural areas, and $8.3 million for safe har-bors on Lake Superior. The Board of Soil and Water Resources would receive $27.1 million. Of that figure, $16.8million would target wetlands for protec-tion under the Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM)program. Under RIM, landowners are paidto retire certain lands from agricultural pro-duction or place wetlands into conserva-tion. The city of St. Paul would receive $14.0 million to develop the Como Park Educa-tion Resource Center at the Como Zoo. Thecenter would focus on fostering children'sappreciation of animals and the environ-ment. The Minnesota Zoological Gardens would receive $3.2 million for roadway and park-ing lot improvements. The Apple Valley zooalso has requested $1.5 million in supple-mental funding for 1998 to make up for aserious shortfall in gate receipts lastsummer. The bonding proposal now moves to the House Capital Investment Committee. Living snow fences Minnesota lawmakers spent $20 million last year to help cities and counties recoup some oftheir weather-related costs from record-break-ing snowfalls during the previous winter. Of that money, a total of $11 million was distributed to local governments for snowremoval expenses. A bill that aims to reduce the need for such spending in the future was approved Feb. 9 bythe House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee. HF1561 , sponsored by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus), would fund a voluntary programfor landowners to plant and maintain trees,shrubs, and grass strips alongside roads in aneffort to control drifting and blowing snow.\"I think last winter was a good testament as to why we need this bill,\" Finseth said. The bill would provide $500,000 for grants to soil and water conservation districts to en-ter into cost-sharing contracts with landown-ers. The contracts could provide for annualpayments to the landowners to cover land andmaintenance costs. North Dakota has a similar new program, Finseth said, and the initial results arepromising. \"Franklin Roosevelt promoted living snow fences during the Dust Bowl days,\" Rep.Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) said. \"Theywere very effective.\" The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Fi-nance Committee. State lottery advertising The Minnesota State Lottery needs a bigger advertising budget and would benefit frompromotions tied to holidays, according toGeorge Anderson, director of the MinnesotaState Lottery. Anderson testified in support of HF3104 before the House Regulated Industries Com-mittee, which approved the bill Feb. 10. Theproposal now moves to the House Govern-mental Operations Committee. The bill, sponsored by Mike Delmont (DFL- Lexington), would allow the state lottery tohave holiday themes in its advertising andgame strategies. State law currently prohibitslottery advertising from \"exploiting\" a reli-gious holiday. Legislators said they did not want to see religious symbols used by the state lottery, butamended the wording of the bill to allow de-piction of figures such as Santa Claus or aChristmas tree. Anderson estimated the stateloses $5 million to $10 million dollars per yearunder that prohibition. That estimate is on his knowledge of holi- day-themed promotions in the gambling in-dustry, \"which are very popular,\" Andersonsaid. The bill would also increase from 2.75 per- cent to 4 percent the maximum amount ofannual gross revenues that the lottery canspend on advertising. Anderson said the changewouldn't necessarily mean more advertising,but would help maintain an adequate level ofadvertising. Anderson said advertising rates on Twin Cities television stations have risen 64 percentin the past five years, and Twin Cities' radioadvertising rates have risen 20 percent. In13 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYDuluth, radio advertising rates are up more than 30 percent in the past five years, he said. \"This would add about three or four million dollars to our advertising budget,\" Andersonsaid. He said retail signage, which involves wir- ing for lights in the signs, has also aged andneeds to be replaced. In Minnesota, state lot-tery retailers receive signage free of charge, sosome of the new advertising dollars would beused for new signs. The bill also would allow the state lottery to pay a bonus of not more than 10 percent tolottery retailers if lottery sales rise over theprevious year. The bonus would be distrib-uted among retailers in proportion to theirsales. More time for ice fishing Resort owners and anglers who have been disappointed by an unusually mild winter mayget a lift from a bill heading for the governor'sdesk. The bill, which would extend the 1998 ice fishing season until March 1, passed the HouseFeb. 11 on a 125-0 vote. The season is normally closed the third Sunday in February. The additional two-weekwindow this year would give resorts an oppor-tunity to capture some lost revenue and an-glers a chance to make up for lost time. The Department of Natural Resources sup- ports the extension; however, the departmentwould have the authority to close the season inthe event of an early thaw. Another provision in the bill would extend the deadline for ice fishing houses to be re-moved from lakes. State law mandates that the ice fishing houses be removed from lakes by the end of February.The bill stipulates that if the last day of Febru-ary falls on a Saturday, the deadline should beextended by one day. That's the case this year, so the deadline to get ice fishing houses off lakes would be March 1. The bill ( HF2492/SF2111* ) is sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls). The Sen-ate approved the proposal Feb. 12 on a 47-0vote. Moose odds increase Ten-time losers in the Minnesota moose hunting license lottery might get lucky thisyear under a bill ( HF3275 ) the House Envi- ronment and 9.Sponsored by Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL- Chisholm), the bill calls for 5 percent of themoose licenses issued each year to come froma pool of applicants who have applied at least10 times to no avail. Roger Holmes, director of the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Department of Natu-ral Resources, said there were 198 permitsissued out of 16,899 applications last year. Holmes said the moose harvest was 152, which means those fortunate few who win thelicense lottery have good odds for success. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources and AgricultureFinance Committee. GAME & FISHGOVERNMENT Unicameral legislature bill Supporters of the switch to a unicameral legislature in Minnesota had their chanceFeb. 9 in the House General Legislation,Veterans Affairs and Elections Committee,but they were unsuccessful. A bill ( HF581 ) sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) that would haveplaced the constitutional question on the bal-lot in November was defeated on an 11-5 votein the committee. However, there are several other unicam- eral proposals that the committee did not acton, and those measures could be consideredlater this session. Hausman's bill would create a unicameral (one-house) legislature called the senate with135 members, each of whom would serve four-year terms. If voters were to approve the constitutional amendment, the new model of legislaturewould begin in January 2003. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) said she likes the idea. \"With a bicameral legislature, too much power is concentrated in the hands of theconferees. With a unicameral legislature, wewouldn't have a conference committee, there-fore, everything could always be amended,\"she said. When similar bills are approved in the House and Senate, conference committees conveneto reconcile any differences. Once agreementis reached in the conference committee, a billis sent back to each body for final approval,and that bill cannot be amended. Lawmakersmust accept or reject the conference commit-tee report as is. During the meeting, Sen. Dave Kleis (R-St. Cloud) told committee members that he vis-ited Nebraska, the only state that has a uni-cameral legislature, and liked what he saw. \"They've never had a serious effort to go back to a bicameral legislature,\" he said. Nebraska's constitution was amended in 1934, and the first unicameral legislature thereconvened in 1937. Nebraska's Legislature isnonpartisan and has 49 senators. The movewas made during the Depression to savemoney. \"Ninety-nine percent of city councils are unicameral,\" Kleis said, and some cities arebigger than some states. Canada has a unicam-eral legislature, as do the governing boards ofmost businesses. \"They don't have two boards of directors,\" Kleis said. But Kleis had a hard time selling some mem- bers of the committee, including Rep. Ann H.Rest (DFL-New Hope). \"Comparing city councils with legislative bodies in my mind is a silly comparison andone you best not make,\" she said. Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) said conference committees are not as undesirableas critics have said. \"The conference committees are open to the public, they resolve the difference in twobills, then it goes back to both chambers. Iwould think you would open yourself up toless public input [with a unicameral legisla-ture],\" he said. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) also had concerns about the one-houselegislature. \"Speeding up the process at a time when people have less access to government becauseof events in their lives holds some concerns forme. This might work well in Nebraska, but Ijust have a great deal of difficulty [with it]. It'sapples to oranges,\" she said. Kleis said the goal of the unicameral system is greater efficiency, not greater speed. \"When it works in Nebraska, it's a very deliberative process. If you do it once, it's avery deliberate process,\" he said. \"You havebetter responsiveness to the people that sendyou here in a unicameral legislature.\" Asked what might be different in a Minne- with a unicameral legislature, government.\" Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul), chair of the committee, said a \"fatal flaw\" inthe bill is the proposed four-year terms, whichhe considers too long. \"If you want to get rid of accountability in government, I can't think of a better way to dothat,\" he said.14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998HUMAN SERVICESINDUSTRYFunding request defended With charts and graphs in hand, represen- tatives of the Office of the Attorney Generalappeared before a House committee Feb. 9 todefend their 1999 funding request. Gov. Arne Carlson used his line-item veto authority to strike the office's entire 1999 bud-get of $24.4 million last year, imprudent, department. \"The unprecedented,\" Lee Sheehy, chief deputy attorney general,told the State Government Finance Divisionof the House Governmental Operations Com-mittee. Carlson reinstated $22.5 million for the of- fice in his supplemental budget proposal thisyear, but Sheehy and Deputy Attorney Gen-eral Margaret Chutich said they need about $3million more to operate effectively in 1999. Chutich, who heads the office's law en- forcement division, said the office has had toturn down counties' requests for help on tasksincluding homicide prosecutions, drug inves-tigations, and white-collar crime investiga-tions. \"If the rate of referral in homicide cases and the rate of growth in criminal cases continueswithout more funding, there will be moredeclinations,\" she said. The pair also defended their office against Carlson's charges of spendthrift practices. \"Our services are a bargain,\" Sheehy said. \"Our rates are lower than in sector . . . [and] our attorneys are noteven at 85 percent of the compensation levelsof other public service attorneys.\" Sheehy also noted that through the office's efforts, millions of dollars are reclaimed forthe state, including, for fiscal years 1996 and1997: $23 million to the state treasury, $27million to Minnesota consumers, and morethan $200 million in defeated claims againstthe state. The office's 1999 proposed budget is di- vided into three categories: $13.6 million forlaw enforcement, $2.2 million for agency rep-resentation, and $8.7 million for defense andprosecution of civil claims. The division will consider the request for inclusion in its omnibus state governmentfinance bill. Youth empowerment Saying he doesn't often make such prom- ises, Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) as-sured two young people Feb. 11 that hiscommittee would approve their funding re-quest or he would \"personally hold everythingelse up.\"Becky Jarvis, 16, and Tangene Hayslett, 20, appeared before the State Government Fi-nance Division of the House GovernmentalOperations Committee to support the Min-nesota Alliance with Youth. The youth-empowerment movement grew out of the Presidents' Summit for America, anApril 1997 national gathering in Philadelphiato promote community volunteerism. \"We have youth and adults at the table together and a lot of our goals turn out to besimilar,\" Jarvis said. \"Youth needs to be em-powered to talk about problems and to takeresponsibility for them.\" Both Jarvis and Hayslett spoke about their own experiences dealing with disenfranchisedyouth. \"Just having someone who you know is interested, someone who says 'good job' makesthe difference,\" Hayslett said. Donna Gillen, the alliance's director, said the organization works throughout the statedeveloping resources, such as relationshipswith mentors, aimed at helping \"young peopleto fulfill their promise.\" She said the organization relies heavily on existing institutions \u2014 schools, churches,businesses \u2014 to build partnerships betweenyouth and the rest of the community. The alliance is asking the state for $1.5 million. The bulk of the group's budget comesfrom private sector donors including DaytonHudson, General Mills Inc., Lutheran Broth-erhood, and Pillsbury. The group has also received $49 million from various state agencies. The division will consider the request for inclusion in its omnibus state governmentfinance bill. Child protective services Minnesota is one of 10 states in which child protective services are provided by countyrather than state employees. A study by thelegislative auditor reveals child protection in-vestigations vary widely among counties, partlybecause counties do not uniformly interpretmaltreatment definitions in Minnesota law. A bill sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL- St. Paul) proposes to appropriate money forpilot projects that would create more unifor-mity statewide. The bill ( HF2985 ) also would focus on prevention for abused and neglectedchildren. The House Health and Human Services Committee approved the policy part of the billFeb. 12. The appropriations part of the bill wassent to the committee's finance division. Gov. Arne Carlson has called for $10 mil- lion for child welfare services in his currentbudget. Entenza's bill requests $30 million.Some of that would go to three metropolitanand three rural counties for a pilot projectaimed at improved child protection oversight. The bill would provide $3,500 for each of 2,100 assessments in the pilot project duringeach of the next four years. Entenza said thatfigure would include the salary of the caseworker, services provided, counseling, paren-tal support, and other related services. Entenza said the cost of removing a child from a home runs from $11,000 to $34,000. In1996, $164 million was spent on out-homeplacements in Minnesota. Only $31 millionwas spent on prevention through family pres-ervation services. Telephone companies pay The dynamics of telecommunications have brought numerous players into the industry,but when the Public Utilities Commission(PUC) allocates costs incurred during its in-vestigations, telephone companies pay thecharge. That would change under a bill ( HF3123 ), sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Har-ris). The bill would charge the costs incurredby the PUC to all parties involved in a pro-ceeding that comes before the commission. The House Regulated Industries and En- ergy Committee approved the bill Feb. 5. The bill was prompted, in part, by a case that involved the reselling of a service pro-vided by a utility. Jerry Knickerbocker, of the Minnesota Tele- phone Association, told of a case in which alocal phone company claimed that a serviceuser was improperly reselling the service pro-vided by the phone company. The phone com-pany argued this before the PUC and wasfound to be correct. \"And lo and behold the telephone company gets the bill for the cost of this proceeding,\"Knickerbocker said. \"The company pays forbeing proven right. The commission has noability at the present time to assess anyoneother than telephone companies.\" Knickerbocker said the changing nature of the industry is likely to mean similar cases willmultiply, not diminish. He said the effect ofthe current arrangement means telephonecustomers ultimately and unfairly foot theentire bill. The committee made a change to the bill15 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY after hearing from citizens concerned that the proposal would deter individuals from bring-ing a case before the PUC. Alvin Huff, who represented the American Association of Retired Persons, told the com-mittee that telecommunications issues are toocomplex already, and \"the end result of thisbill will have a chilling effect on dialogue\"between citizens and the PUC. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) asked, \"Why would an individual come before thePUC if the individual has to pay part of thecost?\" The bill was amended to exclude citizens and certain \"end-users\" of telephone servicesfrom footing a portion of the bill for PUCactions. The altered bill now moves to theHouse floor. Minnesota Zoo volunteer Maryce Carl shows off a giant African millipede to 3-year-old JeffreyWieters, of Big Lake, Minn., as his sister Joy, 5, looks on. Minnesota Zoo staff were at the Capitolrotunda Feb. 10 for a rally to highlight the zoo's mission and goals.Creepy crawler LAW METRO AFFAIRSOmnibus family law bill The omnibus family law bill ( HF2784 ) was approved by the Civil and Family Law Divi-sion of the House Judiciary CommitteeFeb. 11. The most ambitious portion of the bill is a somewhat altered version of the parentingplan proposal backed by Rep. Andy Dawkins(DFL-St. Paul). The parenting plan proposal (originally in- troduced as HF1323 ) would restructure state law to focus on joint decision-making be-tween the two divorced parents. Under current law, the courts establish cus- tody in situations where the placement of thechild is an issue after marriage dissolution.Courts designate a custodial parent, and alldecisions concerning the child are made bythat parent. Under the new language, parents involved in marriage dissolution proceedings would beprovided the option to compose a plan thatwould ensure significant participation by bothparents in all decision-making. The docu-ment would outline visitation and custodyissues for the child. Courts would then ap-prove the parenting plan. Initially, the bill required that this option be instituted by the courts statewide. The latestversion of the bill creates a pilot project andgives each judicial district the power to decidewhether or not to participate in the pilot. The omnibus family law bill, sponsored by Dawkins, now goes to the full JudiciaryCommittee.Met Council members elected? Under a proposal headed for the House floor, members of the Metropolitan Councilwould be elected and some would serve onboth the council and the board of commis-sioners in their home county. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) is spon- soring a bill ( HF2588 ) that would change the way members of the Metropolitan Council areselected. \"A significant government entity with this kind of taxing power should be elected,\"Orfield said, during Feb. 11 testimony beforethe House Local Government and Metropoli-tan Affairs Committee. Orfield has introduced several bills calling for an elected Metropolitan Council in recentyears, including one last year that passed theLegislature but was vetoed by Gov. ArneCarlson. The Metropolitan Council was created in 1967 and is responsible for regional planningin the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. It's oneof the largest regional governments in thecountry and oversees the regional bus system,wastewater treatment facilities, and MetroMobility, a transit operation that serves dis-abled people. Its annual budget is $360 million, partially paid by property taxes. It has approximately3,500 employees. The council is governed by aboard of directors appointed by the governor. There are 16 members, each representing adifferent portion of the region, and a chair. Orfield's latest bill drew much debate dur- ing committee hearings on the matter. Under the proposal, the Legislature would redistrict the metropolitan area after the 2000census into equal-sized council districts. When a council district is wholly within a county, the district would be the same as thecounty commission district. Thus, the personelected in that district would serve on bothpanels. For Metropolitan Council districts not within a single county, only candidates for acounty board could file (separately) for elec-tion to the Metropolitan Council. If elected toboth offices, they would serve in both offices. So it would have the effect of making county commissioners in each county members ofthe Metropolitan Council. \"I think the main thing the bill addresses is the aspect of accountability,\" said Rep. PegLarsen (R-Lakeland), a co-sponsor of the bill. Ramsey County Commissioner Victoria Reinhardt testified in support of the bill. \"We feel there is a disconnection between the constituency and the Metropolitan Coun-cil members,\" she said. But Rep. Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) had some concerns about the proposal. \"One of the pluses of having the governor appoint [the Metropolitan Council] is thatthere is some turnover from time to time,\" hesaid. \"What happens if they're elected forever16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998MILITARY TAXESTRANSPORTATIONand ever? Do you worry that someone will get on and then be on it forever and a day?\" Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) said she does not like the idea of county commission-ers serving on the council. \"A lot of the decision-making is dependent on the council serving as a regional group. Ithink there would really, truly be a conflict,\"she said. \"I have some real problems withthose people maintaining their neutrality tothe people that elected them.\" The bill was approved Feb. 11 by the metro- politan affairs committee and Feb. 12 by theHouse General Legislation, Veterans Affairsand Elections Committee. NATO expansion resolution A bill calling for a resolution to ask Presi- dent Clinton and Congress to support theadmission of Poland, the Czech Republic, andthe Republic of Hungary to NATO passed theHouse Feb. 9. A NATO expansion to include those three countries is anticipated in April 1999, pendingU.S. Senate approval. That body is expected tovote on ratifying the necessary treaty withinthe next two months. HF2417 , sponsored by Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth), passed on a vote of 117-2. Jaros spent about two months translating for NATO troops in northeastern Bosnia lastsummer. \"My idea is that every country should join NATO, and then once everybody is joined insupport of peace, we won't need any morearmies,\" he said. Dependent care tax credit A measure that expands the eligibility for the dependent care tax credit \u2014 particularlyfor parents with children in day care \u2014 wasapproved Feb. 12 by the House TaxesCommittee. The bill ( HF2804 ) is sponsored by Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood). The state currently allows a child care tax credit equal to a percentage of child care costs,up to a maximum of $720 for one child or$1,140 for two or more children. That creditbegins to decrease for parents making $17,340per year and is completely phased out forparents making $31,080. Slawik's bill would decrease the rate in which the credit is phased out and increase the in-come at which the credit would be completely phased out to $45,080 a year. \"What the tax credit really is about is chil- dren, and young children,\" Slawik told thecommittee. She said with seven of 10 mothers in the workforce and five of six mothers with chil-dren under six working, there is a need for thathelp. The cost for having two children in childcare can be $9,500 per year, she said. Claudia Grant, owner-administrator of Capitol Child Care, said the bill is importantfor young families. \"Early entry career people really struggle to pay for child care. It's a good attempt at help-ing their families be self-sufficient,\" she said. The bill is set to be included in this year's omnibus tax bill. New transportation fund? Minnesota has averaged one proposed con- stitutional amendment a year since 1980, anda bill that would create a new state transporta-tion fund would maintain that pace. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Newport), proposes that voters decidewhether there should be a constitutionalamendment to establish a new transportationfund for highways and public transit. The fund would receive all revenues from state motor vehicle license taxes (about $485million) and 20 percent of the revenue fromthe motor vehicle sales tax (about $80 mil-lion), and the money would be reserved forhighway and transit purposes. The bill ( HF3265 ) was approved by the House Transportation and Transit Commit-tee Feb. 9 and sent to its finance division,which has yet to take action on the bill. The bill also requires that funding for State Highway Patrol enforcement on state trunkhighways, other than commercial vehicle en-forcement, come from the general fund, ratherthan the trunk highway fund. The bill alsowould forbid the use of highway dollars toconstruct buildings. The new transportation fund \u2014 which would be dubbed the intermodal surface trans-portation trust fund \u2014 would provide rev-enue for highway, bridge, and transit projects.The intent is to create a fund that can be usedto match federal transportation funds, includ-ing dollars for options such as light rail transit. \"We don't have the dollars to match every one of these funds,\" Marko said, \"and we needsome flexibility for optional transportationmethods.\"Specifically, she would like to see Minne- sota in a better position to secure funds avail-able under the Intermodal SurfaceTransportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). In 1991, ISTEA was considered revolution- ary federal transportation policy. Federal allo-cations were to be tied to state funds with anemphasis on preserving, or making more effi-cient use of, current transportation systems.ISTEA was also to encourage innovative trans-portation solutions. ISTEA also allowed funding to be \"flexed\" from one program to another. Giving stateand local decision-makers funding flexibilityenabled inter-city rail to continue or expandoperations, for instance. Part of the intent of HF3265 is to provide the state with funding to solve its transit,traffic, and parking problems in the TwinCities area. In that region, construction fornew highway projects is estimated to exceed$55 million a mile. And while roughly 250miles of new highway was laid in the TwinCities area in the past 20 years, only 20 miles ofadditional highway is planned in the nextdecade. Rural areas of Minnesota, where the cost of highway construction is considerably lower,also would be eligible for matching federalfunds under HF3265 . Marko's bill calls for the proposed amend- ment to the state constitution to be placed onthe November 1998 ballot. Since 1980 there have been 18 proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot, ofwhich 13 were adopted. Amendments to theconstitution may be proposed by a majorityvote of both the state House and Senate. Amajority vote of the total number of personsvoting in the next state general election isrequired to ratify proposed amendments. Graduated licensing for teens In an attempt to diminish the number of accidents involving younger drivers, 26 stateshave enacted graduated licensing for teenagedrivers. The concept requires younger driversto meet minimum requirements en route toattaining full driving status. Minnesota would join those states under a bill ( HF2532 ) sponsored by Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley). No Minnesota teenbelow the age of 17 would be eligible for a fulldriver's license under the bill. Currently, Min-nesota teens can earn full driving privileges atage 16. The House Transportation and Transit Committee approved the bill Feb. 11; it nowmoves to the committee's finance division. Under the bill, drivers in Minnesota would17 February 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY have to be 16 years old and possess a learner's permit for at least six months to be eligible fora provisional license. The applicant wouldhave to be free of traffic violations or convic-tions in the six months before application.Applicants also would have to complete anapproved driver education course. The provisional license would allow unsu- pervised driving between 5 a.m. and mid-night. Exceptions would be made for tripsrelated to employment, education, or reli-gion. Drivers under 18 applying for an adultlicense would need to hold the provisionaldriver's license for at least a year and incur nodriving convictions or violations. During the 1997 session, bills for teen gradu- ated licensing were introduced in both theHouse and Senate. The House bill stalled inthe Transportation Committee. Its compan-ion bill in the Senate reached the floor butnever came up for a vote. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 35 percent of deaths in the 15 to 19age group result from motor vehicle crashes.In 1996, 6,319 traffic deaths occurred in the 16to 20 age group. In a graduated licensing system, full driving privileges are phased in, with the teen graduallyaccumulating driving experience. The first suchmodel was developed 20 years ago by the Na-tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The bill also would create youth-oriented driver improvement clinics for young andnovice drivers with a history of improper driv-ing practices. The clinics would require up tonine hours of training at a cost of no morethan $50. Errol Fernandez-Edwards, right, coordinator and design team member of West Side Riverfront Planning and Development, speaks about the cooperation his group has had with the city of St.Paul on plans to redevelop Harriet Island. Tim Agness, left, of the St. Paul Parks Division also testified Feb. 6 before the House Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee.Harriet Island plan Light rail transit The prospect of a light rail transit (LRT) system in the Twin Cities moved closer toreality Feb. 9 when the House TransportationCommittee approved a bonding proposal thatwould provide $106 million toward LRT de-velopment. The LRT funds would provide $99 million to build a transportation line from downtownMinneapolis to the Minneapolis-St. Paul In-ternational Airport and Mall of America. Theline is being called the Hiawatha Avenue Cor-ridor. The state's $99 million would be matched with $200 million in federal transit capitalfunds. The remaining $7 million for LRT in the bonding proposal would be used to studyexpansion of the LRT into St. Paul and othercorridors and to study commuter rail devel-opment. LRT typically serves urban-suburban mar-kets with short distances between stations. Commuter rail primarily serves the urbanmarket, and is characterized by station-to-station distances of about 2.5 miles. It usesexisting rail lines. The bill calls for $24 million to be available in fiscal year 1999 for the Hiawatha Corridorproject and $25 million for the project in eachof the subsequent three fiscal years. An earlier Hiawatha Corridor plan called for $100 million for the project and $6 millionin studies for future expansion. However, anadditional $1 million was shifted to fund com- muter rail studies for the Young America railline from Carver County to Minneapolis andthe Bethel rail line linking Cambridge with theNorthstar Corridor of the LRT system in AnokaCounty. The bonding proposal also calls for $34 million for local bridge replacement and reha-bilitation. The bill ( HF2373 ), sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), now moves to theHouse Capital Investment Committee. Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters) had a point to make while the House Environment,Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee finalized its bonding recommen-dations Feb. 12. During a flurry of last-minute amendments and requests for even more money, he spoke up.A bill that would license naturopathic phy- sicians ( HF396 ) was removed from the House Health and Human Services Committeeagenda Feb. 12 after it became apparent itwould not be heard in the Senate this session. Sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL- Mpls), the bill is the fourth of its kind since1986. Before Wejcman pulled the bill from con- sideration, she said, \"I don't normally supporta unicameral legislature, but I'd favor it thismorning if it means we could get rid of theSenate.\"Rep. Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) indicated she was having a difficult time hear-ing testimony from Ralph McQuarter, of theDepartment of Human Services, during ameeting of the finance division of the HouseHealth and Human Services Committee. \"I'm a soft-spoken person,\" McQuarter said, which prompted to say: \"We'll have tochange that. It doesn't work well around theLegislature.\"\"I've been voting 'no' on all of these amend- ments, and I don't want any of the members totake it personally,\" Kalis said. \"I'm just prac-ticing.\" Kalis chairs the House Capital Investment Committee, through which all requests forbonding dollars must pass before going to theHouse floor.18 SESSION WEEKLY / February 13, 1998By Grant Martin Recently elected Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake) likes to put his money wherehis mouth is. \"I firmly believe we have a strong and good form of government,\" hesaid. \"But it's also verydelicate, and it dependson one thing and that'scitizens being involved atsome level or another tomake it work.\" And he has been in- volved. Vandeveer served on the Mounds View Charter Commission. He is a member of the ForestLake Planning Commission and a formermember of the government affairs committeeof the Suburban Area Chamber of Commerce.He also has served as a volunteer probationofficer in Anoka County. He said that his experience in local govern- ment will help him better serve the people ofhis legislative district, especially because he isfamiliar with the current local issues. \"It gives me an idea of what the local prob- lems are in the district I represent,\" Vandeveersaid. \"There are some issues with the pro-posed merger of Forest Lake and Forest LakeTownship that really shine the light on localproblems.\" Vandeveer lives in Forest Lake with his wife, Camille, and their four children, Paul, Phillip,Cara, and Alana. He owns a real estate ap-praisal firm that has been in business since1981. He made his first attempt at elected office inNew member . . . Ray Vandeveer to focus on taxes, education, crime 1996 when he challenged incumbent state Sen.Jane Krentz (DFL-May Township) and lost.But Vandeveer said he was very proud of howthe vote turned out, considering the fact thathe was running against an incumbent. \"I was pretty convinced that the voters liked and approved of my message to do that well,\"he said. Vandeveer said his numbers were particu- larly good in the half of that Senate district thatcomprises his current House district. So when Rep. Doug Swenson (R-Forest Lake) resigned to take a new job as a judge inthe 10th Judicial District Court, Vandeveerfelt that he was the right person for the job. \"I did not expect that to happen when it did and it was clearly an opportunity coming outof the Senate race and doing well on our sideof the district against an incumbent,\" he said.\"I thought it was a good fit.\" Vandeveer said that he plans to focus on taxes, crime, and education as a member ofthe House. He said that taxes are too high inMinnesota, and he will focus on providing taxrelief for families. \"My priorities will be lower taxes and re- duced state spending. I want to work very hardto see that we reduce that level of taxation forhard-working families,\" he said. Vandeveer said that the state also has to protect its population against violent crime. \"We want a clear signal that this is the wrong place, the wrong state to come andcommit violent crime,\" he said. When it comes to violent crime, the state must be concerned with safety first \u2014 morethan rehabilitation \u2014 but the state should alsowork on developing prevention programs tokeep youth out of crime, Vandeveer said. \"I served as a volunteer probation officer a number of years ago in Anoka County, and Ido think that those kinds of programs thatwork with youth are the probably the mostlikely to be successful.\" he said. \"Getting tokids, I think this is where we have the bestchance of success.\" Vandeveer says that he wants to ensure the quality of education in his district. \"I think equitable funding for education is a big issue in a lot of suburban districts, andours is no exception. That is important tome,\" he said. Vandeveer won the special election on Jan. 27 and he was sworn in to office on Feb. 5. Hesaid that after a week on the job, he has beenimpressed by the speed at which things movein the Legislature and with the commitmentof the members. \"There are people I have met on both sides, from both parties who are passionate abouttheir views and representing their constitu-ents,\" he said. \"It really confirms my apprecia-tion for our system of government.\" suburban metro Top concern: \"Reducing the level of taxation. I think clearly in Minnesota we're overtaxed. I wantto work very hard to see that we reduce that levelof taxation for hard-working families. That's veryimportant to me.\" \u2014Rep.

There were con-stant rumors of unpatriotic ac- tivity circulatingin Minnesota during World War I, and the state took seri-ously the talk about one resident of the southeastern Minnesota village of Wykoff. The Minnesota commission in charge of \"public safety\" dur- ing that period dispensed one ofits half-dozen Pinkerton agents to uncover an alleged campaign led by one man to block draftregistration. Soon the operative reported that the alleged dissident, a hotelproprietor, \"was inclined to en- large on matters a great deal, as he uses liquor to excess.\" Theagent found no draft resistance, and questioned whether the trip was worth the expense. That episode aside, wasting state money was not the major criticism of the Minnesota Com-mission of Public Safety. Of the $1 million the 1917 Legislature appropriated for the commis-sion, most was spent on military men and their families. The problem with the commission was it had carte blancheto harass and intimi- date Minnesota citi- zens and electedofficials. Its 20- month reign was eventually catego-rized as a \"blatant Minnesota example of legalized discrimination.\" The Legislature was in session when World War I was declared. Shortly before adjournment in1917, lawmakers created the safety commission. The seven-member commis- sion had sweeping powers and fell under the dominating influ- ence of Judge John F. McGee, aconservative, anti-labor mem- ber. The commission, which firstPublic safety commission brandished sweeping powers met April 2, 1917, was allowedto lease or seize property if \"nec- essary or proper\" for public safety or protection of life. Thecommission could call citizens to give testimony under oath. It controlled the sale of liquor. Itquestioned public officials. It re- moved public officials from of- fice. German-Americans were the state's largest ethnic group at the time, but anti-German senti-ment still ran strong during the war, especially among commis- sion members, who used theirpower to topple the mayor and city attorney of New Ulm, Minn., a town with strong Germanroots. The commission's more griev- ous affronts include its battleagainst the national administration's labor policy, and its interference in the 1918elections, which brought the re- election of commission-backed Gov. J.A.A. Burnquist. The commission, which had its last formal meeting in De- cember 1918, is credited with having some posi- tive impact. It pro- moted foodproduction and conservation, and eradicated the bar-berry bush, the nemesis of wheat. It was responsible forfarm labor and crop censuses and the re- cruitment of laborfor farms and facto- ries. And the bulk of the money appropriated for the commis- sion went for the welfare of mili- tary men and their families. Ofthe $767,000 spent by the com- mission, roughly $488,000 went to \"soldiers' pay and suste-nance.\" Much of the remainder financed the commission's less honorable pursuits. Judge John F.

If you like art, it's a spectacular museum of some of the finest portrait paintings in the country. If you are an architecturebuff or bricks and mortar aficionado, you can spend hours discovering the different typesof marble, granite, and other stone used to erect architect Cass Gilbert's \"great wonder\"in the first five years of the 20th century. Metallurgy, woodworking, historic preservation, agriculture, military history, design, artists' perspective, artistic license, ancient and modern history, meditation sights, placesfor soapbox oratory \u2014 all are integral parts of what can be found in the building. Evensociologists can find what life was like in the early 1900s through research and whatdiverse ethnic and economic groups left behind here \"on the hill.\" All of the above interests and more are a permanent part of the hallways and byways of the most successfully planned statehouse in the country. Gilbert and the building's chief decorator, Elmer E. Garnsey, who also designed the U.S. Library of Congress, were very thorough in their quest to create a unique and soundedifice that would be a lasting tribute for generations to come. For those so inclined to ponder, or who may want to do so while visiting the Capitol, a thought-oriented voyage of the \"grand\" second floor awaits. Take a seat on one ofGilbert's original oak benches on the east or west wing. Look upward and discover some20 feet above, gold-inlaid inscriptions of well-known and little-known quotes by pastleaders of government, law, and justice. These ideas and thoughts of what government should do or how it should be for people command a nearly hidden presence below the vaulted ceilings of this noblebuilding. One inscription by educator, diplomat, and U.S. Secretary of State Edward Everett is worth remembering: \"Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army.\"Daniel Webster, noted American legislator and orator is quoted often. One of hismessages found on the walls above eye level states, \"No government is respectable whichis not just.\" Another memorable civic idea by national lawyer and public official, Elihu Root is engraved for posterity: \"Eternal good citizenship is the price of good government.\" One final quote for legislators, staff, and visitors to ponder is by William E. Gladstone, British politician and four-time prime minister: \"The proper function of a governmentis to make it easy for people to do good and difficult for them to do evil.\" The Capitol building has something for everyone. All one needs to do is take the time to find it. \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY From 0.10 to 0.08 . . . Lawmakers debate legal blood-alcohol limit for drivers gender. A standard drink would be a 12-ounce glass of beer, a five- ounce glass of wine, or a one-and-a-half-ounce shot of hard alcohol. Proponents of the 0.08 percent legislation argue that 0.10 percent standards were based on compromise and not on informed scientificstudies. \"When the 0.10 standard was established, it didn't reflect the knowl- edge that scientists now have,\" Entenza said. \"That is that drivers at0.08 are impaired.\" The first law that established a level for which drivers were presumed impaired in Minnesota was passed in 1955. It established a level of 0.15percent blood alcohol concentration. In 1967, the level was changed to 0.10 percent, based on new evidence of the effect of alcohol on driving skills. Very few studies atthis time examined the effect of alcohol levels lower than 0.10 percent. Earlier versions of the law were presumptive, meaning the courtswere to assume the personcharged was intoxicated at thatstandard unless evidence was of-fered otherwise. \"Per se\" laws \u2014 such as the current Minnesota law \u2014 meanthat regardless of behavior or vis-ible impairment, a person is le-gally considered intoxicated at thestandard. The person is consid-ered drunk regardless of any evi-dence to the contrary that may beoffered. Minnesota's law waschanged from presumptive to perse in 1971. Supporters of 0.08 percent say the new scientific informationshows that the limit should belowered. Studies done by the NHTSA show that most drivers, even ex-perienced drivers, are significantlyimpaired at the 0.08 percent level.They also show that the risk ofbeing killed in a single-vehiclecrash for drivers at concentrationlevels between 0.05 percent and0.09 percent is 11 times higherthan drivers with no alcohol. Fell told lawmakers that the risk of being in a crash greatly in- creases at each blood-alcohol concentration level, and that it rises veryrapidly after a drinker reaches the 0.08 percent level. Most importantly, proponents argue that the change to the 0.08 percent standard will send a strong message that society will nottolerate drinking and driving. \"The new law would simply send a message to the public that the state is getting tough on DWI,\" Fell said.By Grant MartinProponents of lowering Minnesota's blood alcoholconcentration standard from 0.10 percent to 0.08percent will tell you their strongest argument comes from the families of the victims. \"Every day my son looks in the mirror and sees his injuries and it reminds him of the crash,\"said Pat Budig,whose son was severely injured and whose husbandwas killed by an impaired driver who tested below thecurrent 0.10 percent legal limit. \"You don't have to befalling down drunk to kill someone.\" Minnesota drivers would be subject to a more strict definition of legaldrunkenness, under a bill advancing in the House.HF2389 , sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), wouldlower the standard for legal drunk-enness in Minnesota from 0.10 per-cent to 0.08 percent. Budig testifiedin favor of the bill at the Housecommittee hearing on the matter. The bill was approved Feb. 13 by the House Judiciary Commit-tee and referred to the HouseWays and Means Committee.That should be the bill's last stopbefore it goes to the House floor. A similar measure was passed by the House last year. However,the provision did not survive aconference committee and wasnot included in the final 1997omnibus DWI law. If Entenza's current proposal is approved, Minnesota would join15 other states in lowering thelegal blood-alcohol limit for driv-ers from 0.10 percent to 0.08 per-cent. Austria, Australia, Canada, Fin- land, Great Britain, Norway, Swit-zerland, and the Netherlands havea level that is at or below 0.08percent. Sweden's level is 0.02 per- cent. James Fell, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA) official, testified for Entenza's bill at a January committeehearing. He said that the 0.08 percent limit is a reasonable limit to set. The average male would have to drink four standard drinks in an hour and the average female would have to drink three standard drinksin an hour to reach that level, Fell said. A number of factors affect the body's ability to process alcohol, including duration of the drinking, weight, ingestion of food, and \u2014Photo illustraion by Tom Olmscheid and Andrew Von Bank4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998By Nicole Wood Former Rep. Ann Wynia has found a perfect fit in her new job as president ofNorth Hennepin Community College inBrooklyn Park. Being a college president wasn't some- thing Wynia imagined she'd do when shegrew up, she said in a recent interview. \"I don't fit the typical profile,\" she said.But when the opportunity to lead the institution where she has taught since 1970presented itself last year, she realized therelevance of her legislative and executivebranch experience as an administrator. Wynia was first elected to St. Paul's Dis- trict 63B House seat in 1976. During her 13years in the House, she was twice electedmajority leader. She was the first DFLwoman to hold a leadership position in theHouse. Her public service record doesn't end there. Wynia also has been a commissionerof the Department of Human Services anda University of Min-nesota regent. Shewas defeated by RodGrams in a hard-fought 1994 U.S.Senate race. In many ways, Wynia said, for-ward. \"That's what you do in the Legislature,and that's a lot ofwhat you do as a col-lege president,\" shesaid. \"So far it feels like a pretty good fit.\" Looking back at her years in the House, Wynia said she found it most satisfying towork on human services issues, particu-larly on questions of health care access. In 1987, she sponsored the Children's Health Plan, the first program in the na-tion to provide basic preventive care to thechildren of the working poor.Wynia realizes value of pastin new job as college president \"It was very satisfying to be able to say, because we were able to pass this legisla-tion, literally thousands of Minnesota chil-dren who wouldn't have had health carenow are able to go see a doctor,\" she said. Wynia also recalls that the plan had overwhelming bipartisan support. \"It was an opportunity to work on a problem and to present a reasonable cost-effective solution and to see how, by golly,in this process it is possible to bring thatkind of thoughtful solution before a largegroup of legislators and get them to agree,\"she said. In addition to such powerful commit- tees as Taxes and Ways and Means, Wyniaserved on the House Financial Institu-tions and Insurance Committee duringher legislative career. She said she joked with then-Speaker Martin Sabo that she was perfect for theassignment because she was typical of somany Minnesotans \u2014 she had a car insur- ance ahome insurancepolicy and she was of bothbanking insur-ance and Ibrought that per-spective to the com-mittee,\" she said.\"That's what I thinkin some is thebeauty of the representa-tive of the ofthis state.\" Wynia also said she is excited abouther future at North Hennepin. \"At a community college, where we pro- vide open-access, affordable education, Ihave this wonderful opportunity to try tocreate an educational institution here inthe metropolitan area that is going to be ofreal opportunity for a lot of people toimprove their lives,\" she said. \"What awonderful job to have. I am so lucky.\" But Minnesota is already a leader in DWI legislation, according to John Berglund, a lob-byist for the Minnesota Licensed BeverageAssociation. He testified against the bill at a House Judi- ciary Committee meeting. Berglund arguedthat the laws currently on the books should beallowed to work to catch the repeat DWI of-fenders and problem drinkers. And, he said,the state should not target safe, socialdrinkers. Berglund and other opponents point to the fact that NHTSA studies also show that theaverage blood alcohol content found amongdrunk drivers is 0.18 percent and that 80 per-cent of all DWIs are over 0.14 percent. \"By shifting the focus away from the alcohol abuser to the moderate, social drinker, we areshifting resources from the real problem,\" hesaid. \"Changing the legal limit to 0.08 does notget at the problem of the chronic offender,because they ignore the 0.10 limit.\" Opponents of the legislation also point to the fact that eight out of the 10 states thatranked lowest in alcohol-related traffic fatali-ties have 0.10 percent. They argue that if the0.10 percent standard works so well in thesestates, there is no need to lower the standard to0.08 percent. The debate in Minnesota may become purely academic. A bill supported by the presidenthas been introduced in Congress which wouldwithhold 5 percent of federal highway fundingfor states that do not set a standard of 0.08percent. If the federal legislation passes, Minnesota lawmakers may have to act just to save thehighway funding. Committee deadlines Each year, the House sets deadlines by which most bills must be heard in a committee andforwarded. At the first deadline, which wasFriday, Feb. 13, bills must have been passed out ofpolicy committees in their house of origin. The second committee deadline is Friday, Feb. 20, and by then all bills other than those contain-ing appropriations must be passed out of policycommittees in both houses. The deadline does notapply to the finance divisions of the committees orthe House Rules and Legislative AdministrationCommittee, the House Taxes Committee, and theHouse Ways and Means Committee. By the third committee deadline, Friday, Feb. 27, all appropriations bills must clear their policyand finance committees and move to either theTaxes Committee or the Ways and Means Com-mittee.Former Rep. Ann Wynia takes time out of herbusy schedule as president of North HennepinCommunity College to reflect on her years inthe House.5 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 12 - 19, 1998 AGRICULTURE BONDINGFeedlot regulation Two bills that would place more regulation on agricultural feedlots continue to advancein House committees. But a third bill ( HF3320 ) was pulled by its sponsor, Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison),during a Feb. 13 meeting of the House Agri-culture Committee. Peterson's bill would place a moratorium on any new permits for construction of feed-lots for 750 animal units or more (one animalunit equals one slaughter steer or heifer) or theexpansion of open-air manure storage struc-tures. The moratorium would last until July 1,2000, or after the Environmental Quality Boardhas given the Legislature a timeline and costfor doing a Generic Environmental ImpactStatement (GEIS), which would outline thetypes and locations of feedlots in the state andassess their impact on air and water. Feedlots, which are grounds or buildings or a combination of grounds and buildings usedto feed, breed, raise, and hold animals, aredesigned as confinement areas. Feedlots have manure basins, often made of clay or earth, to hold the waste from the live-stock. There are an estimated 45,000 feedlotsin Minnesota. Peterson withdrew the moratorium legisla- tion when it was apparent the bill did not havethe support to survive the Agriculture Com-mittee. \"There are some people who believe it is the right thing to do and the right time to do it,\"Peterson said. \"The issues will not go away.The issues will be in front of the Legislatureagain. The people who have asked for themoratorium have shown the grass roots sup-port for the moratorium.\" Later, Peterson said he wouldn't rule out reviving the bill \u2014 possibly as an amendmentto separate legislation \u2014 later this session. \"Never say never,\" he said, adding that the debate on the issue has shown the Legislaturethe depth of concern in rural Minnesota aboutfeedlots and the impact of corporate farmingon the environment. Meanwhile, a bill ( HF3421 ) sponsored by House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) was approved Feb. 13 by the Agricul-ture Committee and Feb. 16 by the HouseEnvironment, Natural Resources and Agri- culture Finance Committee. The bill nextmoves to House Governmental OperationsCommittee. Winter's bill would forbid permits to in- crease or establish feedlots over certain ca-pacities until the environmental effect of thefeedlot could be examined. The original billwould have required an Environmental Im-pact Statement to be completed, but the billwas amended to instead require an Environ-mental Assessment Worksheet, which costsless. The bill also would ban earthen or clay- lined manure storage facilities after July 1,1998. And the measure would call for a GEISto be conducted. Another separate bill ( HF3441 ) sponsored by Peterson was approved Feb. 13 by the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources Com-mittee and awaits a hearing in the Environ-ment, Natural Resources and AgricultureFinance Committee. The so-called \"Living with Livestock\" bill would require that after March 1, 2000, thosewho manage and apply animal wastes hold avalid animal waste technician license issuedby the Department of Agriculture. Most fam-ily farmers would be exempt. The bill also would prohibit the issuance of a permit for clay, earthen, or plastic-linedanimal waste lagoons. No permit would beissued for a feedlot with a design capacity of1,000 animal units or more until the applicantreceived a federal permit under the CleanWater Act. The bill also would establish astatewide contingency plan to deal with ani-mal waste spills, a county-by-county inven-tory of feedlots, an option for counties toestablish their own feedlot ordinances. Also,the bill would require a GEIS to be conducted. Minnesota grown coupons A pilot project that would establish a pro- gram for low-income families to get \"Minne-sota grown\" food supplies with state-fundedcoupons was approved Feb. 16 by the HouseAgriculture Committee. The bill ( HF3449 ), sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls), calls for the Sustain-able Resources Center in Minneapolis to ad-minister the program. \"It promotes our Minnesota foods andhealthy nutrition for all families. It helps our farms,\" Wejcman said. Under the bill, the Sustainable Resources Center and the Minnesota Food Association,also in Minneapolis, would work together andpick two rural and two urban communities toestablish models for the system. The organizations would work to set up pipelines between the producers and the low-income customers, work with food processorsin the selected cities to hire low-income people,and help grocery stores get authorization toaccept food stamps and the Minnesota growncoupons. Coupons worth $10 would be issued each month by the state Department of Agricultureto people in the selected communities who areeligible. Eligible people would include thosenow getting food stamps whose income is nothigher than 120 percent of the federal povertylevel. The Department of Human Services would provide to the Department of Agriculture thenames of eligible families. The coupons couldbe used only for products using the Minnesotagrown logo. The coupons could be redeemedby food processors, community-supportedfarms, grocery stores, and other retailers. \"We do want to promote the Minnesota agricultural products,\" Wejcman said. \"[Theprogram] is a connecting point for people inagriculture and people who need the food.\" Total costs for the program have not yet been determined. The bill now moves to theHouse Environment, Natural Resources andAgriculture Finance Committee. Bonding recommendations Members of the Economic Development Finance Division of the House Economic De-velopment and International Trade Commit-tee have joked that their $503 million bondingrecommendation plan has started to look likethe Titanic. Currently, it remains to be seen which projects will finally make it to the lifeboats. The plan, approved by the division and the full committee Feb. 18, now sets sail for theHouse Capital Investment Committee, wherethe final cut will be made for the House ver-sion of this year's bonding bill.6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998 The largest portion of the economic devel- opment finance recommendations, a sum of$379 million, would be given in the form ofgrants made to cities and other political subdi-visions for a variety of projects. The remainingportion would be awarded to state agencies todistribute through agency grants. Here are some highlights: Consistent with the governor's proposal, convention centers received a good deal ofattention. The city of Minneapolis wouldreceive $87 million to help finance thecompletion of the Minneapolis ConventionCenter. St. Paul would get $65 million forthe construction of the new RiverCentreArena which would host the new NHLhockey team. Duluth would receive $28 million for the expansion of the Duluth Entertainment andConvention Center. Other convention cen-ter funding would be provided to the citiesof Detroit Lakes, Fergus Falls, Hutchinson,Lake Crystal, Proctor, Rochester, St. Cloud,and Windom. The Department of Trade and Economic Development would receive $60 million tofinance three direct iron processing facilitiesin the state. These plants would produce amore pure form of iron than that producedcurrently, and, supporters argue, give theIron Range an economic edge over otheriron-producing regions. Several local governments would be pro- vided funding for wastewater treatmentprojects. The city of Renville would receive$19 million for their facility. Austin wouldget $6 million for the completion of theirwastewater treatment facility. The Minne-sota Pollution Control Agency would begiven $9 million to fund the wastewaterinfrastructure program which would financeprojects statewide. The city of St. Paul would receive $8 million to help finance the Penumbra Theater ex-pansion. Also, the St. Paul Port Authoritywould be awarded $10 million to redevelopthe Stroh Brewery site. The funds would beused to attract businesses to the site and toassist in job creation for former Stroh em-ployees. The Minnesota Historical Society would re- ceive $25 million to fund improvementsstatewide, including projects at Split RockLighthouse, the Glensheen Mansion, FortSnelling, and St. Anthony Falls. CONSUMERSBurnsville renaissance If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.usHealth care help for patients When patients or their relatives have a ques- tion about a charge from their health careplan, they often don't know who to contact toget the problem solved. A bill passed by the House Financial Institu- tions and Insurance Committee Feb. 17(HF2649 ) might give those people someone to call. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls), would establish an office of healthcare consumer assistance, advocacy, and in-formation. The bill comes from a working group con- vened by the commissioners of the state healthand commerce departments to offer optionsto the Legislature on developing a health carecomplaint resolution process for consumers. Wejcman termed the bill \"a further effort for the consumer of health care to get the carethat they want in a timely manner.\" Susan Stoudt, of the Minnesota Nurses Association, said her organization favors thebill. \"The [working] group was formed with the idea that we want to make our health caresystem work better for consumers,\" she said.\"It became clear that each health plan has afairly complex system for solving problems. \"If a bill isn't real high, most people just pay it rather than spent a lot of time.\"She also said that what people need is some- one to help them figure out what the planoffers and what it doesn't. \"[People need] someone who, as an advo- cate, will help them wind their way throughthe system,\" Stoudt said. The new office would have no regulatory power and would not provide legal represen-tation, but it could act as an advocate in adispute resolution process. The bill also stipu-lates that the office would be run by an execu-tive director, who could hire nine advocates towork in the office. The office would try to help consumers understand their legal rights and get healthcare referrals. The office also would attempt toidentify patterns of complaints and recom-mend possible changes to health carecompanies. The committee heard some opposition to the bill, specifically from Twila Brase, a publichealth nurse from Citizens for Choice in HealthCare, a St. Paul-based group. \"If passed, citizens would be paying twice: once in taxes, once in premiums. The costestimates we heard are $700,000, and as weknow, real costs exceed estimates,\" Brase said. The bill calls for a still-unspecified appro- priation to fund the new office. \"It's a bad policy and will not help protect people and may increase healthcare costs,\"Brase said. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), who is a doctor, said he opposes the bill because it isBurnsville City Engineer Chuck Ahl describes his city's proposed riverfront renaissance project.The proposal calls for 226 acres of trails, a park, and an amphitheater to be built along theMinnesota River. Members of the House Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committeediscussed the plan Feb. 17.7 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYEDUCATIONSCHOOL CRIMEadding a level of bureaucracy. Health care companies should be answering their con-sumers' questions and helping solve their prob-lems on their own, he said. The bill now moves to the House Govern- mental Operations Committee. Repeat violent offenders The House Judiciary Committee approved two bills Feb. 13 that would crack down onrepeat violent offenders. HF24, sponsored by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), would require life imprisonmentfor criminals convicted of three violent felony-level crimes. Responding to the concerns of the mem- bers of the committee, Weaver amended hisbill to exempt some felony offenses from thelist of applicable crimes. Weaver also addedprovisions that would give judges discretionin applying the life prison term under certaincircumstances. Scott Swanson, an attorney with the state public defender's office, testified in opposi-tion to the bill. He told the committee that thepenalties would not always be proportional. \"It doesn't matter if my third offense is selling a line [of cocaine] or murder, I still getlife in prison,\" he said. Deb Dailey, of the Sentencing Guidelines Commission, said that it is difficult to esti-mate the increase in prison population thatcould come from Weaver's bill because of themany factors involved. She told the commit-tee that it could mean as many as 2,300 addi-tional prison beds over the next 30 years. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) said that people who come from violent back-grounds often turn their lives around andbecome productive members of society. Hesaid that he thinks the three strikes approachis simplistic. \"We're using baseball analogies to apply to the violent problems that exist in our nation,\"he said. Weaver said that a strong message must be sent. \"I don't mind that this is simplistic,\"Weaver said. \"We need to lay down a clear lineto what is acceptable.\" Weaver's bill was approved by the commit- tee on a 17-2 vote. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) is spon- soring a separate bill that also would addressrepeat violent offenders. HF2286 would re- structure current law that requires tougherpenalties for \"career criminals\" and wouldreduce the number of violent crimes requiredto receive these harsher sentences.Both bills are set to be included in the om- nibus crime prevention bill. Searching adults, juveniles Officer Mark Klukow, of the Minneapolis Police Department, told members of the HouseJudiciary Committee Feb. 13 that he found itdifficult to understand why adults and juve-niles are treated differently when it comes tosearch law. He said that he was surprised to see cases against juveniles thrown out of court because,under current law, pat down searches can beperformed only on adult offenders. Klukow, who frequently is forced to detain truant juveniles in his squad car, said he al-ways does a pat down search before putting asuspect in his car. \"It's an officer safety issue,\" Klukow said. \"It's probably done at least once a week wherea weapon is found.\" Klukow testified in support of a bill (HF2330 ) sponsored by Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) which would authorize pat downsearches of juveniles. \"I don't understand why a juvenile is any different from an adult,\" he said. \"In fact, Ithink a juvenile is more likely to shoot some-one. They don't understand the conse-quences.\" The committee approved the bill, which is set to be included in this year's omnibus crimeprevention bill. Prostitution penalties The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill Feb. 13 that would increase penalties forengaging in the business of prostitution in aresidential area or near children. HF2375 , sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), borrows from current law thenotion that crimes committed in school zones,park zones, and public housing zones shouldbe sentenced more severely. The bill also would make changes to make it easier to get juveniles who are involved inprostitution into the child protection system. Clark said that while the harsher penalties are necessary, she is also concerned aboutchildren being used as prostitutes. \"Young children are being solicited into prostitution. The average entry age is 14 yearsold,\" she said. Clark told the committee that the law needs to view children involved in prostitution asvictims and not as criminals. HF2375 is set to be included in this year's omnibus crime prevention bill.State Board of Education A proposal to abolish the State Board of Education has been scaled back to call only fora task force to study the agency's effectivenessand report back to lawmakers by next year. Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) said he was under the influence of \"freshman zeal\" whenhe included a provision to abolish the board inHF1678 , which was introduced last year. The amended version of his bill is now being considered by the K-12 Education Fi-nance Division of the House Education Com-mittee for inclusion in this year's omnibuseducation funding bill. The board itself sup-ports the proposal. The plan now calls for a 15-member task force to examine alternatives for governingthe state's K-12 education system. The groupwould be assembled by this summer and wouldreport its findings by February 1999. \"I think a lot of people have been looking at the State Board of Education, trying to discernwhat its role really is,\" Biernat said. \"Maybethis will lead to abolishing the board, but thatwill depend on the [results of] the study.\" The bill would direct the task force to look specifically at three areas: the current role ofvarious government agencies in shaping edu-cation policy; the effectiveness of the currentstructure; and how to improve collaborationbetween schools and social service agenciesserving the same populations. The task force would include educators, government representatives, and communitymembers. Those members would be appointedwith input from the governor's office, thespeaker of the House, and the Senate Rulesand Administration Committee. On-site suspension programs Suspending students from school has little effect if they're merely sent home, but keepingthem in a supervised in-school suspensionprogram can both help them improve aca-demically and deter future suspensions. That's what Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) said is the premise behind his bill toencourage schools to implement on-site sus-pension programs. \"We realize that a full reform [of Minnesota's K-12 system] is really needed, but until then,this is an important Band-Aid,\" he said. His bill ( HF3664 ) would give schools $4 per day for each suspended student placed in anin-school program. The K-12 Education Finance Division of8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998 the House Education Committee discussed the proposal Feb. 18 and is considering in-cluding it in this year's omnibus K-12 educa-tion finance bill. Gordon Leverets, who supervises such a program at St. Paul's J.J. Hill Montessori Mag-net School, told the panel that the fundingwould allow improvements in existingprograms. \"Sometimes my room becomes a dumping ground,\" he said. \"A lot of times there is nowork sent with the students.\" He said funding could help develop a solid, school-wide program involving moreteachers. But any in-school program, he said, is bet- ter than sending students home, or, morelikely, onto the streets. \"There's no doubt that students who get sent home too often will begin to feel alienatedfrom the school,\" he said. Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), who chairs the division, said she believes manydistricts have moved away from the in-schoolsuspensions common in past decades becauseof money shortages. Other lawmakers agreed that keeping sus- pended students in school is preferable tosending them to unsupervised homes. \"But we need to look at how to make these become places of learning,\" Rep. TonyKielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) said. \"It a dumping ground.\" EMPLOYMENTBlack history 'No-man's-land' Several Minnesota school districts got caught in what one superintendent called \"no-man's-land\" after a 1997 law required them topay state prevailing wage labor rates for con-struction projects. About 14 districts faced unexpectedly higher price tags on building projects because theyhad passed bond referendums for estimatedcosts before the law's July 1, 1997, effectivedate. By the time they signed contracts, theprevailing-wage law had inflated labor pricesin those districts. \"I don't argue with prevailing wage. I be- lieve people have a right to earn a living,\" Lakeof the Woods Schools Superintendent RalphChristofferson told a House panel Feb. 19.\"But we went to the taxpayers with one set ofrules, and then they changed. We were unableto deliver to our constituents what we prom-ised.\" HF2822 , sponsored by Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester), would bring relief toChristofferson's district and others aroundthe state. The bill proposes awarding grants to dis-tricts that can prove they either incurred extra costs or had to scale back construction plansdue to the prevailing wage law. So far 14districts \u2014 mostly in rural areas of the statewhere labor wages were low to begin with \u2014have said they would qualify. The plan calls for $6.6 million in grants to be awarded. Districts could only use the fundsto meet increased costs due to the prevailingwage requirement. The K-12 Education Finance Division of the House Education Committee is consider-ing the proposal for inclusion in this year'somnibus K-12 education finance bill. Extra-curricular activities A slightly watered-down proposal aimed at assuring home-schooled students access topublic school extra-curricular activities is be-ing considered by state lawmakers. HF2836 , sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL- St. Cloud), would require school districts tocharge home-schooled and public school stu-dents the same fee for extra-curricular activities. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center), a co-sponsor of the bill,said some districts set prohibitive fees forhome-schoolers to participate in activities. \"But these parents pay property taxes like everyone else,\" he said. When the House Education Committee first discussed the bill Feb. 3, the proposal calledfor school boards to allow all home-schooledstudents residing in a district to participate inextra-curricular activities. But school board officials objected to that language and said schools could find them-selves forced to allow any home-schooled childto participate in any activity, regardless ofother qualifications. The amended bill calls for home-school and public school students to be equally eligiblefor participation. \"It's acceptable to those who were inter- ested in securing some changes for home-schoolers, but also addresses those concernsraised by school boards,\" Opatz said. The Education Committee's K-12 Educa- tion Finance Division debated the new planFeb. 18 and is considering the bill for inclusionin this year's K-12 omnibus funding bill. Unpaid parental leave A bill that would grant more workers the option of taking up to 12 weeks of unpaidparental leave was approved Feb. 13 by theHouse Labor-Management RelationsCommittee. Currently, employees of firms with more than 50 workers are entitled under federal lawto 12 weeks of leave following the birth oradoption of a child. Minnesota law provides up to six weeks of unpaid leave for parents working for compa-nies with 21 to 49 employees. HF3444 , spon- sored by Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls), wouldextend that to 12 weeks and allow the leave tobegin at any time within 12 weeks of birth oradoption. \"This is a bill which is in conformity with the history of this body,\" Mullery said. Minnesota was one of the first states to grant any parental leave, but in the last decade,the federal government and several other stateshave passed laws allowing longer unpaid leaves. Pat McGovern, of the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health, said stud-ies show longer leaves significantly improveboth the mother's health and the baby's devel-opment. Toinette Battle Bettis, office manager for theHouse Public Information portraysabolitionist Sojourner Truth delivering herspeech, \"Ain't a Woman?\" in the Housechamber. Bettis' performance, marking BlackHistory Month, served as the invocation toopen the House floor session Feb. 16.9 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY She also cited a study showing that more than 90 percent of employers reported little orno increased costs or disruptions associatedwith parental leaves. But Michael Hickey, of the National Fed- eration of Independent Business-Minnesota,said the proposal would have \"very negativeimplications\" for small businesses. \"How do these businesses try to continue on and remain profitable with the loss of a keyperson for three months?\" Hickey asked. \"Ona six-week basis, you probably haven't heardany complaints because anyone can carry onfor six weeks.\" Tom Hesse, of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, said requiring employers to allowunpaid leave may eliminate explorations ofother options \u2014 such as flexible schedulingand job sharing \u2014 that may be more benefi-cial for everyone. Mullery said his bill would not affect those employers already making acceptable arrange-ments for new parents. \"But if we relied solely on the goodwill of employers, we wouldn't need unions, wewouldn't need labor laws, we wouldn't haveslave shops around the world,\" he said. The bill, which now moves to the House floor, was approved by the committee on an11-6 vote. ENVIRONMENTJoanne Wesley, a lactation specialist at theMinnesota Department of Health, testifies aboutthe benefits of breast milk for infants. She appearedin support of a bill that would require employersto provide reasonable unpaid break time and aprivate space for nursing mothers to pump breastmilk. The bill was before the House Labor-Management Relations Committee Feb. 16. Workplace breast-feeding New mothers may soon find it easier to continue breast-feeding their infants oncethey've returned to work, under a plan ap-proved Feb. 16 by a House panel. HF3459 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), would require employers to\"make reasonable efforts\" to provide spaceand unpaid break time at work for mothers topump breast milk that they could later feed totheir babies. \"This is an attempt to put some minimal standards in place,\" Greiling said. \"'Reason-able effort' means just that. We're not askingfor anybody to build an extra room onto aworkplace.\" The bill does specify that the space provided should be other than a toilet stall and shouldbe close to the work area. It would not requireemployers to provide break time if to do sowould \"unduly disrupt\" the business. With several national studies showing the benefits of breast-feeding to include healthierbabies, more productive employees, and asmarter future workforce, there was no out-right opposition to the bill during the hearingbefore the House Labor-Management Rela-tions Committee. But some lawmakers and small-businesslobbyists voiced concern about vague lan- guage in the bill. \"We want lactation, not Mark Olson (R-Big Lake) said. \"I don't thinkwe're going to get very far if all we do is createmore reasons for litigation.\" Michael Hickey, state director of the Na- tional Federation of Independent Business-Minnesota, said he was also concerned aboutpotential court battles over the interpretationof the bill's call for \"reasonable\" accommoda-tions. \"We think the goals of the bill are very laudable,\" he said. \"But the smaller you are,the more difficult it's going to get. We're con-cerned for the two-person gas station or retailshop.\" He said eventually he may seek an exemp- tion for businesses with 10 or feweremployees. The bill now moves to the House floor. A companion Senate measure \u2014 sponsored bySen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St. Paul) whobreast-fed her son, Jack, while serving at theCapitol last year \u2014 is headed for the Senatefloor.Raising the minimum wage A proposal to raise the minimum wage by 75 cents was approved by the House Labor-Management Relations Committee Feb. 13,but even some supporters of the plan say it'sunlikely to get past the governor's desk. The bill ( HF3440 ), sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), would set the mini-mum wage for large employers at $5.90 perhour beginning Sept. 1, 1998, and for smallemployers at $5.65 per hour beginning Jan. 1,1999. But the measure would allow employersto pay workers under age 20 a wage of $5 anhour for the first 90 days of employment. \"You know [the bill] will pass the commit- tee, and you know it will pass the House. Butif it goes to the governor and gets hammered,we've accomplished nothing,\" Rep. MikeOsskopp (R-Lake City) said, during the HouseLabor-Management Relations Committeemeeting. In light of the fact that federal lawmakers are considering a 50-cent minimum wage hikethis year, Osskopp suggested Rukavina's billmay have a better chance at becoming law if itsimply set Minnesota's minimum wage at 25cents higher than federal minimum wage. But Bernard Brommer, president of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, said that historically thefederal government has increased minimumwage only after several states have led the waywith increases. The committee also rejected an amend- ment that would have built a so-called tipcredit into the proposed increase. Rukavinasaid that allowing employers to pay tippedworkers less than minimum wage would leadto labor exploitation and \"drag everyone else'swages down.\" Rukavina's bill now moves to the House floor. Transport packaging waste A bill that aims to reduce the amount of transport packaging waste the soft drinkindustry creates was approved by the HouseCommerce, Tourism and Consumer AffairsCommittee Feb. 17. \"Of all the major pieces of legislation I've carried over the years, this is the first time I'vehad a bill with the support of the environmen-tal people and the industry,\" said Rep. WillardMunger (DFL-Duluth), the sponsor of the bill(HF2696/SF2402* ). In 1995, Munger said, 22 percent of munici- pal solid waste consisted of transport packag- If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.us10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998ing such as wood pallets and corrugated card- board. Dave Locey, of the Minnesota Soft Drink Association, said the industry is considering a$15 million investment in reusable, recyclableplastic pallets. The plastic pallets would cost about $32 each, Locey said, compared to $5 to $7 each forthe wood pallets the industry currently uses totransport their goods to retailers. There is a system in place, Locey explained, where third parties collect used pallets fromretail sites and then resell them to soft drinkcompanies. Under the bill, third party collectors would be prohibited from taking those plastic palletswhich are labeled as private property. The plastic pallet would have to clearly show the owner's name and address or telephonenumber, as well as a notice that the unautho-rized possession of the pallet is a violation ofstate law. The rightful owner of a stolen plastic pallet would be entitled to damages equal to threetimes the cost of the pallet, in addition to legalexpenses. Some on the panel questioned the need for special legislation to protect owners of plasticpallets, but Locey answered many of theconcerns. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont), a grocer, wondered whether a deposit system betweenmanufacturers and retailers would workinstead. Locey said retailers would not accept a de- posit system. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) asked why unlawful pallet possession couldn't be pros-ecuted under existing theft laws. \"An old system already exists that's working against us,\" Locey said. \"We're in the positionof trying to make a pro-environmental systemwork. What we want to do before we make this$15 million investment in plastic pallets ismake sure we can control them.\" The bill now moves to the House floor. A second grade class from Mora Fairview Elementary School makes the sound of rain with theirlong rattles as Peg Paulson reads \"Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain\" in the Capitol rotunda. Theperformance was one of several by students from around the state as part of Arts Education DayFeb. 17.Rain makers Gypsy moths The gypsy moths are coming, and the De- partment of Agriculture wants $325,000 tostop them at the border. The leaf-eating insects have already infested Michigan and Wisconsin and are slowlymarching westward at the rate of 12 miles peryear, according to Daniel Stoddard of the De-partment of Agriculture's gypsy moth trap-ping and eradication program. Armed with a jar full of moths and a bro- chure entitled \"Gypsy Moth: Street, Yard andForest Tree Enemy #1,\" Stoddard brought theprogram's funding request to the House Envi- ronment, Natural Resources and AgricultureFinance Committee Feb. 18. The committee took no action on the mat- ter. Gypsy moths are transported by human activity, Stoddard explained. The metropoli-tan area and southeastern Minnesota are athighest risk of an invasion. Although female gypsy moths cannot fly, they frequently deposit their eggs on objectssuch as grills and picnic tables that are near thetrees on which they feed. Thus, gypsy mothsearned their name due to their preferred modeof migration \u2014 tagging along on outdoorobjects. Wisconsin spends over $2 million per year for gypsy moth control, Stoddard said, andMinnesota would already be infested withoutprevious eradication efforts. In past years, the department has sent out field workers to capture male gypsy moths insticky traps that are baited with female mothscents. To date, the program has discovered and exterminated 19 startup gypsy moth popula-tions, Stoddard said. The agriculture department's lab is devel- oping biological control agents such as para-sites that feed on gypsy moth eggs. The money would supplement the biologi- cal control program and allow for more fieldpersonnel. The funding request will be considered again later this session.Personal watercraft measures A bill that would strictly limit the use of personal watercraft on Minnesota's lakes isheaded for the House floor. HF1351 , sponsored by Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), was approved by the HouseEnvironment, Natural Resources and Agri-culture Finance Committee Feb. 19. The bill is made up of provisions that were formerly part of HF1690 , Hasskamp's origi- nal bill related to personal watercraft. In order to separate the financial consider- ations from the policy debate, the personalwatercraft legislation has been divided intotwo separate bills. Among its policy provisions, HF1351 would ban personal watercraft from lakes of 200acres in size or less, limit the hours for full-throttle operation, and increase the no-wakezone to 200 feet from shoreline, docks, swim-mers, or other watercraft. The financial implications of the personal watercraft legislation remain in HF1690 . Un- der that bill, personal watercraft operatorswould be required to pass a mandatory safetycourse and pay a $10 fee for a certificate, anda $30 fee for three-year personal watercraftlicenses would be established. The fees wouldbe earmarked for counties and the Depart-ment of Natural Resources for personal wa-tercraft law enforcement costs. HF1351 \u2014 the policy bill \u2014 now moves to the House floor. HF1690 remains before the House Envi- ronment, Natural Resources and AgricultureFinance Committee.11 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYGAME & FISH GOVERNMENT Hunting, fishing privileges A bill that aims to amend the Minnesota Constitution to protect hunting and fishingprivileges is one step closer to being placed onthe ballot in the November 1998 general elec-tion. HF326 , sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), was approved by the HouseEnvironment, Natural Resources and Agri-culture Finance Committee Feb. 18. The bill would submit the following consti- tutional amendment to voters: \"Shall the Min-nesota Constitution be amended to declare aprivilege of legal residents to take game andfish in accordance with law and regulations?\" The committee focused its discussion on the bill's potential financial implications ratherthan policy concerns. The Department of Finance estimates that the overall administrative costs to place a con-stitutional amendment on the ballot wouldequal $114,300. Roger Holmes, director of the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Department of Natu-ral Resources (DNR), said there would be noextra enforcement expenses if voters approvedthe amendment. The DNR supports the bill in the hope that \"some of the efforts to reduce hunting andfishing opportunities would cease,\" Holmessaid. \"It would send a clear message to anti-hunting groups that they should back off.\" The bill now moves to the House Judiciary Committee. Residency requirement Despite opposition from Minneapolis city officials and legislators from the city, a Housecommittee approved a bill Feb. 17 that wouldrepeal the authority of the cities of Minneapo-lis and St. Paul to require their employees tolive within city limits. The House Local Government and Metro- politan Affairs Committee's vote to approvethe came after nearly 90 min- utes of testimony from the opponents of themeasure. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) was among those who urged committee members to re-ject the bill. \"We believe that if they desire to work for the city of Minneapolis, they should live withus,\" he said. \"If they feel it's a terrible place,perhaps they needn't work for the city of Min- neapolis.\" Proponents, mostly police officers, testified at an earlier meeting. They argued that theresidency requirements make life difficult andsometimes dangerous for their children be-cause the officers' families must live in thesame neighborhoods as people the officershave arrested in the past or otherwise encoun-tered on the job. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R- Maple Grove), a Minneapolis police officer,would also repeal residency requirements foremployees of the Minneapolis School District,the city's library board, and the city's park andrecreation board. Similar residency requirements for the city of St. Paul also would be wiped out. A 1993 law established the residency re- quirements in Minneapolis, and St. Paul's resi-dency requirements were added in 1994.Employees hired before the requirements tookeffect can live anywhere they want. Opponents of Stanek's bill said the resi- dency requirements are a local issue that canbe negotiated by the employee bargainingunits, and the state should not interfere. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) noted that one city employee had said previously, \"It'sbad enough I have to work in the city; Ishouldn't have to live in it, too.\" Skoglund said that remark offended him deeply. \"They're wrong. They're completely wrong. Think how you would feel if they said thatabout your city,\" he said. He said it was good to see off-duty police officers in the neighborhoods and at the com-munity functions as citizens. HEALTH David Grant and Jeanne Grimm, members of the nonprofit Screenwriters Workshop, perform amini-script in front of the Economic Development Finance Division of the House EconomicDevelopment and International Trade Committee. The pair testified Feb. 12 on behalf of a billsponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman that would help develop Minnesota-made screenplays.Minnesota screenwritersLeonard Mangum, a community organizer who works with gang members, said the rela-tionships he has established with the policesince more of them started living in the city arevaluable. \"I've had a chance to witness the interaction between police officers and inner-city youth.It's not about forcing [police officers] to livethere; it's about trying to build relationships,\"he said. Mangum said he was aware of the problems police officers had voiced about safety in anearlier meeting, and he said he understood. \"We have a great relationship now and what that allows us to do is effectively promotechange,\" he said. Minneapolis City Council member Jackie Cherryhomes said when city employees live inthe city, it promotes \"a deeper understandingof the problems facing our city, but also adeeper commitment to helping solve them.\" The bill moves to the House floor. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Minnesota first lady Susan Carlson said women of childbearing age need better infor-mation about the danger of drinking duringpregnancy, but the word isn't getting out. She said a birth defect caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy is \"100 per-cent preventable,\" and she is supporting a billthat would raise public awareness of FetalAlcohol Syndrome (FAS). The House Health and Human Services12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998 Committee approved a bill Feb. 18 that would provide $5 million for a statewide campaign toexpand awareness of the disease. The bill(HF3343 ) is sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior). Carlson was co-chair of the Governor's Task Force on FAS, which conservatively estimatedthe disease costs Minnesota $45 million annu-ally in health, judicial, and social services. \"This is very costly,\" Carlson said. \"You can't repair brain damage once it occurs.\" FAS is a series of birth defects that can include mental retardation, central nervoussystem dysfunction, behavioral problems, anddeficient growth. Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) isa less severe set of the same symptoms. The Journal of the American Medical Asso- ciation reports FAS is the leading known causeof mental retardation. It is found in all racesand economic groups. Dr. Pi-Nian Chang, a pediatric psycholo- gist, told legislators he sees 30 children monthlywho, because their mothers consumed alco-hol during pregnancy, have IQs as low as 66. Chang said those with FAS or FAE who are not mentally retarded have learning disabili-ties and often exhibit impulsive behavior. Hesaid studies indicate FAS is present in 1 to 3percent of all live births Chang called drinkingfor all pregnant women \"Russian roulette.\" Sykora said studies show at least 25 percent of death row inmates and youths in correc-tional facilities have FAS or FAE. Of the $5 million request, $850,000 would Minnesota first lady Susan Carlson, left, co-chair of the Governor's Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, testifies in support of a bill that would fund ongoing research on the disease. Rep. Barb Sykora, center , the bill's sponsor, and Dr. Pi-Nian Chang, director of pediatric psychology at the University of Minnesota,also appeared before the House Health and Human Services Committee Feb. 17.establish a grant program for community-based organizations to specialize in preven-tion and intervention of both FAS and FAE.Another $850,000 would expand treatmentservices for pregnant women and women withchildren, and $800,000 would be used to raisepublic awareness. The bill also includes funding requests for the study of FAS and FAE, the establishmentof diagnostic clinics, and training for healthcare providers. According to the NationalOrganization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, lessthan 10 percent of medical schools requirestudents to complete a course on the properdiagnosis and referral of individuals withalcohol addiction. The House Governmental Operations Com- mittee also approved the bill, which now isheaded to the Health and Human ServicesFinance Division. Battling AIDS Although progress is being made in the fight against AIDS, the battleground is con-stantly shifting. Dr. Timothy Schacker, medical director of the University of Minnesota Delaware StreetClinic, said there are misconceptions aboutnew AIDS medications, and because AIDSpatients are living longer, the chances of sexualcontact with an HIV-infected person haverisen.Schacker testified in support of a bill (HF3022 ) sponsored by Rep. Ruth Johnson (DFL-St. Peter) that would appropriate$550,000 from the general fund for preven-tion initiatives against sexually transmitteddiseases, including AIDS. The House Health and Human Services Committee approved the bill Feb. 16. Schacker said most new cases of AIDS occur in women and teens. And he said transmissionof AIDS through heterosexual sex is an issuethat needs amplification. Schacker said it is important that the public not become complacent because of so-called\"AIDS cocktails\" and other advancements indrug treatment of the disease. The bill requests $250,000 for the state commissioner of health to conduct researchon the prevalence of sexually transmitted dis-eases in the state, and $125,000 to conductlaboratory screening. The committee was told some community clinics reject people who want testing but can'tpay for it. Another $125,000 would help thecommissioner of health prepare a plan aimedat reducing all sexually transmitted diseases. The bill moves to the committee's finance division. Ephedrine-containing products Sale of readily available products contain- ing a Chinese herb that acts as a stimulantwould be restricted under a bill the HouseHealth and Human Service Committee ap-proved Feb. 16. The targeted products containing ephedrine are reportedly taken by teenagers and otherslooking to achieve a legal high. Health food stores, supermarkets, and phar- macies stock products containing ephedrine,the extract of a Chinese herb that has beenfound to stimulate the heart and central ner-vous system. The Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) has tried to build a case againstephedrine-containing products, which aremarketed as diet products but are used byteenagers as a stimulant. HF3549 , sponsored by Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul), would allow productscontaining ephedrine to be dispensed only byprescription in most instances. The bill would stipulate that drug products containing ephedrine could be sold without aprescription only if allowable under the fed-eral Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Such prod-ucts could not be marketed, advertised, orlabeled for weight loss, appetite control, muscleenhancement, mental alertness, or energy. Currently, marketers need not show ephe-13 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY drine-containing products to be safe or effec- tive because the Dietary Supplement Healthand Education Act of 1994 classified herbs,vitamins, and minerals as dietary supplements.The FDA cannot regulate dietary supplementsunless it can prove a product is unsafe. The FDA has tried to link about 36 deaths to the targeted supplements, which can containwidely varying degrees of the herb. The bill moves to the House Judiciary Committee. HIGHER EDUCATION Rep. Alice Johnson plays a computer game with her brain waves while hooked up to a neuro-feedback machine. New Visions School provided an opportunity at the Capitol Feb. 16 forlawmakers and the public to learn about their program designed to help students boostacademic performance by helping them focus and concentrate.Brain power'Grade 13' credit proposal Parents of college freshmen would be eli- gible for a new tax credit, under a bill that aimsto make postsecondary education more af-fordable for Minnesota families. HF3691 , sponsored by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), would allow families of recenthigh school graduates to realize a state taxcredit of $500. The Higher Education FinanceDivision of the House Education Committeetook no action on the bill Feb. 16. Coupled with a newly established $1,500 federal income tax credit \u2014 called the HopeScholarship Credit \u2014 the bill would make thefirst year of postsecondary education moreaffordable for many Minnesotans. Starting in 1998, most Minnesota students who enroll in a postsecondary institution inthe fall after their high school graduation wouldbe eligible. The students would have to beclaimed as a dependent on their parents' in-come tax return. Supporters claim the bill would, in effect, establish a grade 13 in Minnesota. Carlson said the bill would cost the state between $7.5 million and $8.5 million annu-ally. The first year of college or other trainingwould still have to be paid for, but Carlsonsaid the annual cost of one year of technical orcommunity college typically runs about $2,000.With the federal and state tax credits, a familycould cover most of that expense, he said. Under the federal Taxpayer Relief Act, tax- payers became eligible Jan. 1 to claim a HopeScholarship Credit against their federal in-come taxes. The Hope Credit can be claimedfor the qualified tuition and related educationexpenses of each student in the taxpayer'sfamily. Taxpayers will be able to claim thefederal credit for the first time when they filetheir 1998 tax returns next year. Minnesota's proposed \"grade 13 credit\" would use the same income thresholds as thefederal credit. For married couples filingjointly, the upper income limit for the fullcredit is $80,000. For single parents, it is$40,000. Benefits are phased out above those limits, with total phase out at $100,000 and$50,000, respectively. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) ques- tioned the need for the state to assist familieswho earn $80,000 annually. Carlson said he believes those families could use some \"tuition relief.\" He also distributed afact sheet indicating students who get throughone year of postsecondary education are likelyto complete their college education. Carlson also said experts suggest the de- mand for technical skills means most futureworkers will need some postsecondary train-ing and that his bill could help respond to that. The proposal will be considered for pos- sible inclusion in this year's omnibus highereducation bill. Campus law firm Lawmakers are considering a proposal that would boost the University of Minnesota'slaw clinic, which is essentially a law firm oncampus. According to Steve Befort, director of the clinic, more than 700 low-income Minneso-tans were represented by second- and third-year U of M law students in 1997. The studentsrepresent clients under supervision of clinicinstructors. Befort told the Higher Education Finance Division of the House Education CommitteeFeb. 16 that with $250,000 from the state forfiscal year 1999 the school could add 80 morestudents to the law clinic. That would trans-late into an additional 6,000 hours of legalservices and another 200 clients, Befort said. The request is part of HF3251 , which is spon- sored by Rep. Gene Pelowski Jr. (DFL-Winona),who chairs the finance division. The proposalwill be considered for inclusion in this year'somnibus higher education funding bill. Jeffrey Brockmann, a third-year U of M law student, testified that the clinical education heacquired was crucial to his scholastic advance-ment in the program and better prepared himto practice law. \"It has made me aware of the diverse need of a clientele that generally goes unnoticed,\"Brockmann said. Tom Sullivan, dean of the law school, added the clinic work \"helps us understand the ethicalobligation we have to support our community.\" Sullivan said only 25 percent of law school graduates nationally have any clinical expo-sure, but 65 percent of U of M students havethe opportunity. Sullivan also said 50 percent of the clinic's current $900,000 annual budget comes fromtuition, with 15 to 17 percent from the state.The rest comes through private contributionsand through a federal grant. HOUSING Substandard housing Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) told a House committee Feb. 17 that housing agen-cies all over the country are looking at ways torehabilitate housing and that sometimes demo-lition is the only option. Trimble is sponsoring a bill ( HF3565 ) that14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998would provide an appropriation to the com- munity rehabilitation fund. The program isused by cities to purchase substandard mul-tiple housing units for either rehabilitation ordemolition. \"I just feel in some cases, in some situations, it makes more sense in the long run to get ridof substandard housing,\" he said during testi-mony before the Housing and Housing Fi-nance Division of the House EconomicDevelopment and International TradeCommittee. Often times, problem housing is removed to make green space or community parks forpublic housing, Trimble said. St. Paul city councilwoman Kathy Lantry said that her city would benefit from the pro-gram. She told the committee that she hastoured some of the troubled properties inSt. Paul. \"The conditions of those properties made me mad. The fact that housing like this existsin St. Paul should make us truly ashamed,\" shesaid. \"Sometimes the right answer is to teardown the building.\" She said that in some situations housing is \"affordable by accident\" because the poor con-dition of the property drives the rent down. Lantry said that the property owners need to be held accountable for disrepair and needto be encouraged to develop proper screeningpolicies to keep problem tenants out of theproperties. Charles Disney, of the Minneapolis Prop- erty Rights Action Committee, said that citygovernments and neighborhood organizationsare attempting to place the blame solely on theproperty owners. He said the true problem iscrime and a lack of law enforcement. \"We've criminalized housing to solve our social problems because the criminal justicesystem is not working,\" he said. \"I think it'sadding fuel to the fire to tear down housing.It's not getting at the problem.\" Karla Wiegold, of Brooklyn Park, said she is concerned about reducing the level of afford-able housing. She told the committee that thehousing complex where she lives is scheduledfor demolition as a substandard property. Wiegold said that there needs to be a stan- dard set so that low income housing is notrazed just to provide land for more expensivedevelopment. The bill was laid over by the committee but could be considered again later in the session.INSURANCE Auto insurance break The break on insurance premiums that driv- ers over the age of 55 get when they take anaccident prevention course would be availableto drivers of all ages, under a bill passed by theHouse Feb. 19. HF2846 , sponsored by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington), passed on a 71-59 vote. Mahon said most people, after taking driver's education in high school, rarely getfurther driving instruction throughout theiradult lives. Getting a refresher course in safetymight make the roads safer, he said. The courses now offered for older drivers are often called \"55 Alive\" courses, and drivers55 or older get reduced auto insurance premi-ums by taking an accident prevention courseevery three years. Drivers of any age who take the safety course would get a 10 percent discount on their auto-mobile insurance premiums, under Mahon'sbill. The Department of Public Safety wouldadopt rules establishing and regulating theaccident prevention course. Those rules wouldestablish curriculum requirements and hoursfor the course. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) ques- tioned whether the bill would provide realsavings for consumers. \"They might increase the rates for every- body,\" Swenson said. \"I understand [Mahon's]intentions are well-meant, but I'm just con-cerned we may have the opposite impact ofwhat we're intending.\" TAXESSAFETY 'R-Bar' restraint system School districts could apply for grants to demonstrate the effectiveness of a passive re-straint system on school buses, under a billadvancing in the House. HF2638 , sponsored by Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park), was approved Feb. 17by the finance division of the House Trans-portation and Transit Committee. At least six school districts have expressed interest in the program, according to Rep. PegLarsen (R-Lakeland), a co-sponsor of the bill. The proposal calls for a total of 20 buses used in urban and rural settings to be used totest the restraints, which are similar to the barsused on roller coasters. The \"R-Bar\" passenger restraint system costs $200 per seat, and there are 24 seats on anaverage school bus. Under the bill, $200,000would be appropriated for restraint system grants, with up to $40,000 to be used for theevaluation of the system's effectiveness. The R-Bar system has undergone 11 years of testing and development. Its stated advantageover seat belts on school buses is that thesystem contains riders but does not confinethem. Because a passenger can easily slidesideways out of the bus seat, the R-Bar systemreduces the likelihood a child would be trappedon a school bus. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), school bustransportation is among the safer modes ofhighway transportation in the country. Itsfigures indicate 394,000 public school busestravel 4.3 billion miles to transport 3.5 millionchildren annually. Since 1984, an average of 11 children have died each year in school bus crashes. In com-parison, the NHTSA figures for 1995 show8,168 children between the ages of 5 and 20died as passengers in all other types of motorvehicles. A 1989 National Academy of Sciences study concluded potential benefits from seat beltson large school buses did not justify a federalrequirement for mandatory installation. Asubsequent NHTSA study concluded the bestway to provide crash protection for school busriders was to protect the occupants withoutmaking them buckle up. Luther sponsored a bill during the 1997 session that included a call for lap and shoul-der safety belts to be installed on school busesbeginning this year. But the seat belt provi-sions in that bill were deleted in a Housecommittee. The R-Bar proposal now moves to the full Transportation and Transit Committee. Charitable gambling The state taxes the money raised by chari- table gambling in Minnesota, and most of theremaining proceeds go to whatever charity thegambling supports. Some lawmakers are looking to reduce the overall tax burden on organizations that con-duct charitable gambling. Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) and Rep. Roxann Daggett (R-Frazee) are sponsor-ing separate bills that would reduce tax rateson lawful gambling by 25 percent. Both bills were approved Feb. 17 by the Sales and Income Tax Division of the HouseTaxes Committee. The bills are identical for except for one If you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.15 February 20, 1998 / Daggett's bill ( HF3107 ) would Milbert's bill ( HF3024 ) would be retroactive to July 1, 1997. \"The money that is raised through lawful gambling is used back in communities for avariety of things,\" Milbert said. \"The moneyraised by lawful gambling stays in the commu-nity. This is a good tax to reduce. This moneydoes go back to pay for the schools.\" Daggett said that charitable gambling helps nonprofit organizations in her district pay forcharitable projects. \"When we need some funds, we have some- where we could go to, to get some consider-ation for our project,\" she said. Milbert cited one of the cities in his district, South St. Paul, which is home to the South St.Paul Educational Foundation. That organiza-tion raises money for scholarships and theSouth St. Paul Public Schools through chari-table gambling. \"It was set up and designed specifically to promote and support education,\" Milbert said. There are now more than 1,500 licensed organizations in the state, such as the LionsClub, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and theAmerican Legion, that use lawful gambling toraise money for community causes, includingcharities. Money is raised through the sale of pull- tabs, which account for 92.5 percent of chari-table gaming, and through bingo, paddlewheels, raffles, and tipboards. In combination, the games have raised more than $843 million in \"lawful purpose contri-butions,\" which include charitable and com-munity causes, since 1985. Organizations that run charitable gambling operations are taxed 2 percent of the revenuefrom pull-tabs and tipboards under currentlaw. Both bills would reduce that to1.5 percent. The tax on revenue gathered from bingo and other games is now 10 percent, but itwould drop to 7.5 percent under both bills. The bills call for the tax on combined re- ceipts between $500,000 and $700,000 to gofrom 2 percent to 1.5 percent. The tax oncombined receipts of $700,000 to $900,000would go from 4 percent to 3 percent and thetax on combined receipts of more than$900,000 annually would go from 6 percent to4.5 percent under both proposals. King Wilson, executive director of Allied Charities of Minnesota, said he believes it istime to give some money back to the chari-table organizations. \"We believe 1998 is theyear to come up with some [tax] relief,\" hesaid. If either bill is passed, the state would lose an estimated $15 million in gambling taxesannually.But, Wilson said, that money would be go- ing back to the organizations \"to be spent backin the communities for a variety of projects.\" Both bills now move to the full Taxes Com- mittee. Tax reductions, rebates Two bills the House is considering would reduce income taxes and property taxes andprovide for property tax rebates. HF2322 , sponsored by House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), andHF2325 , sponsored by Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth), were debated Feb. 16 by theProperty Tax and Tax Increment FinancingDivision of the House Taxes Committee. Both bills were referred to the full Taxes Committee without recommendation. Sviggum's bill calls for a permanent reduc- tion in taxes for low- and middle-incomepeople and provides a one-time rebate forproperty taxes paid in 1998 matching the oneapproved for property taxes paid in 1997. \"This bill seeks to deal with the $1.3 billion surplus. That surplus ought to be turned backto taxpayers,\" Sviggum said. The bill also would reduce property tax rates for some commercial and industrial prop-erty and apartment buildings with four ormore units. And the measure would cut thestatewide educational levy by $100 million infiscal years 2000 and 2001. Sviggum's bill would make $500 million available for the payment of property taxrebates. Van Dellen's bill would set priorities for using surplus revenue in state coffers. The billwould first devote a set amount of funds to thestate's budget reserve account and requireadditional surplus funds to go to an incometax reserve account that could be used only forincome tax rate reductions. Van Dellen's bill also would reduce prop- erty taxes for some commercial and industrialproperty and apartment buildings with fouror more units. The bill would provide incometax reductions and property tax rebates simi-lar to those called for in Sviggum's bill. Each bill would cost more than $800 mil- lion a year in tax revenue, according to stateestimates. Van Dellen said with the state looking at six straight years of a budget surplus, it's time fora permanent tax cut. \"People I speak with in the private sector, they think this is getting a little ridiculous,\" hesaid.Motor vehicle sales tax When school districts buy buses, they have to pay a motor vehicle sales tax, but somelawmakers are trying to change that. \"We come to government taxing govern- ment to transport children to school,\" saidMarty Seifert (R-Marshall). \"This money couldhave been saved for the schools, but insteadthat money went to St. Paul. This would [be]a small way of helping our school districts andhelping our taxpayers.\" Seifert is sponsoring a bill ( HF2911 ) that would exempt school buses with a capacity formore than 10 people from the state's motorvehicle sales tax. The bill was approved Feb. 17by the Sales and Income Tax Division of theHouse Taxes Committee. The bill would cost the state an estimated $3.2 million in tax revenue during fiscal year1999 and $6.7 million during the 2000-2001biennium. Smaller vehicles \u2014 such as vans, cars, and buses carrying fewer than 10 passengers \u2014would still be taxed under the bill. Rep. Gail Skare (DFL-Bemidji) said she thinks the bill is a good idea. \"The small districts that I know felt it was a great onus for them to pay motor vehicletaxes,\" she said. The bill now goes to the full Taxes Committee. TOURISM Repairing Glensheen A proposal to provide $750,000 for repairs at the Glensheen Mansion in Duluth was con-sidered by the Economic Development Fi-nance Division of the House EconomicDevelopment and International Trade Com-mittee Feb. 16. Glensheen Mansion was built in 1908 by mining executive Chester Congdon and hiswife, Clara. The 39-room mansion sits on a22-acre estate overlooking Lake Superior. In 1977, Glensheen was donated to the University of Minnesota-Duluth (UMD),which opened the historic facility to the pub-lic. UMD took over the mansion after aninfamous double murder took place involvingmembers of the Congdon family. The bill ( HF2974 ), sponsored by Rep. Tho- mas Huntley (DFL-Duluth), would authorizethe state to issue bonds for the amount of therepairs. The proceeds of these bonds would goto the Minnesota Historical Society, whichwould provide a grant to UMD. William Miller, an official from Glensheen of UMD, testified in support of the bill. He16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 20, 1998TRANSPORTATION Vehicle registration evasion Just because a motor vehicle on the high- way bears an Oregon license plate doesn'tmean the driver is here to explore Minnesota,said state trooper Brad Ferris. Ferris told the House Transportation and Transit Committee Feb. 18 that Oregonlicense plates cost just $10, and someMinnesota residents know how to get them. Many more Minnesota residents register their cars in North Dakota, South Dakota, orWisconsin, where licensing also is cheaperthan in Minnesota. He said registration eva-sion costs Minnesota $4.1 million to $21.7million annually. \"And I believe these figures are very conser- vative,\" Ferris said. HF2796 , sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), would establish a one-yeartask force of four state patrol members in theDepartment of Public Safety to investigatedealer fraud and registration evasion. The com-mittee approved the bill. Ferris said he counted 15 Wisconsin license plates during his drive from Mankato to thecommittee meeting in St. Paul. \"These people didn't look like they were on vacation, they looked like they were on theirway to work,\" he said. He detailed a typical traffic stop in which the driver of the vehicle had a Minnesotadriver's license and Wisconsin plates. \"She told me, 'All my friends do it.'\" Ferris said. And, he added, Minnesota was losing$275 in licensing fees on just that one car. Ferris said there were 4.7 million vehicles within Minnesota in 1996, and if just 1 percentwere illegally registered, it cost Minnesota atleast $2 million dollars. Ferris estimates that at least 5 percent of the cars sold privately never have the title properlytransferred. He put a minimum price tag of$1.2 million on that illegal practice.It is a gross misdemeanor for vehicles owned and operated in Minnesota to be registered inanother state. Violators also can be forced topay Minnesota registration for all precedingyears for which the state can prove evasion. The bill moves to the Transportation and Transit Finance Division. Making cars available Welfare reform measures that became ef- fective in recent months encourage work andset lifetime limits for receiving welfare checks.But many people moving off welfare couldfind it difficult to work without a car. Legislation moving to the House floor would exempt nonprofit organizations from obtain-ing a motor vehicle dealer's license for the saleor lease of cars and trucks valued at $1,000 orless. Such a move could make more vehiclesavailable for people \"with a demonstrated needfor assistance,\" according to Rep. Tim Pawlenty(R-Eagan). Pawlenty sponsors HF3028/SF2163* , which was approved by the House Transportationand Transit Committee Feb. 18. Pawlenty said certain organizations repair and recondition older cars that are donated tothem. These organizations then sell the ve-hicles at low prices to people moving off pub-lic assistance or to those with other needs. Expansion to four lanes Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) en- couraged members of the finance division ofthe House Transportation and Transit Com-mittee to drive on up and visit the Brainerdarea. \"But don't come on a Friday or a Sunday night,\" he said. At those times, the lake coun-try highway is often jammed with weekendtravelers. Wenzel appeared before the panel Feb. 13 to request $22 million in bonding revenue toexpand to four lanes Trunk Highway 371 be-tween Little Falls and Brainerd. Wenzel spon-sors HF3144 , which requests that the road construction project begin around July 1, 2000. No action was taken on the bill.Wenzel told the committee that there have been four fatalities on the 28-mile stretch ofroad in the past year. \"We've had promises from other governors to expand this to four lanes for over 30 years,\"he said. According to numbers from the Minnesota Department of Transportation, traffic doubledon stretches of Highway 371 from 1977 to1994. One section of 371 had a 4.6 fatality rateMemorial highway State trooper Dennis O'Brien wanted a last- ing memorial to his slain partner. He movedcloser to getting it Feb. 16 when the Housepassed HF2612 on a 128-0 vote. The bill calls for a stretch of Trunk Highway 95 to be designated in honor of Timothy Bowe,a Coon Rapids resident who, last year, becamethe first Minnesota state patrol officer to bekilled in the line of duty since 1978. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), a 14-mile stretch ofHighway 95 between NorthBranch would become \"Timothy J. BoweMemorial Highway.\" Bowe, 36, was shot to death last summer in Chisago County while answering a call abouta shooting at a rural home. Bowe, a 15-yearveteran, was the seventh Minnesota trooperever to be killed in the line of duty. \"His partner approached me about it,\" Jennings said. \"This was something we'd neverdone before, but after [O'Brien] came to me itseemed like it was a good idea and probablysomething that we should do in the future.\" Under the bill, the commissioner of trans- portation would adopt a suitable marking todesignate the highway and erect the signs,which would be paid for by the community ofCambridge. The bill now goes to the Senate.told the committee that the mansion averagesabout 100,000 visitors a year. Miller said that the bonding proposal is about maintaining state assets. \"Glensheen is owned by an institution of the state,\" he said, \"and we are trying to pre-serve it for future generations.\" HF2974 was approved for inclusion in the division's 1998 bonding recommendations.The measure likely will be considered for in-clusion in omnibus bonding legislation to beassembled later this session by the HouseCapital Investment Committee.per 100 million travelers between 1992 and 1996. The statewide fatality rate for a ruraltwo-lane road is 1.5 per 100 million travelers. Wenzel said construction to expand the highway has been tentatively set for 2003, buthis bill requests that construction begin threeyears earlier. There was little drama when Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) presented HF2390/ SF2031* before the House Judiciary Commit- tee Feb. 16. The bill would make mostly technical changes in the Uniform Limited PartnershipAct, which defines the way businesses canorganize for tax and liability purposes. As the noise level in the hearing room grew, Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), chair of thecommittee, gently rapped his gavel to remindattendees to keep quiet. \"These types of bills typically bring a lot of chatter in the background,\" Pugh said. \"It'stoo early in the day to sleep.\"17 February 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYIn 1912, Gov. Adolph O. Eberhart brought the leg-islature back in specialsession to create a directprimary process to nomi-nate candidates for state- wide office. He won re-election that year,becoming the first Minnesota governor tobe nominated in a primary election. In 1914, he became the first Minnesota governor unseated in a primary electionwhen he lost the Republican gubernatorialprimary. Two years later, he attempted apolitical comeback and lost the primaryelection for a U. S. Senate seat. Born under the name Adolph Olson, Eberhart immigrated to the United Statesfrom Sweden at age 11. As a teen, he workedas a cowboy in Nebraska. In 1891, he enrolled in Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn. Atthat time, he changed his last name toEberhart because the name Olson was toocommon at the school. After graduating, Eberhart moved to Mankato to practice law. In 1902, he waselected to the Minnesota Senate represent-ing Blue Earth County. The youngest mem-ber of the Senate at the time, Eberhartgained notoriety as an effective legislator.His track record included sponsorship oflegislation aimed at curbing the power ofthe railroads by increasing the state's abil-ity to regulate railway rates. When he completed his Senate term inPast governor creates statewide direct primary 1906, the Republican Party nominatedhim as its candidate for lieutenant gover-nor. He won the election and served forthree years under Democratic Gov. JohnA. Johnson. In 1909, Johnson died unex-pectedly, and Eberhart was sworn in asgovernor on Sept. 21. As governor, Eberhart continued many of the policies of the popular late gover-nor, including the creation of a state gov-ernment efficiency commission and thepassage of a workers' compensation law.But Eberhart's most notable accomplish-ment was the creation of the statewidedirect primary in 1912. The goal of the direct primary was to take the nominating process out of thehands of the political party elite and placeit in the hands of the people. Eberhart,however, may have preferred the directprimary for fear that his nomination at theparty convention could be jeopardized if other candidates teamed up against him.He won both the primary and generalelection in 1912. While party power had earlier domi- nated the nomination process, it soon be-came clear that issue politics would be thedominate force in the era of primary elec-tions. And in 1914, the issue was prohibi-tion William E. Lee, representing the \"dry\" Republican faction, challenged the incum-bent Eberhart in the 1914 Republican pri-mary. Lee, a former speaker of theMinnesota House of Representatives, ad-vocated county option, which would al-low each county to enact its ownprohibition laws. Eberhart preferred toleave the prohibition question up to lo-calities. Republican primary voters went dry and nominated Lee over Eberhart. In the gen-eral election, however, dry voters split theirvotes between Lee and a ProhibitionistParty candidate, and a Democratic andformer member of Congress namedWinfield S. Hammond was elected gover-nor. Eberhart later took one more swing at elective politics. After his 1916 primarydefeat to Frank B. Kellogg, who went on towin election to the U.S. Senate, Eberhartreturned to private life. He later moved toChicago and worked in the insurance andreal estate businesses. He died in 1944 atthe Masonic home in Savage, Minn. Photo from Men of Minnesota, R. L Polk & Co.Gov. Adolph O.

At the beginning of a legislative session, the pace of floor sessions is generally slow as newbills are assigned to committees and non-con-troversial items are discussed. At about thesession's midpoint, however, the legislative pacequickens. The House meets at 2:30 p.m. Mondays and Thursdays, and the Senate meets at 10 a.m.Mondays and at 8 a.m. Thursdays during thefirst few weeks. House floor sessions are sched-uled for the afternoon because committeesmeet in the morning and early afternoon. Asthe session nears the end, however, both bodieswill meet several times a week, often into thenight. All House and Senate floor sessions are open to the public. Visitors interested in observingthese sessions may call the House Chief Clerk'sOffice, (612) 296-2314, or Senate Information,(612) 296-0504, with questions. Spectators maysit in the galleries of either chamber.

When a public hearing is scheduled the com-mittee may listen to comments from the audi-ence (when time permits) in addition to thescheduled speakers. Committees have differ-ent policies on hearing testimony dependingupon their size and workload. Some commit-tees hear general testimony at the subcommit-tee level, while others allow general testimonyduring meetings of the full committee. Infor-mational handouts that committee membersreceive during meetings or hearings are con-sidered public information and are available tothe audience on a first-come, first-served basis.Major proposals on issues often have several public hearings so committee members maylisten to all arguments for and against a bill. Each committee has a chair, vice chair, administrator, and legislative assistant. A list ofcommittees and members is available in theHouse Public Information Office in Room175, State Office Building or the Senate Infor-mation Office in Room 231, State Capitol. Groups and individuals wishing to testify before a committee should call the appropriatecommittee's legislative assistant well in ad-vance of the meeting and ask to be placed onthe agenda. Committees prefer requests oneweek in advance but will accept later notifica-tion when unexpected issues appear on thecommittee schedule. A brochure containingtips on testifying at legislative committee hear-ings is available from the House Public Infor-mation Office. Dining All buildings in the Capitol complex have their own cafeterias. The Capitol and StateOffice Building cafeterias are in the basement.The Transportation and Centennial buildings'cafeterias are on the ground floor of each build-ing. The Judicial Center's cafeteria is on thefirst floor. The Veterans Service Building caf-eteria is on the fifth floor, and the CapitolSquare Building's dining area is on the lowerlevel. The Capitol also has a snack bar on thesecond floor (where the House and Senatechambers are located) during the session. TheCaf\u00e9 Minnesota is on the first level of theMinnesota History Center. All cafeterias servebreakfast and lunch. Group visits Sometimes groups plan a \"legislative day\" at the Capitol in order to express a particularviewpoint to legislators. Rooms for special conferences or speakers can be reserved by calling Sean Rahn, (612)296-5974, room scheduler for the State OfficeBuilding; or Nancy Bigelow, (612) 296-0866,room scheduler for the Capitol. If group members want to meet with their individual legislators or testify before a com-mittee (see \"Committee meetings\"), arrange-ments should be made at least a week in ad-vance. Often such groups have members wear a distinctive name tag or badge to indicate theirconcern about a particular issue.

Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) pro- posed that a bill ( HF3356 ) to classify white bears as protected animals Minnesota shouldalso protect \"any other white-striped, four-legged animal.\" Munger's idea confused some lawmakers.\"Is this a black animal with white stripes or a white animal with black stripes?\" Rep. BudNornes (R-Fergus Falls) inquired. But Munger continued to sing the praises of the animal he sought to protect. \"They're helpful to farmers because they eat grubs,\" Munger said of the unidentified ani-mal. Again, some lawmakers were confused.\"Zebras eat grubs?\" Rep. Peggy Leppik (R- Golden Valley) asked. The discussion stirred Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington) to recall a troubling per-sonal encounter with the creature in question. \"I've had one shot on my front porch in the rain,\" he said. \"After the excavation, we werefine.\" After all that, Munger withdrew his amend- ment. Skunks are \"misunderstood\" 1998 Members List as of January 28, 1998 Note: Room numbers are subject to change. *All rooms are in the State Office Building, St. Paul, MN 5515545A Abrams, Ron (R) ..........................................

Most of the effort is a \"behind the scenes operation.\" By the time legislators aredebating their bills or seeking information about why they should or should not vote ayeor nay, the preliminary work has already been put into place. While the partisan staff of the DFL caucus and the Republican caucus work diligently to get their specific session agendas into law, nonpartisan staff members are workingequally as hard to provide non-political support for staff and members. LegislativeReference Library staff also give much needed support and research for locating informa-tion or bill tracking. The average legislative employee's work may extend without overtime to some 50 to 60 hours per week or more. Legislative assistants, for example, work for two or threelawmakers, fielding their many phone calls, taking care of correspondence, keeping theircalendars up-to-date, and other clerical duties. Full-time pages serve as support for members and other staff from early morning to late evening when committees end or when session adjourns. They stay after session to cleanup the chamber and restore it back to its more formal setting. The sergeants in the department have supervisory and mail duties, and other sergeants are responsible for coordinating and supervising activities for some 50 interns or 12different high school juniors per week for 9 weeks. The Chief Clerk's Office staff continue to work for over two hours after session, even if adjournment is 8 p.m. or 2 a.m. When the House is not in session, visitors to thechamber will notice that at least one clerk is always on duty at the main desk. Some Revisor's Office, House Research Department, and Fiscal Analysis Department staff members actually remain at work for over 24 hours at a time when committee billdeadlines are pending or there is \"number crunching\" to be completed for some financebill. Caucus research, constituent services, media staff, and committee administrators all put in more than a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. work day. Other staff departments like bill duplicating,supply, administrative services, and television services also put in very long hours. House staff members are very dedicated and committed employees. They match the effort of lawmakers in making good government work. Staff members adhere strongly tothe last line noted on each of their job descriptions: \"Performs other duties and assumes other responsibilities as the need is apparent or delegated.\" \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Sandy Donovan Helping schools successfully implement the state's new graduation standards isthe main thrust of a $70 million educa- tion spending proposal advancing in theHouse. \"We're in year seven of our effort to develop statewide tests and standards,\" said Rep. BeckyKelso (DFL-Shakopee), chair of the K-12 Edu-cation Finance Division of the House Educa-tion Committee. \"I believe this year is a criticalyear. If we want this major effort to go ahead,we have to put some money out there.\" HF2874 , sponsored by Kelso, would give schools about $55 million in new funds nextyear to help implement the new standards.The House Education Committee approvedthe bill Feb. 24, and the legislation likely willbe debated on the House floor next week. Of the $63 per pupil targeted in the bill forK-12 education finance bill . . . Graduation rule implementation becomes top priority graduation rule implementation, more thanhalf \u2014$36 per student \u2014 would go directly toschools for teacher training. Teachers must begin teaching the new stan- dards \u2014 which incorporate more workadayskills and hands-on projects into traditionalacademic subjects \u2014 next fall, and many havetestified before lawmakers this session thatthey haven't had time or resources to prepare. Another $5 per student would go to dis-tricts for improving gifted and talented pro- grams that are integrated with the newstandards. The remaining dollars could be used by districts either for increasing technology re-lated to the new rule or for class-sizereductions. \"We realize this $27 per pupil will not be enough for big reductions, but we're recog-nizing that districts have differing needs,\" Kelsosaid. \"Some districts need staff developmentand need it immediately, and some do not.Some need new technology right away.\" The plan also calls for targeting $36 per student in future years for graduation stan-dards development. That money would godirectly to schools and could be used for stafftraining or class-size reduction. Graduation standards funding was not in- cluded in Gov. Arne Carlson's recommended $2 million K-12 education spending plan. Special education Although Kelso's bill targets only about $2.7 million for funding special education pro-grams, a pair of controversial policy provi-sions makes this area a big component of theomnibus proposal. The most hotly debated item would require the state to pay 50 percent of the legal costs ofschool districts who win in court against par- ents suing for special-education services. That provision comes in response to a 1997 report of the legislative auditor showing thatspecial education costs are spiraling and that alarge portion of those costs are court andattorney fees resulting from increasedlitigation. \"We're not looking at cutting services that schools already have, but it's undeniable thatthe cost of special education is increasing at arate that's unacceptable,\" Kelso said. \"I per-sonally think it's irresponsible not to deal withthose costs.\" But some lawmakers were concerned that having the state foot part of the districts' legalbills would send two negative messages: thatcourt is the appropriate venue for settlingproblems, and that the state does not supportparents who seek adequate services for theirchildren. In front of an audience spotted with \"Me- diation, not Litigation\" buttons, more than 25amendments were offered to the original pro-posal that called for the state to pay 70 percentof districts' court fees. The prevailing plan, from an amendment offered by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), em-phasizes mediation and says the state will con-tribute to legal fees only for districts that havemade a good-faith offer to parents and thenwon in court. Another sticking point in that portion of the bill is a provision that prohibits state spe-cial education requirements from exceedingfederal standards as of 1999. Exceptions wouldbe considered by the State Board ofEducation. That plan remained in the approved bill after a call to remove it by Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) failed. The bill also contains plans for maximizing Medical Assistance reimbursements for spe-cial education purposes, as well as $375,000for American Indian scholarships and othereducation-incentive programs. A comprehensive special education bill (HF2875 ), sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), was the source for the bulkof almost 40 pages of special education provi-sions in Kelso's bill. Greiling's bill grew out of Some legislators believe this is a critical year in the effort to implement graduation standards forMinnesota's students. A $70 million K-12 education bill currently advancing in the House would markfunds for teacher training and other expenses related to implementation of the new standards. Continued on page 44 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998 a joint House and Senate task force which met over the past year. The governor's recommended education spending plan included no special educationfunding for 1999. All-day kindergarten Kelso's bill also proposes spending an addi- tional $500,000 for certain schools to begin orcontinue all-day kindergarten programs. The new funds would bring next year's al- lowance for the first-grade preparedness pro-gram up to $5.5 million. Lawmakers on the K-12 Education Finance Division heard testimony citing several na-tional reports showing that attending all-daykindergarten dramatically increases students'academic and social skills. The provision comes from a bill ( HF2763 ) sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls)that originally aimed to implement all-daykindergarten statewide by 2004. Under thatplan, schools with the greatest number of stu-dents receiving free or reduced-price lunchwould have been eligible for funding first. Under the latest plan in HF2874 , any dis- trict that previously offered a full-day pro-gram can apply for funding. In-school suspension Lawmakers also included a plan in the om- nibus education bill to fund in-school suspen-sion programs. The provision would give schools $4 per day for each suspended student placed in anin-school or alternative program. The idea was originally proposed in a sepa- rate bill ( HF3664 ) sponsored by Rep. (DFL-St. said he wasconcerned that at-risk students become fur-ther disenfranchised when they are tempo-rarily barred from school, but that fundingproblems deter schools from setting up in-school alternatives. The extra money could be used to upgrade existing programs by adding licensed teachersand incorporating academic instruction. Boarding schools Although Kelso's bill doesn't financially support the governor's proposal for boardingschools for at-risk teens, an 11th-hour amend-ment by Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington)was approved, asserting support for the plan. Carlson's plan was reflected in a separate bill ( HF2321 ) sponsored by Seagren. The plan calls for $12 million to build three year-roundresidential academies. That money is currentlybeing considered for inclusion in an omnibusBy Matt Wetzel He's been a soldier, a teacher, a farmer, a legislator, and now, commissioner of theMinnesota Department of Agriculture(MDA) \u2014 a job with responsibilities asdiverse and varied as the career that's takenGene Hugoson to where he is now. \"A lot comes under the job criteria, [in- cluding] speaking out to the different agri-culture groups, going to Washington totestify on different agriculture issues,\" hesaid. \"Being in the Legislature is like driv-ing a car by committee. You get there at theend of the session. The system works, butit's a committee process. In this job, it'smuch easier for one person to have aninfluence.\" Besides overseeing more than 500 em- ployees, Hugoson promotes Minnesota-grown products and Minnesota farmers asactively as he can \u2014 on both the nationaland international levels. He also has theregulatory responsibility of any stateadministrative job. With the Department of Agricul- ture, that includes inspection andmonitoring of fertilizer plants, chemi-cal warehouses, grain elevators, dair-ies, and grocery stores to make surethe department is protecting publichealth and safety. While serving the House in 1995, Hugoson was approached by mem-bers of Gov. Arne Carlson's staff, whoasked if the fifth-term lawmakerwould be interested in taking the jobas commissioner. \"Having been at the Legislature, having worked in the AgricultureCommittee for the whole time, itseemed like a unique opportunity tomake a difference,\" he said. Hugoson, 52, is a native of Martin County in southwestern Minnesota. He still oper-ates the family farm, a 750-acre corn andsoybean operation near East Chain. He joins his wife, Patricia, and 18-year- old son, Jon, on weekends, but Hugosonlives in the Twin Cities during the week. He is a 1967 graduate of Augsburg Col- lege in Minneapolis with a degree in socialscience education, and he served in the U.S.Army for a two-year hitch, including a tourin Vietnam. Hugoson did graduate work at MankatoHugoson compares lawmakingwith being MDA commissioner State University, and he was a school teacherin Lakefield, Minn., and St. James, Minn.Running as a Republican, he won electionto the House in 1986 and was re-electedfour times. Besides the Agriculture Committee, he worked on the House Taxes Committeeand House Transportation and TransitCommittee. He also served four years asassistant minority leader. A major difference between being a com- missioner and a legislator is the variety, hesaid. \"As a legislator, you're expected to know a little about everything. You may be speak-ing to a veterans' group, senior citizens, orlocal government,\" he said. \"Here, it's vir-tually all agriculture, but there's a lot ofdiversity [in agriculture] in Minnesota.Suddenly, you learn about wheat and bar-ley, dairy, sugar beets, wild rice, canola. \"When I was a legislator, my constitu- ents consisted of 33,000 people. Now I work for the governor, and beyond that,everybody in the state of Minnesota.\" Hugoson does miss being in the Legisla- ture, if only a little. \"There's a camaraderie that develops in the Legislature,\" he said. \"There's a lot ofinteraction that you expect when you're insession. The camaraderie is similar to whatyou've got in the military \u2014 being awayfrom your family during the week, notbeing around them during the session.\" Gene Hugoson, state commissioner of agriculture,has been a teacher, a farmer, and a legislator. He saidhis latest job presents a new set of challenges andopportunities. Continued on page 19Continued from page 35 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 19 - 26, 1998 BANKING BUDGETWomen and credit history A bill that would address the credit con- cerns of divorced women and widows who aredenied loans or credit cards because they don'thave an individual credit history was passedby the House Feb. 23. The vote was 128-0. HF2309 , sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), would attempt to rectifythe credit problems experienced by manywomen by requiring that creditors report acredit history in the name of both spouses. The requirement would include joint ac- counts and individual accounts under thename of the applicant's spouse or formerspouse. The bill makes clear that lenders candeny credit cards to applicants who are deemeda bad risk. The bill goes to the Senate. Martin Luther King Jr. Day Lester Collins, executive director of the Minnesota Council on Black Minnesotans,told a House committee events that happenedduring this year's Martin Luther King Jr. Dayshow the need for education on racial toler-ance. He was referring to two racially motivated attacks that occurred in Minnesota Jan. 19,one in St. Paul and one in Brooklyn Center. Nonetheless, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should remind all of us of King's im-portant message of racial equality, Collins said. \"We believe that the King celebration should be an everyday event, culminating on theJan. 19 holiday,\" he said. Collins testified before the Economic De- velopment Finance Division of the House Eco-nomic Development and International TradeCommittee Feb. 24 in support of a bill to fundthe commission which plans statewide MartinLuther King Day events. HF3741 , sponsored by Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley), would allocate$195,000 over a two-year period to eventsand publicity. The committee approved a one-year appro- priation of $75,000 for the King Day commis-sion in its omnibus economic developmentfunding recommendations. Those recommen- dations have been approved by the full com-mittee and are headed to the House Ways andMeans Committee. BUSINESSCRIME Business on Sundays Sunday snowmobile sales are a logistical nightmare for Minnesota dealers. It's perfectly legal to sell boats, snowmo- biles, and all-terrain vehicles on Sunday. Butboat, vehicle trail- ers are considered \"motor vehicles,\" and the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday is prohibitedby state law. The House passed a bill Feb. 23 that aims to fix this glitch in the law. The vote was 132-0. Sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), the bill would exempt boat, snowmo-bile, and all-terrain vehicle trailers from theSunday sales ban. \"This is something we should have done a long time ago,\" Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) said during a Feb. 17 House Com-merce, Tourism and Consumer AffairsCommittee hearing on the matter.A separate provision in the bill also aims to make life easier for trailer dealers. Under current law, an individual must have a franchise license to sell a motor vehicle. Thebill would exempt trailers from the franchiserequirement. Anderson was first alerted to the problems with trailer sales by a small marine dealer inhis district. Originally, Anderson said, he con-sidered doing away with the Sunday motorvehicle sales ban entirely. That idea opened a \"hornet's nest,\" he said. Some dealers support Sunday sales; many donot. At the Feb. 17 hearing, Scott Lambert of the Minnesota Auto Dealers Association, said thathis organization has no problem with exempt-ing trailers from the Sunday sales ban, how-ever, the automobile dealers Lambertrepresents are not interested in doing regularbusiness on Sundays. The bill ( HF2425/SF2170* ) now goes to the governor. Omnibus crime prevention bill Discussion on the 1998 omnibus crime pre- vention and judiciary finance bill has revolvedaround one issue: the cost of getting tough oncrime. The bill ( SF3345 ), sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Rep. WesSkoglund (DFL-Mpls), represents a good dealof the work done this session by the HouseJudiciary Committee and its finance division.The bill was approved by both panels Feb. 25and now goes to the House Ways and MeansCommittee. The final debate in the full Judiciary Com- mittee centered on reports received from theDepartment of Corrections and the Sentenc-ing Guidelines Commission on the potentialeffects on prison bed counts. The Department of Corrections predicts that with the policy decisions contained in theomnibus crime bill the state could have to payas much as $19.4 million over the next threeyears for additional prison beds. The department's figures are based on the fact that toughening penalties for certaincrimes means that prisoners will stay in prisonfor longer periods of time, costing the statemore money.Lester Collins, executive director of the Council onBlack Minnesotans, testifies before the EconomicDevelopment Finance Division of the HouseEconomic Development and International TradeCommittee Feb. 24. He supported a bill to fund thecouncil, which plans statewide Martin Luther KingDay events.6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998Much of the debate focused on one of the more controversial provisions in the bill, theso-called \"three strikes\" provision. The provision, backed by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), would require life impris-onment for criminals convicted of three vio-lent felony-level crimes. The provision alsoincludes language for judicial discretion inapplying the new sentence requirements. The Sentencing Guidelines Commission predicts that this provision alone could meanan additional 664 prison beds would be neededover the next 34 years. The members of the committee debated the need for tougher penalties versus the need forfiscal considerations. After the debate, thecommittee approved the omnibus bill with-out any substantial changes. Here are some of the highlights of the omnibus crime prevention bill. Getting tough The omnibus crime prevention bill includes several provisions aimed at lengthening pen-alties for certain crimes. In addition to the \"three strikes\" provision, the bill also has a provision that also wouldaddress repeat violent offenders. The provision, which comes from a sepa- rate bill sponsored by Skoglund, would re-structure current law that requires tougherpenalties for \"career criminals\" and wouldreduce the number of violent crimes requiredto receive these harsher sentences. Another provision in the bill increases the penalties for engaging in prostitution in aschool zone or in a residential area. The pro-visions apply to all involved in the illegaltransaction. A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee Feb. 25 would provide increased penalties for anumber of crimes, including prostitution, repeat violent offenses, and drive-by shootings. The bill nowgoes to the House Ways and Means Committee. Penalties also would be increased for the crime of witness tampering, for failure to ap-pear in court if charged with a felony-levelcrime, and for felons who are found illegally inpossession of a firearm. Fighting drugs The omnibus bill would increase the penal- ties for manufacturing, possessing, or sellingmethamphetamine. Law enforcement officialssaid that this drug is seeing a dramatic increasein use in Minnesota. The bill would raise the drug to the same status as cocaine and heroin and would makethe manufacture of any amount methamphet-amine a first-degree controlled substanceoffense. The bill also makes the drug ephedrine a controlled substance, to be dispensed only byprescription in most instances. The targetedover-the-counter products containing ephe-drine are reportedly taken by teenagers andothers looking to achieve a legal high. Drive-by shootings A provision in the omnibus bill makes mur- der committed during a drive-by shooting afirst-degree murder crime, increasing theprison sentence for the offense. The crime bill would also raise the maxi- mum penalty from a five-year prison term toa 20-year term for firing into an occupiedvehicle. Conditional release The omnibus bill would make several changes to the state's probation and condi-tional release law. Most notably, the bill wouldrequire that each convicted felon released onprobation carry a card that would have the terms of the individual's release. The person on conditional release would be required to produce the card when requestedby a police or probation officer, which wouldallow the officer to know if the parolee isviolating the terms of his or her parole. Juvenile criminals The omnibus crime bill would also open some juvenile court records and proceedingsto the public. For juveniles under 14 years old, the bill would make court records available to thepublic if the juvenile is found guilty of a thirdfelony or gross misdemeanor level offense. For juveniles who are 14 years old or older, the bill would open all court hearings to thepublic, regardless of the offense. The recordswould be closed to the public when the juve-nile turns 21. The bill also would make it easier to get juveniles who are participating in prostitutioninto the state's child protection system. Financing justice The bill contains $7.3 million in supple- mental appropriations, a majority of which goto the Department of Corrections, the De-partment of Public Safety, and the state courts. The Department of Corrections would re- ceive $2.8 million, much of which would go toreducing the caseload for probation officers.Grant programs which fund community cor-rections would also be funded through thesedollars. The Department of Public Safety would be appropriated $1.8 million. Of these funds, theoffice of the Crime Victim Ombudsman wouldreceive $125,000 to fund its services; the Bu-reau of Criminal Apprehension would receive$133,000 to add forensic scientists to its crimelab; and the department would get $300,000for law enforcement and community crimeprevention grants. The bill would appropriate $1.3 million to the state courts for law clerk salaries. The statepublic defender would receive $451,000 fordefense attorney salaries. Another $500,000would be given to Legal Aid to provide legalservice to low-income individuals. 'Burglary' definition expanded Minneapolis resident Loretta Chosa's house has been broken into three times. And al-though she can identify the people involved,police have told her that they cannot pros-ecute. \"The house was just trashed,\" she said. \"Ev- erything I own was stolen, including my kids'clothes and toys.\" Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) said that such7 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYDEVELOPMENT Economic development funding The omnibus economic development finance bill cleared its first two hurdles Feb.25, gaining approval from two House panels. HF3806 was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, which should be thebill's last stop before going to the House floor. Sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), the bill combines many of the eco-nomic development initiatives heard in theEconomic Development Finance Division ofthe House Economic Development and Inter-national Trade Committee. The division andthe full committee approved the bill. The $15 million appropriations package, containing supplemental budget additions forseveral state agencies, would fund new projectsand existing programs statewide. The bill alsocontains some policy provisions. The largest appropriation contained in the bill would go to the Minnesota Film Board toprovide support for the state's $250 millionfilm and video industry. The $5 million ap-propriation, which was part of the governor'ssupplemental budget recommendations,would create a revolving loan film fund to beadministered by the film board and the De-partment of Trade and Economic Develop-ment. The fund would provide loans ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 to film and televisionproducers for Minnesota projects. The stateloan funds could account for up to 50 percentof the production budget. The loan agreementwould require the producer to spend 120 per- cent of the loan amount in the state. The film board expects that 20 projects will be initiated in the state during the first fewyears of the program. Currently, eight na-tional cable television series are produced inthe state, and 55 feature films have been madein Minnesota since 1990, according to theboard. Here are some other highlights of the omnibus bill. Economic development Including the aforementioned film board appropriation, funding for the Department ofTrade and Economic Development \u2014 a totalof $7.7 million \u2014 makes up half of the spend-ing called for in the entire bill. The department would receive $1 million in additional funding for the Office of Tourism.Part of the governor's request, the moneywould be used to supplement advertising toattract tourists to Minnesota. Of this amount,the bill would earmark $50,000 for marketingthe Heritage Halls Museum and MinnesotaAviation Hall of Fame in Owatonna, Minn.,and $50,000 for a feasibility study of a pro-posed \"great rivers of the world aquarium\" inSt. Paul. The bill would provide $300,000 to fund a taconite mining grant program through thedepartment. The grants are awarded to taco-nite mining companies to research and de-velop ways to improve mining and processingtechniques. The city of St. Paul would receive a $350,000 grant to make improvements on the Univer-sity of Minnesota Centennial Showboat dockedat Harriet Island. The grant also would be usedto study options for relocation and expansionof the St. Paul Farmers' Market. The bill also would allocate $285,000 for the development of a trolley service which wouldconnect the Minneapolis Convention Centerand downtown Minneapolis with culturaltourist attractions in south Minneapolis neigh-borhoods. Other statewide development initiatives include $200,000 to provide improvements tothe Fairmont Opera House and $200,000 tothe Duluth Technology Center. Boosting employment Under the omnibus bill, the Department of Economic Security would receive $5 millionto fund job training and re-employmentprograms. The department would acquire $250,000 to develop programs that encourage women tohold nontraditional occupations. The agencywould develop programs to educate and trainwomen for technical careers that, historically, have not been open to them. The Department of Economic Security would receive $1.4 million targeted at jobtraining for youth. Of these funds, $600,000would go to summer youth employment pro-grams, and $250,000 would be used to developa pilot project aimed at linking workforcetraining centers with four secondary schools. The department also would receive $1 mil- lion for their rehabilitative services, whichprovide job training to people withdisabilities. The bill also would appropriate $1.4 mil- lion to the State Services for the Blind todevelop a digital communication center for itsRadio Talking Book program. The programbroadcasts literature over special radio fre-quencies that can be accessed by specialreceivers. The Centers for Independent Living would receive $523,000 to assist a current grant pro-gram that provides support facilities designedand operated by persons with disabilities. The bill also would provide $126,000 to the organization Advocating Change Together Inc.for employment training for people with de-velopmental and other mental healthdisabilities. History and tourism The omnibus bill would appropriate $1 million to the Minnesota Historical Societyand $735,000 to the Department of Adminis-tration to fund a wide range of projects state-wide. Of these funds, $300,000 would go to fi- nance the development of a conference centerin Little Falls, $185,000 would fund improve-ments to Montevideo's historic railroad de-pot, and $100,000 would finance rehabilitationon the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroadoutside of Duluth. Healthy homes The most controversial policy provision of the bill was removed by the full EconomicDevelopment and International Trade Com-mittee before the panel approved the legisla-tion. Part of what was originally termed the \"healthy homes bill,\" the provision called forall new homes built after March 1, 1999, tohave a mechanical ventilation system. Opponents of the provision argued that it put undue burden on the building industry,which is already responding to consumer con-cerns regarding home safety. Other provisions of the original \"healthy homes bill\" remain in the omnibus bill, in-cluding a proposal to increase new home war-cases occur frequently in her district and that police are telling the victims they cannot doanything about it. The victims are often toldthat it is difficult to prove whether or not aperson found in the home actually broke intothe home. \"They are told, 'Well, too bad. Maybe we could charge on a misdemeanor trespass,maybe not,'\" Clark said. \"In each case, therewere thousands of dollars in damage. Peoplewere thrown out of their homes. These placeswere trashed.\" Clark backed a provision in the bill that would make it easier to prosecute people whoillegally enter a property by expanding thedefinition of burglary to include accomplices. She told the committee that prosecutors believe the new language would make the lawmore explicit and allow them to bring chargesagainst anyone who illegally enters a dwelling,even if they don't actually break in or stealsomething.8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998 ranty periods that give homeowners time to find out about defective conditions and toseek legal action. Employment contracts The omnibus bill also includes compromise language from a bill that initially called for allemployers to disclose the terms of employ-ment in writing in each employee's firstlanguage. The current bill would require only that the Department of Labor and Industry develop abrochure stating employee rights and listingemployee resource phone numbers. The provision also would require employ- ers to provide the brochure when an employeeis first offered a job, and the bill would providepenalties for employers who fail to do so. House pages Kelly Jo Tungland, left, Nancy Tracy, center , and Dianne Lee take a break to enjoy the unseasonably warm Capitol Hill weather, compliments of El Ni\u00f1o Feb. 24. The mercury rose to a near-record 54 degrees, making the snowless landscape look like spring.One fine dayFAMILY Family and early education Minnesota's families would receive $2.2 million in state dollars under the family andearly childhood education spending bill passedby the House Feb. 26. The $2.2 million bill ( HF2803/SF2532* ) was produced by the Family and Early Child- hood Education Division of the House Educa- tion Committee. Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-ParkRapids) is sponsoring the funding package. \"The purpose of this bill is to expand the supply of child care in our state and improveits quality,\" Kinkel said.The bill passed on a 91-42 vote. It now goes to the governor. Here's a look at major provisions of the legislation. Investing in families A proposal that would allow low-income families to contribute money to a \"family assetaccount\" and receive matching dollars fromthe state or a private organization would re-ceive $875,000. The aim of the program would be to help low-income families move out of poverty byattaining certain important economic goals. State or private matching funds would be kept in a separate account, and the familywould not get the money until they have fin-ished an economic literacy course and achievedtheir goals for one of three approved purposes\u2014 buying a home, paying for an education, orstarting a business. Other states are considering such programs, and similar legislation is pending in Congress. The program would be administered by the Department of Children, Families, andLearning. Helping the homeless The Department of Children, Families, and Learning estimates that there are 21,000 home-less children in Minnesota. A recent Univer-sity of Minnesota study found that 25 percentof homeless children are at least three yearsbehind in school. In Minneapolis, 10 percentof the elementary-aged students are homelesseach year. Sue Watlov-Phillips, of Elim TransitionalHousing, brought these figures on homelessness to the Family and Early Child-hood Education Division of the House Educa-tion Committee Feb. 9. \"The greatest predictor of homelessness as an adult is unstable housing as a child,\" Watlov-Phillips said. \"If we invest now, we can make asignificant difference.\" The spending bill would appropriate $626,000 for emergency services and sheltersand transitional housing for the homeless. Under federal Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, housing isconsidered affordable if it costs no more than30 percent of a household's income. In Minnesota, 350,000 households are paying more than 30 percent of their income for hous-ing, Watlov-Phillips said. \"That means they'reone paycheck away from homelessness.\" Gang prevention The bill would appropriate $225,000 for gang prevention and intervention. The funding would be available for local organizations to reach children and youngadults who are either at risk for criminal ganginvolvement or who have expressed interest interminating their gang affiliation. After-school activities, job skill training, and counseling are among the services thatwould be offered to the young people. Child guides Students in Willmar, Minn., who have ex- hibited low self-esteem or anti-social behav-ior have a network of people watching out forthem.9 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYThe Child Guide Program serves as a link between at-risk students in kindergartenthrough eighth grade and adult volunteermentors. The bill would appropriate $225,000 to ex- pand the successful program to other sitesaround the state. The Willmar program receives students re- ferred by watchful teachers, parents, or com-munity volunteers and matches the youthswith mentors who take on the task of redirect-ing the child's focus toward positive activitiessuch as music lessons, sports, or scouts. Nearly 200 volunteers and close to 80 local businesses, organizations, and agencies in theWillmar area are currently active in the ChildGuide Program. Lead contamination Lead poisoning is the top environmental health problem for children, Rep. Karen Clark(DFL-Mpls) told the Family and Early Child-hood Education Division Feb. 16. The bill would appropriate $150,000 for nonprofit organizations to clean up lead-con-taminated residential sites around the state. Calling for help People in need of emergency shelter, legal aid, or medical care often have no idea how toget in touch with service providers. \"If you can't find a service, it's as if it never existed,\" Krista Boston, of First Call for Help,told the Family and Early Childhood Educa-tion Division during a Feb. 16 hearing. First Call For Help is a social services infor- mation and referral telephone hotline thatwas developed 50 years ago by the United Wayof Minneapolis. In 1997, the program received 350,000 calls \u2014 a 20 percent increase over 1996. The bill would appropriate $100,000 to ex- pand First Call for Help into \"First Call Min-nesota,\" a statewide computer system databaseof health services, social services, educationalprograms, housing information, and employ-ment services. Child care The bill also would transfer $5 million in federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Fami-lies (TANF) funds to the Department of Chil-dren, Families, and Learning for several childcare projects. Among the provisions is a plan to make available more nonstandard hour child care.The number of parents seeking child careduring evening and overnight shifts is pro-jected to increase dramatically with new wel-fare reforms. Under the bill, $1 million would be appro-priated to establish a nonstandard-hours child care pilot project. The department would set up a grant pro- gram for child care operations that providecare during these nonstandard working hoursfor start-up assistance, training, and businesssupport. New providers of nonstandard-hour child care would be eligible to receive a guaranteedsubsidy for up to one year. Funds also would be targeted to improve the quality of child care. Many child carecenters struggle with high employee turnoverrates. The child care industry considers lowwages to be the biggest reason for high turn-over in the field. The bill would include $1.1 million for child care quality improvement grants to providersfor training and staff retention incentives. Loan Forgiveness The TANF money also would be used for a loan forgiveness program for child careworkers. Child care aides in Minnesota earn an aver- age wage of $5 to $5.99 an hour, NancyJohnson, of Child Care Works, told the Familyand Early Childhood Education Division dur-ing a Feb. 4 hearing. It is nearly impossible for child care workers to afford continuing education or pay backstudent loans. The bill would direct $300,000 to the educa- tion loan forgiveness grant program. GOVERNMENT State government finance bill The Office of the Attorney General would receive the bulk of funds in a $30 million stategovernment finance bill approved Feb. 26 bythe House Governmental OperationsCommittee. The state's top legal and law enforcement agency would receive $24 million for 1999operating expenses under HF3137 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia). That's $400,000 less than the attorney gen- eral would have received had Gov. ArneCarlson not used his line-item veto authorityin 1997 to strike the office's proposed fundingfor this year. And although Carlson reinstated $22.5 mil- lion in his proposed supplemental budget thisyear, the office requested the original $24.4million from lawmakers, citing increasedworkloads and expenses. The office is responsible for asserting and defending the state's legal interests, settlingclaims involving the public and private sec- tors, and aiding other law enforcement agen-cies in prosecuting and solving cases. At the time of his veto, Carlson cited \"un- necessary, imprudent, and unacceptablegrowth\" in the department. But Lee Sheehy, chief deputy attorney gen- eral, told lawmakers this year that not onlydoes the office pay its own way through legaldamages and other recovered funds returnedto the state, but lawyers in the office earnsubstantially less than their private-sectorcounterparts. Also, Deputy Attorney General Margaret Chutich said, the office increasingly has toturn down requests for help from county at-torneys because of staff shortages. The department's 1999 proposed budget was divided into three categories: $13.6 forlaw enforcement, $2.2 for agency representa-tion, and $8.7 million for defense and pros-ecution of civil claims. The bill includes a call for a task force to evaluate, by 1999, the availability, effective-ness, and cost of legal services provided by theoffice. State administration After the allowance to the Office of the Attorney General, most of the remaining fundsin the omnibus bill would go to finance vari-ous Department of Administration programs. The largest chunk, $3.85 million, would be used to help update state computer systems toaddress problems associated with the adventof the year 2000. Several technology grants also would origi- nate from this department, under the bill. Public television stations would be eligible to share $500,000 in grants to help them con-vert to a digital broadcasting signal, as man-dated by the federal government. Also, $315,000 would be earmarked for a grant to Pioneer Public Television to build atower in Otter Tail County. That area is cur-rently the only part of the state that cannotreceive a public television signal. Another provision would allow Minneapo- lis and St. Paul to share a grant of $100,000 todevelop computer facilities in public parks. That provision grew out of a proposal by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), who said thatbecause of unique busing situations in hercity, parks have replaced schools as commu-nity centerpieces and would be the appropri-ate place to provide low-income residents withInternet access. An amendment by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL- St. Paul) secured his city's right to share thegrant.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998Community-based planning A controversial plan to expand a state advi- sory council on community-based planninghas, so far, withstood several attempts to re-move it from the omnibus bill. The plan was originally proposed in a sepa- rate bill ( HF3609 ) sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls). It would expand member-ship on an existing advisory council as well asextend the life of the council for a year and ahalf, until December 1999. It would not pro-vide additional funding for the council. The council's purpose is to set up voluntary land-use planning projects between state andlocal government units. But many Greater Minnesota lawmakers say that idea scares them for one reason: Theydon't believe land-use planning will remainvoluntary for long. \"Sure, now it's voluntary, but we've heard that with every other project that soon becamemandatory,\" said Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-LakeCity). \"[Voting against this bill] is the oppor-tunity to kill this monster while it's young,before it grows horns.\" And although opponents numbered too few to strike the proposal, Long told them shewould support language, if brought up whenthe bill is heard before the full House, to sunsetthe council if the projects ever cease to bevoluntary. Governor's portrait Last year the governor used his line-item veto authority to strike a project that wouldhave included installing his portrait in theCapitol, but lawmakers reinserted the portraitplan in this year's finance bill. The bill calls for $20,000 to be included in the Department of Administration's 1999budget for the project. When Carlson vetoed the project last year, it was included in an appropriation to theCapitol Area Architectural and PlanningBoard. At the time, Carlson rejected the entireappropriation, saying some other proposedprojects did not meet guidelines adopted bythe board in 1991. Canadian diplomacy Rukavina'a bill also would provide money for Minnesota lawmakers to meet with Cana-dian officials and attempt to resolve some on-going border disputes. The disputes center mostly on border waters and involve such fishing issues as howmany walleyes Minnesotans are allowed tocatch in and bring home from Canadianwaters. The bill calls for a $25,000 grant to the Council of State Governments to set up meet-ings between Minnesota legislators and mem- bers of the Manitoba and Ontario parliaments. The plan was originally proposed in an- other bill ( HF3450 ), sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls). No more baseball Saying they were sick and tired of baseball- related issues, lawmakers struck a six-line sec-tion from the omnibus bill that would haveprohibited the Metropolitan Sports FacilitiesCommission from signing any future leasewith a professional baseball team for less thanseven years. Kahn supported the proposal, saying it would send a message to Major League Base-ball. \"When the Twins canceled their lease early, they threw a hardball into the process,\" shesaid. \"We're picking up that hardball and send-ing it back to them.\" But a successful amendment by Osthoff removed any mention of baseball from theomnibus bill. HIGHER EDUCATION Omnibus higher education bill A seemingly small provision in the House's omnibus higher education funding bill mightbe noticed the most by Minnesota parentswith postsecondary education plans for theirchildren. This year's $82 million bill omnibus bill (SF3297 ) includes a measure that would allow parents of 1998 high school graduates to claiman income tax credit of up to $500 toward thecost of the student's first year of collegetuition. The House approved the bill Feb. 26 on a 104-26 vote. The bill, sponsored by Rep. GenePelowski, Jr. (DFL-Winona), now goes to theSenate. Coupled with a new $1,500 federal income tax credit, the House proposal \u2014 originallyproposed by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crys-tal) and dubbed the \"grade proposal \u2014would make postsecondary education moreaffordable for most Minnesotans. It is estimated that the tax credit would result in a revenue loss of about $7 million tothe state. The omnibus bill also calls for $39 million in spending for the Minnesota State Collegeand University (MnSCU) system and $38.5for the University of Minnesota. Another $3 million would be appropriated to increase by $500 the private college tuitioncap. Every other year the Legislature sets themoney allocated to calculate state grants. Theallocation in the bill would raise the cap for each grant to $8,550. Grade 13 Families of 1998 high school graduates headed immediately to college and with anannual income with certain limits would beable to deduct $500 when they file their stateincome 1998 tax return, under the bill. The federal government recently established the Hope Scholarship Credit, which calls for a$1,500 credit for those who come under thesame income guidelines. The total of $2,000 in state and federal tax credits would cover the first-year tuition formany state universities and colleges, whichbill supporters say would make an additionalyear of school \u2014 or grade 13 \u2014 available tomost Minnesotans. Single parents could earn up to $40,000 for the full state credit, with total phase out at$50,000 for single filers. Married couples couldearn up to $80,000 per year for the full amount,with the credit phased out at $100,000 inannual income. The bill was amended to include indepen- dent students who file income tax returns, butthere is a catch. Student taxpayers would needto earn about $7,000 annually before theywould begin to realize a tax liability. To be eligible for the tax credit, students would have to attend a Minnesota two- orfour-year college, a technical college, or an-other in-state trade training program. Under the legislation, the one-time credit could be claimed for the tuition and relatededucation expenses of each student in ataxpayer's family. MnSCU money Earlier this session, Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL- St. Cloud) told the Higher Education FinanceDivision of the House Education Committeethat Minnesota spends more per student atsome two-year higher education facilities thanit does at four-year universities. Opatz also indicated significant disparities exist in the amount of money the state's insti-tutions receive per full-time equivalentstudent. He noted, for example, the state, in effect, provides Southwest State University with about$2,000 more per student than Mankato StateUniversity. He said the variance between the highest and lowest funded state universities for fiscalyear 1998 is 54 percent, and disparity amongtwo-year schools is 90 percent. The omnibus legislation would provide $21.5 million for fiscal year 1999 in fundingequalization, which is $9.5 million more than11 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY MnSCU or the governor requested. This fund- ing would be to reduce the variations in per-student funding among the MnSCUinstitutions. MnSCU was created in the 1995 merger of Minnesota's technical and community col-leges and state universities. MnSCU has 36campuses in the state. As part of that appropriation, the Legisla- ture would ask MnSCU to develop an alloca-tion model beginning in fiscal year 2000. Pelowski, the finance division chair, told the House Ways and Means Committee onFeb. 25 the bill is framed to keep the Legisla-ture from writing the system's model. It was 1997 legislation that resulted in fund- ing at two-year campuses exceeding that ofstate universities. \"We have tried to create a balance, but we also created some problems,\" Pelowski said.\"This is to give direction, but not to write theirformula for them. They will come back to uswith a formula.\" The governor and MnSCU requested no money for the acquisition of library materialsand equipment, but the House bill includes $3million for such items. Pelowski said legislators thought MnSCU \"grossly underestimated and underfunded\"this area. Pelowski also said these librarieshave become resource centers for the regionsthey serve, and not just the students, and thefunds would help the libraries meet these needs. University of Minnesota U of M President Mark Yudof has focused on investing in the school's molecular andcellular biology initiatives. The school intendsto create an institute for molecular and cellu-lar biology with the aim of pushing the schoolinto the top five public universities in biologi-cal sciences. About 70 percent of all research expendi- tures at the U of M are for biology, includingmedicine and agriculture. The biggest part ofYudof's capital budget request a month agowas $70 million for a molecular and cellularbiology institute. In his supplemental budget request, Yudof asked for funding to recruit 11 blue-chip fac-ulty members during the next three years, andto provide them with the expensive equip-ment needed for their research. The bill pro-vides some funds for that equipment fund andto hire research assistants. Yudof also intends to hire another 15 jun- ior faculty by redirecting current universityfunds. Both the university and the governor re- quested $22 million to fund the ongoing ini-tiatives. The House bill would set funding for Left to right : Elliot Dash, Tonilyn Hornung, Amy Silverman, Scott Duff, and Mark Hefti as Mr. Bill play the cartoon characters of the television series, Schoolhouse Rock. Legislators were invited to the Feb. 20 Capitol performance, which combined history, grammar, math, and science.Schoolhouse Rocksuch items at $24.5 million for fiscalyear 1999. The university and the governor also asked for $19.5 million in one-time projects. The billincludes $13.75 million for this area. Regent elections The bill stipulates a change in the Univer- sity of Minnesota regent election process bysetting a residency requirement. The change isthe result of a joint House and Senate commit-tee to have the board reflect various parts ofthe state. At least five regents would have to live in the seven-county metropolitan area and at leastfive would live outside that metropolitan area,under the bill. Candidates currently are se-lected from each of Minnesota's eight con-gressional districts. The bill would also change the Regent Can- didate Advisory Council from 24 to 15 mem-bers. The council recruits, interviews, andrecommends to the Legislature candidates forthe U of M Board of Regents. Under the current law, the speaker of the House selects 12 members and a Senate sub-committee selects the other 12. The legislationwould have the speaker and Senate subcom-mittee pick four each. The House and Senateminority leaders would each pick two, and thegovernor would pick three. Currently, the advisory council can recom- mend between two and four candidates foreach vacancy. That would change to two can-didates under the legislation.Legal helpers Second- and third-year law students at the University of Minnesota represent roughly700 low-income Minnesotans annually in cam-pus law clinics. There are 16 divisions in theclinic concentrating in areas such as civil cases,bankruptcy, and domestic issues. The U of M would receive an additional $250,000 to supplement its current fundingfor the legal program, which is now fundedfrom tuition, private contributions, and fed-eral and state grants. The legislation would allow the clinic to increase the number of students and facultywho participate and allow them to serviceanother 200 clients. HOUSING Omnibus housing bill A provision that would provide $10 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency(MHFA) to assist in maintaining existing low-income housing is the centerpiece of the om-nibus housing bill approved Feb. 25 by twoHouse panels. HF2342 , sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), was approved by Housing andHousing Finance Division and the full HouseEconomic Development and InternationalTrade Committee on the same day. The billnow goes to the House Ways and MeansCommittee.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998HUMAN SERVICESThe omnibus bill contains many of the hous- ing bills that were heard by the Housing andHousing Finance Division this session and$15 million in total appropriations for pro-grams administered by the MHFA. The proposed $10 million appropriation to protect existing affordable housing was workedon by legislators during the interim and wasincorporated into the governor's budgetrecommendations. The provision comes inresponse to a situation occurring statewide. In the 1970s, the federal government set up a program through which developers receivedreduced-rate mortgages and financing incen-tives to build low- and moderate-income hous-ing. Rent rates were subsidized by the federalgovernment and rent increases were regu-lated. Owners of many such complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allowsthem to prepay the remaining portion of theirmortgage and to begin charging market-raterent. Housing advocates say that this scenario could happen at the more than 300 apartmentcomplexes throughout the state that were fi-nanced through the federal program. The owners of 215 Oak Grove in Minne- apolis, Hopkins Village in Hopkins, KnoxLanding in Bloomington, and Grand Pre Bythe Park and Selby-Dayton in St. Paul have allannounced that they plan to take advantage ofthe prepayment option. The $10 million in Clark's bill would fund the equity takeout loan program adminis-tered by the MHFA. The fund is used to pro-vide financial incentives to maintain existingsubsidized housing. The incentives can bemade available to local units of governmentand nonprofit organizations. Here are some other highlights of the omni- bus housing bill. The bill would allocate $1.6 million to the MHFA to be used for current programs thatfinance the construction of new multifamilyrental housing. The funds would be used incollaboration with federal dollars to buildaffordable rental housing. The omnibus bill would appropriate $1.1 million to homelessness prevention pro-grams administered by the MHFA. Of this,$365,000 would go to the Bridges Program,which provides rental assistance to peoplewith disabilities. Programs that assist home ownership would receive $2.2 million, under the omnibus bill.That sum would include $1.6 million to theCommunity Rehabilitation fund for the pro-duction of affordable single-family housingand $500,000 for home ownership zones toencourage ownership in distressed areas. The bill would provide $200,000 to fundprograms seeking to make Minnesota homes healthier. Of that amount, $125,000 wouldgo to fund a healthy home pilot project totrain builders and inspectors. Another$75,000 would fund a program that wouldprovide grants to people who suffer fromMultiple Chemical Sensitivity. The grantswould be used to finance improvements tomake the homes chemical free. Treatment program facilities The expansion of two private facilities for the treatment of addictions would occur un-der separate bills approved by the House Healthand Human Services Committee Feb. 23. HF2793 , sponsored by Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL- Finlayson), calls for the Minnesota IndianPrimary Residential Treatment Center to re-ceive $400,000 from the state to build a youthalcohol treatment wing at the Mash-Ka-WisenTreatment Center located on the Fond du LacIndian Reservation near Cloquet, Minn. The second piece of legislation ( HF2883 ), which is sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls), calls for $750,000 for construc-tion of a building in Granite Falls, Minn.,where treatment would be provided for peopleaddicted to gambling. Under Hilty's bill, the $400,000 in state money would be available only if matched bya $1.5 million federal grant and $100,000 fromthe state American Indian bands. According to Hilty, the Minnesota Depart- ment of Human Services indicated that 319American Indians took treatment at the Mash-Ka-Wisen Treatment Center in 1996. But,Hilty said, the existing facility was designed tohandle only half that number. And he said that even though the center is on American Indian reservation land, \"mostreferrals to the clinic come from HennepinCounty.\" He said the national success rate in alcohol treatment programs is 20 percent for Ameri-can Indians, but the success rate is 40 percentin the Mash-Ka-Wisen Center. \"One reason is because it's culturally spe- cific,\" he said. He said the center currently is not able to treat as many youths as it prefers, and treat-ment is more successful if the youths are keptseparate from adults. Kubly's proposal to mark general fund dol- lars for a gambling addiction program calledProject Turnabout also would require a localmatch of the same amount. The original proposal requested $900,000, but the provision was amended by the com-mittee to $200,000. Kubly subsequently re- ceived a promise from the Minnesota StateLottery to transfer $750,000 in lottery prizemoney into the general fund to be used for theproject. The funds would go for construction of a facility to house recovering gamblers during atwo- to four-week treatment program. Theprogram typically treats 20 people at a timeand operates under a state grant. Kubly said most insurance companies don't cover gambling recovery, \"so there is a bit of agap there.\" Both pieces of legislation are part of the division's omnibus funding bill. MFIP-S emphasis questioned Several Minnesota welfare recipients told legislators they are being forced to take low-paying jobs rather than continue pursuit of adegree that is within their grasp. The situation has concerned some legisla- tors, who believe the intent of the state's newwelfare law is not to just shift citizens fromwelfare to work of any kind, but to providethem with tools that lead to a quality job. \"The goal should be a livable wage, rather than a minimum-wage job,\" Rep. LuanneKoskinen (DFL-Coon Rapids) said. Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) is sponsoring legislation that would require theDepartment of Human Services to providethose moving into the workforce with a clearoutline of the education and training oppor-tunities available under the state's new welfarelaw. \"This legislation basically tells people to do what's in the law,\" Huntley said. The Minnesota Family Investment Pro- gram-Statewide (MFIP-S) emphasizes a quickshift into the workforce, but testimony beforethe finance division of the House Health andHuman Services Committee Feb. 23 depictedsimilar stories of welfare recipients who werewithin a year of a postsecondary degree butwere told they had to find a job. For those so close to completing a training program or college, immediate employmentwould delay or prevent completion of theeducational courses, legislators were told. Huntley said HF2990 seeks to assist mainly women moving off welfare, many of whomare single mothers. He emphasized thatMFIP-S calls for job counselors to approve aneducation or training program and to allowindividuals to postpone a job search if theeducation program can be completed within12 months and is likely to lead to employmentwithout additional training. But anecdotal evidence indicates the ap-13 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY proach to outlining the education alternatives varies among the state's 87 counties. Testi-mony heard by the House panel indicatedsome counties are not providing informationon the training options and are pushing peopleinto the job market. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said, \"Maybe the message isn't getting out to the countiesthat they have to do a better job screening.\" Hesaid that if the program were five years old,there might be a big cause for concern. ButMFIP-S, which sets a five-year lifetime limiton receiving welfare checks, became effectiveJuly 1, 1997. Huntley's bill was approved and is to be included in the omnibus health and humanservices bill. SPORTS The Unity Baptist Adult Choir of St. Paul sings \"God is a Good God\" as part of the invocationbefore the Feb. 25 House floor session.Session song Baseball bill fails A House panel Feb. 26 voted down the only baseball-related bill to be taken up by a Housecommittee this session. HF3348 , sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), would have provided the frame-work for community-based ownership of theMinnesota Twins. The plan originally called for state money from a potential November 1998 budget sur-plus to be loaned to a charitable foundation tobuy the team. That group could have then soldstock to private investors interested in keep-ing the team in Minnesota. \"This bill would send a message that the Legislature of Minnesota is interested in work-ing this out, in keeping the Twins here,\" Kahnsaid. \"It gives a market test of fan and commu-nity support for the team.\" But opponents objected to using what they said was money garnered from overtaxationto make a loan to professional baseball. And even after the bill was stripped of pro- visions allowing for any public money to beused, lawmakers on the House GovernmentOperations Committee voted against approv-ing what remained, which was essentially ablueprint for setting up a community-ownedteam without state involvement. \"To vote for this would be to open up the House floor to another whole debate aboutbaseball and money and stadiums,\" said Rep.Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul). A few days earlier, the State Government Finance Division of the Governmental Opera-tions Committee had heard testimony frommembers of the public opposed to any stateinvolvement in professional sports. \"You guys will not take no for an answer,\"said Charles Test, chair of Minnesota's Liber- tarian Party. \"The people have spoken andthey've said they do not want the state in-volved.\" Property tax breaks for seniors Senior citizens would get a break on prop- erty taxes under three separate bills advancingin the House. HF3169 , sponsored by Rep. Peg Larsen (R- Lakeland), would provide a property tax re-fund for people 65 and older who have lived ina home they own for at least 10 years. HF2838 , sponsored by Rep. John Tuma (R- Northfield), would prohibit market value in-creases for seniors' homes, unless thehomeowners have made improvements HF3585 , sponsored by Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), would loosen the participa-tion requirements in a program passed lastyear aimed at preventing senior citizens wholive on fixed incomes from being driven out oftheir homes by rising property values andtaxes. All three bills were debated Feb. 23 by the Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Di-vision of the House Taxes Committee. In Larsen's bill, the rebate would be above and beyond any other refund eligible seniorsmay receive. The refund would be the amountof property taxes, not of existing refunds, thatexceed 6 percent of the taxpayer's householdincome or 1.25 percent of their home's esti- mated market value, whichever is higher. Ac-cording to an analysis from the Department ofRevenue, refunds would be paid to approxi-mately 60,000 homeowners, and the cost tothe state would be $28.7 million in fiscal 1999,$29.2 million in fiscal 2000, and $29.6 millionin fiscal 2001. Under Tuma's bill, market value increases on homes owned by those 65 and older wouldbe forbidden as long as the owner has lived inthe home for at least five years. There would beno income limitations. Married couples wouldboth have to be at least 65 to qualify.Homeowners would have to apply for thevaluation freeze. Tuma termed it \"an idea that has been floating around the Capitol for a long time.\" Hasskamp's bill would alter a portion of the 1997 omnibus tax law, which created a seniorcitizens' property tax deferral program sched-uled to begin for taxes payable in 1999. The 1997 law calls for the program to allow homeowners over age 65 who have lived intheir homes for at least 15 years and have ahousehold income less than $30,000 to deferproperty taxes that exceed 5 percent of theirincome. Interest not to exceed 5 percent would ac- crue on the deferred amount. The deferral andinterest would be payable within 90 days of thedate when the property is sold, ceases to be ahomestead, the homeowner dies, or the ho-meowner chooses to no longer participate. Hasskamp's bill would modify the senior citizens' property tax deferral program by in-creasing the maximum household income for TAXES14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998 program participation to $40,000. It also would set the annual deferral amount at propertytaxes in excess of 5 percent of the homeowner'sincome in the year of application. The maxi-mum interest rate would be lowered to thelesser of 5 percent or the change in the con-sumer price index. And the bill would allow one year for pay- ment of the deferral and interest when termi-nation occurs because the property ceases tobe a homestead or because the homeownerchooses to no longer participate. All three bills were referred without recom- mendation to the full Taxes Committee. Bev Decker, left, Shoreview, and Jon Weber, Minneapolis, have a message for statelegislators. They brought their signs andfeelings to a Feb. 23 rally on the steps of theCapitol in support of permanent tax cuts.Tax message Property tax reform Homeowners and renters would have a choice in the way they calculate their propertytax refunds that could bring them larger re-turns, under a bill advancing in the House. HF3462 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), was discussed Feb. 23 by theProperty Tax and Tax Increment Finance Di-vision of the House Taxes Committee. Thegoal of her bill is to remove the unlimitednature of the present property tax system. \"There ought to be a limit to people's prop- erty taxes. Tie it to what their income is,\"Greiling said. The present property tax refund system has a cap of $480 for homeowners and $1,120 forrenters. Greiling's bill would eliminate those caps and place a limit on the perentage of one'sincome that can be collected in property taxes. Under Greiling's bill, taxpayers could use either a new method of computation or thecurrent formula, whichever would give themthe higher refund. Greiling's alternative formula would refund the full amount of tax over a percentage ofincome ranging from 2 percent to 6 percent.The formula would be the same forhomeowners and renters. And there would bean adjustment for inflation in the year 2000. A representative of the Minnesota Senior Federation's Tax Committee said that morethan 264,000 Minnesota homeowners wouldbenefit from the bill. According to an estimate from the Depart- ment of Revenue, Greiling's bill could cost thestate approximately $123 million in fiscal year2000 and approximately $134 million in fiscalyear 2001. The bill moves to the full committee with- out recommendation.Tax breaks, rebates, reform The governor's tax initiative for this session includes property tax rebates and reform, anda break for commercial and industrial prop-erty and apartment buildings. HF2604 would \"continue to decrease the state's dependence on property taxes,\" saidbill sponsor Rep. Bill Macklin (R-Lakeville)during a Feb. 25 hearing of the Property Taxand Tax Increment Finance Division of theHouse Taxes Committee. The bill would give a rebate to homeowners and renters equal to 20 percent of their prop-erty taxes paid in 1998. The rebate would beallowed as a refundable income tax credit to beclaimed on the 1998 income tax return, filedin 1999. There would be no maximum rebate. The bill would transfer $500 million to the property tax reform account for payment ofthe rebates. Macklin's bill also would decrease the prop- erty tax rate on houses valued at more than$75,000 from 1.85 percent to 1.75 percent inpayable 1999, then to 1.7 percent thereafter. The tax rate for commercial/industrial and utility property worth up to $150,000 wouldbe reduced to from 2.7 percent to 2.6 percentin 1999, then to 2.5 percent thereafter. The tax rate for apartment buildings withfour units or more would decrease from 2.9 percent to 2.65 percent in 1999, then 2.5 per-cent thereafter. The tax rate on a single-unit rental property worth less than $75,000 would go from 1.9 to1.5 percent in 1999, then to 1.25 percent there-after. The tax rate on properties worth morethan $75,000 would go from 2.1 percent to1.75 percent for 1999, then to 1.7 percentthereafter. The bill was referred to the full Taxes Com- mittee without recommendation. Property tax reduction A reduction in property taxes for homes valued at more than $75,000 has been pro-posed in the House Taxes Committee. HF3491 , sponsored by Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), would reduce the tax on a propertyworth $75,000 or more to 1.75 percent from1.85 percent. Property valued up to $75,000will still be taxed at 1 percent. The bill, which was discussed Feb. 23 by the Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Di-vision of the Taxes Committee, was referred tothe full committee without recommendation. Soaring market values When inflation or other factors push up the value of a home faster than the homeowner'ssalary rises, it can be very difficult for thehomeowner to pay the higher property taxes. Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) sponsors a bill ( HF3720 ) that would try to address that problem. \"This is real property tax reform,\" he said, during a Feb. 23 meeting of the Property Taxand Tax Increment Finance Division of theHouse Taxes Committee. Under the bill, the market value for prop- erty tax purposes for taxes payable in 1999could not be greater than the home's taxablemarket value, plus the amount determined bymultiplying the taxable market value by therate of inflation for the 12-month period end-ing Oct. 31, 1996. After the year 2000, market value increase in determining property taxes would be lim-ited to the lesser of 5 percent of the marketvalue in the previous year or the rate of infla-tion. \"As market values continue to soar, the burden this places on all property owners istough,\" Milbert said. \"What can you do tomake this a fair tax again? It is something thatyou can do this year.\" Changes or improvements to the property made by the owner would be exempted.15 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYRep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), who chairs the Taxes Committee, said she has concerns thatMilbert's bill might freeze property taxes in-equities in place. The bill was referred to the full committee without recommendation. Duplex, triplex owners' taxes With a projected $1.3 billion surplus in state coffers and proposals to give new prop-erty tax rebates to homeowners and renters,there has been little talk about the specificconcerns of duplex or triplex owners \u2014 untilnow. (DFL-St. Paul) is spon- soring HF2989 , which would have the effect of reducing the property taxes paid by owners ofduplexes and triplexes that are rented toothers. The bill was discussed Feb. 24 by the Prop- erty Tax and Tax Increment Finance Divisionof the House Taxes Committee. The proposal would move two- and three- unit non-homestead residential properties(duplexes and triplexes that are not owner-occupied) to a different class in tax codes. Under the bill, the properties would be taxed at 1.9 percent of the first $75,000 in marketvalue and 2.1 percent on the excess over$75,000. Currently, owners of those proper-ties pay 2.1 percent regardless of the marketvalue. Cities would still have the option of denying the lower class designation if the property wasnot in compliance with the existing housingcodes. According to an analysis from the Depart- ment of Revenue, the bill would cost the state$200,000 in the first year. The bill was referred to the full Taxes Com- mittee without recommendation. Reducing property tax rates Two bills considered by a House panel would reduce property tax rates for apartment prop-erties and some businesses, as well as reducingthe general education levy. HF3671 , sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), and HF3672 , sponsored by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), were heardFeb. 23 by the Property Tax and Tax Incre-ment Finance Division of the House TaxesCommittee. The major provisions of the two bills are identical. During the tax division hearing, McElroy said that at a time of a budget surplus, the stateshould take a proactive stance on business-and education-related tax issues.The bills would decrease the tax rate for apartment properties with four or more unitsfrom 2.9 to 2.5 percent and reduce the tax rateon single-unit residential properties valued atmore than $75,000 from 1.9 percent to 1.25percent. Duplexes and triplexes would receivesimilar reductions. The tax rates for commercial and industrial property valued at more than $150,000 wouldgo from 4 percent to 3.5 percent, McElroysaid. The bills call for a total of $100 million to be appropriated to reduce the general educa-tional tax rate and to increase the maximumeducation homestead credit from $225 to $400. According to an analysis from the Depart- ment of Revenue, the bills would cost the stateapproximately $400 million over the next twoyears. The bills were referred to the full committee without recommendation. Incentive to rehabilitate Central city areas often contain dilapidated residential properties, and there is little incen-tive for someone to buy the properties and fixthem up. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) is trying to provide that incentive with HF3778 , a bill that would provide a 10-year property taxexemption for \"marginal homes in marginalneighborhoods\" that are refurbished by theowner. The bill was heard Feb. 25 in the Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Division ofthe House Taxes Committee. \"What you're appealing to is the urban pio- neer,\" Wagenius said. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) sup- ported the bill. He said there are a lot of homesin his district priced at below $20,000, and that$40,000 would fix them up. To qualify, a home would have to be in need repairs of at least $20,000 and be an owner-occupied, single-family dwelling in a neigh-borhood where the median value of the homeis less than the median value of the entire city.Only homes in Minneapolis, St. Paul, andDuluth would be eligible. The bill was referred to the full Taxes Com- mittee without recommendation. Raising renter's credit Some have called the Minnesota property tax system regressive and burdensome forhomeowners. If that's true, the system mustalso be a burden on renters, who pay propertytaxes indirectly through their rent and gener-ally earn less than homeowners.That's the philosophy of Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul). Dawkins sponsoringHF3657 , which tax refund, or \"renter's credit,\" from 18 to20 percent of gross rent paid. His bill and another similar proposal were discussed Feb. 23 by the Property Tax and TaxIncrement Finance Division of the HouseTaxes Committee. \"The renter's credit is the only method we have to provide a credit to tenants,\" Dawkinssaid. \"As we move down the road and reformproperty taxes, we can't leave renters behind.This is a credibility issue.\" Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) also sup- ported the bill. \"I would say 18 percent is very much on the low side and should be raised,\" he said. If passed, the bill would cost the state an estimated $15.8 million in fiscal year 2000 and$16.2 million in fiscal year 2001. HF3595 , sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), would similarly increase thetax refund to 20 percent of rent paid. Both bills were referred to the full Taxes Committee without recommendation. Videos on property tax Elected officials, administrators, journal- ists, and many taxpayers often struggle tounderstand the state's property tax system,sometimes without success. So officials of the Association of Minnesota Counties think it might be a good idea to havesome training programs for the public, andthat's what they have suggested. The organization is backing a bill ( HF3739 ), sponsored by Rep. Gail Skare (DFL-Bemidji),that asks for $50,000 from the state to producevideos to educate the public about the prop-erty tax system and how it works. The Property Tax and Tax Increment Fi- nance Division of the House Taxes Commit-tee discussed the bill Feb. 23. \"We hear how difficult it is to understand property tax and how it is calculated. I thinkwe legislators don't understand it the way weshould,\" Skare said. There were some suggestions from the com- mittee that the counties association shouldpay for the production itself, but Jim Mulder,speaking for the organization, said propertytaxes are a statewide concern. Under the bill, the educational materials would be made available to the Department ofRevenue and to each county government at nocost for distribution to local media and else-where. The bill moves to the full Taxes Committee without recommendation.16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.usProperty tax reform account A bill awaiting consideration by the House Taxes Committee would call for funds fromthe state's property tax reform account to beused to reduce the levy for the Twin Cities'public transit system. Current law lists several allowed uses for funds from the property tax reform account,including reducing property tax class rates,increasing the property tax refund, and in-creasing the state's share of education fundingto cut reliance on local property taxes. HF2954, sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), would stipulate that the top prior-ity for use of property tax reform account fundswould be to reduce the reliance on propertytaxes of the metropolitan transit system. The bill was discussed Feb. 23 by the Prop- erty Tax and Tax Increment Finance Divisionof the House Taxes Committee. The bill would require that the levy for the Twin Cities transit provide a percentage of theoverall budget for the system equal to theaverage property tax reliance for other transitsystems around the state. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), a co- sponsor of the bill, urged lawmakers to sup-port the plan. \"If we don't figure out some other way to pay for this, we may end up with a small[property] tax increase in many parts of themetro area,\" he said. The bill was referred to the full Taxes Com- mittee without recommendation. Income tax reduction A bill that would decrease income taxes for those making up to $98,000 per year is headedto the House Taxes Committee. HF2900 , sponsored by Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview), would create new income taxbrackets and cut the rates paid by people inthose brackets. The bill was considered Feb. 23 by the Prop- erty Tax and Tax Increment Finance Divisionof the Taxes Committee. The panel voted tosend the bill to the full committee withoutrecommendation. The bill would decrease the tax rate paid by low- to moderate-income earners, includingthose making up to $24,800 per year who nowpay a rate of 6 percent. Krinkie's bill wouldcreate a new bracket for people earning up to$40,000 and set a 5.5 percent rate for suchpeople. Income taxes in a new middle bracket ($40,001 to $98,000 per year) would be 7percent. Most people in that range currentlypay 8 percent.Those with an annual income of more than $98,000 would continue to be taxed at 8.5percent. \"That money does not belong to the gov- ernment, it belongs to the citizens,\" said DavidStrom, legislative director for the TaxpayersLeague of Minnesota. \"It's obvious Minnesotataxpayers are overtaxed. I think it [the bill]provides relief for citizens.\" The bill also would put any surplus in state coffers beyond the $522 million budget re-serve into the general fund. Currently, 60 per-cent of the remaining surplus goes to a propertytax reform account and 40 percent goes to thegeneral fund. Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston), who chairs the tax division, urged caution whenconsidering a permanent tax cut. \"If the economy goes in the dumper, how long will it be before we are back at the door-step?\" Olson asked. New hockey arena St. Paul will build a new downtown hockey arena with or without state help, but the citywould not have to pay sales tax on the con-struction materials for the project, under a billadvancing in the House. HF3556 , sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), asks for a waiver on sales tax inbuilding the new arena at the city-ownedRiverCentre complex that will house theMinnesota Wild, the new National HockeyLeague franchise in Minnesota. The bill was discussed Feb. 24 by the Sales and Income Tax Division of the House TaxesCommittee. With the waiver, the state would lose close to $3 million in tax funds, according to ananalysis from the Department of Revenue. The arena will cost $130 million, said Joe Reid, director of finance for the city of St. Paul.The city has asked for $65 million in statebonds to help pay for the new arena, Reid said. The proposal for state construction funds is now being considered by the House CapitalInvestment Committee. If no state help isforthcoming, the city has committed to build-ing the arena itself with city-backed bonds.The Wild is to begin play in September 2000. The waiver of sales tax proposal was re- ferred to the full Taxes Committee withoutrecommendation.TV commercials and sales tax The production of television commercials is the backbone of Minnesota's film industry,yet that industry is subject to a 6.5 percentsales tax, said Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-SouthSt. Paul). Milbert is sponsoring a bill ( HF3705 ) that would exempt those associated with makingtelevision commercials, including the adver-tising agency, the film production company,the edit house, and other vendors, from pay-ing sales tax on their cost of materials and onthe sale of the product. The bill was heard Feb. 24 by the Sales and Income Tax Division of the House TaxesCommittee. Advertising agencies must pay sales or use tax on materials incorporated into the pro-duction of a piece of advertising. When theagency uses a film production company, anedit house, or other vendor, the product thevendor sells to the agency is taxable. \"The bill before you will help Minnesota compete,\" said Ruth Johnston, executive pro-ducer for James Productions. \"We feel thislegislation is vital.\" \"We're at the top end [on sales taxes],\" Milbert said, so producers would be likely togo to another state to make their commercial.\"Unless we do something, the problem is likelyto get worse.\" The bill, which was referred to the full Taxes Committee without recommendation, is sup-ported by the Minnesota Film Board, he said. Help for employee housing Employers who help provide financial help for their employees' housing could get a taxbreak, under a bill being considered in theHouse. HF2369 , sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls), would give employers a50 percent tax credit for their cash contribu-tions to employee housing. The bill was heardFeb. 24 in the Sales and Income Tax Divisionof the House Taxes Committee. \"There is a serious shortage of housing . . . where I live, and any affordable housing is rareand an obstacle to future economic develop-ment,\" Kubly said. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) had a few reser- vations because those businesses that get thetax credit might have to pay more on theirfederal taxes. \"If we can generate $10 million in tax cred- its, we are making a charitable contribution tothe federal government of about three-and-a-half million dollars,\" she said. The bill was referred to the full committee without recommendation.17 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYTRANSPORTATION Transportation funding Legislators hope to have more state troop- ers on the road \u2014 and more dollars than thegovernor requested for state road construc-tion \u2014 under the $52.5 million transporta-tion funding bill passed Feb. 26 by the House.The vote was 121-7. The House Transportation and Transit Committee's bill would accelerate thegovernor's request of $60 million over thenext three fiscal years for state roadconstruction. HF3057 , sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), would appropriate $40million from the trunk highway fund for roadconstruction in fiscal year 1999. Legislatorsproject that money will be available to ad-equately fund at or above the governor's pro-posed level of $20 million in both 2000 and2001. Lawmakers are basing that assumptionon the current trunk highway balance, plusanticipated surpluses in federal funds and stategas and registration tax dollars. The bill also would appropriate $6.8 mil- lion from the trunk highway fund in fiscal year1999 for road design and construction engi-neering. That is twice the governor's request.The engineering appropriation is calculatedby a formula; doubling the construction ap-propriation in the bill forced legislators todouble the engineering request. More troopers The governor has requested that 47 new state patrol officers and support staff be addedat a cost of $5.25 million. The House bill callsfor 40 additional troopers and support staff ata cost of $4.55 million. Currently, there are 488 state troopers on the road in Minnesota, and another 39 intraining. The current allowable full-fundedcomplement is 535. In 1996, the governor sought funds to hire 46 additional state troopers to be included inthe Department of Public Safety budget. Butthe 1996 law that provided $60.1 million intransportation spending had only enoughmoney to hire four state patrol dispatchers. An amendment removed a provision from this year's bill that called for funding for thestate patrol to come from the general fund,rather than from the state trunk highway fund,which is used for most highway expansion,construction and repair. The shift of the high-way patrol to the general fund would have leftan additional $41 million available in the trunkhighway fund for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.Some legislators had hoped shifting the state patrol to the general fund would help lay thegroundwork for a new transportation fundthat could be used for highways, bridges, andother public transit, such as commuter rail orlight rail. Lieder said the only effect this change would have had on the state patrol would be itssource of funding. All appropriations for thestate patrol, with the exception of motor ve-hicle inspection and enforcement activities,would have come from the general fund, un-der the original bill. In line with the governor's request, the bill also would appropriate $694,000 from thetrunk highway fund to replace and maintainequipment in the statewide emergency com-munications system of the state patrol. The bill also includes $294,000 for addi- tional Capitol complex security staff, but un-like the governor's plan, the language providesthe state patrol with the option of using someof the funds for increased helicopter patrols.Registration task force Under the bill, $50,000 would be appropri- ated from the highway user tax distributionfund to the commissioner of public safety,who would designate four members of thestate highway patrol to investigate the inci-dence of vehicle registration evasion and dealerfraud. It is believed countless Minnesota residents register their motor vehicles in neighboringstates, which have lower licensing fees. Esti-mates indicate this costs the state millionsannually, even though it is a gross misde-meanor for vehicles owned and operated inMinnesota to be registered in another state. Vehicle registration revenue goes into the highway user tax distribution fund, from whereit is distributed to the trunk highway fund,county state-aid highway fund, and munici-pal state-aid street fund. The study, to be conducted by the Driver and Vehicle Services Division of the Depart-ment of Public Safety, would evaluate thecost-effectiveness and benefit of exchangingtax, vehicle registration, and driver's licenseinformation with other states. It would alsostudy any advantages for the state to use aprivate vendor database to track vehicle regis-tration. It has been proposed that a database could be designed in cooperation with the automo-bile insurance industry or other vendors, whichcould also help enforce Minnesota's manda-tory auto insurance laws. The final report of the task force would be presented to the governor and the Legislatureby Feb. 15, 1999. Blue lights The commissioner of public safety would be required to study the desirability of allow-ing certain emergency vehicles to display flash-ing blue lights in both the front and back of thevehicles, under the bill. The study would be done within the current Department of Public Safety budget. Minnesota is one of two states that does not allow blue lights in the front of its emergencyvehicles. Currently, all transportation depart-ment sanding and plowing vehicles use bluelights. The state highway patrol has expressed a desire to study the use of blue lights in thefront of only emergency vehicles, such as lawenforcement, fire safety vehicles, and ambu-lances. The study would investigate the feasi-bility and cost of switching lights on roadequipment vehicles to another color, such asamber or orange. Results would be presented to the governor and the Legislature no later than Jan. 15, 1999.

Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Newport) be- lieves the system in place for building, main-taining, and improving roads and for providingpublic transit in Minnesota is not working andneeds to be replaced. She has introduced a bill ( HF3265 ) that would put a constitutional amendment on theballot, asking voters if they want to provide anew way to pay for roads. The bill was tabled Feb. 26 by the House Taxes Committee, but it is expected to comeup for consideration later this session. \"Right now we have a transportation fund- ing system that simply is not working for themetro area or the rest of the state. There areclearly needs around the state that are notbeing met,\" Marko said. That system takes money from gas taxes and license fees and puts it into a dedicated trans-portation fund. A total of 62 percent of thatmoney goes to the state and 29 percent goes tocounties. Of that money spent on transporta-tion, approximately 35 percent goes to theTwin Cities metropolitan area and the restgoes to Greater Minnesota projects. \"Consequently the system is unbalanced because rural highways are competing withmetro-area highways,\" Marko said. One prediction is that the metropolitan area will need $6 billion in new roads in theSirens and flashing red lights A bill headed for the governor's desk would require all medical emergency vehicles tosound an audible signal and activate red emer-gency lights while responding to emergencies. Last session, legislation to exempt law en- forcement officers from the requirement tosound audible signals while responding toemergency calls included language that alsoexempted emergency medical vehicles. Lawenforcement officers wanted an exemptionfrom sounding their sirens in response situa-tions that would telegraph their arrival, suchas when responding to silent burglar alarms,and jeopardize police investigations. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), sponsor of the current House bill, said that after the 1997law was approved, insurance carriers begantelling owners of emergency medical vehiclesthat rates for coverage would rise if both au-dible and visible signals were not used whileresponding to emergencies. The bill ( HF2576/SF2028* ) passed in the House Feb. 23 on a vote of 132-0. Juhnke said legislators want to reinstate language in statute that would require emer-gency medical vehicles to sound alarms whileresponding to emergencies because it is saferfor ambulance drivers, other motorists, andpedestrians to have the audible warning inaddition to flashing red lights. Medical vehicles that are transporting pa- tients in non-emergency situations would notbe required to sound their alarms. 'Vanity' plates for pickups Drivers of one-ton capacity pickup trucks would be able to get personalized license platesunder a bill moving to the Senate.

The spending goals would notbe binding, but they would set a direction forstate policy. The bill proposes that $500 million ought to be spent annually from the trunk highwayfund for construction and reconstruction ofstate highways. Public transit is also heavily considered. The bill would set a goal of not less than $15million for capital improvements and $17million for operating assistance on public tran-sit outside the seven-county metropolitan area. The total state spending goal per year on public transit in the seven-county metropoli-tan area would be set at not less than $32million for capital improvements and $60million for operating assistance. The bill also proposes that the commis- sioner of transportation submit in thedepartment's biennial budget a plan of rec-ommended expenditures from the generalfund for trunk highway and public transitpurposes. The plan would be developedthrough existing area transportationpartnerships.next 25 years. And there are also concerns about funding public transit projects. Marko's bill would propose the constitu- tional amendment to go on the ballot thisNovember. If approved, a new transportationfund would be established using money frommotor vehicle license and 20 percent of themoney from the motor vehicle sales tax. Money from the new fund would be spent to match federal aid to state and local govern-ment for highways and transit. That might allow the state to get more money under the Intermodal Surface TransportationEfficiency Act, which ties federal money tostate funds. The goal of the federal program isto preserve current transportation systems andencourage innovative ones. That could in-clude light rail transit.of 130-0. The measure would allow pickup trucks with a manufacturer's rating of one-ton capacity or less to bear \"vanity\" plates. Under present law, the maximum for pickup trucks to be eligible for these plates is 9,000pounds gross weight. Pickup trucks of up tothree-quarter ton capacity qualify. Purchasers would have to pay a one-time fee of $100 in addition to the registration taxon the vehicle, under the legislation spon-sored by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington). The bill also would expand eligibility for special license plates for firefighters. The platescarry no special privileges, but they designatethe driver as a firefighter. The bill would sim-ply allow retired firefighters to have the specialplates.19 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYContinued from page 4 bonding bill being assembled by the House Capital Investment Committee. The proposed academies would be geared to high school students who are unsuccess-fully bounced between foster families or thosewhose parents feel a residential environmentcould help get their child on the right track. Policy changes Kelso's bill also contains several education policy changes that have no costs or requireonly minimal funding. Most of those plansreflect lawmakers' stated desire to return morecontrol to the districts. One such provision would repeal the cur- rent cap on school superintendents' salariesby removing school districts from the list ofgroups that are prohibited from paying em-ployees more than 95 percent of the governor'ssalary. Several metropolitan-area districts have had difficulty recruiting and retaining top-notchsuperintendents because of the state's rela-tively low pay scale for those positions. Another plan would allow districts to start school before Labor Day. The tourism indus-try has been opposed to that change because ofpotential lost revenue from a shortened sum-mer travel season. Also, the bill would allow districts to re- quire certain students to attend summerschool. Districts that elect to do so would settheir own criteria. The omnibus bill also would prohibit schools from charging home-schooled stu-dents more than pubic school students toparticipate in extra-curricular activities. That provision was originally proposed in another bill ( HF2836 ), sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), that was offered inresponse to complaints from home-schoolingparents who said high price tags kept theirchildren effectively out of many school dis-trict activities. You could say that 19th-century Minnesota edu-cator Maria L. Sanford isone of the six most hon-ored women in America. A statue commemorating the education and human rights pioneer is one of 96 bronzeand marble works that adorn Statuary Hall atthe U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. All 50states were invited to donate two memorialsof notable citizens for the collection, but onlysix states\u2014 including Minnesota \u2014 chose tohonor women. In fact, Sanford was not even a native of Minnesota, but when she died in 1920 afteralmost 30 years as a professor of rhetoric atthe University of Minnesota, she was re-membered as \"the best lovedwoman of the North StarState.\" She had spent the yearssince 1880 in Minnesota cru-sading for the rights of womenand racial minorities. Although her peers had long recognized her contributions,it wasn't until 22 years afterher death that the Maria L.Sanford statue was proposedto the Minnesota Legislature.It then took another 16 yearsbefore the statue was ap-proved, funded, commis-sioned, completed, andunveiled in Washington, D. C. It wasn't entirely due to law- makers' procrastination thatthe process dragged out solong \u2014 state officials in the1940s stipulated that theWashington dedicationshould take place in 1958, theSanford statue finds place at U.S. Capitol year Minnesota marked one hundred yearsof statehood. The first bill dealing with Sanford's statue was passed during the 1943 legislativesession. Spearheaded by the Minnesota Federa- tion of Women's Clubs, the legislationreserved the remaining Minnesota-desig-nated spot at Washington's Statuary Hallfor a statue of Sanford. Minnesota hadpreviously donated a statue of Henry Rice,one of the state's first two U.S. senators. But the 1943 law merely reserved the space for the Sanford statue; the measuredidn't provide any funding for the project.So for the next four years, a Maria L.Sanford Memorial Council tried unsuc- cessfully to gather funds. A decade later, Sen. Elmer L. Anderson (a future Min-nesota governor) and Rep.Leo Mosier sponsored a billto include $25,000 for thestatue in the budget for thestate's centennial celebra-tion. Once the money wassecured, a Maria L. Sanfordcommittee, working underthe state's Centennial Com-mission, had just over a yearto select a sculptor, commis-sion the statue, and organizethe unveiling ceremony. In November 1958, the bronze statue, sculpted byEvelyn Raymond of Minne-apolis, was dedicated inStatuary Hall in front of anaudience of 350. Photo from: Acceptance of the Statue of Maria L.

The $9.4 million bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul), was approved bythe committee Feb. 25. The bill now moves tothe House Ways and Means Committee. Here's a look at some of the major provi- sions of the bill. Living with livestock An amended version of Rep. Doug Peterson's (DFL-Madison) so-called \"livingwith livestock\" bill ( rolled into the omnibus bill. \"Basically, during this whole debate, I've been trying to move toward the middleground,\" Peterson said. \"I think the positionis one of common sense.\" Most notably, the bill would impose a mora- torium on new construction or expansion offeedlots at the level of 750 animal units. (Ananimal unit is an indication of waste producedby certain species. One animal unit is equal toone steer or heifer, 2.5 hogs over 55 pounds, or100 chickens.) The bill would prohibit the issuance of per- mits to construct or expand clay, earthen, orflexible membrane (plastic-lined) waste la-goons. Dairy operations under 750 units wouldbe exempt from this provision. After March 1, 2000, those who commer- cially manage and apply animal wastes wouldhave to hold valid animal waste technicianlicenses issued by the Department of Agricul-ture. Most family farmers would be exemptfrom the provision. The bill would clarify the power of a county to adopt feedlot ordinances that are morestringent than those of the Minnesota Pollu-tion Control Agency (PCA). Under the bill, the PCA would be autho- rized to deny permits to feedlot operators whohave bad environmental records in other states. The bill also would mandate a generic envi- ronmental impact statement to examine thelong-term effects of the livestock industry onthe economy and environment in Minnesota. Personal watercraft Portions of the proposed \"personal water- craft courtesy and safety act\" backed by Rep.Environmental spending . . Kris (DFL-Crosby) also have beenfolded into the environment finance omnibusbill. In order to track with the Senate, the policy part of Hasskamp's plan ( HF1351 ) was sepa- rated from the policy bill that includes a per- sonal watercraft ban on lakes of 200 acres orless awaits a debate on the House floor, but theSenate companion policy bill is languishing incommittee. The personal watercraft language that has been included in Osthoff's finance bill wouldrequire that personal watercraft operators passa mandatory safety course and pay a $10 feefor a certificate. The bill also would establish a$30 fee for three-year personal watercraft li-censes. The fees would be earmarked for theDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR) forpersonal watercraft law enforcement costs. The bill would mandate a DNR study on the impact of personal watercraft on loons andloon nesting areas. Snowmobile studs Under another provision of the bill, no snowmobile with a track equipped with metalstuds could be operated on public lands, roads,or trails. Although many claim that studs make for safer riding, proponents of the measure saypaved snowmobile trails are being destroyedby studs. During a Feb. 25 hearing, Ron Nargang, deputy commissioner of the DNR, said thedepartment supports the ban. There are 275,000 registered snowmobiles in Minnesota, Nargang said. Of those sleds, 25percent to 30 percent have studs. Rep. Thomas Bakk (DFL-Cook) objected to the proposed ban. \"It's punitive to those responsible riders who have spent $500 [for the studs],\" he said.\"They use studs for safety.\" Osthoff, who chairs the finance committee, disagreed. \"You know who this is punitive to \u2014 those jerks who are tearing up our trails,\" he said. Mississippi whitewater The city of Minneapolis was born on the banks of the Mississippi River at St. AnthonyFalls. Early citizens of the city harnessed thefalls' tremendous water power for industrialpurposes. A provision of the omnibus bill would ex- plore the possibility of harnessing the falls'water power for recreational pursuits. Under the bill, the DNR would receive $100,000 to conduct engineering and hydrau-lic research into the possible development of awhitewater park for kayaking, rafting, andcanoeing at St. Anthony Falls.The dairy industry in Minnesota generates $3.5 billion in annual gross revenues and employs about39,000 people. Under the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance omnibus bill,Minnesota dairy farmers would receive $100,000 to assist with the costs of litigation against the federalgovernment to reform the \"discriminatory\" milk pricing system. Continued on page 2121 February 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY The research also would be required to ad- dress economic and environmental impactsand public safety concerns. The Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Committee heard testi-mony on the plan Feb. 23. The site would be on the east bank of the Mississippi River, just upstream from the In-terstate 35W bridge near the Stone Arch Bridge. The park would consist of a man-made channel with controllable water flow for ama-teur enthusiasts and international competi-tors alike. It would be designed to connect with exist- ing bike and walking paths along the Missis-sippi. \"The view from the Stone Arch Bridge would be excellent,\" Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls)said. \"It's the one place we can get close to theriver.\" Similar water parks exist in Indiana and overseas in France, Spain, Germany, andCzechoslovakia, Bill Tilton, of the MississippiWhitewater Park Development Corporation,told the panel. \"People are realizing the rivers aren't just for hydroelectric power,\" Tilton said. \"Ourrallying cry is 'Bring back St. Anthony Falls.'\" Tornado damage Five funnel clouds tore through 5,300 acres of sparsely populated forests in Morrison, MilleLacs, Kanabec, and Crow Wing counties onSept. 18, 1997, leaving a path of destruction 25miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide. Rep. Stephen G. Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) described the ravaged forests to the commit-tee Feb. 23. One life and more than $1 million in timber were lost, Wenzel said. \"I, in my lifetime, have never seen such calamity and damage,\" he said. \"It's abso-lutely astounding that something this damag-ing could get so little attention.\" The DNR would receive $75,000 for grants to assist landowners with reforestation efforts,under the bill. Gypsy moths The bill calls for the Department of Agriculture's gypsy moth trapping and eradi-cation program to be allocated $265,000. The leaf-eating insects have already infested Michigan and Wisconsin and are slowlymarching westward. In past years, the department has dispatched field workers to capture male gypsy moths insticky traps that are baited with female mothscents. The department's lab is developing biologi-Lee Johnston, of the Minnesota Milk Pro- ducers Association, said the lawsuit is an at-tempt to \"level the playing field\" so thatMinnesota's dairy farmers can compete withother dairy regions in the country. Deformed frogs The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency would receive $375,000 for research into thecause of deformities found in frogs across thestate. Currently, researchers are speculating that groundwater contamination or possible ul-traviolet radiation may be the cause of thedeformities. The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency also has begun to examine theissue. \"We had better find out what's causing this environmental degradation,\" Rep. WillardMunger (DFL-Duluth) said Jan. 26 during anEnvironment and Natural Resources Com-mittee hearing. \"Or else, we're next.\" Minnesota Zoo shortfall The Minnesota Zoological Gardens would receive $500,000 for operating costs to makeup for a serious shortfall in gate receipts lastsummer. The Apple Valley zoo was forced to ask the Legislature for help after a string of bad luck,bad weather, and bad press, Kathryn Roberts,the zoo's director, said during a Jan. 28hearing. The bill would require the zoo to address its attendance forecasting methods to avoid simi-lar budget problems in the future. Living snow fences The Board of Water and Soil Resources would receive $100,000 to fund a voluntaryprogram for landowners to plant and main-tain trees, shrubs, and grass strips alongsideroads in an effort to control drifting and blow-ing snow. The money would be available through grants to soil and water conservation districtsto enter into cost-sharing contracts with land-owners. The contracts could provide for annual pay- ments to the landowners to cover land andmaintenance costs. cal control agents such as parasites that feedon gypsy moth eggs. The money would supplement the biologi- cal control program and allow for more fieldpersonnel. Helping hog farmers Market Champ Inc., a nonprofit corpora- tion that transfers high-quality genetic mate-rial from the University of Minnesota to familyfarmers around the state, would receive$250,000. Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) introduced the program to the Environment,Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee Feb. 25. \"Some of the technology of genetics is not readily available to family farmers,\" Winter said. As for the meat from genetically advanced hogs, \"people say it tastes better,\" Winter said. Helping dairy farmers Minnesota dairy farmers are currently en- gaged in a lawsuit against the federal govern-ment (Minnesota Milk Producers Association v. Glickman) to bring about reform of the federal milk market pricing system. The bill would give the farmers another $100,000 in state money for the legal battle. Low prices paid to farmers are driving them out of the dairy business. Minnesota loses anaverage of three dairy farms per day. \"Our congressional delegation has not done its joband taken an interest in this issue,\" Wenzelsaid during a Feb. 23 hearing. \"This is what Irefer to as 'the quiet crisis.'\" Wenzel sponsored a House resolution last year that called for an end to a pricing systemthat is \"profoundly unfair and discriminatoryagainst Minnesota and Upper Midwest dairyproducers.\" If you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.Research into the cause of deformities found infrogs like these would receive an infusion of freshcash under the House Environment, NaturalResources and Agriculture Finance omnibus bill.Continued from page 2022 SESSION WEEKLY / February 27, 1998In the Hopper . . .

They helped to elect the 20th governor of Minnesota, Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus, by a plurality of the largest majority ofvotes cast for governor (783,627) in the state's history until that time. When thousands of women exercised their rights across the state, most demonstrated their preference for the issues that J.A.O. Preus advocated\u2014endorsement of farm coop-erative agencies, a fair and equitable tax on iron ore, and \". . . a constructive platform . .. answered by fair and reasonable discussion.\" A long-time civil servant, Preus' first job with the state was executive clerk to Gov. Adolph Eberhart in 1909. Two years later, he was appointed by the governor to beinsurance commissioner, serving in that post for the next four years. He was elected tostate auditor in 1915, and served two terms in the position until he became governor in1921. By 1922, the Farmer-Labor candidate, Magnus Johnson, \"an actual tiller of the soil,\" was pitted against the incumbent governor. Preus won his re-election, but his voter margin ofvictory was cut down to 14,277 from his 1920 election win of 47,986 votes. A progressive movement supported by women's suffrage gained momentum in the state, finally making inroads into how the electorate would vote. The Farmer-Laborvoters, for example, deposed Republican U.S. Sen. Frank B. Kellogg by supporting HenrikShipstead in 1923. In July 1923, after the death of U.S. Sen. Knute Nelson, Johnson was endorsed again and won to serve out Nelson's term. This ended a 22-year monopoly by Republicans in the U.S.Senate. Previously, Charles A. Towne, a Democrat, served for one year beginning in 1900,and before he was elected, only two other Democrats became U.S. senators: James Shields(1858-1859) and Henry M. Rice (1858-1863). Preus realized that if he stepped down as governor to be appointed by the new governor to Nelson's vacant seat, it would be a very unpopular political move. Preus called a specialelection, but although regarded as the heir apparent to the national office, he did notsucceed. Preus was viewed as one of \"great industry, intelligence, and efficiency.\" One of Preus' close associates was a Lutheran minister. The governor became the guardian of theminister's daughter after the death of his friend. The minister's daughter, Agnes Jensen,later became the first secretary to chief clerk Oscar Arneson in the early 1920s (See story,page 16). She went on to serve under six other chief clerks. Thanks to those like Preus who supported women's victories in the first quarter of the 20th century, women rights continued to grow and become even more victorious. \u2014 LeClair Grier Lambert3 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Grant MartinThe 1998 omnibus judiciary finance and crime prevention bill ( SF3345 ) passed the full House relatively unscathed March 2. The vote was 74-56. This year's omnibus crime bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown)and Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), saw fewamendments offered on the House floor com-pared to the action on similar crime bills inrecent years. The Senate passed its version of the bill Feb. 23. The bill now goes to conference com-mittee, where lawmakers will hash out thedifferences in the two proposals. The most substantial amendment offered on the House floor was sponsored by Rep.Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls). The amend-Judiciary finance and crime prevention bill . . . Penalties increased for repeat violent offenders ment would classify murder committed in thecourse of a kidnapping a heinous crime. Aperson convicted of such a crime could besentenced to life without parole, Minnesota'stoughest sentence. Wenzel told the body that his amendment is in response to the 1996 murder-kidnapping ofPaul Antonich, the Two Harbors teenagertaken from his car in Duluth after a minortraffic accident. Here are some other highlights of the omni- bus crime prevention bill.Getting tough The omnibus crime prevention bill includes several provisions aimed at lengthening pen-alties for certain crimes. One of the more controversial provisions, backed by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka),would require life imprisonment for crimi-nals convicted of three violent felony-levelcrimes. The provision also includes languagefor judicial discretion in applying the newsentence requirements. In addition to the \"three strikes\" provision, the bill has another provision that would alsoaddress repeat violent offenders. The provi-sion, which comes from a separate bill spon-sored by Skoglund, would restructure currentlaw that requires tougher penalties for \"careercriminals\" and would reduce the number of violent crimes required to receive these harsher sentences. Skoglund's plan also addresses credits an offender can receive against a term of incar-ceration. The provision makes general changesto these laws to keep repeat violent offendersbehind bars for longer periods of time. The bill also would increase penalties for felons convicted of violent offenses who arefound illegally in possession of a firearm. Cur-rently, the mandatory minimum prison sen-tence is 18 months; the bill would increase the mandatory minimum to five years. Another provision in the bill increases pen- alties generally for soliciting a prostitute orreceiving profit from prostitution. This provi-sion also increases the penalties for engagingin prostitution in a school zone or in a residen-tial area. Charging burglars A provision of the omnibus crime bill will make it easier to prosecute people who ille-gally enter a property by expanding the defini-tion of burglary to include accomplices. Prosecutors said the new language would make the law more explicit and allow them tobring charges against anyone who illegallyenters a dwelling, even if they don't actuallybreak in or steal something. Prosecuting gangs Prosecutors also told legislators that they have difficulties bringing gang members totrial and making the penalties stick. Severalprovisions in the omnibus crime bill seek toaddress such concerns. One provision would expand a current law that provides increased penalties for crimesdone for the benefit of a gang to include crimesmotivated by \"involvement with\" a gang. Thisprovision also increases these enhancedpenalties. The bill would increase penalties for wit- ness tampering, and would add witness tam-pering to the list of crimes that can receiveenhanced penalties if done for the benefit of agang. The bill also seeks to get people to show up for court, both offenders and witnesses. Oneprovision would increase the penalty for fail-ure to appear in court if charged with a felonylevel crime. Another provision would increase penalties for individuals who knowingly and willinglydefy a court subpoena to appear in relation toa violent crime. Fighting drugs The omnibus bill would increase the penal- ties for manufacturing, possessing, or sellingmethamphetamine. Law enforcement officialssaid that Minnesota is seeing a dramatic in-crease in use of the drug. A provision in the omnibus judiciary finance and crime prevention bill would authorize police officersto perform pat-down searches on juveniles taken into custody. Officers said that they were surprised tosee cases against juveniles thrown out of court because, under current law, pat-down searches can beperformed only on adult offenders.4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998 The bill would raise the drug to the same status as cocaine and heroin and would makethe manufacture of any amount of metham-phetamine a first-degree controlled substanceoffense. The bill also makes the drug ephedrine a controlled substance, to be dispensed only byprescription in most instances. The targetedover-the-counter products containing ephe-drine are reportedly taken by teenagers andothers looking to achieve a legal high. Drive-by shootings A provision in the omnibus bill makes mur- der committed during a drive-by shooting afirst-degree murder crime, increasing theprison sentence for the offense. The crime bill would also raise the maxi- mum penalty from a five-year prison term toa 20-year term for firing into an occupiedvehicle. Conditional release The omnibus bill would make several changes to the state's probation and condi-tional release law. Most notably, the bill wouldrequire that each convicted felon released onprobation carry a card that would state theterms of the individual's release. The person on conditional release would be required to produce the card when requestedby a police or probation officer, which wouldallow the officer to know if the parolee isviolating the terms of his or her parole. The bill also would allow peace officers to detain for 36 hours a person on conditionalrelease if the officer has reasonable cause tobelieve that the individual has violated theterms of his or her release. The bill also prohibits courts from releasing individuals on bail who have been found guiltyof a crime where the Sentencing GuidelinesCommission requires a prison sentence. Cur-rently, offenders can be released on bail beforesentencing in these situations. Juvenile criminals The omnibus crime bill would also open some juvenile court records and proceedingsto the public. For juveniles under 14 years old, the bill would make court records available to thepublic if the juvenile is found guilty of a thirdfelony or gross misdemeanor level offense. For juveniles who are 14 years old or older, the bill would open all court hearings to thepublic, regardless of the offense. The recordswould be closed to the public when the juve-nile turns 21. The omnibus bill also would increase pen-By Sandy Donovan There was only one other woman in the Legislature when Joan Anderson Growe was elected to the House in 1972. Still, when Growe and four fellow female freshmen brought that number up to six, one newspaper warned: \"The women aretaking over.\" However tongue-in-cheek that headline may have been, in Growe's case it was an aptdescription: In the 25 years since then, she has taken over the state's voting and election procedures, improving voter turnout andpushing for reforms in the election process. \"It's been a wonderful experience for someone who once never thought of mak-ing a life in public service,\" the six-term secretary of state said. \"And I've enjoyed ev-ery minute of it.\" Growe spent only one term in the Housebefore moving on to the secretary of state's of- fice, but Minnesota'scurrent open meeting laws are a testament to her time as a DFL law-maker from Minne- tonka. \"It was a long and interesting debate on open meetings,\" she said. \"I hadn't realized the force of opposition.\" In fact, she said, there was much to learn when she made the transition from full-time homemaker to legislator in January 1973.She made an almost snap decision to run for the DFL endorsement after her friend, the local Independent-Republican chair of theLeague of Women Voters, was not endorsed by that party. \"I ended up reading her speech at the DFL endorsement convention with the word Re- publican crossed out and DFL penciled in,\" she recalled. \"Then I called another friendwho had been on vacation and said, 'Guess what I decided to do while you were away?'\" And although Growe went on to win the House seat in a district that was 70 percent Republican, it was her gender that grabbed attention. \"The attention was unmistakable,\" she said. \"And it could be to your advantage because the minute a woman started to speakin the chamber, it would grow quiet and the cameras would focus. But of course if you failed, you were that much more visible.\"Growe steps from one House termto six terms as secretary of state She ran for secretary of state during her second year in the House, and took office in January 1975 as Minnesota's first woman tobe elected to statewide office without having been appointed first. She found her new office to be a different world from the Legislature. \"I missed some of that camaraderie at first,\" she said. \"And to a degree, I missedthe wide range of issues that you deal with as a legislator.\" She got right to work as secretary of state, implementing the election-day voter regis- tration law, passed by the Legislature while Growe was a member. \"I also came in with some things I wanted to see changed,\" she said. She pushed for simplified absentee voting procedures and helped secure mail-in bal- loting for many areas of the state. She also oversaw Minnesota's pioneering motor-voter law \u2014 allowing people to reg- ister to vote while licensing their vehicle \u2014 and testified before Congress when the fed-eral equivalent was being put together. And she has lent her expertise interna- tionally as well, serving as an election ob-server twice in Romania and, through the United Nations, once in South Africa dur- ing that country's first democratic election,in 1994. Growe will step down as secretary of state at the end of this year, and she intends tofocus on two things once she leaves office: stepping up her involvement in promoting democracy internationally and spendingmore time with her grandchildren. She has three granddaughters and pre- dicts that her fourth grandchild, due in May,will also be a girl because \"we don't do boys.\" Joan Anderson Growe, Minnesota's longtime secretary of state, got her start in the House in the early 1970s. She will retire at the end ofthis year after six terms in her current job. continued on page 155 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 26 - March 5, 1998 BANKING BONDINGBUDGET Lost or stolen debit cards A bill that would limit customer liability to $50 on lost or stolen debit cards passed theHouse March 2. The vote was 132-0. HF2500 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), covers the debit cards thatfinancial institutions issue to holders of check-ing accounts. Besides getting cash out of automatic teller machines, consumers can use debit cards tomake purchases that are directly deductedfrom their checking account, as long as themerchant has a terminal that can handle debitcard transactions. Rest's bill would limit customer liability to $50 if the card is lost or stolen. The limit wouldapply to unauthorized transactions made be-fore the bank receives notice that the card hasbeen lost or stolen. (There is no liability fortransactions made after the financial institu-tion has been notified.) A similar liability limit for credit card hold- ers exists in current law. The bill now goes to the Senate. Gov. Arne Carlson announces Feb. 27 that the most recent revenue forecastshows an additional $592 million in projected surplus funds, pushing the totalforecast surplus to $1.9 billion.Speaker Phil Carruthers and Majority Leader Ted Winter, left, announce a proposal to use part of the state's projected billion surplus to fund anotherproperty tax rebate that could go to homeowners and renters this fall.Mechanism for coordination A proposal to create a commission which would coordinate statewide convention andcivic centers was debated by the House CapitalInvestment Committee March 4.Sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), the proposal was laid over and could beincluded as an amendment to this year's bond-ing bill. Trimble told the committee that with the proliferation of convention center bondingrequests this year, there should be some mecha-nism for coordination. \"I want to maximize the amount of planning to get people competing with those facilities outof state, not with facilities in state,\" Trimble said.\"It kind of makes sense that we don't want ourfacilities undercutting each other.\" Currently, the House Capital Investment Committee is reviewing several bonding re-quests for convention and civic centers, in-cluding the Minneapolis Convention Center,the St. Paul RiverCentre, and facilities in De-troit Lakes, Duluth, Fergus Falls, Hutchinson,Lake Crystal, Rochester, St. Cloud, andWindom. Trimble's proposal would call for a com- mission made up of two state representatives,two state senators, representatives from eachof the facilities, and a chair selected by thegovernor. The commissioner of the Depart-ment of Trade and Economic Developmentalso would serve in an advisory role on thecommission. The commission would be responsible for development, marketing, and coordinatedplanning for the state's public conventionfacilities. All facilities receiving state funding would be required to work with the commission.Other facilities would be encouraged toparticipate.Projected budget surplus Gov. Arne Carlson and the House DFL lead- ership agree that much of the projected $1.9billion budget surplus announced Feb. 27should go back to taxpayers \u2014 they just differon how much should go back and how andwhen it should be done. \"The economic growth in Minnesota con- tinues to be strong,\" Carlson said during apress conference in his Capitol office. \"It is myprayer that we can return the vast majority ofthese dollars to the people of Minnesota.\" The latest economic release by the finance department shows an additional $592 millionin surplus state money, thus bringing the en-tire state budget surplus for this biennium to$1.9 billion. The projected surplus is duemainly to higher-than-expected tax receiptsand lower spending, according to thegovernor. Carlson wants $250 million of that budget surplus to go to increase the property taxrebate for homeowners and renters, $230 mil-lion to an income tax reduction account, and$6 million to tax credits for education ex-penses. The governor's plan would contribute 60 percent of any surplus shown in the Novem-ber 1998 economic forecast to the income taxreduction account. Carlson also wants to increase the size of his proposed Asian market reserve account from$207 million to $400 million. \"No one can say with any certainty what6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998DEVELOPMENTimpact the Asian crisis will have on the economy in Minnesota,\" he said. If the November 1998 forecast shows sus- tained growth, the Asian reserve account wouldbe dissolved, with $90 million to go to schools,$250 million to complete that property taxrebate, and $60 million to the reserve account. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) agreed with much of whatthe governor said, but Carruthers said duringa Feb. 27 press conference that his caucushopes to go beyond the governor's plans. Carruthers described a proposal to provide a \"no wait rebate,\" an extra property tax rebatethat homeowners and renters would get inOctober 1998. \"We want the families of Minnesota to get the checks as soon as possible,\" Carrutherssaid. The October rebate would be in addition to the August refund checks normally paid tohomeowners and renters. Taxpayers who getthe August check would automatically get theOctober check, so no further paperwork wouldbe needed. Of the $592 million in additional projected surplus funds, Carruthers and others in theHouse majority caucus leadership want $345million to go for property tax relief ($250million for the October rebate and $95 millionin permanent tax reductions), $60 million forK-12 education, and $100 million for trans-portation infrastructure, which would includeroads and bridges and light or commuter rail.The DFL leaders are also calling for $13 mil-lion for nursing homes, $5 million for hous-ing, and $17 million for the reserve account. Carruthers said the DFL plans are based on priorities described by constituents: propertytax cuts, education, and transportation. \"In many areas we agree with the governor. We like the property tax rebate; we think itshould be speeded up,\" he said. Economic development, housing The omnibus jobs, housing, and economic development bill survived an onslaught ofproposed amendments related to the \"healthyhomes\" provisions and was approved by thefull House March 4. The vote was 74-57. Sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), the bill ( HF3806/SF3367* ) combines most of the initiatives heard by the HouseEconomic Development and InternationalTrade Committee's Economic DevelopmentFinance Division and the Housing and Hous-ing Finance Division.The bill includes $15 million in appropria- tions going to state agencies to promote state-wide economic development and job trainingand $15 million in funding for housingprograms. The \"healthy homes\" sections of the bill received the most scrutiny on the floor. Rep.Geri Evans (DFL-New Brighton), the originalsponsor of the provisions, offered one of thetwo amendments finally adopted. Evans' amendment removed some of the proposed increases to new home warrantyperiods, which give homeowners time to findout about defective conditions, and addedprovisions requiring builders to notify homebuyers of current warranty periods. Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), who works as a construction consultant, amended the bill toreduce the number of continuing educationhours required for builders in the initialproposal. Other provisions of the original \"healthy homes\" bill remain in the omnibus bill, in-cluding training requirements for builders andinspectors and the extension of some of thewarranty periods for new homes. The most controversial policy provision of the original bill was removed by the full Eco-nomic Development and International TradeCommittee before the omnibus bill went tothe floor. The provision called for all newhomes built after March 1, 1999, to have me-chanical ventilation systems. Opponents of the \"healthy homes\" provi- sions argued that these new requirements putundue burden on the building industry, whichis already responding to consumer concernsregarding home safety and quality. Here are some other highlights of the omni- bus jobs, housing, and economic develop-ment bill. Hollywood, Minn. The largest appropriation contained in the bill would go to the Minnesota Film Board toprovide support for the state's $250 millionfilm and video industry. The $5 million appropriation, which was part of the governor's supplemental budgetrecommendations, would create a revolvingloan film fund to be administered by the filmboard and the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development. The fund would provide loans ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 to film and televisionproducers for Minnesota projects. The stateloan funds could account for up to 50 percentof the production budget. The loan agreementwould require the producer to spend 120 per-cent of the loan amount in the state. The film board expects that 20 projects will be initiated in the state during the first fewyears of the program. Currently, eight na- tional cable television series are produced inthe state, and 55 feature films have been madein Minnesota since 1990, according to theboard. Economic development Including the aforementioned film board appropriation, funding for the Department ofTrade and Economic Development \u2014 a totalof $7.5 million \u2014 makes up a quarter of thespending called for in the entire bill. The department would receive $1 million in additional funding for the Office of Tourism.Part of the governor's request, the moneywould be used to supplement advertising toattract tourists to Minnesota. The remaining portion would fund eco- nomic development projects throughout thestate. One provision did not survive the house floor. A $285,000 proposal for a trolley serviceconnecting the Minneapolis Convention Cen-ter with cultural tourist attractions in southMinneapolis neighborhoods was removedfrom the bill. Boosting employment Under the omnibus bill, the Department of Economic Security would receive $5 millionto fund job training and re-employment pro-grams. The department would acquire $250,000 to develop programs that encourage women tohold nontraditional occupations. The agencywould develop programs to educate and trainwomen for technical careers that, historically,have not been open to them. The Department of Economic Security would receive $1.4 million targeted at jobtraining for youth. The department also wouldreceive $1 million for their rehabilitative ser-vices, which provides job training to peoplewith disabilities. The department would also receive $1.4 million for the State Services for the Blind.The funds would be used to develop a digitalcommunication center for its Radio TalkingBook program. The program broadcasts lit-erature over special radio frequencies that canbe accessed by special receivers. History and tourism The omnibus bill would appropriate $1 million to the Minnesota Historical Societyand $735,000 to the Department of Adminis-tration to fund a wide range of projects state-wide. Of these funds, $300,000 would go to fi- nance the development of a conference centerin Little Falls, $185,000 would fund improve-ments to Montevideo's historic railroad de-7 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYGOVERNMENTpot, and $100,000 would finance rehabilita- tion on the Lake Superior and MississippiRailroad outside of Duluth. Employment contracts The omnibus bill also includes compromise language from a bill that initially called for allemployers to disclose the terms of employ-ment in writing in each employee's first lan-guage. The current bill would require only that the Department of Labor and Industry develop abrochure stating employee rights and listingemployee resource phone numbers. The provision also would require employ- ers to provide the brochure when an employeeis first offered a job, and the bill would providepenalties for employers who fail to do so. Saving subsidized housing A provision that would provide $10 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency(MHFA) to assist in maintaining existing low-income housing is the centerpiece of the $15million housing portion of the bill. The proposed $10 million appropriation to protect existing affordable housing was workedon by legislators during the interim and wasincorporated into the governor's budget rec-ommendations. The provision comes in re-sponse to a situation occurring statewide. In the 1970s, the federal government set up a program where developers received reduced-rate mortgages and financing incentives tobuild low- and moderate-income housing.Rent rates were subsidized by the federal gov-ernment and rent increases were regulated. Owners of many such complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allowsthem to prepay the remaining portion of theirmortgage and to begin charging market-raterent. Housing advocates say that this scenario could happen at the over 300 apartment com-plexes throughout the state that were financedthrough the federal program. The $10 million in the bill would fund the equity takeout loan program administered bythe MHFA. The fund is used to provide finan-cial incentives to maintain existing subsidizedhousing. The incentives can be made availableto local units of government and nonprofitorganizations. Other housing help The bill would allocate $1.6 million to the MHFA to be used for current programs thatfinance the construction of new multifamilyrental housing. The funds would be used incollaboration with federal dollars to build af-fordable rental housing.Another provision would appropriate $1.1 million to homelessness prevention programsadministered by the MHFA. Of this, $365,000would go to the Bridges Program, which pro-vides rental assistance to people with disabili-ties. Programs that assist home ownership would receive $2.2 million, under the bill. That sumwould include $1.6 million to the CommunityRehabilitation Fund for the production ofaffordable single-family housing and $500,000for home ownership zones to encourage own-ership in distressed areas. The bill would also provide $200,000 to fund programs seeking to make Minnesotahomes healthier. Of that amount, $75,000would fund a program that would providegrants to people who suffer from MultipleChemical Sensitivity. The grants would beused to finance improvements to make thehomes chemically free. State government finance bill The budget of the Office of the Attorney General and its role in the state's tobaccolawsuit remained intact after the House passedan omnibus state government finance billMarch 4. Other controversial provisions including a stepped-up community-based planning advi-sory council and a directive to the Metropoli-tan Sports Facilities Commission concerningstadium leases also remained in thebill( HF3137/SF3354* ), which is sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia). The billpassed 70-61. But a provision that would have increased advertising for the state lottery got the thumbsdown from lawmakers. Here's a look at the $32.8 million House version of the state government spending bill,which now goes to a conference committee. Funding the attorney general The bill provides $24 million in operating expenses for the attorney general's fiscal year1999, which begins July 1. That's $441,000 less than the office re- quested, but $1.5 million more than Gov.Arne Carlson recommended. Last year,Carlson used his line-item veto authority tostrike the funding, cit-ing \"unnecessary, imprudent, and unaccept-able growth\" in the office. The attorney general is responsible for as- serting and defending the state's legal inter-ests, settling claims involving the public andprivate sectors, and aiding other law-enforce-ment agencies in prosecuting and solving cases. A Republican-backed amendment that would have cut another $1.5 million from thebudget failed on the House floor. Supportersof the amendment said that amount wasslipped into the office's base budget after be-ing approved in 1996 as a one-time appropria-tion to upgrade information systems. Also failing was an amendment offered by Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) thatwould have directed all profits from a poten-tial settlement or jury award in the state'scourt battle with tobacco companies to a spe-cial account for tax relief. The bill also includes a call for a task force to evaluate the availability, effectiveness, and costof legal services provided by the office. Lottery advertising House members voted against expanding lottery advertising as part of the governmentfinance bill. A separate bill ( HF3104 ) sponsored by Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington) had beenrolled into in the omnibus bill by the HouseWays and Means Committee, but the plan wasdeleted on the House floor. The proposal would have increased the amount of revenue the lottery is allowed tospend on advertising and permitted holiday-themed ads. But another amendment, which would have all but eliminated lottery advertising, failed togarner enough support from lawmakers. Community-based planning A controversial plan to expand a state advi- sory council on community-based planninghas withstood several attempts to remove itfrom the omnibus bill. The plan was originally proposed in a sepa- rate bill ( HF3609 ), sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls). It would expand member-ship on an existing advisory council as well asextend the life of the council for six monthsuntil Dec. 31, 1998. It would not provideadditional funding for the council. The council's purpose is to set up voluntary land-use planning projects between state andlocal government units. But many Greater Minnesota lawmakers say that idea scares them for one reason: Theydon't believe it will remain voluntary for long. \"Sure, now it's voluntary, but we've heard that with every other project that soon becamemandatory,\" said Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-LakeCity). Osskopp introduced an amendment on the House floor that would have asserted thatprivate-property rights would be respected bythe advisory council. But that amendment failed, as did one by8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998 Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township) that would have eliminated the six-monthextension of the council. Baseball leases A contested baseball provision is back in the omnibus bill approved by the House. Saying they were sick and tired of baseball- related issues, members of the House Govern-mental Operations Committee had earlierstruck a six-line section that would have pro-hibited the Metropolitan Sports FacilitiesCommission from signing any future leasewith a professional baseball team for less thanseven years. But the section was re-instated by the Ways and Means Committee Feb. 27, and an amend-ment to remove it failed on the House floor. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) spoke in favor of the proposal, saying it would send amessage to major-league baseball. \"When the Twins canceled their lease early, they threw a hardball into the process,\" shesaid. \"We're picking up that hardball and send-ing it back to them.\" State spending Several other funding provisions remained intact when the House passed SF3354 , includ- ing: $3.85 million to help update state computer systems to address problems associated withthe advent of the year 2000; $1.2 million for the first year of a two-year study on large animal feedlots; $500,000 in grants to public television sta- tions to help them convert to a digital broad-casting signal, as mandated by the federalgovernment; $315,000 to Pioneer Public Television to build a tower in Otter Tail County. That areais currently the only part of the state thatcannot receive a public television signal; $100,000 for Minneapolis and St. Paul to develop computer facilities in public parksfor low-income residents; $44,000 to make the state register and guide- book to state agencies available on theInternet free of charge; $25,000 for the Council of State Govern- ments to set up meetings between Minne-sota legislators and members of the Manitobaand Ontario parliaments to discuss bound-ary disputes; and $20,000 to install a portrait of Gov. Arne Carlson in the Capitol. Eleven-month-old Tommy Workman takes a break from playing with his toy trucks during a visitto the House chamber with his father, Rep.

Effective Feb. 26, 1998, a new state law allows state designation of rural nonprofit orpublic hospitals and facilities as \"critical toaccess.\" Such facilities can be certified by thestate as necessary providers of health careservices to residents in the area. Necessary providers can be those 20 miles from the nearest hospital, those that are thesole hospital in a county, or those that meetcertain federal criteria. There is the potential for 39 such hospitals in the state to receive the special designation. Under federal law, critical access hospitals receive enhanced reimbursement and regula-tory flexibility in exchange for limiting theirinpatient services while maintaining emer-gency medical services. A study by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, part of the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, indi-cates traumatic injuries are more common inrural areas. Rural areas also have a larger per-centage of elderly people than urban areas andhigher poverty rates, according to the agency. The small, rural hospitals designated as \"critical access\" facilities will retain patientsonly for a limited time, but the hospitals willbe able to arrange for transfers and referralswhen longer hospitals stays are required.The bill was the first introduced by Rep. Mary Ellen Ottremba (DFL-Long Prairie), whowon a special election last fall to replace herlate husband, Ken. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the legislation in the Senate. The new law also calls for the development of a rural health plan within the current levelof funding. HF2550*/SF2261/CH257 HOUSINGSigned by the governor Tenant security deposits A new law, effective Aug. 1, 1998,would extend the current interestrate paid by property owners ontenant security deposits. Current law sets the rate at 3 percent until 1999, and after that time the rate was to be increased to 4 percent.The rate increase was supposed to parallel anincrease in interest rates generally; however,interest rates have remained low. Property owners said that after 1999 they would be paying a higher rate to hold depositfunds than most financial institutions wouldpay. The new law would change the date of the increase to 4 percent from May 1, 1999, to May1, 2001. The new law, sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. James Metzen(DFL-South St. Paul), was signed by the gov-ernor March 4. HF2590*/SF2122/CH266Signed by the governor9 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYHUMAN SERVICES Health, human services bill Salaries for employees at nursing homes in Minnesota would rise 4.25 percent as part of a$59.7 million health and human services om-nibus bill advancing in the House. The price tag on the wage increase would be $12.6 million dollars, and it was not part of thegovernor's budget proposal. The bill ( HF2868/SF3346* ) also includes food assistance for legal immigrants, funds fora Fetal Alcohol Syndrome public awarenessprogram, and measures related to partial birthabortions. The bill, sponsored by Lee Greenfield (DFL- Mpls), is on its way to the House floor. The nursing home spending is part of an effort to stabilize the workforce at nursingfacilities. Low wages among most nursinghome employees, coupled with bountiful jobopportunities in other fields in the currentbooming economy, have made it difficult fornursing homes to attract and keep workers. The omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 1999 reflects reduced caseloads and expensesthat resulted in $129 million returned to thegeneral fund from the Department of HumanServices. The caseload for long-term care isdown 5 percent, for example. Cost andcaseloads for the elderly and disabled andthose on Medical Assistance are also down. Another crucial element of the spending portion of the bill that cleared the House Waysand Means Committee March 2 includes $10million that would create statewide unifor-mity in child protective services. Minnesota isone of 10 states in which child protectiveservices are provided by the county ratherthan the state. It has been determined that these services currently vary widely among the counties. Another element of the bill would address legal immigrants who were eliminated fromthe federal food stamp program in September1997. Nearly $9 million would establish a state- funded program for these noncitizens whowould otherwise no longer be eligible for foodstamp benefits and the Minnesota Food Assis-tance program. This was also not part of thegovernor's recommendation. Also in the funding bill is $3.5 million that would be allocated to establish Fetal AlcoholSyndrome prevention, intervention, and educa-tion initiatives, an issue that has been deeplysupported by Minnesota first lady Susan Carlson. The governor's total spending proposal for health and human services was just under$31.7 million for fiscal 1999, but Carlson'splan did not include the nursing home wage increase. Another $13.7 million not in thegovernor's budget would cover the funding ofbattered women's shelters. In fiscal year 1999, the authority to pay per diem costs for the shelters was to transfer fromthe General Assistance program to theDepartment of Corrections, under thegovernor's recommendations. But under theHouse bill, the expense would not transfer.(General Assistance is a state program thatoffers help to those in poverty who do notqualify for other state or federal welfare pro-grams.) Nursing homes The state pays nursing homes a per diem for each resident based on location, property costsand taxes, case mix, and other operating costs.Case mix is determined by the extent of careneeded for each patient. Under the bill, the per diem for salaries would rise 4.25 percent, with the appropriatedmoney to pay nursing home workers whoprovide direct care to patients, perform house-keeping, and handle other nonadministrativeduties. Greenfield, chair of the Health and Human Services Finance Division, told the Ways andMeans Committee March 2 that nursing homes\"are having a great deal of difficulty attractingand keeping qualified staff, and part of our jobas state representatives is to help with thatproblem.\" Nursing home workers have testified to leg- islators this session that their work is emo-tionally stressful and often leads tooccupation-related injuries such as back prob-lems, the result of lifting patients. Legislators were also told that understaffing leads to distress for patients and problems thatinclude malnutrition, which can result frominsufficient staff to handle all patients at mealtimes. The increase in the per diem rate would take effect July 1, 1998. The bill also would direct the commissioner of human services, in discussions with nurs-ing homes and other affected parties, to imple-ment a performance-based system by July 1,2000, to replace the current method of settingthe per diem operating cost payments. It wouldalso direct the commissioner to implement aperformance-based system at intermediatecare facilities for mental retardation. Help for legal noncitizens At the beginning of the session, Greenfield said during a committee hearing, \"I think italways was the legislative intent to address thefood stamp issue.\" The omnibus bill does justthat.Nearly $5 million would be used to create the Minnesota Food Assistance Program. Asof July 1, 1998, the program would providefood assistance to legal noncitizens not onMinnesota Family Investment Plan-Statewide(MFIP-S), which allows families to acceptlower-paying jobs and receive some state aidwhile working toward the goal of getting offpublic assistance. Those entering the one-year food assistance program would have to meet all other eligibil-ity requirements for the federal food stampprogram. The federal Welfare Reform Act of 1996 made noncitizens ineligible for the federalfood stamp program, but the federal 1997Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Actgives states the option to purchase food stampbenefits for those who are ineligible becausethey are not citizens. That option requires states to pay for the value of the food stamp benefits, plus thefederal government's cost for providing theoption. Counties would use the same income, bud- geting, and benefit allotment regulations forthe state program as for the federal food stampprogram. Twelve other states currently provide simi- lar assistance. Another nearly $3.8 million would help extend the food supplement to legal nonciti-zen families on MFIP-S, the state's main wel-fare reform initiative. A cash benefit equal to $63 a month, which was designated to replace the value of the foodstamps lost when noncitizens became ineli-gible for the federal food stamp program, wasscheduled to end June 30, 1998. This bill wouldextend the benefit and also make eligible legalnoncitizen families who are on MFIP-S, re-gardless of whether they became state resi-dents as of July 1, 1997, as current law stipulates. It is estimated about 4,700 legal noncitizens are eligible for this program, and another 500noncitizens annually would lose eligibility forfederal food stamps and shift onto this plan. A third food program provision included in the bill would set aside a little over $4 millionfor fiscal year 1999 to include food stamp costof living increases in the food portion of theMFIP-S grants and to fund other modifica-tions to MFIP-S. The 1997 Legislature reduced the food por- tion of the MFIP-S grant by $30 for house-holds receiving public housing subsidies. Thefull $30 reduction does not comply with thefederal food stamp regulations. Food stampregulations would permit only a $10 monthlyreduction. The omnibus bill would authorize $2.3 mil- lion to buy back this $10 of the $30 reduction10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998per household. About $1.75 million would go toward the cost of living increase. Partial birth abortions The bill would make a person who know- ingly performs a partial-birth abortion guiltyof a felony that carries a sentence of not morethan 15 years or payment of a fine of not morethan $50,000. A partial-birth abortion is one in which the fetus is killed after being partially delivered. The prohibition would not apply to a par- tial-birth abortion that is performed as a lastresort to save the life of the mother becauseher life was endangered by a health condition,including a life-threatening condition arisingfrom the pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a series of birth defects that can result from alcohol consump-tion during pregnancy. The Journal of theAmerican Medical Association reports FetalAlcohol Syndrome is the leading known causeof mental retardation. Susan Carlson was co-chair of the Governor's Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syn-drome, which estimated the disease costs Min-nesota taxpayers at least $45 million annuallyin health, judicial, and social services costs. The $3.5 million included the House fund- ing bill is $1.5 million less than the governor'srequest for this program. A total of $500,000 would help the commis- sioner of human services expand the maternaland child health social services program, and$600,000 would help to implement a publicawareness campaign. Another $300,000 would be used to develop a statewide network of regional Fetal AlcoholSyndrome diagnostic clinics. The legislationdesignates $150,000 to help train health careproviders. According to the National Organi-zation on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, less than10 percent of medical schools require comple-tion of a course on diagnosis. The launching of a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome coordinating board would use another$200,000. The board would review and coor-dinate existing state programs and integratestate and local prevention and interventionprograms. It would report to the governorbiennially. A total of $700,000 of the remaining funds is for a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome communitygrant program. The commissioner of healthwould administer the program to fund workby community organizations on preventionand intervention of the syndrome.Child protective services In January 1998, the legislative auditor found that child protective services varied widelyamong Minnesota's 87 counties and that noexternal evaluation of cases exists. The auditorsuggested the system be reformed. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored a bill ( HF2985 ) that would work to create consistency in child protection investi-gations statewide, focus on the prevention ofchild abuse and neglect, and implement sev-eral other auditor's recommendations. Earlier this session, the House Health and Human Services Committee approved thepolicy part of the bill, which awaits action onthe House floor. Greenfield's finance divisionapproved a $10 million appropriation for thechild protection initiatives, and that amountis now in the omnibus bill. The governor also called for $10 million for child welfare services in his budget. The money for child protection would be transferred from the state's federal Tempo-rary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)block grant to the state's Federal Title XXblock grant, which provides grants to statesfor social services. The state, in turn, passes themoney to the counties for community socialservices. Federal law permits states to transfer speci- fied percentages of their TANF block grant toTitle XX, and to the state's childhood develop-ment fund. The TANF block grant replaced the Aid to Families with the Dependent Children(AFDC), Emergency Assistance, and Job Op-portunities and Basis Skills (JOBS) programs.Each state is guaranteed a share of TANF funds, which may be used for any purposeauthorized under AFDC or JOBS programs.Specified purposes include cash assistance,child care, educational activities designed toincrease self-sufficiency, job training, and workactivities. Consumer health assistance If you can't get referred to a chiropractor under your current health plan, where do youturn? Minnesota health plan companies andhealth care professionals are governed by morethan 20 boards and oversight bodies. People confused or unhappy about their health plan would have a one-stop place tocall, under a $200,000 provision in the bill thatwould go to establish an office of health careconsumer assistance. The office would have no regulatory power, but it would have a broad range of duties. Itwould assist consumers who have complaintsor questions about their health plan or healthcare provider. It would also help them under-stand their legal rights and get appropriatehealth care referrals. The governor would appoint an executive director, and the office would have at leastnine consumer advocates to perform the du-ties of the office. The original bill ( HF2649 ), sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls), requested$700,000 for the program. There was no bud-get recommendation on this from the gover-nor. Preceding this legislation was a 1997 state law, the Patient Protection Act, which aimed Kay Smith, principal at Parkview Center School in Roseville, reads a Dr. Seuss book to some ofher first and second graders in the Capitol rotunda March 2 to celebrate reading and torecognize the 94th anniversary of Dr. Seuss' birth. More than 260 schools around the stateparticipated in the daylong event to promote reading with children.Rotunda read-a-thon11 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYto prevent health plan companies from inter- fering with the medical professional-patientrelationship, and to provide patients with ac-curate information about their health planand health plan companies. Welfare to work Under Minnesota's traditional welfare pro- gram, a family left welfare when its incomereached 85 percent of the poverty level. Somestate officials said that too often discouragedpeople on welfare from getting a job, becausefamilies who worked had the income deductedfrom their welfare check. Under the new MFIP-S employment and training program, welfare recipients are to beevaluated and put into a job search or pro-vided with education and training, if neces-sary, and moved into the workforce quickly. But the argument was made before and among legislators this year that pushing someMFIP-S recipients toward low-paying jobs wasin the long run hurting the state and someindividuals. Testimony heard this session depicted nu- merous situations in which people nearingcompletion of postsecondary degrees thatwould lead to jobs paying a livable wage weretold to quit school and find employment orlose state benefits. Part of the omnibus bill would allow those within 12 months of attaining a degree, or 18months if remedial education is needed, toretain benefits while continuing theireducation. Job counselors would emphasize the educa- tion and training opportunities available \u2014an emphasis determined to be inconsistentstatewide \u2014 and decide if a lack of proficiencyin English is an employment barrier. If it is, anEnglish as a second language program wouldhave to be in the participant's employmentplan as long as the participant makes satisfac-tory progress and the lack of proficiency is acontinued employment barrier. The cost of the change would be just under $1.1 million, with another $400,000 requestedfor child care services. Another change would require that each participant's language and math skills be as-sessed. If a participant has basic math skills ator below the eighth-grade level, the personwould be allowed to enroll in adult basic edu-cation as part of the job search.INDUSTRY Industrial hygiene, safety People hired to make work environments safer would need to meet certain require-ments if they wish to use titles such as \"indus-trial hygienist,\" under a bill that passed theHouse March 2. The vote was 110-21. Sponsored by Rep. Alice Seagren (R- Bloomington), the bill would provide legalrecognition to the industrial hygiene and safetyprofession, and would prevent individuals whohave not met certain requirements from usingspecific titles. Organizations for industrial hygienists \u2014 who work to control workplace environmen-tal factors that may cause illness \u2014 have beenaround for at least 60 years. But it is a field thathas received increasing attention in recentyears. The bill ( HF668 ) would prescribe the con- ditions under which a person can use the titlesof industrial hygienist, industrial hygienist intraining, certified industrial hygienist, certi-fied safety professional, associate safety pro-fessional, or construction health and safetytechnologist. Two states have adopted similar legislation, and it is being considered in four others, ac-cording to the American Society of SafetyEngineers (ASSE). Anyone practicing industrial hygiene would not be allowed to use the professional titleslisted above unless he or she attended an ac-credited college or university and receivedthe proper certification, under Seagren's bill.A certified industrial hygienist, for instance,would have to pass a test by the nonprofitAmerican Board of Industrial Hygiene andmaintain that license in order to use the title. Individuals would also have to meet certain work experience conditions. The ASSE, founded in 1911, claims as little as $225 can buy a lifetime certification con-taining the titles the legislation would protect.The ASSE also argues there are other groupswho supply documentation and photo identi-fication containing these titles, but the groupsrequire no experience or education. More stringent accrediting organizations, such as the Board of Certified Safety Profes-sionals, require testing and scheduled recerti-fication. This board has found instances ofindividuals falsely using their title designa-tions. The restrictions would not apply to prop- erly supervised apprentices, or those employedby the state of Minnesota. It was argued thatemployees of the state are already subject tostringent standards, and it would be onerousto place another stipulation upon them. The bill now moves to the Senate.

The measure be- came law without the governor's signatureMarch 5. A NATO expansion to include the three countries is anticipated in April 1999, pendingU. S. approval. President Clinton supports theexpansion and the U.S. Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee approved a measureMarch 3 calling for admitting the three formerSoviet-bloc nations to the international peace-keeping organization. Within the next few weeks, the issue is ex- pected to come before the full U.S. Senate,where a three-quarters majority is needed toapprove the resolution. The Minnesota proposal was originally sponsored by Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth),who spent about two months translating forNATO troops in northeastern Bosnia last sum-mer. \"My idea is that every country should join NATO, and then once everybody is joined insupport of peace, we won't need any morearmies,\" he said. Sen. Larry Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) sored the measure in the Senate. HF2417 */SF2055/Res.5 TAXESSigned by the governor Omnibus tax bill A plan to provide a new property tax rebate in October 1998 is included in the early ver-sion of the omnibus tax bill, discussed March4 by the House Taxes Committee. The Taxes Committee is expected to ap- prove the omnibus bill in time for the legisla-tion to go the House floor before mid-March. With the state's projected budget surplus of $1.9 billion, the current incarnation of the billincludes several provisions for either tax cutsor tax rebates. Other provisions in the bill would provide an expanded senior citizens' property tax de-ferral program, cuts in sales, and additionalfunds for the state's budget reserve. Most provisions in the 200-page bill have12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998had hearings in the committee's Property Tax and Tax Increment Division or Sales and In-come Tax Division this session, and mostproposals were forwarded to the full commit-tee without recommendation. Under the bill, homeowners and renters would get a rebate next year equal to 20 per-cent of their property taxes paid in 1998, up toa maximum of $1,500. Current law providessuch a rebate on property taxes paid in 1997,except there is no maximum on the amount ofthe rebate. The bill also calls for homeowners and rent- ers to get an additional rebate in October 1998equaling 50 percent of the rebate they receivedon property taxes paid in 1997, up to a maxi-mum of $750. The bill also includes some permanent prop- erty tax reform measures. The bill would in-crease the top value of homes in the firstproperty tax tier \u2014 taxed at the lowest rate \u2014from $75,000 to $78,000 by 2001. Also, the taxrate the second tier of residential propertywould fall from 1.85 percent to 1.7 percent by2001. Property taxes on farms also would be de- creased. The tax on the first $115,000 of suchproperty would go from 0.4 percent to 0.35percent by 2001. The rate on the value inexcess of $115,000 would go from the current0.9 percent to 0.8 percent by 2001. Property tax rates also would be cut for commercial and industrial property and apart-ment buildings. Under the bill, senior citizens with an an- nual income of up to $40,000 would qualifyfor the senior property tax deferral program.Current law allows only those with an incomeup to $30,000. Some sales taxes also would be reduced. The sales tax on farm machinery, logging equip-ment, and \"aqua culture\" production equip-ment would go from 2.5 percent to 1.5 percentin 1998. Sales tax on these items would beeliminated in 1999. Public libraries would see sales taxes elimi- nated on all their purchases. Finally, the bill would increase the state's budget reserve to $582 million. It's now at$522 million. The Taxes Committee heard testimony on the bill March 5, and was to begin takingamendments from members March 6. The billis expected get to the House floor sometimeduring the week of March 9. That's more like it A week after near record high temperatureswere reached, winter returned to the Capitolwith snow and temperatures moreappropriate for early March.TRANSPORTATION Sirens and flashing red lights A new law signed by the governorMarch 4 will reinstate a safety re-quirement for ambulances. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law will require all medical emer-gency vehicles to both sound an audible signal and activate red emergency lightswhile responding to emergencies. Medicalvehicles that are transporting patients in non-emergency situations will not be required tosound their alarms. Last session, legislation to exempt law en- forcement officers from the requirement tosound audible signals while responding toemergency calls included language that alsoexempted emergency medical vehicles. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), House sponsor of the new measure, said that after the1997 law was approved, insurance carriersbegan telling owners of emergency medicalvehicles that rates for coverage would rise ifboth audible and visible signals were not usedwhile responding to emergencies. Proponents argued that it is safer for ambu- lance drivers, other motorists, and pedestri-ans to have the audible warning in addition toflashing red lights.Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2576/SF2028*/CH263 Signed by the governorVETERANS Gulf War veterans' bonuses A new law effective Feb. 26 allowsthe state's Department of VeteransAffairs to consider documentsother than a veteran's military dis-charge form in determining anapplicant's eligibility for a state bonus program for Persian Gulf Warveterans. In 1997, the Legislature passed a law setting aside $17 million to give Minnesota's approxi-mately 44,000 Persian Gulf War veterans abonus for their military service in Desert Storm.Veterans receive bonuses at three levels:Approximately 13,000 who served within awar zone are eligible to get $600. Another30,500 who were preparing to be shipped over-seas can get $300, and the families of the nineMinnesota soldiers killed in the war each areeligible for $2,000. Problems arose when the process used by the veterans affairs department to determineeligibility was causing benefit delays of up tosix months. Under the new law, the department can use \u2014 in the place of military discharge forms \u2014other reliable documentation proving mili-tary service. The documents must be approvedby the department. Minnesota veterans who served in the mili- tary between Aug. 2, 1990, and July 31, 1991,are eligible. Applications will be accepted un-til June 30, 1999, and are available throughgroups such as the American Legion and theVeterans of Foreign Wars. Chief sponsors of the legislation were Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) and Sen. JimMetzen (DFL-South St. Paul). HF2338*/SF2167/CH258Signed by the governor Need a copy of a bill? Call the Chief Clerk's Office at (612) 296-231413 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Matt Wetzel When Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington) first ran for theHouse, he spoke in favor of termlimits and vowed he would serveno more than four terms. Now, as he eyes an opportunity to run for state treasurer, Knight has announced he willstep down after just three terms. And he'salready talking about what kind of state trea-surer he would be. \"I'd like to take my own approach to invest- ment issues and make that standard,\" Knightsaid. \"I have a strong interest in the pensionsystem.\" The state treasurer receives and issues re- ceipts for all payments to the treasury andcontrols money held in state bank accounts.The office maintains records, provides ac-counting services, and directs principal andinterest payments on bond accounts and cer-tificates of indebtedness. The thing that the 40-year-old Chicago na- tive is most proud of from his legislative careeris his work to protect the state's financial well-being. \"Myself and others have brought a perspec- tive on things relating to spending and broughta firm hand to the bottom line,\" he said. In 1995, he and some other legislators, known as the \"fiscal conservative caucus,\"worked to suggest reductions in state spend-ing. The result was a report published in Janu-ary 1996 that laid out specificrecommendations for spending cuts. \"We found that $1 billion of the spending [during that biennium) was classified as waste-ful spending,\" he said. However, few of thegroup's suggestions were adopted. Notable legislation that Knight helped spon- sor includes a 1997 \"corporate welfare\" mea-sure calling for the formation of a commissionto study incentives given to corporations bycities to attract them and their jobs. Knight said he was struck by the irony that in every year since 1988, the Legislature haddone something to help reform welfare. Butnothing had been done about \"corporate wel-fare,\" which Knight defines as \"the unequaldistribution of money and benefits to onecorporation at the expense of another corpo-Rep. Kevin Knight . . . Three-term legislator eyes office of state treasurer ration, for no meaningful social purpose.\" Knight made news recently by traveling to North Carolina after the failure of proposalsto build a new baseball stadium here for theMinnesota Twins. Team owner Carl Pohlad earlier signed a statement of intent to sell the team to NorthCarolina businessman Don Beaver, who saidhe intended to move the team there after the1998 season. A vote to build a stadium herewould have nullified the Beaver deal. Thefailure of the stadium legislation left an uncer-tain future for professional baseball in Minne-sota. But Knight said there didn't seem to be an enthusiastic sense of welcome for a new base-ball team in North Carolina, and there was notclear support for building a new baseball sta-dium there. Knight concluded the Twins wouldnot be moving there any time soon. \"There is not strong political support in Charlotte\". He added that the Twins are back where they started and that the only thing that will fixthings is new ownership. Knight, who lives in Bloomington with hiswife, Bonnie, and their three children, grew up on Chicago's south side, then the heart ofthe late Richard J. Daley's Democratic ma-chine, run by the longtime mayor of that city. Friends and acquaintances of Knight's fam- ily worked for the Daley administration, andKnight said he learned some important les-sons from observing them. \"[Politics] was a people business.

So how did a youngster who grew in a heavily Democratic area become an outspo-ken Republican? \"As I got older, I wanted to make my own decision on what political affiliation I'd fol-low,\" he said. As he prepares to campaign for state trea- surer, Knight said he'll miss the people in theLegislature. \"But if I'm fortunate enough to win in No- vember, I'll still get to see them,\" he said. \"Iwas fortunate being able to represent peoplein Bloomington.\" Rep. Kevin Knight, a third-term lawmaker known for his fiscal conservatism, is leaving the House to runfor state treasurer.14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998Map courtesy Minnesota History , by Theodore C. Blegen and Theodore L Nydahl A people without a government . . . Border battles precede birth of Minnesota Territory On May 29, 1848, Wisconsin became a state and the settlers who lived in the areabetween the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers became a people without a government. The region had formerly been St. Croix County, the westernmost county of the Wis-consin Territory. And with the Wisconsin stategovernment forming with somewhat smallerboundaries, the territorial government ceasedto exist. Two years earlier in 1846, Morgan L. Martin, a Wisconsin territorial delegate in theU. S. House of Representatives, introduced abill to create the separate territory of\"Minasota\" in the area between the Missis-sippi and St. Croix rivers. Illinois Congress-man Stephen A. Douglas of the HouseCommittee on Territories amended the pro-posed name to the \"Itaska Territory.\" Mem-bers of Congress also suggested the namesJackson, Washington, and Chippewa for theproposed territory. On March 3, 1847, after the name \"Minne- sota\" was selected, the legislation to create anew territory stalled. The measure was tabledafter a senator suggested that the region wasjust too sparsely populated to be a territory,especially if that meant an appropriation for aterritorial government. Later that year, Congress passed enabling legislation that allowed Wisconsin to beginorganizing as a state. The legislation includedprescribed borders that followed Wisconsin'scurrent state boundaries. When the Wisconsin constitutional con- vention met in December 1847, a small mi-nority of the delegates convinced fellowWisconsinites that they should extend thewestern boundary further than was allowed bythe enabling federal legislation. They decidedthe western border ought to run from themouth of the Rum River northeast to therapids of the St. Louis River. Had that beenallowed to remain, much of what is now theMinneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area wouldbe in Wisconsin. Leaders from St. Croix County were op- posed to any change to the borders that Con-gress prescribed. Joseph R. Brown, FranklinSteele, and William R. Marshall, foreseeing afuture Minnesota, lobbied Congress to leavethe borders where they were in the enablinglegislation. Brown and others argued that the new bor- der set by the Wisconsin convention would beunfair to any new territory created in theregion. The border proposed by the Wiscon-sinites had been placed up river from St. An- thony Falls, and no river traffic could proceedpast that point. Under such conditions, theterritory of Minnesota, if it was created,wouldn't have had a single Mississippi Riverlanding suitable for commercial use. Brown and his cohorts were counting on the fact that Congress would side with themon the border issue, effectively leaving St. CroixCounty without a government. Congresswould be forced to designate the region as theMinnesota Territory. Congress reinstated the boundaries that had been in the initial enabling act and grantedWisconsin statehood. However, Congressfailed to act on the issue of St. Croix County,leaving the area an unorganized region. In other situations where reorganization created a \"no-man's-land,\" such as was oncethe case for northeastern Iowa, an adjacentterritory was given jurisdiction over the re-gion. States, however, cannot extend author-ity beyond their state lines. Neither Iowa tothe south nor Wisconsin to the east couldextend legal jurisdiction into the former St.Croix County. Residents of the area were confronted with the lack of a civil authority to bind businesstransactions, civil marriages, and other offi-cial proceedings.Civic leaders met in Stillwater on May 29, 1848, to discuss their plan of action. An inter-esting legal argument emerged from their dis-cussions. Since portions of the WisconsinTerritory were not included in the organiza-tion of the state of Wisconsin, the area left overremained a territory, they believed. The stateof Wisconsin and the territory of Wisconsincould exist side by side, each a distinct politi-cal entity. Henry H. Sibley was elected by the conven- tion and later by a general election \"to proceedto Washington City to best tend to effect theearly organization of the Territory of Minne-sota.\" He was to go to Washington to be seatedin Congress as a territorial delegate from theWisconsin Territory. If for some reason Con-gress didn't buy the territorial argument andrefused to seat Sibley, he was to remain inWashington to lobby for the new territory. On Dec. 4, 1848, Sibley's certificate of elec- tion as a delegate of the territory of Wisconsinwas moved before the U.S. House ofRepresentatives and referred to theCommittee on Elections. Sibley, who had studied law but made his living in the trading business, argued beforethe committee that the residents of the newterritory of Wisconsin were accorded the rightsof the Ordinance of 1787, which created the15 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYNorthwest Territory. These rights could not be arbitrarily withdrawn, he claimed. Sibley won the recommendation that he be seated; however, Congress did not officiallyrecognize a territorial government. In the early part of 1849, political pressure mounted to create territorial governments inCalifornia, Nebraska, and New Mexico, aswell as Minnesota. Democrats, Sibley amongthem, argued for increased expansion into theWest, especially considering the developmentof a transcontinental railroad, which wouldprovide even greater access to these lands.Whigs sought to delay the process so theirnewly elected president, Zachary Taylor, couldappoint the executives of these new territorial governments. Having recently been elected to the Senate, Stephen Douglas was able to get a Minnesota billthrough the Whig-controlled House by linkingit to the creation of the Department of the Inte-rior, a measure the Whig Party greatly desired. On March 3, 1849, the last day of his term, President James Polk signed the law creatingthe territory of Minnesota; however, Presi-dent Taylor would make all the territorialappointments. The territory included thepresent state of Minnesota and the portions ofNorth Dakota and South Dakota east of theMissouri River.Throughout the territorial debate in Wash- ington, population estimates of the regionwere exaggerated by Douglas and Sibley toemphasize the point that the area needed tohave its own territorial government. Douglasclaimed that Minnesota had between 8,000and 10,000 occupants. He argued that Iowaand Oregon had been made territories undersimilar conditions. When the 1850 census wascompleted, records showed that the Minne-sota Territory contained only six thousandresidents, the smallest number of any state ororganized territory at the time. alties for contributing to the delinquency of ajuvenile. Another provision would create acivil penalty for this crime requiring a personfound liable for the delinquency of a juvenileto provide restitution to victims. The bill also would make it easier to get juveniles who are participating in prostitutioninto the state's child protection system. Protecting police officers Several provisions in the bill seek to make it easier and safer for police officers to do theirjob. One such provision comes as a result of an incident where two Richfield police officerswere accused of sexual assault. Although theallegations were proven false, the incidentgreatly disrupted the criminal justice process,not to mention the lives of the two officersinvolved. The provision would make it a criminal violation to harass police officers because ofthe performance of official duties. This provi-sion would also add police officers to a list ofjudicial officials who are protected from retal-iatory harassment under current law. Another provision would authorize officers to conduct pat-down searches on juvenilestaken into custody. Under current law, pat-down searches can be performed only on adult offenders. Propo-nents of the change argued that police officersneed to be protected from juveniles, as well asadults, carrying concealed weapons. In addition, the omnibus bill would make it easier to prosecute people who interfere withofficers making an arrest by expanding thelegal definition of obstruction of justice. Reporting crime Several provisions within the bill require reports to the Legislature regarding crime inMinnesota.One provision would direct the legislative auditor to study the cost of crime in the state,including direct costs to state and local gov-ernments for criminal justice and indirect costsplaced on individuals, businesses, and neigh-borhoods. The bill also would require cities of the first class to provide data on criminal justice byneighborhood, and proposals for an integratedcriminal justice information system whichwould report occurrence and prosecution ofcrime within each city. Another provision seeks more accurate in- formation on prostitution in Minneapolis andSt. Paul. The bill would mandate that cityattorneys in the two cities and county attor-neys in Hennepin and Ramsey counties reporton investigation and prosecution of prostitu-tion within these jurisdictions. Financing justice The bill contains $7.3 million in supple- mental appropriations, a majority of whichwould go to the Department of Corrections,the Department of Public Safety, and the statecourts. Of the total amount, $3.3 million would be recouped in revenue from increased criminaljustice fees and criminal fines. The Department of Corrections would re- ceive $2.8 million, much of which would go toreducing the caseload for probation officers.Grant programs which fund community cor-rections would also be funded through thesedollars. The Department of Public Safety would be appropriated $1.8 million. Of these funds, theoffice of the Crime Victim Ombudsman wouldreceive $125,000 to fund its services; theBureau of Criminal Apprehension would re-ceive $133,000 to add forensic scientists to itscrime lab; and the department would get$300,000 for law enforcement and commu-nity crime prevention grants.The state fire marshal would receive $170,000 of public safety money for the cre-ation of an arson data system. The databasewould contain only basic information at thestate level but would provide links to localcriminal justice agencies for more detailedinformation on specific cases of arson. The bill would appropriate $1.3 million to the state courts for law clerk salaries. The statepublic defender would receive $451,000 fordefense attorney salaries. Another $500,000would be given to Legal Aid to provide legalservice to low-income individuals.

Lambert and Nicole Wood Back in 1941, when the current chief clerk of the House, Edward A. Burdick,began his lengthy career, the only other employee in the chief clerk's front office washis immediate supervisor, Mrs. Agnes Jensen. In a recent interview in her New Hope apartment, Jensen, who turned 100 in July1997, reflected on her many years as the headbookkeeper under seven different chief clerks. \"It's funny about that Legislature,\" Jensen said. \"You just love it.\" Jensen, who has five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, is quick to share her storiesabout the Legislature and her delicately craftedscrapbooks with visitors, particularly the larg-est book, which holds cards and snapshotsfrom her 100th birthday party. \"I have had three main things in my life: working at the state banking department whereI met my husband, the church where I be-longed for 60 years, and the Legislature,\" Jensensaid. Jensen's career in state government began in the early 1920s. When her guardian, formerGov. J.A.O. Preus (See Reflections, page 2), took office in 1921, Jensen joined him at theCapitol as secretary to the commissioner ofbanking. It was here that she met her latehusband, Guy, who was a vice president of theProduce Bank. Next, Jensen joined the temporary staff of the House of Representatives. At first, shecommuted to St. Paul by train and trolleyfrom Mound, she said. When she married andmoved to south Minneapolis, she rode thestreetcar to work. \"Mrs. Jensen's job was very important,\" Burdick said recently. \"There were no otheroffices or departments such as administrativeservices like the House has today.\" An inscription in one of Jensen's scrap- books reads: \"I loved every minute of that job.I started in December to get the office orga-nized and paid all the bills, all the salaries for'I wonder how I did it' . . . Mrs. Agnes Jensen's career spanned seven chief clerks both employees and House members, etc.,etc., etc. Then stayed a month after the sessionto clean up everything.\" She also supervised the stenographers and the typing pool, decades before the arrival ofcomputers and duplicating machines. \"When I look back at those days, I wonder how I did it,\" Jensen said. \"But I was young.\" Jensen recalled the one time she was put in a bind. The chief clerk had instructed her tohold all copies of a new directory. A womanfrom the governor's office called to request 20copies moments later. Jensen is still able tomimic the voice on the other line scolding herwhen she refused the request: \"Mrs. Jensen,this is the governor's office calling.\" \"It's the time I ever cried [at work],\" Jensen said. \"That girl was so horrid to me.\" Jensen's starting wage was $5 per day, she said. When she retired in 1955, she was earn-ing $22.50 per day. \"They were awfully good to me \u2014 theyshould have been because I worked awfully hard,\" she said. Jensen also shared her memories of Burdick as a young man. \"Ed came to my office when he was in his 20s,\" she said. \"But I'm telling you, he was thesmartest kid you ever saw. He loved the Legis-lature.\" In 1943, Hazel Johnson, the first female page in the Minnesota Legislature came towork for Jensen. Johnson retired in 1989, after serving many years as Burdick's desk clerk. \"Ed and Hazel still come to see me,\" Jensen said. \"He is an awfully nice boy and he workedhis way up, too!\" The admiration is mutual.\"I learned a lot from her,\" Burdick said. \"She instilled in her employees the impor-tance of working hard and holding down stateexpenses.\" Legislative Addresses Majority senators and staff: (Name) Minnesota Senate (Room number) State Capitol 75 Constitution Ave. St. Paul, MN 55155-1606House members and staff: (Name) Minnesota House of Representatives (Room number) State Office Building 100 Constitution Ave. St. Paul, MN 55155-1298Minority senators and staff: (Name) Minnesota Senate (Room number) State Office Building 100 Constitution Ave. St. Paul, MN 55155-120617 March 6, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Jim Thielman The clover leaf pressed into a pic- ture frame on Rep. Mark Mahon'sdesk was picked by his son at theMahon homestead in Ireland. Nowthat Mahon is retiring after six years in the House, a trip to Ireland is high onhis agenda \u2014 an agenda that's been fairly fullfor nearly 50 years. Mahon spent four years in the Air Force, another 35 years at Case International Har-vester, 17 years as a local union officer, and 17in city government. Add to that six years as astate representative. \"You add all those up and I should be 100 years old,\" Mahon (DFL-Bloomington) said. Well, maybe 75. Of course, some of those experiences were concurrent, but to stuff allthat experience into Mahon's 67 years seem-ingly would require a shoehorn. Mahon plans to stay active in a public role he hasn't yet defined, but he does not denyfeeling a twinge of melancholy about leavingstate government. \"I think anybody we send out of here who says they don't miss it is not being true tothemselves. This has been a real rewardingexperience. I made a lot of good friends,\"Mahon said. \"I know what people have oftenthought of politicians, but along with my daysat Case, I can't say that I ever worked with agroup of more dedicated people.\" His margin of victory has increased in each of his three elections, and some urged him tochase a fourth term, but Mahon said, \"Sooneror later you have to let go, and it just seemedlike it was the right time.\" Mahon considered waiting until the end of the session to announce his retirement, butdecided that was unfair to voters and candi-dates. At least three Republicans have an-nounced candidacy for his District 40A seat,and word is as many Democrats will be part ofthe mix. Another consideration for Mahon is his wife, Florence, who is recovering from surgeryto remove a benign brain tumor. She coordi-nated all his political campaigns. While therecovery seems smooth, the incident suggestsit might be time to focus more on his family,Mahon said. Mahon serves on the House Local Govern- ment and Metropolitan Affairs, Financial In-stitutions and Insurance, and Transportationand Transit committees. He's vice chair of theTransportation and Transit Finance Division. It was during a transportation finance meet-Rep. Mark Mahon . . . Trip to Ireland tops legislator's retirement agenda ing this session that Mahon introduced a billpertaining to a new category of collector li-cense plates for cars from the mid-70s that leftthe hearing room resonating with laughter.Legislators were inclined to think the plateswould end up on cars more rusty than collect-ible, and the bill failed to get a hearing theprevious session. \"I never thought it would get a hearing this year, either\" Mahon said later. The grilling of Mahon, and his responses, took a comic turn. At least three legislatorswere in tears before discussion concluded,setting up the payoff line from Rep. BernieLieder (DFL-Crookston), who chairs the divi-sion and who co-sponsored the \"Representative Mahon, is this your re-elec- tion bill?\" Lieder asked. When the final round of laughter ebbed, Mahon admitted it was perhaps the first pieceof legislation ever laughed to death. Rep. AlJuhnke (DFL-Willmar) was among the cul-prits. \"Mark came to the Legislature with a lot of experience,\" Juhnke said. \"I think he realizedpolitics is a funny game, and if you take your-self too seriously, you'll drive yourself nuts.He was a good sport about carrying that bill,and I've never seen a committee recess to drytheir eyes. That was a lot of fun, and I thinkthat's how we'll all remember him.\" While self-deprecating, Mahon has theknack for trimming to the essence of compli- cated transportation issues. He's dealt so longwith civic issues that his demeanor suggeststhe competent, workmanlike approach of thelocal, small-town barber pulling up the win-dow shade and lighting the barber pole foranother day's work. He's balanced that with a knack for long- range planning. Mahon has championed light rail transit in the metropolitan area for years. He said incommittee hearings this year that 20 years agowas the best time to do it. \"This is the second-best time,\" Mahon said. \"If we don't do it with the budget surplus wehave now, it will be another 20 years. Frankly,I think if you get a segment of light rail in andoperating somewhere, everyone else will belining up and asking 'when is it going to be ourturn?'\" Mahon is also proud of his work during his first term to pass a bill that helped Bloomingtonget bonding for highway improvementsaround the Mall of America. The project hascontributed to the mall's raging success. Because Mahon thinks everyone should be involved in public service, he says he has noplans to \"go and hide. I'm 67. Not young; notthat old. But I've spent 23 years in electiveoffice, and it's hard to remember when I wasn'trunning for something.\" After a long career of public service, Rep. Mark Mahon is leaving the House after this term, but theBloomington resident plans to stay active in public affairs.18 SESSION WEEKLY / March 6, 1998 A partial listing . . .

LouWangberg to write a 10-page report on the signifi- cance of his office as he prepared to moveinto the Capitol in 1978. Wangberg and Gov. Al Quie barely knew each other as they began their term inoffice. But Wangberg, the former Bemidjischool superintendent, had done his home-work. Then 37 years old, Wangberg assessed his new office in a report to Quie entitled\"Reflections on the Lieutenant Governor-ship.\" It was perhaps an ideal time to do sobecause there was a new path to ponder. Quie and Wangberg made up the third pairing under Minnesota's new governor-lieutenant governor model. A constitu-tional amendment in 1972 permitted theSenate to choose its own presiding officer.That made the lieutenant governor a full-time official of the executive branch. So Wangberg reviewed the functions of the office, compared the duties of theofficerholder before and after the change,and described an expansion of duties forthe lieutenant governor. \"There seems to have been an attempt to 'manufacture' assignments for the office inorder to justify expansion to full time,\"Wangberg wrote. In preparing the report, Wangberg con-Wangberg report reflects on lieutenant governorship tacted some of the boards of which thelieutenant governor was supposed to be amember under the official duties of theoffice. He discovered officials for some ofthe boards could not even name the previ-ous two lieutenant governors. With diplomacy, Wangberg deemed many of the listed activities \"important,\"but added that some \"lack the substancethat helps the governor make stronger de-cisions, nor do they offer deep or broadtraining to prepare the lieutenant governorfor a future role of substance.\" The goal Wangberg illuminated in his \"reflections\" was to meld \"symbolism andsubstance.\" wanted to couple \"ceremo-nial responsibilities\" with \"something Wangberg said recently that he does notrecall his 20-year-old report, or what prompted him to write it. Perhaps it wasbecause he and Quie were nearly strangers.Quie had not chosen a running mate. Heleft the decision open to the convention. \"We had met maybe twice,\" Wangberg said from his Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., home,\"but Al was always searching for the bestanswer, and I thought we had a great work-ing relationship. I even served as his chief ofstaff for a time.\" Despite Wangberg's hope to perhaps re- define the office, he couldn't overcome theuniversal stigma attached to being No. 2. A 1979 newspaper article claimed Wangberg was given more responsibilityby Quie than any lieutenant governor un-der the new model. But by 1980, Wangbergwas considered by some newspaper colum-nists to have \"drifted into obscurity.\" Even Wangberg voiced frustration with the office. He called it \"the strangest government office ever invented.\" Quie, made vulnerable by a fiscal crisis, did not run again. Wangberg took up thetask, but he was soundly defeated byWheelock Whitney in a GOP primary. Wangberg moved into the private sector to work for Jostens, and later became ownerof a group of for-profit colleges in Florida.He currently chairs the colleges, which of-fer two-year associate degrees in respira-tory therapy.

By law, amendments may be introduced, whichopens the possibility of the introduction of additions or deletions to policy changes.Thus, the number of bills and the number of attempted changes make for longerworking hours in the chamber, from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m. (24 hours) as a full session day. Session debate may get quite \"testy\" or vocal as advocates and critics discuss issues they strongly believe in or strongly oppose. History teaches us that such battles of will are not a 20th century invention. In Roman times, the statesman Cicero utilized the spoken word as an ideal for universal discourse;he expertly used his oratorical qualities to address the testiness of his peers as he calledfor unity. Sometimes, House debate seems to break down to a battle of \"Them\" vs. \"Us.\" Although the members/debaters may be friends, their banter has, on occasion, dis-solved into disagreements viewed as a discourse on what is good or bad for humanity. Interestingly, lessons or parables that newly elected legislators hear from leadership consultant Dr. Robert Terry during a new members' orientation are lessons aboutunity, authenticity, ethics, and responsibility as related to political discourse. As a reminder, it is worth sharing some excerpts from Terry's lecture. In \"The Story of Strangers,\" Terry teaches a parable about Us and Them. When large numbers of Them moved next to Us, \". . . a few of Us convened a council. What to do was paramount on the agenda. . . . [A]fter serious, intensive and often fear-filled debate . . . a few of Us, selected for our insight and strength, would attempt to meetThem. Warnings accompanied the investigative party: 'Be careful.' 'Be always onguard.' 'Return immediately if in danger.'\" After some time had passed, and Us and Them maintained their separateness, \"a new strategy to deal with Them emerged from a community dialogue. 'Why don't we,' saidone of Us, 'make agreements to recognize each others' existence.'\" \"Finally, after much debate, the only common ground and the basis for the initial agreement was that the community of Us and Them were equal in their claim tosupremacy. Once it became necessary to share power, \"a new word entered into thevocabulary of discourse. Us and Them was replaced by We . . . [and] self-righteousnessfound no home in this dialogue.\" As session begins to wind down and stress may build up to testiness, it is well to be mindful that laws are for the good of all people. Thus, what Terry calls a \"deepest levelof responsibility\" may lie in striving to be aware that Us and Them are We. \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY The omnibus tax bill approved by the House calls for a \"no-wait rebate\" to go to homeowners and renters before Oct. 15, 1998. Photo illustration by Tom OlmscheidBy Matt Wetzel It took about 11 hours of painstaking de- bate, but the House passed its 1998 omnibustax bill in the early morning hours of March12. The bill includes some $740 million inproperty tax rebates and reforms and othertax cuts. The bill now goes to the Senate, which has already passed a tax bill that includes only$400 million in rate reductions and no re-bates. Differences likely will be worked out ina conference committee. The House bill ( HF3840 ) passed on a 93-40 vote. Republicans introduced numerousamendments calling for deeper, more perma-nent cuts in income and property taxes, butthose amendments were rejected. The omnibus bill emerged from the House Taxes Committee March 6 and was approvedby the House Ways and Means CommitteeMarch 9.Omnibus tax bill . . . House bill features property tax rebates and reforms The struggle to decide how much money to return to taxpayers and when to do it is aproduct of economic forecasts that show a$1.9 billion surplus in the state's budget. House Republicans have said Minnesotans have been overtaxed and that six consecutivebudget surpluses prove it. The minority cau-cus leadership has sought permanent tax cutsand reform in property and income taxes. DFLers, who are in the majority, and the governor, have agreed to more modest re-forms and one-time rebates. They urge cau- tion on the idea of permanent tax cuts, sayingthat if the booming economy goes sour, theprojected surplus could become a shortfall. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) submitted a minority report ofthe tax bill on the floor Tuesday, one thatcalled for reducing income tax rates by half apercentage point and the elimination of the\"marriage penalty,\" which requires marriedcouples filing jointly to pay more tax thanunmarried couples filing single returns. Thatminority report was tabled by the House on a65-63 vote. \"You've got a five-second sound bite, but it's not responsible government,\" said Rep.Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey). The omnibus bill is sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), chair of the TaxesCommittee. In accordance with 1997 legislation, the bill would put $873 million in the state's property tax reform account and would return $1.2billion to taxpayers in the form of rebates thisyear and next. \"This bill is in balance,\" Long said.Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) sub- mitted several amendments on the floor dur-ing debate on the tax bill. All were rejected,including one that would have cut incometaxes. \"Six years ago we started having surplusesand they've been greater and greater and greater,\" Van Dellen said. \"State governmentneeds to go on a diet. Minnesotans can makebetter use of their money than government.\" Long defended the effort to provide prop- erty tax rebates while being cautious aboutpermanent tax cuts. \"This is one area where I think the governor is right on,\" Long said. \"The governor learnedfrom the experiences of the Legislature in theearly 1980s.\" After a variety of tax cuts were enacted in the late 1970s, the state was hit with a budgetcrisis in the early 1980s, and the Legislaturewas forced to pass surtaxes and a series of newtaxes. Here are some highlights of the bill: Property tax rebates The bill would provide a rebate for homeowners and renters equal to 20 percentof the property taxes they pay in 1998, whichis similar to the rebate in effect for propertytaxes paid in 1997. Under the bill, the maximum rebate would be $1,500. It would be allowed as a refundableincome tax credit claimed on the 1998 taxreturn, filed in 1999. The bill also calls for a so-called \"no-wait rebate.\" The proposal would provide an extra1997 property tax rebate, which would be 50percent of the regular 1997 rebate. The maxi-mum would be $750. That payment would goout as soon as possible after July 1, but no laterthan Oct. 15, 1998. Property tax reform Several provisions in the bill aim to reduce the property tax burden on homeowners, busi-nesses, and others. Under the House proposal, the general edu- cation homestead credit \u2014 which providessavings to homeowners \u2014 would increasefrom 32 percent to 52 percent \u2014 to a maxi-mum $290 \u2014 of property taxes paid, begin-ning with taxes payable in 1999. The bill also would decrease the property classification rate on homes valued at up to$75,000 from 1 percent to .875 percent, andthe classification rate of houses valued higherwould go from 1.85 percent to 1.619 percent. A total of $55 million would go to the De- partment of Children, Families and Learningbeginning in the year 2000, and every year4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 13, 1998By Grant Martin Ray O. Pleasant compares his experi- ences in the Minnesota House of Represen-tatives to an advanced education. \"It's like getting a master's degree,\" Pleas- ant said. \"When you're an elected officialyou're force-fed information and you learnvery quickly. You have to \u2014 you're goingto vote on it later that day.\" Pleasant was the second African-Ameri- can to be elected to the House. The first, J.Francis Wheaton, was elected in 1898. Pleas-ant was elected in 1972. Both served dis-tricts in the Bloomington area, and bothserved as Republicans. Pleasant, who worked as an engineer for 31 years, first got involved in local politicswhen he was appointed to a Bloomingtoncity advisory council working with envi-ronmental issues. \"The city was developing rapidly at that time and there were certain areas we wantedto maintain in their natural state,\" he said. Pleasant was elected to the Bloomington City Council in1969. He was successful insecuring federal grants to pre-serve park areas in the city. After serving three years on the city council, Pleasant de-cided to run for the Houseseat. He was successful in hisfirst bid for the House andserved eight years until 1980.He chaired the House Localand Urban Affairs Commit-tee in 1979. \"It was a good experience, but I wouldn't want to gothrough it again,\" he said. \"It was sort oflike the Army in that way.\" Pleasant readily admits that his thoughts on the Legislature are influenced by the lastsession he served. After the 1978 elections,the party division in the House was a tie,67-67. The two parties were forced to nego-tiate a bipartisan leadership, with aRepublican speaker and a DFL majorityleader. Pleasant says that it was an unproductive and contentious period for the House. \"You had to raise your hand three times just to get a pencil,\" he said. Pleasant says that after that experience he decided leave politics up to his wife,Gene, who is currently serving on thePleasant likens House service to Army;continues active community life governor's judicial selection board. Theboard is responsible for interviewing po-tential judges for appointment. Since his time in the Legislature, Pleasant has continued his active community in-volvement. Most recently, he has been do-nating his talents to a NormandaleCommunity College advisory board. Sixyears ago, he helped start an annual golftournament that raises $17,000 each yearfor student scholarships. Pleasant, who has worked for the Richfield Bank and Trust Company sincehe left the Legislature, says that he plans toretire at the end of this year. But retirementdoes not mean inactivity. \"I stay active. I'm not one to just stay home and watch TV,\" he said. Pleasant said he will continue to do the things he loves: fishing, traveling, golf, andmost important, community involvement. Pleasant has recently been appointed to serve on a voluntary advisory board for a residential group home in Eden Prairie. The home, operated by a Baptist churchorganization, provides services to boys ages12 to 18 who are experiencing emotional orbehavioral problems. \"We've had quite a success,\" Pleasant said. \"One of our students is now the man-ager of a KFC [restaurant].\" The group home seeks to provide a safe and supportive environment for the boysso they can eventually return to theirfamilies. Pleasant says that he is very excited about the opportunity to serve the organization. \"That's my new agenda,\" Pleasant said. \"That's my next thing to be educated on.\" Former Rep. Ray O. Pleasant was the second African-Americanelected to the House. He served from 1973 to 1980.after, to decrease the education property taxlevy. Farmers also would get a break. Class rates on their land valued up to $115,000 woulddecrease from .4 percent to 0.33 percent. Therest of the property that doesn't exceed 320acres would go from .9 percent to 0.78 per-cent. There also would be decreases in commer- cial and industrial property class rates. Thelower tier of market value (the first $150,000)would go from 2.7 percent to 2.36 percent,and the remainder would go from 4 percent to3.5 percent. Owners of apartment buildings with four or more units would see their class rate go from2.9 percent to 2.5 percent. Those with build-ings with two or three units would see theirclass rate go from 2.1 percent to 1.7 percent,and owners of buildings with just one rentalunit would see that class rate go from 1.9percent to 1.25 percent on the first $75,000 ofmarket value, and from 2.1 percent to 1.7percent on the rest. The bill also includes a provision that would exempt \"distressed homesteads,\" in whichdilapidated homes in marginal neighborhoodsare being rehabilitated by the owner. Thosehomeowners would get a maximum five-yearexemption from property taxes if their homesneed at least $20,000 in repairs. The measurewould include only owner-occupied, single-family homes in Minneapolis, St. Paul, andDuluth. An amendment offered by Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) would exempt all prop-erty owners from having their property valuefor tax purposes increase by more than therate of inflation, as determined by the Con-sumer Price Index, or 5 percent, whichever isless. The limit would not include improvements in the property. The provision would endin 2002. Savings, seniors, and studies Under the bill, senior citizens with an an- nual income of $40,000 would qualify for thesenior property tax deferral program, increas-ing the maximum from $30,000. Also, the bill calls for the state's budget reserve to increase from $522 million to $582million. Finally, the bill calls for creation of a tax study commission. The commission \u2014 madeup of state, county, and local officials andmembers of the public \u2014 would study thefinancial relationships between state and localgovernments in Minnesota. 5 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 5 - 12, 1998 BONDING Bonding bill passes House The much-anticipated bonding bill \u2014 com- plete with $65 million in funds for the St. PaulRiverCentre hockey arena \u2014 was approved bythe House March 12. The vote was 96-37. The bill ( HF3843 ), sponsored by Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters), was approved by theHouse Capital Investment Committee March10 and by the House Ways and Means Com-mittee March 12. This year's House bonding bill focuses on transportation, higher education, environ-ment, and economic development projectsstatewide. If passed in its current form, the $945 mil- lion proposal would be the largest bondingappropriation in state history. The bondingbill passed in 1994 holds the current record at$711 million. The St. Paul RiverCentre project has be- come the most talked-about provision of theHouse bonding bill, mainly because theSenate's version of the bonding bill would notfund the widely publicized project. The House bill would provide $65 million to the city of St. Paul to build the hockey arenato be incorporated into the civic center com-plex in downtown. Included in the governor's capital recom- mendations to the Legislature, the facilitywould be used mainly by the Minnesota Wild,the new NHL franchise granted to the city. The RiverCentre may not even be the big- gest point of contention between the two bond-ing plans. The Senate bonding bill, passed bythe full Senate March 5, would pay for most ofthe projects with cash from the general fund.The House version would issue general obli-gation bonds for most of these projects, bor-rowing money to finance the improvements. The differences between the House and Sen- ate proposals will have to be reconciled inconference committee. Here are some other highlights of the House capital improvement bill. Light rail transit The prospect of a light rail transit (LRT) system in the Twin Cities moves closer toreality with the House proposal. The bondingbill would provide $56 million toward transitway development.The bill would provide $49 million of this amount to build a transportation line fromdowntown Minneapolis to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the Mall ofAmerica. The line is being called the HiawathaAvenue Corridor. The state's contribution would be matched with federal transit capital funds that shouldbe made available by Congress. The remaining $7 million for LRT in the bonding proposal would be used to studyexpansion of the LRT into St. Paul and othercorridors and to study commuter raildevelopment. LRT typically serves urban-suburban mar- kets with short distances between stations.Commuter rail primarily serves the suburbanmarket, typically providing links from outly-ing areas to the LRT. Commuter rail usesexisting rail lines and is characterized bylonger station-to-station distances ofapproximately 2.5 miles. The bill calls for $24 million to be available in fiscal year 1999 for the Hiawatha Corridorproject and $25 million for the project in eachof the subsequent three fiscal years. Higher education spending The largest portion of the bonding bill \u2014 $238.5 million \u2014 would go to improvementsto the state's higher education facilities. Ofthat amount, the University of Minnesotawould receive $115 million for projects acrossthe state. The Twin Cities campus would receive fund- ing for several improvements, including $35million for the Walter Library, $2.5 millionfor renovations to Amundson Hall, MurphyHall, and Ford Hall, and $6.4 million for im-provements to Peters Hall. Other projects in the university system in- clude $22.3 million for improvements to thescience and mathematics facility at the Morriscampus, $21.2 million for the construction ofa new library at the Duluth campus, and $4.4million for university-operated agriculturestations statewide. The Minnesota State Colleges and Univer- sities system would receive $124 million forstatewide mil-lion at the North Hennepin CommunityCollege, $9 million at St. Paul TechnicalCollege, and $14 million at Hibbing Commu-nity and Technical College.K-12 education projects The Department of Children, Families and Learning would receive $49 million forprojects, under the bill. Of that amount, $10 million would go to Youth Enrichment Grants. Communitiescould apply for the funds to develop after-school community facilities. The department would also receive $3.5 million for the development of state residen-tial academies. The governor had requested$12 million for the creation of three acad-emies for at-risk students; the House bill pro-vides a grant to a state agency or politicalsubdivision for the development of onefacility. The bill would also provide $8.5 million for the renovation of facilities at the state acad-emies for the deaf and blind in Faribault. Recreation and conservation The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would receive nearly $110 million fora myriad of projects, including $12 million toacquire and maintain state trails and $3 mil-lion for improvements to the state parksystem. Other projects overseen by the DNR would include $15 million for grants to local govern-ments to prevent or control flood damage, $9million to improve trails in the metropolitanarea park system and to connect them withexisting state and regional trails, $8 million toestablish and maintain metropolitan-areagreen space and natural areas, and $1.8 mil-lion for safe harbors on Lake Superior. The Board of Soil and Water Resources would receive $12.8 million. Of that figure,$10 million would target wetlands for protec-tion under the Reinvest in Minnesota pro-gram. Under the program, landowners arepaid to retire certain lands from agriculturalproduction or place wetlands intoconservation. Convention centers Consistent with the governor's proposal, convention centers also receive a good deal ofattention in the House bill. Along with the St.Paul RiverCentre, the city of Minneapoliswould receive $87 million to help finance thecompletion of the Minneapolis ConventionCenter. Duluth would receive $10 million for the expansion of the Duluth Entertainment and6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 13, 1998Convention Center. Other convention center funding would be provided to the cities ofFergus Falls, Hutchinson, and St. Cloud. BUSINESS Omnibus liquor bill Drinking among college students is a high- profile issue, so it wasn't surprising whenHouse floor debate on the omnibus liquor billMarch 11 centered on a provision that wouldgrant temporary liquor licenses for events onstate university campuses. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), passed on a 115-13 vote. The bill would allow the issuance of tempo- rary on-sale liquor licenses to state universi-ties, but not for fraternity or sorority parties orother functions aimed at students. Legislatorsalso were told the bill would not pertain tosporting events. The temporary licenses would allow on- sales for up to four consecutive days in con-junction with a social event. Approval of atemporary license would also have to comefrom the university president. Tunheim said during floor debate the sales were not to be directed at students, but werefor social functions such as plays held oncampus, for example, where wine sales wererequested. Tunheim also said that because the cam- puses belong to communities sometimes com-munity functions are held on these sites. Someof the organizations sponsoring such eventshave requested the ability to sell liquor. \"But this still doesn't prohibit use by stu- dents,\" said Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-VadnaisHeights). She expressed concerns that there istoo much drinking on campuses and that thebill would send a signal to younger people thatalcohol is a vital part of social functions. The bill also would allow temporary licenses to be issued for liquor sales within 1,500 feet ofstate universities. A current law generally pro-hibits such sales. Another provision of the bill would allow cities to issue up to 12 one-day temporaryintoxicating liquor licenses during a 12-monthperiod. The current limit is set at three four-day licenses, four three-day licenses, or twosix-day permits. The bill ( HF2695/SF2274* ) now goes to the governor. Need a copy of a bill? Call the Chief Clerks Office at (612) 296-2314Business on Sundays A new law will make it easier forMinnesota's boat, snowmobile,and all-terrain vehicle dealers todo business on Sundays. Previously, boat, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle trailers were considered \"motor vehicles\" under state law,which prohibits the sale of motor vehicles onSundays. That meant customers without theirown trailer had no way to transport theirpurchases on Sundays. Effective March 6, the new law fixed the impractical glitch in state law by exemptingcertain trailers from the Sunday sales ban. A second provision in the new law also aims to make life easier for trailer dealers. Prior to the passage of the law, it was neces- sary for an individual to hold a franchise li-cense in order to sell a motor vehicle. The newlaw exempts trailers from the franchiserequirement. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), spon- sor of the measure, was alerted to the prob-lems with trailer sales by a small marine dealerin his district. Originally, Anderson said, heconsidered doing away with the Sunday mo-tor vehicle sales ban entirely. But that idea opened a \"hornet's nest,\" he said. Some dealers support Sunday sales; manydo not. During a Feb. 17 committee hearing, Scott Lambert of the Minnesota Auto Dealers Asso-ciation, said that his organization has no prob-lem with exempting trailers from the Sundaysales ban, but the automobile dealers Lambertrepresents are not interested in doing regularbusiness on Sundays. Sen. Bob Lessard (DFL-Int'l Falls) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF2425/SF2170*/CH267Signed by the governor EDUCATIONSCHOOLCONSUMERS Getting extended area service A telephone call to a child's school can mean a long distance charge for some ruralMinnesota parents. A 1997 law eased the process for phone customers within a school district to petitionfor extended area service, which would ensurecalls made within school district boundarieswould be local calls. The House passed a bill March 9 that would alter that law to make it even easier to petitionthe Public Utilities Commission (PUC) forextended area service. The vote was 121-8. Under the 1997 law, a majority of all tele- phone company customers in each exchangemust vote in favor of extended area service, which could mean an increase in monthlytelephone charges. Under HF3644 , only a majority of custom- ers who cast a vote would be needed to extendthe service. The legislation would make the voting cri- teria for extended area service within a schooldistrict the same as when a community wantsto extend its phone service, such as the pos-sible move by Northfield to petition to be-come part of the metropolitan area forlocal-call service. The original language of this year's bill, sponsored by House Minority Leader SteveSviggum (R-Kenyon), would have made thechange in voting criteria retroactive to April27, 1997, the original effective date of the 1997law. This could have had an effect on electionsheld since that date. But an amendment offered on the House floor by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey)changed the proposed effective date to the dayfollowing enactment. Some legislators argued that extended area service can lead to doubling or tripling of aprivate phone bill. A spokesperson for the PUC said a signifi- cant monthly increase per line can happenwhen a comparatively tiny exchange, such asNorthfield, petitions to join an exchange withan enormous customer base, such as the TwinCities metropolitan area. But circumstances would be different when a petition seeks only to waive long-distancecharges within a school district. The PUC spokesperson said the commis- sion has not yet seen any of the proposed rateincreases that resulted since enactment of the1997 law. But the spokesperson said the costper residential line would be mitigated be-cause the additional expense is distributedevenly among the new exchanges and schooldistrict extended area service does not have tomeet a minimum call traffic requirement. According to the PUC, the anticipated resi- dential increase for extended area servicewithin school districts would probably be onlya few dollars monthly per residential line. The bill now heads to the Senate. Omnibus K-12 education bill Schools would receive an extra $61 per stu- dent for new computers and they would alsobe allowed to take up to three years to phase inthe state's new graduation standards, underthe omnibus K-12 education bill approved bythe House March 6.7 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY HF2874 passed on a vote of 102-26 after hours of debate over whether to delay imple-menting the new \"Profiles in Learning\" por-tion of the state's graduation standards or tostick to the current schedule, which calls forhaving the new program in place next fall. The standards aim to incorporate more workaday skills and projects into traditionalacademic areas. Some critics say they wouldundermine rigorous scholarship and someteachers say they haven't had enough time toprepare for the change. But Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), chair of the K-12 Education Finance Division of theHouse Education Committee and the omni-bus bill's sponsor, said she doesn't want to seethe state back away from its commitment totough new standards. \"If we don't stick with these standards we might as well never use the words 'educationreform' in this state,\" she said. The compromise approved by the House would allow districts to stick to the currentschedule or choose a gradual, three-year imple-mentation plan. Districts would have to re-port to the state by July 1, 1998, regardingtheir choice. More technology funding The omnibus bill also includes $59 million targeted for putting a computer in every class-room in the state. That funding was added tothe bill March 2, after Gov. Arne Carlsonannounced an increase in the state's forecastbudget surplus. Districts could use the $61 per student to buy computer hardware, software, or relatedequipment. Schools that already have full com-puter access could use the money for text-books. Kelso said the state was recognizing that technology is going to continue to play anincreasing role in education, and it's going torequire an increasing amount of money. \"It's going to be an incredibly cruel, hard world for kids who graduate without com-puter skills,\" she said. \"In this year of surplus,if we can ensure that there's a computer inevery classroom, that's a big step.\" The one-time technology funding would be in addition to $63 per student targeted in thebill for graduation-standard implementation. The bulk of that money would go directly to schools for staff training, with the rest ear-marked for districts to reduce class-size andimprove gifted and talented programs. Special education The bill also contains provisions designed to limit what some lawmakers say are spiralingincreases in the state's special education costs.Frosty gaze Chris Lechner, a sixth-grader at DiscoverySchool in St. Cloud, peers through a frostedschool bus window to get a glimpse of theCapitol as his class arrives for a tour March 11.Under the bill, the state would pay a per- centage of the legal costs incurred by districtswho win in court against parents suing forincreased special education services for theirchildren. That plan also includes incentivesfor working out problems through mediationinstead of litigation. A controversial provision that would pro- hibit state special education requirements fromexceeding federal standards also remains inthe House-approved bill. Other key provisions Other provisions included in HF2874 in- clude: exempting school districts from the current law which caps school superintendent sala-ries at 95 percent of the governor's salary; allowing school districts to establish criteria and compel students in danger of failing toattend summer school; adding $500,000 to expand existing all-day kindergarten programs to certain schools; giving schools $4 per day for each suspended student placed in an in-school or alternativesuspension program instead of being senthome; and allowing public groups to receive grants to help build state-run boarding schools for at-risk teens. About $12 million to build threesuch schools is currently being consideredfor inclusion in the House omnibus bond-ing bill. The education omnibus bill now moves to conference committee. The Senate-ap-proved version would provide $18 million lessin overall education funding and would notallow for the three-year phase-in of gradua-tion standards. The Senate bill also does notcall for removing the superintendent salarycap, but does call for eliminating the StateBoard of Education. ENVIRONMENT Environmental spending Several controversial issues \u2014 a morato- rium on feedlots, personal watercraft restric-tions, a ban on snowmobile studs, andlakeshore lease lot sales \u2014 remain alive in theHouse omnibus environment, natural re-sources, and agriculture spending bill. The $9.4 million bill ( HF3799/SF3353* ), sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St.Paul), passed the House after a lengthy debateMarch 5. The vote was 68-62. \"For some reason, the opposition would like to consider this bill anti-agriculture andanti-tourism,\" Osthoff said. \"The fact of thematter is, [this bill] could be categorized aspro-Minnesota.\" The bill now heads to conference commit- tee, where the House and Senate will attemptto reconcile the differences in their environ-ment, natural resources, and agriculturespending proposals. Here's a look at some of the key provisions of the House bill. Living with livestock An amended version of Rep. Doug Peterson's (DFL-Madison) so-called \"livingwith livestock\" bill ( HF3441 ) was rolled into the omnibus bill. Most notably, the bill would impose a mora- torium on new construction or expansion offeedlots at the level of 750 animal units. (Ananimal unit is a measurement of waste pro-duced by certain species. One animal unit isequal to one steer or heifer, 2.5 hogs over 55pounds, or 100 chickens.) The moratoriumwould expire June 30, 2001. Many representatives vehemently opposed the moratorium provision. \"It only stops rural economic development and growth for three years,\" Minority LeaderSteve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said.8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 13, 1998The bill also would prohibit the issuance of permits to construct or expand clay, earthen,or flexible membrane (plastic-lined) waste la-goons. Dairy operations under 750 units wouldbe exempt from this provision. After March 1, 2000, those who commer- cially manage and apply animal wastes wouldhave to hold valid animal waste technicianlicenses issued by the Department of Agricul-ture. Most family farmers would be exemptfrom the provision. The bill would clarify the power of counties to adopt feedlot ordinances that are morestringent than those of the MinnesotaPollution Control Agency. The agency would be authorized to deny permits to feedlot operators who have badenvironmental records in other states. Personal watercraft Portions of the proposed \"personal water- craft courtesy and safety act\" backed by Rep.Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby) also have beenfolded into the environment finance bill. The personal watercraft language in the omnibus bill would require that personalwatercraft operators pass a mandatory safetycourse and pay a $10 fee for a certificate. Also, a $30 fee for a three-year personal watercraft license would be established. Thefees would be earmarked for the Departmentof Natural Resources (DNR) for personalwatercraft law enforcement costs. A nuisance clause in the bill would prohibit the operation of a personal watercraft in onespecific area for more than 30 consecutiveminutes. Hasskamp said she was encouraged to in- clude the nuisance provision after receivingnumerous complaints from \"people who saythey have been emotionally pushed over theedge at times by individuals wanting to showoff and ride around in the same spot for hours.\" The bill also would mandate a DNR study on the impact of personal watercraft on loonsand loon nesting areas. Hasskamp is sponsoring a separate bill (HF1351 ) that calls for a personal watercraft ban on lakes of 200 acres. That bill awaits avote on the House floor. Snowmobile studs Under another provision of the omnibus bill, no snowmobile with a track equippedwith metal studs could be operated on publiclands, roads, or trails after July 1, 2000. Although many claim that studs make for safer riding, proponents of the measure saypaved snowmobile trails are being destroyedby studs.\"Of the 212 miles of state paved trails, 103 [miles] have been damaged,\" Osthoff said. Originally, the proposed ban would have taken effect immediately, but Rep. Tom Bakk(DFL-Cook) offered a successful amendmentthat would give the snowmobile industry twoyears to develop a product to replace metalstuds. Approximately 80,000 snowmobilers in Minnesota have invested $400 to $500 for thestuds, Bakk said. \"Snowmobiling is very important to the winter tourism economy in Minnesota,\" hesaid. \"They're going to take their snowmo-biles to Wisconsin and Michigan because theyfeel that strongly about the safety factor.\" Bakk's amendment received bipartisan support. \"How is a snowmobiler from Wisconsin who happens to have studs on his or hermachine and who has no intention of ridingon our paved trails supposed to come here andspend money in our hotels and restaurants?\"asked Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus). \"The an-swer is they won't.\" Lakeshore lease lots A provision of the omnibus bill that would authorize the DNR to sell 546 lakeshore leaselots that are part of the Permanent SchoolTrust Fund was unsuccessfully challenged byRep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth). The trust fund consists of approximately 2.5 million acres of land owned by the stateand managed by the DNR. The money that theDNR receives from five-year leases on the landis earmarked for educational spending. Over the next 20 years, Munger said, the state would earn an additional $3 million fromleasing the land rather than selling it. \"Why should we sell the land and allow private owners to reap these profits?\" he said. Some people who lease the trust fund prop- erties have complained of erratic appraisalsand sharp increases in the amount they arecharged for the use of the land, Bakk said. \"Even if all the land was sold, we're talking 426 acres,\" he said. \"These are tiny pieces ofland that people have been on for decades.\" Whitewater rafting on the Mississippi One provision included in the bill would explore the possibility of harnessing the waterpower of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis forrecreational pursuits. The DNR would receive $100,000 to con- duct engineering and hydraulic research intothe possible development of a whitewater parkfor kayaking, rafting, and canoeing at the falls.Deformed frogs The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency would receive $375,000 for research into thecause of deformities found in frogs across thestate. Currently researchers are speculating that groundwater contamination or possible ul-traviolet radiation may be the cause of thedeformities. The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency also has begun to examine theissue. Minnesota Zoo shortfall The Minnesota Zoological Gardens would receive $500,000 for operating costs to makeup for a serious shortfall in gate receipts lastsummer. The Apple Valley zoo was forced to ask the Legislature for help after a string of bad luck,bad weather, and bad press, Kathryn Roberts,the zoo's director, said during a Jan. 28hearing. The bill would require the zoo to address its attendance forecasting methods to avoid aproblem in the future. Less transport packaging waste A bill that aims to reduce the amount of transport packaging waste created by the softdrink industry is headed for the governor'sdesk. HF2696/SF2402* , sponsored by Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), passed theHouse March 9 on a 105-23 vote. The soft drink industry in Minnesota is considering a $15 million investment in reus-able, recyclable plastic merchandise pallets.During a Feb. 17 committee hearing, DaveLocey, of the Minnesota Soft Drink Associa-tion, said the plastic pallets would cost about$32 each, compared to $5 to $7 each for thewood pallets the industry currently uses. Currently, there is a system in place, Locey explained, where third parties collect usedpallets from retail sites and then resell them tosoft drink companies. Under the bill, third party collectors would be prohibited from taking plastic pallets thatare labeled as private property. The palletswould belong to the soft drink companies, andthe companies' investment in the plastic pal-lets would be protected. Some House members questioned the need for special legislation to protect plastic palletowners and wondered where the responsibil-ity would lie if pallets were accidentally lost inthe course of doing business. \"If Pepsi wants to use plastic pallets, it's a good idea, but I don't think a grocer should get9 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYin trouble if one of them is missing.\" Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) said. \"This is agood concept, but I don't believe it should bea law.\" In 1995, 22 percent of municipal solid waste consisted of transport packaging such as woodpallets and corrugated cardboard, Mungersaid. GAME & FISHUnderground petroleum tanks Eleven years after the establishment of the Petroleum Tank Release Cleanup Fund, a billthat aims to help the Minnesota PollutionControl Agency (MPCA) finally bring all un-derground petroleum storage tanks into com-pliance passed the House March 9. The votewas 122-8. HF2722*/SF2756 , sponsored by Rep. Betty McCollum would al-low the MPCA to \"red tag\" underground pe-troleum tanks that are in violation of currentregulations. A red tag on the cap of a tank would prohibit delivery of petroleum until the violations havebeen corrected. \"The purpose of this bill is to address the problems of underground storage tanks,\"McCollum said. Petroleum from leaking tanks can seep into the groundwater supply and lead to extensivesoil and groundwater cleanup work and costlylitigation. \"The petrofund in this state has cleaned up thousands of leaky underground tanks since1987,\" McCollum said. \"This bill attempts toreduce the number of future leaky tanks.\" Gas station owners and other petroleum- dispensing facility operators would have untilDec. 31, 1998, before the red tag provisionstake effect. The bill now goes to the Senate. Hunting, fishing privileges A bill that aims to amend the Minnesota Constitution to protect hunting and fishingprivileges was approved March 11 by the Civiland Family Law Division of the House Judi-ciary Committee. \"I think that there are organized groups throughout the country who are attemptingto extinguish lawful taking of game and fish,\"said Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul),the bill's sponsor. \"I think, in Minnesota, manypeople place a very high value on their abilityto take game and fish, and this is an attempt tomake sure that ability is preserved and that theprivilege will be managed by law and regulation.\" While previous hearings on the matter had focused on the reasoning behind the constitu-tional amendment and its potential financialimplications, much of the March 11 discus-sion revolved around the specific wording ofthe amendment. HF3808 would submit the following con- stitutional amendment to voters in the 1998general election: \"Shall the Minnesota Consti-tution be amended to declare that the takingof game and fish is a valued part of our heri-tage, which shall be forever preserved, andthat this privilege shall be managed by law andregulation for the common good?\" Milbert assured committee members that it 0.08 Test HEALTH Prenatal alcohol abuse A bill that would authorize the voluntary reporting of prenatal alcohol abuse passed thefull House March 10 without provisions re-quiring mandatory treatment. The bill ( HF3184 ) would permit health care workers, counselors, and others working withpregnant women who may be abusing alcoholto report such instances of abuse to the localwelfare agency. The bill would require that the local welfare agency then conduct an assessment and offernecessary services to the pregnant woman. An earlier version of the bill would have made prenatal abuse of alcohol grounds forcivil commitment and required local welfareagencies to petition for commitment in caseswhere the woman fails to follow treatmentrecommendations. The civil commitment process is used to require individuals to accept health care when,because of mental illness or other reasons,they do not realize the need for treatment.Civil commitment usually prompts hospital- Kerri Anderson takes a sip of wine as StatePatrol Lt. David J. Graham keeps an eye on herand five other female volunteers whoparticipated in a controlled test March 6. Thetest demonstrated that petite women couldhave two 6-ounce glasses of wine in two hourswithout exceeding a blood-alcohol level of0.08 percent. Opponents of a bill that wouldreduce the legal blood-alcohol limit for driversfrom 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent claim thelegislation would target casual drinkers andnegatively affect alcohol sales at bars andrestaurants.is not his intention to interfere with AmericanIndian treaty rights, current gun control laws,or the ability of the Department of NaturalResources to impose license fees or protectgame and fish by placing limitations on har-vest seasons. \"There is nothing in here that would allow an individual to take game and fish under anymethod other than those prescribed by law,\"he added. Professor Howard Vogel, of the Hamline University School of Law, voiced concernsover the phrase \"shall be forever preserved.\" \"That language is stated in what we call affirmative terms,\" Vogel said. \"When statedin those terms, courts tend to expand theunderstanding of the right, and it creates thepossibility, contrary to what was said here,that there may be a duty upon the part ofMinnesota to ensure and guarantee the supplyof fish and game. \"I can imagine, for example, big litigation involving environmental groups on one side,animal rights people on the other, hunters andfishers in the middle of that, and the Legisla-ture wondering what happened.\" A similar bill ( HF326 by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) was heard earlierthis session by two House committees. Holstenis a co-sponsor of HF3808 . The bill now moves to the full Judiciary Committee.10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 13, 1998ization, which allows the individual to be monitored and effectively treated. Provisions requiring commitment in these cases were removed from the bill by the HouseJudiciary Committee before the legislationreached the House floor. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of the bill, said that he wanted to get toughresponses to prenatal alcohol abuse on thetable. \"The bill as introduced was a commitment bill,\" Skoglund said. \"I wanted to get the ideabefore the Judiciary Committee. It's now areporting bill, and it's voluntary reporting,not mandatory.\" The bill was passed on a 130-0 vote and now goes to the Senate. Hepatitis B vaccinations All children who enroll in kindergarten would need to be vaccinated against hepatitisB beginning in the 2000-2001 school year,under a bill headed for the governor's desk. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood), passed the HouseMarch 12. The vote was 107-15. Children in kindergarten through seventh grade also would have to be vaccinated begin-ning in the 2007-2008 school term, under thebill ( HF2681/SF2372* ). The legislation would exempt families who object to the vaccination for religious or otherreasons. Hepatitis B is caused by a virus and spread by contact with an infected person's blood orother body fluids. It can also be spread bysharing washcloths, razors, or needles and bythe process of tattooing. The disease causes liver inflammation and can lead to liver failure or cancer. Approximately 80 percent of infants are already vaccinated for the disease. Immuniz-ing the remaining children with a series ofthree shots would come at no cost to the state.Slawik told legislators on the House floor thevaccinations are covered under a federalprogram. From 1990 to 1995, there were 591 known cases of hepatitis B in Minnesota, with 30 ofthose cases occurring in children 17 or younger.But the disease can be symptom-free for years,and the exact number of carriers is unknown.Some carrying the virus do not learn they areinfected until they give blood or have a physi-cal examination.'Off-label' drug use Health plans would be required to cover \"off-label\" use of drugs prescribed for cancerpatients, under legislation that is headed forthe governor's desk. The House passed the bill ( HF1306/ SF1076* ) March 10 on a 132-0 vote. The amended language cleared the SenateMarch 11. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), would require health mainte-nance organizations and other health plans topay for off-label use of drugs for cancer pa-tients, as long as the drug is recognized as atreatment for cancer in standard medicalliterature. Cancer specialists have reported that about 10 percent of their patients do not receiveprescribed treatment even if the patient re-sponds to that treatment. The problem occurswhen the prescribed drug is not approved bythe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forcertain forms of cancer. Drugs often are approved by the FDA for specific treatments, and further research andclinical trials reveal the drugs are also benefi-cial for a broader scope of ailments than origi-nally believed. But drug companies do notresubmit these medications for FDA approvalbecause of the time and cost commitment. The legislation would not cover experimen- tal drugs used in cancer treatment, but it wouldprohibit all health plans, including Medicaresupplemental coverage, from refusing to payfor cancer treatments involving drugs that arealready on a plan's formulary. There are 27 other states with similar laws.

HF3148/SF2047* , sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls), passed the HouseMarch 9 on a 121-2 vote. The bill would authorize the owner of a manufactured home park to sell up to fiveused homes per year that are within the park'sboundaries. Currently, only real estate agents and li- censed dealers are permitted to sell manufac-tured homes in Minnesota. \"The problem in the past has been that some homes have such low value that realestate agents are not interested in listing them,\"Kubly said. \"Nobody likes to have a low-grade piece of property sitting in their park.\" The bill would be particularly helpful to those manufactured home park owners inrural areas, Kubly said. During a Feb. 17 hearing before the House Commerce, Tourism, and Consumer AffairsCommittee, Mark Brunner, of the MinnesotaManufactured Housing Association, said hisorganization supports the bill because it wouldenable park owners to more easily upgradetheir facilities. Brunner assured the committee that park owners would still be subject to current re-strictions on selling substandard housing. Housing options for seniors More housing facilities could be designated as elderly housing under a proposal that passedthe House March 10. The vote was 132-0. HF2779/SF2230* would expand the statu- tory definition of elderly housing as it appliesto the human rights law, bringing state lawinto compliance with federal statutes. Theeffect would be that more facilities could clas-sify as elderly housing exclusively. The bill would remove the requirement that elderly housing must provide facilities de-signed to meet social and physical needs, suchas recreation and meeting rooms. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley), sponsor of the bill, said that the additionalservices provided to tenants mean additionalcost in rent. \"These types of facilities often cause rent to be $100 to $300 higher than other facilities,\"he said. Chaudhary said that his bill would create more affordable housing options for seniors. The Senate passed the bill Feb. 12. The measure now goes to the governor. Health & human services bill A controversial ban on late-term abortions is included in the health and human servicesomnibus bill that passed the House March 9carrying a heftier price tag than it came inwith. The vote was 115-14. Thirty-five amendments attached to the bill (HF2868/SF3346* ) on the House floor added millions of dollars to the bottom line of a pieceof legislation that carried a $59.7 million pricetag when it emerged from the House Waysand Means Committee. Of the 134 House members, 75 signed a peti- tion March 11 indicating they would reject the11 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY bill if the abortion language is missing when the legislation returns from conference committee.The petition was given to House Speaker PhilCarruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) and the billsponsor, Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls). The most controversial policy portion of the bill centers on late-term or \"partial birth\"abortions and the abortion reporting proce-dures in the state. The bill includes language that would re- quire the commissioner of human services toreport the total number of abortions paid forwith state funds. The bill also would requiredoctors to report to the commissioner of healththe gestational age of each fetus at the time ofabortion. The reporting provisions were part of last year's omnibus health and human services billoriginally approved by the House but were notincluded in the Senate version. The final ver-sion of the bill that came out of conferencecommittee did not include the requirements. This year, the Senate has again passed an omnibus health and human services spendingbill without the abortion-related provisions. This year's House bill would go further than the proposed reporting requirements. The billwould make it a felony to perform late-termabortions. The penalty would be a maximumtwo-year sentence and $15,000 fine. The bill would allow late-term abortions only if the procedure is required to save themother's life. An amendment offered by Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), a practicing family doc-tor, reduced the maximum penalty from the15-year sentence and $50,000 fine originallyincluded in the bill. A separate amendment offered by Rep. Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) and in-cluded in the bill would prohibit medical clin-ics that counsel, refer, or perform abortionsfrom receiving family planning grants fromthe state's heath care access fund. At the end of floor debate on the omnibus bill, some legislators urged Greenfield to pro-tect the abortion language included in themeasure. \"Don't bring a bill back from conference committee without this language in it,\" saidRep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake). Greenfield responded that conference com- mittee work is \"about compromise\" and heoffered no guarantees. \"I generally have won more for the House than I've lost,\" Greenfield said. Another amendment that would have a large fiscal impact was approved by House mem-bers during floor debate. The provision wouldexempt dentists from a provider tax that fundsstate health programs. It is estimated that more than $12 million in Santino Jenkins and Tara Peterson, internsocial workers from St. Paul's GaltierElementary School and Cherokee HeightsElementary School, respectively, join a rally inthe rotunda March 12. The annual rally,sponsored by the Minnesota Chapter of theNational Association of Social Workers, is anopportunity to talk with legislators aboutsocial programs.Social workers rallystate revenue would be lost by excluding den-tists from the MinnesotaCare provider tax,which is a 1.5 percent tax on hospitals andhealth care providers that is used to fund thestate-subsidized insurance plan. Some estimates suggest the bill will carry a $100 million price tag if all current provisionsin the proposal survive. The bill now moves toconference committee. Here are some other highlights of the legis- lation. Any willing provider A somewhat less controversial amendment introduced by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) would allow any doctor or clinic tocontract with a health plan if the medicalprovider is willing to accept the terms andconditions of the plan. Some rural area residents have argued they can no longer see their family medical practi-tioners because these doctors and dentists arenot included in their health plan's providernetwork.Tunheim's \"any willing provider\" plan aims to remedy such problems. However, someargue the additional administration involvedwould increase health care costs, and otherscontend it would ultimately mean fewer peoplewill have health care because premium costswill rise. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) argued there is no need for the new language because mosthealth plans allow enrollees to extend theiroptions within a provider network by payingmore, but few people do so. Greenfield argued that health care costs would rise under Tunheim's plan and thechange would not mean better health care. Food safety There is also $3 million in the bill for a food safety initiative. This was part of the governor'sbudget request. The money is targeted towardstate efforts to improve food safety. Somefunds also would be used to study and protectagainst food-borne illness. Increasingly, fruits and vegetable are im- ported, and roughly half of food dollars arespent in restaurants, where food can be im-properly handled or stored. Dr. Michael Osterholm, state epidemiolo- gist for the Minnesota Department of Health,has told legislators this year that the supposed6,000 to 8,000 annual deaths connected withcontaminated food are underestimated. Osterholm also has said that at certain times of the year nearly 100 percent of fresh fruitsand vegetables available are grown in develop-ing nations. He has said if that produce werepurchased by Americans abroad, they wouldbe advised to boil and peel it before eating. Small town doctors House members approved an amendment by Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) thatwould reward medical schools that keep theirgraduates in the state to practice medicine. During committee hearings earlier this ses- sion, Huntley described the difficulty of at-tracting doctors to rural areas. His amendmentseeks a study to determine which state medicalschools tend to place their graduates in Min-nesota. The study would evaluate this place-ment over the previous 10 years. That information would then become part of the criteria used to determine the level ofstate funding for the medical school. Fighting cancer in women An amendment by Rep. Gail Skare (DFL- Bemidji) added nearly $400,000 to the amountin the original bill to pay for more cancerscreening and diagnostic services for women,particularly women who are typically12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 13, 1998underserved by the medical profession. The bill now requests a total of nearly $1.4 millionfor that expense. INDUSTRYINSURANCELAWRemoving employment barriers The House passed a bill March 11 calling for a resolution to be sent asking the U.S. Con-gress to remove Medicaid policy barriers toemployment for people with disabilities. Thevote was 118-9. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), states that current governmentpolicies, particularly those relating to Medic-aid, discourage people with disabilities fromworking. The resolution would urge the U.S. Con- gress to adopt Medicaid buy-in legislationthat would allow people with permanent dis-abilities to retain Medicaid coverage to ad-dress unmet health needs when they becomeemployed. Employee-based health care and govern- ment programs such as Medicare andMinnesotaCare do not typically cover long-term support needed by disabled people. The resolution also would ask that any Medicaid buy-in legislation require individu-als to take advantage of any affordable em-ployer-based health coverage and requireindividuals to purchase any needed Medicaidcoverage on a sliding fee scale, which would bebased on their ability to pay. A 1995 poll indicated two-thirds of dis- abled, unemployed people are eager to work,and technology is making that more possible.But 74 percent of working-age adults withsevere disabilities are unemployed. The resolution seeks congressional action to remove any policy barriers to employmentso more people with disabilities can reducetheir dependence on government programsand become taxpayers. The bill ( HF3258/SF2699* ) now goes to the governor's desk. New area code for St. Paul An effort to stop the Public Utilities Com- mission (PUC) from assigning a new areacode to St. Paul failed as an amendment of-fered on the House floor March 9. The amendment by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) aimed to halt the PUC fromproceeding to institute a new 651 area code forSt. Paul as of July 1, 1998. House membersvoted 75-54 against the amendment. The amendment was offered to HF2980 ,sponsored by Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), which also failed to find approval on the Housefloor. Jennings' bill would have required telephone service providers who are allowed to beginserving a telephone exchange with fewer than50,000 subscribers to offer services to every-one in that exchange within a year after serv-ing the first customer. The proposal was aneffort to keep companies from entering smallservice areas and plucking the choice, mainlycommercial telecommunications accountswhile ignoring most residential customers. Paymar argued that the new area code for St. Paul will create difficulties and possiblefinancial hardships for businesses, which, forinstance, would have to change their phonenumbers on all their published information,letterheads, and business cards. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) said, \"One reason we have this problem is not justa proliferation of phones but phone compa-nies.\" She said unused telephone numbers were assigned to each of these companies in blocksnumbering in the thousands. She said if thenumbers were not assigned in blocks, therewould be enough numbers for the near future,which could buy time to further study theissue. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) argued the area code issue is the job of the PUC, which hedescribed as a politically balanced, quasi-judi-cial, quasi-legislative body. He argued the PUCheld numerous hearings on the subject andthat it is not the job of legislators to review thework of the PUC. As for HF2980 , Jennings argued the legisla- tion offered \"what is good for the residentialpayer.\" He said there is concern residentialrates will rise if companies can enter an ex-change area and offer competitive rates to thearea's larger accounts. And he said bigger com-panies such as U.S. West opposed the legisla-tion, \"but they are big enough to find a way toprotect themselves and to be competitive.\" Medical equipment, supplies A bill that would require health plans to tell clients what medical equipment and suppliesare covered by insurance passed the HouseMarch 10. The vote was 130-0. HF2814 , sponsored by Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm), would specifythat health plans covering durable medicalequipment cannot limit that coverage to equip-ment used in the home.Those companies also would have to pro- vide coverage information to members, andupon request, prospective members. Under the bill, companies that cover du- rable medical equipment would have to dis-close general descriptions of their coverage,level available, prior authorizations, and aname and phone number of a staff member anenrollee can call to get proper informationabout things like prior authorization. The bill goes to the Senate. Special guardians, conservators The House passed a bill March 9 that would make changes to the special guardian andconservator hearing process. The vote was127-0. Guardians and conservators are appointed by the state courts to make decisions for adultswho are incapable of making decisions forthemselves, oftentimes individuals in nursinghomes. Special guardianships and conservatorships differ in that they are temporary arrange-ments designed to respond to short-term situ-ations. The bill ( HF1414/SF1151* ) would lengthen the time required to post notices for suchhearings and would require that the hearingbe held within two weeks of the notice. The billwould also require that petitioners show aclear need for the appointment. The bill wouldalso limit these appointments to 30 days. Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin) said he is sponsoring the bill to address concerns broughtto him by families who wished to challengesuch appointments. Leighton said that members of a family in his legislative district sought to contest theappointment of a third party to make deci-sions for their father, who was living in anursing home. Leighton said that the family had to wait a month and a half for the court to hear theircase. During that time, the father did notreceive important pain relieving medication,and the family was powerless to do anythingabout it. The bill, which the Senate approved Feb. 23, now goes to the governor.

Legislation sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) is designed to promote both con-venience for bicycle riders and an outlet forcreativity. HF3296/SF2729* passed the House March 11 on a 122-8 vote. It would allow advertising,public art, and information signage on bicycleracks, if the placement does not create anunsafe situation. The legislation aims to address a situation in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis,where five bicycle racks have been installedand as many as four more are expected to beinstalled this year. Minneapolis City Councilwoman Lisa McDonald said the city is trying to promotebicycle riding but has found bicycle ridersprefer to chain their bikes close to the busi-nesses they frequent. She said the riders feelthis allows them to keep an eye on their bikeswhile shopping. So the city has a goal to install innovative bike racks on each block, where riders canchain their bikes but remain close to them.However, enabling legislation was needed toallow artwork and advertising on the racks. The Uptown area is known as a location for art house theaters, popular restaurants and Three-year-old Jaley tugs her mother, Mary Beth Balzart, into the rotunda as the rest of theirearly childhood family education group from Stillwater arrives March 10 for the \"Early ChildhoodParent Rally Day\" at the Capitol.This waybars, and shops that cater to a young clientele.McDonald said the city wants art and adver-tising on the bike racks that would help theracks blend with the area's atmosphere andstore fronts. The bill now moves to the Senate. Aircraft safety resolution Some aviation experts are concerned that airplane repair facilities in foreign countriesuse defective parts or do substandard repairwork on U.S. airplanes. An act before the U.S. Congress aims to tighten controls on these repair facilities. The Minnesota House passed a bill March 11 that calls for the state to send aresolution memorializing President Clintonand Congress to enact that federal legislation,called the Aircraft Repair Station Safety Act of1997. HF3250 , sponsored by Rep. Edwina Garcia (DFL-Richfield), passed on a 130-0 vote. The resolution would support a congres- sional effort to force foreign repair facilities touse the same standards that apply to domesticaircraft repair procedures and parts. The federal legislation would apply to re- pair stations that service aircraft that operatein the U.S. The act would revoke certificationof any repair facility that purposely usesuncertified or substandard parts. Opponents of the federal legislation fear itcould induce aviation authorities in foreign countries to quit certifying U.S. repair sta-tions. HF3250 now moves to the Senate. \"Testosterone and alcohol\" are the real problems, said Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St.Paul). Osthoff was responding to a motion made by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) during dis-cussion of the omnibus environment, naturalresources and agriculture finance bill(HF3799/SF3353* ) before the House Ways and Means Committee Feb. 27. Finseth offered an amendment that would remove language making snowmobiles withmetal studs illegal. Osthoff told the committee that the lan- guage was necessary because state trails androads are being destroyed by the metal studs.He said it was unfortunate that a fewsnowmobilers ruin it for the rest of them. Andhe characterized these violators as young menwho use alcohol and ride their snowmobiles inillegal areas. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) didn't miss a beat. \"Would it shorten it to just say the problem is 'studs'?\" Bishop said. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) sponsors a bill that calls for \"youth-orienteddriver improvement clinics\" for traffic viola-tors who are 25 years old and under. The bill(HF2532 ) provides for graduated driver's li- censes for Minnesotans who are 15 to 18 yearsold. Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) said, dur- ing a House Transportation and Transit Com-mittee hearing, that he didn't think drivers intheir 20s need to attend clinics that would bepart of a program aimed at teen drivers. If the bill passed as written and Stang were involved in a traffic violation, it would meanStang would have to attend one of the clinics.He's 23.

Minnesota's first lieutenant governor was a bit of an entrepreneur who didn't compro-mise cherished personal beliefs, or his family,for work. And much like present-day, resilientfinancier Donald Trump, Holcombe rose fromthe ashes, almost literally, to remake himself. A sturdy Dutchman with gray eyes and chest- nut hair that thinned in later years, Holcombewas born in Lambertville, N.J., in 1804. In thetradition of the times, Holcombe was bred toa profession; his was that of a carriage maker.But he didn't stay in the profession \u2014 or inNew Jersey \u2014 for long. He was married in Utica, N.Y., in 1826 and moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1829, where hecontinued the carriage trade. But fire reduced hisColumbus wheelwright shop to embers. He ral-lied from that disaster only after relocating to St.Louis, a town of about 5,000 at the time. As a member of a firm \u2014 Strother, Holcombe & Co. \u2014 he began to make variousinvestments, including a steamboat. Holcombecaptained the boat \u2014 dubbed \"Olive Branch\"\u2014 and did the job his way. He had become a devout Presbyterian, and accordingly, he refused to work from sun-down on Saturday until sundown on Sunday.So when Saturday evening rolled around onhis first 300-mile trip upstream from St. Louisto Galena, Ill., Holcombe stopped the boatand tied up. The delay irritated some passengers and prompted several to switch to another steamer.When the Sabbath ended, Holcombe resumedhis excursion with the remaining clients. Eventually, the Olive Branch passed the other steamer, which had become stuck on asandbar. Those who had abandonedHolcombe were stranded, while the OliveBranch steamed toward Galena. Holcombe said despite his refusal to travel on Sunday, he made one more round trip toGalena than any of his rivals that first year andearned nearly enough in one season to pay forhis boat. Widowed by 1839, he moved to Stillwater, which was then a portion of the WisconsinTerritory. He became proprietor of the St.Croix Falls Lumber Company, and he dabbledin steamboats and other commercial interests.He also began ancestors intopolitics.William Holcombe . . . State's first lieutenant governor led balanced life Holcombe came from a long line of assem- blymen, representatives to the Continental Congress, and soldiers in the ContinentalArmy. In 1846, after remarriage, he was a member of the First Constitutional Convention of Wis-consin. It was his first political role. He wasreputed to be a sound political economist anda radical Democrat with a keen interest ineducation. His plan for territorial boundarieswas the one adopted by the convention. In 1848, Holcombe was Secretary of the First Convention in Stillwater, the purpose ofwhich was to organize a new territory. He wasone of five who petitioned Congress to createthe Territory of Minnesota from land that hadbeen part of the Wisconsin Territory but wasnot included in the state of Wisconsin. Holcombe was a member of the 1857 con- vention which formed the Constitution ofMinnesota, and he took an active part in delib-erations. His two-year stint as lieutenant gov-ernor under fellow Democrat Henry Sibleybegan in 1858, but perhaps was not the hall-mark of his political career. The lieutenant governor's office existed to provide a successor to the governor should theposition become vacant. It was a part-time jobthat also involved presiding over the upperhouse of the Legislature. State records showthat after the first legislative session adjournedin 1858, Holcombe received $200 for presid-ing over the Senate.Holcombe's role as receiver of the U.S. Land Office at Stillwater in 1849 could be argued tohave been more prestigious. The receiver's jobwas considered to be very important.Holcombe and his son Edwin, a clerk, re-corded the original plats of Minneapolis andSt. Paul. Holcombe held the receiver's jobtwice as long as he did the office of lieutenantgovernor. Holcombe made other contributions to the public good. He helped locate the first tworoads in the St. Croix Valley, and built a mis-sion on a six-acre tract of land near Stillwater.He was largely instrumental in creating theFirst Church of Stillwater, where he was anelder. When he left the post of lieutenantgovernor, he became an active member of theState Normal School Board. It was said Holcombe always made plenty of time for friends and family, and his home wasthe gathering place for them. It was at home \u2014while mayor of Stillwater \u2014 that he died ofapoplexy in 1870. He was 66.

Photo courtesy Minnesota Historical Society15 March 13, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Sandy Donovan Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) says eight years in the Legislaturehave not dimmed his East Sidesensibilities. \"But that's something my mother has always worried about,\" he said.\"She worried when I went to college, she wor-ried when I went to law school, and she wor-ried when I came here that I'd stop going tochurch every week.\" He hasn't disappointed her, but he says his Irish Catholic mother is happy that her son isstepping down as a legislator this year. \"She's excited that I won't have to vote on any more abortion questions,\" he said. Farrell'spro-choice votes have been less than popularin his mother's neighborhood. But while she's pleased to see him leaving the Capitol, his mother was partially respon-sible for his decision to first run for the House,in 1990, at age 30. After his father died in 1989, Farrell said his mother had an incredibly difficult time secur-ing both health insurance and her latehusband's railroad pension. Farrell came to the House hoping to make changes that would spare other families suchdifficult situations, and he has concentratedon advocating for working people during hisfour terms. He has sponsored bills aimed at improving the state's child-protection system, at reduc-ing violence in schools, and at increasing vic-tims' rights. \"I am who I am,\" he said. \"I'm a third generation East Sider.\" He's also a juvenile prosecutor for Hennepin County and a former assistant public defenderfor Ramsey County \u2014 and the only legislatorto have tried a felony trial before a jury as botha prosecutor and a public defender. \"I represent hardworking folks who, if they came down here [to the Capitol], would beangered by the lack of backbone that's shown,\"he said. Backbones, or lack thereof, serve as a yard-Rep. Jim Farrell . . . Legislator exits speaking of family, friends, mentors stick for Farrell in assessing his colleagues. \"The saddest thing is to watch people get their arm twisted, and to see them vote againstsomething they passionately believe in,\" hesaid. He's quick to point out the strong charac- ters of the many legislators he counts as men-tors and friends. \"[Rep.] Mary Murphy has been a good mentor,\" he said. \"She taught me the impor-tance of trusting people. And if you want realchange, you've got to build consensus andtrust.\" Along with Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), Farrell lists Reps. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester),Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), and ThomasPugh (DFL-South St. Paul) as mentors. \"And there are members that I don't think I've ever voted with but that I respect becauseI've watched them stand up and say what theythink,\" Farrell said. He says he's built friendships across both party and regional lines during his time in theHouse.\"But the best thing about being here has been getting to know Steve Trimble,\" he said.\"For the last two years he's played Santa Clausat Christmas at our house, and although mytwo daughters don't know it's him, they'vereally developed a bond.\" Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) represents a House district bordering Farrell's. Farrell says he'll miss his colleagues when he leaves the House but he won't miss the lack ofcontrol over his schedule. \"Sadly, I know there are some people here that I probably won't see again,\" he said. \"ButI have a six-year-old daughter in dance who Ilove to watch, and I know I'll have fun justwatching my four-year-old twisting dadaround her little finger.\" Still, it's unlikely that Farrell's schedule will measurably lighten when the 1998 LegislativeSession ends. He's running for Ramsey Countyattorney this year, seeking the DFL endorse-ment in May. He has said that he will abide bythe party's endorsement.

Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston) has been in the House since 1985,and he now believes it's time tomove on. \"I've learned about the process,\" he said. \"You begin to think maybe you needsomebody with a fresh sense of things, eventhough you're probably more knowledgeablethan you were when you started.\" Olson, 60, was born and raised in Fosston, in the Red River Valley, where he owns a1,000-acre farm, raising potatoes, barley,wheat, and livestock. He has announced he will not run for re- election this fall and that he will become ex-ecutive director for the Agricultural UtilityResearch Institute in Crookston. \"I came here in the middle of the farm crisis [of the mid-1980s] and we did a good job withthe interest buy-down and mediation pro-grams. Those were things that were prioritiesthen,\" he said. Olson cited the lack of time for his children and his own pursuits as factors in his decisionnot to run again. Besides, he said, it wasn't necessarily his idea to run for state Legislature in the firstplace. \"People came to me and wanted me to run,\" he said. \"I was probably the last of eight can-didates that entered.\" Olson had farmed and worked for the agri- cultural industry as president of the AmericanSheep Council before he was elected in No-vember 1984. Over the years, Olson has worked on House committees focusing on taxes, education,transportation, and local government con-cerns. He currently chairs the Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Division of the HouseRep. Edgar Olson . . . Retiring member to head ag utility research institute Taxes Committee, which has carried a heavyworkload in the days of budget surpluses andtax-cut proposals. He also served as chair of the House Ethics Committee earlier in his legislative career. Olson's wife, Phyllis, died seven years ago. He has two grown children, one living in NewYork and the other in Eden Prairie. He said hewants to see more of them in his post-legisla-tive life. \"I'm like all the goal-dedicated people that we've had here. It seems that you're carving abig chunk of your life in here and it gets to thepoint where it's all-consuming,\" he said. \"Be-tween the sessions and everything that goeson, every time you try to plan things you'vegot a conflict.\" Olson said he is going to miss the Legisla- ture and the friends he has made in the House. \"I look forward to visiting them and seeing them on a personal basis,\" he said, adding thathe counts all legislators as friends. \"If there's anything that deals with agricul- tural issues I'll remain in close contact,\" hesaid. Still, Olson acknowledged that he will miss some aspects of life as a legislator. \"There are a lot of people that you have a common bond with, especially people in theagricultural areas,\" he said. And that's his first love, farming. He said he has tried to devote his legislative career toserving his constituents and other rural Min-nesotans and to helping farmers and farmcommunities. \"I've been able to support the people and their interests,\" Olson said.

Jan. 9 - March 12, 1998 CH252-CH273 HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFOnce a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sentto the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when consid-ering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within anappropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differenteffects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsBills await governor's action and files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required. But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sinedie\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a datecertain\"). If the governor does not sign a billwithin this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto.\" Thegovernor is not required to provide a reasonfor the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he or sheobjects. As with all vetoes (save pocket ve-toes) the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the veto with the re-turned bill. Here, too, the timetable is either14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, orwithin three days after the governor receivesthe bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

Lake of the WoodsKittson Roseau Stone Sherburne Swift KandiyohiWrightAnoka Meeker were ap-proximately equal in popu-lation, each containing about 32,650 people. By 1995, only 40 ofthe 134 districts were within 3 percentagepoints of their 1992 population. Such population changes also could be seen in the state's 67 Senate districts and inits eight congressional districts. Variationsof this sort are not unusual; they reflect themobility of our society. To keep the districts equal, the Minne- sota Legislature must redraw congressionaland legislative districts every 10 years fol-lowing the census. The next round of re-districting will start after the 2000 census,and the Legislature is required to have thenew districts in place before the 2002election. After the census establishes the popula- tion trends, the U.S. Congress and theMinnesota Legislature will reassign thenumber of districts in a given area basedon population changes \u2014 a process calledreapportionment. Areas that make sig-nificant gains in population will get newdistricts, and areas that decrease in popu-Population shifts redefine legislative district boundaries lation will lose existing districts. According to predictions made by the Congressional Research Service, Minne-sota will probably maintain eight congres-sional districts. Other midwestern states\u2014 including Wisconsin, Illinois, andMichigan \u2014 may have to give up districtsbecause of decreased or negative popula-tion growth. The fast-growing sunbeltstates like Arizona, Georgia, and Texascould gain as many as two congressionaldistricts each.State legislative districts also will need to be reapportioned. If population trendscontinue, the Minnesota Department ofPlanning predicts the central cities of Min-neapolis and St. Paul each may have togive up a legislative district and the IronRange may lose half of one district. Due toits population spurt, the suburban metro-politan area could gain as many as two andone-half districts. The process of drawing the lines that separate districts is called redistricting.Unlike reapportionment, which is basedon an agreed-upon formula, the redis-tricting process can be a political battle.The process can be used to ensure that oneparty has the advantage in elections. Forexample, lines can be drawn to split aneighborhood that tends to vote for oneparty, thereby dividing those votes be-tween two districts and decreasing thosevoters' effectiveness. In Minnesota, as elsewhere, partisan- ship has often accompanied redistricting.The past three attempts at redistricting in1972, 1982, and 1992 were finally settledby the federal courts because they had notbeen resolved by the election deadline.

When Fort Sumter, S.C., was attacked on April 12, 1861, President Lincolnasked for 75,000 troops to defend the Union. Gov. Alexander Ramsey, who was in Washington, D.C., at the time, met with Lincoln to commit the service of 1,000 men from the state militia. Lt. Gov. Ignatius Donnelly received a telegraph in St. Paul from Ramsey on April 14 and called a meeting that evening with the St. Paul Pioneer Guards. Josias R. King was the firstto sign up. He made history that evening by becoming the first to volunteer for the Unionin the Civil War. At 10 a.m. the next day, Aaron Greenwald, James W. Groat, and five other citizens were the first to volunteer under former territorial governor Willis Gorman in Anoka, Minn. The Minnesotans memorialized in bronze in the Capitol (see related story, page 14) also represent forgotten names of hundreds of enlisted men, among them Josias King's cousin,Levi, who was wounded at Gettysburg. Others were well-known. Among them were Gov.Henry Sibley and Gorman. Another was Knute Nelson, who served in the 1st WisconsinRegiment as a corporal, became governor of Minnesota in 1893, then served as a U.S.senator. Of the 259 blacks noted in the 1860 census, 104, or almost one-half of the African- American population in Minnesota, volunteered to serve in 1861, even though they werenot able to vote in the state until 1870. Minnesotans fought successfully in other military units, but it was the 1st Minnesota under the Army of the Potomac that was successful at Manassas, Bull Run, and otherbattles. Still, the bloody Gettysburg battle stands out in state history. Josias and Levi King, Greenwald, Groat, and 258 others led the charge of the 1st Regiment on July 2 and 3, 1863. Fifteen minutes into battle, 215 of them were dead.Greenwald was one of them. Many Civil War memorials have been dedicated around the state. They include the monument to Knute Nelson in front of the Capitol steps and a makeshift wooden staff thatcarried the tattered U.S. flag at Gettysburg, displayed with the flag in the Capitol rotunda. The staff \u2014 its wood half Union and half Confederate \u2014 is held with a leather strap that patched together two fragments of flag staffs found on the battlefield after the originalbearers fell. Other Civil War monuments include: a plaque erected to Greenwald, Groat, and others that is located across the street from the old Anoka County Court House; a monument toCol. William Colvill in Cannon Falls, Minn.; and the Josias R. King monument, found afew hundred yards north of the St. Paul Cathedral. King posed for its creation, and it was completed in 1903. He was among the 4,000 who attended the dedication to \"perpetuate the memory of the Union soldiers and sailors of theWar of 1861-1865. Their suffering and sacrifice exalted the chorus.\" \u2014 LeClair Grier Lambert3 March 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY Minnesota teens currently can acquire a driver's license with full driving privileges at age 16, but a bill moving through the House is designed to introduce restrictions on teen-age drivers. Minnesota couldjoin the ranks of over half of the states that already have some sort of graduated licensing system forteens.By Jim Thielman For teen-agers, a driver's license spells But for 669 California teens in1994, a driver's license meant the end of their lives. So although California is already among 26 states with some form of graduated teenlicensing, starting July 1 the state will placeadditional conditions and restrictions on driv-ing privileges for young people. Minnesota teens have no graduated licens- ing restrictions of any kind, but a bill ap-proved by the House Ways and MeansCommittee March 16 aims to introduce somenew requirements. A similar bill stalled in the House Transpor- tation and Transit Committee a year ago, andits companion bill in the Senate never came upfor a floor vote.Graduated licensing restrictions . . . Bill requires teens to 'graduate' through driving stages The graduated licensing laws on the books in 26 states require young drivers to \"gradu-ate\" through stages of restricted driving be-fore they are allowed to get their unrestrictedlicenses. The restrictions applied in other states of- ten include a mandatory supervised drivingperiod, night driving curfews, and trainingthat involves a certain amount of night driv-ing experience.Nighttime driving is a particularly high-risk activity for 16- to 19-year-olds. Accident stud-ies reveal that only about 20 percent of milesdriven by teens is accumulated between 9 p.m.and 6 a.m., but almost half of their fatal crashesoccur during those hours. Auto accidents are the leading cause of death for 15- to 20-year-olds, according to theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administra-tion (NHTSA). Drivers aged 16 and 17 are 18 times more likely to be killed in traffic accidents thanadults aged 30 to 34, according to NHTSA.Twenty-five percent of teen drivers will beinvolved in an auto accident, and 5 percent ofthose collisions will lead to serious injury ordeath. Teen drivers also are more likely to be in- volved in single-vehicle incidents. The bill teen driving,create for traffic violators under age 18, andcreate a three-stage licensing process. Under the bill, drivers in Minnesota would have to be at least 16 years old and have alearner's permit for six months to apply for aprovisional license.Currently, 16-year-old drivers in Minne- sota can drive unsupervised at any hour. Butunder the graduated licensing system, drivingbetween midnight and 5 a.m. would be re-stricted, with some exceptions. The restriction, and the exceptions, have generated much debate among lawmakers. Provisional license holders would be al- lowed to drive between midnight and 5 a.m.for employment, religious, education, or lim-ited social purposes. The young drivers wouldneed a certificate stating the nature of theexception, and the certificate would have to besigned by a parent, guardian, or employer. The exceptions to the midnight driving cur- few have grown as the bill has moved throughthe House committees process. For instance,the original bill excepted school-sponsoredevents from the nighttime driving limits, butduring discussion in the Ways and MeansCommittee, Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) askedabout hockey and ice skating practices. She said ice hockey \"captains' practices\" are not school-sponsored events. They are calledat the discretion of the team, and they areoften held after midnight, when ice time isavailable. She also indicated that many figureskaters drive to indoor facilities very early inthe morning for the same reason. The bill was amended to include such ac- tivities on the list of exceptions to the drivingcurfew. Other legislators argued that a teen attend- ing a film that begins at 9:30 p.m. is unlikely toget home before the midnight deadline. Thatactivity does not fall under any of the bill'sstated exceptions. Another provision in the bill would require that a driver with a learner's permit could beaccompanied in the front seat by only thesupervising licensed driver. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), the Ways and Means Committee chair, said the provi-sion would mean problems for parents whoare pickup truck owners. \"I can't have one son drive and another as passenger then?\" he asked. Legislators were told in that situation the supervising driver should be behind the wheel. The bill has drawn concern from some law- makers, but Chaudhary's plan is supported bythe Minnesota State Patrol, Mothers AgainstDrunk Driving, the Department of Public4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998 By Jim Thielman In former Rep. Kathleen Vellenga's mind, there is rarely anything bad about a goodargument. That's certainly one thing shemisses since she left the House in 1994. \"Having something to say and standing up on the floor of the House and saying it,that's one thing I really miss,\" she said in arecent interview. On the other hand, Vellenga's career as project coordinator of the St. Paul/RamseyCounty Children's Initiative has itsadvantages. \"I don't wake up in the middle of the night as much. I don't feel like the wholestate's watching me,\" she said. A Macalester graduate in education, she taught school and volunteered in child-abuse prevention programs before shesought political office. When voters in Vellenga's St. Pauldistrict approachedher about running forstate representative in1980, her thought wasthat she was just anormal person. \"After I got over to the House, I realizedeveryone was,\" shesaid. Vellenga was just a kid from Nebraska,but uncle TomOsborne was a statesenator there. (Thesenator's son andVellenga's cousin wasthe Tom Osbornewho retired this year after 25 seasons ashead football coach at the University ofNebraska.) When first elected, Vellenga set her goal at three terms in the Minnesota House at atime when women were a small minority inthe House. The DFLer never expected lead-ership roles would follow. However, during her seven terms as a lawmaker, Vellenga chaired the HouseVellenga maintains former goalsin 'Children's Initiative' position Education Finance Committee and theHouse Judiciary Committee. When Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) stepped down as House speaker in 1993,Vellenga's name was mentioned as apotential successor. \"I knew I did not want to do that,\" Vellenga said. \"Sure, it would be fun upthere running the floor sessions and, sure,it would be fun to be that influential onissues. But you've got to be out there cam-paigning for 134 House seats, becauseyou've got to keep that majority. \"I wasn't going to do that. I never even liked my own campaigns.\" She says her most important legislative work was \"synthesizing the message thatwe wanted to spend one dollar on preven-tion for every dollar we spent on correc-tions. We know the first three years in a child's life are the most important, and we wanted to get that message out.\" Now, she pursues that social goal at an- other level. In hindsight, Vellenga said she \"was get- ting cynical [in the House]. It was time togo.\" But she believes her years in the Housegave her a breadth of knowledge that makesit easier to do her current work. Former Rep. Kathleen Vellenga, who was once a teacher, now works asproject coordinator of the St. Paul/Ramsey County Children's Initiative.Safety, and more than a dozen other groups. The Senate has passed a graduated licensing bill this year without the curfew language. And the public seems to favor graduated licensing. An April 1997 Minneapolis Star Tribune poll of 800 adults revealed 79 percent of re-spondents favored a midnight driving curfew. Under the House bill, the minimum age for a full driver's license would be 17. In the Star Tribune poll, 54 percent favored raising that age limit from 16 to 17. The attempt to restrict younger drivers is not just a Minnesota effort. Under the enhanced California law that takes effect July 1, a 16-year-old with a provi-sional license will have to be accompanied byparent or licensed driver 25 or older in orderto drive between midnight and 5 a.m. Cur-rently, in California, the restriction appliesonly to those who are 15 and a half and have a learner's permit. The California measure also will incorpo- rate a trend toward combining driver's educa-tion with graduated licensing. Worldwide research has indicated that people who merely graduate from driver'seducation courses do not have fewer subse-quent crashes than drivers who learned with-out formal driver education. The belief of experts is that training com- bined with a graduated licensing system is thesafest way to introduce teens to various driv-ing conditions. The first model for teen graduated licensing was developed more than 20 years ago by theNHTSA. The NHTSA and the AmericanAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administratorsare pushing for entry-level staged licensingand education in all 50 states.

March 12 - 19, 1998 AGRICULTURE Bill to study hemp defeated A bill calling for a study to determine the feasibility of allowing Minnesota farmers togrow industrial hemp was soundly defeated inthe House March 19. The vote was 81-49against the plan. Leading the charge to defeat the bill was Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), a Minne-apolis police officer, who said he was uncom-fortable with the fact that industrial hempcomes from the same family as marijuana, anillegal, controlled substance in the U. S. since1937. Bill sponsor Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said the study would not open the door to thelegalization of marijuana. But, she said, indus-trial hemp might open some financial doorsfor farmers in Minnesota because it can beused for a variety of products such as paper,clothing, fiber board, twine, birdseed, and oil. Marijuana and industrial hemp carry the scientific classification of cannabis sativa , but they are significantly different plants, accord-ing to information that has been supplied bythe North American Industrial HempCouncil. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the intoxi- cating drug in both marijuana and hemp.Marijuana contains 3 percent to 20 percentTHC, while hemp contains 0.05 percent to 1percent THC. Hemp-based THC in them. ( HF349/SF1181* ) also had the ap- proval of the Minnesota Agri-Growth Coun-cil, which is \"hardly a liberal think tank,\"Kahn said. \"I don't want to pretend that this bill will save the farm community. It's supporting theiruse of a crop which can be uniquely successfulin Minnesota,\" she said. Stanek said law enforcement officials be- lieve that legalization of hemp might not be agood idea. \"How do I explain going down the slippery slope of allowing hemp to be grown whenmost people associate it with marijuana?\"Stanek asked. Kahn said, \"You tell them the first draft of the Declaration of Independence was writtenon hemp paper. You tell them that Betsy Ross'first American flag was sewn with hempfabric.\"BANKINGBUDGET BUSINESSRep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) said several studies conducted in other states concludedhemp's possibilities as a profitable crop weredubious. \"I feel upset that people say this will be a viable crop and save agriculture,\" she said.\"It's not been found viable \u2014 not for eco-nomic reasons, not for any reason. I have a realproblem with giving false hope to an agricul-tural community that needs real hope.\" House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) said it would be hard for law enforce-ment to tell the difference between industrialhemp and marijuana. \"I would think it would be an important step backwards in the war against drugs,\" hesaid. The Senate approved the hemp study bill last year. Checks in the mail The House passed a bill March 19 that would place some restrictions on the unsolicitedchecks that some financial institutions send toconsumers. The vote was 126-2. Bill sponsor Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said he recently received one such check \u2014 forthousands of dollars \u2014 in the mail. \"If that check would have been taken out of my mailbox and someone had taken it to thecheck-cashing place and cashed it, my lifewould have been miserable,\" he said. Consumers who find such checks in their mailbox are actually receiving loan solicita-tions, carrying interest rates as high as 30percent. Under the bill, no financial institution or lender could send such a check unless it com-plied with several new requirements. The checks would have to become void after 30 days, and information would have to besent with the check advising consumers todestroy the check if they do not use it. Consumers also would have to be told in plain terms that the check is a loan, and theloan agreement would have to be on the backof the check. If such a check is fraudulently cashed by someone other than the addressee, the con-sumer would be absolved from liability bysigning a statement saying he or she did notcash the check.\"There have been incidents where checks have been stolen,\" Haas said. \"We're puttingregulations in place in which the consumerwould be protected. There is no procedure inplace to protect me.\" The measure would allow an exception for prospective borrowers who already have anopen-end credit arrangement, such as a creditcard account, with a lender. The bill ( HF2016/SF2550 *) now goes to the governor. Tobacco lawsuit funds The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill March 16 that would requirethat any funds received from the state's law-suit against big tobacco go into the generalfund. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), spon- sor of the bill ( HF3314 ), told the committee that money reimbursed to the state should bedistributed by elected officials. He said hedidn't want the state of Minnesota to gothrough the same situation as in Texas. In January 1998, Texas received a settle- ment from cigarette makers in the amount of$15.3 billion. The Texas attorney general placeda portion of the funds in a foundation gov-erned by a board of directors. Texas state legislators argued that they alone had the constitutional authority to appropri-ate state revenues. After weeks of grandstand-ing and legal challenges, the state attorneygeneral agreed to turn the funds over to theLegislature. Anderson's bill now goes to the House floor. Minnesota's franchise law A House panel has approved a bill that aims to prevent Northwest Airlines from using a1997 law to its advantage in a court battle. The 1997 Legislature passed special legisla- tion for Northwest Airlines that retroactivelyexempted airline carriers from Minnesota'sfranchise law. The state franchise law provides franchisees with some degree of protection against un-warranted termination of agreements withtheir parent companies.6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998Controversy erupted when it was discov- ered recently that the retroactive exemptionhad an effect on pending litigation againstNorthwest Airlines. A $30 million lawsuit filed in Maine in 1994 by Northeast Express Airlines and PrecisionValley Aviation claims that Northwest Air-lines violated Minnesota's franchise law whenit dropped the two \"feeder\" airlines, forcingthem into bankruptcy. Some legislators have questioned whether Northwest Airlines withheld knowledge of thelawsuit before the Legislature passed the 1997law. The House Commerce, Tourism and Con- sumer Affairs Committee approved a bill(HF3841 ) March 12 that would specify that the 1997 franchise exemption does not applyto any agreements that were subject to litiga-tion prior to passage of the law. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the bill's sponsor, also carried the 1997 legislation. \"It was not my intention to get in the way of pending litigation,\" he said. Joseph V. O'Donnell, of Portland, Maine, is the bankruptcy trustee of Northeast ExpressAirlines and Precision Valley Aviation.O'Donnell said the retroactive repeal of thefranchise law seriously damaged his court case. Northwest Airlines brought the 1997 legis- lation to the table as a \"housekeeping\" mea-sure, O'Donnell said. \"They have not used it as housekeeping in Maine,\" he said. \"I think it was material to the450 people who lost their jobs.\" Robert Benner, a Northwest Airlines lobby- ist, said the bill would not affect the Mainelawsuit. \"There are a number of other issues,\" Benner said. \"Northwest will continue to pursue itsrights under the law without the benefit of thefranchise amendment passed in 1997.\" The committee also voted to send along a related bill ( HF3842 ) without recommenda- tion. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson(DFL-Int'l Falls), would repeal the 1997 air-line carrier franchise exemption altogether. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) expressed concern over once again subjecting airlines tothe franchise law. Airlines need to have the option of drop- ping their feeder airlines when safety concernsbecome insurmountable, McElroy said. \"I would remind the committee that it was Northwest Airlines that grounded Express Onebefore the [Federal Aviation Administration]did,\" McElroy said in reference to a 1993commuter airline crash in Hibbing. \"The FAAis certainly important, but they are not theonly link in the safety issue.\" Both bills are headed for the House Rules and Legislative Administration Committee.CHILDRENLimited partner withdrawals The House passed a bill March 13 that would alter regulations by which a limited partner inan investment may withdraw from the part-nership. The bill passed 132-0. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Macklin (R-Lakeville), would allow limited partners towithdraw from an investment partnership onlyif permitted by the written partnership agree-ment. If the agreement contained no with-drawal authority, the limited partner couldnot withdraw. Current law allows limited partners to with- draw unless it is specifically forbidden in thewritten partnership agreement. Limited partners invest in a partnership but are usually not subject to the same legal liabil-ity to which the general partners are subject. The bill would apply to partnerships formed after July 31, 1998, and to partnerships formedbeforehand that contain a written provisionallowing withdrawal. HF2507/SF3036* goes to the governor. Child protection system The House approved a bill March 13 which would make significant changes to the state'schild protection system. The vote was 128-0. Sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL- St. Paul), the bill ( HF2985 ) seeks to address issues that have recently come to light regard-ing the state's ability to protect children whoare in danger. In January 1998, the legislative auditor re- leased an evaluation of the state's child protec-tion system. The auditor found that servicesvaried greatly from county to county and thatno external oversight exists to monitor theactions in these cases. The auditor suggested numerous approaches to reforming the cur-rent state of the system. Entenza's bill incorporates many of the sug- gestions, along with changes recently man-dated by federal law. The bill would create amore uniform statewide system and attemptto provide a sufficient level of oversight tomake sure that the cases are handledeffectively. The bill also seeks to place children more quickly into permanent living situations,either with a parent or another alternativehome. In addition, the bill would require thatthe Department of Human Services design astatewide child protective services plan withinput from the county-administered pro-grams. The bill now goes to the Senate. Children's endowment fund The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill March 16 that aims to create apermanent endowment fund to improve thephysical, intellectual, and emotional develop-ment of Minnesota's youngest citizens. HF3167 , sponsored by Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood), is headed for a vote on theHouse floor. The bill would submit the following consti- tutional amendment to voters in the 1998general election: \"Shall the Minnesota Consti-tution be amended to create a permanentendowment fund to enhance the develop-ment of young children through the age offour?\" Potential sources of initial funds for the endowment include surplus dollars in statecoffers and tax-deductible contributions fromindividuals, corporations, and foundations. Money in the endowment fund would be earmarked for several purposes, including Rep. Rich Stanek's 2-year-old daughter, Jennifer, plays at her father's desk in the Housechamber during the floor session March 16 .Peekaboo7 March 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYEMPLOYMENTENVIRONMENT DWIactivities that heighten public awareness of the importance of early brain stimulation andmore research into early childhooddevelopment. The fund would exist to supplement, not supplant, current spending on early child-hood education programs. Alcohol concentration Following two similar victories \u2014 one in Washington, D.C., and one in Washingtonstate \u2014 a proposal to lower Minnesota's bloodalcohol concentration standard was narrowlyapproved by the House Ways and Means Com-mittee March 16. The vote in committee was12-10. HF2389 , sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), would lower the per se bloodalcohol concentration limit from 0.10 percentto 0.08 percent. On March 4, the U.S. Senate adopted an amendment which would tie highway fund-ing to the 0.08 percent standard. If it becomeslaw, states that do not have the lower standardin place by 2001 would see a reduction infederal highway dollars. Later that same week, Washington state legislators passed a bill that would make Wash-ington the 16th state to enact the 0.08 percentlimit. The governor of Washington is expectedWorkplace breast-feeding The House passed a bill March 19 that would require businesses to make \"reasonable ef-forts\" to provide adequate private space andunpaid time off for new mothers to pumpbreast milk. The vote was 107-19. \"Many businesses are doing this already,\" said Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville),House sponsor of the bill. \"We're just trying toprovide a positive nudge.\" The bill would require employers to make available \"the nearest convenient and appro-priate room or other location, other than aWatercraft bill withdrawn A bill that would place restrictions on the operation of personal watercraft on Minne-sota lakes suffered a major setback on theHouse floor March 18. The so-called \"personal watercraft safety and courtesy act,\" sponsored by Rep. KrisHasskamp (DFL-Crosby), included a provi-sion that would have banned the operation ofpersonal watercraft on lakes of 100 acres orless. Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) offered a successful amendment to remove the pro-posed ban from the bill. In response to the 96-34 vote in favor of the amendment, Hasskampwithdrew her bill from consideration. \"Without a major influx of public opinion and people calling their legislators, it could bedead for the session,\" Hasskamp said after-ward. What remains of the bill includes measures that would shorten the hours for operation ofpersonal watercraft, prohibit the continuousoperation of a personal watercraft in the samearea for longer than 30 minutes, and assesscivil penalties for operators who violate per-sonal watercraft laws. \"If we do nothing this year . . the problem will get worse,\" Hasskamp said. fear thatroad rage will turn into water rage.\" Hasskamp said she has tried to accommo- date \"jet-sporters\" where she thought theyhad reasonable concerns, but \"people who do Olympic gold medalists Jenny Schmidgall of Edina, left , and Alana Blahosky, of St. Paul, are cheered by members of the House.

Under the bill, the break times would run concurrently with any other allotted breaks.Employers would not have to provide thebreaks if doing so would \"unduly disrupt theoperations\" of the business. Greiling noted that the bill purposely uses vague language and does not set penalties fornoncompliance. \"We're not trying to make this be an unrea- sonable request or burden,\" she said. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) successfully added an amendment specifying that busi-nesses would be held harmless if reasonableefforts to comply with the potential law hadbeen made. The bill also contains a provision, added in the Senate, that would clarify that breast-feed-ing is excepted from the crime of indecentexposure. The bill ( HF3459/SF2751* ) now goes back to the Senate.8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998FAMILY Joint parenting after divorce A new process for joint parenting following divorce is the centerpiece of the omnibus fam-ily law bill passed by the House March 16. Thevote was 106-25. The bill ( HF2784/SF2276* ), sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), combinesseveral bills the Civil and Family Law Divisionof the House Judiciary Committee heard thissession. The bulk of the bill is dedicated to Dawkins' parenting plan proposal (originally introducedas HF1323 ). The proposal would restructure state law to focus on joint decision-makingbetween the two divorced parents. Under current law, the courts establish cus- tody in situations where the placement of thechild is an issue after marriage dissolution.Courts designate a custodial parent, and alldecisions concerning the child are made bythat parent. Under the new language, parents involved in marriage dissolution proceedings would beprovided the option to compose a plan thatwould ensure significant participation by bothparents in all decision-making. The docu-ment would outline visitation and custodyissues for the child. Courts would then ap-prove the parenting plan. Dawkins said that his proposal is an attempt to separate certain decisions about the care ofthe child from other decisions following mar-riage dissolution.Transport packaging waste A new law aims to reduce theamount of transport packagingwaste that Minnesota's soft drinkindustry creates. In 1995, 22 percent of municipal solid waste consisted of transport packaging such as wood pallets and corru-gated cardboard, Rep. Willard Munger(DFL-Duluth), the House sponsor of the mea-sure, said during floor debate. The soft drink industry is considering a $15 million investment in reusable, recyclable plas-tic merchandise pallets to replace the woodpallets they currently use to transport theirgoods to retailers. The plastic pallets are expected to cost about $32 each, compared to $5 to $7 each for woodpallets. There is now a system in place where third parties collect used pallets from retail sites andthen resell them to soft drink companies. During a Feb. 17 committee hearing, Dave Locey, of the Minnesota Soft Drink As-sociation, said the third party collection sys-tem stands in the way of the transition fromwood to plastic. \"We're in the position of trying to make a pro-environmental system work,\" Locey said.\"What we want to do before we make this $15million investment in plastic pallets is makesure we can control them.\" Effective Aug. 1, 1998, third party collectors will be prohibited from taking plastic palletsthat are labeled as private property. The plastic pallets will have to clearly show the owner's name and address or telephonenumber, as well as a notice that the unautho-rized possession of the pallet is a violation ofstate law. The rightful owner of a stolen plastic pallet will be able to sue for damages equal to threetimes the cost of the pallet, in addition to legalexpenses. Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2696/SF2402*/CH282Signed by the governorthis don't understand that their fun in the sunis someone else's torture.\" The bill ( HF1169 ) was met with bipartisan opposition. \"Frankly, I think we need to be more toler- ant of each other's recreational interests,\" saidRep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook). Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said the bill would make Minnesota the \"Landof 3,000 Lakes\" because many lakes would beoff-limits to personal watercraft enthusiasts.Dawkins said that children too often be- come bargaining chips in the divorce negotia-tions and parents are unable to makeconcessions that they think are in the bestinterest of the child. \"In my own law practice, I've had fathers coming in saying, 'I think it's okay for Juniorto spend time at his mom's house,'\" Dawkinssaid. \"And I'd have to advise the father not tosay that in court.\" Dawkins said that his proposal is an attempt to maintain a significant relationship betweenthe child and both parents after a marriagedissolution. Initially, the bill called for the parenting plan option to be offered statewide. In itscurrent form, the bill would create a pilotproject and gives each judicial district thepower to decide whether or not to participatein the pilot. The Minnesota Supreme Court would then have the final say in whether or not the pilotprojects are initiated. The omnibus bill now goes to conference committee where legislators will work out thedifferences between the House and Senateversions of the bill. The Senate version doesnot address the parenting plan. The Fond du Lac sacred fire lodge drummers sing and pray on the steps of the Capitol during aspiritual gathering for the wolf.

PhyllisKahn (DFL-Mpls), who is sponsoring HF2970 . \"This brings them more in line with others,and it is cost-free to the state.\" The bill would give judges a 1.5 percent raise but would require them to increase theirpension fund contributions by 1.73 percent.The state would make up for paying the highersalaries because its own required contribu-tions to the pension fund would go down. The wage hike is necessary because the state constitution prohibits reducing the salary of asitting judge. Although the provision wouldstill lead to a slight drop in pay, Kahn said thatjudges have agreed to the arrangement andwould not rule it unconstitutional in court. \"The result is that we will be getting to better judicial pension policy at no cost to thestate and at small cost to judges,\" Kahn said. But some lawmakers objected to any in- crease in judges' salaries because the Legisla-ture granted them a 9 percent raise in 1997. Afailed amendment by Rep. Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) would have eliminated the raisebut left the provision calling for increasedpension contributions. \"Let's put it out there, and let's see if the judges rule it unconstitutional,\" Kraus said. \"Ithink [eliminating the raise] would be fair andI think fairness is important to all judges.\" The bill passed on a 90-40 vote and now goes to the Senate. Other provisions in the omnibus pension bill would: increase surviving-spouse benefits for the wife of a St. Paul building inspector killedwhile on duty last Christmas Eve; change the qualifications and filing deadlines for the state's part-time teacher pension pro-gram, allowing teachers to work up to 80percent of full-time hours and remain eli-gible for the program; and provide guidelines under which two public medical facilities may provide pension-re-lated payments if they are transferred toprivate ownership. The two facilities areLuverne Community Hospital in Luverne,Minn., and Arnold Memorial Hospital inAdrian, Minn.GOVERNMENT Claims against the state The family of a 14-year-old girl killed in 1991 by a convicted sex offender on his wayfrom prison to a halfway house would receivealmost $15,000 under a bill the House passedMarch 13. David and Gayle Johnson of Alexandria, Minn., filed a wrongful-death suit against thestate after their daughter was murdered by aconvict who had been released from St. Cloudprison five days earlier and ordered to reportto a halfway house in Minneapolis. He was notassigned an escort and did not show up at thehalfway house. Following the murder, the Legislature changed the law to require that escorts beprovided in similar situations, but the Minne-sota Supreme Court rejected the parents' claim. The Johnsons next turned for recourse to the Minnesota Legislature's Joint House-Sen-ate Subcommittee on Claims, which annuallyhears private restitution claims that have beenrefused by the courts or state governmentdepartments. This year's claims bill ( HF3830 ), sponsored by Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston), wouldauthorize payment of certain of those claimsagainst the state, as recommended by the sub-committee. The bill passed the House on a126-6 vote. In addition to the payment to the Johnsons, the bill would pay almost $24,000 to a BentonCounty deputy who in 1996 shot and killed asuspect in the murder of a St. Joseph policeofficer.

The bill now goes to the Senate. Donating 'distressed' foods Food handlers could donate \"distressed\" foods to local governments or to the state,under a bill passed by the House March 18.The vote was 130-0. Food is considered distressed when it can- not legally be sold but is still deemed safe \u2014unspoiled milk that has not sold before theexpiration date, for example. Currently, food handlers can donate dis- tressed foods to nonprofit organizations whosupply the food to the elderly or needy. Thebill ( HF176/SF154* ) would expand the law to allow them to donate these foods to units ofgovernment. The bill would remove liability for food handlers who choose to donate the distressedfood, except in instances of gross negligenceor intentional misconduct. Bill sponsor Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) said that the idea was brought toher by county commissioners who felt that itwas a good way to defray corrections costs. \"It's food that may not be marketable, but it is still safe for consumption,\" Harder said. The bill now goes to the Senate.10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998 HEALTH HOUSING Lanette Howze, of Minneapolis, holds her sign to shade her eyes from the sun during a March19 rally on the steps of the Capitol. The rally,sponsored by the Welfare Rights Committee,attracted people who want changes in welfarereform law that was enacted last year.Welfare rallyAcquiring nonprofit hospitals The House passed a bill March 17 that would make it more difficult for for-profit hospitalgroups or health care companies to acquirenonprofit hospitals. The vote was 76-53. The attorney general already has the power to investigate and stop such transactions, butthe bill would ensure written notice would goto the attorney general's office 45 days inadvance of the deal. The attorney general could make the trans- action notices accessible to the public andobtain public comment on any pendingtransaction. The bill stipulates that the attorney general could investigate transactions if 50 percent ormore of a hospital's assets are involved in theproposed sale and could make notice to thepublic if the attorney general determines thepublic would benefit from the information. Nonprofit hospitals are commonly viewed as charitable community assets, but from 1990to 1996 a total of 192 nonprofit hospitalsnationwide were converted to for-profit sta-tus. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), the bill's sponsor, said that before California adoptedsimilar legislation, roughly $3 billion in publicassets disappeared when for-profit chains ac-quired nonprofit hospitals. Public funds are used for various projects at nonprofit hospitals. If the hospital is acquiredby a for-profit company, the company ac-quires assets paid for with public dollars, pos-sibly at less than fair-market value. Acquiring a hospital below market value would likely mean fewer dollars enter chari-table trusts to help those communities pro-mote health care. HF381/SF695* awaits action in a confer- ence committee. Emergency medical care People who provide emergency medical care with a new device called an automatic externaldefibrillator would not be liable for civil dam-ages, under a bill the House passed March 17.The vote was 125-0. The exemption for liability would fall under the existing \"Good Samaritan statute,\" whichprovides immunity to untrained people whogive emergency care, unless the patientobjects. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Geri Evans (DFL-New Brighton), would not exemptmedical professionals but would include vol-unteer firefighters, volunteer police officers, and other volunteers likely to find themselvesin a situation where administering the treat-ment is necessary. Many airlines are now carrying the new defibrillator devices, which restore the rhythmof the heart by delivering an electric shock.Other businesses also are beginning to investin the devices. To use an automatic external defibrillator, the rescuer places two pads on the victim'schest area, and the device measures the heart'srhythm. If the device detects ventricular fibril-lation, which requires a shock to the heart, themachine directs the user to push a button. According to the American Heart Associa- tion, more than 250,000 Americans die eachyear from sudden cardiac arrest, and fewerthan seven percent of those suffering cardiac arrest outside a hospital survive. The association believes wider availability of these defibrillators would reduce fatalities. HF3138/SF2861* now goes to the governor for his consideration. Preserving low-income housing The law governing how private-activity, tax- exempt bonds can be allocated would be al-tered under a bill passed by the House March16. The vote was 128-0. These bonds are used to finance private projects, and because of their tax-exempt sta-tus, the state places limits on how they areallocated. HF3165 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would give top priority toprojects that preserve existing federally subsi-dized low-income housing. Rest's bill, along with several others intro- duced this year, seeks to address a shortage ofaffordable housing that may develop becauseof a situation involving federally subsidizedcomplexes. In the 1970s, the federal government set up a program where developers received reduced-rate mortgages and financing incentives tobuild low- and moderate-income housing.Rent rates were subsidized by the federal gov-ernment and rent increases were regulated. Owners of these complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allows them toprepay the remaining portion of their mort-gage and to begin charging market rate rent. Housing advocates say that this situation could happen at over 300 apartment com-plexes throughout the state that were financedthrough the federal program. HF3165 would make several changes in the law that regulates distribution of the state'sfederal limit for private-activity, tax-exemptbonds. In addition to highlighting low-income housing preservation, the bill would give spe-cial consideration to projects for seniors only. The bill now goes to the Senate. Housing options for seniors A new law signed by the governorMarch 18 seeks to create more af-fordable housing options forseniors. Effective March 19, 1998, the law will expand the statutory defini- tion of elderly housing as it applies to theSigned by the governor11 March 20, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYhuman rights law, bringing state law into com- pliance with federal statutes. The effect will bethat more facilities could classify as elderlyhousing exclusively. The new law will remove the requirement that elderly housing must provide facilitiesdesigned to meet social and physical needs,such as recreation and meeting rooms. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley), sponsor of the measure, said that the addi-tional services provided to tenants mean addi-tional cost in rent. \"These types of facilities often cause rent to be $100 to $300 higher than other facilities,\"he said. Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF2779/SF2230*/CH291 Selling abandoned homes A new state law aims to helpMinnesota's manufactured-homepark owners rid their properties ofabandoned homes. Effective March 17, 1998, the law authorizes the owner of a manu- factured-home park to obtain a limited dealer'slicense and to sell up to five used homes thatare within the park's boundaries per year. Previously, only real estate agents and li- censed dealers were permitted to sell manu-factured homes in Minnesota. The legislation was introduced at the re- quest of rural park owners who were havingdifficulties attracting agents to sell low-endhomes. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) and Sen. StevenNovak (DFL-New Brighton). HF3148/SF2047*/CH280Signed by the governor HUMAN SERVICESINDUSTRY Removing employment barriers A resolution asking the U.S. Congress to remove Medicaid policy barriers to employ-ment for people with disabilities has been filedwith the Office of the Secretary of State with-out the governor's signature. The resolution urges Congress to adopt Medicaid buy-in legislation that would allowpeople with permanent disabilities to retainMedicaid coverage to address unmet healthneeds when they become employed. Employee-based health care and govern- ment programs such as Medicare andMinnesotaCare do not typically cover long-term support needed by disabled people.The resolution seeks to remove any policy barriers to employment so more people withdisabilities can reduce their dependence ongovernment programs and become taxpayingworkers.

HF3258/SF2699*/Res. 7 A practice called 'slamming' Long-distance telephone carriers would need to provide proof that a customer autho-rized a change in long-distance service carri-ers, under a bill the House passed March 18.The vote was 132-0. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), aims to further com-bat a practice called \"slamming,\" which is theswitching of long-distance carriers without acustomer's permission. Telephone customers sometimes receive mailed notices that their long-distance carrierwill be switched unless the customer respondsto the letter and cancels the change. The legislation stipulates that if challenged, a long-distance carrier would have to provideproof the change was actively authorized by acustomer. This would require a carrier to pro-duce a tape recording or written statement ofthe approval. If the long-distance provider could not present the evidence, that carrier would haveto pay the cost of returning the customer tothe original service and the cost of thecustomer's long distance calls during the un-authorized period. Long-distance telephone carriers also would have to provide, upon customer request, in-formation about the cost of interstate andintrastate calls, including any difference inpricing for evening, night, and weekend rates.The carrier also would have to provide otherapplicable information such as flat fees andtermination charges. The measure would deem it insufficient if the long-distance carrier simply files tariffs orprice lists for its services with a regulatoryagency. The legislation also would repeal a current provision that allows carriers to notify cus-tomers of price increases through newspaperads. Instead, carriers would have to make adirect notice to customers, either by includingthe information with a bill or by direct mail. Another provision would require carriers to offer customers the ability to block interna-tional calls from their telephones. This would prevent children or other unauthorized call-ers from making international calls. HF3042 now moves to the Senate. Using professional titles Industrial hygienists \u2014 people hired to make work environmentssafer \u2014 will become members of alegally recognized profession un-der a new law effective Aug. 1, 1998. The law will prohibit people who do not meet certain requirements from usingspecific titles including industrial hygienist,certified safety professional, and constructionhealth and safety technologist. Only those who have attended an accred- ited college or university and received theproper certification will be allowed to usethose professional titles. For instance, a certi-fied industrial hygienist will have to pass a testby the nonprofit American Board of Indus-trial Hygiene and maintain that license inorder to use the title. The restrictions will not apply to properly supervised apprentices, or to employees of thestate of Minnesota, who are already subject tostrict standards. Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington), who sponsored the proposal in the House, said thelaw will not only protect the professionals, butwill further public health and safety by ensur-ing quality work. Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) spon- sored the new measure in the Senate. HF668*/SF668/CH288Signed by the governor MCHA cap increased The maximum lifetime benefit forpeople who get their health cover-age through Minnesota Compre-hensive Health Association(MCHA) will be increased from$1.5 million to $2 million, under a new law effective March 19, 1998. The change is necessary to address the needs of a southern Minnesota boy who suffers fromMelnick-Needles Syndrome, a bone and carti-lage disorder. The boy requires a full-timenurse, specialized equipment, frequent hospi-tal visits, and medications. A 1995 law moved the cap on MCHA ben- efits from $1 million to $1.5 million becausethe boy's medical expenses were approachingthe limit and he was at risk of being cut offfrom coverage.Signed by the governorINSURANCE12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998Now, the child is closing in on the $1.5 million maximum. Also, supporters of thenew law said $2 million is the standard limitfor lifetime benefits. The Legislature created MCHA in 1976 to sell insurance to state residents who have beenturned down for insurance due to pre-existingconditions. The organization is not funded by the state. Premiums are collected from participants andfrom an annual assessment on insurance com-panies, health maintenance organizations, andother insurance providers. The boy could have been forced onto the government-funded Medical Assistance pro-gram, had the MCHA coverage limit not beenincreased. The new measure was sponsored by Rep. John Dorn (DFL-Mankato) andSen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan). HF3065/SF2608*/CH293 LAWVetoed by the governor Snow rests on a statue of the young Civil Warsoldier Knute Nelson. The monument ofNelson, who served as governor of Minnesotain the 1890s, stands in front of the Capitol andis one of a group of works depicting differentstages in the governor's life.Snow cappedNo break on insurance premiums Gov. Arne Carlson used his vetoauthority March 18 to strike downlegislation that would have al-lowed drivers who successfullycomplete an accident prevention course to get a break on auto insurancepremiums. Drivers over 30 years old who passed the safety course would have received a 10 percentreduction in their auto insurance premiums,under the bill. Currently, drivers 55 and olderwho pass an accident prevention course everythree years receive a premium reduction. In his veto message, Carlson wrote, \"Statis- tical analyses fail to provide evidence thatsuccessful completion of additional driver test-ing results in heightened safety rates on Min-nesota roadways.\" He said automobile insurance premiums ought to be determined by the market andindividual driving records. \"Any mandated rate reduction to one class of citizen drivers would unfairly shift costs tothose of the unprotected class,\" he said. \"Inthis case, the shift would take place on thosedrivers who are already paying the highestpremiums within this state, that is, those driv-ers under the age of 30.\" Carlson also said while a driver safety course can be effective for those 55 and older, \"I donot believe that the completion of this type ofprogram would be effective on youngerdrivers.\" The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington) andSen. Douglas Johnson (DFL-Tower). HF2846*/SF2245/CH287New investment options The House passed a bill March 13 that would give insurance companies more flexibility ininvesting their assets. The vote was 128-4. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), \"financially strong\" insurerscould choose to be governed by the new provi-sions in the bill, rather than by current stateinsurance laws, which would stay in place. To use the new investment options, insur- ers would be required to have a minimum of$2 billion in total assets and a total of capitaland surplus of $200 million. Insurers who qualify and decide to invest under the bill could invest in anything withina standard considered by the company's boardof directors, subject to an internal controlsystem. The companies would have to have awritten investment policy. Under the bill, the commissioner of com- merce could require information from insur-ers, and the commissioner could hire an expertto review an insurer's investments. The com-missioner could order insurers to change theirinvestments, and the insurers could request hearings. HF3355 /SF3032* goes to the governor. Reinsurance investment options Reinsurance intermediary-brokers would have more investment options for the fundsthey hold for insurance companies, under abill passed by the House March 16. The votewas 129-1. Currently, reinsurance intermediary-bro- kers may invest funds they hold for insurancecompanies exclusively in bank trust accounts.The bill would allow investments in federallyguaranteed short-term securities or anyinvestment considered appropriate. The bill states that the investments must be traded on a national securities exchange andmay include municipal and corporate bonds. The reinsurance broker, who could take advantage of the new investment opportuni-ties only with written permission from theclient who holds the money, would be respon-sible for any losses on the investments. According to the bill, the investments \"should emphasize safety, liquidity, and di-versification.\" The bill, sponsored byRep.

Special guardians, conservators A new law signed by the governorMarch 16 refines the special guard-ian and conservator hearing pro-cess to prevent potential abuse. Guardians and conservators are appointed by the state courts to make decisions for adults who are incapable ofmaking decisions for themselves, oftentimesthe elderly in nursing homes. Special guardianships and conservatorships differ in that they are temporary arrange-ments designed to respond to short-termsituations. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law length- ens the time required to give notice of hear-ings related to special guardianships andconservatorships from 24 hours to 48 hoursand requires that the hearing be held withintwo weeks of the notice. The law also requires that petitioners show a clear need for the appointment. It also limitsthese appointments to 30 days. Rep.

Arne Carlson signed into lawMarch 16 a measure that allowscities of the first class to place artand informational signs on bicycleracks and storage areas. Effective March 17, 1998, the new law results from a desire by the MinneapolisCity Council to place decorated bicycle rackson every block in the Uptown neighborhoodof the city. The city is trying to promote bicycle riding to ease parking and traffic congestion. Cityofficials want to place art or signs on the racksthat would blend with the Uptown area's at-mosphere that caters to a young clientele. The art and signs will be allowed only if placement does not create a hazard. That de-cision will be left to the road authority thatauthorizes the placement of the art or signage.

HF2589 , sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), would require any motorist whobecomes stranded after bypassing a barricadedesigned to prevent travel on a highway dur-ing or after a storm to pay up to $10,000 inexpenses incurred during any rescue efforts bylocal or state law enforcement officials. The House Ways and Means Committee approved the bill March 16. The legislation resulted from a number of incidents during the 1996-1997 winter whendrivers ignored highway barricades. Law en-forcement officers put themselves at risk tosave some of the motorists, and the state orlocal law enforcement units paid the cost. The legislation would allow the state agencyor political entity that incurs the cost to bring action to recover up to $10,000 of those costs.Legislators were told the cost of the rescues istypically under $2,000. Drivers would be liable if they failed to obey the instruction of authorized personnel at therestricted roadway, or if they drove over,around, or through a barricade designed tostop travel on a closed portion of highway. Also in the bill is a provision crafted to prevent motorists from driving around low-ered railway crossing gates. Under current law, drivers who go around lowered railway gates face a misdemeanorcharge only if it is determined that it wasunsafe to do so. The bill would require alldrivers to stop when railway gates are loweredand to wait for the gates to be raised. Anyonewho drives around the gates \u2014 regardless ofthe conditions \u2014 would face a misdemeanorcharge. Legislators asked if the restriction applies tomalfunctioning gates that are triggered when no train is approaching, or gates that fail torise after a train passes. Betsy Parker, of the Department of Trans- portation, told legislators those instances arerare, while violations occur frequently whentrains are oncoming and the gates have workedproperly. No provision was included in thebill to address the issue of gate malfunctions. Aircraft repair resolution A resolution asking President Clinton and Congress to enact federal legislation called theAircraft Repair Station Safety Act of 1997 hasbeen filed with the Office of the Secretary ofState without the governor's signature. The resolution supports a congressional ef- fort to force foreign repair facilities to use thesame standards that apply to domestic aircraftrepair procedures and parts. Some aviation experts are concerned that airplane repair facilities in foreign countriesuse defective parts or do substandard repairwork on U.S. airplanes. Federal legislation before the U.S. Congress aims to tighten controls on repair facilitiesthat service aircraft that operate in the U.S.The act would revoke certification of any re-pair facility that purposely uses uncertified orsubstandard parts.

Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law requires the commissioner of transportation to adopt adesign and to erect the signs to mark thememorial highway. The signs will be paid forby the community of Cambridge, Minn. Last year, Bowe became the first Minnesota State Patrol officer killed in the line of duty since1978.

HF2612*/SF2335/CH290 Signed by the governor14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998By Jim Thielman A cavalry broadsword was large, heavy, and a poor choice for duels, which is whyAbraham Lincoln chose it. \"I don't want the fellow to kill me,\" he said.The fellow was James Shields, one of four Civil War officers whose statue stands on thesecond floor of the Minnesota State Capitol. Shields' bronze likeness in the Capitol is one of many artistic elements carrying a CivilWar theme. The reason for that theme is nomystery. Minnesotans were still living on the edge of the frontier when ground was broken for thethird and current state Capitol in 1896, andthe young men who survived the Civil Warhad become state decision-makers. Three of the six men who served on the commission to build the Minnesota Capitolwere Civil War veterans. Six of the state's first10 governors were Civil War veterans. So it's evident why six of eight paintings that hang in the Governor's Reception Room \u2014the most ornate and elaborately appointedroom in the Capitol \u2014 depict Civil War battles. In alcoves on the second floor of the Capitol \u2014 where the rotunda turns into an octagonalwall of Kasota stone \u2014 stand the larger-than-life statues of Civil War heroes John B. Sanborn,Alexander Wilkin, William Colvill, andShields. All four were prominent figures in19th century Minnesota. Maj. Gen. James Shields Shields was perhaps the best-known of the group. He was regarded as a handsome bach-elor \u2014 genial yet vain \u2014 and a statesman. Andhe considered himself a ladies' man. When the Democrat Shields served as Illi-Memorials in bronze . . . Four Civil War officers stand tall in Capitol rotunda nois state auditor, he clashed rhetorically withLincoln, who was then a Whig. After Shields learned Lincoln had written, under a pseudonym, a letter to a newspapersatirizing an Illinois currency crisis and Shields'aversion to marriage, Shields challenged Lin-coln to a duel. In Lincoln's day, it was the job of \"seconds\" to resolve disputes. Most of these challenges tohonor were settled diplomatically, andLincoln's second did just that. Even if the duelhad occurred, it's likely Lincoln would havewon and both men would have survived. Lincoln had the choice of weapons and condi- tions, and Lincoln's favored conditions wouldhave restricted the movement of each man, keep-ing Lincoln's body well beyond the reach ofShields. Shields was shorter than Lincoln, whohad uncommonly long arms and who admittedhe had practiced with the broadsword. \"I felt sure that I could disarm him,\" Lin- coln said, \"having had more than a month tolearn the broadsword exercise.\" Lincoln was said to be greatly embarrassed by the dispute, but both political careerssteamed forward. While Lincoln's fate is wellknown today, Shields' is not. Shields \u2014 a major general during the war \u2014 became the only man to serve as a senatorin three states \u2014 Illinois, Minnesota, andMissouri. He also was the governor of theOregon Territory. Gen. Alexander Wilkin Of the four Civil War veterans cast in bronze at the Capitol, only Gen. Alexander Wilkindied in battle. He was the highest rankingMinnesota officer to perish in the Civil War. Wilkin founded St. Paul Fire and MarineInsurance Company before the war. He stood 5-foot-1 and weighed about 110 pounds, butthe descendent of two generations of politi-cians was considered a tenacious fighter, and,like Shields, was not averse to a duel. Wilkinshot and killed a fellow officer who challengedhim during the Mexican War. Wilkin faced many war-time skirmishes and once expressed amazement at surviving a battlein which he was caught in a Confederatecrossfire and could sense the bullets whizzingpast his skull. He died while he was supposed to be in reserve in Tupelo, Miss. Hot-tempered Con-federate officer Nathan Bedford Forrest, whohad no formal military training, was raidingheavily in middle Tennessee at the time. Wilkinwas among those Gen. William Shermanthought could stop Forrest. That's somethingwhich might have changed history: Forrestsurvived to found the Ku Klux Klan. Union casualties near Tupelo were slight in the ensuing battle, but Wilkin was amongthem. In 1868, Minnesota's Wilkin Countywas named after him. Col. William Colvill The statue of Col. William Colvill appropri- ately overlooks a tattered cloth encased inglass on the Capitol's first floor. The cloth isthe remnant of a flag the First MinnesotaRegiment carried at Gettysburg, the bloodiestbattle ever fought on American soil.

He was, someonesaid, \"purposely impressive in mannerand rather pompous at times.\" As architect of the Minnesota Capitol, he was driven to control its every detail,including the monuments that wouldstand inside. While Capitol visitors might not think critically of the four immense bronze CivilWar statues that stand on the secondfloor of the building, Gilbert was notpleased with any of them. He was leastsatisfied with the work of Minneapolisartist Catherine Backus, who renderedthe memorial to William Colvill. Gilbert wanted a sculptor of interna- tional repute to do Colvill's statue. Whenthe citizens' group commissionedBackus ignored that wish, he wrote to thegroup: \"You now have before you models for this important work by persons who arenaturally ambitious but who, so far as Ican ascertain, utterly lack the trainingand experience to execute the work.\" Despite Gilbert's evaluation, the work by Backus was placed in the Capitol, andmany other memorials without Gilbert'sblessing followed.Civil War statues lack Cass Gilbert's blessingIn 1905, Colvill was the first man to lie in state in the present Capitol. He is buried inCannon Falls, Minn. Brevet Maj. John B. Sanborn The fourth statue on the Capitol's second floor is of Brevet Maj. John B. Sanborn, whowas Minnesota's adjutant general when theCivil War began. Commander of the Fourth Minnesota vol- unteer infantry, he was one of two brigadecommanders in charge of Vicksburg afterGen. Ulysses S. Grant took the city. Sanborn was a lawyer and both a state sena- tor and representative.

Edwina Garcia (DFL-Richfield) shows upon your doorstep in the next fewmonths. Garcia has decided to leave the House after four terms to run for the office ofsecretary of state. And she loves door-to-doorcampaigning. \"I would probably door-knock even out of office \u2014 just to talk,\" she said during a recentinterview. \"Sometimes I knock so hard, theskin on my knuckles starts peeling. Peopleinvite you in and ask for help with things \u2014 Ihave even helped people unclog sinks.\" Garcia believes it is of utmost importance for elected officials to go out into the commu-nities they represent and visit the nursinghomes, hospitals, veterans homes, and eventhe casinos. \"If you really want to know what's in people's hearts or how they've overcome adversity, goout there and talk to them and listen to them,\"she said. \"If you don't, how can you be thejudge of how some people live or don't live?\" Garcia grew up poor in Clovis, N.M., which is about one hundred miles west of Amarillo,Texas. Her parents divorced after her alcoholic father gambled away the ranch that was theirfamily home. Her dad often would fail tofollow through on his word, she said, andfrom this she learned the importance of disci-pline and persistence. \"He had great visions and promises, but he never fulfilled anything,\" she said. \"It's likethe old saying goes, even a bad example is agood example.\" As a means of \"escape\" during her child- hood, Garcia would slip off to 10-cent JuneAllison movies and to the library. \"I loved to read, but my grandmother used to say, 'Put that book down. All you're goingto wind up doing is changing diapers, any-way,'\" Garcia said. \"If my background hadbeen different, I don't think I would whereI am today.\"Rep. Edwina Garcia . . . Four-term legislator gears up for more door-knocking Garcia and her husband, Joe, left New Mexico for Minnesota in the early 1970s. \"We only came with one pickup, my daugh- ter, and a little dog,\" she said. \"We just tookoff, the four of us, because we wanted to startfresh. But I tell you, if we hadn't come here, Idon't think we would have had the opportuni-ties or direction to follow.\" At the age of 35, Garcia was the first person in her family or her husband's family to gradu-ate from college. Their daughter, Jill, becamethe first in the family to obtain a master'sdegree. Garcia was in the middle of her second term on the Richfield City Council when shemounted a successful run for the House in1990. The legislative district she represents is \"landlocked\" between the Minneapolis-St.Paul airport, several major freeways, and Edina,Garcia said. Before seeking the state office, shewas frustrated by the lack of partnership be-tween her local government and theLegislature.\"We have nowhere to grow but up,\" she said. \"We've done very well in terms of rede-velopment and building up our tax base.\" Garcia regards the Metropolitan Airport Commission noise mitigation legislation shesponsored as her \"sweetest victory\" because itwas a win for the people who live adjacent tothe airport. \"It was just beautiful because [the commis- sion] hadn't been defeated in years,\" she said.\"I like to fight impossible battles and I like achallenge. It just keeps you going and givesyou so much energy.\" Garcia said she can feel her energy level increasing as she gears up for her secretary ofstate campaign. \"I've never lost a race, but if someone were to beat me, I would say, 'I wish you well. I wishyou success. If there's anything I can do to helpyou in that office, I will,' and I would walkaway free,\" she said. \"Whatever happens, I'mOK with leaving.\" Rep. Edwina Garcia is leaving the House after four terms to seek the position of secretary of state.

But Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka) said in a recent interview that his children are one ofthe main reasons he is running for state attor-ney general. \"One of the reasons I'm leaving the House is that this is critical time in their lives,\" Weaversaid. \"The attorney general's office will allowme to be there.\" Weaver said that unlike the governor and legislators who have to deal with the constantpolitical battle, the attorney general's work ismuch less partisan. \"It's not an easier job,\" Weaver said. \"I'll just have more control over my own destiny.I'm really looking forward to spending moretime with my kids.\" Weaver said that his experiences as a pros- ecuting attorney for Anoka County make hispursuit a logical one. He has worked for thecounty since 1991. Weaver also has a good deal of experience when it comes to political battles. Elected in1988, he rose rapidly to a leadership role withinthe Republican caucus. He is currently anassistant minority leader and Republican floorleader, and he frequently takes the point posi-tion for the Republicans in floor debate. Weaver joked that his inspiration to run for a seat in the Legislature stems from a \"geneticdefect.\" Weaver's family has had a long history in state politics. Weaver's House seat was held byhis father, Charles Weaver, from 1967 to 1974and by his uncle John Weaver from 1979 to1982. \"Growing up, it wasn't my ambition to be a state representative,\" Weaver said. \"I didn'tgrow up with that as my goal. It just workedout that way.\" Whether it was nature or nurture, Weaver eventually got involved in politics. He saidlooking back now it's obvious to him that hisfather was the inspiration to go into publiclife. \"My father was my hero,\" Weaver said. \"And I learned the importance of giving backto the community from him.\"Rep. Charlie Weaver . . . Five-term lawmaker seeks control over his own destiny Weaver said that he is very proud of his work in the Legislature regarding school safety.He was the chief author of the 1993 Safe SchoolsAct, which sought to give teachers and admin-istrators the power to keep the state's schoolssafe from violence. He also is pleased with his lesser-known legislative work. \"I am very proud of the little things,\" Weaver said. \"The genetic discrimination act that wepassed two years ago and the bone marrowdonor legislation, for example. These thingshave been really important to me.\" Weaver said that he learned a good deal about strategy from House members on bothsides of the aisle. He said that his role modelswere former Reps. Brad Stanius, Paul Ogren,and Gil Gutknecht. \"The thing that all three of these guys had in common was they could be tough, strongpartisans without being personal,\" he said.\"They could disagree without beingdisagreeable.\" Weaver said that the members of the Legislature can learn from that attitude. Hesaid that he is worried that members are losingthe ability to both debate ideas and maintainfriendships. \"The thing that legislators need to avoid, and it's getting harder and harder to do it, istaking themselves too seriously,\" Weaver said. \"We tend to come down here and get caughtup in the business, and that's important. Butmy biggest disappointment in the last 10 yearsis the decline in the personal relationshipsbetween members.\" Weaver said that such relationships are im- portant to the institution. \"When I first arrived here there were lots of opportunities to talk to other members andget to know them in social settings,\" he said.\"Frankly, that's declined and I think it's badfor the system that we don't spend much timetogether \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014outside of here.\" He also thinks that partisanship has become a serious problem for the Legislature, espe-cially for the image of the institution. \"It's not good especially now that we're on camera,\" Weaver said \"The worst thing wecould do is cause people to lose respect for theinstitution. We don't lose respect by disagree-ing on issues. We lose it by being overtlypartisan.\" Weaver said that he will miss members from both sides of the aisle, but he is excited abouthis future plans. \"It's going to be fun,\" he said. \"If I don't win, I'll just go back to prosecuting bad guys.\"Rep. Charlie Weaver, a second-generation House member, will not seek re-election this fall. He is acandidate for attorney general.18 SESSION WEEKLY / March 20, 1998If you've lost track of some of the bills you have been following during the ses-sion, you may find them on one of thesepages.

The article said that 1972, 1982, and1992 attempts at redistricting in Minnesotahad to be settled by the federal courts becausematters had not been resolved by the electiondeadline. The 1992 redistricting plan waspassed by the Legislature and became lawafter a failed attempt by Gov. Arne Carlson toveto the proposal. The administration thenmounted a court challenge that went all theway to the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowedthe Legislature's redistricting plan to stand.Because courtesy titles such as \"madam chair\" or \"representative\" precede a person'sname when addressed in House proceedings,it's not rare for confusion to occur. Often,someone addresses a person by the wrongtitle. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) had trouble with Minnesota State Colleges and Universi-ties Vice Chancellor of Finance Laura Kingduring testimony at the March 16 House Waysand Means Committee meeting. \"I guess I could just call you 'Laura,'\" Bishop finally conceded. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) quickly re- sponded that would be allowed only if Bishopaddressed the men by their first name. Bishopsaid that he had never been accused of beingsexist, \"at least not since my fourth daughterwas born.\"Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), the com- mittee chair, got a laugh and ended the ex-change when he turned to Bishop and in afatherly voice said, \"David, if you'll continue.\" When someone asked House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) before aMarch 16 committee meeting how he enjoyedthe weekend, it was impossible for Sviggumnot to smile. Sviggum's son, Hans, a 5-foot-8 guard for Kenyon-Wanamingo, played the pivotal rolein putting his team in the high school statebasketball tournament. Hans stole a pass with 19 seconds left in a March 13 game that led to the state tourna-ment berth. He was fouled twice after thatsteal, sank all four free throw attempts, andKenyon-Wanamingo won 34-32. There was more reason for Sviggum to beam over his son March 17. Hans scored 18 points,including nine of 10 free throws in the final quarter, in a 55-47 state quarterfinal win overtop-ranked, unbeaten Redwood Valley.20 WEEKLYTracking the Bills . . . March 13 - 19, 1998 CH274-CH304 HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFOnce a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sentto the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when consid-ering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within anappropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differenteffects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsBills await governor's action and files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required. But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sinedie\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a datecertain\"). If the governor does not sign a billwithin this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto.\" Thegovernor is not required to provide a reasonfor the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he or sheobjects. As with all vetoes (save pocket ve-toes) the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the veto with the re-turned bill. Here, too, the timetable is either14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, orwithin three days after the governor receivesthe bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

As early as 1860, Jane Grey Swisshelm, editor of the St. Cloud Visitor, was invited to speak before the Minnesota House on \"Women and Politics.\" The first of her gender to address the body,she was praised by one newspaper as awoman \"who mingled in politics withoutlosing her feminine attributes.\" It was seven years later when Sarah Burger Stearns and Mary Colburn broughtthe first petition for women's suffrage tothe Legislature. Although they received ahearing before a special committee, noaction was taken that year. But the following year, another peti- tion was introduced and approved by theHouse Elections Committee. On theHouse floor, however, the issue wasgreeted with laughter and shelved. In 1870, a bill that would put the ques- tion to Minnesota voters actually passed both the House and theSenate. Lawmakers even added a provision that would have al-lowed women as well as men to vote on the required constitutionalamendment. And while that move may have seemed like good news to theRoad to women's suffrage proves rocky suffragists, in fact, lawmakers had only added that provision withthe expectation that women themselves would defeat the initiativeat the polls. In any event, the matter was settled by Gov. Horace Austin, who vetoed the bill. The first real success for Minnesota suffragists came in 1875, when voters approved an amendment allowing women to vote onschool questions and to hold school offices. Proponents used two tricky moves to secure the success of that ballot. First, they minimized attentionon the issue until just before election day,when they persuaded the St. Paul Pioneer Press to endorse the amendment. Also, they convinced both political parties toprint the ballots only in the affirmative,so voters would have to find a pencil,cross out yes, and write no to vote againstit. Although advocates continued to or- ganize and to lobby, it was another twodecades before the suffrage movementgained further concessions in Minnesota.In 1898, libraries were added to the shortlist of organizations for which women could vote and run for office. Little changed for another 20 years, until the Legislature passed a resolution urging Congress to pass the 19th Amendment.Minnesota ratified that amendment the same year, and womenwere voting in 1920. Women register to vote in 1924 at the Calvin Coolidgecampaign headquarters in Minneapolis.

Ward will retire at the end of this the 80th Legislative Session. For those who don't know \"Charlie,\" he is the personwho watches the door and keeps uninvited guests out of theHouse chamber. He has performed his duties for the past 11years, and worked for the House since 1982. Once you get toknow Charlie, you won't forget him. Charlie will be missed as a fixture in the chamber. Those who know him and know his stories will remember his dry wit. His classic one-liners will not beforgotten either. Charlie says, \"I've got a good memory, but it's short.\" When legislators are not in the chamber, Charlie is sometimes the brunt of a harmless practical joke such as a far-fetched phone call prank. \"Anything that comes from the Front Desk, I gotta believe,\" he says. \"The people who have really been good to me are the Chief Clerk and his entire staff.\" If you ask him about himself, Charlie will tell you that he is \"79 years old and proud of it.\" He adds that \"God has blessed me with a wonderful wife of 49 years. She is my life. Andmy six children and 11 grandchildren are great, too.\" In typical Charlie fashion, he says,\"Life has been good!\" As the House doorkeeper, Charlie stands outside the chamber to check out anyone he thinks does not have the credentials to enter. Over the years, Charlie has questionedgovernor's staff, new journalists, senators, former legislators, and new members aboutentering the chamber if he didn't know them. \"But I do have great respect for therepresentatives on both sides of the aisle,\" he says. Before session, Charlie stands outside the 15-foot high sliding double doors that serve as the chamber's main entrance. Honoring House protocol, he opens a door only for membersand special guests. Inside the chamber, Henry Erdman, assistant sergeant-at-arms, onlyopens the other door for those leaving. Charlie will tell you that \"the lobbyists know better.They don't even test me by climbing that first step up to the entrance.\" Charlie sits at the chief sergeant's desk inside the open chamber door when the House is not in session. On occasion, he will give a brief talk to tourists and constituents about thechamber. Otherwise, protocol dictates that a sergeant be present in the chamber at all times. A large clock hangs high above and behind the desk. The timepiece was returned to its place of honor during the 1990 restoration of the chamber. This same clock years ago wouldbe covered at midnight on the last night of a two-year legislative session so that legislativebusiness could continue. Too bad the tradition cannot be resurrected for Charlie. Something will be missing from the House chamber on the first day of the 81st Legislative Session \u2014 Charles. F. Ward's presence. But, Charlie says, \"My time here has been wonderful, and that's damn good.\" \u2014 LeClair Grier Lambert Charles F. Ward3 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Grant Martin Members of a House-Senate conference committee on this year's bonding bill are strug-gling to find middle ground following an in-tense review of the St. Paul RiverCentre hockeyarena proposal March 26. The proposed state contribution of $65 million has become one of the major points ofcontention between the two sides in confer-ence committee. The House bill would fundthe project; the Senate bill would not. Legislators got an opportunity to question representatives of the Minnesota Wild hockeyteam and St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman re-garding the highly publicized and sometimescontroversial plan to bring NHL hockey backto Minnesota. The hearing followed the recent revelation that the construction firm awarded a contractfor the project had contributed to the Minne-sota Wild's NHL application fee. The Minne-sota Wild has since returned the fee to theconstruction company. Sen. Gary Laidig (R-Stillwater), addressing Mayor Coleman, said that these transactionsdemonstrate the need for further oversight ofthe project. \"I am disturbed by this and apparently you are not,\" Laidig said. Coleman defended the Minnesota Wild and the construction company brought into ques-tion. He said that the construction firm was oneof many private companies that contributedmoney to help bring hockey back to Minnesota. \"It is absurd,\" Coleman said. \"It is absurd to insinuate that a premier construction com-pany with experience in building sports facili-ties [and] with experience building conventioncenters did anything improper.\" However, committee members appeared to be more interested in the details of the arenaplan and the possibility of finding middleground between the House and Senate ver-sions of the bonding bill. The $130 million arena proposal is, in fact, a done deal. The city has already negotiated alease agreement with the Minnesota Wild andthe NHL, and has a plan in place to fund theconstruction. The arena will be built with orwithout state support. The question that remains is will the state support the plan and if so, how much supportit provide. Of the $130 million, the city of St. Paul willMinnesota Wild . . . Lawmakers, city officials face off on arena proposal bond for $30 million, and the team will pro-vide $35 million in the form of a letter ofcredit. The team also will pay the NHL $80million for the franchise. These amounts arecurrently set by the lease. The city of St. Paul will pay off its $30 million bond contribution through a $1 ticketsurcharge and through revenues raised froman outdoor marquee. The city is requesting that the state provide $65 million in general obligation bonds. If thestate does not provide these funds, the city isresponsible for covering the remaining amountunder contracts already negotiated. Coleman told the committee that the arena is just a part of a larger plan to revitalize theentire RiverCentre facility and downtown St.Paul. He said that the expansion of the entirefacility will mean new jobs and economic de-velopment in the area. \"Right now, we have a private company willing to come in and pay $80 million to helpour capital city,\" he said. He said the plan should be given the same treatment that other convention centersreceive. \"All we seek is fairness,\" Coleman said. \"We should be treated the same way as other facili-ties that are asking for a partnership with thestate.\"Coleman said that the plan is good for the state and good for taxpayers. \"The question we have consistently asked ourselves is, 'Are the public and the taxpayersadequately protected?'\" Coleman said. \"Theanswer is a resounding 'yes.'\" Coleman specifically cited provisions in the arena lease that guarantee that the team mustremain in the facility at least for 10 years, andafter that if the team chooses to leave, the teamis responsible for the remaining bonding debt. Coleman labeled this provision \"an unprec- edented taxpayer protection that the city in-sisted be part of the lease.\" Sen. Jerry Janezich (DFL-Chisholm) said that this is not simply a convention centerproposal. \"You may want to compare this to other projects,\" Janezich said. \"It's a hockey arenafor the team. To think it's for anything but theteam is crazy.\" Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) said that the RiverCentre arena should be viewed apartfrom other convention center proposals sim-ply because it deals with public subsidies forsports. \"The Minneapolis facility is a facility that has no money going to a sports team,\" BerglinSt. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, left, and Pam Wheelock, the city's director of planning and economic development, describe their finance plan for a new arena to host the Minnesota Wild hockey team. Theyappeared before the House-Senate bonding conference committee March 25. Continued on page 44 SESSION WEEKLY / March 27, 1998By Grant Martin It is only fitting that an interview with former Rep. Chuck Dimler would be con-ducted via cellular phone with the subjecttraveling in his car down some unknownMinnesota highway. Dimler \u2014 the man who has saved many Minnesotans from auto insurance rate hikes\u2014 would have no need to invoke the statu-tory provision bearing his name. He wasobeying the speed limit. \"Right now, I'm going 55 miles per hour,\" he said. \"You see, the traffic warrants itright here. The car in front of me is going55.\" Dimler, a Republican who served in the House from 1983 to 1986, is most knownfor the amendment that carries his name. Under the so-called Dimler Amendment, drivers who are issued tickets for speeds upto 10 mph over a 55 mph speed limit get abreak. The violators have to pay the fine,but the ticket does not go on their drivingrecord. The amendment, which became law in 1986, has prevented untold numbers ofMinnesotans caught speeding from seeingtheir insurance rates jump. \"If I was driving Highway 15 outside of New Ulm, where the road is designed for 70miles per hour, I'd be driving 64,\" Dimlersaid. And that is the way it should be, accord- ing to Dimler. He has long argued that thesafest speed is the one that is comfortablefor drivers given the conditions of the road. He said that the purpose of the Dimler Amendment is to give the highway patroland the courts the tools to separate trulydangerous drivers from the moderatespeeders. It doesn't bother him that people plea bargain in court to get their speeding ticketlowered to fall under his law. It shows theflexibility that should be in the law, Dimlersaid. \"I've been to court with family and friends, and the judge will \u2014 on his own volition \u2014change the charge to bring it under theamendment,\" Dimler said. \"It's a tool theycan use. They don't have to use it.\" The provision has survived periodic chal- lenges from public safety advocates since itbecame law. Dimler said that the law is stillin effect simply because it's reasonable andpeople like it.Dimler concentrates on farmingafter backing namesake legislation \"It's a popular piece of statute,\" he said. \"I mean, does it truly offend anyone?\" Dimler's life hasn't changed too much since he left the House more than a decadeago. He still answers the occasional ques-tions about the Dimler Amendment and hestill farms his land in Carver and Hennepincounties. Now it's much easier to just concentrate on farming, he said. \"I am truly one of the living citizen- legislators,\" Dimler said. \"I never left mycareer to do it. I made farm decisions fromthe retiring room of the House. SometimesI planted corn at night and came back to theHouse the next morning. It was tough torun the farm and be in the Legislature at thesame time.\" But Dimler does not regret his time in the House. \"I was glad I did it,\" he said. \"It was a life experience.\" And Dimler said that it is an experience that more people should have. He said thatpublic service should be seen as a responsi-bility for everyone and he favors term lim-its in order to maintain Minnesota's citizenLegislature.said. \"No money is going to pay a player'ssalary.\" Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul) said that he is concerned about the city's financialsituation if the state does not choose to pro-vide the $65 million. If the city is forced to issue an additional $65 million, some bond rating agencies have indi-cated that they would lower the city's creditrating, Cohen said. Members of the conference committee also were concerned about provisions in the agree-ment that would prohibit the state from usingbonds linked to arena revenues. Under theagreement, the state cannot use revenues whichwould have an impact on the team. This agreement includes all revenues related to naming rights, concessions, and parking fromgame nights. Other revenue sources such asplayer income tax surcharge may also have animpact on the team and, therefore, may not beconsidered as possible revenue sources. Pam Wheelock, of the city of St. Paul, told the committee that the city would be required tocompensate the team for obligations of this sort. Attempts to build a new Twins stadium last year relied heavily on these revenue sources toservice the bonds. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) told Coleman and Wheelock that this agreementmakes the search for middle ground betweenthe House and Senate very difficult. \"The city has made a contract that pre- cludes us from helping the city out,\" he said. Cohen asked Martha Larson, of the Minne- sota Wild, if the team would consider renego-tiating its lease with the city in order to makesome of these revenue sources available. \"If you are looking for a blanket commit- ment right here and now, I cannot make thatfor the team,\" Larson said. \"The team needs tobe careful when we're looking for middleground that we keep the team successful.\" Several legislators argued that the benefits of the facility justify the full contribution of$65 million. \"Like all things, you can dig around and find bad things,\" said Rep. Steve Trimble(DFL-St. Paul). \"But it's going to be a beauti-ful arena. It's going to add to downtown.\" Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) said that the Minnesota Wild should be applauded formaking a significant investment in the city. Hesaid that the numbers demonstrate the team iswilling to make sacrifices. \"I call this charity,\" he said. \"This is a lousy investment. Bishop said the state should contribute to professional hockey in Minnesota. \"There is pain in the hearts of those of us who love hockey,\" he said. \"I just won't watchthose damn Dallas Stars.\" Dimler wasthe architect of the so-called \"DimlerAmendment.\" Continued on page 175 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 19 - 26, 1998 AGRICULTURE Eliminating a blight Grain farmers from northwestern Minne- sota who, in recent years, have lost significantparts of their crops to a plant disease called\"scab\" are in trouble, and they're asking theLegislature for some help. A bill ( HF3853 ) that Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) sponsors would provide as-sistance to those farmers. The bill was ap-proved March 26 by the House Ways andMeans Committee. \"This is really a dramatic situation,\" Tunheim said. The bill would appropriate $8.5 million from the budget reserve account to help belea-guered farmers in 11 northwestern Minnesotacounties pay for crop insurance. If they've lost50 percent or more of their crops in the 1994to 1997 growing seasons, they would get help. Farmers would receive help equal to half the total premium, to a maximum of $4,000 perfarm. The 11 eligible counties would beBeltrami, Clearwater, Kittson, Lake of theWoods, Mahnomen, Marshall, Norman,Pennington, Polk, Red Lake and Roseau. There are fears that many northwestern Minnesota farmers affected by scab \u2014 alsoknown as Fusarium head blight \u2014 could foldthis spring after five years of difficulty. Rob Rynning, 34, is a Kittson County farmer who, along with his brother, grows canola,flax, soybeans, wheat, and barley on 3,100acres. Scab attaches itself to the kernel of grain crops, eventually rendering the crop unus-able, Rynning said. It's often caused by wetweather, which has been abundant in north-western Minnesota in recent years. Scab began affecting many farms in the early 1990s. \"Minnesotans have lost $1.5 billion to this disease that we've been fighting,\" Rynningtold the committee. If left unchecked, scab could wipe out 50 percent of the farms in northwestern Minne-sota, Rynning said, and that would lead toproblems with the rest of the economy in thatarea and the rest of the state. \"Anybody in the rural economy who deals with the farms is affected,\" he said, adding thathe and his brother lost $80,000 in wheat andbarley in 1997.Researchers at the University of Minnesota are looking for ways to eliminate the blight,but that could take some time, he said. \"We really need something in the short term. The young farmers are already gettingout,\" Rynning said. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), also a farmer, said he sympa-thizes with the plight of the farmers in north-western Minnesota. But farmers are often thevictims of unfair prices and bad weather, andwhen he complains about that, his wife oftentells him, \"Steve, nobody gave you the right tofarm,\" Sviggum said. Rynning said this particular problem is dif- ferent from the usual hardships of farming. \"I don't have the right to farm, but helping out the region is important to the economy,\"he said. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) spoke in support of the bill. \"If farmers weren'tfarming, if loggers weren't logging, and if min-ers weren't mining, some people in the [TwinCities] metropolitan area wouldn't have a job,\"he said. The bill now moves to the floor. Robert Rynning, a farmer from Kennedy, Minn.,testifies in support of a bill that would provideemergency farm relief for northwestern Minnesotafarmers whose crops are infected with wheat scab.Rynning appeared before the House Ways andMeans Committee March 26.BANKING Checks in the mail Restrictions will be placed on theunsolicited checks that some finan-cial institutions mail to consum-ers, under a new law signed by Gov.Arne Carlson March 25. Consumers who find such checks in their mailboxes are actually receiv-ing loan solicitations, carrying interest rates ashigh as 30 percent. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the new law stipulates that no financial institution or lender can sendsuch a check unless it complies with severalnew requirements. The checks will be required to become void after 30 days, and information will have to besent with the check advising consumers todestroy it if they do not use it. Consumers will have to be told in plain terms that the check is a loan, and the loanagreement will have to be on the back of thecheck. If such a check is fraudulently cashed by someone other than the addressee, the con-sumer is to be absolved from liability by sign-ing a statement saying he or she did not cashthe check. The check will have to be mailed in an envelope that does not indicate its contents.Also, it must not be forwarded if the consumerno longer lives at the address. Bill sponsor Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said during House floor discussion of themeasure that he recently received one suchcheck \u2014 for thousands of dollars \u2014 in themail. He said if the check would have been lost or stolen, and cashed, it would have been a hard-ship. He said his legislation puts procedures inplace to protect the consumer. The measure allows an exception for pro- spective borrowers who already have an open-end credit arrangement, such as a credit cardaccount, with a lender. Sen. Michelle Fischbach (R-Paynesville) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2016/SF2550 */CH335 Need a copy of a bill?

The law will cover the debit cards that financial institutions issue toholders of checking accounts. Be- sides getting cash out of automatic teller ma-chines, consumers can use debit cards to makepurchases that are directly deducted from theirchecking account, as long as the merchant hasa terminal that can handle debit cardtransactions. The law will limit customer liability to $50 if the card is lost or stolen. The limit will applyto unauthorized transactions made before thebank receives notice that the card has been lostor stolen. (There is no liability for transactionsmade after the financial institution has beennotified.) A similar liability limit for credit card hold- ers exists in current law. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Edward Oliver (R-Deephaven) sponsoredthe measure.

Ted Winter, right , and Sen. Jim Vickerman, confer. Sen. Doug Johnson, chair of the Senate Committee on Taxes,brought the mock figure of Omann to the hearing because Johnson was displeased by agubernatorial veto of one of his bills. Women and credit history A new law seeks to give divorcedand widowed women a fairer shakewhen applying for loans and creditcards. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the law will require that creditors consider the credit history of an applicant's spouse and thatcredit histories be reported in the name ofboth spouses. House sponsor Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) said the law will help womenwho were conscientious borrowers while mar-ried, but find themselves unable to securecredit after a death or divorce because thecredit history exists solely in their formerspouse's name. \"There are times when an applicant finds she has no credit history,\" Leppik said. \"This[will] give that person recourse to state courtand small claims court. The applicant still hasto establish her own credit-worthiness.\" Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF2309*/SF2136/CH327Signed by the governorReporting fraudulent checks A new law effective Aug. 1, 1998,aims to encourage banks and creditunions to report information con-cerning fraudulent check use to thecrime alert network or law enforce-ment agencies. The law will limit the liability of financial institutions who provide stolen, forged, orfraudulent check information. As long as an institution is acting in good faith when they disclose information, they willbe free of risk of being held liable by thesubjects of the disclosure, under the new law. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) andSen. Ember Junge (DFL-New Hope). HF3389/SF2493*/CH337 BUSINESSSigned by the governor Minnesota's franchise law Northwest Airlines would be unable to use a 1997 law to its advantage in a court battle,under a bill that's headed for the governor'sdesk. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), passed the House March 26.The vote was 128-2. The 1997 Legislature passed special legisla- tion for Northwest Airlines that retroactivelyexempted the airline from Minnesota's fran-chise law.The state franchise law provides franchisees with some degree of protection against un-warranted termination of agreements withtheir parent companies. Legislators recently discovered the retroac- tive exemption had an effect on pending liti-gation against Northwest Airlines. A $30 million lawsuit filed in Maine in 1994 by Northeast Express Airlines and PrecisionValley Aviation claims that Northwest Air-lines violated Minnesota's franchise law whenit dropped the two commuter airlines, forcingthem into bankruptcy. The bill ( HF3841/SF3397* ) would clarify that the 1997 franchise exemption does notapply to any agreements that were subject tolitigation prior to passage of the law. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said the bill would bring backhonor to the words and intentions of the 1997law. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) said Northwest's attorneys willfully used the 1997law as a defense in the Maine case. \"What'stheir excuse \u2014 the devil made them do it?\"Abrams asked. Limited partner regulations Regulations by which a limitedpartner in an investment can with-draw from a partnership will bechanged under a new law signedMarch 23 by Gov. Arne Carlson.

If the agreement con- tains no withdrawal authority, the limitedpartner will not be able to withdraw. Current law allows limited partners to with- draw unless it is specifically forbidden in thewritten partnership agreement. Limited partners invest in a partnership but are usually not subject to the same legal liabili-ties to which the general partners are subject. The new law will apply to partnerships formed after July 31, 1998, and to partner-ships formed earlier that contain a writtenprovision allowing withdrawal. Rep. Bill Macklin (R-Lakeville) and Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsoredthe measure. HF2507/SF3036*/CH320 Getting extended area service It will be easier to petition the Pub-lic Utilities Commission for ex-tended telephone service withinschool district boundaries, under anew law effective March 24, 1998. A 1997 law required a majority of all telephone customers in each exchange tovote in favor of extended area service within aschool district. The new measure, signed by Gov. Arne Carlson March 23, requires only that a major-ity of customers who cast a vote is required toextend the service. Extended area service is often sought in rural areas, where calls from residents to theirchildren's school can result in long distancecharges. While extended area service may re-sult in higher monthly service charges, it doesmake each call within a school district a localcall. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) and Senate Majority Leader RogerMoe (DFL-Erskine) sponsored the measure.

The council was created in 1967 and is responsible for regional planning in the TwinCities metropolitan area. It's one of the largestregional governments in the country and over-sees the regional bus system, wastewater treat- ment facilities, and Metro Mobility, a transitoperation that serves disabled people. The council's annual budget is $360 mil- lion, partially paid by property taxes. It hasabout 3,500 employees who are governed by aboard of directors appointed by the governor.There are 16 members, each representing adifferent region of the metropolitan area, anda chair. The bill would require those members to be elected. HF2588 is sponsored by Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls), who has introduced several billscalling for an elected Metropolitan Council inrecent years, including one last year that passedthe Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. ArneCarlson. This year's bill drew much debate on the House floor. Orfield argued that members of the council should be elected because the council has\"many of the powers of legislative govern-ment. It has broad discretionary authority. \"In many ways, this entity is shaping the future of the region. A body this large, that hasthis kind of taxing authority, should be ac-countable to the people,\" he said. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) spoke against the bill. \"If you don't like how the Metropolitan Council is being run, get another governor,\"Abrams said. \"An elected Metropolitan Coun-cil would be about as useful as a third house [ofthe Legislature].\"Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R-Hastings) said an elected Metropolitan Council would add onemore unnecessary level of government. \"You go under the assumption that it's gov- ernment getting bigger and government get-ting stronger and more centralized,\" he said. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL- St. Paul) said the Metropolitan Council currently is not ful-filling its responsibilities. \"The Metropolitan Council should be pro- viding the coordination and they are not,\" hesaid. \"I would like to be able to sit down withmy Metropolitan Council member and lookat the future directions we're taking. I think anelected body will be accountable to the people.\" The version of the bill the House rejected would not change any duties of the membersof the Metropolitan Council. An earlier version included a provision that would have required candidates for the Met-ropolitan Council to also be candidates for thecounty board in their home county. But thatprovision had been deleted from the bill. Voter registration list update The House passed a bill March 23 that would make voter registration easier for people inMinnesota who move to a new home. The votewas 71-61. Sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), the bill would authorize theOffice of the Secretary of State to get the namesand addresses of people who have given theU.S. Postal Service a change-of-address card.Signed by the governor8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 27, 1998The information then could be given to the appropriate county auditor, who would up-date the voter registration lists. The countyauditor would be required to confirm thevoter's new address by mail. Under current law, voters who move to a new home must take care of registration them-selves \u2014 by visiting the county courthouse, bymail, or by registering at their polling place onelection day. \"It'll just simplify the process so we can start the 21st century before the 21st century,\"Folliard said Critics said the bill would come uncomfort- ably close to making voter registration man-datory. \"This is an unnecessary piece of legislation. I think we should save the governor the troubleof vetoing it,\" said Rep. Phil Krinkie(R-Shoreview). And critics said voters should update their registration and should not count on the stateto do it for them. \"Providing a change of address is the task of a responsible citizen,\" said Rep. Ron Abrams(R-Minnetonka). \"This is a solution in searchof a problem.\" HF2387/SF2149* now goes to the governor. Candidates' endorsement claims Candidates for political office in Minnesota would be required to get written permissionbefore claiming the endorsement of any orga-nization, under a bill the House passed March23. The vote was 73-59. Sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy), HF2277 would stipulate that a can- didate may not claim in campaign materialthat he or she has the support of an organiza-tion unless the organization has providedwritten permission. Tunheim's bill would add organizations such as labor unions and business interests tocurrent law stating that a candidate may notclaim the support of an individual withoutwritten permission. Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) said he sees no need for the legislation because mostcandidates receiving the support of an organi-zation usually get a letter stating such. \"I just don't see that this is an issue of great importance,\" he said. \"It seems to me this is aself-policing type of situation. I just don't seethe need. [It's] more bureaucracy.\" Tunheim agreed that when a candidate is endorsed by an organization, the candidateusually gets a letter from the group. But the billwould make it clear that candidates must have that letter if they're going to mention thesupport in campaign literature. The bill now goes to the Senate. Open absentee balloting A pilot program that allows for open absen- tee balloting in Ramsey County would be ex-tended for another year, under a bill the Housepassed March 23. The vote was 78-54. In 1991, Anoka, Hennepin, Polk, and Ramsey counties entered into a pilot projectfor open absentee balloting. The 1994 Legisla-ture extended the pilot project in RamseyCounty until this year, and the county nowwants the project extended again untilDec. 31, 1999. By law, people who want to vote by absentee ballot must have an acceptable reason thatmakes it necessary to do so. Reasons can in-clude absence from the precinct, illness, dis-ability, observance of a religious holiday, orservice as an election judge. An absentee ballot is mailed or given to the voter, who fills it out like a regular ballot andmails it back to the county auditor's office.The ballots are held until election day, thentallied with all the other ballots. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul), RamseyCounty would continue allowing voters to usean absentee ballot without providing a reason. The pilot project requires only that voters who want to vote absentee apply in writing tothe county auditor's office and provide theirname, address and signature. HF2567/SF2221* now goes to the governor. Absentee ballots with 'reason' Voters could use an absentee ballot for any reason, under a bill the House passed March23. The vote was 68-64. Current law lists a number of acceptable reasons for voting by absentee ballot. Thereasons include absence from the precinct,illness, disability, observance of a religiousholiday, or election judge service in anotherprecinct. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul), would strike that language incurrent law and would require only that voterslist their reason for needing an absentee balloton their application. The bill also would make it illegal to accept money for delivering or mailing an absenteeballot and to attempt to influence a voter whois completing an absentee ballot.Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) expressed concern that voters' reasons for not going tothe polls might become frivolous. \"It could be that they want to stay home and watch Andy Griffith reruns,\" Pawlenty said.\"Why have them put a reason on it? It just goesaround in a circle, and I think we should saywhat we mean and mean what we say. I thinkpeople should show up to vote.\" HF2526/SF2148* goes to the Senate. Absentee ballot without 'reason' Voters in Hennepin County would be al- lowed to vote by absentee ballot without hav-ing to provide a reason for doing so, under abill the House passed March 23. The vote was73-60. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), calls for a pilot project to test themore liberal absentee ballot requirements. Under the bill, voters wanting to vote by absentee ballot could do so without giving areason, as long as they give the county theirname, address, signature, and some otherbasic information. When the bill was discussed by the House General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and Elec-tions Committee in February, Jefferson saidthat his district in Hennepin County consis-tently has the lowest voter turnout in the state. With a high concentration of minorities, renters, and poverty, voter turnout is oftenlow. A result of the low voter turnout is thatcandidates for statewide office rarely cam-paign in some parts of Hennepin County,Jefferson said at the time. Under present law, people wanting to vote with an absentee ballot must have a reason,such as absence from the precinct, illness,disability, observance of a religious holiday, orservice as an election judge. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) objected to the bill and othersthat would expand absentee voting. \"This series of bills bothers me,\" he said. \"The prevailing attitude is that it'sgovernment's duty rather than the voter's duty.There will be a small number of increases inthe number of mistakes that are made.\" Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) said it is impor- tant to make it easier for everyone to vote. \"I wouldn't want to tell any elderly voters that,\" she said in response to Sviggum's com-ments. \"I wouldn't want to tell it to a businessperson who has to be out of town.\" HF2293/SF2118* now goes to the governor.9 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYENVIRONMENT Lottery revenue dedication A bill that aims to extend the life of the state lottery's revenue dedication to the MinnesotaEnvironmental and Natural Resources TrustFund passed the House March 23. The votewas 132-0. HF113*/SF76 , sponsored by Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), would submit the fol-lowing constitutional amendment to voters inthe 1998 general election: \"Shall the Minne-sota Constitution be amended to extend to theyear 2025 the dedication of lottery proceeds tothe environmental and natural resources trustfund and to maximize the long-term totalreturn to the fund?\" The environmental trust fund was estab- lished in 1988 by a constitutional amendmentthat authorized the state to establish a lotterywith 50 percent of the proceeds from the firstfive years earmarked for environmental spend-ing. A second constitutional amendment in1990 changed the designated portion of pro-ceeds to 40 percent until the year 2001. Since 1991, the environmental trust fund has provided 177 projects throughout the statewith approximately $83 million for the pro-tection and conservation of fish, wildlife, andother natural resources. The fund is currentlyvalued at more than $209 million. GAME & FISH GAMBLING Gambling proceeds and the ADA A new law allows organizations touse legal gambling profits to bringtheir facilities into compliance withthe Americans with Disabilities Act. Under previous law, gambling proceeds could be used for con- struction or repairs on only certain types ofproperty. Legal uses included maintainingnonprofit facilities or replacing buildings lostto natural disaster or eminent-domain ruling. But the new law allows any group that earns money from legal gambling \u2014 including pulltabs and lottery tickets \u2014 to use those funds toeither improve handicapped access in a facil-ity or to replace an out-of-compliance facilitywith one that meets ADA requirements. Proponents said this will be useful for orga- nizations such as Veterans of Foreign Wars,which often can't afford to make handicapped-access improvements. The new law also allows licensed gambling organizations to pay salaries and winnings viaelectronic transfer. Under prior law, gambling profits had to follow a paper check trail. Pro-ponents said the new measure will increaseefficiency in large gambling operations. The law, effective March 24, 1998, was spon- sored Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington)and Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy). HF2920/SF2911*/CH322 Hunting, fishing privileges A bill that aims to amend the Minnesota Constitution to protect hunting and fishingprivileges passed the House March 26. Thevote was 118-13. The bill ( HF3808/SF41* ), sponsored by Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul), wouldsubmit the following amendment to voters inthe 1998 general election: \"Shall the Minne-sota Constitution be amended to declare thatfishing, hunting, and the taking of game andfish is a valued part of our heritage, which shallbe forever preserved, and that this privilegeshall be managed by law and regulation for the common good?\" Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), citing the disappearanceof several species from Minne-sota, said she supports the bill on the basis ofenvironmental conservation. \"Because the privilege 'shall be forever pre- served' . . . we will need to redouble our effortsto clean up our waters and expand habitats,\"she said. \"It's a win-win situation, even forthose who choose not to exercise the privilegeto hunt and fish.\" Throughout the committee process, pro- ponents have said the bill would be a first stepin standing up to anti-hunting groups whoseek to curtail the activities of hunting andfishing enthusiasts. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) ques- tioned the reality of the threat posed by animalrights groups. \"I suspect the voters of the state will see the folly of this amendment,\" he said. \"There is noneed for it. There is no threat.\" The bill now moves to the Senate. Fred L. Morrison, professor of law at the Universityof Minnesota, gives a crash course onconstitutional law to members of the House Rulesand Legislative Administration Committee March24. The committee was considering a bill thatwould place a constitutional amendment on theNovember ballot asking Minnesotans if they wantto constitutionally protect the privileges of huntingand fishing. Morrison attended the hearing onbehalf of Pheasants Forever and Ducks Unlimited.HEALTH 'Off-label' drug coverage Cancer patients who find relieffrom certain treatments not ap-proved by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration for their specific formof cancer no longer will have towonder if their health plan will pay for the treatment. A new state law will require health mainte- nance organizations and other health plans topay for \"off-label\" use of drugs prescribed forcancer treatment. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, thelaw will stipulate that all health plans, includ-ing Medicare supplemental coverage, may notrefuse to pay for cancer treatments involvingdrugs that are already on a plan's formulary. \"Off-label\" drug use is the prescribing of drugs recognized as a treatment for at leastone form of cancer in standard medical litera-ture. Cancer specialists indicate about 10 per-cent of their patients respond to treatmentthat is not covered for their specific cancerunder their insurance plan. Drugs are often approved by the FDA for treatment of certain cancers, and further re-search sometimes finds the drug is beneficialfor a wider range of cancers. But drug companies rarely resubmit these medications for FDA approval because of thetime and cost involved. Some health plansthen refuse to pay for use of these prescription Signed by the governorSigned by the governor10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 27, 1998drugs if the medication is not FDA-approved for a specific cancer.

HF1306/SF1076*/CH301 Rendering emergency care Volunteers and others who pro-vide emergency medical care withan automatic external defibrillatorwithout expectation of compensa-tion will not be liable for civil dam-ages under a new law effective Aug. 1, 1998. The law broadens the existing \"Good Sa- maritan statute,\" which provides immunity tovolunteers or untrained people who give emer-gency care, unless a patient objects. Many airlines and businesses now carry automatic external defibrillators, which re-store the heart's rhythm by delivering an elec-tric shock. To use an automatic externaldefibrillator, the rescuer places two pads onthe victim's chest and the device measures theheart's rhythm. If the device detects ventricu-lar fibrillation, the machine directs the user topush a button to deliver a shock. Under the new law, any volunteer or other person who does not expect compensationwill be able to render the emergency carewithout fear of civil liability, unless the persongiving the care acts in a reckless manner. The law will apply only to the scene of an emergency outside of a hospital or otherfacility where licensed practitioners are avail-able. Rep. Geri Evans (DFL-New and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon-sored the measure.

The law also will apply to chil- dren enrolling in kindergarten through theseventh grade beginning with the 2007-2008school term. But the law will exempt familieswho object to the vaccination for religious orother reasons. Hepatitis B is caused by a virus and is spreadSigned by the governorby contact with an infected person's blood orother body fluids. It can also be spread bysharing washcloths, razors or needles, andthrough tattooing. The vaccination processinvolves a schedule of three doses of thevaccine. The disease causes liver inflammation that can lead to liver failure or cancer. Roughly 80 percent of infants receive the vaccination in conjunction with other child-hood vaccinations. The law's purpose is toinoculate those who now do not receive thevaccination. The cost of the vaccination program for those entering kindergarten is covered undera federal program. Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood) and Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick) sponsoredthe measure. HF2681/SF2372*/CH305 Acquiring nonprofit hospitals Gov. Arne Carlson used his vetoauthority March 25 to reject leg-islation that would have madepurchase of nonprofit hospitalsby for-profit chains moredifficult. The measure would have required that whenever a nonprofit hospital proposes totransfer more than 50 percent of its assets orfinancial control to a for-profit group, it mustnotify the state attorney general in writing. The attorney general already has the power to investigate and stop such transactions, butthe legislation would have ensured that writ-ten notice would go to the attorney general'soffice 45 days in advance of any deal. Under the legislation, the attorney general could have made the notice accessible to thepublic if the office determined the public wouldbenefit from the information. The governor wrote in his veto statement, \"I am persuaded that the office of the attorneygeneral can adequately protect the public'sinterest in this area with the authority grantedunder current law.\" Carlson also indicated he thought the bill \"established a litigious, adversarial process forconducting business transactions which I findunnecessary. \"While I recognize the value of community hospitals, I cannot support the wholesale lock-out of noncharitable business entities in themarketplace, which is the effect of the bill.\" He also said, \"In some instances, particu- larly in the case of a financially struggling ruralcommunity hospital, the public may be bestserved by the noncharitable acquisition of theVetoed by the governorINDUSTRYhospital, especially when the only alternativeis closure of the facility.\" Nonprofit hospitals are generally viewed as charitable community assets, but from 1990to 1996 a total of 192 nonprofit hospitalsnationwide were converted to for-profitstatus. Public funds are used for various projects at nonprofit hospitals. If the hospital is acquiredby a for-profit company, the company likelyacquires assets paid for with public dollars,possibly at less than fair-market value. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill. HF381/SF695*/CH330 Telephone assistance plan Minnesotans' telephone bills would increase slightly under legislation the House passedMarch 24 that would expand the telephoneassistance plan. The vote was 68-63. Currently, about 50,000 low-income senior citizens and people with disabilities are cov-ered by the program. However, upcoming expansion of the pro- gram under direction of the Federal Commu-nications Commission (FCC) will include allresidents at or below 150 percent of the federalpoverty level. That means a family of threewith an income just under $20,000 annuallywould qualify. The FCC change would put an estimated 280,000 to 285,000 Minnesota households onthe plan. That would cover more than 15percent of the state's population. The House bill would place a maximum 10-cent monthly surcharge on cellular phones.A current 6-cent surcharge on telephone lineswould increase to 10 cents in about threeyears. Until recently, the federal government and the state paid $3.50 per recipient monthlytoward the assistance program, for a total of$7 in assistance for local telephone service. As of Jan. 1, 1998, the federal share rose to $5.25, plus an additional $1.75 if the statecontributes $3.50. If Minnesota continues tocontribute $3.50, the total assistance foreligible households is $10.50. Some legislators argued that residents should not face a surcharge to pay for some-one else's telephone use. \"We don't do that with food stamps,\" said Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska). \"I don't quiteunderstand why we're asking the general pub-lic to help pay for someone else when maybefor them it's an issue to pay their own phonebill.\"11 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYINSURANCE Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), sponsor of HF3064/SF2718* , said that for many people helped by the program, telephone service is alifeline. Without a telephone, many elderlypeople are cut off from the world, and they aredenied 911 access. Others argued against a surcharge on cellu- lar phones, stating many people use them forbusiness or emergencies and that taxing cellu-lar phones would amount to taxing somephone users twice. The bill now moves to conference committee. A similar bill the Senate passed would in- crease the surcharge to 12 cents a line on July1, 1999, and to 16 cents on July 1, 2000. TheSenate bill has no provision for a cellularsurcharge. Special olympian Bryn Paulson, niece of Rep.

Arne Carlson. Under the law effective Aug. 1, 1998, \"financially strong\" insurers will be allowed to choose to be governed by thenew provisions rather than by current stateinsurance laws, which will remain in place. To use the new investment options, insur- ers will be required to have a minimum of$2 billion in total assets and a total capital andsurplus of $200 million. Insurers who qualify and decide to invest under the new law could invest in anythingwithin a standard considered by the company'sboard of directors, subject to an internal con-trol system. The companies will have to have awritten investment policy. The commissioner of commerce will re- quire information from insurers, and the com-missioner could hire an expert to review aninsurer's investments. The commissioner alsowill be able to order insurers to change theirinvestments. Rep. Ann Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe measure.

HF2814*/SF2130/CH334Signed by the governor LAW A health care directive A plan to consolidate the law regarding health care decision-making seems to be wellon the way to recovery following what ap-peared to be full cardiac arrest on the Housefloor. The bill ( HF2521/SF2050* ), sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R- Rochester), failedMarch 20 on a vote of 67-63 against the mea-sure. The bill was immediately reconsidered and tabled. On March 26, the bill was lifted from the table, amended by Bishop, and passed by thefull House on a 110-21 vote. The bill is based on the recommendations of a working group the Minnesota State BarAssociation sponsored to review current lawon health care decision-making and to suggestways to make the laws more effective. Thegroup is made up of government officials andrepresentatives from health care organizations,consumer groups, and ethical and religiousorganizations. Currently, a patient can create a document that designates the care to be received if he orshe cannot communicate those wishes. Thedocument is called a living will. In addition, apatient can name a person as his or her du-rable power of attorney, which authorizes thatperson to make health care decisions. Theliving will and durable power of attorney pro-visions are contained in two separate statutes. The bill would combine the living will and the durable power of attorney into one docu-ment called a health care directive. The billprovides the criteria necessary for a directiveto be valid. Bishop said that he brought the proposal forward to make an already existing processeasier. He said his bill would encourage morepeople to outline their health care wishes be-fore it is too late. Opponents of the bill argued that the change would make it easier to withhold treatmentthat may prolong life from those who areterminally ill.

A similar bill ( HF2417*/SF2055/Res. 5 ) concerning Poland, the Czech Republic, andthe Republic of Hungary was approved with-out the governor's signature March 5 and aresolution concerning those countries was sentto Clinton and members of Congress. The U.S. Senate is currently debating a mea- sure that would call for admitting those threeformer Soviet-bloc nations to the 49-year-oldpeacekeeping alliance. The three Baltic states are not included in that measure, which was approved by the U.S.Senate Foreign Relations Committee but whichstill needs a three-quarters majority in the fullU.S. Senate for approval. A vote there is ex-pected following a two-week break in April. HF3613 was sponsored by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington). He said the mat-ter was brought to his attention by a Richfieldresident from Latvia who is active in promot-ing Baltic interests in Minnesota. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), a co-spon- sor of the bill, said members of the Balticcommunity in her district had originally asked that their countries be included in the earlierresolution passed by the Legislature. Out ofconcern that that measure would be held upby last-minute changes, a second bill wasdrafted concerning the Baltic countries. Mahon's bill now goes to the Senate. TOURISM Fishing dispute resolution Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) said he knew it was time to take action once long-standing fishing disputes with Canada spawneda proposal for Minnesota's Northwest Angleto secede from the United States. \"We need to indicate the willingness of the state of Minnesota to resolve these differ-ences,\" Anderson said during House floordebate on a bill ( HF3854 ) he is sponsoring. Anderson's measure calls for a resolution asking President Clinton and the U.S. Con-gress to seek a solution to troubles betweenMinnesota and the Canadian province ofOntario. The House passed the bill March 23 on a 124-2 vote. The approximately 85 year-round residents of the Northwest Angle have complained foryears about Canadian policies including fishlimits, user fees, and border crossing permitsthat they say discriminate against U.S. anglers. The Northwest Angle, the northernmost spot of the continental United States, is actu-ally a peninsula on Lake of the Woods that isattached only to Canada. According to Canadian law, tourists fishing the two-thirds of the lake in Canada and stay-ing in Canadian resorts may keep up to twowalleye or sauger per day. Beginning this sum-mer, anglers staying at U.S. resorts will beallowed to keep none of those fish pulled fromCanadian waters. Canadians say the regulations are needed because the species are overfished, but North-west Angle residents claim Canada is drivenby a desire to force tourists to stay at Canadianresorts. U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) intro- duced a constitutional amendment March 18that would let the Angle and nearby islandsseparate from the United States, allowing resi-dents and tourists to enjoy the Canadian fish-ing privileges. The Seventh District congressman said he sees secession as a long shot but that he spon-sored the proposal in order to bring attentionto the plight of Northwest Angle anglers. Healso said the Canadian regulations violate a1909 border-waters treaty and the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement but that thefederal government has not taken action toprotect U.S. rights in the area. On the House floor, several lawmakers who supported Anderson's proposal said they didso because they want to find a solution to theborder turmoil without seeing a part ofMinnesota secede. The bill now goes to the Senate.A related bill, also sponsored by Anderson, would give $25,000 to the Council of StateGovernments to set up meetings betweenMinnesota legislators and members of theManitoba and Ontario parliaments to discussboundary disputes. That proposal was rolledinto the House's omnibus state governmentfinance bill ( SF3354 ), which is currently being considered in a conference committee.

The bill, sponsored by Continued on page 17Lake ofthe Woods13 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Jim Thielman It seems many people believe the streetcar wasn't such a badidea after all. Not long after bus service and a growing dependence onautomobiles pushed out thestreetcar in the Twin Cities, new mass transit alternatives were quicklyunder study. The last of the Twin Cities streetcar lines was shut down during the 1950s. The firstmetropolitan analysis of alternative transitcame barely a decade later in 1967. Now, light rail transit (LRT), which is basi- cally a new generation streetcar, is near tobecoming a fledgling reality in the state undera bonding bill ( HF3843 ) now being consid- ered by a House-Senate conferencecommittee. During the 1960s, discussion of alternative transit in the metropolitan area centered onan underground subway system. Since theearly 1970s LRT, which like a streetcar, runson tracks at ground level, has been heavilydiscussed. And at the end of the 1980s, LRT was ex- pected to become a reality in the state. Newspaper accounts in 1989 forecast the look of public transit in approaching decadeswith grand expectations. \"In the next 10 years, construction of a light rail transit line between St. Paul and Minne-apolis is almost a certainty,\" one report stated.\"By the year 2000, there may be three light raillines operating and a fourth being built.\"Light rail transit . . . In spite of roadblocks, LRT is on brink of reality Interstate 394 was touted at the time as another solution to the metro area's transpor-tation problems. It was called \"a whole trans-portation system\" that would encourage carpooling, bus ridership, and exclusive lanes for\"quicker trips at rush hour.\" A decade later, rush-hour traffic on I-394 is thick, and bus ridership in the Twin Cities hasslipped from 93 million a year in 1979 to 60million annually today. Yet the evolution of LRT has included sev- eral roadblocks and traffic jams. In both 1975and 1985, the Legislature put bans on LRTplanning or spending. The 1975 ban was lifted in 1980, and LRT was immediately selected as the preferredchoice of alternative transportation in an en-vironmental impact statement. The following year, a feasibility study was conducted by the Metropolitan Council, the Minnesota Depart-ment of Transportation (MnDOT), and theMetropolitan Transit Commission. LRT appeared to be gaining serious mo- mentum when legislators created the RegionalTransit Board in 1984. But by 1985 the Legis-lature prohibited spending any public fundson LRT. \"The board was so strongly focused on light rail that everything else became secondary,\"said Bill Schreiber, House minority leader at the time. Schreiber is now director of inter-governmental policy for MnDOT. Study of LRT continued, and in 1986, the Legislature removed the 1985 prohibition andgave regional rail authorities the ability toconduct rail transit planning. In 1988, along with more studies, came new funding initiatives. The Legislature appropri-ated funds for designing a LRT system. In each subsequent year there were engi- neering and design statements, or more stud-ies or more boards, but nothing was built.Finally, in 1992, the Metropolitan LRT JointPowers Board was formed, and the most con-centrated effort toward LRT began. The board, which consists of members from the seven-county metropolitan area, coordi- nates policy development, markets, plans, and advises MnDOT and local committees on LRTimplementation methods. The board and LRT advocates got the best news yet this year. The U.S. Senate passed a $954 million capi- tal improvements bill that includes $50 mil-lion for the first leg of LRT in the HiawathaCorridor, which would stretch from the Uni-versity of Minnesota's West Bank to the Mallof America via downtown Minneapolis and \"This is as close as we've been in 25 years . . .\" \u2014LRT advocate and Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin.Legislators are currently considering a metropolitan-area light rail transit system similar to this one in San Diego, which run s between that city's downtown area and the Mexican border.14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 27, 1998Lawmakers who served in Minnesota's nonpartisanLegislature held split opin-ions about the system. Per-haps not surprisingly, some of their disagreements fell neatly alongparty lines. Not so long ago, the Minnesota Legisla- ture was elected on a nonpartisan basis.Under that system, no party affiliation ap-peared on ballots for legislative races. Minnesota was the first state in the union to have a nonpartisan Legislature. By theearly 1900s, many people in Minnesotaand across the country had become disen-chanted with political parties and \"ma-chine\" politics. The Minnesota law was passed in 1913 to take the party labels out of the legislativeprocess. The Minnesota House was nonpar-tisan until 1974; the Senate was until 1976. According to a survey of legislators taken in early 1972 \u2014 entitled \"Legislator Ap-praisals of the Nonpartisan Minnesota Leg-islature\" \u2014 the majority of lawmakersbelieved nonpartisan elections had weak-ened political parties in Minnesota. However, that doesn't mean the terms \"DFL\" and \"Republican\" were foreign tovoters. Most legislators identified them-selves with one or the other party, and they believed most of the voters identifiedthem as such because most legislators hadannounced their allegiance publicly, eventhough candidates couldn't be identifiedwith a party on the ballot. For the 1972 report, legislators were asked what factors they believed votersused to judge a candidate. Most legisla-tors listed \"personality\" as the top factorin the minds of voters. However, sup-posed party allegiance was also consid-ered a crucial factor \u2014 rating with theirposition on the issues and their pastrecord. Legislators saw some advantages to the nonpartisan system. Many lawmakersbelieved that nonpartisanship weakenedthe system of \"partisan bossism\" and \"thedomination of the Legislature by labor,business, or any other small segment ofsociety.\" And lawmakers of all political persua- sions said that the nonpartisan systemallowed them to \"vote their conscience,\"according to the survey. Legislators alsosaid the nonpartisan system placed moreresponsibility directly on the voters andthat those elected better represented thevoters.However, the 1972 report showed that some DFLers thought the nonpartisan sys-tem weakened their party and strength-ened the Republicans. And Republicans did tend to support retention of the nonpartisan Legislaturewhen the issue was debated in the early1970s. \"Non-party designation makes for less ties with the party, thus fewer dictates bythe parties to the legislators. This makesfor better government. Minnesota is na-tionally recognized for having one of themost effective legislatures in the country.Nonparty designation is mainly respon-sible for this,\" said one Republicansurveyed. Many DFLers had different feelings on the issue. Most DFLers surveyed for thereport said that going back to party desig-nation would improve the Legislature'sperformance. \"Party identification would make the Legislature more responsible, and alsomake the party more responsible,\" saidone DFL lawmaker. \"Party designation will make legislators more responsive to the issues of the day,\"said another DFL legislator. Minnesota \u2014 first state with nonpartisan Legislaturethe Minneapolis-St. Paul InternationalAirport. On March 24, the U.S. House Transporta- tion Committee approved $400 million forthe LRT line in the Hiawatha corridor. U.S. Rep. Martin Sabo (D-Minn.) has said he feels the federal government will eventuallyallocate $200 million in federal money to theHiawatha Corridor. State and local govern-ment will foot the rest of bill. The state wouldbe asked to pay about $100 million, although only about half that amount would be pro-vided in the bonding measures advancing inthis year's Legislature. \"This is as close as we've been in 25 years, which is basically ever,\" said LRT advocateand Hennepin County Commissioner PeterMcLaughlin. \"Congestion is bad and peopleperceive it as bad. Auto occupancy is at itslowest ever in the state, bus ridership is down, and the federal government is looking to help.These are all good signs for LRT.\" Twenty of the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the country use rail as part of their transitsystems. Since 1986, Portland, Dallas, and Den-ver have opened systems. All three cities havea smaller population than the Twin Cities' 2.7million. Denver, at 2.2 million, is closest insize.

Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley) likes the maxim,\"The world belongs to those whoshow up.\" And that should answer any question about her plans to remain involvedin politics despite her announcement that shewon't run for an eighth term in District 36A. \"I don't intend to go and hide, that's for sure,\" she said. \"I think I'll be involved inpolitics until the day I die.\" Tompkins said she plans to spend the sum- mer and fall helping with St. Paul MayorNorm Coleman's gubernatorial bid. \"He's going to need a Republican majority somewhere,\" she said. \"I don't see that willhappen in the Senate, so I plan to help to getthat majority in the House.\" Tompkins has been involved in the political process as long as she can recall. Her fatherand uncle were city council members, and shevividly recalls a childhood of heated politicaldebates at home. When she got older, she became absorbed in precinct caucuses and moved on to manageanother candidate's failed campaign for aHouse seat. \"I think it's in the genes,\" Tompkins said of politics. \"I've been interested in it all my life.The news is always the most important televi-sion program at our house, which tells yousomething.\" Tompkins recalls being devastated when the House campaign she managed didn't re-sult in victory. She was certain she wouldn'tget that involved again. But she reboundedquickly, and the knowledge she gained fromthat failed campaign helped her succeed in herfirst run for the House in 1984. She said she balked when first approached by party members about running for thatHouse seat, and her protests resulted in anexchange she still laughs about. \"I said, 'I'm too short and too fat to run,' but someone told me that would probably cost meonly three percent of the vote,\" Tompkinssaid. Her nine children were grown by then, andRep. Eileen Tompkins . . . Though leaving, member's political life will continue although three of her 22 grandchildren movedin with her after their mother died three yearsago, Tompkins never felt obliged to leave theLegislature and stay at home. \"Plenty of women raise a family and work,\" she said with a shrug. \"The oldest of those isnow 21. They're good kids. They go to thesame schools my kids did, and working in theHouse is much easier than it used to be.\" She recalls floor sessions that ran until 4 a.m. during her early years in the House, andthat members were back in their offices threehours later to start another day. \"It was more a process of wearing you down so you'd finally vote for anything,\" she re-called. \"We did some of our own research andhandled our own constituent services. Therewere many times I remember putting in 14-[to] 18-hour days.\" Her party briefly had the majority in the House then, and there was only a smatteringof women legislators. Now there are morewomen legislators, but her party is the minor-ity. She said she hopes to help change that for Coleman. \"I've got too much energy to not be in- volved with this, and I'll still garden. I love togarden,\" Tompkins said. Gardening is another product of her youth. Tompkins was raised on a farm and, she said,gardening came easily to her. As with politics,she attacked gardening with a rare zeal. Tompkins went to the University of Minne- sota to find a solution to a problem with apatch of raspberries she had planted and endedup taking class after class until she became amaster gardener. But, she said, her years as a representative have taught her things she couldn't havelearned in a classroom. \"I've learned that everybody has worth,\" she said. \"I've volunteered for Catholic Chari-ties, and I've been to the White House. And Ican't tell you there's a big difference betweenstreet people and the President of the UnitedStates. They all have a human spirit.\" Rep. Eileen Tompkins is leaving the House after her seventh term, but she vows to remain active in publiclife.16 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYTracking the Bills . . . March 20 - 26, 1998 CH305-CH337 HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFOnce a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sentto the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when consid-ering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within anappropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differenteffects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsBills await governor's action and files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required. But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sinedie\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a datecertain\"). If the governor does not sign a billwithin this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto.\" Thegovernor is not required to provide a reasonfor the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he or sheobjects. As with all vetoes (save pocket ve-toes) the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the veto with the re-turned bill. Here, too, the timetable is either14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, orwithin three days after the governor receivesthe bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

He said he is most proud of the work hedid on tax classification and agriculture is-sues. \"We were going through the farm crisis and I think we had a pretty large impact at thattime,\" he said. Dimler said he is also proud of what he didn't accomplish. \"Sometimes less is more,\" Dimler said. \"My emphasis in the Legislature was to stop legis-lation. In fact, it's kind of ironic that there's apiece of legislation with my name on it.\" Dimler said that he will continue to do what he's been doing for the past 25 years. \"I guess I'll farm a couple of more years,\" he said. \"Then, who knows, maybe I'll come backand run for the Senate.\" Dimler continued from page 4 BWCA rally Jerry Bahls, of Fridley, lets his canoe paddledo the talking during a rally in the Capitolrotunda March 25.

The provisional license-holder would need to go without an at-fault collision and nomore than one moving violation for a year toqualify for a full license at 17. The teen appli-cant also would need to complete 30 hours ofdriving under the supervision of a licenseddriver aged 21 or older. Under the bill, if the provisional license- holder has two or more violations in 12months, another 30 hours of supervised driv-ing would be required and the driver wouldcontinue under the provisional license. There would be no provisional license for any license applicant 18 or older. The version of the bill that went to the House floor contained a proposed curfew thatwould have forbidden provisional license-holders from driving between the hours ofmidnight and 5 a.m. The midnight to 5 a.m.curfew was removed in a floor amendment. The earlier version of the bill also would have stipulated that a driver could have nomoving violations in a 12-month period inorder to apply for a full driver's license. Thatwas amended on the floor to allow one mov-ing violation. One intent of the original bill was to limit teen driving at night. Although only 20 per-cent of miles driven by teens is accumulatedbetween 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., about half of fatalcar accidents involving teen drivers occur dur-ing those hours. A total of 26 states have some form of gradu- ated teen licensing. The bill ( HF2532/SF2407* ) now moves to a House-Senate conference committee.Graduated licensing continued from page 12 Where to find information House Public Information Office 175 State Office Building(612) 296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550 The House Public Information Office is a nonpartisan office that provides: committee meeting schedules; legislator information; andpublications, including the Session Weekly news magazine, educational brochures for all ages, and member directories.

In the House, the speaker of the House appoints three or fiverepresentatives, and in the Senate, theSubcommittee on Committees of theCommittee on Rules and Administrationselects the same number of senators to formthe committee. The committee meets towork out differences in the two bills and toreach a compromise.Governor Once the governor has the bill,he or she may: sign it, and thebill becomes law; veto it withinthree days; or allow it to become law by not signing it. Duringsession, the House and Senate can override agovernor's veto. This requires a two-thirdsvote in the House (90 votes) and Senate (45votes). The governor also may \"line-itemveto\" parts of a money bill, or \"pocket veto \"a bill passed during the last three days of thesession by not signing it within 14 days afterfinal adjournment.Floor After the full House, or Senate,accepts the committee report,the bill has its second reading. From here, the bill is usually placed on the House and Senate agendascalled General Orders. (A committee canrecommend that a local or non-controversialbill bypass General Orders and go onto theConsent Calendar where it usually passeswithout debate.) 10 11 12Idea 1A bill is an idea for a new law or an idea to change an old law. Anyonecan suggest an idea for a bill \u2014 anindividual, consumer group, profes- sional association, government agency, orthe governor. Most often, however, ideascome from legislators, the only ones who canbegin to move an idea through the process.There are 134 House members and 67senators.Legal form 2The Office of the Revisor of Statutes and staff from other legislative officeswork with legislators in putting theidea for a new law into proper legal form. The revisor's office is responsible forassuring that the proposal's form complieswith the rules of both bodies before the billcan be introduced into the Minnesota Houseof Representatives and the Minnesota Senate.Authors 3Each bill must have a legislator to sponsor and introduce it in the Legislature. That legislator is the chiefauthor whose name appears on the bill along with the bill's file number toidentify it as it moves through the legislativeprocess. There may be up to four co-authorsfrom the House and four from the Senate.Their names also appear on the bill. Introduction 4The chief House author of the bill introduces it in the House; the chief Senate author introduces it in theSenate. Identical bills introduced in each body are called companion bills. The bill introduction is called the first reading . The presiding officer of the House then refers itto an appropriate House committee fordiscussion; the same thing happens in theSenate.Committee 5The bill is discussed in one or more committees depending upon the subject matter. After discussion,committee members recommend action \u2014 approval or disapproval \u2014 to thefull House and full Senate. The Housecommittee then sends a report to the Houseabout its action on the bill; the Senatecommittee does likewise in the Senate.Floor 6After the full House, or Senate, accepts the committee report, the bill has its second reading. From here, the bill is usually placed on the House and Senate agendas called GeneralOrders. (A committee can recommend that alocal or non-controversial bill bypassGeneral Orders and go onto the ConsentCalendar where it usually passes withoutdebate.)How a bill becomes law in Minnesota General Orders 7On General Orders, all House or Senate members, acting as the \"committee of the whole,\" have achance to debate the issue, offer amendments, and present arguments on thebill. Afterwards, they vote to recommend:passage of the bill, progress (delay action), orfurther committee action. And sometimesthey recommend that a bill not pass.Members' votes on General Orders areusually not recorded unless there is a specificrequest to do so. From here, the bill is placedon the Calendar.Calendar 8The Calendar is a list of bills the full House and full Senate vote on. At this point, the bill has its third reading. The bill cannot be amended unless the entire body agrees to it. Here, representa-tives and senators vote on the bill for the lasttime. A bill needs 68 votes to pass the Houseand 34 votes to pass the Senate. If the Houseand Senate each pass the same version of thebill, it goes to the governor for a signature.Special Orders 9Toward the end of the session, the rules committees of the House and Senate designate bills from theGeneral Orders calendar to receive priority consideration. These Special Ordersbills are debated, amended, and passed inone day. The House also has a Rule 1.10calendar which allows the chairs of the Taxesand Appropriations committees to call upfor consideration any tax or appropriationsbill that has had a second reading. TheseRule 1.10 bills are debated, amended, andpassed in one day.19 March 27, 1998 Members List as of January 28, 1998 Note: Room numbers are subject to change. *All rooms are in the State Office Building, St. Paul, MN 5515545A Abrams, Ron (R) ..........................................

Kelly-DFL21 March 27, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYThe University of Minne- sota, which will celebrateits 150th anniversary in2001, is actually older thanthe state of Minnesota. The U of M was founded in 1851. Min- nesota had just become a territory twoyears earlier and would not become a stateuntil 1858. The now-enormous school, which has facilities in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth,Morris, and Crookston and is home to tensof thousands of students, was begun at theurging of Minnesota's first territorial gov-ernor, Alexander Ramsey. Ramsey called for the creation of the university in his second message to theTerritorial Legislature. He and other settlers wanted to make sure youths in the area wouldn't have toleave the area to seek higher education.They also wanted something to fill the livesEarly Minnesotans sought university of their own of the state's young people, and they be-lieved in having an educated citizenry. A St. Paul businessman named William G. Le Duc helped lead the charge. Hewanted Fort Snelling transformed into auniversity, and he circulated petitions tothat effect. The petitions reached Ramsey, and al- though the governor didn't endorse theconversion of Fort Snelling, he did sup-port the concept of a territorialuniversity. Rep. John North, of St. Anthony, then chair of the House Committee on Schoolsin the Territorial Legislature, pointed outthat Harvard had been founded at theMassachusetts Bay Colony when it hadonly half as many people as Minnesotahad in 1851. There was broad agreement that there should be a university; the question waswhere to put it. While the bill was in the House, Rep. Martin McLeod introduced anamendment to locate the university in St.Anthony Falls. Soon after that, both houses of the Legis- lature elected a Board of Regents. One ofthose regents, Franklin Steele, happened toown a tract of land in St. Anthony Falls, andhe offered to donate it for the university'sfirst building. It was a two-story buildingfor algebra, geometry, physiology, andlanguages. Not long after, Steele decided to use the land for commercial purposes, so he took itback. The regents decided to move the cam-pus to a spot about one mile away, which isthe present site in Minneapolis. The landhad earlier been deeded for the universityby the U.S. Congress. The university paid$49,000 to erect the first building on itscurrent campus.

In the closing weeks of the 80th Legislative Session, the Legislature is presently debating decisions onhow to construct surplus revenue proposals that will not impose a governor's veto. Now,they must consider providing emergency funds for the most recent tragedy in and around St. Peter, Minn. Natural phenomena like floods, droughts, forest fires, and tornadoes are never ex- pected. Every time they occur on a large or small scale, they wreak havoc and disrupt thewell-being of all those who directly experience them. In April 1997, the flooding of the Red River caused billions of dollars of damage in western Minnesota. The March 1998 tornadoes destroyed century-old public buildingsand homes that can never be replaced. These are not the only disasters that lawmakers havetaken on to help provide relief. Disaster struck \"when in 1873, a severe blizzard left 70 settlers dead, an uncounted number injured, and thousands of farm animals destroyed.\" The Legislature provided$5,000 for medical, surgical, and other aid. Such was not the case back in 1871 whenfarmers barely survived after their crops were ruined by hailstorms and prairie fires. Gov.Horace Austin called for private contributions for the needy, but this failed, so he calledon the state to help. The Legislature refused, but did offer seed grain. Another tragic phenomenon in Cottonwood County from 1873 to 1878 was the arrival each year of the Rocky Mountain locusts that ate most of the crops. Locust or \"locus ustus\"means \"burnt place\" in Latin. This describes exactly what the \"despicable\" insects leftbehind. Grasshoppers, as the farmers called them, appeared \"as a large black cloud . . . fromwhich came an ominous sound.\" They ate thousands of acres of grain and grasses, andother plants were stripped to nothing but stubble. It was former Gov. Henry Sibley, thenpresident of the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce, who rallied volunteers to financially help.Later, Gov. Cushman Davis was able to get state help with direct relief. One of the worst disasters of all was the Great Hinckley Fire of 1894, when over 418 people lost their lives in fires that engulfed many towns and land in east central Minnesota.While 248 individuals perished just in Hinckley, so did Chief Wacouta and 23 of hisChippewa men who were on a hunting trip. Relief came in from around the country, andtrue to its nature, the Minnesota Legislature, through Gov. Knute Nelson providedcontributions and supplies for those who survived. As life goes on, disasters that affect the lives of Minnesotans will continue to occur. Lawmakers may well make the clich\u00e9, \"a rainy day fund,\" an ongoing reality. \u2014 LeClair Grier Lambert3 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY By Jim Thielman A string of rare spring tornadoes that hit four Minnesota counties with winds approach-ing 200 mph left lawmakers scrambling as theend of the legislative session approaches. The tornadoes that killed two March 29 also collapsed barns, shredded homes, toppledtrees, downed power lines, and prompted astatewide effort to provide aid. Gov. Arne Carlson said a preliminary dam- age assessment and aid bill was expected in thefirst few days of April. He said a one-dayspecial session could be called later this year ifissues beyond the emergency funds need to beaddressed. The regular legislative session is expected to wrap up around Easter. Carlson pledged swift state aid to the area and asked President Clinton to declare theaffected counties a federal disaster area. President Clinton on April 1 declared Brown, Le Sueur, Nicollet, and Rice countiesmajor disaster areas. The declaration frees upfederal money for recovery efforts by resi-dents, businesses, and local governments. Measures moving through the House and Senate also would provide aid. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) said the House and Senate\"try to create a situation in our annual budgetwhere we do have a reserve for these situa-tions,\" and added this year the state is in verygood financial shape to deal with the disaster. The state currently enjoys a forecast budget surplus of $1.9 billion. Officials and residents of the tornado- stricken areas have been invited to testify viainteractive television before the House Waysand Means Committee April 6. \"We want to hear directly from people in affected communities as we work on a tor-nado relief proposal,\" Carruthers said. \"Butwe don't want to take them away from theirimportant tasks. By using the House interac-tive television system, we can, in effect, bringthe committee hearing to them.\" Two-way television links will be established at three sites for the hearing. Almost immediately, three House bills were introduced pertaining to damage the insur-ance industry estimates to exceed the $120million insurers paid during the Red Riverflooding of 1997. (Tornado damage is coveredunder most home insurance policies, whichRelief efforts under way . . . Spring tornadoes ravage south-central Minnesota usually do not provide coverage for flooddamage.) HF3863 , sponsored by Rep. John Dorn (DFL-Mankato), would make an unspecifiedappropriation from the general fund to thecommissioner of public safety to be used as astate match to any federal funds related to thetornado damage. If it is determined any of theappropriation is not needed by Sept. 1, 1998,the unused funds would be returned to thegeneral fund. House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL- Fulda) said it is possible an omnibus disasterbill could be assembled that would includegrain farmers in northwestern Minnesota whohave suffered significant crop loss in recentyears because of a plant disease called wheatscab. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) introduced HF3865 , which would direct the commissioner of revenue to make immediate payments ofhomestead and agricultural credit aid and lo-cal government aid to the areas that havesuffered financial hardship because of the di-saster. The payments would otherwise be madeJuly 20, 1998. Additional financial relief could come un- der HF3868 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Work- man (R-Chanhassen). Workman said there istypically a minimum 17-percent tax on solidwaste disposal, and his bill would allow thecommissioner of revenue to waive that tax for construction debris generated from demoli-tion and repair in the counties designated adisaster area because of the storm. \"It's pretty simple,\" Workman said. \"The bill just says let's not have the state collectunnecessary tax revenue from a disaster.\" Income tax filing extensions for those af- fected by the tornado are also beingconsidered. The day after the tornado struck, three offi- cials of the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA) traveled to the stricken areato inspect damages, as did representatives ofstate agencies. The disaster was particularly surprising in that of the roughly 1,000 tornadoes Minne-sota has recorded in the past 50 years, onlyfour had previously occurred in March. A six-year-old boy and an 85-year-old man died as a result of injuries from the Marchtornadoes, and another 38 people were in-jured, three critically. The historic river city of St. Peter was the largest town hit by the tornado, as windsreached 200 mph over a 140-mile long stretchin south-central Minnesota. (See photo story on pages 16-17 .) A tornado with winds of 260 mph is the highest on the Fujita-Pearson Tor-nado Intensity Scale. About 90 percent of the homes in St. PeterPeter Langsjoen walks through what's left of his parents' tornado-damaged home on North FourthStreet in St. Peter, Minn., March 30.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998were damaged or destroyed. The 137-foot steeple atop Christ Chapel at St. Peter'sGustavus Adolphus College crumpled to theground, and most trees were uprooted on thequaint campus that sits on a wooded hill. \"But the good news,\" said Rep. Ruth Johnson (DFL-St. Peter), \"is the cross atop the steepleis fine, and the stained glass window was notbroken.\" Further good news was that most of Gustavus' 2,350 students were on spring breakwhen the storm swept through. Johnson categorized the mood of the town as \"shocked fortitude.\" \"I was in East Berlin in the '60s before some of the areas of the town that were bombed outin World War II were cleaned up, and it looksa lot like that,\" she said. But, she said, a command center set up in the basement of 116-year-old Nicollet CountyCourthouse \u2014 one of 13 buildings in the townlisted on the National Register of HistoricPlaces \u2014 was operating effectively. \"Our local city officials have been running a command center like clockwork,\" she said.\"There has been good patrolling of the cityand the work of cleaning up is going well. I'veseen badges on people who are helping fromall over the state.\" A team from the Minnesota Historical Soci- ety toured St. Peter and concluded damagedhistorical buildings still have structural integ-rity. There is optimism they can be restored. Johnson said just days after the storm most of the debris had been cleared. \"Things looked better, but with all the trees and debris cleared out of there you could seemore clearly how much damage had beendone to the houses and businesses,\" she said. Johnson also said she hopes the April 6 two- way television hearing, \"will help expedite theprocess of getting help to our region.\" Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), chair of the Ways and Means Committee, said legisla-tors want to hear about the extent of thedamage and the specific needs of the affectedcommunities. \"We know we won't have a complete pic- ture, but it's important for committee mem-bers to hear about the situation as we proceedwith a bill,\" he said. Links for the hearing will be established in South Central Technical College in NorthMankato and at Worthington CommunityCollege.

By Matt Wetzel Former Rep. Todd Otis always had a passion for public service. It was why he joined the Peace Corps, why he ran for the Legislature and servedfor six terms, why he made three unsuc-cessful runs for statewide offices, and whyhe now works as a public affairs consultanthelping people deal with public issues. Otis served in the House from 1979 to 1990, and his career of public service wasalmost inevitable. His father, James C. Otis,was an associate justice on the MinnesotaSupreme Court from 1961 to 1982, hisbrother was in the Peace Corps inThailand, and his grandfather wason the St. Paul City Council. \"I was raised in a family that was very public service-oriented. I grewup with a lot of political discussionand also a feeling of community ser-vice,\" Otis said. Politics and public service were al- ways discussed at the dinner table whileOtis was growing up. Those discus-sions and President John F. Kennedy'scall to the nation's youth for service inthe 1960s inspired Otis to join thePeace Corps in 1967 after he gradu-ated from Harvard University. He was assigned to Senegal, a coun- try in Africa, and worked in a small towncalled Linguere, where he taught English andhelped with community development. Helikened his service in the Peace Corps to hisservice some 10 years later in the Legislature. \"I was so impressed with my colleagues in the Legislature and my co-workers in thePeace Corps. They were bright, public-spirited, very concerned. It was the diver-sity and shared experience,\" he said. After he returned from Africa in 1969, Otis went to Columbia University in NewYork to obtain a master's degree in jour-nalism. He returned to Minnesota in 1970to work in community relations for Day-ton Hudson Corp. and later for First Bank. He married his present wife Jane, in 1977, then went to work as a lobbyist for the Na-tional Federation of Industrial Business. In1978, Gov. Arne Carlson, then a Republicanlegislator from Otis' district in south Minne-apolis decided to run for state auditor. Otissought the DFL endorsement for that Houseseat, received it, and won the election.\"I was elected at a time when we had an energy crisis going, and we were in touchwith those issues,\" he said. His chief con-cerns were energy, education, and economicdevelopment. Otis, who now lives in St. Louis Park with his wife and two children, was born and grewup in the Macalester-Groveland area of St.Paul, graduating from St. Paul Academy. Since leaving the House, Otis has mounted runs for U.S. Senate, governor, and stateauditor. He also has served as state chairmanof the DFL. He said he does not see himselfrunning for statewide office again. Otis stays in public service mode,calls House 'a great place to be' He started his consulting business in 1994, and then in the summer of 1995, hemet the nightmare that every parent fears.His 22-year-old son, Philip, was working asa volunteer conservationist at Mt. RainierNational Park in Washington that sum-mer. In August, while trying to rescue aninjured climber, Philip slipped and fell offa cliff and was killed. \"It changes your life forever. You never get around it, but you try to integrate it into yourlife and you do accept it,\" he said. His minister urged him to take some- thing positive out of the horrible situation,and Otis did that. Philip was a passionateenvironmentalist, and one aspect of Otis'business is working on environmental is-sues. Otis said he thinks of his son whendoing that work. \"His whole spirit, his big signature was his smile. If you don't believe in some formof God, or that we're connected to eachother, I don't know how you can cope withthis kind of reality. It's one of the mostimportant things in my reality,\" he said. Former Rep. Todd Otis' career has taken him from avillage in Africa to the Minnesota Capitol.5 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 26 - April 2, 1998 CHILDREN CRIMEChildren's endowment fund Minnesota voters would decide whether to create a constitutionally protected children'sendowment fund, under a bill the House passedMarch 31. The vote was 68-62. \"It's a vision of making Minnesota the best it can be, starting with its youngest citizens,\"said Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood),sponsor of the bill. The bill ( HF3167/SF2775* ) would submit the following amendment to voters in the1998 general election: \"Shall the MinnesotaConstitution be amended to create a perma-nent endowment fund to enhance the devel-opment of young children through the age offour?\" Research indicates the portions of the brain that control language, emotions, and logicalreasoning develop before a child heads off tokindergarten, Slawik said. The fund would beused to supplement spending on activitiesthat heighten awareness of the importance ofearly brain stimulation and further researchinto early childhood development. A number of states have trust funds for children, Slawik said, including California,Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington.However, those funds are not constitutionallyprotected. The latest annual report by the Children's Defense Fund indicates that the rates of teenpregnancies and violent juvenile crime are onthe rise, Slawik said. \"If you want to stem the increase of crime, curb special education costs, and stop reme-dial education costs . . . you start with chil-dren,\" said Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-ParkRapids), who chairs the Family and EarlyChildhood Education Finance Division of theHouse Education Committee. \"We can help now, or we can pay later,\" Slawik said. The exact source of funding for the children's endowment would not be decided until the1999 Legislative Session, if the amendment issuccessful at the polls. Potential sources of initial funds for the endowment include surplus dollars in statecoffers, a portion of any proceeds from thestate's tobacco lawsuit, and tax-deductiblecontributions from individuals, corporations,and foundations.Proponents compared the idea to the Min- nesota Environmental and Natural ResourcesTrust Fund \u2014 supported by state lottery rev-enue \u2014 that was established by a constitu-tional amendment in 1988. \"We did it for the animals. We did it for the fish. We should be doing it for children,\" saidRep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls). Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) argued that the environmental fund is different becausevoters knew beforehand exactly how that fundwould be structured and financed. The lack of a predetermined revenue source for the children's fund led to a debate on theHouse floor. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said the bill potentially couldamount to \"a billion dollar tax increase.\" Critics repeatedly asked Slawik about how the state would pay for the children's fund. \"I hope you're going to show us the money,\" Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) said. \"Ifyou really want to help children, get out ofmom and dad's wallet.\" The issue is expected to go to a House- Senate conference committee because the ver-sion of the bill the Senate passed March 18differs significantly from the House version. The Senate bill would rename the state per- manent school trust fund as the \"children'sendowment fund.\" The school trust fund,which currently is managed by the Depart-ment of Natural Resources, is supported byincome from timber sales and state land leases.Proceeds are divided annually among schooldistricts across the state. Under the Senate bill,money from the school trust fund would in-stead be earmarked for activities that supportthe development of children through age six. Omnibus crime prevention bill A slightly altered omnibus crime preven- tion bill ( SF3345 ) is on its way to the governor's desk. The full House accepted the conferencecommittee's adjustments and gave the billfinal passage April 1. The vote was 89-40. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Rep. Wes Skoglund(DFL-Mpls), contains most of the major crimeinitiatives and public safety funding for thissession. Several provisions in the earlier House billdid not make it into the conference committee's final version. The so-called \"threestrikes\" provision, backed by Rep. CharlieWeaver (R-Anoka), was one such casualty ofconference committee. This provision would have required life imprisonment for criminals convicted of threeviolent felony-level crimes. The provision alsoincluded language for judicial discretion inapplying the new sentence requirements. Another section left out of the conference committee's bill would have opened somejuvenile court records and proceedings to thepublic. For juveniles under 14 years old, the provi- sion would have made court records availableto the public if the juvenile is found guilty of athird felony or gross misdemeanor level of-fense. For juveniles who are 14 years old orolder, the provision would have opened allcourt hearings to the public, regardless of theoffense. The records would have been closedto the public when the juvenile turns 21. Here are some highlights of the omnibus crime prevention bill. Getting tough The omnibus crime prevention bill includes several provisions aimed at lengthening pen-alties for certain crimes. The bill also would increase penalties for felons convicted of violent offenses who arefound illegally in possession of a firearm. Cur-rently, the mandatory minimum prison sen-tence is 18 months; the bill would increase themandatory minimum to five years. Another provision in the bill increases pen- alties generally for soliciting a prostitute orreceiving profit from prostitution. This provi-sion also increases the penalties for engagingin prostitution in a school zone. Charging burglars A provision of the omnibus crime bill would make it easier to prosecute people who ille-gally enter a property by expanding the defini-tion of burglary to include accomplices. Prosecutors said the new language would make the law more explicit and allow them tobring charges against anyone who illegallyenters a dwelling, even if they don't actuallybreak in or steal something.6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998DWIProsecuting gangs Prosecutors also told legislators that they are having difficulties bringing gang membersto trial and making the penalties stick. Severalprovisions in the omnibus crime bill seek toaddress such concerns. One provision would expand a current law that provides increased penalties for crimesdone for the benefit of a gang to include crimesmotivated by \"involvement with\" a gang. Thisprovision also increases these enhancedpenalties. The bill would increase penalties for wit- ness tampering and would add witness tam-pering to the list of crimes that can receiveenhanced penalties if done for the benefit of agang. The bill also seeks to get people to show up for court, both offenders and witnesses. Oneprovision would increase the penalty for fail-ure to appear in court if charged with a felonylevel crime. Another provision would increase penalties for individuals who knowingly and willinglydefy a court subpoena to appear in relation toa violent crime. Fighting drugs The omnibus bill would increase the penal- ties for manufacturing, possessing, or sellingmethamphetamine. Law enforcement officialssaid that Minnesota is seeing a dramatic in-crease in use of the drug. The bill would raise the drug to the same status as cocaine and heroin and would makethe manufacture of any amount of metham-phetamine a first-degree controlled substanceoffense. The bill also makes the drug ephedrine a controlled substance, to be dispensed only byprescription in most instances. The targetedover-the-counter products containing ephe-drine are reportedly taken by teenagers andothers looking to achieve a legal high. Drive-by shootings A provision in the omnibus bill makes mur- der committed during a drive-by shooting afirst-degree murder crime, increasing theprison sentence for the offense. The crime bill would also raise the maxi- mum penalty from a five-year prison term toa 10-year term for firing into an occupiedvehicle. Murder-kidnapping Another provision in the bill would classify murder committed in the course of a kidnap-ping a heinous crime. A person convicted ofsuch a crime could be sentenced to life with-out parole, Minnesota's toughest sentence.Protecting police officers Several provisions in the bill seek to make it easier and safer for police officers to do theirjob. One such provision comes as a result of an incident where two Richfield police officerswere accused of sexual assault. Although theallegations were proven false, the incidentgreatly disrupted the criminal justice process,not to mention the lives of the two officersinvolved. The provision would make it a criminal violation to harass police officers because ofthe performance of official duties. This provi-sion would also add police officers to a list ofjudicial officials who are protected from retal-iatory harassment under current law. Another provision would authorize officers to conduct pat-down searches on juvenilestaken into custody. Under current law, pat-down searches can be performed only on adult offenders. Propo-nents of the change argued that police officersneed to be protected from juveniles, as well asadults, carrying concealed weapons. Financing justice The bill contains $7.9 million in supple- mental appropriations, a majority of whichwould go to the Department of Corrections,the Department of Public Safety, and the statecourts. Of the total amount, $3 million would be recouped in revenue from increased criminaljustice fees and criminal fines. The Department of Corrections would re- ceive $2.1 million, much of which would go toreducing the caseload for probation officers.Grant programs which fund community cor-rections would also be funded through thesedollars. The Department of Public Safety would be appropriated $1.6 million. Of these funds, theoffice of the Crime Victim Ombudsman wouldreceive $300,000 to fund its services; theBureau of Criminal Apprehension would re-ceive $133,000 to add forensic scientists to itscrime lab; and the department would get$750,000 for law enforcement and commu-nity crime prevention grants. The state fire marshal would receive $170,000 of public safety money for the cre-ation of an arson data system. The databasewould contain only basic information at thestate level but would provide links to localcriminal justice agencies for more detailedinformation on specific cases of arson. The bill would appropriate $1.1 million to the state courts for law clerk salaries. The statepublic defender would receive $1 million fordefense attorney salaries. Another $375,000would be given to Legal Aid to provide legal service to low-income individuals. Legal blood-alcohol limit With surprising speed and hardly any de- bate, the House passed a bill April 2 that wouldlower Minnesota's legal blood-alcohol con-centration limit. The vote was 79-46. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), would lower the per se blood-alcohol concentration limit from 0.10 percentto 0.08 percent. The bill ( HF2389/SF2099* ) now goes to conference committee where lawmakers willattempt to work out the differences betweenthe House and Senate versions of the bill. The Senate bill would apply the lower 0.08 percent limit only to repeat DWI offenders.The 0.10 percent limit would remain the limitfor all other drivers. Proponents of the lower standard for all drivers argue that the new standard is reason-able and that it will result in a reduction inMinnesota's DWI-related traffic fatalities. The average male would have to drink four standard drinks in an hour and the averagefemale would have to drink three standarddrinks in an hour to reach that level, accordingto the National Highway Transportation SafetyAdministration. Opponents contend that the new standard would unfairly target social drinkers and takevaluable resources from the real problem, re-peat DWI offenders. Repeat DWI offenders Effective March 26, 1998, a newlaw authorizes state courts to sen-tence repeat DWI offenders to anintensive probation program inplace of mandatory jail sentences.Gov. Arne Carlson signed the mea- sure March 25. Intensive probation programs seek to pro- vide alternative sentencing for those DWI of-fenders considered to be of high risk to thecommunity. These programs require a period of incar- ceration in a treatment facility followed bysupervised home detention. Offenders areprohibited from using alcohol or drugs andare frequently tested for use throughout theprobation. Offenders are also required to paya substantial portion of program costs. The Department of Corrections has a grant program in place to assist counties interestedSigned by the governor7 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYELECTIONSin establishing intensive probation programs. Correction officials said that they receivedrequests from 13 counties this year. Officials from Dakota County said that an evaluation of their intensive probation pro-gram showed a recidivism rate of 11 percent.They said the rate for those incarcerated with-out the program was 43 percent. The officials said it is difficult to get a repeat offender into the program voluntarily after heor she has already done jail time. Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon-sored the legislation. HF2615/SF2252*/CH332 Updating voter lists Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billMarch 31 that aimed to make iteasier for people who move tonew homes to update their voterregistration information. The bill would have authorized the Office of the Secretary of State to get names and ad-dresses of people who have given the U.S.Postal Service a change-of-address card. The bill called for the secretary of state to then send the information to the appropriatecounty auditor and for the auditor to confirmthe voter's new address by mail. In his veto message, the governor said he vetoed similar legislation in 1997 and that hestill has the same concerns. He then listedthose concerns as follows: \"1) Where a personreceives their mail is not necessarily alwayswhere they reside and vote; 2) Establishing theresidence of thousands of potential voters is aculmination of many factors that may notalways be reflected by an automatic processfor registration; and 3) The unintended out-come of this process may actually be moreconfusion on the part of the electorate,\" hewrote. Carlson said any change in election law is too important and should have bipartisan sup-port. The bill passed 71-61 in the House and46-14 in the Senate. \"Even if my concerns were entirely satisfied, I could not support any changes to our elec-tion laws when only three Republican mem-bers in the House of Representatives, andrelatively few in the Senate, supported the bill.Changes such as those proposed in this billshould have at least modest bipartisan sup-port before becoming law,\" he wrote.Vetoed by the governor Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) spon-sored the bill. HF2387/SF2149*/CH346 Open absentee balloting Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billMarch 31 that would have ex-tended Ramsey County's openabsentee ballot program. In his veto message, Carlson questioned the need for its continuation. \"The project has been in existence since 1991,\" he wrote. \"At what point do we bring apilot project to an end? What information, other than what has already been gathered,does the county hope to obtain? And whatdoes the county intend to do when the projectexpires in two years? We know what the ben-efits and drawbacks of this program are \u2014 it'stime to end it and take up the larger debate ofapplying it to all citizens of the state.\" In 1991, Anoka, Hennepin, Polk, and Ramsey counties entered into a pilot projectfor open absentee balloting. The 1994 Legisla-ture extended the pilot project in RamseyCounty until this year. Under the pilot project, people don't need a reason to vote absentee, they just need toapply in writing at their county auditor's of-fice. (State law dictates that people who wantto vote by absentee ballot must have an ac-ceptable reason, such as absence from theprecinct, illness, disability, observance of areligious holiday, or service as an electionjudge.) An absentee ballot is mailed or given to the voter, who fills it out like a regular ballot andmails it to the county auditor's office. Theballots are held until election day, then countedwith the rest of the ballots. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul)sponsored the bill. HF2567/HF2221*/CH347Vetoed by the governor EMPLOYMENT Absentee ballots with 'reason' Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billApril 2 that would have allowedvoters to use an absentee ballotfor any reason. Current law lists a number of acceptable reasons for voting by an absen-tee ballot. The reasons include absence fromthe precinct, illness, disability, observance of areligious holiday, or election judge service inanother precinct. The bill would have stricken that language in current law and required only that voterslist their reason for needing an absentee ballot on their application. In his veto message, Carlson said he was concerned about the party-line vote on thebill. \"Significant changes to election laws such as those proposed in this bill are too importantto be entirely one-sided and lacking in bipar-tisanship,\" Carlson wrote. The bill was widely opposed by Republican legislators. \"Changes should have at least modest sup- port from both sides of the aisle before beingsigned into law, and certainly not the vocifer-ous opposition that accompanied this andother election law bills,\" Carlson wrote. Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsoredthe bill. HF2526/SF2148*/CH352 Essential employee status Emergency dispatchers would become es- sential employees and lose the right to strike,under a bill the House passed March 30. Thevote was 77-50. Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) is sponsoring the legislation, which he said isnecessary because a strike by dispatchers couldthreaten public safety. Under the bill, police, fire, and 911 dis- patchers would join law enforcement person-nel, health care workers, prison guards, andothers who are considered essentialemployees. Under that status, workers give up the right to strike, but they can still request arbitrationin a labor dispute. The Minnesota Sheriff's Association, Min- nesota Professional Firefighters Association,Law Enforcement Labor Services, and several911 dispatchers testified in support of the billat an earlier hearing before the House Labor-Management Relations Committee. Because the proposal was supported by employees, employers, and the union, manylawmakers said they would support it at thattime. But Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) urged his colleagues to oppose the bill, whichhe said could lead to more employees losingtheir right to collectively bargain. \"It is at times essential for people to go on strike and walk the picket line so that theirfellow workers can benefit,\" he said. The League of Minnesota Cities and the Association of Minnesota Counties also op-posed the bill. Vetoed by the governor8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998On the House floor, Rukavina offered an unsuccessful amendment that would have re-quired employers who offer workers anti-union information during work hours to alsooffer equal time to union organizers. \"This is a matter of equal time,\" Rukavina said. \"It doesn't hurt any employer who is agood employer \u2014 and I believe most of themare.\" Lawmakers who said they are wary of im- posing any new restrictions or mandates onemployers defeated the amendment. The bill ( HF1693/SF1074* ) now goes to the governor. ENVIRONMENTHibbing workers' benefits About 20 workers temporarily laid off from the Hibbing Taconite Co. in St. Louis Countywould receive extended re-employment ben-efits under a bill the House passed March 30.The vote was 74-52. The workers were laid off between July and September 1997 because of lack of work. Thecompany says it expects to have them back towork by the end of May, but the employees'regular unemployment benefits ran out overthe winter. HF3465 , sponsored by Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm), would allow theHibbing workers to receive up to 13 addi-tional weeks of benefits. Current law grants those additional ben- efits to workers who are affected by a large,permanent layoff in a county with a highunemployment rate. Tomassoni's bill would exempt the Hibbing workers from three requirements: that thelayoff be of a certain size, that it be permanent,and that it occur in a county where the unem-ployment rate is more than 10 percent. Theworkers would still have to meet requirementsspecifying that they be otherwise eligible forunemployment and that they have exhaustedall other rights to benefits. Tomassoni said the average benefit of the affected workers is $331 per month, and thetotal extra benefits would be about $128,000.He also said that the company, since it is stillin business, would end up paying for most ofthat amount in tax. Workplace breast-feeding The House gave final passage to a bill April 2 that would require employers to make \"rea-sonable efforts\" to provide adequate privatespace and unpaid breaks for new mothers topump breast milk. The vote was 106-23. The bill ( HF3459/SF2751* ) had gone to aconference committee after the House added a provision specifying that businesses couldnot be held liable if reasonable efforts to com-ply with the potential law had been made. The Senate bill did not contain such lan- guage, but the provision was approved by theconference committee and remains in thefinal bill. The bill would require employers to pro- vide \"a room or other location, in close prox-imity to the work area, other than a toiletstall,\" where a woman could privately pumpbreast milk. Under the bill, the break times would run concurrently with any other provided breaks.Employers would not have to provide thebreaks if doing so would \"unduly disrupt theoperations of the employer.\" The bill also contains a provision that clari- fies that breast-feeding would not be consid-ered indecent exposure under the law. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), now goes to the governor. Personal watercraft operation A bill that aims to regulate personal water- craft operation on Minnesota lakes was ap-proved by the House April 1. The vote was75-52. \"It would provide people with some relief and still allow for courteous operation of per-sonal watercraft,\" said Rep. Kris Hasskamp(DFL-Crosby), sponsor of the bill. The bill would reduce the hours for legal operation of personal watercraft, expand theno-wake zone on all lakes, and set up proce-dures for citizens to lodge civil complaintsagainst personal watercraft operators who vio-late the law. The April 1 debate was the third time the bill had come up on the House floor in two weeks.In the face of opposition to her proposal,Hasskamp had twice delayed a vote to allowtime for changes meant to appease critics. Under the bill, personal watercraft opera- tion would be permitted only between9:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. or one hour beforesunset, whichever is earlier. Current law al-lows personal watercraft use between 8 a.m.and sunset. The bill would add another 50 feet to the no-wake zone, making it illegal to operate apersonal watercraft at full speed within 150feet of shoreline, docks, swimmers, or otherboats. However, it still would be permissibleto pull water-skiers behind personalwatercraft.Another provision would prohibit \"trick- sters,\" Hasskamp referred to them, fromoperating personal watercraft while facingbackwards. The provision that drew the most criticism would allow individuals to lodge citizen com-plaints with law enforcement representativesagainst operators who violate personal water-craft laws. Such a complaint would have toinclude a sworn statement or a videotape.Peace officers could then, in turn, issue a civilcitation to the personal watercraft owner. The citizen reporting measure was designed around language in current littering and tres-passing laws, Hasskamp said. \"I believe if we can provide the citizens with some sense of justice \u2014 access to law enforce-ment \u2014 then we can say we've done some-thing significant this year,\" she said duringfloor debate March 31. Critics objected to the citizen citation clause because of the potential for frivolouscomplaints. \"If the individual were frivolously bringing [the complaint] forth, they could be guilty ofperjury,\" Hasskamp said. \"If you don't think perjury is serious, you just have to talk to Monica Lewinsky,\" saidRep. John Tuma (R-Northfield). The bill ( heads to a House-Senate conference committee because,among other differences, the Senate version ofthe personal watercraft bill does not contain acitizen complaint clause. Lottery revenue dedication A new law effective Aug. 1, 1998,will allow voters to extend the du-ration of the dedication of statelottery revenue to the MinnesotaEnvironmental and Natural Re-sources Trust Fund. Under the law, voters in the 1998 general election will decide the following question:\"Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amendedto extend to the year 2025 the dedication oflottery proceeds to the Environmental andNatural Resources Trust Fund and to maxi-mize the long-term total to the fund?\" The fund was established by a constitu- tional amendment in 1988. At the time, thestate was allowed to earmark 50 percent of thelottery proceeds for the environmental fund. A second constitutional amendment in 1990 reduced to 40 percent the portion dedicated tothe environmental fund. That dedication ex-pires in 2001.

The fund's current value is about $210 mil- lion. About $22 million was dedicated forprojects in the current biennium. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. Steven Morse (DFL-Dakota) sponsoredthe new measure. Gov. Arne Carlson signed itinto law March 27. HF113*/SF76/CH342 FAMILY Family, early childhood bill Minnesota's families would receive $14.9 million in state dollars under the omnibusfamily and early childhood education spend-ing bill that won final passage in the HouseApril 1. The vote was 81-47. The bill ( HF2803/SF2532* ), sponsored by Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids), wouldappropriate money for programs such as HeadStart and Early Childhood Family Education,fuel assistance, and drug and violence preven-tion programs. The bill now goes to the governor.Here's a look at some of the major provi- sions that were agreed upon by a House-Sen-ate conference committee. Child care assistance The bill would appropriate $5 million for a program that helps low- and moderate-in-come working families pay for child care usingan income-based, sliding-fee scale. Another1,700 families who are on a waiting list for theBasic Sliding Fee program could be covered,Kinkel said. Also, a portion of the moneywould ensure that parents who are on a wel-fare-to-work path continue to receive childcare assistance. Under the bill, an additional 17,000 families could qualify for the Minnesota dependentcare tax credit program. The bill would raisethe maximum income threshold from $31,000to $38,000 at a cost of $4.9 million to the state.The average dependent care tax credit is $317per year. Investing in the family A proposal that would allow low-income families to contribute money to a \"family assetaccount\" and receive matching dollars fromthe state or a private organization would re-ceive $775,000. The family assets for independence initia- tive was the top-ranked program to be ap-proved by the Family and Early ChildhoodEducation Finance Division of the House Edu- cation Committee, Kinkel said. To qualify, a family must have an income level at 200 percent of the federal poverty levelor less (or $26,700 for a family of three) andassets of $25,000 or less. The matching funds would be kept in a separate account, and the family would notget the money until they have finished aneconomic literacy course and achieved theirgoals for one of three approved purposes \u2014buying a home, paying for an education, orstarting a business. Other states are considering similar pro- grams and similar legislation is pending inCongress. The program would be administered by the Department of Children, Families andLearning. Helping the homeless The Department of Children, Families and Learning estimates that there are 21,000 home-less children in Minnesota. The spending billwould appropriate $900,000 for emergencyservices grants to provide shelter, medical careand other assistance to the homeless. Another$1 million would be spent on transitionalhousing programs.Gang prevention The bill would appropriate $200,000 for gang prevention and intervention. The funding would be available for local organizations to reach children and youngadults who are either at risk for criminal ganginvolvement or who have expressed interest interminating their gang affiliation. After-school activities, job skill training, and counseling are among the services thatwould be offered to the young people. Lead contamination The bill would appropriate $200,000 for the clean up of lead-contaminated residential sitesaround the state. Of this amount, $50,000would be earmarked for the city of St. LouisPark to complete a lead abatement project ina residential neighborhood surrounding anindustrial site. A call for help First Call For Help is a social services infor- mation and referral telephone hotline thatwas developed 50 years ago by the United Wayof Minneapolis. In 1997, the program received 350,000 calls \u2014 a 20 percent increase over 1996. The bill would appropriate $100,000 to ex- pand the successful First Call for Help into\"First Call Minnesota,\" a statewide computersystem database of health services, social ser-vices, educational programs, housing infor-mation, and employment services. Child care projects The bill also would transfer approximately $5 million in federal Temporary Assistance toNeedy Families funds to the Department ofChildren, Families, and Learning for severalchild care projects. Among the provisions is a plan to make available more nonstandard-hour care. Thenumber of parents seeking child care duringevening and overnight shifts is projected toincrease dramatically with the recent overhaulof the federal and state welfare system. The department would receive $500,000 for grants to public and private agencies to pro-vide child care during these nonstandard work-ing hours and to research the changing face ofchild care in the age of welfare reform. Under the bill, $2.2 million would be ap- propriated for child care service developmentgrants to child care providers for business andlicensing assistance and multiculturaloutreach. The outreach would include providing in- formational brochures on licensing and childcare options in all of the predominant non-English languages in Minnesota.10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998GOVERNMENTThe bill also would direct $300,000 toward an education loan forgiveness grant programfor child care workers. The child care industryconsiders low wages to be one of the biggestchallenges in the field. It is often difficult forchild care workers to afford continuing edu-cation or pay back student loans. State government finance bill Although the baseball stadium controversy has received little attention from lawmakersthis year, the Metrodome turned up at theheart of opposition to the omnibus state gov-ernment finance bill that won final passage inthe House April 1. The vote was 71-56. Calls to send the bill back to conference committee came from Republicans and DFLersalike, who were upset that Senate confereesdefeated a provision from the original Housebill that would have prohibited the Metro-politan Sports Facility from contracting with aprofessional sports team to play in theMetrodome for less than a seven-year period. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), who moved to send the bill back to conference, said shewas frustrated because she felt senators hadrejected \"out of hand\" provisions that Houseconferees considered essential. She said the stadium lease agreement would be the only way to ensure that a repeat of the1997 stadium debate doesn't dominate futurelegislative sessions. \"We thought we should be able to debate [stadium funding] without the threat of theteam leaving,\" she said. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) agreed with Kahn, and said the lease clause would bethe only way \"to protect the people of Minne-sota from yet another stadium debate that willconsume the 1999 session.\" But other lawmakers, including Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City), urged colleagues tokeep government out of baseball, and Kahn'smotion was defeated. Osskopp also argued that a bill with the stadium-lease provision would almost cer-tainly elicit a gubernatorial veto. That, Osskoppsaid, would punish the Office of the AttorneyGeneral the most, because its 1999 operatingbudget, vetoed last year, is in this year's bill. Here's a look at key provisions of the state government finance bill ( HF3137/SF3354* ), which now goes to the governor. Attorney general's budget The bill would provide $24.1 million for the attorney general's 1999 expenses. That's just$100,000 more than was in the House bill thatwent to conference committee, but $331,000 less than requested by the office and earlierapproved by the Senate. The extra $100,000 is earmarked for a fund that would educate senior citizens abouttelemarketing fraud. The original House billwould have directed that such a program beset up, but would not have provided funding. The rest of that office's budget would be distributed as follows: $23 million for generalfunctions, $500,000 for legal services to stateagencies, $250,000 for gaming enforcement,and $250,000 to assist counties with felonyprosecutions, community notification of sexoffenders, and related tasks. The office's budget was in question because Gov. Arne Carlson used his line-item vetoauthority to strike its proposed 1999 fundingfrom the 1997 state government omnibus fi-nance bill, citing what he called unnecessaryand excessive growth in the office. This year's bill also calls for a task force to study the availability, effectiveness, and costof legal services provided by the attorneygeneral. Community-based planning A much debated plan to extend a state advi- sory council on community-based planningwas voted out of the omnibus state govern-ment bill in conference committee. The House version contained a proposal to expand membership on an existing advisorycouncil and to extend the life of the council forsix months until Dec. 31, 1998. The councilhelps communities set up long-range land-use plans on a voluntary basis. But several Greater Minnesota lawmakers have said throughout the session that theydon't believe such a program would remainvoluntary for long \u2014 and that they don't wantmetropolitan-area help for rural planning. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), House sponsor of the omnibus bill, said on the Housefloor that he was not sorry to see this provisiongo in conference committee. \"I tried to give some assurance to those of us who live in rural Minnesota that this volun-tary program would not become mandatory,\"he said. No small gifts Also stripped in conference committee was a provision that would have allowed lawmak-ers to receive gifts worth less than $5 fromlobbyists. The earlier House version of the bill would have exempted those small gifts from the cur-rent ban on public officials accepting any-thing of monetary value from lobbyists orothers with a stake in a government decision. Rukavina said the ban should be relaxedbecause it limits lobbyists' access to legislators by making even a cup of coffee an illegal gift. Senators who opposed the provision said they did so because they felt it was slipped intothe House bill without sufficient debate andwas never brought up in the Senate. Studying feedlots The final version of the bill also would give $1.3 million to the Office of Strategic andLong-range Planning to fund a three-year studyof the effects of the livestock industry on thestate's economy and environment. A committee would be required to submit an environmental impact statement to theLegislature and could consider factors such asgovernment regulation of feedlots, potentialownership arrangements, and the impact ofcurrent feedlots. Perpich's portrait Another part of the bill would direct that the state must accept a portrait of former Gov.Rudy Perpich and wife, Lola, if a private donorprovides funds for one, and that the new por-trait would be substituted for the portrait ofPerpich currently hanging in the Capitol. Near the end of his time in office, the former governor pushed to have his wife included hisportrait, and the matter became the subject ofsignificant controversy. Portraits of each former Minnesota gover- nor hang throughout the corridors of the Capi-tol, and each of the governors is picturedalone. The portrait of Perpich now found onthe ground floor of the Capitol shows theformer governor standing alone with an ironore mine in the background. Settling border disputes Also remaining in the final bill is $25,000 that would go to the Council of State Govern-ments to set up meetings between Minnesotaand Canadian lawmakers to discuss boundarydisputes, including fishing laws. Fiber-optics plan remains A House plan that would have delayed implementation of a controversial fiber-op-tics contract is no longer in the omnibus bill. The contract in question was signed in Janu- ary, giving exclusive rights to one company tolay fiber-optic cables along the state's highwaysystem. The House proposal would have de-layed the contract until a report on its legalitywas completed. The stripping, in conference committee, of this provision was \u2014 along with the loss of thestadium-lease provision \u2014 the reason Kahnsaid she wanted to send the bill back toconference.11 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY\"Many people believe this contract is anti- competitive,\" she said. Administration Under the bill, the Department of Adminis- tration would receive the followingappropriations: $4.3 million to help update government com- puter systems to address problems associ-ated with the year 2000; $315,000 to Pioneer Public Television to build a tower in Otter Tail County, currentlythe only part of the state that does not re-ceive a public television signal; $150, 000 to coordinate the Minnesota Alli- ance with Youth initiative; $44,000 to make the state register and guide- book to state agencies available on theInternet free of charge; and $20,000 for a portrait of Carlson to hang in the Capitol. Donating 'distressed' foods Food handlers will be able to do-nate \"distressed\" foods to local gov-ernments or to the state, under anew law effective Aug. 1, 1998. Food is considered distressed when it cannot legally be sold but is still deemed safe \u2014 unspoiled milk that hasnot sold before the expiration date, forexample. Currently, food handlers can donate dis- tressed foods to nonprofit organizations whosupply the food to the elderly or needy. Thenew law will allow them to donate these foodsto units of government. The measure, signed by the Gov. Arne Carlson March 25, will remove liability forfood handlers who choose to donate the dis-tressed food, except in instances of gross neg-ligence or intentional misconduct. Bill sponsor Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) said that the idea was brought toher by county commissioners who felt that itwould be a good way to defray correctionscosts. \"It's food that may not be marketable, but it is still safe for consumption,\" Harder said. Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored the bill in the Senate.

Seventy-five members of the House have signed a petition stating they wouldn't votefor the $56 million omnibus bill if it returnedto the floor without the abortion language. The version of the omnibus bill earlier ap- proved by the House included the ban on late-term abortions. The Senate version of the billhad no abortion reference. The conference committee deadlocked 5-5 on a vote that would have included in the billa provision banning partial-birth abortionsand making it a felony offense for anyone toperform such a procedure. The measure wouldhave allowed the procedure only if it wereperformed to save the mother's life. More than half the states have either passed bills or injunctions against partial-birthabortions. The conference committee also debated a portion of the House bill that would requireclinics and doctors to complete extensive formsto report abortions. Those provisions are stillpending a vote of conference committeemembers. The omnibus bill also carries provisions for welfare reform, efforts to address the problem Supporters from both sides of the abortion debate brought their signs to the hallway outside the Housechamber April 1. Later, the health and human services conference committee removed from a bill aprovision that would have legally limited so-called partial-birth abortion procedures.of fetal alcohol syndrome, and various otherhuman services initiatives, including foodstamps for 8,000 to 10,000 legal immigrantsand pay raises for nursing home workers. The House bill is sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls). Improper use of DEA numbers The U.S. Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration (DEA) uses a num-bering system that was establishedto identify medical professionalsand others who are authorized toengage in business activities involv- ing controlled substances. But the insurance industry and health plan companies have sometimes used DEA num-bers for other purposes, such as tracking thedrug prescription practices of health careproviders. That will no longer be allowed under a law signed March 23, which will not take effect forat least two years. Its effective date is 24 monthsafter a unique, alternative health identifier isadopted. The identifier would be adopted under the federal legislation dealing with health insur-ance portability and accountability. The sta-tus of that identifier is pending. The DEA has tried to get national health insurance associations to find an alternativeto the industry use of DEA numbers and hasasked its registrants to refuse to furnish DEAnumbers to insurance providers for reimburse-ment purposes. The DEA claims misuse couldSigned by the governor12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998INDUSTRYweaken the registration system, and the agency has sought to restrict the registration numbersto use for drug enforcement purposes. The new state law will limit the use of DEA numbers for law enforcement purposes, andthus prohibit insurance providers or healthplan companies from monitoring the pre-scribing practices of a practitioner. The law also stipulates a prescription that is not a controlled substance does not have tobear a DEA number. Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon-sored the measure. HF2401/SF2207*/CH316 New area codes A last-ditch effort to keep St. Paul from losing its 612 telephone area code seems tohave stalled. After hearing testimony March 31 from Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Chair Ed-ward Garvey before the House Regulated In-dustries and Energy Committee, Rep. MichaelPaymar (DFL-St. Paul) said he would discussthe issue with his St. Paul colleagues, but heessentially conceded the matter was over. \"My position is that the decisions are made,\" Paymar said. \"I do not think this will be help-ful for St. Paul. I'm not satisfied, but therecomes a time when you have to see the writingon the wall and throw in the towel.\" Paymar's aim is to keep the 612 area code for the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Hewants the new 651 area code to go to theoutlying suburbs. Paymar said St. Paul businesses would in- cur considerable cost in making the changeand all government-related numbers in St.Paul would be involved as well. Shortly before the March 31 House com- mittee meeting, the PUC voted unanimouslyto stick with its plan to split the area code inthe metropolitan area along municipal bound-aries. The hearing on Paymar's bill ( HF3191 ) marked the second time in less than a monthhe had tried to halt the PUC's planned July1998 switch of St. Paul and other eastern met-ropolitan area cities to a new 651 area code. Paymar earlier tried to amend separate leg- islation on the House floor to include lan-guage that would halt the change. Thatamendment failed. Frontier Communications officials have also protested the change because about 5,000 ofits customers in the southern suburbs of AppleValley and Lakeville will be assigned entirelynew telephone numbers because of technical issues. Frontier officials say switching the custom- ers to new phone numbers is inconvenientand costly and that the software the companywill require in the change is untried. Some legislators have questioned why cer- tain alternatives couldn't be sought, but Garveyexplained a new area code is inevitable and ageographic split by municipal boundaries wasthe best solution. The option preferred by U.S. West and by Garvey was for all existing numbers to remainthe same, with new numbers assigned the 651area code. But that would mean all numbersdialed in the metropolitan area would be 10-digit numbers. Also, a residence or businesscould have both 612 and 651 area codes. Other legislators wondered why cellular phones, pagers, and fax machines could not beassigned the new area code. Garvey explainedthe Federal Communications Commission(FCC) forbids that. The FCC has decided it isdiscriminatory to give new area codes to justone set of telecommunications providers. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) said that prefixes are assigned in blocks of 10,000and asked why unused prefixes allotted to anexchange or company can't be distributedelsewhere. Garvey said current technology doesnot allow this, although it is expected to bepossible in the future. Garvey said the PUC decided after seven public meetings to go with a geographic split.One option under that plan was to give eitherMinneapolis or St. Paul a new area code. Theother option was to give the suburbs ringingthe two cities a new area code and keep Min-neapolis and St. Paul in the 612 area. Thatwould have been in line with Paymar's bill. But PUC projections suggested the outer ring of cities would exhaust all its numbers nolater than 2003, and the inner ring in mid-2007. Garvey said history indicates the num-bers would be exhausted before then. In addition, Garvey said the PUC currently believes it will have to add a 952 area code inthe western suburbs around 2001. Regardlessof the plan, he said two new area codes will beneeded in the metropolitan area within thenext few years. Garvey said the PUC decided to give the east side of the metropolitan area the new areacode this summer because it will inconve-nience fewer people because that side has fewerresidents. But, more importantly, the PUCdid not want some people to be forced tochange area codes twice in a short period oftime, he said. Because the PUC knows some portion of western metropolitan area customers will needthe 952 area code, if the west side were as-signed the new area code some western cus- tomers would have to change to the 651 codethis summer, then to 952 within three or fouryears. If St. Paul and the eastern suburbs get a new area code now, no customer will have to changeagain in the foreseeable future, he said. The new area codes are effective July 12, 1998, with \"permissive dialing\" until Jan. 10,1999. Permissive dialing means a call betweenthe old 612 area code and the new 651 areacode will connect even if seven rather than 10numbers are dialed. The permissive dialingperiod allows customers to get used to thechange. The committee took no action on the bill. Electric industry study The House passed a bill March 30 that would direct the existing Legislative Electric EnergyTask Force to complete a comprehensive studyof certain aspects of the electric industry. Thevote was 117-9. HF3654 , sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), would require the task force tostudy potential benefits and costs of restruc-turing the electric industry to rural, low-in-come, residential, small business, andcommercial and industrial energy consumers. The study would include the ability of these consumers to participate in and benefit fromrestructuring. The task force also would ex-amine various issues such as safety and main-tenance concerns and would analyze laws andregulations that could prevent Minnesota utili-ties from competing fairly in an open market. The Legislative Electric Energy Task Force consists of 10 House members and 10 Senatemembers. It currently analyzes issues relatingto the deregulation of the electric industry andmakes recommendations to the Legislature. The bill would stipulate that while conduct- ing the review and analysis of restructuring,the task force would have to consult withaffected and interested parties. The Clinton administration, in March, un- veiled a proposal to bring competition andconsumer choice to the electric industry. Among other directives, the Clinton pro- posal would require states to decide by Jan. 1,2003, if they would open retail service to com-petition, require utilities to disclose informa-tion on a standard consumer label, and providematching funds to states for low-income as-sistance, energy efficiency programs, and useof renewable energy sources. The Clinton administration claims its pro- posal would save American consumers $20billion a year and reduce greenhouse gasemissions.13 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBut there are concerns. One is that unless the average consumer is consulted and has achance to voice an opinion, industrial userswill reap the benefits of deregulation and smallelectric customers could possibly wind up sub-sidizing the cost of the effort. Some believe the Clinton proposal will help protect the environment and help low-in-come customers but that too much authoritywill be concentrated at the federal level. Jennings said on the House floor that if the states don't address restructuring issues, thefederal government will do it for them. The bill now goes to the Senate. Asking for action Allyson Hartle, a lobbyist for the Special Transportation Services Association, studies thenames of agencies and organizations written on a petition set up outside the House ChamberApril 2. The petition is an attempt to convince members of the Legislature to pass an omnibushealth and human services spending bill, regardless of a controversy over abortion-relatedprovisions.METRO AFFAIRS TAXESProtecting telephone customers A measure designed to protect Min-nesota telephone customers fromunauthorized switching of long-distance telephone carriers wassigned into law March 31. \"While most long-distance pro- viders conduct their business in an ethical,above-board fashion, there are some that un-fortunately do not,\" Gov. Arne Carlson said ina news release. \"In signing this legislation, weare now able to give Minnesotans protectionfrom unscrupulous carriers.\" A new provision, effective July 1, 1998, will require long-distance providers to give price information on specific calling patterns toconsumers and will forbid the providers fromthe practice of \"slamming,\" or switching cus-tomers without their knowledge. The long-distance providers will have to provide proof that a customer authorized achange in carriers. If the provider is unable toproduce a written statement or a tape record-ing indicating the customer authorized thechange, the carrier will have to pay the cost ofreturning the customer to the original serviceand the cost of any of the customer's long-distance calls during the unauthorized period. Long-distance companies also will have to provide upon request \u2014 or when solicitingcustomers \u2014 information on the price rangeof services, minimum volume requirements,termination charges, and other fees. A separate provision effective April 1, 1998, provides an exemption to requirements ofbiomass-fueled power plants. Examples of bio-mass power sources are sawdust or wood chips,agricultural residues, and the organic portionof the solid waste stream. Previous law provided that biomass-fueled power plants can use non-biomass fuels for upto 25 percent of their fuel. The new law pro-vides an expansion so that when biomass fuelsources are not reasonably available to thefacility because flood, fire, drought, disease orother acts of God, the power facility can ex-ceed the exemption without penalty or a charge against its normal 25 percent exemption. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) spon-sored the legislation. HF3042*/SF2797/CH345 Met Council 'service redesign' The Metropolitan Council would carry out a plan known as \"service redesign\" to reduceits costs, under a bill the House passedMarch 30. The vote was 82-43. The bill, which would set up a pilot project, was initiated by the Metropolitan Council toallow it to sell some of its services to either theprivate or public sector to generate revenue. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), would require the council,when performing services such as wastewatertreatment, to develop plans in which perfor-mance and cost can be measured objectively.The plan would be effective in the seven-county metropolitan area. The council could improve efficiency of its operations for a particular project by sellingthe capacity to another government entity ora service provider in the private sector. The Metropolitan Council was created in 1967 and is responsible for regional planningin the Twin Cities metropolitan area. It's oneof the largest regional governments in the country and oversees the regional bus system,wastewater treatment facilities, and MetroMobility, a transit operation that serves dis-abled people. An amendment relating to airport projects and offered by Rep. Geri Evans (DFL-NewBrighton) was approved on the floor. It wouldrequire that the council review proposed air-port projects and not approve them unless thecouncil sees that the Metropolitan AirportsCommission has given the nearby communi-ties a chance to discuss and participate exten-sively in the decision-making process.

Property tax rebate Effective March 19, 1998, a new state law ensures homeowners whoprepaid their 1997 property taxescan claim a rebate allowed under alaw passed last year.The 1997 Legislature, flush with a projected $2.3 billion budget surplus, passed aone-time tax rebate to give some of that sur-plus back to homeowners and renters. Therebate was linked to property taxes paid in1997. However, that created a problem for thoseSigned by the governor Signed by the governor14 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998who paid their 1997 property taxes before Jan. 1, 1997. Homeowners sometimes pre-pay theirtaxes to claim an itemized deduction for theprevious year's income tax. Under the 1997 law, people who prepaid were out of luck, because the measure limitedpayment of the rebate to those who paid theirproperty taxes in 1997. The new law allows the property tax rebate tobe paid to all taxpayers who paid their 1997property taxes before Jan. 1, 1998. The rebate is available to both homeowners and renters. For homeowners, it comes to 20percent of their property taxes, and for rent-ers, 3.6 percent of their rent paid. Althoughthe rebate is a property tax rebate, it is claimedon the state income tax returns filed this year.The rebate is separate from the regular prop-erty tax refund that many renters andhomeowners get in August of each year. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Dou- glas Johnson (DFL-Tower) sponsored the newmeasure.

This is a bill whosetime has come.\" Folliard also said thatthe bill would use technology to sim-plify the process. We regret the error.TRANSPORTATION Omnibus transportation bill There would be fewer new state troopers on the road than the governor requested underthe $51 million omnibus transportation andtransit bill that won final passage in the HouseApril 2. The vote was 119-9. However, conference committee members did find a compromise in funding for addi-tional staff for the state patrol. The bill wouldappropriate $2.7 million for 29 new troopersand add $200,000 for additional state patrolhelicopter flight time to enhance law enforce-ment efforts. The governor had requested 47 additional state troopers at a cost of $5.25 million. Maj. Gene Halverson, of the state patrol, told conference committee members that lo-cal television stations have more helicoptersthan Minnesota law enforcement agencies.He said that's difficult to understand when\"there is no greater advantage we get whenthose helicopters come and light up the scene.\" The state patrol flies its helicopter patrols only on Friday and Saturday nights to supportofficers on duty. \"But if I had my druthers,\"Halverson said, \"we'd fly every night.\" Halverson said the helicopters have heat- sensing devices that not only help in criminalmatters but also have located missing people.One flight in northern Minnesota even savedthe lives of some snowmobilers. Another 29 state troopers would bring the allowable full-funded complement to 564.Currently, there are 488 state troopers on the road in Minnesota and another 39 in training. In 1996, the governor sought funds to hire 46 additional troopers, but only four addi-tional state patrol dispatchers were hired. Even with the additional funds for flights, about $1.5 million was shaved from the origi-nal House state patrol funding request. Theoriginal House bill called for an overall appro-priation of $52.5 million and the Senate billcalled for $45 million. The final bill includes $40 million that would be appropriated from the state trunk highwayfund for road construction in fiscal 1999. A Senate provision that would allow prepa- ration for light rail transit also made its wayinto the final bill. The provision would establish an 11-mem- ber planning board for the Lake Street corri-dor in Minneapolis from the western city limitsto the Mississippi River. The board wouldplan and coordinate economic development,transportation, and residential renewal in con-junction with affected neighborhood, govern-ment, and business entities. The bill ( HF3057/SF3298* ), sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), nowgoes to the governor. Making vehicles available Nonprofit organizations that sellor lease inexpensive cars no longerneed to apply for a motor vehicledealer's license, under a new lawthat took effect March 17. Certain charitable organizations repair and recondition older vehicles that aredonated to them. These groups then sell thevehicles at low prices to people moving offpublic assistance or to other low-incomepeople. The new law exempts these organization from needing a dealer's license. Under the law, the cash value of the vehicle being sold must be less than $1,000 and theorganization must meet the requirements of anonprofit charitable group under the tax codeto get the exemption. The law could make more vehicles available for people at a time when welfare recipientsare being encouraged to find employmentunder welfare reform measures that took ef-fect in 1997. Many of these people do not havetransportation, according to Rep. TimPawlenty (R-Eagan), who sponsored the mea-sure in the House. Sen.

Ward Briggs, of the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the hazardous wastetransportation industry objected to the re-quirement, calling it a nuisance. He also saidthe background check involving fingerprintshad been part of a national pilot program thathad expired. Briggs said the fingerprint checks were not proven to be the best method of evaluating thebackground of those involved with theintrastate transport of hazardous waste. Hesaid some with a criminal record were slippingby despite the checks. Briggs said other methods of accomplishing better background checks are currently understudy, and a national system for such a processis expected soon. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) and Sen.

Call the Chief Clerks Office at (612) 296-231415 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Sandy Donovan When former House member John Pillsbury Snyder died in 1959, his obituary touted thefact that he had bowled a perfect 300 game atthe Minneapolis Athletic Club in 1942. The obituary, which made the front page of the Minneapolis Morning Tribune , also praised Snyder for his successful automobile businessand his leadership of several mining corpora-tions and noted that he was the grandson offormer Minnesota Gov. John Sargent Pillsbury. It was not until near the end of the article that a 1912 event that had put Snyder on thefront page of newspapers around the countrywas mentioned. In April of that year, he andhis wife, Nelle, were among the 705 survivorsof the Titanic disaster. The newly married couple had honey- mooned in Europe in early 1912, travelingmostly through Italy to study how Fiats weremade. Snyder's luxury-car dealership, SnyderGarage Inc. of 407 S. 10th St. in Minneapolis,was just beginning to sell the new brand ofItalian cars. For their return trip, the Snyders booked a first-class stateroom on the maiden voyage ofthe luxury liner Titanic. Those exclusive cab-ins cost up to $5,000 for the six-day trip. Nelle Snyder, who was only 20 at the time, later told reporters that she had been reluctant totravel on the highly touted but untested Titanic. Soon after boarding the ship April 10, Snyder must have sat down to write a thank-you noteto a London cigar merchant. His correspon-dence, on Titanic stationery, was among thefew surviving letters from the doomed voyage.It was handed overboard at the dock beforethe ship sailed. Today Snyder's grandson, Stevenson Miller, of Montana, owns the letter. He told the Minne-apolis Star Tribune that he received it along with \"a bunch of stuff nobody in the family wanted.\"Titanic survivors . . . Local man, saved from disaster, serves term in House dren \u2014 Snyder's accounts stressed that fewpeople wanted to get in the lifeboats and thathe was practically shoved into the first one tobe lowered from the sinking liner. \"Somebody . . . called out that families should keep together in getting into the boats,\"he told the Minneapolis Journal . \"The people were reluctant to get into the boats at first.Those in front stepped back. \"Some of them looked over the side of the vessel into the darkness of the night and wereloath to trust themselves to the frail-lookingboats swinging on the davits.\" Snyder also said that people were calling for brides and grooms to get in the first boat. \"When the crowd in front turned aside, my wife and I were left at the front,\" he said. \"Thefirst thing we knew we were both assisted intothe lifeboat. At that time there were not manymen or women on the deck ready to go intothe lifeboats. \"Those that did get into the boats felt that it was merely a measure of precaution \u2014 thatthey would be able to return to the ship withina couple of hours at the outside, when what-ever damage that had been done had beenremedied.\" Snyder's version of events is likely close to the truth. When his lifeboat was lowered atabout 12:45 a.m. it contained only 28 people,although it could have carried 65. After aboutfive hours at sea in the leaking lifeboat \u2014 NelleSnyder reported that she used her hat to bailout water \u2014 they were rescued by theCarpathia, the first ship to answer the Titanic'sdistress calls. But whatever the circumstances, Snyder undoubtedly felt somewhat sheepish after sur-viving the tragedy. Following initial conversa-tions with the press, neither of the Snydersdiscussed their rescue for several decades. Upon landing in New York, they checked into a hotel, contacted family, and returnedsoon to Minneapolis. Once home they settledinto Minneapolis society, had three children,and watched Snyder Garage flourish. DuringWorld War I Snyder served as a major in theinfantry. When he was elected to the House in 1926, Snyder was following family footsteps intopublic life. Not only had his maternal grand-father been governor, his father had also servedin the House for one term in 1897-98. Snyder represented part of Minneapolis in the state's 34th district and served on six Housecommittees: civil administration, motor ve- Three days after he wrote that letter, Snyder and his wife were walking along one of theliner's upper decks, about to return to theirstateroom for the night, when they felt a crash.They later said they were told that there was nodanger, and they retired to their cabin. Itwould have been just before midnight,April 13. Within a few minutes, the Snyders later said, a steward knocked on their door and toldthem they should get up on deck. Snyder saidthere was general concern but not panic, andhis wife, complaining of the cold, went back tothe cabin to get warmer clothing and herjewelry box. Snyder said the crew was by then telling people to get in the lifeboats, but most wereresisting. \"The women, after looking over the rail into the water, refused to change their seeming safeposition for the more precarious one in alifeboat,\" he told reporters. \"An officer pleaded,then ordered them into the boat.

July 27, 1998, marks the 100th anniversary of the laying of the Capitol cornerstone. The 1898 cornerstone laying ceremony was a grand event with plenty of pomp and circumstance (and long-winded orators), according to Laying of the Corner Stone of the New Capitol of Minnesota, a commemorative book published by the Pioneer Press Co. in 1898.100th anniversary . . . Historians to celebrate laying of Capitol cornerstone The festivities began with a parade through St. Paul, complete with marching bands, mountedpolice, and a 36-by-20 American flag handled by18 men from the Fifteenth Minnesota Infantry. Several carriages carried government offi- cials and dignitaries, including U.S. Sens.Knute Nelson and Cushman K. Davis, Arch-bishop John Ireland, Capitol architect CassGilbert, and Mr. and Mrs. A.L. Larpenteur,who had originally homesteaded the land uponwhich the Capitol was constructed. While the band played \"Stars and Stripes,\" several thousand invited guests and citizensgathered on the Capitol lawn. It was a day to marvel at how far the state had come since 1849 when, in the words ofDavis, \"[t]here were no courts, no legislature,no executive, and it was doubtful if there wereany laws. . . . Minnesota was a political derelictupon the sea of Time.\" The population had grown from 4,940 in 1849, the year the Minnesota Territory wasorganized, to nearly 1.6 million in the 1895census. Alexander Ramsey, first governor of theThe cornerstone is inlaid with a sealed cop- per box containing many significant historicaldocuments and objects. The articles include: a Bible; a Minnesota Historical Society publication titled \"HowMinnesota Became a State\"; a two-volume setof Minnesota Statutes; a book titled History of Minnesota Volunteers in the War of Rebellion;portraits of Ramsey and Henry Sibley,Minnesota's first governor; photographs ofMinneapolis and other Minnesota cities; cop-per plate etchings of the Capitol floor plans;and copies of the St. Paul and Minneapolisnewspapers. \"Minnesota has been last of all her sisters of the West in building a statehouse commensu-rate with the dignity and suitable to the uses ofa great state,\" said C.H. Graves of Duluth, amember of the State Capitol Commission.\"May this building be the birthplace of wiselaws, enacted by honest and incorruptible leg-islators, interpreted by a fearless and learnedcourt, and administered by loyal officers ofthe state.\" The Minnesota Historical Society will host a celebration in honor of the cornerstone cen-tennial on Saturday, July 25, 1998, at 1 p.m. inthe Capitol rotunda. Visitors will witness a re-enactment of a portion of the ceremony. Also,objects similar to those sealed within the cor-nerstone will be displayed. Minnesota Territory and second governor ofthe state of Minnesota, was chosen to set thecornerstone in place. \"The corner stone has always conveyed a mystical and symbolic meaning, even in di-vine utterances,\" Davis said. \"The hand thatlaid the ideal foundation of this state 50 yearsago, in the dining room of a frontier tavern,now lays the corner stone of this, the capitol ofthe completed commonwealth.\" Ramsey was presented with a silver trowel adorned with a border of moccasin flowers.The trowel's handle was made of tamarackwood from the old Central House, a hotel thathosted the first Territorial Legislature andserved as the unofficial Capitol in 1849. In acknowledging the gift, Ramsey demon- strated a sense of humor previously absentfrom the day's speeches. \"[The trowel has] relieved me of serious embarrassment, for, being new to such func-tions, I had neglected to provide myself withthe necessary implements and have been some-what perplexed as to how I should performthem,\" Ramsey said.

Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) said in a recent interview that shelearned valuable political lessonsfrom the good sisters of the St.Stephen's Convent in South Minneapolis. \"The nuns were activists,\" she said.Long said that she had been volunteering in the civil rights and antiwar movements yearsago and felt she should attend her precinctcaucus, which happened to be at St. Stephen'sChurch. \"The nuns took my hand and said, 'Would you like to be a delegate?' I said, 'Yeah, how doI get in?' And they said, 'Well, we'll help you.'So, I guess, I really learned my grass rootspolitical involvement from the St. Stephen'sConvent nuns,\" Long said. In fact, the nuns completed a long political education that began with her politically ac-tive parents, Long said. \"I was raised with the thought that you owe something to your community and to societyas a whole,\" she said. \"You have an obligationto try to leave things better when you leave thisplace.\" Long's father was very involved in politics and would take her to both parties' headquar-ters on election night to watch the returns.Long recalls being introduced to people fromboth sides of the aisle who were very passion-ate about their political involvement. \"I was left with the impression that politics was something that was an appropriate in-volvement and fun,\" she said. Elected to the House in 1978, Long an- nounced this year that she will be leaving theLegislature to run for secretary of state. \"I have spent 20 years in this position,\" she said. \"I think sometimes you just feel it's timeto move on and, intuitively, now is the time.\" Long said she is excited about the possibility of tackling the secretary of state job. She seesthe job as key to securing public participationin the political process. \"I have been concerned for a number of years about the sense of disengagement frompublic life and community in general,\" shesaid. \"We need to get back to more of a feelingthat we are a part of a neighborhood or acommunity \u2014 part of a city or a town. Thatwas one of the things that inspired me to runfor [the secretary of state] office.\"Rep. Dee Long . . . Ten-term legislator seeks secretary of state position In many ways, Long's legislative career il- lustrates the advances made by women inpolitics. Long was the first woman to chair theHouse Taxes Committee and the secondwoman elected as DFL majority leader. In1993, she became the first woman electedspeaker of the House. Long said that women tend to bring a differ- ent and valuable perspective to lawmaking. \"I do think women bring somewhat differ- ent experiences,\" she said. \"And I do thinkwomen's style of leadership can be somewhatdifferent. I think women don't, as much, needthe feeling that they have personal power.They tend to be much more conciliatory.\" Long said women have brought important issues to the table, including child care andchild support. She said that these concerns arenow much more prevalent in society. \"I have noticed a difference in the younger male members \u2014 the greater appreciation ofthe role of working wives and mothers,\" shesaid. Long resigned the speaker position in the fall of 1993 amid criticism of her response tothe \"phonegate\" controversy.\"I certainly could have handled the situa- tion better,\" she said. \"I learned a lot frommistakes that were made.\" Since 1993, Long has mounted what politi- cal insiders have been calling a major come-back. She was named chair of the House LocalGovernment and Metropolitan Affairs Com-mittee in 1995. In 1997, she regained the chair of the powerful Taxes Committee, and she hasbeen spending a good deal of her time workingon tax issues. However, for Long, other legislative accom- plishments stand out. \"What I feel best about is the environmental legislation,\" she said. \"That will make a differ-ence 50 or 100 years from now. Changes in taxlaw are interesting to work on, but I don'tthink that they have that same durability.\" Long said that she will miss the times when legislators can rise above differences in partyand local interests. \"What I will remember with great fondness are the times when you have members fromboth parties working together to accomplishsome real policy goals,\" she said. \"That, to me,is the Legislature at its best.\" Veteran legislator Rep. Dee Long has seen many changes since she was elected to the House in 1978.She's hoping to take what she has learned into her campaign for secretary of state.20 SESSION WEEKLY / April 3, 1998By Matt Wetzel Walk down a hallway in the State Office Building during the legislative sessionand chances are you'll see several well- dressed lobbyists talking into thin, flat devicesseemingly attached to the sides of their heads.Cellular phones, no less. Ten years ago, they might have been lined up at the pay telephones, awaiting their turn. When a legislator returns to St. Paul after a long weekend, he or she might have more than200 e-mail messages waiting to be read. Orthat person might have 20 voice-mail mes-sages waiting to be heard. Lawmakers have the option of returning those messages by e-mail, which is available tothem on the laptop computers issued to allHouse members. Legislators and their constituents also can go on the Internet and look up any bill or billsummary, and during a floor session, allamendments offered that day. Technology has made its mark on the legis- lative process, and most legislators and lobby-ists agree it has improved it. But somelegislators caution that the people who don'thave personal computers with Internet accessshouldn't be forgotten. Tom Newcome, who served in the House from 1965 to 1975 representing the WhiteBear Lake area, said he had seen many changesat the Capitol in those years. Since then, he'sbeen a lobbyist, now with the firm of Leonard,O'Brien, Wilford, Spencer and Gale Ltd. of St.Paul. \"I do think [the process is] better in the respect that everybody has the information tomake a decision,\" Newcome said. Sarah Janecek of the firm Spano & Janecek agreed. \"With all the technology we have tomake the information available instanta-neously, I think it's great,\" she said. Newcome recalled serving on a conference committee in the early 1970s before technol-ogy and other forces made the process moreopen and accessible. \"We went out to the governor's mansion for two weeks. It was like electing the pope. Wecame out and announced we'd made our de-cision,\" he said. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) agreed that technological advanceshave improved the legislative process for mem-bers of the public. \"I think whenever you can get more infor- mation it's better,\" he said. \"We're accessibleto Pinstripes 'n cell phones . . . Technology has positive impact on legislative process He finds the laptop computer regularly situ- ated on his desk in the chamber convenient.Instead of sending an aide to get a copy of a billhe needs, Sviggum can use the computer to lookit up or to find out almost anything else he wantsto know about the Legislature on the House'sweb site (www.house.leg.state.mn.us). Technology \"makes communication a lot easier,\" said Jack Horner, a lobbyist with theMinnesota Multi-Housing Association. Horner says he still gets his information, particularly on bills, the old-fashioned way,by attending committee meetings and goingto the Chief Clerk's Office. But he said he hasoccasionally \"pulled them off the Internet.\" He agrees that the information explosion has improved voters' access to their legisla-tors, and that's apparent when there is an issuethat's commanding public attention. Legisla-tors are often besieged by e-mails, voice-mailsand faxes. \"The first thing I'm afraid of is an expecta-tion of a response to every inquiry,\" said Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul), adding thathe received 497 e-mail messages over theChristmas holidays. \"They're expecting they'll get a response from everyone they wrote to. It doesn't makesense,\" he said. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), who is in his 10th year as a legislator, said he regularlyreceives 20 to 30 daily messages on his voice-mail. \"I return the calls if they're in my district,\" he said. \"It makes us keep in touch with thepublic, which has been good.\" Pugh, who has been in the Legislature since 1989, said having the laptop is convenient tocheck e-mail and to check on bills and amend-ments. \"This way, it's just a couple punches of the key. You can read the whole bill,\" he said. Lea Schuster, a consumer and economic rights advocate for the Minnesota Public In-terest Research Group, said she believes tech-nology has improved accountability in thelawmaking process. \"I'd say it's changed generally for the bet- ter,\" she said. Her organization's charge is that of a citizen's group working for social change on consumerrights and land use. Schuster said a problemwith technological changes is that some peopleare left behind. There are a lot of low-income people who don't have access to the Internet that rely onthe old-fashioned methods to communicatewith their legislators, and the Legislatureshould work to accommodate them, she said. As for those cellular phones, some refuse to use them and others say they couldn't getalong without them. Newcome said he doeskeep a cellular phone in his briefcase, but herarely uses it. Janecek said she does have one and thinks it's great. \"You don't have to have quarters,\" she joked.Horner said he doesn't have one, just be- cause he hasn't felt the need for one. But heacknowledged that he does use a pager. Sviggum is a veteran of cellular phone use, using one for three and-a-half years. \"It just makes it a much more convenient use of my time,\" he said. \"I spend a lot of timeon the road.\" He often uses that time to return telephone calls. And, if something happens to his car onthe way, he can call for help. Cellular phones have replaced pay phones as thecommunication mode of choice for lobbyists andlawmakers during session.21 April 3, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYTracking the Bills . . . March 27 - April 2, 1998 CH338-CH353 HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFOnce a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sentto the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when consid-ering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within anappropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differenteffects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsBills await governor's action and files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required. But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sinedie\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a datecertain\"). If the governor does not sign a billwithin this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto.\" Thegovernor is not required to provide a reasonfor the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he or sheobjects. As with all vetoes (save pocket ve-toes) the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the veto with the re-turned bill. Here, too, the timetable is either14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, orwithin three days after the governor receivesthe bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota constitution (Article IV,Section 23). Internet access to this information is available 3406 U.S. memorialized to resolve differences between province of Ontario and the state of Minnesota regarding Canadian waters and the taking of fish.

She is one of those rare individuals one cannot help but respect and care about. After 20 years of dedicated service to the House in many responsibilities,she steps down as 2nd assistant chief clerk to go to work in the private sector. When her departure was announced on the House floor during session on April 7, the members were startled. With a loud gasp expressing astonishment, then regret, they stoodand gave Teresa and Charlie Ward, the other staff member leaving, one of the longestovations heard in the chamber in years. An informal duty during her tenure was to serve as a \"pacifier\" for first-termers who always started out being confused by the process. Teresa's duties included serving as theofficial liaison for chaplains who come to give the invocation. \"I will miss her,\" said House Chaplain Rev. Ronald A. Smith. \"The chamber can be intimidating, but Teresa made you feel at home with her perennial smile. She also helpedyou understand the process.\" Teresa's work in public service did not begin with her stint as the intern for former Rep. John Brandl (DFL-Mpls) in 1978. As long as she can remember, \"public service in my family was as automatic as brushing your teeth,\" she said. Her grandfather, Leonard Keyes, was a district judge in Anoka for 35 years. Her deceased father, Gerald Kittridge, worked 35 years for the State Highway Patrol and later was alobbyist for the Minnesota Peace and Police Officers Association. \"But the real politician was my grandmother, Cecilia Keyes. She instilled a dedication to public service in us,\" said Teresa. \"She was a DFL associate chair and a close friend ofHubert H. Humphrey.\" All the Kittridge siblings work in the public sector. Sister Colleen Landkamer is a commissioner for Blue Earth County. Brother Kevin is former chief of the State HighwayPatrol. He now is a district commander. Teresa's other brother, Patrick, is a RamseyCounty public defender. Their mother, Martha Keyes Kittridge, although retired morethan once, does chemical dependency and gambling assessments for Ramsey County. Darlene Keran, DFL supervisor of administrative support staff, said, \"Over the years, Teresa's communications and negotiating skills have been a major asset in support of staffin both caucuses.\" Chief Clerk Ed Burdick finds it very difficult to think of not having Teresa around. Since 1987, he has served as her mentor and good friend. For Teresa, it has been a privilege andhonor to have worked for the Legislature and Mr. Burdick. \"The most difficult part about leaving, she said, \"is to know that I will no longer be working with him, [1st Assistant Clerk] Al Mathiowetz, and the other main desk and clerk'sstaff.

The tax compromise, reached April 8, includes another$500 million in property tax rebates for homeowners and renters next year and permanent property taxcuts for businesses and apartment owners.By Nick Healy Major legislative initiatives won approval in the waning hours of the legislativesession April 9, as Gov. Arne Carlson's record veto total continued to swell during hisfinal year in office. After weeks of often-difficult conference committee negotiations, major bills related totaxes, state building projects, and K-12 educa-tion emerged for action on the House floor. Emergency relief for tornado victims sped to passage, but several major spending bills \u2014including human services, economic devel-opment, and early childhood education mea-sures \u2014 ran into rough times. The House passed an omnibus tax bill that would provide $500 million in property taxrebates for homeowners and renters and wouldmake reforms in the property tax system. \"We've worked long and hard,\" said Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), chair of the HouseTaxes Committee. \"This bill is the result ofcompromises on both sides.\" Long and her Senate counterpart, Sen. Doug Johnson (DFL-Tower), demonstrated an un-usual level of camaraderie when they wrappedup conference committee work on the tax billwith a friendly little kiss \u2014 just a peck for thecameras. All lawmakers did not respond so warmly to the bill produced by the conference commit-tee Long and Johnson led. Opposition to themeasure came from legislators who called formore of the state's projected $1.9 billion sur-plus to be returned to taxpayers. Critics werenot satisfied with the proposed $500 millionin rebates. \"It's not enough. It's $500 million out of $1.9 billion,\" said Rep. H. Todd Van Dellen(R-Plymouth). \"There's no permanent tax cutthat you permanently give back to taxpayers.It's very reasonable for us to expect that tax-payers have a permanent tax cut.\" But supporters said the bill would provide sizable rebates and significant reform, andLong defended the tax plan. \"If you knew what was in the bill, you couldn't make the statements you continue tomake. There are permanent property tax cutsfor all Minnesota businesses and apartmentowners in the bill,\" she said. The House also passed a $124 million K-12 funding bill on the session's final day. TheOn the last day . . . Major initiatives win approval; some hit rough waters vote was 105-28. The bill would allow schooldistricts to phase in the Profile of Learning, aportion of the state's Graduation Standardsinitiative that would measure student achieve-ment on a broad range of skills in many sub-ject areas. The Profile of Learning is currently set to be implemented statewide in the 1998-1999school year, but the bill would allow districtsup to three years to fully implement the newrequirements. The bill would provide $70 million to help districts implement the Profile of Learning.Funds could be used to update curriculumand to train teachers to work with the newrequirements. The bill also includes a provision that would abolish the State Board of Education, a nine-member board that sets a limited range ofpolicies and regulations for K-12 educationand community education. The close of the legislative session also saw a break in the standoff over an omnibus bond-ing bill that was the subject of great contro-versy related to funding for a new St. Paularena to house the Minnesota Wild profes-sional hockey team. The bonding bill, which would provide for nearly $1 billion in capital projects, emergedfrom conference committee including a plan that would provide a $65 million interest-freeloan from the state to the city that wouldsupport construction of the $130 million St.Paul arena. The bonding bill also includesfunds for expansion of the Minneapolis Con-vention Center and for convention and com-munity center projects in cities includingDuluth and St. Cloud. The House passed the bill late April 9. The vote was 86-47. The emergency tornado relief bill quickly assembled and passed before the close of thesession would provide $27.6 million to helpresidents and businesses in south-centralMinnesota towns struck by a recent storm. \"The power that comes from hope is very well represented in this package,\" said Rep.Ruth Johnson (DFL-St. Peter), who spon-sored the bill. Johnson's home was among the 1,000 in St. Peter to receive minor damage in the March29 storm. Another 200 homes were destroyed,and 600 others in the historic MinnesotaRiver town had major damage. The state funds would provide the state and local matching contributions required to re-ceive federal aid for the four Minnesota coun-ties declared a major disaster area. And the4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998By Nicole Wood The clock is ticking on the 80th Legisla- tive Session and former Rep. Mary Forsythesends her condolences from Sun City, Ariz.,to her old colleagues in St. Paul. \"I feel sorry for them,\" she said during a recent telephone interview. \"They're prob-ably working until two in the morning. \"That was one thing I got out of the Legislature \u2014 I don't even get jet lag whenI go to Europe because I'm used to being upall night.\" Forsythe, a Republican, served District 42B in Edina from 1972 to 1990. She was thefirst woman elected to the Legislature fromher district and the firstwoman to chair the HouseAppropriations Committee. \"I always said [Edina] was the best town in the state,\"she said. \"I had a lot of peoplewho cared and a lot of well-educated people with an in-terest in politics.\" Plus, she said, it was a town full of Republicans, so she fitright in. \"The most outstanding thing about Mary, other thanher intellect, was that she hadthis wonderful voice,\" saidfriend and former Rep. SidneyPauly, who served a districtbordering Forsythe's in the 1980s. \"She wasa music major at St. Olaf and when shewould talk in a normal voice, it would justboom out. It wasn't high and squeaky \u2014 itwas a voice of authority.\" In 1986, Forsythe sponsored the state's first mandatory seat belt law. It was thetoughest piece of legislation she ever spon- sored, she said, and it is the bill of whichshe is most proud. \"I was damned from one part of the state to the next,\" she said. \"It finally passed, butit was an awful lot of work. I still think itwas the right thing to do.\" Forsythe was just shy of her 70th birth- day when she left the House. The break-down of relationships between DFLers andRepublicans that she observed toward theend of her 18 years in office was regret-table, she said. \"When we first came in, you could be friends with the opposition,\" she said. \"When I left, there was far more partisan politics involved, which wasn't pleasantfor those of us who had been in office for awhile.\" Today, Forsythe and her husband, Rob- ert, divide their time between Sun City andLongville, Minn., although she is quick to Forsythe spends winters in Arizona;remembers seat belt law with pride Former Rep. Mary Forsythe poses outside the theater in herhometown, Edina, in 1990. Forsythe was the chief sponsor ofMinnesota's first mandatory seat belt law.state money will fund a variety of other initia-tives to help recovery in affected areas. Other significant measures passed by the Legislature in the final days of the sessionwould let voters in the November 1998 gen-eral election decide the fate of proposed con-stitutional amendments that would eliminatethe state treasurer's office and would protecthunting and fishing rights. If a proposed amendment were approved by voters, the treasurer's office would be elimi-nated in January 2003 and its duties would betransferred to the Office of the Secretary ofState. \"Many studies over several decades have recommended abolishing the office becauseit's a shell of its former self in terms of policy-making,\" said Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), sponsor of the bill. Another proposed amendment would de- clare that \"hunting and fishing and the takingof game and fish are a valued part of ourheritage that shall be forever preserved for thepeople and shall be managed by law and regu-lation for the public good.\" \"I believe the people of the state of Minne- sota will take this with open arms and ratifyit,\" said Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), aco-sponsor of the bill. While many significant legislative initia- tives found approval, several other notewor-thy bills ran into trouble. House members rejected a $58 million omnibus health and human services billApril 8 by voting to send the legislation back toconference committee. A battle over abortion-related provisions jeopardized the bill, which also would fundprograms for legal immigrants, children, andthe elderly, make changes in child-protection,and provide raises for nursing home workers. The House had earlier approved a version of the bill that would have banned late-term or\"partial-birth\" abortions and would have es-tablished new reporting requirements formedical professionals who perform abortions.But those provisions did not survive a House-Senate conference committee. The governor also vetoed several major pieces of legislation, including a $38 millioneconomic development bill, a $14.9 millionfamily and early childhood education spend-ing bill, and a handful of elections-relatedbills. Prior to Carlson's election, the record for career vetoes by one governor was held byformer Gov. Al Quie, who shot down 31 billsduring his one term in office. Carlson hadalready vetoed 164 bills at the outset of the1998 session, and he showed no sign of stop-ping as the session drew to a close.Carlson, who made a surprise appearance on the House floor April 9, had vetoed or line-item vetoed 10 bills as of that time. He called the spending in the omnibus jobs, housing, and economic development appro-priations bill \"clearly excessive\" and he re-minded legislators of his vision of whateven-year legislative sessions should be. The $38 million development bill included about $20 million in appropriations for hous-ing issues and $18 million in appropriationsfor statewide economic development and jobtraining. \"As I stated in my prior veto message, even- year legislative sessions were not created toenact large appropriation bills such as this,\" Carlson wrote in his veto message. \"Outside ofbonding and emergency financing, the Legis-lature should significantly limit all spendingproposals during these sessions.\" In the veto message that accompanied the family and early childhood education bill,Carlson included a simple request of lawmak-ers. \"How about considering limiting even-year sessions to three weeks and giving the public aconstitutional amendment that will allow themto create a unicameral legislature?\" Carlsonasked. Forsythe continued on page 185 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . April 2 - 9, 1998 AGRICULTURE BUSINESSHelp for grain farmers The House passed a bill April 9 that would provide $8.8 million in assistance for strug-gling grain farmers in 16 Minnesota counties,mostly in the northwest portion of the state.The vote was 95-32. Wheat and barley farmers during the past five years have lost significant parts of theircrops to a plant disease called \"scab,\" a prob-lem linked to the persistent wet weather expe-rienced in the northwestern part of the state. Farmers have seen catastrophic drops in yields as the result of scab and other wet-cycleplant diseases. At the same time, federal cropinsurance has risen in cost and dropped incoverage. The bill ( HF3853 ), sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would provide aidto help affected farmers get insurance cover-age. Under the measure, farmers whose losseshave reached a specific threshold could re-ceive up to $4,000 apiece to help pay cropinsurance premiums. The 16 counties included in the bill fall near Minnesota's entire western border, but themost widespread losses have been in thenorthwest. The eligible counties would be Beltrami, Clay, Clearwater, There are fears that many farmers whose crops are affected by scab \u2014 also known asFusarium head blight \u2014 could fold this springafter years of difficulty. During a House committee hearing on Tunheim's bill, a Kittson County farmer toldlawmakers that Minnesotans have lost $1.5billion to scab and that the problem couldwipe out many farms in northwesternMinnesota. The bill goes to the governor. Studying industrial hemp A bill that would allow the study of indus- trial hemp and its uses \u2014 an idea earlierrejected by the House \u2014 was resurrected andnarrowly passed April 9. The vote was 68-64. Bill sponsor Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) added a successful amendment stating thatconcerns of law-enforcement officials must be taken into consideration in the study. Kahn said the bill might open new financial opportunities for farmers in Minnesota be-cause hemp can be used for a variety of prod-ucts, such as paper, clothing, fiber board, twine,birdseed, and oil. The bill would direct the University of Min- nesota, working with the Department of Agri-culture and the Minnesota Bureau of CriminalApprehension, to study issues related to hempproduction. \"Industrial hemp was never banned legally. The U.S. Congress never passed a bill banningindustrial hemp. The [Drug EnforcementAdministration] has no authority to overrideCongress. What we're trying to do is get theDEA and The Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion in sync,\" she said. The bill has attracted controversy because hemp is in the same family as marijuana, anillegal controlled substance in the United Statessince 1937. Marijuana and industrial hemp carry the scientific classification of cannabis sativa, but they are significantly different plants, accord-ing to information supplied by the NorthAmerican Industrial Hemp Council. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the intoxi- cating drug in both marijuana and hemp.Marijuana contains 3 percent to 20 percentTHC, while contains percent to 1percent THC. them. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), a Min- neapolis police officer, has consistently spo-ken against the bill. \"The bill has not changed that much,\" he said. \"I urge you to vote the bill down againtonight. We all know that industrial hemp hasthe same active ingredients as marijuana.\" Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) agreed.\"The last thing the state of Minnesota needs is one more product that we can heavily sub-sidize,\" she said. But Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) said the bill is about economic development, notmarijuana. \"For the people watching us, they'd think we were smoking dope, but we're not. We'retalking about an economic development bill,\"he said. \"This is a bill similar to what wasproposed in North Dakota. Get rid of the ideathat it's a project that's going to frighten youand your constituents.\" The bill ( HF349/SF1181* ) would call forthe university to report back to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 1999. Alcohol sales on campus The sale of alcohol on state univer-sity grounds will be allowed on alimited basis, under a new law ef-fective Aug. 1, 1998. The law will allow issuance of temporary on-sale liquor licenses for events sponsored or approved by the uni-versity requesting the permit. The law will notapply to campus sporting events, fraternity orsorority parties, or other functions geared to-ward students. Legislators were told the permits will be for social functions at universities, such as playsheld on campus, where wine sales have beenrequested. The temporary licenses also couldbe used for on-campus alumni functions. Legislators also were told that community functions are sometimes held on campusesand that some civic organizations have re-quested to serve liquor on campus. The law also will allow on-sale liquor li- censes to be issued for Giants Ridge Golf andSki Resort and for Ironworld Discovery Cen-ter. A state agency, the Iron Range Resourcesand Rehabilitation Board, owns and operatesIronworld in Chisholm, Minn., and GiantsRidge near Biwabik, Minn. The fee charged for a license issued for Ironworld or Giants Ridge will have to becomparable to the fee charged in the sur-rounding area. The law also will exempt towns of 5,000 or less from a restriction that allows the sale ofonly one temporary license to a municipalitywithin a 30-day period. The exemption alsoapplies to licenses issued in connection withcommunity festivals. Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) and Sen. Sam Solon (DFL-Duluth) sponsored thenew measure.

The 1997 Legislature passed special legislation for Northwest Airlines thatretroactively exempted the airline fromMinnesota's franchise law. The state franchise law provides franchisees with some degree of protection against un-warranted termination of agreements withtheir parent companies. Legislators discovered this year that the ret- roactive exemption had an effect on pendinglitigation against Northwest Airlines. A $30 million lawsuit filed in Maine in 1994 by Northeast Express Airlines and PrecisionValley Aviation claims that Northwest Air-lines violated Minnesota's franchise law whenit dropped the two commuter airlines, forcingthem into bankruptcy. The new law clarifies that the 1997 franchise exemption does not apply to any agreementsthat were subject to litigation prior to passageof the law. The new law is effective retroac-tively to May 31, 1997. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored themeasure. HF3841/SF3397*/CH353 Omnibus crime prevention bill Gov. Arne Carlson signed omni-bus judiciary finance and crimeprevention legislation that includesseveral provisions aimed at length-ening penalties for certain crimesApril 6. One such provision in the new law will classify murder committed in the course of akidnapping a heinous crime, effective Aug. 1,1998. A person convicted of such a crimecould be sentenced to life without parole,Minnesota's toughest sentence. (Art. 2, Sec. 6) Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), who backed the provision, said that measure comesin response to the 1996 murder-kidnapping ofPaul Antonich, a Two Harbors teen-ager takenfrom his father's car in Duluth after a minortraffic accident. Another provision in the new law will make murder committed during a drive-by shoot-ing a first-degree murder crime, increasingthe prison sentence for the offense.(Art. 2, Sec. 7)The new law also will raise the maximum penalty from a five-year prison term to a 10-year term for firing into an occupied vehicle.Both drive-by shooting provisions are effec-tive Aug. 1, 1998. (Art. 2, Sec. 22) The measure also will increase penalties for felons convicted of violent offenses who arefound illegally in possession of a firearm. Cur-rently, the mandatory minimum prison sen-tence is 18 months. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, themandatory minimum will be increased to fiveyears. (Art. 2, Sec. 4) Another provision in the law will increase penalties generally for soliciting a prostituteor receiving profit from prostitution. Thisprovision, effective Aug. 1, 1998, also willincrease the penalties for engaging in prosti-tution in a school zone or in a residential area.(Art. 2, Secs. 1, 12) Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) spon-sored the legislation. Here are some other highlights of the new law. HFnone/SF3345*/CH367 Prosecuting gangs Prosecutors told legislators this year that they are having difficulties bringing gang mem-bers to trial and making the penalties stick.Several provisions in the new law seek to ad-dress such concerns. One provision will expand a current law that provides increased penalties for crimesdone for the benefit of a gang to include crimes\"motivated by involvement with\" a gang. Theprovision also will increase these enhancedpenalties. (Art. 2, Sec. 9) The new law will increase penalties for wit- ness tampering and will add witness tamper-ing to the list of crimes that can receiveenhanced penalties if done for the benefit of agang. (Art. 2, Sec. 5) The measure also seeks to get people to show up for court, both offenders and wit-nesses. One provision will increase the penaltyfor failure to appear in court if charged with afelony level crime. (Art. 2, Sec. 16) Another provision will increase penalties for individuals who knowingly and willinglydefy a court subpoena to appear in relation toa violent crime. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) These provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Charging burglars A provision of the new law will make it easier to prosecute people who illegally enter aproperty by expanding the definition of bur-glary to include accomplices. The new defini-tion is effective Aug. 1, 1998. (Art. 2, Sec. 21) Prosecutors said the new language wouldmake the law more explicit and allow them to bring charges against anyone who illegallyenters a dwelling, even if they don't actuallybreak in or steal something. Fighting drugs The new law will increase the penalties for manufacturing, possessing, or selling meth-amphetamine. Law enforcement officials saidthat Minnesota is seeing a dramatic increase inuse of the drug. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the drug will be raised to the same status as cocaine and heroin andthe manufacture of any amount of metham-phetamine will be a first-degree controlledsubstance offense. (Art. 4, Secs. 1-3) Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law will make the drug ephedrine a controlled sub-stance, to be dispensed only by prescription inmost instances. The targeted over-the-counterproducts containing ephedrine are reportedlytaken by teen-agers and others looking toachieve a legal high. (Art. 4, Secs. 5, 6) Protecting police officers Several provisions in the new law seek to make it easier and safer for police officers to dotheir jobs. One such provision comes as a result of an incident where two Richfield police officerswere accused of sexual assault. Although theallegations were proven false, the incidentgreatly disrupted the criminal justice process,not to mention the lives of the two officers. The provision will make it a criminal viola- tion to harass police officers because of theperformance of official duties by expandingthe state's stalking law. (Art. 2, Sec. 23) In addition, the new law will make it easier to prosecute people who interfere with offic-ers making an arrest by expanding the legaldefinition of obstruction of justice.(Art. 2, Sec. 17) The two provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Another provision, effective April 7, 1998, authorizes officers to conduct pat-downsearches on juveniles taken into custody. Under previous law, pat-down searches could be performed only on adult offenders.Proponents of the change argued that policeofficers need to be protected from juveniles, aswell as adults, carrying concealed weapons.(Art. 10, Sec. 10) Conditional release Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law will make several changes to the state's probationand conditional release law. The measure also will allow peace officers to detain for eight hours a person on conditional Signed by the governorSigned by the governor7 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYrelease if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the individual has violated theterms of his or her release. (Art. 7, Sec. 12) The law also allows probation officers to impose community service on people whoviolate the conditions of their parole.(Art. 7, Secs. 1, 2) The new law also authorizes the use of re- mote electric alcohol monitoring for offend-ers who agree to abstain from alcohol as acondition for pretrial release or probation.Offenders who can afford the program arerequired to pay the costs. (Art. 11, Sec. 6) Juvenile criminals A version of the legislation earlier approved by the House would have opened some juve-nile court records and proceedings to the pub-lic. For juveniles under 14 years old, the billwould have made court records available tothe public if the juvenile was found guilty of athird felony or gross misdemeanor level of-fense. For juveniles who are 14 years old orolder, the bill would have opened all courthearings to the public, regardless of theoffense. These provisions were removed by the con- ference committee. However, juvenile courtproceedings and documents will be open tothe victim of the crime, under the new law.(Art. 10, Secs. 7, 8) The measure also will increase penalties for contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.Another provision will create a civil penaltyfor this crime, requiring a person found liablefor the delinquency of a juvenile to providerestitution to victims. (Art. 10, Secs. 11, 12) The new law also will make it easier to get juveniles who are participating in prostitutioninto the state's child protection system.(Art. 10, Secs. 4-6) These provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Right to ride A provision of the new law will prohibit owners of public accommodations, such asrestaurants and hotels, from discriminatingagainst motorcyclists. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law provides exceptions if the owner feels that the person'sconduct poses a risk to property or the safetyof other patrons, or if the clothing worn by themotorcyclist is obscene or includes the sym-bol of a criminal gang. (Art. 11, Sec. 18) Reporting crime Several provisions within the new law au- thorize reports to the Legislature regardingcrime in Minnesota. One provision requests that the legislative auditor study the cost of crime in the state,including direct costs to state and local gov- ernments for criminal justice and indirect costsplaced on individuals, businesses, andneighborhoods. (Art. 1, Sec. 14) Another measure authorizes the city of Min- neapolis, Hennepin County, and the HennepinCounty District Court to provide data oncriminal justice in the city of Minneapolis.This study must be approved by both theMinneapolis City Council and the HennepinCounty Board. (Art. 2, Sec. 29) Another provision seeks more accurate in- formation on prostitution in Minneapolis andSt. Paul. The new law mandates that city attor-neys in the two cities and county attorneys inHennepin and Ramsey counties report oninvestigation and prosecution of prostitutionwithin the jurisdictions. (Art. 2, Secs. 30-31) Financing justice The measure contains $7.9 million in supple- mental appropriations, a majority of whichwill go to the Department of Corrections, theDepartment of Public Safety, and the statecourts. Of the total amount, $3 million will be recouped in revenue from increased criminaljustice fees and criminal fines. The Department of Corrections will receive $2.1 million, much of which will go to reduc-ing the caseload for probation officers. Grantprograms that fund community correctionsalso will be funded through these dollars. The Department of Public Safety will be appropriated $1.6 million. Of these funds, theoffice of the Crime Victim Ombudsman willreceive $300,000 to fund its services; theBureau of Criminal Apprehension will receive$133,000 to add forensic scientists to its crimelab; and the department will get $750,000 forlaw enforcement and community crime pre-vention grants. The state fire marshal will receive $170,000 of public safety money for the creation of anarson data system. The data base will containonly basic information at the state level butwill provide links to local criminal justice agen-cies for more detailed information on specificcases of arson. The measure will appropriate $1.1 million to the state courts for law clerk salaries. Thestate public defender will receive $1 millionfor defense attorney salaries. Another $375,000will be given to Legal Aid to provide legalservice to low-income individuals. (Art. 1) DEVELOPMENT Need a copy of a bill? Call the Chief Clerk's Office at (612) 296-2314Jobs, housing, development Citing what he referred to as\"clearly excessive\" spending, Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed theomnibus jobs, housing, and eco-nomic development appropria- tions bill April 7. The $38 million bill included about $20 million in appropriations for housing is-sues and $18 million in appropriations forstatewide economic development and jobtraining. In his veto message, the governor restated his belief that the even-year legislative sessionshould focus on bonding and emergencyissues. \"As I stated in my prior veto message, even- year legislative sessions were not created toenact large appropriation bills such as this,\"Carlson wrote. \"Outside of bonding and emer-gency financing, the Legislature should sig-nificantly limit all spending proposals duringthese sessions.\" The governor said that the bill contained several worthwhile appropriations whichshould be revisited by the Legislature, includ-ing funds to the Department of EconomicDevelopment for a vocational rehabilitationprogram and appropriations for various hous-ing programs. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Tracy Beckman (DFL-Bricelyn) spon-sored the bill. The vetoed bill included a provision that would have provided $10 million to the Min-nesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) toassist in maintaining existing low-incomehousing. That provision was the centerpieceof the $20 million housing portion of the bill. The provision was in response to a situation occurring statewide. In the 1970s, the federalgovernment set up a program where develop-ers received reduced-rate mortgages and fi-nancing incentives to build low- andmoderate-income housing. Rent rates weresubsidized by the federal government and rentincreases were regulated. Owners of many such complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allows themto prepay the remaining portion of their mort-gage and to begin charging market-rate rent. The $10 million in the bill would have funded the equity takeout loan program ad-ministered by the MHFA. The fund is used toprovide financial incentives to maintain exist-ing subsidized housing. The incentives can bemade available to local units of governmentand nonprofit organizations.Vetoed by the governor8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998The bill also would have provided $5 million to the MHFA for production ofnew multi-family, low-income housing. And the bill included $9 million in appro- priations to the Department of EconomicSecurity for job training and assistance, in-cluding $3.2 million for summer youth em-ployment and $1.4 million for the State Servicesfor the Blind to develop a digital communica-tion center for its Radio Talking Book pro-gram. The bill would have appropriated $6.2 million to the Department of Trade andEconomic Development for statewide projects.Of that amount, $3.3 million would have goneto the Minnesota Film Board to provide sup-port for the state's $250 million film and videoindustry. The appropriation would have been used to create a revolving loan film fund to be admin-istered by the film board and the Departmentof Trade and Economic Development. Thegovernor had originally requested that$5 million be appropriated for the fund. HF3806/SF3367*/CH374 EMPLOYMENT Hibbing workers' benefits About 125 workers, temporarilylaid off from the Hibbing TaconiteCo. in St. Louis County, will re-ceive extended re-employmentbenefits, under a new measure Gov.Arne Carlson allowed to become law without his signature. Effective April 4, 1998, the workers will be eligible for up to an additional 13 weeks ofbenefits. They were laid off between July and September 1997 because of lack of work. Thecompany says it expects to have them back towork by the end of May, but the workers'regular unemployment benefits ran out overthe winter. Under previous law, extended benefits were granted only to workers affected by large,permanent layoffs in counties with highunemployment. The new law exempts the Hibbing workers from three requirements: that the layoff be ofa certain size, that it be permanent, and that itoccur in a county where the unemploymentrate is more than 10 percent. The workers stillneed to meet requirements specifying thatthey be otherwise eligible for unemploymentand that they have exhausted all other rights tobenefits. Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm) said the average benefit of the affected workersis $331 per month and the total extra benefits will be about $128,000. He also said that thecompany, since it is still in business, will endup paying for most of that amount in taxes. Tomassoni and Sen. Jerry Janezich (DFL- Chisholm) sponsored the legislation.

Effective Aug. 1, 1998, employers must pro- vide \"a room or other location, in close prox-imity to the work area, other than a toiletstall,\" where a woman can privately pumpbreast milk. But employers will not be held liable if they have made a \"reasonable effort\" to comply,and the law does not contain penalties. The law will stipulate the break times can run concurrently with any other providedbreaks.

Effective Aug. 1, 1998, police, fire, and 911 dispatchers will join law enforcement personnel, health care work-ers, prison guards, and others as essentialemployees. Under that status, workers give up the right to strike, but they can still request arbitrationin a labor dispute. Supporters of the new measure said it was needed because a dispatchers' strike wouldthreaten public safety. Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen.

HF1693/SF1074*/CH355Signed by the governor FAMILY Omnibus family law bill The omnibus family law bill returned from conference committee April 8 without theambitious parenting plan provisions earlierapproved by the House. The bill won finalpassage on a 126-2 vote. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) said the Senate members of the conference committeecould not accept the new concept in marriagedissolution he pushed for this session. \"It was unfortunate that the Senate justFiled without signature9 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY didn't want to talk about reform this year,\" he said. The omnibus family law bill ( HF2784/ SF2276* ) contains several provisions that would adjust the way that child support isdecided. Most notably, one provision wouldrequire that courts consider financial obliga-tions to subsequent children of current mar-riages when figuring increases in supportpayments for children of a previous marriage. Dawkins' parenting plan proposal would have restructured state law to focus on jointdecision-making between the two divorcedparents. Under current law, the courts establish cus- tody in situations where the placement of thechild is an issue after marriage dissolution.Courts designate a custodial parent, and alldecisions concerning the child are made bythat parent. Under Dawkins' proposed language, par- ents involved in marriage dissolution pro-ceedings would have been provided the optionto compose a plan that would ensure signifi-cant participation by both parents in all deci-sion-making. The document would haveoutlined visitation and custody issues for thechild. Parenting plans could possibly be revisited by the Legislature in the future. Language for thecreation of a parental cooperation task force wasincluded in the omnibus judiciary finance andcrime prevention bill ( HFnone/SF3345*/ CH367 ) signed by the governor April 6. The task force will explore the use of parenting plans and other means to decreasethe conflict between parents involved in mar-riage dissolution, and will make recommen-dations to the Legislature and the MinnesotaSupreme Court.

Family, early childhood bill Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed the$14.9 million family and earlychildhood education spending billApril 3. The bill would have appropri- ated money for programs such as Head Startand Early Childhood Family Education, childcare assistance, emergency services grants tohomeless shelters, gang prevention, and leadabatement projects. \"The spending in this bill far exceeds the budget that I had submitted to the 1998 Leg-islature in this area,\" Carlson wrote in his vetomessage. And he reminded the legislators of last year's \"historic budget increase for child care, HeadVetoed by the governorGAME & FISH Start, and other children and family programs.\" The bill would have appropriated $5 mil- lion for a program that helps low-andmoderate-income working families pay forchild care using an income-based, sliding-feescale. The basic sliding-fee child-care pro-gram already received an increase of morethan 130 percent over the last biennium,Carlson said. Under the bill, an additional 17,000 families would have qualified for the Minnesota de-pendent care tax credit program. The bill wouldhave raised the maximum income thresholdfrom $31,000 to $38,000 at a cost of $4.9million to the state. The governor closed his veto message with a general suggestion for lawmakers. \"Even-year legislative sessions should not be allowed to become full-blown tax and spendsessions,\" he wrote. \"How about consideringlimiting even-year sessions to three weeks andgiving the public a constitutional amendmentthat will allow them to create a unicamerallegislature?\" Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) and Sen. Sen. Pat Piper (DFL-Austin) sponsoredthe bill.

Thevote was 124-7. The bill ( HF3808/SF41* ) would submit the following amendment to voters in the 1998general election: \"Shall the Minnesota Consti-tution be amended to affirm that hunting andfishing and the taking of game and fish are avalued part of our heritage that shall be for-ever preserved for the people and shall bemanaged by law and regulation for the publicgood?\" Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul), the bill's sponsor, said it is not his intent to inter-fere with treaty rights, gun control laws, orproperty rights. \"I believe the people of the state of Minne- sota will take this with open arms and ratifyit,\" said Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), aco-sponsor of the bill. The right to hunt and fish is under attack in a lot of states, said Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook). A constitutional amendment wouldsend a message \u2014 \"you're not welcome here\"\u2014 to animal rights groups who seek to curtailthe activities of hunting and fishing enthusi-asts, he said. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) said the bill's potential positive environmental impacthas turned him into a proponent. \"This amendment is as green an amend- ment as we're ever going to see,\" he said. The bill now goes to the governor. GOVERNMENT Disaster relief bill approved Weary officials from tornado-stricken south-central Minnesota told legislators viavideo conference April 6 that \"any help youcan give us would be welcome.\" The House responded by approving a $27.6 million disaster relief bill April 8 that Depart-ment of Commerce Commissioner DaveGruenes termed \"very generous.\" The votewas 131-0. \"The power that comes from hope is very well represented in this package,\" Rep. RuthJohnson (DFL-St. Peter) said on the the bill ( HF3869/ SF3411* ). Johnson's home was among the 1,000 in10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998 St. Peter to receive minor damage in the March 29 storm. St. Peter Mayor JerryHawbaker told the House Ways and MeansCommittee via the interactive television con-nection the city had another 200 homes de-stroyed, plus 600 others with major damage. The town of Comfrey, with a population of about 450, was almost completely destroyedin the string of tornadoes that promptedPresident Clinton to declare four Minnesotacounties a major disaster area. Gruenes told the Ways and Means Com- mittee the tornadoes probably caused about$200 million in damage, much of which iscovered by private insurance. The legislation would provide $8 million to match federal disaster assistance. Johnson saidthe state would assume the 10 percent contri-bution normally funded by local governmentsunder federal disaster relief. The federal gov-ernment typically pays 75 percent while statespay 15 percent and local governments pay 10percent. Another $3.5 million appropriation would be designated to those rebuilding homes. Loansup to $10,000 at no interest would go to thosewho stay in their homes for 10 years. Another$500,000 would be provided in the form offorgivable loans for the reconstruction or re-habilitation of rental housing. Businesses affected by the tornadoes would be eligible for $4.8 million in grants to helprebuild. Legislators were told that Le Center, atown of 2,000, has 400 jobless residents be-cause of the storm. Another $1 million would be set aside for local government to repair and replace pub-licly owned buildings, water systems, streets,bridges, and other infrastructure. The bill also includes $250,000 for after- school child care and expanded day careservices.

Tim Nelson, the disaster coordinator for Brown County, said more than 32,000 acres offarmland and drainage ditches are strewn withdebris, some of which is so heavy it will requireremoval by heavy machinery. But he said mostof the debris will have to be removed by hand. \"There are no machines that can do most of this work,\" he said. Legislators also were told farmers need loans for machinery and seed, but that there wasrelatively little livestock loss in the area. Under the bill, another $3.2 million would be set aside as a contingency fund that can beappropriated to the commissioner of financefor allocations made at the governor's requestor for unanticipated needs. Another $1 million would go toward loans or grants needed for historic preservation. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) told the Ways and Means Committee the state needs to lookinto federal aid for the historic buildings. \"It would be a shame if we passed up the chance to rebuild this city the way it was,\"Kahn said. St. Peter has 270 buildings that have been inventoried as possibly historic and 14 build-ings are on the National Register of HistoricPlaces. Rev. Dennis Johnson, vice president for college relations at St. Peter's damagedGustavus Adolphus College, told legislatorsthe best way to help the wounded collegewould be to help the community, where muchof the faculty and staff reside. \"We can not succeed in our mission at the college without a strong, vibrant community,\"he said. The bill now goes to the governor's desk.State treasurer's office Minnesota voters would decide whether to abolish the state treasurer's office, under a billthe House passed April 7. The vote was 88-44. The bill would place a proposed constitu- tional amendment on the November ballotasking whether the elected office should beeliminated in January 2003 and its duties trans-ferred to the Office of the Secretary of State. \"Many studies over several decades have recommended abolishing the office becauseit's a shell of its former self in terms of policy-making,\" said Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), sponsor of the bill ( HF103/SF161* ). The office used to be in charge of managing the state's permanent school fund and over-seeing unclaimed properties. Those duties havebeen transferred to the State Board of Invest-ments and the Department of Commerce,respectively. Most of the remaining responsibilities of the office, Greiling said, are cash-manage-ment duties that do not involvepolicy-making. Greiling said the purpose behind eliminat- ing the office \"is not to be saving money but tohave one less elected figure.\" Of the 13 current employees in the treasurer's office, two positions \u2014 those of thetreasurer and the assistant treasurer \u2014 wouldlikely be cut. The other positions would betransferred to the secretary of state's office. Anestimated $150,000 would be saved in salaries. An earlier version of the bill called for the office's remaining duties to be transferred tothe commissioner of finance. However, HouseSpeaker Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Cen-ter) offered an amendment during an April 3hearing before the House Rules and Legisla-tive Administration Committee that changedit to the secretary of state's office. \"Then you still have an elected person who's independent from the governor's administra-tion to look at the state's financial system,\"Carruthers said. Under the bill, voters would vote twice more for treasurer: once in November, at the sametime they would vote on the constitutionalamendment, and once again in 2000 for a finaltwo-year term. The Senate passed the House-amended ver- sion April 8, so the bill will become law. Thegovernor has no power to veto proposed con-stitutional amendments.

Carlson said he was troubled by what he called misrepresentation by the attorneygeneral's office concerning a 1995 budget ap-propriation. He said the office had requested$3 million for one-time technology upgradesin 1996 and 1997 but had, in fact, spent about$2 million of that money on salary increases. That $2 million then expanded the office's budget base and led to an increased request forfuture funding, according to the governor. \"Frankly, the Office of the Attorney General possesses a division that deals with consumerissues and insists on high standards of truth-fulness,\" Carlson wrote. \"Those standards werenot applied to the 1996-1997 budgetexpenditures.\" But the governor left $23 million for the office's 1999 expenses in the $32 million om-nibus state government finance bill he signedApril 6. Last year, he used his line-item veto author- ity to strike the attorney general's entire 1999budget of $24.4 million, citing what Carlsoncalled the enormous and unnecessary growthof the office since 1991. This year's $23 million appropriation will go for core functions of the state's top legaland law enforcement agency for the fiscal yearthat begins July 1. The office is responsible forasserting and defending the state's legal inter-ests, settling claims, and aiding other law en-forcement agencies in prosecuting and solvingcases. The $1.1 million line-item vetoed by Carlson would have provided: $500,000 legal ser-vices to state agencies; $250,000 for for with felony prosecutions and re-lated tasks; and $100,000 for a fund to educatesenior citizens about telemarketing fraud. Carlson also noted that the $23 million appropriation represents a 13.6 percent in-crease over the office's previous base funding. \"Therefore, this line-item veto will do little more than return their service to normal,\" hewrote. The new law also calls for a task force to study the availability, effectiveness, and costof legal services provided by the attorneygeneral's office. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) and Sen. Len Price (DFL-Woodbury) sponsoredthe legislation. HF3137/SF3354*/CH366Line-item vetoed by the governorSigned by the governorClaims against the state The family of a 14-year-old girlkilled in 1991 by a convicted sexoffender on his way from prison toa halfway house will receive almost$15,000, under a new law signed bythe governor April 6. David and Gayle Johnson of Alexandria, Minn., filed a wrongful-death suit against thestate after their daughter was murdered by aconvict who had been released from St. Cloudprison five days earlier and ordered to reportto a halfway house in Minneapolis. He was notassigned an escort and did not show up at thehalfway house. Following the murder, the Legislature changed the law to require that escorts beprovided in similar situations, but the Minne-sota Supreme Court rejected the parents' claim. The Johnsons next turned for recourse to the Minnesota Legislature's Joint House-Sen-ate Subcommittee on Claims, which annuallyhears private restitution claims that have beenrefused by the courts or a state governmentdepartment. Effective April 7, 1998, this year's claims law authorizes payment of certain of those claimsagainst the state, as recommended by the sub-committee. A Benton County deputy who, in 1996, shot and killed a suspect in the murder of a St.Joseph police officer will receive about $24,000.The deputy later suffered from post-traumaticstress syndrome and was unable to work foreight months, but she was refused lost-wagepayment by Benton County. Several inmates or former inmates who suf- fered injuries while incarcerated, as well assome people injured while performing court-ordered community service, also will receivepayments this year. Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsoredthe claims legislation.

Certain employees of that bu- reau who retire before age 55 will now beeligible for employer-paid health insurance. The new law, signed by the governor April 2, also ratifies labor agreements withstate employment unions, compensation plansfor state employees who are not representedSigned by the governorby unions, and salaries for state agency heads. Those agreements, plans, and salaries had already been approved by a joint legislativesubcommittee on employee relations, and havebeen in effect on an interim basis. The new law also makes a small change to the salary of the Iron Range Resources andRehabilitation Board commissioner. That sal-ary now is capped at 75 percent of thegovernor's salary and is to be set by the gover-nor. Previously, the Legislative CoordinatingCommission set that salary. Rep.

Arne Carlson al-lowed a bill granting full pay tostate employees who volunteer forthe American Red Cross to becomelaw without his signature, he wrotethat the legislation \"truly repre- sents poorly thought-out public policy.\" The new law, effective Aug. 1, 1998, allows any state employee to receive 100 percent paywhile volunteering for the Red Cross for up to15 days per year. \"Clearly, the intent is noble . . . but this bill goes well beyond the normal parameters ofgood judgment,\" Carlson wrote. He said the legislation was flawed for in- cluding only state employees and not private-sector or local government workers, and alsofor including volunteering with only the RedCross and not other disaster-relieforganizations. \"At the same time, how can a person be a 'volunteer' while receiving 100 percent pay?\"he wrote. He added that he hoped the Legisla-ture would consider altering the policy in thefuture. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls)sponsored the measure. HF2673*/SF1946/CH356 HEALTH Prenatal alcohol abuse Gov. Arne Carlson signed a billinto law April 6 which will autho-rize the voluntary reporting of pre-natal alcohol abuse. The legislation comes as a result of recommendations made by the Governor's Task Force on Fetal AlcoholSigned by the governorFiled without signature12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998Syndrome, which was chaired by first lady Susan Carlson. The task force was formed in July 1997 to formulate a comprehensive approach to theproblem of alcohol abuse during pregnancy.Approximately 800 children are born eachyear in Minnesota with the effects of FetalAlcohol Syndrome, according to the task force. Effective Aug. 1, 1999, the new law will permit health care workers, counselors, andothers working with pregnant women to re-port instances of suspected alcohol abuse tolocal welfare authorities. The law will require that the local welfare agency then conduct an assessment and offernecessary services to the pregnant woman. An earlier version of the bill would have made prenatal abuse of alcohol statutorygrounds for civil commitment and requiredlocal welfare agencies to petition for commit-ment in cases where the woman fails to followtreatment recommendations. The civil commitment process is used to require individuals to accept health care when,because of mental illness or other reasons,they do not realize the need for treatment.Civil commitment usually prompts hospital-ization, which allows the individual to bemonitored and effectively treated. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) sponsoredthe new measure. HF3184*/SF3207/CH361 HIGHER EDUCATION Omnibus higher education bill The House passed an omnibus higher edu- cation bill April 8 that aims to stabilize tuitionand represents the largest supplemental bud-get increase for higher education in this de-cade. The vote was 99-34. The $73 million in appropriations would target $36 million each for the University ofMinnesota and the Minnesota State Collegeand Universities (MnSCU) system. The re-maining $1 million would go to the HigherEducation Services Office. Opponents of the funding bill argued the appropriations would be too high in the non-budget year of the biennium. The appropria-tion is $10.5 million below the governor'srequest for higher education. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) said enough operating money wasappropriated last year and the Legislature\"ought to be looking at only cleanup mattersand emergency issues.\" Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona), chairof the Higher Education Finance Division of the House Education Committee and sponsorof the bill, said in the last decade higher edu-cation funding has decreased from 15 percentto 11 percent of the overall state budget. He also said the Legislature has previously funded higher education with \"one-timemoney, but colleges go on two- and four-yearcycles.\" Here's a look at some highlights of the bill. Funding for MnSCU A total of $20 million would reduce funding variances in state appropriations for full-yearequivalent students at the 36 MnSCUinstitutions. MnSCU was created in 1995 by the merger of Minnesota's technical, community, andstate colleges. Minnesota currently spends more per stu- dent at some two-year institutions than atsome of its four-year campuses. Significantdisparities exist in the amount of money thestate's institutions receive per full-time equiva-lent student. For example, Southwest State University receives about $2,000 more per student thanMankato State University. The variance be-tween the highest- and lowest-funded stateuniversities for fiscal year 1998 is 54 percent,and the disparity among two-year schoolsreaches 90 percent. Legislators expect MnSCU to develop its own allocation model beginning with fiscalyear 2000. The model is supposed to minimizecampus and system reliance on one-time fund-ing, and reduce the variation in per studentfunding. Another $10 million would enhance part- nerships between campuses and the privatesector. The appropriation contains money toincrease the number of students enrolled ininternships by providing incentives for busi-nesses to train, place, and retain hard-to-placeindividuals. There is also $3 million projected for librar- ies, although neither the governor nor MnSCUofficials requested funds for the acquisition oflibrary materials. Another $3 million was included in the bill so colleges could redesign their curriculumand train would-be teachers for implementa-tion of the state's new K-12 GraduationStandards. The governor's budget had requested $42 million for the MnSCU system. University of Minnesota spending More than $25 million of the appropriation for the U of M would be set aside for academicinitiatives and equipment in digital technol-ogy and molecular and cellular biology.Both the governor and the university had asked for $41.5 million in totalappropriations. U of M President Mark Yudof has focused on investing in the school's molecular andcellular biology initiatives in his first year aspresident. His goal is to create an institute for molecu- lar and cellular biology with the aim of push-ing the school into the top five publicuniversities in biological sciences. In his supplemental budget request, Yudof requested funds to recruit 11 blue-chip facultymembers during the next three years and toprovide them with expensive equipmentneeded for research. The president also in-tends to hire another 15 junior faculty byredirecting current U of M funding. The legislation would provide $9.8 million for faculty and staff compensation, $6.6 mil-lion for equipment, and $700,000 for designof a digital computation laboratory. Another $7.9 million would be targeted for molecular and cellular biology, and $3 millionfor research of industries based on renewablenatural resources. There is also $250,000 forlaw clinic programs operated by the U of Mlaw school. No grade 13 A proposal intended to create a tax credit for the first year of postsecondary school costsfor Minnesota high school graduates was re-moved from the higher education bill by aHouse-Senate conference committee. The plan would allow families of high school graduates to deduct $500 when they filed theirstate tax return if the child enrolled in a Min-nesota postsecondary school in the fall and ifthe family fit certain income limits. The federal government recently established the Hope Scholarship Credit, which calls for a$1,500 credit for those who come under thesame income guidelines. The one-time state credit would have ap- plied to tuition and educated-related expenses. Regent elections unchanged A House provision stipulating a change in the University of Minnesota regent electionprocess was also removed by the conferencecommittee. The provision, which would have set new residency requirements, was the result of ajoint House and Senate subcommittee recom-mendation to have the board's membershipreflect various parts of the state. Currently, candidates are selected from each of Minnesota's eight congressional districts.The measure would have required at least fiveregents to live in the seven-county metropoli-tan area.13 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYHFnone/SF3297* now moves to the governor's desk. HUMAN SERVICESINDUSTRY Health, human services bill House members rejected a $58 million omnibus health and human services billApril 8 by voting to send the legislation back toconference committee. A battle over abortion-related provisions jeopardized the bill, which also would fundprograms for legal immigrants, children, andthe elderly, make changes in child-protection,and provide raises for nursing home workers. The House voted 84-48 to return the bill to conference committee. The House also voted79-53 to appoint new conference committeemembers. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) had earlier replaced twoHouse members of the conference committeein an effort to get the votes required to movethe bill to the floor. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), the bill sponsor and chair of the finance division ofthe House Health and Human Services Com-mittee, remained on the conference commit-tee. The new members were Rep. John Dorn(DFL-Mankato), who is the Health and Hu-man Services chair, and Reps. Kathy Tingelstad(R-Andover), Bill Haas (R-Champlin), andCarlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul). Seventy-five House members had previouslyTelephone Assistance Plan A new surcharge on cellular telephones would help pay for expansion of the Tele-phone Assistance Plan (TAP), under legisla-tion the House passed April 3. The vote was74-55. The bill would add about 150,000 Minne- sota households to the TAP, which currentlyprovides assistance for basic telephone serviceto about 50,000 low-income senior citizensand people with disabilities. The version of the bill the Senate approved earlier would have exempted cellular phonesfrom any surcharge to fund the program andwould have increased the monthly 6-cent sur-charge on standard lines to 12 cents per line in1999 and to 16 cents in the year 2000. Under the compromise worked out by a House-Senate conference committee, cellularphones would be included, but the surchargecould not exceed 10 cents a month on cellular,business, and residential lines. The new surcharge would begin in 1999 and would not apply to telephone pagers. The bill ( HF3074/SF2718* ), sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), resulted from an expansion of the program under the direc- tion of the Federal CommunicationsCommission. The new version of the TAP makes no refer- ence to age or disability; it simply broadens theprogram to include single-person householdsat or below 100 percent of the federal povertylevel and multiple-person households at orbelow 150 percent of the level. A family ofthree with an income just under $20,000 an-nually would qualify. Until recently, the federal government and the state each paid $3.50 per program recipi-ent monthly, for a total of $7. As of Jan. 1, thefederal share rose to $5.25, with an additional$1.75 if each state contributes $3.50. If Minne-sota continues to contribute $3.50, the totalassistance for eligible households would reach$10.50 a month. Clark's bill would provide the additional revenue the state needs to cover the growth inenrollment in the program. A residential household that participated in the TAP prior to Aug. 1, 1998, is entitled toreceive continued telephone assistance creditswhether or not the household meets the newincome criteria. Heidi Myhre of West St. Paul holds her sign from the second floor railing of the Capitol rotundaas several hundred supporters of social programs included in the omnibus health and humanservices bill rally April 7. The bill became bogged down in controversy over abortion-relatedprovisions.Health and human services rallysigned a pledge to not support the bill(HF2868/SF3346* ) if it returned from con- ference committee without a ban on late-termor \"partial-birth\" abortions and without abor-tion reporting requirements. The version of the bill earlier passed by the House included the ban and the reportingrequirements, but the Senate version of thebill did not. The bill that emerged from con-ference committee also did not. The Senate has adopted the conference com- mittee bill, but it would stall without Houseapproval. The bill contains a provision for revamping the child-protection system. It would reduce,in most cases, the time a child spends in fostercare, and would consider the best interest ofthe child when reuniting the child with his orher family. Without the provision, the statecould lose more than $50 million in federalmoney. The bill included a 3 percent wage increase for nursing home employees, along with fundsfor food stamps for about 10,000 legal immi-grants in the state who will no longer be eli-gible for federal food stamps. Minnesota also could lose millions in fed- eral funds targeted to buy health care coveragefor uninsured children in the state. Under afederal \"KidCare\" program, Minnesota couldreceive $28 million annually. But the moneyhas been withheld from Minnesota becausemost children eligible for the federal programalready receive MinnesotaCare health insur-ance for low-income workers.

The provision is effective Aug. 1, 1998. Current law requires these notices to con- tain the same information. The new law re-moves language pertaining to anticipateddischarge of explosives when only a survey isbeing done. The Minnesota Pipeline Safety Act of 1987 mandated the establishment of a one-call no-tification center for facility operators, whichbecame the Gopher State One-Call. That actincluded definitions and requirements for no-tices given by excavators and undergroundfacility operators. Underground facility operators include those who deal with electricity, power, heat,gas, oil, and water. The new law also requires, as of Jan. 1, 1999, that operators maintain maps, drawings, dia-grams, and other records of any undergroundfacility that was abandoned or out of serviceafter Dec. 31, 1998. And the new measure will allow the com- missioner of public safety to appoint a pipe-line advisory committee. The new provision iseffective June 30, 1998. This discretionary advisory committee would replace the Pipeline Safety AdvisoryCouncil, and it would be governed by thestatute pertaining to advisory councils andcommittees rather than administrative boardsand agencies. The difference is that members on advisory councils and committees serve at the pleasureof the appointing authority. Members of thecurrent council may be removed for missingthree consecutive meetings. The new committee would consist of repre- sentatives of the hazardous liquid pipelineindustry, the gas distribution industry, the gaspipeline industry, the pipeline design and con-struction industry, state or local government,and the general public. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) spon-sored the legislation. HF3324/SF2445*/CH348INSURANCE LAW LOCAL GOVERNMENTSigned by the governorNo rebate on coverage The House passed a bill April 3 that would prohibit insurance companies from \"rebat-ing,\" or selling identical coverage to one poli-cyholder at a lower price than otherpolicyholders. The vote was 109-20. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), who owns and operates an insur-ance agency. He said insurance rebating doesnot help the consumer. \"It really disrupts the process. Insurance is not something you just go give away free,\" hesaid. He said the bill has the support of the insur- ance industry. \"It basically says you can't be an insurance agent enticing people by giving away free poli-cies or by rebate,\" Davids said. Insurance is an important commodity that ought to be bought with careful consider-ation, and the insurance agent is supposed toexplain parts of it the client doesn't under-stand, he said. The bill ( HF3402/SF2928 *) goes to the governor. Protection for news media Gov. Arne Carlson allowed a mea-sure providing new protections forthe news media to become lawwithout his signature April 6. However, the governor did take the opportunity to comment on what he referred to as a \"disturbing trend\" injournalism in a letter filed with the bill. Effective April 7, 1998, the new law expands the current media shield law by guaranteeingprotection for reporters' notes and tapes ex-cept in extreme instances. Carlson, in his two page letter, wrote that while the freedom of the press must be main-tained, he is concerned about the lack of ac-countability in journalism, especially withinvestigative journalism. \"News organizations often justify their ac- tivities based on the public's 'right to know,'\"Carlson wrote. \"It is ironic, however, that themedia seldom extend that right to the waythey do business.\" Journalists have no boards of professional responsibility like lawyers, doctors, and ac-countants to ensure ethical behavior, accord-ing to the governor. \"Granting this law's special protection tothe news media would be more palatable if it were a profession that adhered to a strict codeof journalistic conduct,\" Carlson wrote. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul) sponsoredthe new measure. HF1668/SF1480*/CH357 Absentee ballots without 'reason' A bill that would have establishedan absentee ballot pilot project forHennepin County was vetoedApril 9 by Gov. Arne Carlson. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), called for apilot project that would have allowed voters tovote by absentee ballot without having to givea reason, as long as they supply their name,address, signature, and other basicinformation. It's the fourth bill relating to election law that Carlson has vetoed in the past two weeks,including a bill that would have extended asimilar absentee ballot pilot project in RamseyCounty, and he noted that in his veto message. \"What do we hope to learn from the Minne- apolis project that was not demonstrated inRamsey County? We know what the benefitsand drawbacks of an open ballot system are \u2014if it is a good idea, then take it statewide,\" hewrote. Under present law, people wanting to vote absentee must have a reason, such as an ill-ness, disability, observance of a religious holi-day, or service as an election judge. Carlson noted that changes to election law are too important to be \"laced with partisan-ship. I cannot support changes to our electionlaws when not a single Republican in the House,and relatively few in the Senate, supported thebill,\" he wrote. \"Increasing voter turnout, especially in our large cities, is an admirable goal; but simplify-ing the process is only a very small part of thesolution. Issues and candidates move peopleto vote. I suggest we focus on those criticalparts to move the citizens of Minneapolis tothe polls,\" Carlson concluded. Jefferson and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill. HF2293/SF2118*/CH370 Nonprofit corporations A new state law permits Brown County and other political subdivisions to create nonprofitcorporations to help with economic develop-ment.Vetoed by the governor Filed without signature If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.us15 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYThe measure has been filed with the secre- tary of state without the governor's signature.It empowers such nonprofit corporations toissue bonds, make grants to companies, and tobuy, sell, and develop property. Gov. Arne Carlson allowed the measure to become law, but he clearly did not approve ofits content. \"It gives local governments the power to create entities with broader powers than theentity itself,\" Carlson wrote, in a letter filedwith the measure. \"This is a dangerous prece-dent being established by the Legislature.Moreover, these local entities \u2014 while havinggreater powers than local governments \u2014 arenot subject to some of the same legal require-ments such as open meeting laws, competitivebidding, the Data Practices Act, and the Ethicsin Government Act.\" Carlson also was bothered by the expansion of power to many other nonprofit corpora-tions, which he believes \"has now opened thedoor to widespread misuse by these entities.\" When introduced in the House, the mea- sure applied only to Brown County, but it wasamended to include similar corporations cre-ated elsewhere before June 1, 1997, by allow-ing them to continue to operate. The budget of any such corporation must be made public, and if the corporation is goingto spend more than $100,000, it has to beapproved by the county board. The new law took effect April 8, 1998, ex- cept for the section devoted to Brown County,which is retroactive to July 10, 1990. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) and Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm)sponsored the measure. HF2700/SF2192*/CH360 TOURISM TAXES Omnibus tax bill It took weeks of conference committee ne- gotiations, but the omnibus tax bill, whichincludes $500 million in property tax rebatesand more than $400 million in property taxreform, won final passage in the House April9. The vote was 100-33. \"We've worked long and hard,\" said Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), chair of the HouseTaxes Committee. \"This bill is the result ofcompromises on both sides.\" Opposition to the bill ran pretty much along party lines, with Republicans insisting thatmore of the state's projected $1.9 billion sur-plus should go to the taxpayers, and DFLersmaintaining that the bill would provide re-bates for taxpayers and significant reform. Rep. H. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth)urged that the bill be returned to the confer- ence committee. He said he is not satisfiedwith the proposed $500 million in rebates. \"It's not enough. It's $500 million out of $1.9 billion,\" he said. \"There's no permanenttax cut that you permanently give back totaxpayers. It's very reasonable for us to expectthat taxpayers have a permanent tax cut.\" Long responded by defending the tax plan.\"If you knew what was in the bill, you couldn't make the statements you continue tomake. There are permanent property tax cutsfor all Minnesota businesses and apartmentowners in the bill,\" she said. Here's a look at some highlights of the bill (HF3840 ). Property tax rebates The bill would provide a rebate for homeowners and renters equal to 20 percentof the property taxes paid in 1998, similar tothe rebate in effect for property taxes paid byhomeowners and renters in 1997. The maxi-mum rebate would be $1,500. The rebate wouldbe allowed as a refundable income tax credit tobe claimed on the 1998 income tax return filedin 1999. In the earlier version of the bill approved by the House, there was a proposal for an addi-tional rebate to be sent out later this fall thatwould equal 50 percent of the regular 1997rebate. The \"no-wait rebate\" is not part of theconference committee version of the bill. Property tax reform Property taxes for homeowners, businesses, and others would be reduced, under the finalversion of the bill. The tax classification rate for the second tier of residential homestead property (value over$75,000) would go from 1.85 percent to 1.7percent. The class rate of the first $115,000 in market value of agricultural homestead propertywould go from 0.4 percent to 0.35 percent.The class rate on the market value of over$115,000 and under 320 acres would go from0.9 percent to 0.8 percent. The class rate onmarket value over $115,000 and 320 acreswould go from 1.4 percent to 1.25 percent. There also would be a break for owners of commercial and industrial property. Class rateson that property valued up to $150,000 wouldgo from 2.7 percent to 2.45 percent. The uppertier, over $150,000, would go from 4.0 percentto 3.5 percent. Owners of apartment buildings with four or more units would see their class rates go from2.9 percent to 2.5 percent, and owners ofrental houses would see their class rates gofrom 1.9 to 1.25 percent for the first tier, andfrom 2.1 to 1.7 percent on the upper tier.The bill also would require that the state's budget reserve (now $522 million) be $622million in November of odd-numbered years,and would establish a tax reform and reduc-tion account, with the governor proposing tothe Legislature how the account would beused. Any surplus in the state's November eco- nomic forecast would be used as follows: Atotal of $200 million of that surplus would goto the tax reform and reduction account fortax reductions, and the next $400 millionwould go to reduce the amount of bonding topay for capital projects in the 1998 bondingbill. Any amount above that would become abalance in the general fund. The bill which, passed the Senate on a 66-1 vote, now goes to the governor. Fishing dispute resolution A resolution asking President Clinton and the U.S. Congress tohelp settle fishing-rights disputesbetween Minnesota and the Cana-dian province of Ontario has beenfiled with the Office of the Secre- tary of State without the governor's signature. The resolution urges the federal govern- ment to seek a solution to the border troublesthat have spawned a proposal to allowMinnesota's Northwest Angle to secede fromthe United States. The approximately 85 year-round residents of the Northwest Angle have complained foryears about Canadian policies including fishlimits, user fees, and border crossing permitsthat they say discriminate against U.S. anglers. The Northwest Angle, the northernmost spot of the continental U.S., is actually a CANADA MINNESOTAMinnesota's Northwest Angle Lake of the WoodsArea of detailMinnesota's Northwest Angle WarroadFiled without signature16 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998TRANSPORTATIONpeninsula on Lake of the Woods that is at- tached only to Canada. According to Canadian law, tourists fishing the two-thirds of the lake in Canada, andstaying in Canadian resorts, may keep up totwo walleye or sauger per day. But beginningthis summer, anglers staying at U.S. resortswill not be allowed to keep either of those fishif pulled from Canadian waters. Canadianssay the regulations are needed because thespecies are overfished, but Americans say theyare driven by a desire to force tourists to stayat Canadian resorts. U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) intro- duced a constitutional amendment March 18that would let the Angle and nearby islandsseparate from the United States, allowing resi-dents and tourists to enjoy the Canadian fish-ing privileges. Peterson said he sees secession as a long shot but that he sponsored the proposal in order tobring attention to the plight of affected an-glers. He also said the Canadian regulationsviolate a 1909 border-waters treaty and theNorth American Free Trade Agreement butthat the federal government has not takenaction to protect U.S. rights in the area. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls)sponsored the legislation. HF3854*/SF3406/Res.8 Omnibus transportation Gov. Arne Carlson got many of theextra state troopers he had wantedfor two years when he signed a $51million omnibus transportation billinto law April 7. The new law also allows the De- partment of Transportation to spend up to$40 million on new highway projects. And thelaw will create a task force designed to catchMinnesota residents who illegally register theirvehicles in neighboring states. Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston) and Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch) spon-sored the legislation. Here is a look at major provisions of the new law. All of the provisions detailed below areeffective July 1, 1998. HF3057/SF3298*/CH372 State troopers The governor had originally requested 47 ad- ditional state troopers and support staff at a costof $5.25 million. In 1996, the governor soughtfunds to hire an additional 46 state troopers, butthe Legislature approved only enough funding for four state patrol dispatchers. Under the new law, there will be $2.7 mil- lion in funding for 29 new state troopers, andthere is $200,000 for additional state patrolhelicopter flight time. Legislators were told helicopter patrols, which are currently used only on Friday andSaturday nights, are perhaps the greatest singleboost ground patrols receive in law enforce-ment efforts. The funding will allow the pa-trols to fly during weekday evenings as well. The state patrol's current complement is 535 troopers, including 37 that are expected to shortlygraduate from training. The new troopers wouldincrease the allowable force limit to 564. Highway projects A total of $40 million will be appropriated from the trunk highway fund for highwayconstruction projects in fiscal year 1999. Another $6.8 million from the trunk fund will be available for design engineering andconstruction engineering. Also, the new law stipulates that the town bridge account may be used to pay the cost ofabandoning an existing bridge that is deficientbut will not be replaced. The account also will be used to pay to construct a road or street to facilitate the aban-donment of a deficient bridge if it is deter-mined the construction of the road or street ismore cost-efficient than replacing the existingbridge. Lake Street planning board A provision in the new law will establish a 13-member board to help plan and coordi-nate development of the Lake Street corridorin Minneapolis. The board would have juris-diction over one-half mile on either side ofLake Street. The board's purpose will be to concentrate on economic development, transportation,and residential renewal in the area in coordi-nation with local government, businesses, andother neighborhood entities. If light rail transit becomes a reality in the state, this area is expected to be affected by theHiawatha Corridor of the transit line. The members will have a three-year term ending June 30, 2001. Registration task force A dealer licensing and motor vehicle regis- tration enforcement task will be created, un-der the new law. A total of $50,000 from the highway user tax distribution fund will be allocated to thecommissioner of public safety, who is to des-ignate four state highway patrol members toinvestigate the incidence of vehicle registra-tion evasion and dealer fraud. It is believed countless Minnesota residents register their motor vehicles in neighboringstates, which have lower licensing fees. Esti-mates indicate this costs the state millionsannually, even though it is a gross misde-meanor for vehicles owned and operated inMinnesota to be registered in another state. The task force's final report is to go to the governor and the Legislature by Feb. 15, 1999.The task force expires July 1, 2000. Driver's licenses and teens The House passed a three-tiered driver's licensing system for teen drivers April 8 thatwould require Minnesota's younger drivers toacquire a learner's permit and then a provi-sional driver's license before receiving a fulldriver's license. The vote was 68-64. People under 18 could not apply for a full driver's license unless they had driven one yearfree of certain driving convictions and had atleast 10 hours of supervised driving with a li-censed driver 21 or older, under the bill. Currently, 15-year-olds can receive a learner's permit (which they must hold for sixmonths) and 16-year-olds can apply for a fulllicense. The bill stipulates that the teen would have to be free of conviction in a crash-relatedmoving violation and have no more than onedriving conviction unrelated to a crash to beeligible for a full license. Parking and equip-ment violations or warning citations wouldnot count against the teen. Under the bill ( HF2532/SF2407* ), if a teen were convicted of a traffic violation, the teencould face not only the penalties that apply tothe offense but also be required to attend ayouth-oriented driver improvement clinic. The clinics would be designated for traffic violators age 18 and under to assist them incorrecting improper driving practices and re-view provisions of traffic law. The clinics wouldfocus on driving problems common to novicedrivers. The holder of a provisional license would be able to drive only when every occupant underthe age of 18 has a seat belt or child passenger seatproperly fastened. There would be a $25 fine forviolating the provision, but a citation could beissued for the seat belt violation only if a lawofficer stopped the car for a moving violation. A total of $295,000 would be appropriated from the trunk highway fund for fiscal year1999 to the commissioner of public safety forthe implementation of the licensing systemand for youth-oriented driver clinics. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the legislation. Signed by the governor17 April 10, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Grant Martin It is strangely appropriate that a significant plan to expand the Capitol complex in theGopher State would center on a proposedunderground facility. A national competition to design a Capitol annex was authorized by the Legislature in1973. The competition, called Minnesota II inreference to the first Capitol design competi-tion in 1893, was administered by the newlyformed Capitol Area Architectural and Plan-ning Board (CAAPB). The proposed facility was to have legislative hearing rooms, museum space for the Minne-sota Historical Society, a cafeteria, and park-ing \u2014 almost 400,000 square feet total. And the proposed facility had to fit entirely under the Capitol mall. Most parties agreed that an expansion was necessary for several reasons. Hearing roomsin the state Capitol were inadequate, partlydue to the new demands of annual legislativesessions. Open meeting laws passed in 1973also increased the demand for facilities thatcould accommodate larger numbers. In addition, the Minnesota Historical Soci- ety, which was at that time located east of theCapitol in what is now the Judicial Center, wasalso strapped for space. The agency had roomfor only 1 percent of its total collection in thatfacility. The mall was selected among three sites near the Capitol mainly because of its proxim-ity between the Capitol and the HistoricalSociety. The location promised to provide theeasiest access for legislators, staff, and visitors.Disruption to the mall would be minimizedbecause the facility would be underground. \"By providing a central, easily accessible location for legislative and executive branchmeetings, the new facility will be a practicaland logical manifestation of [the] open meet-ing law as well as an expression of the values ofpolitical openness and honesty of its people,\"the CAAPB explained in the competition rulesit sent out. Members of the legislative planning com- mittee were told that an underground facilitywould save the state 50 percent in heatingcosts and 22 percent in air conditioning costs.In a time of growing energy concerns, theoption was obviously appealing. Members of the committee also were swayed by arguments that a new underground annexwould not impede the historic view of theCapitol. The competition began in full force in theUnderground expansion . . . Grand Space designed to convey 'open government' fall of 1976. During the first stage of the Min-nesota II competition, the CAAPB received261 entries. From these entries, a jury made upof architects and public figures selected fivefinalists to submit more detailed designs. Thefinalists submitted both drawings and modelsto the jury in the spring of 1977. The jury awarded the final prize to Helmut Jahn of C.F. Murphy Associates in Chicago onMarch 8, 1977. The winner was awarded$100,000, which was to be considered a downpayment on the project, had it beenauthorized.Jahn, who is probably best known for the United Airlines Terminal Complex atChicago's O'Hare Airport, is considered oneof the most influential living Americanarchitects. The winning design was a three-level struc- ture with historical exhibit space, legislativehearing rooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium,and a parking facility for 450 cars. The centerpiece of the design was what Jahn referred to as the \"Grand Space,\" a two-storyterraced tropical garden leading from the mainfloor up to the Capitol level. The garden wouldhave been covered by a 690-foot glass skylight,providing natural light to the complex. Pedes-trian traffic would have been allowed on theoutside of the skylight. Jahn wrote in his proposal that the Grand Space would symbolically communicate thefeeling of open government to all who visitedthe Capitol. \"The Grand Space is a terraced skylight tropical garden with gentle ramps forming thecirculation grid,\" Jahn wrote. \"This space isvisible from all levels, creates a spatial unity,furthers close interaction and facilitates open-ness and orientation. Every person coming tothe Capitol complex shares this spatialexperience.\" Jahn's design received an award from an Drawings from C. F. Murphy Associates, Chicago. The plans for an underground addition to theCapitol complex called for a large skylight that thearchitect said would relate \"the terratecturalstructure to the Capitol and its environs and[create] a spatial composition between above andbelow grade.\" This is the artist's sketch of theproposed facility viewed from above.\"At all times the Capitol and the open space can be viewed in ever-changing vistas,\" architect Helmut Jahn wrote in his proposal for an underground addition to the Capitol complex. \"The south wall of theCapitol becomes the northern space defining element of the underground space. The closest interactionpossible between interior and exterior is achieved.\" Shown here the view looking east along theproposed \"Grand Space.\"18 SESSION WEEKLY / April 10, 1998architecture journal in 1979. The cost of the construction was estimated at $35 million, including furnishings, equip-ment, and landscaping. Construction was setto begin in 1978, pending approval from theLegislature. After the final selection of the design, oppo- sition to the plan mobilized as critics realizedthat the project was moving from the planningstages to the appropriation phase. Several editorials appeared referring to the projects as the \"Maginot Line\" and the \"Capi-tol Bunker.\" A poll conducted by the St. Paul Pioneer Press showed that 59 percent of those questioned were opposed to the plan. Opposition also solidified in the Legisla- ture, including an announcement from ayounger Arne Carslon, then a RepublicanHouse member from Minneapolis, that he would campaign against the plan. Opponentsquestioned the need for the facility, arguedthat the project could be built on other sitesmore economically, and questioned whetherthe project would violate the integrity of themall. Opponents also questioned whether a facil- ity could be built given the presence of waterunder the mall. Senate Majority Leader Nick Coleman (DFL-St. Paul), the chief proponent of theplan, argued that the state could no longerignore the problems at the Capitol complex. \"I just can't see how we can continue to say we are encouraging public participation in thegovernmental process and then turn aroundand say, 'Sorry, there's no place to park, thereisn't room for you, and bring your own lunch.' Improving public access is the only way tofacilitate public access,\" Coleman said, asquoted in a Senate publication. The three-year process to build a Capitol annex came to an abrupt end in April 1977.Following a two-to-one vote against the planby the House DFL Caucus, Coleman tabledthe bill in the Senate. Subsequent attempts in1978 and 1979 to provide funding for theCapitol annex also failed. The space concerns of the Capitol complex were eventually eased through a more piece-meal process, including the construction ofthe new Minnesota History Center, a largeaddition to the current Judicial Center, andthe renovation of the hearing rooms in theState Office Building.

Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) brought a bill ( HF3191 ) before the House Regulated Industries and Energy Committeeasking the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)to halt its plan to put St. Paul in a new tele-phone area code. Paymar has argued the change will greatly inconvenience St. Paul businesses andresidents. PUC Chair Edward Garvey went before the committee to testify, and keeping with proto-col, announced his name and affiliation to thecommittee. \". . .

Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls) islooking forward to his secondretirement. \"I retired 12 years ago, and then I got a job at which I spent more time than I didat my original job,\" he said during a recentinterview. Jefferson's first retirement came after 32 years with the U.S. Bureau of Mines. As thehead of research services, he used his chemis-try background to oversee research into min-ing techniques and the use of resources \u2014projects that the private sector would not door couldn't afford. The federal government has since closed the Bureau of Mines. \"I like to tell people there was no need to have it after I left,\" he joked, \"but that's notexactly how it happened.\" Jefferson has been a key negotiator on sev- eral Minneapolis public facilities financingdeals, including the 1994 Target Center buyoutand this year's proposed Minneapolis Con-vention Center expansion. Of the 12 Housemembers from the Minneapolis delegation,Jefferson was the only one to vote for a newTwins stadium during the November 1997Special Session. \"I saw [those initiatives] primarily as job opportunities, as much as anything,\" he said. Jefferson said the most important piece of legislation he sponsored was a 1993 measuresetting residency requirements for publicemployees of the city of Minneapolis. \"It had the greatest impact and the most far- reaching effect on the city of Minneapolis ofanything I've ever done,\" he said. Another bill that remains close to his heart but did not receive as much attention pro-vided for the testing of newborn babies forsickle-cell anemia, a genetic blood disease thatprimarily strikes those of African descent.

Retiring lawmaker recalls legislative accomplishments purchasing and pension policies will be missed. \"It's so hard to find legislators who are willing to deal seriously with complex techni-cal issues,\" she said. \"One of his great tri-umphs was the Target Center bill, which hewas able to pass all by itself, not tucked in withsomething else. That takes an enormousamount of legislative credibility and ability.\" Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) recalls that she once had a legislative assistant who analyzedthe makeup of the House in search of \"nor-mal\" people. \"Jefferson was one of the few normal people,\" Long said. \"He's very solid, verydown-to-earth, and a heck of a good golfer.\" Besides more time on the links, Jefferson is looking forward to fishing, downhill skiing(which he took up at the age of 60), andspending time with his five children, 14 grand-children, and five great-grandchildren. He has more than 60 cactus plants to attend to, as well. He and his wife, Mary, like to travelto Texas and Arizona during the winter and,through a process of elimination, they havedeveloped an appreciation for the hearty cactus. \"The first time we went away for three weeks \u2014 we came back and all the cactus plants werefine and the other plants were in bad shape,\"he said. \"So, we specialize in cactus because wedon't have to make arrangements like we dofor the dog.\" One of the things Jefferson said he has en- joyed the most as a legislator is helping peoplewho were tied up in the bureaucracy of localgovernment. \"That's the power of this office,\" he said. \"It can be, when used properly, a very importanttool for helping people.\" But he made it clear that he has no illusions about how long the power to get phone callsreturned quickly lasts. \"The power is seated in the position, not in the individual,\" he said. \"Because the day thatI leave here, that will no longer exist for me,and the young man who comes in behind mewill be able to do those things.\" Rep. Richard Jefferson, who has announced his retirement from the House after six terms, looks forwardto a little more time both on the golf course and with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

It's nota well-kept secret that the snack bar is the bestplace to find a friendly ear and a chance tounwind from lawmaking proceedings. \"I enjoy the camaraderie, the teasing and kidding around with these guys,\" Roger said. The Larsons have been running the snack bar and stocking the Capitol-area vendingmachines since 1983. They're independentcontractors through Business Enterprises forthe Blind, so they've enjoyed creative controlover the business. Besides ice cream, they've also introduced sandwiches and more low-fat snacks to thetraditional hot-dog menu. \"We just try to have whatever we think people will like,\" Shirley said. Some items, likepizza (you had to wait 10 minutes for it tocook) and soup (too hard to eat while stand-Hot dogs, ice cream . . . Manager of Capitol's popular food stop steps down piano tuner, often having his mother drivehim around western Wisconsin to make housecalls. \"But people don't really have pianos like they used to, and I never really earned enoughto live on,\" he said. So in 1981, both Larsons started with a training program in the Veterans Buildingthrough State Services for the Blind. Two years later, they got the contract to manage the Capitol snack bar, and they haven't had anuneventful spring since. They've been working together daily for those 15 years, arriving at 7 a.m. to stock thevending machines. \"A lot of husbands and wives just plain couldn't do it,\" Roger said. \"When we startedthey told us it wouldn't work; they said they'dhad other couples try to do it and it neverworked. But we're different, and we provedthat to them.\" Although Roger's retiring mostly because of advancing Parkinson's disease, Shirley maybe back next session when a new snack barmanager comes on board. Roger, with some help from his son, will also continue to stockthe vending machines through the interim. \"So if you see me still around this summer, don't have me arrested,\" he said. He added that he'll miss the many friends he's made at the Capitol, but plans to enjoy awell-deserved rest. Roger said he feels proud to have accom- plished what he said was his biggest goal whenhe and Shirley started out in the Capitol. \"We just wanted to show people that blind people can do a lot more than you mightthink.\" ing), didn't take off like the sandwiches andice cream. For Roger, 67, running the food service has really been a second career. Although he was born in St. Paul, he went to the State School for the Blind in Janesville,Wis., at age 14.

April 3 - April 9, 1998 CH354-CH387* HF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFOnce a bill has passed both the House and Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sentto the governor for consideration. The gov-ernor, who has several options when consid-ering a bill, can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within anappropriations bill; or do nothing, which can have two differenteffects. The timing of these actions is asimportant as the actions themselves. In the second year of the biennium (even- numbered years), a bill passed by the Legis-lature and presented to the governor beforethe final three days of the session will be-come law unless the governor vetoes it byreturning it to the Legislature within threedays. The governor normally signs the billsBills await governor's action and files them with the secretary of state, buthis signature is not required. But if a bill is passed during the last three days of session, the governor has a longertime to act on it. He or she must sign anddeposit it with the secretary of state within14 days after the Legislature adjourns \"sinedie\" (Latin for adjournment \"without a datecertain\"). If the governor does not sign a billwithin this time frame, it will not becomelaw, an action known as a \"pocket veto.\" Thegovernor is not required to provide a reasonfor the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he or sheobjects. As with all vetoes (save pocket ve-toes) the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the veto with the re-turned bill. Here, too, the timetable is either14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, orwithin three days after the governor receivesthe bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

That's understandable, for Minnesota is 385miles wide, 405 miles long, and covers 86,943 miles in area. Those who made a long weeklyround trip did it as part of their elective commitment to the voters. Distances like the 22,000 miles Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston) traversed annu- ally, were minor in comparison to the trek made to St. Paul by some Territorial Councilmembers before statehood, and then others after statehood. Two members \u2014 NormanKittson, a fur trader, and Joe Rolette, a voyageur \u2014 lived in far away Pembina (now inNorth Dakota). At different sessions, they came by dog sled, traveling 30 to 40 days toarrive in St. Paul. Likewise, Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) traveled the farthest from the northwest to get to the capital city. And Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) who shares the same district,said his trip was exactly 325 miles one-way, \"from garage to garage.\" During this session, Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) would leave his northeastern home to make a 205-mile, four-hour drive south. Around the same time, at 4 a.m. onMonday mornings Rep. Michelle Rifenberg (R-La Crescent) and Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) would leave their homes in the far southeast to drive north. Like Lieder,Tunheim, Finseth, Rukavina, and Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston) they all returnedhome every Friday. But after 14 years in office, Olson stepped down and will no longer make the long weekly journey. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) has come from the farthest point north for 24 years, and Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) has religiously made the trip in for 16 years. But inrecent years, Rep. Richard \"Doc\" Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) has flown his own plane from thefar southwest when the weather was fair. Tunheim once flew in commercially from Grand Forks, N.D., 70 miles from his home. For the past two sessions, he and his wife, Diana, have driven to St. Paul. \"It took only threehours longer,\" he said. Until next session, Lieder no longer will arrive home on Saturday at 1 a.m. to his wife, Shirley, patiently awaiting him. Lieder said he had only three delays in travel during his14 years in office. \"The first was when I had to stay overnight in Sauk Centre, due to ablizzard. Another was having to wait for a herd of deer to cross the highway, like cariboumigrating. The third time was during this 1998 session.\" One Friday, as chair of the Transportation and Transit Finance Division, Lieder and others approved staff increases and funding for the highway patrol. Just 15 miles fromhome, he was given his only warning ever from a state trooper. Those who live so far away may wish to adopt the inscription on the New York City main post office: \"Neither snow, nor rain . . . nor gloom of night stays these couriers from. . . completion of their appointed rounds.\" \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLY Gov. Arne Carlson dropped in on the House April 9, the last day of a session that saw passage of a record capital projects bill and a separate measure that will provide taxpayers with another round of rebates. 1998 session wrap-up . . . Legislators focus on capital projects, tax reductions By Sandy Donovan It was a short session that produced some tall numbers. In less than 12 weeks, lawmakers cooked up and passed the state's largest-ever bondingbill, including almost $1 billion in funding foruniversities, convention centers, light-railtransit, and a St. Paul hockey arena. And they also found time to put together a package of tax rebates and reductions thattopped $1 billion. The bill would bring thebiennial tax reductions to almost $2 billion,another state record. Tax cuts and capital projects were on the agendas of both the Legislature and the gover-nor since the session opened in January with aprojected $1.3 billion surplus in state coffers. But even as the projected surplus grew closer to $2 billion, House and Senate members wereat odds as to how to best spend that money. House members advanced plans that would rebate most of the surplus to taxpayers, whileselling bonds to pay for building projectsaround the state. Meanwhile, senators called for using the surplus to pay cash for building projects, whichthey said would save money in the long run. In the end both sides compromised to reacha final agreement, hammered out during the last week of session. Tax cuts would include $500 million in one-time rebates for homeowners and rentersas well as substantial reforms in the state'sproperty tax system. And funding for the $1 billion in new capi- tal projects would be split almost evenly be-tween cash and bonds, with $552 millioncoming from the general fund and $416 mil-lion slated to come from bond sales. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) called the agreement a bal-anced plan, although a House-approvedproposal for a so-called \"no-wait rebate\" . . important goals,\" he said. \"First, it meets the goal of providingsignificant property tax relief to Minnesota'sworking families. Second, it enabled us to savemoney on building projects that not only cre-ate jobs, but which will put our colleges, parks,transportation systems, and communities ontrack for prosperity in the 21st Century.\" Much of the money earmarked for capital projects will go to initiatives backed byGov. Arne Carlson, including University ofMinnesota improvements, environmentalpreservation projects, and a St. Paul hockey arena, slated to benefit from a $65 million loanto the city. Still, some high-profile items were left out of the record bonding bill, including Carlson'sdesired veterans park in Duluth to feature theUSS Des Moines. And in other areas, lawmakers produced plans that far exceeded Carlson's January bud-get proposals. An omnibus K-12 education spending bill, which Carlson has not yet signed but hasverbally agreed to, calls for $124 million innew spending. The governor has repeatedlysaid he considers that an excessive amount ofmoney. Most of it \u2014 $70 million \u2014 would go to help districts implement the Profile of Learn-ing, a portion of the state's Graduation Stan-dards initiative, but the bill also includes Lawmakers will return for a special sessionApril 20 to resolve a civil-law issue that affectsone Minnesota firm, as well as to attempt topass revised family and early childhood andeconomic development measures. Earlier ver-sions of those two omnibus bills were vetoedby Gov. Arne Carlson.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998$12 million for Carlson-supported boarding schools for at-risk teens. The K-12 bill also would abolish the State Board of Education and begin a major reformof the state's special education system. An omnibus crime measure already signed into law imposes tougher sentences for a vari-ety of felons and includes funding for moreprobation officers and for a project to haveinmates build low-income housing. But the so-called \"three strikes\" plan, which would have mandated life sentences for crimi-nals convicted of violent crimes three times,did not make it into law. And after much debate over whether to in- crease abortion restrictions, lawmakers passed a$58 million health and human services bill thatcalls for more abortion reporting but does notprohibit so-called \"partial birth\" abortions. Other initiatives this session include two proposed constitutional amendments to beplaced on the November ballot: One will askvoters whether hunting and fishing should bepreserved as a valued part of the state's heri-tage, and the other will ask whether the statetreasurer's office should be abolished. Also beginning this year, some employers will be required to provide space and time fornursing mothers to privately pump breast milk,and telephone companies will have to providemore detailed information when trying toentice customers to switch long-distance plans. And awaiting Carlson's signature is a plan that would introduce a three-stage license sys-tem for teen-age drivers. Still, of the more than 1,600 bills introduced in the House since January, several notableones were defeated or watered down some-where along the way. A much talked-about proposal for a three- year moratorium on feedlots eventually passedthe Legislature as a two-year ban on only newopen-air lagoons for swine waste. But anothermeasure signed by Carlson included fundingfor the first year of a three-year feedlot study. Also arriving on the governor's desk in a more modest form than originally conceivedwas a plan to increase restrictions on personalwatercraft operations. Under that bill, whichawaits action by the governor, operationswould be prohibited for about a 12-hour over-night period and the shoreline no-wake zonewould be expanded. Some other high-profile bills never did make it to Carlson's desk, including a proposal toprohibit banks from levying fees on ATM users. Likewise, a House-approved plan to lower the legal blood-alcohol content for drivers didnot make it out of the Senate, and a proposedconstitutional amendment to create a perma-nent children's endowment fund will not beon the November ballot. By Matt Wetzel When former Rep. Wayne Simoneau started out as a mechanic in the late 1950s,he had no idea that roughly four decadeslater he would be capping off a career inpublic service as the commissioner of theDepartment of Finance. And working for aRepublican governor, yet. \"Didn't even think about it. Just had to go to work and buy a house,\" saidSimoneau, a former lawmaker, auto me-chanic, and Teamster. And it will soon be former finance com- missioner. With Gov. ArneCarlson leaving office in less thana year, Simoneau's service as com-missioner will be over. \"I'm going to retire,\" said Simoneau, a father of six and grand-father of seven who has put in 23years of work in state government. Simoneau, 63, lives in Fridley with his wife of 39 years, Jane. Heserved in the Legislature from 1974to 1995, representing District 46B,which includes Columbia Heightsand part of Fridley. Born in Washburn, Wis., he at- tended Dunwoody Institute inMinneapolis to learn auto me-chanics, and in 1957, went to work.He was active in his union, theInternational Brotherhood of theTeamsters, and his Fridley DFLprecinct, where he became thechair. In 1974, he became the chair of hisSenate district, and soon after, he ran forthe Legislature. On the first day of his first term in Janu- ary 1974, he knew he had a lot to learn. \"You've got to know how things work in order to make them work for you,\" he said.\"I understand government and large sys-tems and how they work. We're biggerthan 3M. You've got to understand howbig government systems work.\" The best way to do that is to wait, watch, and think, he said. And, he said, flexibility is a must,whether guiding a bill through the Legislature ornegotiating with special interests. \"Each situation is different. It's like go- ing to college constantly,\" he said. During his legislative career, Simoneau served as chair of the House GovernmentalOperations Committee and the House Ap-propriations Committee. He last held theposition of chair of the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee. Regarding his legislative work, he is most proud of an initiative to bring state em-ployees under one collective-bargainingagreement in 1980. \"We gave complete bargaining rights to state employees,\" he said. The goal was to keep the Legislature out of setting employee salaries, except thoseof the commissioners, department man-agers, and essential employees. He also was the House author of legisla- tion that pro-vided criticalassistance forNorthwest Air-lines to go to work at the Department of EmployeeRelations, first as deputy commissionerand later as commissioner. Simoneau said he doesn't consider it sur- prising that a lifelong DFLer, as he is, wasappointed to an administration job by aRepublican governor. Simoneau said he con-siders himself closer to the center then to thefar left, and that Carlson has long had areputation as a moderate Republican, closerto the center than to the far right. \"We're in the middle. That's pretty much where almost everyone in the state is,\"Simoneau said. In October 1996, a vacancy occurred for the commissioner of the Department ofFinance. Simoneau and Carlson went overthe possible choices for a replacement. \"One day Arne just called me up and said, 'You're it. Won't you go upstairs?'\"And Simoneau did. automechanic turned politician, iscurrently the state's commissionerof finance, but his long career ofpublic service will end when Gov.Arne Carlson leaves office.Simoneau says being in Legislaturewas like 'going to college constantly' 5 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . April 9 - 16 1998 BANKING Signed by the governorChecks in the mail Restrictions will be placed on theunsolicited checks that some finan-cial institutions mail to consum-ers, under a new law signed by Gov.Arne Carlson. Consumers who find such checks in their mailboxes are actually receiving loansolicitations, carrying interest rates as high as30 percent. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the new law stipulates that no financial institution or lender can sendsuch a check unless it complies with severalnew requirements. The checks will be required to become void after 30 days, and information will have to besent with the check advising consumers todestroy it if they do not use it. Consumers will have to be told in plain terms that the check is a loan, and the loanagreement will have to be on the back of thecheck. If such a check is fraudulently cashed by someone other than the addressee, the con-sumer is to be absolved from liability by sign-ing a statement saying he or she did not cashthe check. The check will have to be mailed in an envelope that does not indicate its contents.Also, it must not be forwarded if the consumerno longer lives at the address. Bill sponsor Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) said during House floor discussion of themeasure that he recently received one suchcheck \u2014 for thousands of dollars \u2014 in themail. He said if the check would have been lost or stolen, and cashed, it would have been a hard-ship. He said his legislation puts procedures inplace to protect the consumer.

Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) said the law will help womenwho were conscientious borrowers while mar-ried, but find themselves unable to securecredit after a death or divorce because thecredit history exists solely in their formerspouse's name. \"There are times when an applicant finds she has no credit history,\" Leppik said. \"This[will] give that person recourse to state courtand small claims court.

The law will cover the debit cards that financial institutions issue toholders of checking accounts. Be- sides getting cash out of automatic teller ma-chines, consumers can use debit cards to makepurchases that are directly deducted from theirchecking account, as long as the merchant hasa terminal that can handle debit cardtransactions. The law will limit customer liability to $50 if the card is lost or stolen. The limit will applyto unauthorized transactions made before thebank receives notice that the card has been lostor stolen.

HF3389/SF2493*/CH337 BONDINGSigned by the governor House approves bonding bill The 1998 bonding bill \u2014 complete with a $65 million loan for the St. Paul RiverCentrehockey arena \u2014 awaits action from the gover-nor after being approved by the House April 9.The vote was 86-47. The bill ( HF3843 ), sponsored by Rep. Henry Kalis (DFL-Walters), appeared to be headedfor disaster a few weeks ago. The House-Senate conference committee could not agree on the RiverCentre appro-priation, and Gov. Arne Carlson was threat-ening to veto all or parts of the bonding bill ifthe appropriation was absent. The $130 million arena plan itself also ap- peared to be in jeopardy. With the early stagesof construction about to begin, it looked likethe city would have to shoulder the financialburden of the facility, possibly damaging thecity's bond credit rating. Members of the St. Paul City Council were considering measures to delay the demolitionof the current arena until the financing issuewas settled. It seemed that attempts to bring NHL hockey back to Minnesota might be in trouble. A renegotiated lease between the city of St. Paul and the Minnesota Wild hockey teamfinally provided the necessary boost to resolvethe stalemate. The new lease allows the state to receive payments on its loan and gives the city of6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998St. Paul the ability to assume more of the debt without risking its bond credit rating. Under the bonding bill, the state would provide a $65 million interest-free loan to thecity to assist in the construction of the hockeyfacility. The bill would require that $48 million of the loan be repaid by the Minnesota Wildthrough a set payment schedule over the next20 years as outlined in the bill. The paymentsrange from $1.25 million to $4.75 millionannually. The payments would go to a youthactivities account. The remainder of the loan would be for- given, provided the team can reach an agree-ment with the Minnesota Amateur SportsCommission to open the arena to the publicfor free events each year. Under the initial proposal presented by the governor and included in the House versionof the bill, the state was to provide a $65million grant to fund the arena. Under the new plan, the Minnesota Wild will not pay the $35 million in constructioncosts required by the previous lease. Instead,the team is required to pay the city $3.5 mil-lion in rent annually. The team remains responsible for the daily maintenance of the facility over the period ofthe lease and retains all revenue generatedfrom the facility, including the ticket sur-charge and outdoor marquee revenue origi-nally slated to go to the city. The new plan also removes the team's ex- emption from property tax, requiring that theteam make a payment in lieu of tax that isbased on revenue recouped by the team fromthe ticket surcharge and the outdoormarquee. Initially, the city would have been requiredto issue bonds in the amount of $30 million, which would have put the city at its maximumdebt capacity. The debt would have been ser-viced by revenues from the $1 ticket surchargeand the outdoor marquee, and by an existinghalf-cent sales tax. The new proposal would require the city to cover the remaining $65 million in construc-tion costs for the facility. The additional debtwould be serviced by the rent payments andpayments made in lieu of property taxes by theteam. Proponents of the plan say that the arena is just a part of a larger plan to revitalize theentire RiverCentre facility and downtownSt. Paul. They say that the expansion of theentire facility will mean new jobs and eco-nomic development in the area. Aside from professional hockey, this year's bonding bill focuses on transportation, highereducation, environment, and economic de-velopment projects statewide. If approved by the governor in its current form, the $999 million proposal would be thelargest bonding appropriation in state history.The bonding bill passed in 1994 holds thecurrent record at $711 million. This year's bonding bill is also unusual in that it would pay for over 50 percent of theamount with cash from the general fund asopposed to bonding for the entire amount. Proponents of this approach argued that it would be better to finance these improve-ments without placing the debt burden onfuture generations. Here are some other highlights of the capi- tal improvement bill. Light rail transit and transportation The prospect of a light rail transit (LRT)system in the Twin Cities moves closer to reality with the bonding bill, which wouldprovide $46.5 million toward transit-way de-velopment. The bill would provide $40 million of this amount to build a transportation line fromdowntown Minneapolis to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the Mall ofAmerica. The line is being called the HiawathaAvenue Corridor. The state's contribution would be matched with federal transit capital funds that shouldbe made available by Congress. The remaining $6.5 million for LRT in the bonding proposal would be used to studyexpansion of the LRT into St. Paul and othercorridors and to study commuter raildevelopment. LRT typically serves urban-suburban mar- kets with short distances between stations.Commuter rail primarily serves the suburbanmarket, typically providing links from outly-ing areas to the LRT. Commuter rail usesexisting rail lines and is characterized by longerstation-to-station distances of approximately2.5 miles. The bill would appropriate $5 million to assist in developing rural transit. Transit sys-tems in Duluth, Mankato, and St. Cloud wouldalso receive funds, under this provision. The bill also would appropriate $34 million for the construction and repair of Minnesotabridges. Transportation officials told lawmak-ers that bridges are deteriorating faster thanexpected because of unprecedented use byheavier vehicles and because of a change inconstruction methods 40 years ago. Of Minnesota's 19,790 bridges, 3,460 are deficient by federal standards, according tothe transportation department. A total of 573 A record $999 million bonding bill approved by the Legislature would provide money to construct a light rail transit line \u2014 res embling the San Diego system shown here \u2014 to link downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.7 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYof those are on the trunk highway system, and 2,887 are on local road systems. Higher education spending The largest portion of the bonding bill \u2014 $281.4 million \u2014 would go to improvementsto the state's higher education facilities. Ofthat amount, the University of Minnesotawould receive $138.3 million for projects acrossthe state. The Twin Cities campus would receive fund- ing for several improvements, including $53.6million for the Walter Library, $1.3 millionfor renovations to Amundson Hall, $4 millionfor biology laboratories Gortner and Snyderhalls, and $6.9 million for improvements toPeters Hall. Other projects in the university system in- clude $28.2 million for improvements to thescience and mathematics facility at the Morriscampus, $22.3 million for the construction ofa new library at the Duluth campus, and $4.4million for university-operated agriculturestations statewide. The Minnesota State Colleges and Univer- sities system would receive $143.1 million forstatewide improvements, mil-lion at the North Hennepin Community Col-lege, $10 million the St. Paul TechnicalCollege, $16 million at Hibbing Communityand Technical College, and $43 million tofund asset preservation at several systemfacilities. K-12 education projects The Department of Children, Families and Learning would receive $62.4 million forprojects, under the bill. Of that amount, $5 million would go to Youth Enrichment Grants. Communitiescould apply for the funds to develop after-school community facilities. Also from this amount, $14 million would go to a grant to the St. Paul School District toassist in the development of communityschools. The bill would also provide $9.2 million for the renovation of facilities at the state acad-emies for the deaf and blind in Faribault, andwould allocate $1.4 million to the Lola andRudy Perpich Center for Arts Education forimprovements. Recreation and conservation The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would receive nearly $130.3 millionfor a myriad of projects, including $10.3 mil-lion to acquire and maintain state trails and$17 million for improvements to the statepark system. Other projects overseen by the DNR wouldAlcohol sales on campus The sale of alcohol on state univer-sity grounds will be allowed on alimited basis, under a new statelaw. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, a provi- sion in the law will allow issuance of temporary on-sale liquor licenses for eventssponsored or approved by the university re-questing the permit. The law will not apply tocampus sporting events, fraternity or sororityparties, or other functions geared towardstudents. Legislators were told the permits will be for social functions at universities, such as playsheld on campus, where wine sales have beenrequested. The temporary licenses also couldbe used for on-campus alumni functions. Legislators also were told that community functions are sometimes held on campusesand that some civic organizations have re-quested to serve liquor on campus. Effective April 7, 1998, another new provi- sion allows on-sale liquor licenses to be issuedfor Giants Ridge Golf and Ski Resort and forIronworld Discovery Center. A state agency,the Iron Range Resources and RehabilitationBoard, owns and operates Ironworld inChisholm, Minn., and Giants Ridge nearBiwabik, Minn. The fee charged for a license issued for Ironworld or Giants Ridge must be comparableto the fee charged in the surrounding area. Also effective April 7, 1998, the law exempts towns of 5,000 or less from a restriction thatallows the sale of only one temporary licenseto a municipality within a 30-day period. Theexemption also applies to licenses issued inconnection with community festivals. Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) and Sen. Sam Solon (DFL-Duluth) sponsored thenew measure.

The Board of Soil and Water Resources would receive $19.8 million. Of that figure,$15 million would target wetlands for protec-tion under the Reinvest in Minnesota pro-gram. Under the program, landowners arepaid to retire certain lands from agriculturalproduction or place wetlands intoconservation. State buildings The bonding bill contains several appro- priations which seek to maintain the state'sstock of buildings. The Department of Administration would be appropriated $15 million to fund the Capi-tal Asset Preservation and Replacement Ac-count (CAPRA). The CAPRA account is usedto finance urgent and necessary improvements,such as elimination of hazardous materials oremergency repairs. The department also would receive money for other state facilities, including $3.8 million toconstruct a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion building, $5.4 for relocation of the Depart-ment of Revenue to its new facility in the Capitolcomplex, and $3.1 million to relocate workersfrom the troubled Capitol Square Building. The bonding bill also would appropriate $9.5 million to the Capitol Area Architecturaland Planning Board for improvements at thestate Capitol. Convention centers Consistent with the governor's proposal, convention centers also receive a good deal ofattention in the bonding bill. Along with theSt. Paul RiverCentre, the city of Minneapoliswould receive $87 million to help finance theexpansion of the Minneapolis ConventionCenter. Duluth would receive $10 million for the expansion of the Duluth Entertainment andConvention Center. Other convention centerfunding would be provided to the cities ofFergus Falls, Hutchinson, Rochester, andSt. Cloud.Signed by the governor Business on Sundays A new law makes it easier forMinnesota's boat, snowmobile,and all-terrain vehicle dealers todo business on Sundays. Previously, boat, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle trailers were considered \"motor vehicles\" under state law,which prohibits the sale of motor vehicles onSundays. That meant customers without theirown trailer had no way to transport theirpurchases on Sundays.Signed by the governor8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Effective March 6, 1998, the new law fixed the impractical glitch in state law by exempt-ing certain trailers from the Sunday sales ban. A second provision in the new law also aims to make life easier for trailer dealers. Prior to the passage of the law, it was neces- sary for an individual to hold a franchise li-cense in order to sell a motor vehicle. The newlaw exempts trailers from the franchiserequirement. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), spon- sor of the measure, was alerted to the prob-lems with trailer sales by a small marine dealerin his district. Originally, Anderson said, heconsidered doing away with the Sunday mo-tor vehicle sales ban entirely. But that idea opened a \"hornet's nest,\" he said. Some dealers support Sunday sales; manydo not. During a House committee hearing, Scott Lambert of the Minnesota Auto Dealers Asso-ciation, said that his organization has no prob-lem with exempting trailers from the Sundaysales ban, but the automobile dealers Lambertrepresents are not interested in doing regularbusiness on Sundays.

If the agree-ment contains no withdrawal authority, thelimited partner will not be able to withdraw. Current law allows limited partners to with- draw unless it is specifically forbidden in thewritten partnership agreement. Limited partners invest in a partnership but are usually not subject to the same legal liabili-ties to which the general partners are subject.

HF2507/SF3036*/CH320Franchise law exemption Northwest Airlines will be unableto use a 1997 law to its advantage ina court battle, under a new lawsigned by the governor. The 1997 Legislature passed spe- cial legislation for Northwest Air- lines that retroactively exempted the airlinefrom Minnesota's franchise law. The state franchise law provides franchisees with some degree of protection against un-warranted termination of agreements withtheir parent companies. Legislators discovered this year that the ret- roactive exemption had an effect on pendinglitigation against Northwest Airlines. A $30 million lawsuit filed in Maine in 1994 by Northeast Express Airlines and PrecisionValley Aviation claims that Northwest Air-lines violated Minnesota's franchise law whenit dropped the two commuter airlines, forcingthem into bankruptcy. The new law clarifies that the 1997 franchise exemption does not apply to any agreementsthat were subject to litigation prior to passageof the law. The new law is effective retroac-tively to May 31, 1997. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Allan Spear (DFL-Mpls) sponsored themeasure.

The House passed the billApril 9 on a 131-1 vote. Sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the bill ( HF2985*/SF2682 ) seeks to address issues that have recently come to lightregarding the state's ability to protect childrenwho are in danger. In January 1998, the legislative auditor re- leased an evaluation of the state's child protec-tion system. The auditor found that servicesvaried greatly from county to county and thatno external oversight exists to monitor theactions in these cases. The auditor suggestednumerous approaches to reforming the cur-rent state of the system. Entenza's bill incorporates many of the sug- gestions, along with changes recently man-dated by federal law. The bill would create amore uniform statewide system and attemptto provide a sufficient level of oversight tomake sure that the cases are handled effectively. The bill also seeks to place children more quickly into permanent living situations, ei-ther with a parent or another alternative home.In addition, the bill would require that theDepartment of Human Services design a state-wide child protective services plan with inputfrom the county-administered programs. The bill also would direct spending of a $10 million family preservation appropriationcontained in the omnibus health and humanservices bill ( HF2868/SF3346* ), which is Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls). Atotal of $9.3 million would go to the countiesto assist in permanent placement, and theremaining $700,000 would go to the Depart-ment of Human Services to assist in planningand coordination of the statewide system. Getting extended area service A new state law makes it easier topetition the Public Utilities Com-mission for extended telephone ser-vice within school districtboundaries. A 1997 law required a majority of all telephone customers in each exchange tovote in favor of extended area service within aschool district. The new measure, effective March 24, 1998, requires only that a majority of customerswho cast a vote is required to extend theservice. Extended area service is often sought in rural areas, where calls from residents to theirchildren's school can result in long distancecharges. While extended area service may re-sult in higher monthly service charges, it doesmake each call within a school district a localcall.

The program currently9 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYCRIME Signed by the governorprovides assistance for basic telephone serviceto about 50,000 Minnesotans who meet crite-ria related to age or disability. The bill wouldhave changed eligibility requirements to in-come-based criteria. The bill \"amounts to a tax increase,\" Carlson wrote in his veto message. \"This legislation will eventually increase TAP fees placed upon telephone customers by 66percent and impose a fee on cellular phones toincrease the fee base by 30 percent, thus givingrise to a tax increase of approximately $1million,\" the governor stated. \"Moreover, thislanguage nearly triples the size of the existingprogram.\" The bill would have allowed a surcharge on cellular phones, but the surcharge would havebeen capped at 10 cents a month on cellular,business, and residential lines. The surchargewould not have applied to telephone pagers. Currently, there is a 6-cent monthly sur- charge on regular telephone accounts to fi-nance the program. The proposed new version of the TAP would have included no reference to age or disabilityin eligibility requirements. The bill would havebroadened the program to include single-per-son households at or below 100 percent of thefederal poverty level and multiple-personhouseholds at or below 150 percent of thelevel. \"I have long opposed legislation which re- sults in new or increased taxes,\" Carlson wrote.\"My position has not changed.\" Rep.

One such provision in the new law will classify murder committed in thecourse of a kidnapping a heinous crime, effec-tive Aug. 1, 1998. A person convicted of sucha crime could be sentenced to life withoutparole, Minnesota's toughest sentence.(Art. 2, Sec. 6) Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), who backed the provision, said that measure comesin response to the 1996 murder-kidnapping ofPaul Antonich, a Two Harbors teen-ager in Duluth after a minortraffic accident.Another provision in the new law will make murder committed during a drive-by shoot-ing a first-degree murder crime, increasingthe prison sentence for the offense.(Art. 2, Sec. 7) The new law also will raise the maximum penalty from a five-year prison term to a 10-year term for firing into an occupied vehicle.Both drive-by shooting provisions are effec-tive Aug. 1, 1998. (Art. 2, Sec. 22) The measure also will increase penalties for felons convicted of violent offenses who arefound illegally in possession of a firearm. Cur-rently, the mandatory minimum prison sen-tence is 18 months. Effective Jan. 1, 1999, themandatory minimum will be increased to fiveyears. (Art. 2, Sec. 4) Another provision in the law will increase penalties generally for soliciting a prostituteor receiving profit from prostitution. Thisprovision, effective Aug. 1, 1998, also willincrease the penalties for engaging in prosti-tution in a school zone or in a residential area.(Art. 2, Secs. 1, 12) Rep.

HFnone/SF3345*/CH367 Prosecuting gangs Prosecutors told legislators this year that they are having difficulties bringing gang mem-bers to trial and making the penalties stick.Several provisions in the new law seek to ad-dress such concerns. One provision will expand a current law that provides increased penalties for crimesdone for the benefit of a gang to include crimes \"motivated by involvement with\" a gang. Theprovision also will increase these enhancedpenalties. (Art. 2, Sec. 9) The new law will increase penalties for wit- ness tampering and will add witness tamper-ing to the list of crimes that can receiveenhanced penalties if done for the benefit of agang. (Art. 2, Sec. 5) The measure also seeks to get people to show up for court, both offenders and wit-nesses. One provision will increase the penaltyfor failure to appear in court if charged with afelony level crime. (Art. 2, Sec. 16) Another provision will increase penalties for individuals who knowingly and willinglydefy a court subpoena to appear in relation toa violent crime. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) These provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Charging burglars A provision of the new law will make it easier to prosecute people who illegally enter aproperty by expanding the definition of bur-glary to include accomplices. The new defini-tion is effective Aug. 1, 1998. (Art. 2, Sec. 21) Prosecutors said the new language would make the law more explicit and allow them tobring charges against anyone who illegallyenters a dwelling, even if they don't actuallybreak in or steal something. Fighting drugs The new law will increase the penalties for manufacturing, possessing, or selling meth-amphetamine. Law enforcement officials saidthat Minnesota is seeing a dramatic increase inuse of the drug. A new law will increase penalties for a number of crimes, including prostitution and drive-by shootings.10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the drug will be raised to the same status as cocaine and heroin andthe manufacture of any amount of metham-phetamine will be a first-degree controlledsubstance offense.

The targeted over-the-counterproducts containing ephedrine are reportedlytaken by teen-agers and others looking toachieve a legal high. (Art. 4, Secs. 5, 6) Protecting police officers Several provisions in the new law seek to make it easier and safer for police officers to dotheir jobs. One such provision comes as a result of an incident where two Richfield police officerswere accused of sexual assault. Although theallegations were proven false, the incidentgreatly disrupted the criminal justice process,not to mention the lives of the two officers. The provision will make it a criminal viola- tion to harass police officers because of theperformance of official duties by expandingthe state's stalking law. (Art. 2, Sec. 23) In addition, the new law will make it easier to prosecute people who interfere with offic-ers making an arrest by expanding the legaldefinition of obstruction of justice.(Art. 2, Sec. 17) The two provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Another provision, effective April 7, 1998, authorizes officers to conduct pat-downsearches on juveniles taken into custody. Under previous law, pat-down searches could be performed only on adult offenders.Proponents of the change argued that policeofficers need to be protected from juveniles, aswell as adults, carrying concealed weapons.(Art. 10, Sec. 10) Conditional release Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law will make several changes to the state's probationand conditional release law. The measure also will allow peace officers to detain for eight hours a person on conditionalrelease if the officer has reasonable cause tobelieve that the individual has violated theterms of his or her release. (Art. 7, Sec. 12) The law also allows probation officers to impose community service on people whoviolate the conditions of their parole.(Art. 7, Secs. 1, 2) The new law also authorizes the use of re- mote electric alcohol monitoring for offend-ers who agree to abstain from alcohol as acondition for pretrial release or probation.Offenders who can afford the program are required to pay the costs. (Art. 11, Sec. 6) Juvenile criminals A version of the legislation earlier approved by the House would have opened some juve-nile court records and proceedings to the pub-lic. For juveniles under 14 years old, the billwould have made court records available tothe public if the juvenile was found guilty of athird felony or gross misdemeanor level of-fense. For juveniles who are 14 years old orolder, the bill would have opened all courthearings to the public, regardless of theoffense. These provisions were removed by the con- ference committee. However, juvenile courtproceedings and documents will be open tothe victim of the crime, under the new law.(Art. 10, Secs. 7, 8) The measure also will increase penalties for contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.Another provision will create a civil penaltyfor this crime, requiring a person found liablefor the delinquency of a juvenile to providerestitution to victims. (Art. 10, Secs. 11, 12) The new law also will make it easier to get juveniles who are participating in prostitutioninto the state's child protection system.(Art. 10, Secs. 4-6) These provisions are effective Aug. 1, 1998. Right to ride A provision of the new law will prohibit owners of public accommodations, such asrestaurants and hotels, from discriminatingagainst motorcyclists. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law provides exceptions if the owner feels that the person'sconduct poses a risk to property or the safetyof other patrons, or if the clothing worn by themotorcyclist is obscene or includes the sym-bol of a criminal gang. (Art. 11, Sec. 18) Reporting crime Several provisions within the new law au- thorize reports to the Legislature regardingcrime in Minnesota. One provision requests that the legislative auditor study the cost of crime in the state,including direct costs to state and local gov-ernments for criminal justice and indirect costsplaced on individuals, businesses, andneighborhoods. (Art. 1, Sec. 14) Another measure authorizes the city of Min- neapolis, Hennepin County, and the HennepinCounty District Court to provide data oncriminal justice in the city of Minneapolis.This study must be approved by both theMinneapolis City Council and the HennepinCounty Board. (Art. 2, Sec. 29)Another provision seeks more accurate in- formation on prostitution in Minneapolis andSt. Paul. The new law mandates that city attor-neys in the two cities and county attorneys inHennepin and Ramsey counties report oninvestigation and prosecution of prostitutionwithin the jurisdictions. (Art. 2, Secs. 30-31) Financing justice The measure contains $7.9 million in supple- mental appropriations, a majority of whichwill go to the Department of Corrections, theDepartment of Public Safety, and the statecourts. Of the total amount, $3 million will be recouped in revenue from increased criminaljustice fees and criminal fines. The Department of Corrections will receive $2.1 million, much of which will go to reduc-ing the caseload for probation officers. Grantprograms that fund community correctionsalso will be funded through these dollars. The Department of Public Safety will be appropriated $1.6 million. Of these funds, theoffice of the Crime Victim Ombudsman willreceive $300,000 to fund its services; theBureau of Criminal Apprehension will receive$133,000 to add forensic scientists to its crimelab; and the department will get $750,000 forlaw enforcement and community crime pre-vention grants.

In his veto message, the governor restated his belief that the even-year legislative sessionshould focus on bonding and emergencyissues. \"As I stated in my prior veto message, even- year legislative sessions were not created toenact large appropriation bills such as this,\"Carlson wrote. \"Outside of bonding and emer-gency financing, the Legislature should sig-nificantly limit all spending proposals duringthese sessions.\" The governor said that the bill contained several worthwhile appropriations whichshould be revisited by the Legislature, includ-ing funds to the Department of EconomicDevelopment for a vocational rehabilitationprogram and appropriations for various hous-ing programs. A last-minute attempt to get a scaled-back jobs, housing and economic development billto the governor's desk failed April 9. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) and Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) sponsored an amend-ment to add many of the appropriations con-tained in the vetoed bill to a separate bill(HF2034/SF90* ), sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia). The amendment contained $2.7 million in appropriations for housing programs and$10.4 million in appropriations for economicdevelopment and job training. The amendment was added to the bill. How- ever, the bill did not come up for a vote beforethe final adjournment. Trimble and Sen. Tracy Beckman (DFL- Bricelyn) sponsored the vetoed omnibus jobs,housing, and economic development bill. The vetoed bill included a provision that would have provided $10 million to the Min-nesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) toassist in maintaining existing low-incomehousing. That provision was the centerpieceof the $20 million housing portion of the bill. The provision was in response to a situation occurring statewide. In the 1970s, the federalgovernment set up a program where develop-ers received reduced-rate mortgages and fi-nancing incentives to build low- andmoderate-income housing. Rent rates weresubsidized by the federal government and rentincreases were regulated. Owners of many such complexes are now taking advantage of a provision that allowsthem to prepay the remaining portion of theirmortgage and to begin charging market-raterent. The $10 million in the bill would have funded the equity takeout loan program ad-ministered by the MHFA. The fund is used toprovide financial incentives to maintain exist- ing subsidized housing. The incentives can bemade available to local units of governmentand nonprofit organizations. And the bill included $9 million in appro- priations to the Department of Economic Se-curity for job training and assistance, including$3.2 million for summer youth employmentand $1.4 million for the State Services for theBlind to develop a digital communication cen-ter for its Radio Talking Book program. The bill would have appropriated $6.2 mil- lion to the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development for statewide projects.Of that amount, $3.3 million would have goneto the Minnesota Film Board to provide sup-port for the state's $250 million film and videoindustry. The appropriation would have been used to create a revolving loan film fund to be admin-istered by the film board and the Departmentof Trade and Economic Development. HF3806/SF3367*/CH374 DWIEDUCATIONSCHOOL Signed by the governorRepeat DWI offenders Effective March 26, 1998, a newlaw authorizes state courts to sen-tence repeat DWI offenders to anintensive probation program inplace of mandatory jail sentences. Intensive probation programs seek to provide alternative sentencing for thoseDWI offenders considered to be of high risk tothe community. These programs require a period of incar- ceration in a treatment facility followed bysupervised home detention. Offenders areprohibited from using alcohol or drugs andare frequently tested for use throughout theprobation. Offenders are also required to paya substantial portion of program costs. The Department of Corrections has a grant program in place to assist counties interestedin establishing intensive probation programs.Correction officials said that they receivedrequests from 13 counties this year. Officials from Dakota County said that an evaluation of their intensive probation pro-gram showed a recidivism rate of 11 percent.They said the rate for those incarcerated with-out the program was 43 percent. The officials said it is difficult to get a repeat offender into the program voluntarily after heor she has already done jail time. Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon-sored the legislation. HF2615/SF2252*/CH332K-12 education finance bill The state's Graduation Standards would stay, the State Board of Education would go,superintendents' paychecks could grow, andMinnesota's special-education system wouldsee a major overhaul, under the K-12 educa-tion finance bill the House passed April 9. The bulk of the funding \u2014 $70 million of the bill's total $124 million \u2014 would go tohelp districts implement the Profile of Learn-ing, a portion of the state's Graduation Stan-dards initiative that would measure studentachievement on a broad range of skills. Although the Profile of Learning is cur- rently set to kick in with the 1998-1999 schoolyear, the bill would allow districts to phase inthe requirements over the next three years. Allstudents graduating in 2002 would be requiredto have completed the new standards. \"Our goal was to make sure the Graduation Standards are able to work, and to move downa path that will result in kids being betterprepared for the world,\" said Rep. Becky Kelso(DFL-Shakopee), who sponsored the bill(HF2874*/SF3378 ) in the House. She also noted that, being the second year of the legislative biennium, 1998 is \"not a yearfor dramatic changes or reform.\" Nevertheless, the bill carries a major policy change, calling for abolishing the 79-year-oldState Board of Education by 2000. The nine-member board helps set rules and policies for K-12 and community education.Under the bill, most of the board's authoritywould be transferred to the commissioner ofthe Department of Children, Families andLearning, but a new board would be created totake over regulating the state academies forthe deaf and blind in Faribault. Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the legislation in the Senate. Thegovernor has said he plans to sign the bill. Special education The state's special education system also would receive a major overhaul under theomnibus bill. A 1997 report of the legislative auditor showed that special education costs in Minne-sota were spiraling, and Kelso has said thatgetting those costs under control was a highpriority for this session. The bill would require the state to reim- burse districts for 50 percent of certain legalcosts incurred when schools attempt to denyparents' requests for what the schools perceiveas unnecessary special education services. Thetheory is that districts often provide12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998unnecessary, costly services because they are afraid of the potential cost of lawsuits \u2014 evenunsuccessful ones \u2014 brought by parents ask-ing for services. But before they would be eligible for reim- bursement, districts would first have to makea \"good faith effort\" to resolve the disputethrough mediation. In another attempt to cut costs, the bill would mandate that as of July 1, 1999, statespecial education requirements could not ex-ceed federal requirements. The bill also contains provisions that would maximize Medical Assistance reimbursementsfor special education purposes. The bulk of the bill's special education pro- visions were the result of a year-long jointHouse and Senate subcommittee, headed byRep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville). Superintendents' salaries The current cap \u2014 at 95 percent of the governor's annual paycheck \u2014 on Minnesotaschool superintendents' salaries also would berepealed under the bill. Several metropolitan-area districts have said they've had trouble recruiting and retainingtop-notch superintendents because of the sal-ary cap. \"It simply makes no sense for the state of Minnesota to be involved in something of thatlocal nature,\" Kelso said. Boarding schools Gov. Arne resi- dential boarding academies for at-risk youthis also supported in the bill. The measure calls for $12 million to help build three year-round schools.The proposed year-round academies would be geared to high school students who areunsuccessfully bounced between foster fami-lies or those whose parents feel a residentialenvironment would help get their child on theright track. Enrollment would be conditionalupon the students' voluntary desire to attend. All-day kindergarten The bill also would provide an additional $1.5 million for certain schools to begin orcontinue all-day kindergarten programs. The new funds would bring next year's al- lowance for the first-grade preparedness pro-gram, initiated in 1996, up to $6.5 million.Kindergarten is still optional in Minnesota,but several recent reports have shown thatattending all-day programs dramatically in-creases children's academic and social skills. The House version of the omnibus bill that went to conference committee would haveadded only $500,000 in new funds for thisprogram, but the Senate version would haveadded $5 million. Loophole closed Another provision would clarify a murky area of state statute under which some dis-tricts have been able to substitute locally ap-proved achievement tests for state-mandatedtests. Under the bill, all districts would be re- quired to use the same tests for assessing stu-dents' basic skills aptitudes. Summer school Attending summer school could become mandatory for some students under the newbill.Districts would have the authority to set their own criteria for determining who wouldbe required to attend summer programs. Theprovision is intended to help districts improveperformances on the state-mandated basicskills tests. Earlier start dates Under the bill, districts would also be al- lowed to begin the school year as early asSeptember 1. Current law prohibits schools from starting before Labor Day, and an earlier provision torepeal the mandated start date altogether washeavily opposed by members of the tourismindustry, who were concerned about poten-tial lost revenue in a shortened summerseason. Last year, lawmakers passed a measure al- lowing an exception to the Labor Day schoolstart law to allow schools to begin classesbefore the holiday in 1998 and 1999. Charter school sponsors A current ban on corporate sponsorship of charter schools would be repealed under thebill. Currently, only public school districtsand public or private colleges and universitiescan sponsor a state charter school. Kelso said the provision was added at the request of the governor, who \"felt strongly\"that businesses should be allowed to sponsorthe schools. A $124 million K-12 education bill that passed the Legislature would provide funds to support all-daykindergarten and would allow secondary schools to phase in the Profile of Learning, which is a part ofthe state's Graduation Standards initiative. Elections provisions modified A new law changes the standard forconviction of people who distrib-ute false material during an elec-tion campaign. Under previous law, people who distributed false material or made a false statement about a candidate or a ballotquestion could have been convicted of a grossmisdemeanor. Now, to be convicted, the person making the statement has to know the material is falseor has to have failed to check on it adequately.The law was drafted to conform with a U.S.Supreme Court decision. To conform with a separate state district court decision, the new law also restores thevoting rights of those judged legally incompe-tent because they are considered sexually dan-gerous or psychopathic. Under previous law,they could not vote. The new law, which took effect April 10, 1998, was sponsored by Rep. MindyELECTIONS Signed by the governor13 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYGreiling (DFL-Roseville) and Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville). HF2486/SF2256*/CH376 EMPLOYMENTVetoed by the governor Vetoed by the governor Vetoed by the governorVetoed by the governorUpdating voter lists Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billthat aimed to make it easier forpeople who move to new homesto update their voter registrationinformation. The bill would have authorized the Office of the Secretary of State to get names and ad-dresses of people who have given the U.S.Postal Service a change-of-address card. The bill called for the secretary of state to then send the information to the appropriatecounty auditor and for the auditor to confirmthe voter's new address by mail. In his veto message, the governor said he vetoed similar legislation in 1997 and that hestill has the same concerns. He then listedthose concerns as follows: \"1) Where a personreceives their mail is not necessarily alwayswhere they reside and vote; 2) Establishing theresidence of thousands of potential voters is aculmination of many factors that may notalways be reflected by an automatic processfor registration; and 3) The unintended out-come of this process may actually be moreconfusion on the part of the electorate,\" hewrote. Carlson said any change in election law is important and should have bipartisan sup-port. The bill passed 71-61 in the House and46-14 in the Senate. \"Even if my concerns were entirely satisfied, I could not support any changes to our elec-tion laws when only three Republican mem-bers in the House of Representatives, andrelatively few in the Senate, supported the bill.Changes such as those proposed in this billshould have at least modest bipartisan sup-port before becoming law,\" he wrote. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) spon-sored the bill. HF2387/SF2149*/CH346 Open absentee balloting Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billthat would have extended RamseyCounty's open absentee ballotprogram. In his veto message, Carlson questioned the need for its continuation. \"The project has been in existence since 1991,\" he wrote. \"At what point do we bring apilot project to an end? What information, other than what has already been gathered,does the county hope to obtain? And what does the county intend to do when the projectexpires in two years? We know what the ben-efits and drawbacks of this program are \u2014 it'stime to end it and take up the larger debate ofapplying it to all citizens of the state.\" In 1991, Anoka, Hennepin, Polk, and Ramsey counties entered into a pilot projectfor open absentee balloting. The 1994 Legisla-ture extended the pilot project in RamseyCounty until this year. Under the pilot project, people don't need a reason to vote absentee, they just need toapply in writing at their county auditor's of-fice. (State law dictates that people who wantto vote by absentee ballot must have an ac-ceptable reason, such as absence from theprecinct, illness, disability, observance of areligious holiday, or service as an electionjudge.) An absentee ballot is mailed or given to the voter, who fills it out like a regular ballot andmails it to the county auditor's office. Theballots are held until election day, then countedwith the rest of the ballots. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul)sponsored the bill. HF2567/HF2221*/CH347 Absentee ballots with 'reason' Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a billthat would have allowed voters touse an absentee ballot for anyreason. Current law lists a number of acceptable reasons for voting by an absenteeballot. The reasons include absence from theprecinct, illness, disability, observance of areligious holiday, or election judge service inanother precinct. The bill would have stricken that language in current law and required only that voterslist their reason for needing an absentee balloton their application. In his veto message, Carlson said he was concerned about the party-line vote on thebill. \"Significant changes to election laws such as those proposed in this bill are too importantto be entirely one-sided and lacking in bipar-tisanship,\" Carlson wrote. The bill was widely opposed by Republican legislators. \"Changes should have at least modest sup- port from both sides of the aisle before beingsigned into law, and certainly not the vocifer-ous opposition that accompanied this andother election law bills,\" Carlson wrote. Rep. Tom (DFL-Brooklyn Park) spon- sored the bill. HF2526/SF2148*/CH352 Absentee voting pilot project A bill that would have establishedan absentee ballot pilot projectfor Hennepin County was vetoedby Gov. Arne Carlson. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), called for apilot project that would have allowed voters tovote by absentee ballot without having to givea reason, as long as they supply their name,address, signature, and other basicinformation. It's the fourth bill relating to election law that Carlson has vetoed this year, including abill that would have extended a similar absen-tee ballot pilot project in Ramsey County, andhe noted that in his veto message. \"What do we hope to learn from the Minne- apolis project that was not demonstrated inRamsey County? We know what the benefitsand drawbacks of an open ballot system are \u2014if it is a good idea, then take it statewide,\" hewrote. Under present law, people wanting to vote absentee must have a reason, such as an ill-ness, disability, observance of a religious holi-day, or service as an election judge. Carlson noted that changes to election law are too important to be \"laced with partisan-ship. I cannot support changes to our electionlaws when not a single Republican in the House,and relatively few in the Senate, supported thebill,\" he wrote. \"Increasing voter turnout, especially in our large cities, is an admirable goal; but simplify-ing the process is only a very small part of thesolution. Issues and candidates move peopleto vote. I suggest we focus on those criticalparts to move the citizens of Minneapolis tothe polls,\" Carlson concluded. Jefferson and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill. HF2293/SF2118*/CH370 Signed by the governorHibbing workers' benefits About 125 workers, temporarilylaid off from the Hibbing TaconiteCo. in St. Louis County, may re-ceive extended re-employmentbenefits, under a new measureGov. Arne Carlson allowed to be- come law without his signature. Effective April 7, 1998, the workers became14 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Signed by the governoreligible for up to an additional 13 weeks ofbenefits. They were laid off between July and September 1997 because of lack of work. Thecompany says it expects to have them back towork by the end of May, but the workers'regular unemployment benefits ran out overthe winter. Under previous law, extended benefits were granted only to workers affected by large,permanent layoffs in counties with highunemployment. The new law exempts the Hibbing workers from three requirements: that the layoff be ofa certain size, that it be permanent, and that itoccur in a county where the unemploymentrate is more than 10 percent. The workers stillneed to meet requirements specifying thatthey be otherwise eligible for unemploymentand that they have exhausted all other rights tobenefits. Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm) said the average benefit of the affected workersis $331 per month and the total extra benefitswill be about $128,000. He also said that thecompany, since it is still in business, will endup paying for most of that amount in taxes. Tomassoni and Sen. Jerry Janezich (DFL- Chisholm) sponsored the legislation. HF3465/SF3084*/CH358 Workplace breast-feeding Employers be required to makea \"reasonable effort\" to provide ad-equate private space and unpaidbreaks for new mothers to pumpbreast milk, under a new law signedby the governor April 9. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, employers must pro- vide \"a room or other location, in close prox-imity to the work area, other than a toiletstall,\" where a woman can privately pumpbreast milk. But employers will not be held liable if they have made a \"reasonable effort\" to comply,and the law does not contain penalties. The law will stipulate the break times can run concurrently with any other providedbreaks. Employers will not have to provide thebreaks if doing so would \"unduly disrupt theoperations of the employer.\" The law also will exempt breast-feeding from indecent exposure laws. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) and Sen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St. Paul) spon-sored the legislation. HF3459/SF2751*/CH369Emergency dispatcher status Emergency dispatchers will be clas-sified as essential employees, un-der a new law. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, police, fire, and 911 dispatchers will join lawenforcement personnel, health care workers, prison guards, and others as essentialemployees. Under that status, workers give up the right to strike, but they can still request arbitrationin a labor dispute. Supporters of the new measure said it was needed because a dispatchers' strike wouldthreaten public safety. Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) spon-sored the legislation. HF1693/SF1074*/CH355 ENVIRONMENTSigned by the governorJoanne a lactation specialist at theMinnesota Department of Health, informedlawmakers about the benefits of breast milk forinfants. She backed a new law that will requireemployers to provide reasonable unpaid breaktime and a private space for nursing mothers topump breast milk. Environmental spending A $17.2 million environment, natural re- sources, and agriculture spending bill wonfinal passage in the House April 9. The billawaits action by the governor. Originally, the House had rejected compro- mise language adopted by a House-Senateconference committee. Bill sponsor Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) said he was unable torenegotiate the deal because the Senate re-fused to return to conference committee. \"This bill hasn't changed at all, except it just sat there for six days,\" said Rep. Phil Krinkie(R-Shoreview). But, with the threat of the 1998 Legislative Session ending without an environmentalspending package, the bill finally passed on a72-60 vote. Here's a look at some of the key provisions of the bill ( HF3799/SF3353* ). Living with livestock Most notably, the House-approved mora- torium on new construction or expansion offeedlots at the level of 750 animal units was notadopted by the House-Senate conferencecommittee. The bill would, however, prohibit the issu- ance of permits to construct or expand clay,earthen, or flexible membrane (plastic-lined)swine waste lagoons until June 30, 2000. \"This bill is very important to rural Minne- sota and the environmental community andit's a start down to the path to improvements,\"said Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison). After March 1, 2000, those who commer- cially manage and apply animal wastes wouldhave to hold valid animal waste technicianlicenses issued by the Department of Agricul-ture. Most family farmers would be exemptfrom the provision. The bill would clarify the power of counties to adopt feedlot ordinances that are morestringent than those of the Minnesota Pollu-tion Control Agency (MPCA). The agency would be authorized to deny permits to feedlot operators who are lackingadequate experience or who have bad envi-ronmental records in other states. Personal watercraft Under the bill, personal watercraft owners would pay a $50 surcharge every three yearsfor a watercraft license. The proceeds wouldbe divided between the state and counties forlaw enforcement and education efforts. The conference committee did not adopt House language that would have prohibitedthe use of a personal watercraft in one placefor more than 30 minutes, nor did the confer-ence committee choose to instruct the De-partment of Natural Resources (DNR) toconduct a study on the impact of personalwatercraft on loons. Snowmobile studs Under another provision of the omnibus bill, no snowmobile with a track equippedwith metal studs could be operated on any15 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYpublic lands, roads, or trails after July 1, 1999. Current law prohibits the use of studs onpaved public trails. Although many claim that studs make for safer riding, proponents of the measure saypaved trails are being destroyed by studs de-spite the current law. Until the total stud ban takes effect, the bill would place a $50 annual surcharge on snow-mobiles with studs. Fees from the surchargewould be earmarked for the repair of pavedstate trails. Under the bill, an individual who violates the stud ban on paved public trails would havehis or her snowmobile confiscated after thesecond or subsequent violation. Many House members opposed the forfei- ture provision. \"We don't want to forfeit our snowmobiles just because we ride over a couple of patches oftar,\" said Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka). Osthoff, who chairs the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Fi-nance Committee, promised to revisit theforfeiture provision next year. Minnesota Zoo shortfall The Minnesota Zoological Gardens would receive $1.5 million for operating costs tomake up for a serious shortfall in gate receiptslast summer. The Apple Valley zoo was forced to ask the Legislature for help after experiencing a stringof bad luck, bad weather, and bad press,Kathryn Roberts, the zoo's director, saidduring an earlier House committee hearing. The bill would require the zoo to address its attendance forecasting methods to avoid asimilar problem in the future.Deformed frogs The MPCA would receive $375,000 for re- search into the cause of deformities found infrogs across the state. The money would haveto be shared with the University of Minnesota,Hamline University, and the state departmentsof health, agriculture, and natural resources. Currently, researchers are speculating that groundwater contamination or possible ul-traviolet radiation may be the cause of thedeformities. The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency also has begun to examine theissue. Gypsy moths Under the bill, the Department of Agriculture's gypsy moth trapping and eradi-cation program would be allocated $360,000. The money would supplement the biologi- cal control program and allow for more fieldpersonnel to trap the leaf-eating insects. Minnesota grown The bill would appropriate $267,000 for a pilot project to expand Minnesota Grown, acoupon program designed to provide nutri-tious food to low-income families and pro-mote locally grown products. Critics haveclaimed that redeeming the coupons is con-fusing because many grocers are unfamiliarwith the foods that qualify. Timber wolf depredation The bill would increase from $400 to $750 per animal the amount of compensation avail-able to farmers whose livestock are killed bywolves. Farmers would have to establish tim-ber wolf best management systems to qualifyfor compensation.Helping hog farmers Market Champ Inc. a nonprofit corpora- tion that transfers high quality genetic mate-rial from the University of Minnesota to familyfarmers across the state would receive$125,000. Helping dairy farmers Minnesota dairy farmers are currently en- gaged in a lawsuit against the federal govern-ment (Minnesota Milk Producers Association v. Glickman) to bring about reform of the fed- eral milk market pricing system. The bill would give the farmers another $100,000 in state money for the legal battle. Living snow fences The Board of Water and Soil Resources would receive $100,000 to fund a voluntaryprogram for landowners to plant and main-tain trees, shrubs, and grass strips alongsideroads in an effort to control drifting and blow-ing snow. Whitewater rafting on the Mississippi One provision included in the bill would explore the possibility of harnessing the waterpower of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis forrecreational pursuits. The DNR would receive $100,000 to con- duct engineering and hydraulic research intothe possible development of a whitewater parkfor kayaking, rafting, and canoeing at the falls. Tornado damage Five funnel clouds tore through 5,300 acres of sparsely populated forests in Morrison, MilleLacs, Kanabec, and Crow Wing counties onSept. 18, 1997, leaving a path of destruction25 miles long and three-quarters of a milewide. The DNR would receive $75,000 for grants to assist landowners with reforestation efforts,under the bill. An environment and natural resources bill passed by the Legislature would take some steps to addressproblems related to animal feedlots. The measure would prohibit the issuance of permits to constructor expand clay, earthen, or plastic-lined swine waste lagoons until June 30, 2000. And the bill would setnew requirements for those who commercially manage and apply animal wastes.Personal watercraft regulation A bill that aims to regulate personal water- craft operation on Minnesota lakes won finalapproval in the House April 9. The vote was102-28. The bill, which was among the most contro- versial of the 1998 session, once included lan-guage that would have banned the operationof personal watercraft on lakes of 100 acres orless. The proposed ban was removed from thebill before it was sent to a House-Senate con-ference committee. The bill returned from conference commit- tee without a highly criticized citizen report-ing measure that would have allowedindividuals to lodge formal complaints against16 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998operators who violate personal watercraft laws. Peace officers could have then issued civilcitations to the owner of any personal water-craft that was the subject of a citizencomplaint. Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), who had been a vocal opponent of the 100-acre lakeban and civil complaint provisions, said billsponsor Rep. (DFL-Crosby)deserves the \"tenacity award\" for the session. \"I am delighted to finally stand up on this bill and support it,\" Weaver said. \"It makesgood sense now.\" Under the bill, personal watercraft opera- tion would be permitted only between9:30 a.m. and one hour before sunset. Currentlaw allows personal watercraft use between8 a.m. and sunset. The bill would add another 50 feet to the no-wake zone, making it illegal to operate apersonal watercraft at full speed within150 feet of shoreline, docks, swimmers, orother boats. However, it still would be permis-sible to pull water-skiers behind personalwatercraft. Another provision would prohibit the op- eration of personal watercraft while facingbackwards. Several provisions in the bill seek to make personal watercraft operation safer forteen-agers. One such provision would expand the state's youth watercraft safety course to include per-sonal watercraft. Completion of a personalwatercraft training program would be man-datory for 13- to 17-year-olds, and 13-year-old operators would have to remain underdirect visual supervision of an adult 21 years ofage or older.The bill also would require that personal watercraft purchasers and renters sign state-issued forms indicating they have read thelaws governing personal watercraft operation.Dealers and rental agents would have to keepthe forms on file for six months and allow foreasy access by law enforcement officers. The bill ( HF1351/SF1169* ) now goes to the governor. Transport packaging waste A new law aims to reduce theamount of transport packagingwaste that Minnesota's soft drinkindustry creates. In 1995, 22 percent of municipal solid waste consisted of transport packaging such as wood pallets and corru-gated cardboard, Rep. Willard Munger(DFL-Duluth), the House sponsor of the mea-sure, said during floor debate. The soft drink industry is considering a $15 million investment in reusable, recyclableplastic merchandise pallets to replace the woodpallets they currently use to transport theirgoods to retailers. The plastic pallets are expected to cost about $32 each, compared to $5 to $7 each for woodpallets. There is now a system in place where third parties collect used pallets from retail sites andthen resell them to soft drink companies. Dave Locey, of the Minnesota Soft Drink Association, told legislators the third partycollection system stands in the way of thetransition from wood to plastic. \"We're in the position of trying to make a pro-environmental system work,\" Locey said.\"What we want to do before we make this $15million investment in plastic pallets is makesure we can control them.\" Effective Aug. 1, 1998, third party collectors will be prohibited from taking plastic palletsthat are labeled as private property. The plastic pallets will have to clearly show the owner's name and address or telephonenumber, as well as a notice that the unautho-rized possession of the pallet is a violation ofstate law. The rightful owner of a stolen plastic pallet will be able to sue for damages equal to threetimes the cost of the pallet, in addition to legalexpenses. Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2696/SF2402*/CH282 Signed by the governorSigned by the governor Signed by the governor A bill approved by the Legislature would limit hours of operation and expand the no-wake zone forpersonal watercraft on Minnesota lakes.Red tags on petroleum tanks A new law aims to help the Minne-sota Pollution Control Agency(MPCA) bring all undergroundpetroleum storage tanks intocompliance. Petroleum from leaking tanks can seep into the groundwater supply and, yearslater, cause extensive soil and groundwatercleanup work and costly litigation. The new law authorizes the MPCA to \"red tag\" underground petroleum tanks that are inviolation of current regulations. Violationscould include failure to have the tank pro-tected from corrosion, failure to have spill oroverfill protection around the tank, or failureto have a leak detection method in place. A red tag on the cap of a tank will prohibit delivery of petroleum until the violations arecorrected. Gas station owners and other petroleum- dispensing facility operators have untilDec. 31, 1998, before the red tag provisionstake effect. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) and Sen.

HF2722*/SF2756/CH379 Lottery revenue dedication A new law will allow voters to ex-tend the duration of the dedicationof state lottery revenue to the Min-nesota Environmental and Natu-ral Resources Trust Fund. Under the law, voters in the No- vember 1998 general election will decide thefollowing question: \"Shall the Minnesota Con-stitution be amended to extend to the year2025 the dedication of lottery proceeds to theEnvironmental and Natural Resources Trust17 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYFAMILYFund and to maximize the long-term total to the fund?\" The fund was established by a constitu- tional amendment in 1988. At the time, thestate was allowed to earmark 50 percent of thelottery proceeds for the environmental fund. A second constitutional amendment in 1990 reduced to 40 percent the portion dedicated tothe environmental fund. That dedication ex-pires in 2001. The amount appropriated each year of a biennium under the constitutional amend-ment could be up to 5.5 percent of the marketvalue of the fund on June 30 one year preced- ing the start of the biennium. The fund's current value is about $210 mil- lion. About $22 million was dedicated forprojects in the current biennium. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. Steven Morse (DFL-Dakota) sponsoredthe new measure. HF113*/SF76/CH342 GAME & FISHGAMBLING Vetoed by the governor Signed by the governorSigned by the governor Family, early childhood bill Citing excessive spending, Gov.Arne Carlson vetoed a $14.9 mil- lion family and early childhood education spending bill. The bill would have appropri- ated money for programs such as Head Startand Early Childhood Family Education, childcare assistance, emergency services grants tohomeless shelters, gang prevention, and leadabatement projects. In his veto message, Carlson reminded the legislators of last year's \"historic budget in-crease for child care, Head Start, and otherchildren and family programs.\" The bill would have appropriated $5 mil- lion for a program that helps low- and moder-ate-income working families pay for child careusing an income-based, sliding-fee scale. Thebasic sliding fee child care program alreadyreceived an increase of over 130 percent overthe last biennium, Carlson said. Under the bill, an additional 17,000 families would have qualified for the Minnesota de-pendent care tax credit program. The bill wouldhave raised the maximum income thresholdfrom $31,000 to $38,000 at a cost of$4.9 million to the state. The governor closed his veto message with a general suggestion for lawmakers. \"Even-year legislative sessions should not be allowed to become full-blown tax and spendsessions,\" he wrote. \"How about consideringlimiting even-year sessions to three weeks andgiving the public a constitutional amendmentthat will allow them to create a unicameral legislature?\" A last-minute attempt by House sponsor Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) to re-vive a limited portion of the bill failed as the1998 session was coming to a close April 9. However, a family and early childhood spending package may be discussed during aspecial session set to begin April 20. Sen. Pat Piper (DFL-Austin) sponsored the vetoed bill in the Senate. HF2803/SF2532*/CH365 Gambling proceeds and the ADA A new law allows organizations touse legal gambling profits to bringtheir facilities into compliance withthe Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA). Under previous law, gambling proceeds could be used for con- struction or repairs on only certain types ofproperty. Legal uses included maintainingnonprofit facilities or replacing buildings lostto natural disaster or eminent-domain ruling. But the new law allows any group that earns money from legal gambling \u2014 including pulltabs and lottery tickets \u2014 to use those funds toeither improve handicapped access in a facil-ity or to replace an out-of-compliance facilitywith one that meets ADA requirements. Proponents said this will be useful for orga- nizations such as Veterans of Foreign Wars,which often can't afford to make handicapped-access improvements. The new law also allows licensed gambling organizations to pay salaries and winnings viaelectronic transfer. Under prior law, gamblingprofits had to follow a paper check trail. Pro-ponents said the new measure will increaseefficiency in large gambling operations. The law, effective March 24, 1998, was spon- sored by Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexing-ton) and Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy). HF2920/SF2911*/CH322 Ice fishing season extended Resort owners and anglers whowere disappointed by an unusuallymild winter were uplifted by thefirst bill signed into law this year. The law, which took effect Feb. 13, 1998, extended the 1998 ice fishing season by two weeks.Normally, the season closes on the third Sunday in February. The additional two-weekwindow gave resort owners an opportunity tocapture some lost revenue and gave anglers achance to make up for lost time. Another provision in the law extends the deadline for ice fishing houses to removedfrom Minnesota lakes in some cases. State law mandates that ice fishing houses be removed from the lakes by the end ofFebruary. The new law stipulates that if the last day of February falls on a Saturday, as it did this year,the deadline is extended by one day. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) spon-sored the legislation. HF2492/SF2111*/CH252 GOVERNMENT Signed by the governorState government finance Gov. Arne Carlson signed into lawa $33 million state governmentfinance package that includes fund-ing for a study of animal feedlots, acompulsive-gambling treatmentcenter in Granite Falls, Minn., and updates of the state's computer systems. The new law also provides funding for the attorney general's office, although Carlsonused his line-item veto authority to pare about$1 million from the office's proposed 1999budget. (See related story on page 21.) Some items that were initially approved by the House were dropped from the legislation's finalversion in conference committee, including aprovision that would have prohibited the Met-ropolitan Sports Facility from contracting with aprofessional sports team to play in theMetrodome for less than a seven-year period. Supporters of that measure, including Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) andRep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), said itwould be the only way to ensure that a repeatof the 1997 stadium debate wouldn'tdominate future legislative sessions. Also stripped in conference committee was a provision that would have allowed lawmak-ers to receive gifts worth less than $5 fromlobbyists, and one that would have delayedimplementation of a controversialfiber-optics program. Here's a look at key provisions that did make it into law, under the legislation spon-sored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia)and Sen. Len Price (DFL-Woodbury). All pro-visions took effect April 7, 1998, unless other-wise noted. HF3137/SF3354*/CH36618 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Attorney general's budget The Office of the Attorney General will receive $23 million for general operating ex-penses for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The $1.1 million that Carlson line-item ve- toed would have funded a program to educatesenior citizens about telemarketing fraud, le-gal assistance to state agencies and counties,and gaming enforcement. The office is still directed to set up an out- reach program to help educate people abouttelemarketing fraud by January 1999, eventhough the proposed $100,000 in funding forthe project was vetoed. In fact, that's how theprovision \u2014 with no money \u2014 was originallyapproved by the House. The attorney general's budget was in ques- tion because last year Carlson line-item ve-toed the office's entire proposed 1999 funding\u2014 about $24 million \u2014 citing what he calledunnecessary and excessive growth in the legaland law enforcement agency. This year's law also calls for a task force to study the availability, effectiveness, and costof legal services provided by the office.(Secs. 3, 69) Studying feedlots The law also provides $1.2 million for the first year of a three-year study of the effects ofthe livestock industry on the state's economyand environment. The study will be conducted by the Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning and willlook at issues like government regulation offeedlots, potential ownership arrangements,and the impact of current feedlots. A committee will be formed to advise the state's Environmental Quality Board on anenvironmental impact statement that will besubmitted to the Legislature. (Secs. 5, 86) Community-based planning The new law also amends a much-debated 1997 program aimed at spurring planningpartnerships between Minnesota Planning andlocal communities. The 1997 program provides guidance, re- view, and funding on a voluntary basis forcommunities to develop planning goals. At the request of several Greater Minnesota lawmakers \u2014 who said they were concernedthe program would not remain voluntary forlong \u2014 the law now limits the state's review ofthe plans to look only at the extent to whichthe plan promotes local citizen participation,spurs cooperation among communities, anddemonstrates sound community-based plan-ning goals. The law also gives more time for a commu- nity to revise a plan after receiving commentsfrom Minnesota Planning, and prohibits the state from considering participation in theprogram when determining eligibility for othergrants, loans, or funding packages. A proposal to expand membership on the program's existing advisory council and toextend the life of the council for six monthswas voted out in conference committee. Thecouncil will sunset June 30, 1998. (Sec. 78) Lottery changes The law also gives $750,000 from the Min- nesota lottery prize fund to support ProjectTurnabout, a compulsive-gambling treatmentcenter in Granite Falls. But it specifies that, apart from this appro- priation and ones approved in 1997, no morethan $340,000 may be used from that fund tosupport similar treatment or education pro-grams in fiscal year 1999. Effective July 1, 1998, the Minnesota State Lottery will be required to increase retailercommissions by 0.5 percent and ensure thateach retailer receives at least 1 percent of theamount of each winning ticket sold at thatlocation. They are also allowed to pay a bonus to lottery retailers of up to 10 percent of a poten-tial increase in lottery sales from one year tothe next, and to increase the percent of rev-enue with which they can fund lotteryexpenses. (Secs. 13, 70, 71, 73) Perpich's portrait Also under the new law, the state must accept a portrait of former Gov. Rudy Perpichand wife, Lola, if a private donor providesfunds for one. The state would have to substi-tute it for the portrait of Perpich currentlyhanging in the Capitol. Near the end of his time in office, the former governor pushed to have his wife included inhis official portrait, and the matter became thesubject of significant controversy. Portraits of each former Minnesota gover- nor hang throughout the corridors of the Capi-tol, and each is pictured alone. The Perpichportrait now found on the ground floor of theCapitol shows the former governor standingin front of an iron ore mine. (Sec. 85) Settling border disputes The law also provides $25,000 for the Coun- cil of State Governments to set up meetingsbetween Minnesota and Canadian lawmakersto discuss boundary disputes, including fish-ing laws. Many Minnesota residents living or owning businesses close to the Canadian border havecomplained for years about Canadian policiesincluding fishing limits, user fees, and bordercrossing permits that they say discriminate against U.S. anglers. (Sec. 2) Future Olympians Under the omnibus law, the Minnesota Ama- teur Sports Commission will receive $100,000 tofund development of a statewide winter sportsprogram for females and at-risk youth. The money will become a grant to the United States Olympic Committee's MinnesotaOlympic development program. (Sec. 9) Administration The new law grants the Department of Administration money for the followingprograms: $4.4 million to help update government com- puter systems to address problems associ-ated with the year 2000; $315,000 to Pioneer Public Television to build a tower in Otter Tail County, currentlythe only part of the state that does not re-ceive a public television signal; $150, 000 to coordinate the Minnesota Alli- ance with Youth initiative; $44,000 to make the State Register and the Minnesota Guidebook to State Agency Servicesavailable on the Internet free of charge; and $20,000 for a portrait of Gov. Arne Carlson to hang in the Capitol. (Sec. 6) Signed by the governorDisaster relief on its way Just 11 days after tornadoeswreaked havoc in south-centralMinnesota, Gov. Arne Carlsonsigned into law a package that willbring the area $27.6 million fordisaster relief. \"The power that comes from hope is very well represented in this package,\" Rep. RuthJohnson (DFL-St. Peter) said on the Housefloor when that body passed the legislation shesponsored. Effective April 10, 1998, the relief law pro- vides $8 million to match federal disaster as-sistance. Johnson said the state will assume the10 percent contribution normally funded bylocal governments under federal disaster re-lief. The federal government typically pays 75percent while states pay 15 percent and localgovernments pay 10 percent. Another $3.5 million appropriation will go to people rebuilding their homes. Loans up to$10,000 at no interest will go to those who stayin their homes for 10 years. Another $500,000will be provided in the form of forgivableloans for the reconstruction or rehabilitationof rental housing.

Legislators were told that Le Center, a town of 2,000, has 400 jobless residents be-cause of the storm. Another $1 million will be set aside for local government to repair and replace publiclyowned buildings, water systems, streets,bridges, and other infrastructure. The law also includes $250,000 for after-school child care and expanded day care services. Farmers will be provided with $4 million to A storm relief law passed this year provides $27.6 million to help tornado-stricken towns in Minnesota.St. Peter was one of the towns most affected by the March 29 tornadoes, which damaged many homeslike the one shown here on North Fourth Street in St. Peter. repair farm buildings and to obtain workingcapital operating loans. Tim Nelson, the disaster coordinator for Brown County, said more than 32,000 acres offarmland and drainage ditches are strewn withdebris, some of which is so heavy it will requireremoval by heavy machinery. But he said most of the debris will have to be removed by hand, and groups of volunteershave begun the slow process of removingchunks of wood, nails, and other debris from some fields. \"There are no machines that can do most of this work,\" Nelson said. Legislators also were told farmers need loans for machinery and seed, but that there wasrelatively little livestock loss in the area. Under the new law, another $3.2 million will be set aside as a contingency fund that canbe appropriated to the commissioner of fi-nance for allocations made at the governor'srequest or for unanticipated needs. Another $1 million will go toward loans or grants needed for historic preservation. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said the state needs to look into federal aid for the historicbuildings. \"It would be a shame if we passed up the chance to rebuild this city the way it was,\"Kahn said. St. Peter has 270 buildings that have been inventoried as possibly historic and 14 build-ings that are on the National Register of His-toric Places. Johnson's home was among the 1,000 in St. Peter to receive minor damage in the March29 storm. St. Peter Mayor Jerry Hawbaker toldthe House Ways and Means Committee via aninteractive television connection that the cityhad another 200 homes destroyed, plus 600others with major damage. The town of Comfrey, with a population of about 450, was almost completely destroyedin the string of tornadoes that prompted Presi- Was Comfrey, the town of about 450 people thatwas essentially demol-ished by a string of torna-does March 29, really named after a plant? Indeed, it was. The town is christened after the bristly, multi-colored vegetation.Here's a little history on the three commu-nities hit hardest by the tornadoes \u2014 Comfrey, Le Center, and St. Peter. Comfrey was named by the first post- master of the settlement, A.W. Pederson,in 1878. At the time, the United Statesgovernment was curious about havingfarmers raise comfrey as a forage crop. Pederson, a farmer, decided to give the plant's popularity a lift by naming the localpost office after the plant. When the townsite was laid out in 1899, the post office wasmoved, and town officials went along withthe name of Comfrey. Le Center got its name from its location.The Le Sueur County seat had moved more than once when businessmen decided toplace the seat near the center of the countyin the 1870s. The businessmen acquired a tract of 160 acres at what is now Le Center. They thenoffered the use of a newly constructed two-story brick building to the county boardfor use as a courthouse, pending a referen-dum that would allow the moving of thecounty seat to the new location which they called Le Sueur Center. The referendum was held and passed. County offices were moved in 1876, andthe offices have remained in what is nowcalled Le Center. St. Peter, one of the older cities in the state, was founded by Cpt. William B. Doddin 1853. It has been home to five gover-nors, including Henry Swift, who was thethird governor after statehood, and JohnA. Johnson. Among the 14 city sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places areOld Main at Gustavus Adolphus College,Nicollet County Courthouse, GovernorJohn A. Johnson House, Borneman House,and Union Presbyterian Church. It is estimated by current architectural experts that as many as 270 buildings in thetown could be considered historicstructures.

Department of Commerce Commissioner Dave Gruenes said the tornadoes probablycaused about $200 million in damage, muchof which is covered by private insurance. Rev. Dennis Johnson, vice president for college relations at St. Peter's damagedGustavus Adolphus College, told legislatorsthe best way to help the wounded collegewould be to help the community, where muchof the faculty and staff reside. \"We can not succeed in our mission at the college without a strong, vibrant community,\"he said. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the legislation in the Senate. HF3862*/SF3411/CH383 Abolish treasurers' office? Minnesota voters will decide inNovember whether to abolish thestate treasurer's office, under a newlaw signed by Gov. Arne Carlson. This year's ballot will contain a proposed constitutional amend- ment that would eliminate the elected office inJanuary 2003. If the amendment is approved,the treasurer, along with the secretary of stateand the commissioner of finance, would de-cide where to transfer the office's powers. \"Many studies over several decades have rec- ommended abolishing the office because it's ashell of its former self in terms of policy-mak-ing,\" said Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville),who sponsored the legislation in the House. The state treasurer currently receives and issues receipts for all monies paid into thestate treasury, handling about $150 billion intransactions annually. At one point the office was in charge of managing the state's permanent school fundand overseeing unclaimed properties, but thoseduties have been transferred to the State Boardof Investments and the Department of Com-merce, respectively. Most of the remaining responsibilities of the office, Greiling said, are cash-manage-ment duties that do not involvepolicy-making. Likely candidates to take over those duties include the secretary of state's office and thecommissioner of finance. Of the 13 current employees in the treasurer's office, two positions \u2014 those of thetreasurer and the assistant treasurer \u2014 wouldlikely be cut. The other positions would betransferred elsewhere. Greiling said an esti-mated $150,000 would be saved in salaries.

A measure passed this year will allow votersto decide whether the Minnesota Constitutionshould be amended to abolish the state treasurer'soffice in January 2003. ing the office \"is not to be saving money but tohave one less elected figure.\" The four-year term of the current state trea- surer, Michael McGrath, expires at the end of1998. Voters will elect a new treasurer in Novem- ber, at the same time they vote on the consti-tutional amendment. A majority of votersvoting in the election would have to supportabolishing the office in order to ratify theamendment. Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon- sored the legislation in the Senate. HF103/SF161*/CH387Signed by the governor Signed by the governorClaims against the state The family of a 14-year-old girlkilled in 1991 by a convicted sexoffender on his way from prison toa halfway house will receive almost$15,000, under a new law signed bythe governor. David and Gayle Johnson of Alexandria, Minn., filed a wrongful-death suit against thestate after their daughter was murdered by aconvict who had been released from St. Cloudprison five days earlier and ordered to reportto a halfway house in Minneapolis. He was notassigned an escort and did not show up at thehalfway house.Following the murder, the Legislature changed the law to require that escorts beprovided in similar situations, but the Minne-sota Supreme Court rejected the parents' claim. The Johnsons next turned for recourse to the Minnesota Legislature's Joint House-Sen-ate Subcommittee on Claims, which annuallyhears private restitution claims that have beenrefused by the courts or a state governmentdepartment. Effective April 7, 1998, this year's claims law authorizes payment of certain of those claimsagainst the state, as recommended by the sub-committee. A Benton County deputy who, in 1996, shot and killed a suspect in the murder of aSt. Joseph police officer will receive about$24,000. The deputy later suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome and was unable towork for eight months, but she was refusedlost-wage payment by Benton County. Several inmates or former inmates who suf- fered injuries while incarcerated, as well assome people injured while performing court-ordered community service, also will receivepayments this year. Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsoredthe claims legislation. HF3830*/SF3393/CH362 Donating 'distressed' foods Food handlers will be able to do-nate \"distressed\" foods to local gov-ernments or to the state, under anew law effective Aug. 1, 1998. Food is considered distressed when it cannot legally be sold but is still deemed safe \u2014 unspoiled milk that hasnot sold before the expiration date, forexample. Currently, food handlers can donate dis- tressed foods to nonprofit organizations whosupply the food to the elderly or needy. Thenew law will allow them to donate these foodsto units of government. The measure will remove liability for food handlers who choose to donate the distressedfood, except in instances of gross negligenceor intentional misconduct. Bill sponsor Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) said that the idea was brought toher by county commissioners who felt that itwould be a good way to defray correctionscosts. \"It's food that may not be marketable, but it is still safe for consumption,\" Harder said. Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored the bill in the Senate.

Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka)for an unusual announcement. The gover-nor had come to say goodbye. Gov. Arne Carlson appeared in the House chamber to make an unannounced visit \u2014rare for any governor \u2014 and to addressmembers. Carruthers asked lawmakers topause for the state's chief executive. Carlson is in his final year as governor, and after 30 years of holding political of-fice, he is leaving public life. His impromptuaddress was a quick thank you, good luck,and goodbye. Carlson said he has been lucky to serve throughout his career with people who care. \"I have met very honest, very dedicated, very concerned people,\" Carlson said, andhe included the current Legislature high onthat list. He said that at times, partisan debate can become heated, but that's unavoidable.Gov. Carlson makes impromptu visit to House chamber \"Clearly, this is precisely the essence of what democracy is all about. The factthat it exists and flourishes on this flooris something for us to celebrate,\" he said. \"I think the people of Minnesota are extraor-dinarily well-served. You've put in longdays and long hours and you do it out of acommitment to the well-being of thepeople. On behalf of my wife and I, I extenda personal thank you for the kindness youhave shown through the years.\" Carlson left the chamber \u2014 shaking hands with members along the way \u2014 to astanding ovation. The governor, 63, spent two years on the Minneapolis City Council from 1965 to1967, then four terms in the House beforebeing elected state auditor in 1978. He waselected governor in 1990 and re-elected in1994. Press Secretary Jackie Renner said that after his term is up, Carlson has consideredteaching part time or working on the schoolchoice issue, one of his key concerns asgovernor. Gov. Arne Carlson made a surpriseappearance in the House chamberApril 9 to say thank you, good luck,and goodbye. Red Cross volunteers Although Gov. Arne Carlson al-lowed a bill granting full pay tostate employees who volunteerfor the American Red Cross tobecome law without his signa-ture, he wrote that the legislation \"truly represents poorly thought-out publicpolicy.\" The new law, effective Aug. 1, 1998, allows any state employee to receive 100 percent paywhile volunteering for the Red Cross for up to15 days per year. \"Clearly, the intent is noble . . . but this bill goes well beyond the normal parameters ofgood judgment,\" Carlson wrote. He said the legislation was flawed for in- cluding only state employees and not private-sector or local government workers, and alsofor including volunteering with only the RedCross and not other disaster-relieforganizations. \"At the same time, how can a person be a 'volunteer' while receiving 100 percent pay?\"he wrote. He added that he hoped the Legisla-ture would consider altering the policy in thefuture. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls)sponsored the measure. HF2673*/SF1946/CH356State employee labor agreements Employees of the Minnesota Bu-reau of Criminal Apprehensionhave a new reason to look intotaking early retirement, under anew law. Effective April 3, 1998, certain employees of that bureau who retire beforeage 55 will now be eligible for employer-paidhealth insurance. The new law also ratifies labor agreements with state employment unions, compensationplans for state employees who are not repre-sented by unions, and salaries for state agencyheads. Those agreements, plans, and salaries had already been approved by a joint legislativesubcommittee on employee relations, and havebeen in effect on an interim basis. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, a separate provision of the new law will make a small change to thesalary of the Iron Range Resources and Reha-bilitation Board commissioner. That salarywill be capped at 75 percent of the governor'ssalary and will be set by the governor. Undercurrent law, the Legislative Coordinating Com-mission sets that salary. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) and Sen. Carol Flynn (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thenew measure. HF3068*/SF2520/CH351Attorney general's budget Following through on his earliercriticism of the size of the attor-ney general's budget request,Gov. Arne Carlson used his line-item veto to cut $1.1 million fromthe office's 1999 budget. Carlson said he was troubled by what he called misrepresentation by the attorneygeneral's office concerning a 1995 budget ap-propriation. He said the office had requested$3 million for one-time technology upgradesin 1996 and 1997 but had, in fact, spent about$2 million of that money on salary increases. That $2 million then expanded the office's budget base and led to an increased request forfuture funding, according to the governor. \"Frankly, the Office of the Attorney General possesses a division that deals with consumerissues and insists on high standards of truth-fulness,\" Carlson wrote. \"Those standards werenot applied to the 1996-1997 budgetexpenditures.\" But the governor left $23 million for the office's 1999 expenses in the new $32 millionomnibus state government law. Last year, he used his line-item veto author- ity to strike the attorney general's entire 1999budget of $24.4 million, citing what Carlsoncalled the enormous and unnecessary growthof the office since 1991. This year's $23 million appropriation willSigned by the governorFiled without signature Line-item vetoed by the governor22 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998HEALTHgo for core functions of the state's top legal and law enforcement agency for the fiscal yearthat begins July 1. The office is responsible forasserting and defending the state's legal inter-ests, settling claims, and aiding other law en-forcement agencies in prosecuting and solvingcases. The $1.1 million line-item vetoed by Carlson would have provided: $500,000 legal ser-vices to state agencies; $250,000 for for with felony prosecutions and re-lated tasks; and $100,000 for a fund to educatesenior citizens about telemarketing fraud. Carlson also noted that the $23 million appropriation represents a 13.6 percent in-crease over the office's previous base funding. \"Therefore, this line-item veto will do little more than return their service to normal,\" hewrote. The new law also calls for a task force to study the availability, effectiveness, and costof legal services provided by the attorneygeneral's office. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) and Sen. Len Price (DFL-Woodbury) sponsoredthe legislation. HF3137/SF3354*/CH366 Signed by the governorPrenatal alcohol abuse Gov. Arne Carlson signed a billinto law which will authorize thevoluntary reporting of prenatal al-cohol abuse. The legislation comes as a result of recommendations made by the Governor's Task Force on Fetal AlcoholSyndrome, which was chaired by first ladySusan Carlson. The task force was formed in July 1997 to formulate a comprehensive approach to theproblem of alcohol abuse during pregnancy.Approximately 800 children are born eachyear in Minnesota with the effects of FetalAlcohol Syndrome, according to the task force. Effective Aug. 1, 1999, the new law will permit health care workers, counselors, andothers working with pregnant women to re-port instances of suspected alcohol abuse tolocal welfare authorities. The law will require that the local welfare agency then conduct an assessment and offernecessary services to the pregnant woman. An earlier version of the bill would have made prenatal abuse of alcohol statutorygrounds for civil commitment and requiredlocal welfare agencies to petition for commit-ment in cases where the woman fails to follow treatment recommendations. The civil commitment process is used to require individuals to accept health care when,because of mental illness or other reasons,they do not realize the need for treatment.Civil commitment usually prompts hospital-ization, which allows the individual to bemonitored and effectively treated. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) sponsoredthe new measure. HF3184*/SF3207/CH361 Signed by the governorSigned by the governor A new state law will protect people who are not trained in medicine from litigation if they use anautomatic external defibrillator in an attempt to save another's life. A dummy was used for a Capitoldemonstration of such a device this year. Improper use of DEA numbers The U.S. Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration (DEA) uses a num-bering system that was establishedto identify medical professionalsand others who are authorized toengage in business activities involv- ing controlled substances. But the insurance industry and health plan companies have sometimes used DEA num-bers for other purposes, such as tracking thedrug prescription practices of health careproviders. That will no longer be allowed under a new law, which will not take effect for at least twoyears. Its effective date is 24 months after aunique, alternative health identifier is adopted. The identifier is expected to be adopted under the federal legislation dealing with healthinsurance portability and accountability. Thestatus of that identifier is pending. The DEA has tried to get national healthinsurance associations to find an alternative to the industry use of DEA numbers and hasasked its registrants to refuse to furnish DEAnumbers to insurance providers for reimburse-ment purposes. The DEA claims misuse couldweaken the registration system, and the agencyhas sought to restrict the registration numbersto use for drug enforcement purposes. The new state law will limit the use of DEA numbers for law enforcement purposes, andthus prohibit insurance providers or healthplan companies from monitoring the pre-scribing practices of a practitioner. The law also stipulates a prescription that is not a controlled substance does not have tobear a DEA number. Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon-sored the measure. HF2401/SF2207*/CH316 Rendering emergency care Volunteers and others who pro-vide emergency medical care withan automatic external defibrillatorwithout expectation of compensa-tion will not be liable for civil dam-ages under a new law effective Aug. 1, 1998. The law broadens the existing \"Good Sa- maritan statute,\" which provides immunity tovolunteers or untrained people who give emer-gency care, unless a patient objects. Many airlines and businesses now carry automatic external defibrillators, which re-store the heart's rhythm by delivering an elec-23 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYtric shock. To use an automatic external defibrillator, the rescuer places two pads onthe victim's chest and the device measures theheart's rhythm. If the device detects ventricu-lar fibrillation, the machine directs the user topush a button to deliver a shock. Under the new law, any volunteer or other person who does not expect compensationwill be able to render the emergency carewithout fear of civil liability, unless the persongiving the care acts in a reckless manner. The law will apply only to the scene of an emergency outside of a hospital or otherfacility where licensed practitioners areavailable. Rep. Geri Evans (DFL-New Brighton) and Sen. John Hottinger the measure. HF3138/SF2861*/CH329 Signed by the governorHepatitis B vaccinations Children who enroll in kindergar-ten beginning in the 2000-2001school year will have to be vacci-nated against hepatitis B, under anew law effective Aug. 1, 1998. The law also will apply to chil- dren enrolling in kindergarten through theseventh grade beginning with the 2007-2008school term. But the law will exempt familieswho object to the vaccination for religious orother reasons. Hepatitis B is caused by a virus and is spread by contact with an infected person's blood orother body fluids. It can also be spread bysharing washcloths, razors or needles, andthrough tattooing. The vaccination processinvolves a schedule of three doses of thevaccine. The disease causes liver inflammation that can lead to liver failure or cancer. Roughly 80 percent of infants receive the vaccination in conjunction with other child-hood vaccinations. The law's purpose is toinoculate those who now do not receive thevaccination. The cost of the vaccination program for those entering kindergarten is covered undera federal program. Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood) and Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick) sponsoredthe measure. HF2681/SF2372*/CH305'Off-label' drug coverage Cancer patients who find relieffrom certain treatments not ap-proved by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration for their specific formof cancer no longer will have towonder if their health plan will pay for the treatment. A new state law will require health mainte- nance organizations and other health plans topay for \"off-label\" use of drugs prescribed forcancer treatment. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, thelaw will stipulate that all health plans, includ-ing Medicare supplemental coverage, may notrefuse to pay for cancer treatments involvingdrugs that are already on a plan's formulary. \"Off-label\" drug use is the prescribing of drugs recognized as a treatment for at leastone form of cancer in standard medical litera-ture. Cancer specialists indicate about 10 per-cent of their patients respond to treatmentthat is not covered for their specific cancerunder their insurance plan. Drugs are often approved by the FDA for treatment of certain cancers, and further re-search sometimes finds the drug is beneficialfor a wider range of cancers. But drug companies rarely resubmit these medications for FDA approval because of thetime and cost involved. Some health plansthen refuse to pay for use of these prescriptiondrugs if the medication is not FDA-approvedfor a specific cancer. The law will not apply to drugs used in experimental cancer treatment. There are 27 other states with similar laws related to off-label drug use. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored themeasure.

Effective Feb. 26, 1998, a new state law allows state designation of rural nonprofit orpublic hospitals and facilities as \"critical toaccess.\" Such facilities can be certified by thestate as necessary providers of health careservices to residents in the area. Necessary providers can be those 20 miles from the nearest hospital, those that are thesole hospital in a county, or those that meetcertain federal criteria.Signed by the governorThere is the potential for 39 such hospitals in the state to receive the special designation. Under federal law, critical access hospitals receive enhanced reimbursement and regula-tory flexibility in exchange for limiting theirinpatient services while maintaining emer-gency medical services. A study by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, part of the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, indi-cates traumatic injuries are more common inrural areas. Rural areas also have a larger per-centage of elderly people than urban areas andhigher poverty rates, according to the agency. The small, rural hospitals designated as \"critical access\" facilities will retain patientsonly for a limited time, but the hospitals willbe able to arrange for transfers and referralswhen longer hospitals stays are required. The bill was the first introduced by Rep. Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie), whowon a special election last fall to replace herlate husband, Ken. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the legislation in the Senate. The new law also calls for the Minnesota Department of Health to develop a rural healthplan within the current level of funding. HF2550*/SF2261/CH257 Acquiring nonprofit hospitals Gov. Arne Carlson used his veto authority to reject legislation thatwould have made purchase ofnonprofit hospitals by for-profitchains more difficult. The measure would have required that whenever a nonprofit hospital proposes totransfer more than 50 percent of its assets orfinancial control to a for-profit group, it mustnotify the state attorney general in writing. The attorney general already has the power to investigate and stop such transactions, butthe legislation would have ensured that writ-ten notice would go to the attorney general'soffice 45 days in advance of any deal. Under the legislation, the attorney general could have made the notice accessible to thepublic if the office determined the public wouldbenefit from the information. The governor wrote in his veto statement, \"I am persuaded that the office of the attorneygeneral can adequately protect the public'sinterest in this area with the authority grantedunder current law.\" Carlson also indicated he thought the bill \"established a litigious, adversarial process forconducting business transactions which I findunnecessary. \"While I recognize the value of community hospitals, I cannot support the wholesale lock-Vetoed by the governorSigned by the governor24 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998out of noncharitable business entities in the marketplace, which is the effect of the bill.\" He also said, \"In some instances, particu- larly in the case of a financially struggling ruralcommunity hospital, the public may be bestserved by the noncharitable acquisition of thehospital, especially when the only alternativeis closure of the facility.\" Nonprofit hospitals are generally viewed as charitable community assets, but from 1990to 1996 a total of 192 nonprofit hospitalsnationwide were converted to for-profitstatus. Public funds are used for various projects at nonprofit hospitals. If the hospital is acquiredby a for-profit company, the company likelyacquires assets paid for with public dollars,possibly at less than fair-market value. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill. HF381/SF695*/CH330 HIGHER EDUCATION Higher education funding A new Minnesota higher educa-tion funding law will spend $72.5million \u2014 the largest supplemen-tal budget increase for higher edu-cation in this decade \u2014 to improvethe state's colleges and universities. Appropriations in the new law will target $35.5 million for the University of Minnesotaand $36 million for the Minnesota State Col-lege and Universities (MnSCU) system. Another $1 million will go to the Higher Education Services Office to bolster work studyprograms on the state's college campuses. Allof the spending provisions are effectiveJuly 1, 1998. Gov. Arne Carlson line-item vetoed a total of $500,000 that would have gone to theU of M for two separate programs \u2014 an on-campus law clinic and an effort to address theshortage of school counselors in K-12 schools.(See related story on this page.) Much of the remaining money for the U of M will go toward \"strategic academicinitiatives,\" which are programs \u2014 such asmolecular and cellular biology \u2014 that areconsidered crucial to ensure the university'sfuture as a leading academic institution. The bulk of the appropriation for MnSCU's seven state universities and 29 two-year col-leges will go toward reduction of the widevariances in the amount of per-student fund-ing the individual institutions receive. Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls) spon-sored the higher education finance legislation. Here's a look at some highlights of the new law. HFnone/SF3297*/CH384 Funding for MnSCU A total of $20 million will reduce variances in state funding per full-year equivalent stu-dent at the 36 MnSCU institutions. Minnesota currently spends more per student at some two-year institutions than at some of itsfour-year campuses. Significant disparities existin the amount of money the state's institutionsreceive per full-time equivalent student. For example, Southwest State University in Marshall, Minn., receives about $2,000 moreper student than Mankato State University. The variance between the highest- and low- est-funded state universities for fiscal year1998 is 54 percent, and the disparity betweenthe highest- and lowest-funded two-yearschools reaches 90 percent. Under the new law, MnSCU will be ex- pected to develop its own allocation model forfiscal year 2000 and beyond. The model will berequired to minimize the variance in per-student funding between institutions and toreduce campus and system reliance on one-time funding. The law also will provide $10 million to enhance partnerships between MnSCU insti-tutions and business and industry. The appropriation will go toward efforts to increase the number of students enrolled ininternships by providing incentives for busi-nesses to train, place, and retain students.Also, the funding will support efforts to re-structure degree and certificate programs somore of them require internships. The new law also will provide $3 million for MnSCU libraries to purchase materials andequipment. Another $3 million included in the law will help universities to redesign teacher educa-tion curriculum to ensure that would-be teach-ers are prepared to work with the state's newK-12 graduation standards and to integratetechnology into teaching methods. University of Minnesota spending A total of $31.9 million of the new law's $35.5 million for the U of M will go towardimprovement of key academic initiatives. Fields specifically targeted for improvement include programs in digital technology andprograms in molecular and cellular biology.The funds will be available for hiring faculty,purchasing equipment, or making otherimprovements. Both the governor and the university requested $41.5 million in supplementalappropriations for the U of M. Signed by the governorUniversity President Mark Yudof has fo- cused on investing in the school's molecularand cellular biology programs and other keyacademic initiatives since he took over as presi-dent in 1997. His goal is to create an institute for molecu- lar and cellular biology with the aim of push-ing the school into the top five publicuniversities in biological sciences. Yudof requested funds from the 1998 Leg- islature to recruit 11 blue-chip faculty mem-bers during the next three years and to providethem with equipment needed for research.The president also intends to hire another15 junior faculty members by redirectingprevious U of M funding. The law also requires that an unspecified portion of the $31.9 million to go towardagricultural research into problems affectingMinnesota farmers. Those problems includeplant diseases that have damaged wheat andbarley crops and respiratory diseases that havehit turkeys on many farms in the state. A separate provision of the new law will provide an additional $3.6 million for agricul-tural research and outreach programs. Higher education funding cut Gov. Arne Carlson used his line-item veto authority to cut$500,000 from a $73 millionhigher education funding planapproved by the Legislature. Funding for the University of Minnesota's law clinic, which is essentially afree law firm on campus, was one of the itemscut by the governor. Carlson struck down$250,000 earmarked for the clinic. \"The law clinic appropriation is disturbing because it ought to be a self-sustaining pro-gram,\" Carlson wrote in his veto message.\"Promoting pro bono activities by law schoolstudents is a worthy goal and should be finan-cially supported within the law schoolbudget.\" The law clinic provided legal assistance to more than 700 low-income Minnesotans in1997, according to law school officials. Therecipients of the free legal services were repre-sented by second- and third-year U of M lawstudents, who work for clients under supervi-sion of clinic instructors. Law school officials said that with the $250,000 from the state for fiscal year 1999 theschool planned to add 80 more students to thelaw clinic. That would have translated into anadditional 6,000 hours of legal services andanother 200 clients. The law school officials also said 50 percent of the clinic's current $900,000 annual budgetcomes from tuition, with 15 to 17 percentLine-item vetoed by the governor25 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYHOUSINGfrom the state. The rest comes through private contributions and through a federal grant. The governor also deleted a $250,000 ap- propriation for the U of M-administeredProject Inform, a program designed to ad-dress the shortage of high school counselors inMinnesota by providing outreach and infor-mation to K-12 students and their families. \"I believe that the Department of Children, Families and Learning should be involved insuch important K-12 activities and object to[its] non-involvement in this proposed solu-tion,\" the governor said. The remainder of the new law represents the largest supplemental budget increase forhigher education in this decade. The $72.5million in appropriations would target nearly$36 million each for the University of Minne-sota and the Minnesota State Colleges andUniversities system. Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls) spon-sored the measure. HFnone/SF3297*/CH384 HUMAN SERVICESSigned by the governorSigned by the governor Signed by the governorHousing options for seniors A new law seeks to create moreaffordable housing options forseniors. Effective March 19, 1998, the law expands the statutory definition ofelderly housing as it applies to the human rights law, bringing state law into com-pliance with federal statutes. The effect is thatmore facilities may classify as elderly housingexclusively. The new law removes the requirement that elderly housing must provide facilities de-signed to meet social and physical needs, suchas recreation and meeting rooms. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley), sponsor of the measure, said that the addi-tional services provided to tenants mean addi-tional cost in rent. \"These types of facilities often cause rent to be $100 to $300 higher than other facilities,\"he said. Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF2779/SF2230*/CH291Tenant security deposits A new law, effective Aug. 1, 1998,will extend the current interestrate paid by property owners ontenant security deposits. Current law sets the rate at 3 percent until May 1999, and afterthat time the rate was to be in- creased to 4 percent. The rate increase wassupposed to parallel an increase in interestrates generally; however, interest rates haveremained low. Property owners said that after 1999 they would be paying a higher rate to hold depositfunds than most financial institutions wouldpay. The new law will change the date of the increase to 4 percent from May 1, 1999, toMay 1, 2001. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) spon-sored the measure. HF2590*/SF2122/CH266 Selling abandoned homes A new state law aims to helpMinnesota's manufactured-homepark owners rid their properties ofabandoned homes. Effective March 17, 1998, the law authorizes the owner of a manu- factured-home park to obtain a limited dealer'slicense and to sell up to five used homes thatare within the park's boundaries per year. Previously, only real estate agents and li- censed dealers were permitted to sell manu-factured homes in Minnesota. The legislation was introduced at the re- quest of rural park owners who were havingdifficulties attracting agents to sell low-endhomes. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) and Sen. StevenNovak (DFL-New Brighton). HF3148/SF2047*/CH280 Health and human services bill New abortion reporting requirements are part of a $58 million health and human ser-vices finance bill passed by the House in thewaning moments of the 1998 session. The votewas 99-34. The bill, which awaits action by Gov. Arne Carlson, was the subject of a lengthy standoffover abortion-related provisions. The Househad earlier approved a version of the bill thatcalled for a ban on late-term (or so-called \"partial birth\") abortions and for new report-ing requirements. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), appeared to be introuble after the House rejected a conferencecommittee version of the bill that did notinclude any of the abortion-related provisions.However, a last-minute compromise on newabortion reporting requirements helped thebill to win final passage. The abortion-related provisions make up just a small portion of an omnibus bill thatwould provide funds for salary increases fornursing home employees, prevention of FetalAlcohol Syndrome, food stamps for legal non-citizens, and efforts to ensure food safety. Also, the bill includes provisions that Min- nesota must adopt to receive federal fundstotaling $58 million for welfare programs and$28 million for health care for children. The governor's 1998 supplemental budget proposal for health and human services calledfor a total appropriation of just under$31.7 million. Here's a look at key provisions of the health and human services bill ( HF2868/SF3346* ). Abortion reporting The final version of the bill would require that medical practitioners provide the statewith information about abortions they per-form and that the Department of Health re-lease an annual public report compilingMinnesota abortion statistics. Physicians would be required to report a variety of factors related to each abortion pro-cedure. Specifically, each physician would haveto disclose the number of abortions he or sheperformed within the previous year, themethod used for each abortion, the approxi-mate gestational age at the time of the abor-tion, and the age of each woman who has anabortion. Also, physicians would be asked to supply a specific reason for the abortion. The bill lists arange of reasons \u2014 such as the pregnancyposes a risk to the woman's health, the preg-nancy resulted from rape or incest, or thewoman does not want children at the time \u2014that could be listed, but the reasons that couldbe listed by doctors would not be limited tothose listed in the bill. The bill stipulates that the woman would not have to provide a reason. The reporting requirements also would seek information about the number of previousabortions the woman has had and the methodof payment for the abortion. And physicianswould be required to provide informationrelated to complications stemming from abor-tion procedures. To find out who represents you at the Capitol . . . Call the House Public Information Office at (612) 296-214626 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998The Department of Health would be re- quired to release an annual report beginningin 2000 on abortion in Minnesota. The billwould mandate that the report protect theidentity of doctors who perform abortionsand women who undergo abortions. If the department fails to produce the pub- lic report on time, any group of 100 or morecitizens would be allowed to seek a court in-junction to force timely release of the infor-mation, under the bill. The bill also includes a provision that would slap a fine on physicians or medical facilitiesthat fail to report on time. After a report is 90days late, the physician or facility could befined $500 for each 30-day period the report isoverdue. Fighting Fetal Alcohol Syndrome The bill includes $5 million to fight Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a series of birth defectsthat can result from alcohol consumptionduring pregnancy. Minnesota first lady Susan Carlson co- chaired the Governor's Task Force on FetalAlcohol Syndrome, which last year estimatedthe disease costs Minnesota taxpayers at least$45 million annually in health, judicial, andsocial services costs. The $5 million included in the omnibus funding bill matches the governor's requestfor the program. Under the bill, the health department would design and implement a statewide program toraise public awareness about Fetal AlcoholSyndrome. The program would have to in-clude a toll-free resource and referral line. A total of $800,000 would be spent for the publicawareness campaign. Another $400,000 would be used to develop a statewide network of regional Fetal AlcoholSyndrome diagnostic clinics, and to help trainhealth care providers to deal with theproblem. The bill also would provide $350,000 to fund creation of a fetal alcohol coordinationboard, which would review and coordinateexisting state programs and integrate state andlocal prevention and intervention programs. A total of $850,000 would be for a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome community grant program.The commissioner of health would adminis-ter the program, which would finance work bycommunity organizations on prevention andintervention. Another $850,000 would go to the Depart- ment of Human Services to expand treatmentservices for women who abuse alcohol duringpregnancy. The Journal of the American Medical Asso- ciation reports Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is theleading known cause of mental retardation. Nursing home workers The bill calls for a 3 percent wage increase for nursing home employees. The increase inper diem payments to long-term care facilitieswould cost the state about $20 million. The nursing home spending is part of an effort to stabilize the workforce at nursingfacilities. Low wages among most nursinghome employees, coupled with bountiful job Controversy over abortion-related provisions in a health and human services finance bill brought outprotesters from both sides of the issue. The final version of the bill would require physicians to meet newabortion reporting requirements.opportunities in other fields in the currentbooming economy, have made it difficult fornursing homes to attract and keep workers. The state pays nursing homes a per diem for each resident based on location, property costsand taxes, case mix, and other operating costs.Case mix is determined by the extent of careneeded for each patient. Under the bill, per diem payments would increase by 3 percent and the money would beused to pay nursing home workers who pro-vide direct care to patients, perform house-keeping, and handle other such duties. Theincrease would take effect July 1. Nursing home workers told lawmakers this session that their work is emotionally stressfuland often leads to occupational-related inju-ries such as back problems, the result of liftingpatients. Legislators also were told that understaffing leads to distress for patients and problems thatinclude malnutrition, which can result frominsufficient staff to handle all patients at mealtimes. Helping legal immigrants The bill includes funds for food stamps for thousands of legal immigrants in the state whoare not eligible for the federal food stampprogram. About $5.4 million would go to-ward providing food stamps for legal nonciti-zens, under the bill. The funds would be used to establish a one- year, state-funded program for legal nonciti-zens who, if not for their citizenship status,would otherwise be eligible for federal foodstamp benefits. The food assistance program was not part of the governor's health and human servicesspending recommendations. The program would provide food assistance to legal noncitizens who are not on MinnesotaFamily Investment Plan-Statewide (MFIP-S),which allows families to accept lower-payingjobs and receive some state aid while workingtoward the goal of getting off publicassistance. The federal Welfare Reform Act of 1996 made noncitizens ineligible for the federalfood stamp program, but the federal 1997Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Actgives states the option to purchase food stampbenefits for those who are ineligible becausethey are not citizens. That option requires states to pay for the value of the food stamp benefits, plus the federalgovernment's cost for providing the option. Counties would use the same income, bud- geting, and benefit allotment regulations forthe state program as for the federal food stampprogram.27 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYTwelve other states currently provide simi- lar assistance. Another nearly $3.8 million would help extend the food supplement to legal nonciti-zen families on MFIP-S, which is the state'smain welfare reform initiative. A cash benefit equal to $63 a month, which was designated to replace the value of the foodstamps lost when noncitizens became ineli-gible for the federal food stamp program, wasscheduled to end June 30, 1998. The bill wouldextend the benefit and also make eligible legalnoncitizen families who are on MFIP-S, re-gardless of whether they became state resi-dents as of July 1, 1997, as current law stipulates. Food safety There is also $2.5 million in the bill for a food safety initiative. The money would betargeted toward state efforts to improve foodsafety. Some funds also would be used to studyand protect against food-borne illness. Increasingly, fruits and vegetable are im- ported, and roughly half of food dollars arespent eating in restaurants, where food can beimproperly handled or stored. Dr. Michael Osterholm, state epidemiolo- gist for the Minnesota Department of Health,has told legislators this year that the supposed6,000 to 8,000 annual deaths connected withcontaminated food are underestimated. Osterholm also has said that at certain times of the year nearly 100 percent of fresh fruitsand vegetables available are grown in develop-ing nations. He has said if that produce werepurchased by Americans abroad, they wouldbe advised to boil and peel it before eating. Consumer health assistance If you can't get referred to a chiropractor under your current health plan, where do youturn? Minnesota health plan companies andhealth care professionals are governed by morethan 20 boards and oversight bodies. People confused or unhappy about their health plan would have a one-stop place tocall, under a $100,000 provision in the bill thatwould go to establish an office of health careconsumer assistance. The office would have no regulatory power, but it would have a broad range of duties. Itwould assist consumers who have complaintsor questions about their health plan or healthcare provider. It would also help them under-stand their legal rights and get appropriatehealth care referrals. The state commissioner of health would appoint an executive director, and the officewould have at least nine consumer advocatesto perform the duties of the office. Preceding this provision was a 1997 law, the Patient Protection Act, which aimed to pre-vent health plan companies from interfering with the medical professional-patient rela-tionship, and to provide patients with accu-rate information about their health plan andhealth plan companies. INDUSTRYSigned by the governor Signed by the governorProtecting telephone customers A new law aims to protect Minne-sota telephone customers from un-authorized switching oflong-distance telephone carriers. \"While most long-distance pro- viders conduct their business in an ethical, above-board fashion, there are somethat unfortunately do not,\" Gov. Arne Carlsonsaid in a news release. \"In signing this legisla-tion, we are now able to give Minnesotansprotection from unscrupulous carriers.\" A new provision, effective July 1, 1998, will require long-distance providers to give priceinformation on specific calling patterns toconsumers and will forbid the providers fromthe practice of \"slamming,\" or switching cus-tomers without their knowledge. The long-distance providers will have to provide proof that a customer authorized a change in carriers. If the provider is unable to produce a written statement or a tape record-ing indicating the customer authorized thechange, the carrier will have to pay the cost ofreturning the customer to the original serviceand the cost of any of the customer's long-distance calls during the unauthorized period. Long-distance companies also will have to provide upon request \u2014 or when solicitingcustomers \u2014 information on the price rangeof services, minimum volume requirements,termination charges, and other fees. Biomass fuels A separate provision effective April 1, 1998, provides an exemption to requirements ofbiomass-fueled power plants. Examples of bio-mass power sources are sawdust or wood chips,agricultural residues, and the organic portionof the solid waste stream. Previous law provided that biomass-fueled power plants can use non-biomass fuels for upto 25 percent of their fuel. The new law pro-vides an expansion so that when biomass fuelsources are not reasonably available to thefacility because flood, fire, drought, disease orother acts of God, the power facility can ex-ceed the exemption without penalty or a chargeagainst its normal 25 percent exemption. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton) spon-sored the legislation. HF3042*/SF2797/CH345Pipeline excavation notices A new law will make a distinctionbetween information needed be-fore a pipeline excavation and in-formation needed before a landsurvey when notifying the GopherState One-Call excavation notice system. The provision is effective Aug. 1, 1998. Current law requires these notices to con- tain the same information. The new law re-moves language pertaining to anticipateddischarge of explosives when only a survey isbeing done. The Minnesota Pipeline Safety Act of 1987 mandated the establishment of a one-call no-tification center for facility operators, whichbecame the Gopher State One-Call. That actincluded definitions and requirements fornotices given by excavators and undergroundfacility operators. Underground facility operators include those who deal with electricity, power, heat,gas, oil, and water. The new law also requires, as of Jan. 1, 1999, that operators maintain maps, drawings, dia-grams, and other records of any undergroundfacility that was abandoned or out of serviceafter Dec. 31, 1998. And a provision effective June 30, 1998, will allow the commissioner of public safety toappoint a pipeline advisory committee. This discretionary advisory committee would replace the Pipeline Safety AdvisoryCouncil, and it would be governed by thestatute pertaining to advisory councils andcommittees rather than administrative boardsand agencies. The difference is that members on advisory councils and committees serve at the pleasureof the appointing authority. Members of thecurrent council may be removed for missingthree consecutive meetings. The new committee would consist of repre- sentatives of the hazardous liquid pipelineindustry, the gas distribution industry, the gaspipeline industry, the pipeline design and con-struction industry, state or local government,and the general public. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Steven Novak (DFL-New Brighton)sponsored the legislation.

The law will prohibit people who do not meet certain requirements from usingspecific titles including industrial hygienist,certified safety professional, and constructionhealth and safety technologist. Only those who have attended an accred- ited college or university and received theproper certification will be allowed to usethose professional titles. For instance, a certi-fied industrial hygienist will have to pass a testby the nonprofit American Board of Indus-trial Hygiene and maintain that license inorder to use the title. The restrictions will not apply to properly supervised apprentices, or to employees of thestate of Minnesota, who are already subject tostrict standards. Rep.

Under the law, \"financially strong\" insurers will be allowed to choose tobe governed by the new provisionsrather than by current state insur- ance laws, which will remain in place. To use the new investment options, insur- ers will be required to have a minimum of$2 billion in total assets and a total capital andsurplus of $200 million. Insurers who qualify and decide to invest under the new law could invest in anythingwithin a standard considered by the company'sboard of directors, subject to an internal con-trol system. The companies will have to have awritten investment policy. The commissioner of commerce will re- quire information from insurers, and the com-missioner could hire an expert to review aninsurer's investments. The commissioner alsowill be able to order insurers to change theirinvestments.Rep. Ann Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe measure. HF3355/SF3032*/CH319 MCHA cap increased The maximum lifetime benefit forpeople who get their health cover-age through Minnesota Compre-hensive Health Association(MCHA) increased from $1.5 mil-lion to $2 million, under a new law effective March 19, 1998. The change was necessary to address the needs of a southern Minnesota boy who suf-fers from Melnick-Needles Syndrome, a boneand cartilage disorder. The boy requires a full-time nurse, specialized equipment, frequenthospital visits, and medications. A 1995 law moved the cap on MCHA ben- efits from $1 million to $1.5 million becausethe boy's medical expenses were approachingthe limit and he was at risk of being cut offfrom coverage. This year, the child was closing in on the $1.5 million maximum. Also, supporters ofthe new law said $2 million is the standardlimit for lifetime health benefits. The Legislature created MCHA in 1976 to sell insurance to state residents who have beenturned down for insurance due to pre-existingconditions. The organization is not funded by the state. Premiums are collected from participants andfrom an annual assessment on insurance com-panies, health maintenance organizations, andother insurance providers. The boy could have been forced onto the government-funded Medical Assistance pro-gram, had the MCHA coverage limit not beenincreased. The new measure was sponsored by Rep. John Dorn (DFL-Mankato) andSen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan). HF3065/SF2608*/CH293 Medical equipment, supplies A new law effective Jan. 1, 1999,will require health plans to tell cli-ents what medical equipment andsupplies are covered. The law also will stipulate that any health plan that covers durable medical equipment may not exclude coverageof devices used in the home. In addition, health plans will be required to tell members and prospective members thenature of the coverage for durable medicalequipment, level of coverage available, proce-dures for prior authorizations, and an address or telephone number of someone with theplan that the member can call to get informa-tion, either verbally or in writing, on what'scovered and not covered. Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm) and Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Anoka) sponsoredthe new measure. HF2814*/SF2130/CH334 No break on insurance premiums Gov. Arne Carlson used his vetoauthority to strike down legisla-tion that would have allowed driv-ers who successfully complete anaccident prevention course to get a break on auto insurancepremiums. Drivers over 30 years old who passed the safety course would have received a 10 percentreduction in their auto insurance premiums,under the bill. Currently, drivers 55 and olderwho pass an accident prevention course everythree years receive a premium reduction. In his veto message, Carlson wrote, \"Statis- tical analyses fail to provide evidence thatsuccessful completion of additional driver test-ing results in heightened safety rates on Min-nesota roadways.\" He said automobile insurance premiums ought to be determined by the market andindividual driving records. \"Any mandated rate reduction to one class of citizen drivers would unfairly shift costs tothose of the unprotected class,\" he said. \"Inthis case, the shift would take place on thosedrivers who are already paying the highestpremiums within this state, that is, those driv-ers under the age of 30.\" Carlson also said while a driver safety course can be effective for those 55 and older, \"I donot believe that the completion of this type ofprogram would be effective on youngerdrivers.\" The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington) andSen. Douglas Johnson (DFL-Tower).

Arne Carlson has allowed a measure calling for severalchanges in information policy tobecome law without his signature.He took the opportunity to com- ment on the changes in a two-page letter hefiled with the bill. The new law makes several changes in Minnesota's Government Data Practices Act,which classifies information the state govern-ment collects as public or private. The governor wrote that the law lacks the comprehensive reforms that are necessary toaddress the problems with the data practiceslaw. \"The current bill does not address substan- tive reforms, but rather continues the legisla-tive track of enacting complicating minutiae,and poorly balancing the public's 'right toknow' with citizens' rights to privacy,\" Carlsonwrote. The most notable provision in the new law will allow the Legislature to subpoena countychild protection workers. The new law came as a result of legislators' attempt to reform the state's child protectionsystem in the wake of three-year-old DesiIrving's death in Minneapolis. Last year, Mildred Irving pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in her daughter's death.She admitted to the court that she repeatedlyhit Desi with an extension cord, broke one ofDesi's arms, and punched her in the abdomenso hard that the child's liver was lacerated. Theautopsy results showed that Desi had sufferednumerous broken bones, had cigarette burnsand many other scars, and had been sufferingfrom malnutrition before her death. The brutality of Desi's death was accented by the fact that evidence shows that the Irvingfamily had been in contact with HennepinCounty's child protection services. Legislators sought to make sure that chil- dren like Desi were protected in the future.Attempts to bring Hennepin County case-workers to testify before the Legislature faileddue to data privacy issues. Caseworkers ex-pressed a desire to disclose the facts of the case.However, they feared losing their jobs if theybroke the data privacy law. The new provision, effective April 10, 1998, provides an exemption to current data privacylaw for child protection in the case where theinformation is subpoenaed by a standing leg-islative committee. The provision is only toremain in effect until July 1, 1999.The governor expressed concern in his let- ter about this provision. \"Although I am a staunch advocate of open- ing up court records for juvenile proceedingswhen necessary, the Legislature is simply notthe government entity to conduct such inves-tigations,\" Carlson wrote. Carlson stated he is concerned that the Leg- islature has not outlined adequate safeguardsto ensure the protection of this information.He wrote that he is also concerned that theprovision sets a dangerous precedent and thatit violates the separation of powers betweenthe legislative and judicial branches ofgovernment. The new law also contains several provi- sions, effective Aug. 1, 1998, which attempt tomake the transition from welfare to workeasier. One such provision addresses Minnesota Family Investment Program-Statewide(MFIP-S) data. MFIP-S, instituted by last year'swelfare reform legislation, allows families toaccept lower paying jobs while receiving somepublic assistance. The new law authorizes theflow of information between agencies admin-istering the program to provide the servicesmore efficiently. The new law also permits the Department of Economic Security to provide informationon potential employers to the state's WorkforceCenters. The information is to be used to helpmatch potential employers with those seekingemployment. The law also authorizes, effective Aug. 1, 1998, the release of names and addresses frommotor vehicle registration files to commu-nity-based nonprofit organizations for publicsafety purposes. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) and Sen. DonBetzold (DFL-Fridley). HF1626/SF1378*/CH371 Making health care decisions A plan to consolidate the law regarding health care decision-making is on its way tothe governor following final approval by thefull House April 9. The vote was 75-58. The bill ( HF2521/SF2050* ), sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R- Rochester), is based onthe recommendations of a working group theMinnesota State Bar Association sponsored toreview current law on health care decision-making and to suggest ways to make the lawsmore effective. The group is made up of gov-ernment officials and representatives fromhealth care organizations, consumer groups,and ethical and religious organizations. Currently, a patient can create a document that designates the care to be received if he orshe cannot communicate those wishes. Thedocument is called a living will. In addition, apatient can name a person as his or her du-rable power of attorney, which authorizes thatperson to make health care decisions. Theliving will and durable power of attorney pro-visions are contained in two separate statutes. The bill would combine the living will and the durable power of attorney into one docu-ment called a health care directive. The billprovides the criteria necessary for a directiveto be valid. Bishop said that he brought the proposal forward to make an already existing process Attempted help for state firm Gov. Arne Carlson announced a special ses- sion scheduled for April 20 to revive a billwhich would assist a Minnesota company in apending lawsuit. The bill ( HF3872/SF3416* ) passed the Sen- ate but did not receive a vote on the Housefloor April 9. Supporters could not get enoughvotes to suspend constitutional requirementsso the bill could be rushed through and broughtup for consideration on the last day. Sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy), the bill would affect a lawsuit be-tween Marvin Windows and Doors inWarroad, Minn., and a Pennsylvania com-pany. Marvin Windows is suing the companyfor breach of contract and fraud relating to a wood preservative produced by the Pennsyl-vania company and used by the Minnesotamanufacturer. Among several claims made by Marvin Win- dows, the firm alleges that the other companyengaged in intentional misrepresentation ofits product. Attorneys for Marvin Windowsare attempting to use Minnesota's tort law toaddress these claims in court. The Pennsylvania company argues that this claim cannot be brought forward underMinnesota's tort law, and the company's ar-gument is based on a 1991 law which outlineshow the tort law can be used in contract dis-putes of this sort. The proposed legislation would have ex- panded this provision of law to allow for claimsto move forward in cases where fraud or neg-ligent misrepresentation is evident. Supporters of the bill argued that the change is a clarification of the 1991 law, which did notaddress the issue of fraud. Opponents of the legislation said that the change would undermine the current law be-cause all cases of breach of contract could beconstrued to contain an element of allegedmisrepresentation.Filed without signature30 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Signed by the governoreasier. He said his bill would encourage morepeople to outline their health care wishes be-fore it is too late. Opponents of the bill argued that the change would make it easier to withhold treatmentthat may prolong life from those who areterminally ill. Special guardians, conservators A new law will refine the specialguardian and conservator hearingprocess to prevent potential abuse. Guardians and conservators are appointed by the state courts tomake decisions for adults who are incapable of making decisions for themselves,oftentimes the elderly in nursing homes. Special guardianships and conservatorships differ in that they are temporary arrange-ments designed to respond to short-termsituations. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law length- ens the time required to give notice of hear-ings related to special guardianships andconservatorships from 24 hours to 48 hoursand requires that the hearing be held withintwo weeks of the notice. The law also requires that petitioners show a clear need for the appointment. It also limitsthese appointments to 30 days. Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin), House sponsor of the new measure, said that the ideawas brought to him by members of a family inhis district who felt the process was beingabused by a nursing home caring for theirfather. Sen. Pat Piper (DFL-Austin) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1414/SF1151*/CH281 Protection for news media Gov. Arne Carlson allowed ameasure providing new protec-tions for the news media to be-come law without his signature. However, the governor did take the opportunity to comment on what he referred to as a \"disturbing trend\"in journalism in a letter filed with the bill. Effective April 7, 1998, the new law expands the current media shield law by guaranteeingprotection for reporters' notes and tapes ex-cept in extreme instances. Carlson, in his two page letter, wrote that while the freedom of the press must be main-tained, he is concerned about the lack of ac-countability in journalism, especially withinvestigative journalism. \"News organizations often justify their ac-tivities based on the public's 'right to know,'\" Carlson wrote. \"It is ironic, however, that themedia seldom extend that right to the waythey do business.\" Journalists have no boards of professional responsibility like lawyers, doctors, and ac-countants to ensure ethical behavior, accord-ing to the governor. \"Granting this law's special protection to the news media would be more palatable if itwere a profession that adhered to a strict codeof journalistic conduct,\" Carlson wrote. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul) sponsoredthe new measure. HF1668/SF1480*/CH357 LOCAL GOVERNMENT Filed without signatureFiled without signatureNonprofit corporations A new state law permits Brown County and other political sub-divisions to create nonprofit cor-porations to help with economicdevelopment. The measure has been filed with the secretary of state without the governor'ssignature. It empowers such nonprofit corpo-rations to issue bonds, make grants to compa-nies, and to buy, sell, and develop property. Gov. Arne Carlson allowed the measure to become law, but he clearly did not approve ofits content. \"It gives local governments the power to create entities with broader powers than theentity itself,\" Carlson wrote, in a letter filedwith the measure. \"This is a dangerous prece-dent being established by the Legislature.Moreover, these local entities \u2014 while havinggreater powers than local governments \u2014 arenot subject to some of the same legal require-ments such as open meeting laws, competitivebidding, the Data Practices Act, and the Ethicsin Government Act.\" Carlson also was bothered by the expansion of power to many other nonprofit corpora-tions, which he believes \"has now opened thedoor to widespread misuse by these entities.\" When introduced in the House, the mea- sure applied only to Brown County, but it wasamended to include similar corporations cre-ated elsewhere before June 1, 1997, by allow-ing them to continue to operate. The budget of any such corporation must be made public, and if the corporation is goingto spend $100,000, it has to be approved by thecounty board. The new law took effect April 8, 1998, ex- cept for the section devoted to Brown County,which is retroactive to July 10, 1990.Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) and Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsoredthe measure. HF2700/SF2192*/CH360 Real estate filing fees A plan to create a uniform realestate filing fee structure for coun-ties statewide was vetoed by Gov.Arne Carlson. Carlson said he supports the idea of standardizing such processes acrossthe state. However, he said that he could notsupport the proposal because it would havemeant fee increases. \"Minnesotans already pay a substantial por- tion of their incomes to provide for local,state, and federal services,\" he wrote in hisveto message. \"With no demonstrated needfor these fee increases, I cannot sanction thisbill.\" The bill was sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Sen. DavidTen Eyck (DFL-East Gull Lake). HF1882/SF1654*/CH311 METRO AFFAIRSVetoed by the governor Signed by the governorInnovative bike racks Gov. Arne Carlson signed into lawa measure that allows cities of thefirst class to place art and informa-tional signs on bicycle racks andstorage areas. Effective March 17, 1998, the new law results from a desire by the MinneapolisCity Council to place decorated bicycle rackson every block in the Uptown neighborhoodof the city. The city is trying to promote bicycle riding to ease parking and traffic congestion. Cityofficials want to place art or signs on the racksthat would blend with the Uptown area's at-mosphere that caters to a young clientele. The art and signs will be allowed only if placement does not create a hazard. That de-cision will be left to the road authority thatauthorizes the placement of the art or signage. The new measure was sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. AllanSpear (DFL-Mpls). HF3296/SF2729*/CH283 To find out who represents you at the Capitol . . .

The measure became law without the governor'ssignature. A NATO expansion to include the three countries is anticipated in April 1999, pendingU. S. approval. President Clinton supports theexpansion, and the U.S. Senate is expectedback the plan. The Minnesota proposal was originally sponsored by Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth),who spent about two months translating forNATO troops in northeastern Bosnia lastsummer. \"My idea is that every country should join NATO, and then once everybody is joined insupport of peace, we won't need any morearmies,\" he said. Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2417*/SF2055/Res.5Filed without signature TAXES Omnibus tax bill The 1998 omnibus tax bill includes some tax relief for almost everyone \u2014 includinghomeowners, renters, business owners, apart-ment owners, cities building convention cen-ters, charitable gambling organizations, andsenior citizens. The House passed the bill in the final hours of the 1998 session April 9. The vote was100-33. The bill would provide $500 million in re- bates to Minnesota taxpayers, but critics saidthat wasn't enough and called for more of the$1.9 billion state surplus to be returned totaxpayers. Bill supporters said some surplus funds should be returned, some should be saved,and some should be used for major buildingprojects. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), who chairs the House Taxes Committee and sponsored thetax bill, urged lawmakers to support the finalbill produced by a House-Senate conferencecommittee. \"We've worked long and hard. The bill is the result of compromise on both sides,\" shesaid. \". . . In this bill, we provide about $1.2 billion to be returned to the taxpayers ofthe state of Minnesota. This is a bill that willhelp all Minnesotans.\" But Rep. H. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth), who was consistent throughout the session incalling for permanent income tax reductions,found fault with the bill. \"I think the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back is not what they've done with thetax dollars that already have been paid,\" hesaid. \"What the DFL is doing is erasing thehope. [The bill] prevents any future tax cuts.We've committed the dollars to be spent al-ready. It's highly, highly unusual.\" Van Dellen was referring to a clause in the bill that would direct that the first $400 mil-lion of any surplus after the $822 milliondesignated for budget reserves and tax reformand reductions be used to reduce bonding topay for capital projects. House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL- Fulda) tried to answer the bill's critics. The billmeets the needs of Minnesota families, hesaid. \"They said, 'We need some help,' and we're giving them some help,\" Winter said. \"We'retaking a long time to look at all the needs of thestate of Minnesota. We've got bigger budgetreserves than we've ever had.\" Here are some highlights of the bill (HF3840*/SF2985 ), which Gov. Arne Carlson has indicated he will sign. Property tax rebates The bill would provide a rebate for homeowners and renters equal to 20 percentof the property taxes paid in 1998, similar tothe rebate in effect for property taxes paid byhomeowners and renters in 1997. The maxi-mum rebate would be $1,500. The rebate wouldbe allowed as a refundable income tax credit tobe claimed on the 1998 income tax return filedin 1999. In the earlier version of the bill approved by the House, there was a proposal for an addi-tional rebate to be sent out later this fall thatwould equal 50 percent of the regular 1997rebate. The \"no-wait rebate\" is not part of theconference committee version of the bill. Property tax reform Property taxes for homeowners, businesses, and others would be reduced, under the finalversion of the bill. The tax classification rate for the second tier of residential homestead property (value over$75,000) would go from 1.85 percent to1.7 percent. The class rate of the first $115,000 in market value of agricultural homestead propertywould go from 0.4 percent to 0.35 percent.The class rate on the market value over $115,000 and under 320 acres would go from0.9 percent to 0.8 percent. There also would be a break for owners of commercial and industrial property. Class rateson that property valued up to $150,000 wouldgo from 2.7 percent to 2.45 percent. The uppertier, over $150,000, would go from 4 percentto 3.5 percent. Owners of apartment buildings with four or more units would see their class rates go from2.9 percent to 2.5 percent, and owners ofrental houses would see their class rates gofrom 1.9 percent to 1.25 percent for the firsttier of property value, and from 2.1 percent to1.7 percent on the upper tier. Property taxes, local bonding, levy authority Counties that saw a reduction in the prop- erty tax base of at least 5 percent because of the1997 floods would get \"replacement aid\" un-der the bill, equal to the tax base loss multi-plied by the payable 1998 county government'saverage tax rate. Owners of deteriorating homes needing at least $20,000 worth of repairs in \"marginal\"neighborhoods, would get a five-year exemp-tion on their property taxes if they undertakerehabilitation. The program would apply onlyto the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul, andDuluth, and would last until May 1, 2003. Those homes would have to be in an area where the median home value is less than80 percent of the median value for the entirecity. Homes would be required to have anestimated market value of less than 60 percentof the median value for the entire city. Senior citizens' property tax deferral Seniors would no longer be required to complete a form every year to participate in aproperty tax deferral program for the elderly.Once enrolled in the program, seniors wouldneed only to notify the state by July 1 if theirincome exceeds the limit for the program.Information alerting taxpayers of the avail-ability of the senior deferral program will be inthe property tax refund instruction booklet,beginning with those prepared in 1998 and onthe property tax statements. Under the program, seniors making less than $30,000 a year can delay paying the por-tion of their property tax that is more than 5 percent of their income. The delay can lastuntil they sell the property. Then, it has to bepaid back with interest. Sales and excise taxes The 2.5 percent sales tax on farm machin- ery, which includes logging and fish farmingequipment would be phased out. The tax would go to 2 percent June 30, 1998,32 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998to 1 percent June 30, 1999, and to nothing after June 30, 2000. The bill provides for a variety of sales tax exemptions at various building projectsthroughout the state. It would extend the salestax exemption for purchases of constructionmaterials, supplies, or equipment that are usedin any expansion at the Duluth Entertainmentand Convention Center. That exemption wasto have expired Dec. 31, 1998. The same sales tax exemption would go into effect for the expansion at the MinneapolisConvention Center and the RiverCentre in St. Paul. The latter will be the new home of the National Hockey League's Minnesota Wild,which will begin play in 2000. The city of Duluth also would be allowed to raise its local lodging and restaurant taxesfrom 1 percent to 1.5 percent to help pay forimprovements at the city's convention center. Budget reserves The budget reserve would be brought to $622 million, and the bill would establish a taxreform and reduction account. The governorwould make suggestions to the Legislature onthe tax reform and reduction account's use. After the $622 million in reserve, $200 million of surplus funds would be put in thattax reform and reduction account for tax re-ductions. The next $400 million of a futuresurplus would be used to help pay for capitalprojects in the 1998 bonding bill. Gaming taxes The bill would make several changes to the tax on lawful gambling. The $12 million exemption from pari- mutuel tax would not end June 30, 1999, asoriginally planned. Also, pari-mutuel licenseholders would not have to return the value ofunredeemed tickets after Jan. 1, 2000. The tax rate on lawful gambling operations, which applies to gross receipts less prizes paid,would drop 5 percent. Federal update The tax bill would adopt for the state, changes made by the federal Taxpayer ReliefAct of 1997. The bill would get state law in line with federal provisions that allow taxpayers to de-duct interest from their state tax forms onstudent loans for the first five years interest isdue on the loans. The maximum deduction is$1,000 in 1998, $1,500 in 1999, $2,000 in 2000,and $2,500 in 2001. Under the bill, those de-ductions could be claimed on state taxes aswell as federal taxes. The bill also would accommodate the fed-eral Education IRA, a $500 per beneficiary non-deductible IRA to be used for thebeneficiary's higher education. And, finally, the bill would shape state law to fit the federal government's new \"Roth\"IRA. Under the federal program, contribu-tions are not deductible, but distributions arenot taxed if it's distributed at least five yearsafter the account was established and after age59-and-a-half, death, disability, or a first-timehome purchase. TOURISMSigned by the governorProperty tax rebate Effective March 19, 1998, a newstate law ensures homeowners whoprepaid their 1997 property taxescan claim a rebate allowed under alaw passed last year. The 1997 Legislature, flush with a projected $2.3 billion budget surplus, passeda one-time tax rebate to give some of thatsurplus back to homeowners and renters. Therebate was linked to property taxes paid in1997. However, that created a problem for those who paid their 1997 property taxes beforeJan. 1, 1997. Homeowners sometimes pre-paytheir taxes to claim an itemized deduction forthe previous year's income tax. Under the 1997 law, people who prepaid were out of luck, because the measure limitedpayment of the rebate to those who paid theirproperty taxes in 1997. The new law allows the property tax rebate to be paid to all taxpayers who paid their 1997property taxes before Jan. 1, 1998. The rebate is available to both homeowners and renters. For homeowners, it comes to 20percent of their property taxes, and for rent-ers, 3.6 percent of their rent paid. Althoughthe rebate is a property tax rebate, it is claimedon the state income tax returns filed this year.The rebate is separate from the regular prop-erty tax refund that many renters andhomeowners get in August of each year. Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Douglas Johnson (DFL-Tower) spon-sored the new measure. HF2294/SF2041*/CH304 Fishing dispute resolution A resolution asking PresidentClinton and the U.S. Congress tohelp settle fishing-rights disputesbetween Minnesota and the Ca-nadian province of Ontario hasbeen filed with the Office of the Secretary of State without the governor's signature. The resolution urges the federal govern- ment to seek a solution to the border troublesthat have spawned a proposal to allowMinnesota's Northwest Angle to secede fromthe United States. The approximately 85 year-round residents of the Northwest Angle have complained foryears about Canadian policies including fishlimits, user fees, and border crossing permitsthat they say discriminate against U.S. anglers. The Northwest Angle, the northernmost spot of the continental U.S., is actually apeninsula on Lake of the Woods that is at-tached only to Canada. According to Canadian law, tourists fishing the two-thirds of the lake in Canada, andstaying in Canadian resorts, may keep up totwo walleye or sauger per day. But beginningthis summer, anglers staying at U.S. resortswill not be allowed to keep either of those fishif pulled from Canadian waters. Canadianssay the regulations are needed because thespecies are overfished, but Americans say theyare driven by a desire to force tourists to stayat Canadian resorts. U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) intro- duced a constitutional amendment in Marchthat would let the Angle and nearby islandsseparate from the United States, allowing resi-dents and tourists to enjoy the Canadian fish-ing privileges. Peterson said he sees secession as a long shot but that he sponsored the proposal in order tobring attention to the plight of affected an-glers. He also said the Canadian regulationsviolate a 1909 border-waters treaty and theNorth American Free Trade Agreement butthat the federal government has not takenaction to protect U.S. rights in the area. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls)sponsored the legislation. HF3854*/SF3406/Res.8 Filed without signatureTRANSPORTATION Signed by the governorOmnibus transportation Gov. Arne Carlson got many of theextra state troopers he had wantedfor two years when he signed a $51million omnibus transportationplan into law. The new law also allows the De- partment of Transportation to spend up to$40 million on new highway projects. And thelaw will create a task force designed to catchMinnesota residents who illegally register theirvehicles in neighboring states.33 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYRep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston) and Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch) spon-sored the legislation. Here is a look at major provisions of the new law. All of the provisions detailed below areeffective July 1, 1998. HF3057/SF3298*/CH372 State troopers The governor had originally requested 47 additional state troopers and support staff at acost of $5.25 million. In 1996, the governorsought funds to hire an additional 46 statetroopers, but the Legislature approved onlyenough funding for four state patroldispatchers. Under the new law, there will be $2.7 mil- lion in funding for 29 new state troopers, andthere is $200,000 for additional state patrolhelicopter flight time. Legislators were told helicopter patrols, which are currently used only on Friday andSaturday nights, are perhaps the greatest singleboost ground patrols receive in law enforce-ment efforts. The funding will allow the pa-trols to fly during weekday evenings as well. The state patrol's current complement is 535 troopers, including 37 that are expected toshortly graduate from training. The new troop-ers would increase the allowable force limitto 564. Highway projects A total of $40 million will be appropriated from the trunk highway fund for highwayconstruction projects in fiscal year 1999. Another $6.8 million from the trunk fund will be available for design engineering andconstruction engineering. Also, the new law stipulates that the town bridge account may be used to pay the cost ofabandoning an existing bridge that is deficientbut will not be replaced. The account also will be used to pay to construct a road or street to facilitate the aban-donment of a deficient bridge if it is deter-mined the construction of the road or street ismore cost-efficient than replacing the existingbridge. Lake Street planning board A provision in the new law will establish a 13-member board to help plan and coordi-nate development of the Lake Street corridorin Minneapolis. The board would have juris-diction over one-half mile on either side ofLake Street. The board's purpose will be to concentrate on economic development, transportation,and residential renewal in the area in coordi-nation with local government, businesses, andother neighborhood entities.If light rail transit becomes a reality in the state, this area is expected to be affected by theHiawatha Corridor of the transit line. The members will have a three-year term ending June 30, 2001. Registration task force A dealer licensing and motor vehicle regis- tration enforcement task will be created, un-der the new law. A total of $50,000 from the highway user tax distribution fund will be allocated to thecommissioner of public safety, who is to des-ignate four state highway patrol members toinvestigate the incidence of vehicle registra-tion evasion and dealer fraud. It is believed countless Minnesota residents register their motor vehicles in neighboringstates, which have lower licensing fees. Esti-mates indicate this costs the state millionsannually, even though it is a gross misde-meanor for vehicles owned and operated inMinnesota to be registered in another state. The task force's final report is to go to the governor and the Legislature by Feb. 15, 1999.The task force expires July 1, 2000. Ignoring highway barricades Driving on roads closed because of storms could become costly, under a bill the Housepassed April 9. The vote was 117-14 . The bill ( HF2589/SF2592* ) would stipu- late that any motorist who becomes strandedafter bypassing a barricade or law enforce-ment officer placed to restrict travel on a road-way during or after a storm could pay up to$10,000 in expenses incurred during any res-cue efforts. The cost of such rescues has typically been about $2,000. Law enforcement officers havesometimes put their lives at risk during suchrescues. Drivers would be liable if they failed to obey the instruction of authorized personnel at theroadway entrance, or if they drove around orthrough a barricade placed to stop travel on aclosed portion of a roadway. Another part of the bill would make it a misdemeanor to drive around a lowered rail-way gate. The bill stipulates all drivers muststop when railway gates are lowered and notcontinue until they are raised. Under currentlaw, drivers who bypass a lowered railway gateface a misdemeanor charge only if it is deter-mined it was unsafe to do so. The bill also would establish criteria for a business that wants its name or logo posted ona roadway panel. Such panels are typicallylocated near interstate freeway exits and indi-cate gasoline stations or restaurants are nearby.Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) is the spon- sor of the legislation, which awaits action bythe governor. Bowe Memorial Highway For the first time in Minnesota his-tory, a stretch of highway will benamed after a slain state trooper. Gov. Arne Carlson signed into law a measure that will rename a stretch of Trunk Highway 95 after Cpl. Timo-thy Bowe. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law requires the commissioner of transportation to adopt adesign and to erect the signs to mark thememorial highway. The signs will be paid forby the community of Cambridge, Minn. Last year, Bowe became the first Minnesota State Patrol officer killed in the line of dutysince 1978. The 36-year-old Coon Rapids manwas shot to death in Chisago County whileanswering a call about a shooting at a ruralhome. Bowe, a 15-year veteran, was the seventh Minnesota trooper killed in the line of duty. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch) spon-sored the measure.

Signed by the governor34 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Making vehicles available Nonprofit organizations that sell or lease inexpensive cars no longerneed to apply for a motor vehicledealer's license, under a new lawthat took effect March 19, 1998. Certain charitable organizations repair and recondition older vehicles that aredonated to them. These groups then sell thevehicles at low prices to people moving off publicassistance or to other low-income people. The new law exempts these organization from needing a dealer's license. Under the law, the cash value of the vehicle being sold must be less than $1,000 and theorganization must meet the requirements of anonprofit charitable group under the tax codeto get the exemption. The law could make more vehicles available for people at a time when welfare recipientsare being encouraged to find employmentunder welfare reform measures that took ef-fect in 1997. Many of these people do not havetransportation, according to Rep. TimPawlenty (R-Eagan), who sponsored the mea-sure in the House. Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) spon- sored the legislation in the Senate. HF3028/SF2163*/CH285Signed by the governorSigned by the governor Signed by the governorSirens and flashing red lights A new law will reinstate a safetyrequirement for ambulances. Effective Aug. 1, 1998, the new law will require all medical emer-gency vehicles to both sound anaudible signal and activate red emergency lights while responding to emer-gencies. Medical vehicles that are transport-ing patients in non-emergency situations willnot be required to sound their alarms. In 1997, legislation to exempt law enforce- ment officers from the requirement to soundaudible signals while responding to emergencycalls included language that also exemptedemergency medical vehicles. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), House sponsor of the new measure, said that after the1997 law was approved, insurance carriersbegan telling owners of emergency medicalvehicles that rates for coverage would rise ifboth audible and visible signals were not usedwhile responding to emergencies. Proponents argued that it is safer for ambu- lance drivers, other motorists, and pedestri-ans to have the audible warning in addition toflashing red lights. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF2576/SF2028*/CH263No more fingerprint checks Those with direct management re-sponsibility for a company's haz-ardous waste transportation no longer must submit a full set of fingerprints to determine if theperson has a criminal record under a law effective March 24, 1998. Ward Briggs, of the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the hazardous wastetransportation industry objected to the re-quirement, calling it a nuisance. He also saidthe background check involving fingerprintshad been part of a national pilot program thathad expired. Briggs said the fingerprint checks were not proven to be the best method of evaluating thebackground of those involved with theintrastate transport of hazardous waste. Hesaid some with a criminal record were slippingby despite the checks. Briggs said other methods of accomplishing better background checks are currently understudy, and a national system for such a processis expected soon. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) sponsoredthe measure. HF2665/SF2316*/CH310 Filed without signatureVETERANS Signed by the governorGulf War veterans' bonuses A new law effective Feb. 26, 1998,allows the state's Department ofVeterans Affairs to consider docu-ments other than a veteran's mili-tary discharge form in determiningan applicant's eligibility for a state bonus program for Persian Gulf Warveterans. In 1997, the Legislature passed a law setting aside $17 million to give Minnesota's approxi-mately 44,000 Persian Gulf War veterans abonus for their military service in Desert Storm.Veterans receive bonuses at three levels:Approximately 13,000 who served within awar zone are eligible to get $600. Another30,500 who were preparing to be shipped over-seas can get $300, and the families of the nineMinnesota soldiers killed in the war each areeligible for $2,000. Problems arose when the process used by the veterans affairs department to determineeligibility was causing benefit delays of up tosix months. Under the new law, the department can use \u2014 in the place of military discharge forms \u2014other reliable documentation proving mili-tary service. The documents must be approvedby the department. Minnesota veterans who served in the mili- tary between Aug. 2, 1990, and July 31, 1991,are eligible. Applications will be accepted un-til June 30, 1999, and are available throughgroups such as the American Legion and theVeterans of Foreign Wars. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) and Sen. Jim Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) sponsoredthe legislation.

The resolution supports a congressional ef- fort to force foreign repair facilities to use thesame standards that apply to domestic aircraftrepair procedures and parts. Some aviation experts are concerned that airplane repair facilities in foreign countriesuse defective parts or do substandard repairwork on U.S. airplanes. Federal legislation before the U.S. Congress aims to tighten controls on repair facilitiesthat service aircraft that operate in the UnitedStates. The act would revoke certification ofany repair facility that purposely usesuncertified or substandard parts. Rep. Edwina Garcia (DFL-Richfield) and Sen.

Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) stopped toassess things. When he ran in 1994, Kraus said he would stay in office only for two or three terms, andlast week he paused to consider running for athird term. He decided the answer is no. \"My business has grown and with the help of my family and friends I came to the deci-sion,\" he said. The decision was reached overseveral days following the end of the session. Kraus, 41, owns Kraus Foods, which oper- ates Dairy Queen restaurants and conveniencestores in Iowa and Minnesota. He said that onoccasion, he'll even take his turn at dishing upthe soft-serve. \"My family is important to me and I want to spend more time with them and my business,\"Kraus said. \"Although it feels really good tohelp people by serving them in the Legislature,there is no better feeling than the one I getcreating real, meaningful jobs here at home.That's where I'm going to focus myattention.\" Successful legislation Kraus carried includes a law that requires school superintendent can-didates to tell the hiring school board if theyhad ever been bought out of a previous jobcontract. He also was able to get $800,000 forthe Blazing Star Trail, $250,000 for Albert Leaschools to develop a unique kindergarten andfirst-grade pilot program, and a $250,000\"Mighty Ducks\" grant for a second ice sheet inAlbert Lea, Minn. Kraus served on several House committees \u2014 Education, Taxes, Agriculture, and LocalGovernment and Metropolitan Affairs \u2014 dur-ing his legislative career. He said his favorite was the Taxes Commit- tee, which was particularly busy this past ses-Rep. Ron Kraus . . . House member returns home to create jobs' sion, having to deal with a pro-jected $1.9 billion surplus in statecoffers. \"In my two years [on that com- mittee], I was proud of the way wedid some reductions in commer-cial and industrial [property] taxrates,\" \"I think the[property tax] rebates were a goodidea. I would like to have gonedeeper. When you compromisewith the committee as a whole, Ithink both sides achieve somegood things.\" The 1998 omnibus tax bill, which Gov. Arne Carlson has in-dicated he will sign, includes $500million in property tax rebatesand cuts in commercial and in-dustrial tax rates. Kraus and otherRepublicans fought for deepercuts. Kraus said he is leaving with- out regrets, despite the fact thathe was in the minority caucusthroughout his time in office. \"It's a wonderful opportunity to serve people. I would encour-age anybody to serve this way. Idon't leave with any bad feelings,\"he said. Kraus said he will miss his fellow legislators, and after he made his announcement early onApril 16, he got \"pages of responses from . . .colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \"I leave feeling I have good friends on both sides of the aisle,\" he said. Out of gratitude to his constituents, Kraus and his wife, Kathy, have pledged $5,000 to theYouth in Government Program at the YMCAin Albert Lea. Rep. Ron Kraus is leaving the House after two terms. \"We want young people to know that public service is something that is good,\" Kraus said. One tradition Kraus is determined to keep alive is the annual Dilly Bar Day in the Legis-lature. As an owner of Dairy Queen franchises,he was able to supply his colleagues with thepopular treat on the designated day \u2014 and hedid it for four years. Next year, he said, he'll encourage his suc- cessor to adhere to the same tradition.

Both women have stories to tell of people who have come to depend on the new technol-ogy. \"Most of our staff have had someone come up to them saying 'I'm sure what I'm lookingfor doesn't exist because I've looked all overthe Web and can't find it,'\" Cathcart said. \"Butlibrary staff can lead them right to a book onthe shelf with exactly the information theyneed.\" Still, if a report that's germane to a particu- lar public-policy issue is available on the Web,chances are it's available via links from thelibrary's home page. LaFleur says those simple online link con- nections have had a particularly big impact onthe library's resource guides called Resourceson Minnesota's Legislative Issues. Each guide contains a list of related stateand national articles, reports, references to Internet materials, and other resources per-taining to a topic of legislative concern. Before the library began publishing on the Web, the guides existed in paper form. \"Butthe trouble is that as soon as you commitsomething to print, it's out of date,\" LaFleursaid. Now the guides can be accessed via the library's home page. They are updated fre-quently and, if referenced materials are avail-able online, they can be reached via a quickclick of the mouse. Electronic publishing is changing the way the library builds its collection. Cathcart says that within the past year, most state and federal agencies have begun offeringmuch more information online. But, becauseof the sometimes temporary nature of Internet-published documents, she says, the library stillmakes every effort to secure a printed copy ofall Minnesota state agency reports for its col-lection. Providing the most complete collection available of Minnesota public policy docu-ments is, after all, one of the library's roles. But it's in the area of accessing those and related documents that the Internet has sup-plied the greatest boost. \"The most exciting and rewarding aspect is the ability to meet people's needs immedi-ately,\" LaFleur said. Cathcart tells the story of a legislator who called last year, needing a copy of a Texasreport before a committee hearing convenedin two hours. \"Not only could I find the report on the Web, but I was able to e-mail the author withmy questions and get a reply,\" she said. \"In thepast, I would have had to call to get the report, maybe send a letter to ask questions.\" But despite the better accessibility, the in- creased scope of online resources continues tochallenge library staff. \"The hard part is managing the informa- tion, because there's just so much more of it,and finding ways to let users know what we'vegot,\" said Cathcart. There are plans in the works to streamline, via the Internet, one of the library's estab-lished systems for alerting users to resources. The system is called Inside Issues, and it allows lawmakers and staff to submit a list oftopics about which library staff, who regularlyscan incoming periodicals, can alert them ofrelated articles. Currently, staff sends out a weekly list the old-fashioned, hard copy way, but Cathcartand LaFleur say they may have that convertedto e-mail by next session. \"So far we haven't felt the timing was right for that \u2014 there just hasn't been that mass oflegislators and staff who were familiar with thetechnology \u2014 but now we think the time isright,\" LaFleur said. In fact, Cathcart says, the idea of putting the Inside Issues alerts on e-mail came up six yearsago, when library staff drew up a fantasy list ofall the things they hoped to coordinate online. Also in the wings for online conversion is the series of notebooks containing informa-tion on all former legislators. \"That's our next big data project, creating that data base online,\" Cathcart said. Already, staff is in the process of adding its extensive records of everything form guber-natorial vetoes to caucus-strength data to thelibrary's Web page. On the sixth floor of the State Office Building, the Legislative Reference Library offers the state's most complete collection of Minnesota state-agency documents.Legislative Reference Library . . . Internet provides one more place to find information37 April 17, 1998 / SESSION WEEKLYLaFleur says the library staff has accepted the role of being the Capitol Internet experts,and now offers both formal and informalInternet training classes. Library staff members have long lent their talent and skills to organizing the Legislature'sWeb site. They have collaborated with House,Senate, and Office of the Revisor of Statutesstaff since the site's 1994 inception. \"For example, we help staff from the revisor's office design the forms for searching the billsand statutes,\" LaFleur said. \"They know UNIX [operating system] and we know what peoplewant UNIX to do.\" And although Internet access has increased speed and resource possibilities for the li-brary, the 20-member staff still has its handsfull managing the library's print collection. Managing the collection \u2014 sifting out out- dated materials \u2014 takes up a big chunk oftime. Both women say they have the experi-enced, dedicated staff to thank for that.\"We're very cognizant that we don't want to provide outdated material, and we're also verycognizant of remaining nonpartisan,\" Cathcartsaid. \"We take that very seriously.\" Library patrons will attest to the staff's knowledge and helpfulness. As Cathcart said,\"We take every inquiry seriously. We knowpeople aren't just coming in and asking idlequestions.\" In a cramped room in the basement of the State Office Building, Paul VanCura issurrounded by overflowing stacks ofbooks, journals, and tapes. As senior reference assistant for the Leg- islative Reference Library, it's his day topreside over the Tape Listening Library,where the public has access to audio re-cordings of all House and Senate commit-tee hearings and floor sessions since 1973. Actually the older tapes are stored across the freeway in the Minnesota History Cen-ter, but copies of proceedings from aboutthe past 10 years can be found in RoomG-71 of the State Office Building. VanCura says an average of eight to 12 people a day pay a visit to the tape room tohear or record a portion of past legislativeactivities.\"For the most part, people want to find out what the intent of the Legislature waswhen it passed a certain law,\" he said.\"Most of our visitors are from the legalcommunity \u2014 lawyers or law clerks.\" While the service has been available for more than two decades, VanCurasays recent Internet access has made re-searching via tapes a far less cumbersomeactivity than it used to be. The process used to entail up to an hour of flipping through the MinnesotaStatutes, the Laws of Minnesota, and theHouse and Senate journals. After cross-referencing bill numbers in those threevolumes, researchers could determinewhich hearings or floor sessions theyneeded to hear.Today, for accessing pre-1996 proceed- ings, the same process applies, but forrecent years, a two-minute visit to theLegislature's home page on the WorldWide Web will pull up a complete list ofevery hearing or floor session a particularbill went through. An at-home researcher could then or- der tape copies by telephone from Houseor Senate supply offices. Or they could pay a visit to staff in the basement tape library where a row of au-dio machines \u2014 both reel-to-reel ma-chines for older years and cassettemachines for newer recordings \u2014 allowpatrons to listen to or tape recordings freeof charge.

Photos by Tom Olmscheid and Laura Phillips40 SESSION WEEKLY / April 17, 1998Exactly 3,051 bills were introduced by the Legislature during the regular session \u2014 1,629 by the House and 1,422 by the Senate. Of those, 157 bills (and four resolutions) were passed by both bodies during the 1998 Legislative Session and sent to the governor. So what happened to the other 2,890 bills? Some were duplicates, some were folded into other bills, but most are dead, gone from the legislative process unless they are reintroduced next year. The biennium has ended, and bills do not carryover from one biennium to the next. And what happened to the 157 bills (and four resolutions) that have been sent to the governor? Most were signed into law, some are awaiting the governor'saction, and some were vetoed. Here's a quick review of the governor's veto authority during the second year of the biennium. Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The governor has several options when considering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which at the end of the biennium, results in a pocket veto. The timing of these actions is as important as the actions themselves. If a bill was passed by the Legislature and presented to the governor before the final three days of the session, the bill will become law unless the governor vetoes it by returning it to the Legislature within three days. The governor normally signs the bills and files them with the secretary of state, but his signature is not required. If a bill is passed during the last three days of the session, the governor has a longer time to act on it. He/she must sign and deposit it with the secretary of state within 14 days of adjournment or the bill will not become law. Inaction by thegovernor results in a \"pocket veto,\" and the governor is not required to provide a reason for the veto. Only on appropriations bills can the governor exercise the line-item veto authority. This option allows the governor to eliminate the appropriation items to which he/she objects. As with all vetoes, the governor must include a statement listing the reasons for the veto with the returned bill. Here, too, the timetable iseither 14 days after adjournment for bills passed during the final three days of the session, or within three days after the governor receives the bill at any other time. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But because only the governor can call a special session of the Legislature, anything vetoed after the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 unless it is re-introduced next year. After each session, a comprehensive summary of all bills that were signed into law or vetoed is published. You can obtain a copy of New Laws 1998 by calling or writing the House Public Information Office, 175 State Office Building, St. Paul,MN 55155-1298; (612) 296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550.Now it's up to the governorEditor's note: The following chart includes the 157 bills (and four resolutions) that passedboth the House and the Senate and have beensent on to the governor for consideration.Final action is as yet incomplete on 25 of thebills. The bills are, for the most part, sortedaccording to the committee of origin. Here are definitions of some of the terms used in the chart.

In the mid- to late-1800s, the timber in- dustry was paramount in Minnesota. \"Pine became the synonym of wealth and power. These, with the Falls of St. Anthonyas an operating center, held sway over everypine-fringed stream and lake that flowedfrom the north, and with their virile forcefloated into the politics of the state,\" wroteJames H. Baker in his book Lives of the Governors of Minnesota . Clough was born in New Hampshire in 1846. His father, a lumberman and a farmer, wasdrawn westward by the promise of Minnesota'svast white pine forests. In 1857, the family settledat Spencer Brook in Isanti County. One of 14 children, Clough spent his summers on the farm and winters at thelumber camps; there wasn't much time forschool. What he lacked in formal educa-tion, he made up for with common sense,ambition, and a good smile. In 1868, he married his childhood sweet- heart and moved to Minneapolis where heand his oldest brother established a lumbercompany at St. Anthony Falls.Lumber baron leaves pine forests for governor post Gov. David Marston Clough An active Republican since his youth, Clough spent several terms on the Minne-apolis City Council and in the MinnesotaSenate. He also served as Gov. KnuteNelson's lieutenant governor. In 1895,Nelson was elected to the U.S. Senate andClough settled into the big chair. \"Certainly no man not possessed of tal- ent and tact could, in so short a time, withbut little education, have vaulted from thepineries of the north into the gubernato-rial chair,\" wrote one early biographer. Clough's administration, though noted for few laws, approved several importantconstitutional amendments: Womengained the right to vote for and serve onlibrary boards. The pardon board was cre-ated. And an amendment was passed tomake it more difficult to amend the con-stitution.The cornerstone for the third and cur- rent state Capitol was set in place duringthe Clough era, but perhaps his most last-ing accomplishment was the establishmentof a constitutionally protected state fundto assist in constructing county roads andbridges. \"Men of all classes perceive that the continued prosperity of the state, and es-pecially of the agricultural sections, de-mands the early adoption of efficientmeasures for improving the condition ofour highways,\" he said in his first biennialmessage. Lingering resentments from three de- cades of Minneapolis politics resulted inthe only blemish on Clough's politicalrecord: He turned on a fellow Republicanduring the 1898 governor's race. Clough so despised the Republican can- didate, William H. Eustis, of Minneapolis,that he openly supported aDemocrat. When won, Clough senthim a telegram: \"Allow me to congratulateyou from the bottom of my heart. There isstill a God in Heaven.\" Clough left politics for pine trees in 1899. He moved west in search of virginforests and lived out the remainder of hisdays building an international lumberempire on the Washington coast.45 April 1998 Members List as of January 28, 1998 Note: Room numbers are subject to change. *All rooms are in the State Office Building, St. Paul, MN 5515545A Abrams, Ron (R) ..........................................
