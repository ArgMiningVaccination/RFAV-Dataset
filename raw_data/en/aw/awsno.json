The University is committed to the principles that each stud ent deserves personal attention and that all members of the academic community must have freedom to pursue independent thought and to exercise intellectual curiosity.

Members of the Board of Trustees, principal administrative officers, administrative staff, and faculty are listed in the back of this catalog. History When the Rev. Milton Kroger Little drove a claim -stake into a barren 50 - acre tract of land east of Fort Worth in 1890, even the most visionary supporter of the new college could not have imagined the university that would come into being . From that inauspicious beginning, Texas Wesleyan has successfully taught generations of leaders how to rise to a challenge and get a job done. They did it with class and c ompassion, a n attitude earning the university a Texas -sized reputation that has only grown in recent years. THE POLY YEARS 1891- 1914 When Polytechnic College of the Methodist Episcopal Church South opened its doors in September 1891, it boasted a 25- acre campus, a wooden dorm, an A -frame chapel and a brick classroom building to serve its 105 students and 11 faculty. It was among a growing number of colleges embracing a new way of thinking about education \u2014 adding training in commerce and industry to a cla ssic education in the arts and letters, thus \"poly,\" or many. Students would receive practical training in business and professional life that would serve as a pipeline to the growing industrial base in Fort Worth, hence \"technic.\" The University 23 TEXAS WOMAN'S COLLEGE 1914-1935 On May 13, 1914, trustees changed Poly to Texas Woman's College. That September, 317 girls and eight faculty members began classes on a campus with six buildings. During the 1920s, the tradition of robing, which commemorates the relationship betw een faculty and students through a ceremonial vesting of cap and gown, became a University tradition. The tradition remains to this day, and is an example of Texas Wesleyan's dedication to a small, personal educational atmosphere. Faced with dwindling reso urces during the Depression, trustees voted to close the school in 1931. However, a merger with the financial ly secure Texas Wesleyan Academy in Austin kept the doors open and created the new, co-educational institution of Texas Wesleyan College in 1934. TEXAS WESLEYAN COLLEG E 1935- 1989 In the fall of 1934, women returned to campus to find men attending classes. The men increased enrollment by 51 percent. The following March, trustees changed the name one more time, to Texas Wesleyan College, maintaining t he initials TWC. The little college would bear the name proudly for 54 years. In addition to strong undergraduate programs, the University added graduate programs in education in the 1970s, and nurse anesthesia and graduate business programs in the 1980s. The Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia, accredited by the Council of Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia, is the largest in the country. Recognizing the growth in programs, trustees changed the name of the institution to Texas Wesleyan University, effecti ve in January 1989. TEXAS WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY 1989- PRESENT Texas Wesleyan has historically combined service to a residential population along with its strong commitment to a commuting and adult population. To add flexibility in the scheduling of courses a nd to recognize the special needs of adult learners, the University added the Weekend/Evening Program in 1994. The University established a campus in downtown Fort Worth in 1997 with the relocation of the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, which was established in 1992 and fully accredited by the American Bar Association. In 2013, Texas Wesleyan University School of Law was acquired by Texas A&M University. Texas Wesleyan continues to grow in the 21 st century. The psychology department moved into its new home, the Nenetta Burton Carter Building in 2001, and a new building for the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia opened in 2003. A graduate program in counseling was added in 2004. In 2005, Texas Wes leyan opened its first apartment -style dormitory for students and completed renovations of the Polytechnic United Methodist Church . In 2007, the Ed and Rae Schollmaier Science and Technology Center opened as well as the Louella Baker -Martin Pavilion. In 20 08, the historic Baker Building was renovated, and Texas Wesleyan established the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice and, in 2009, the Doctor of Education . In 2010, the Claudia Stepp Scene shop opened for use by the theatre department, and the Universi ty unveiled the new Jack and Jo Willa Morton Fitness Center. A Doctor of Philosophy in Marriage and Family Therapy was established in 2014. As a part of the 2020 Vision, the University completed the Rosedale Renaissance, the first major revitalization of East Fort Worth in several generations , in 2015. This multi -million dollar project was a partnership with the City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County and the North Central Texas Texas Wesleyan University 24 Council of Governments . It created a new front door to the U niversity, renovated t he historic Polytechnic Firehouse, created a new Community Counseling Center and revitalized East Rosedale. In addition, the project brought the United Methodist Church Central Texas Conference Service Center and the bishop's offices to the Texas Wesleyan University campus. The Campus Texas Wesleyan University maintains a historic campus in east Fort Worth. The campus includes more than 83 acres four miles southeast of downtown and is located on one of the highest points in the city. The heritage of Texas Wesleyan is reflected in some of the historic buildings with Georgian -style columns, while progress is seen in the contemporary design of the newer buildings. Wesleyan also has a satellite location south of Fort Worth in the city of Burleson. This mixture of old and new is reflected in all aspects of Texas Wesleyan University's life where new and innovative ideas complement more than a century of traditions. As a part of the Texas Wesleyan's 2020 vision, the University is completing major upgrades throughout the campus. James C.

Through the years, these speakers have delivered messages that have challenged and inspired thousands of Texas Wesleyan students and faculty members. ROBING AND HOODING CONVOCATION From the time this institution was founded in 1890, a strong bond has united members of the faculty with members of the student body. This close relationship has developed because of the desire of the faculty to teach more than the subject matter and because Texas Wesl eyan University students have wanted to learn and understand the beliefs, philosophies, and attitudes of the instructors and professors. Throughout the more than 100 years of the University's history, it has been recognized that if the student is to receiv e an education and if the faculty is to maintain an appropriate perspective on that process, this relationship must exist. The Robing Ceremony, an academic convocation that had its beginning in 1927, expresses this warm and interdependent relationship bet ween faculty and student. By asking a faculty member to vest her or him, the graduate acknowledges the importance of this crucial interpersonal process. The Hooding Convocation, a companion ceremony for graduate students, is also held previous to commencem ent. These ceremonies have made significant contribution s to the rich heritage of the University and are a vital part of the concluding activities of the student's graduate career. Graduate students eligible for graduation and thereby participation in the Hooding Convocation may select a graduate faculty member who has been meaningful to them for vesting of the Hood at the Hooding Convocation preceding the graduation program. Persons to vest the student must be eligible to wear academic regalia. Persons eligible include all graduate faculty, full or part -time, and staff who hold faculty rank. GRADUATION CEREMONY A graduation or \"commencement\" ceremony is held at the end of spring and fall semesters to honor those students who have completed the graduation requirements for their degree. During the graduation ceremony, specific mention is made of special honors. There is no graduation ceremony at the end of the summer.

This policy may be amended, amplified or withdrawn by the University, in its sole discretion, at any time. Student Complaint Policy POLICY ON WRITTEN ST UDENT COMPLAINTS Texas Wesleyan University recognizes the value of information provided by students about the performance of the University in provid ing the services and meeting the goals which our mission describes. It is University policy to invite feedback, and, whenever possible, to use that feedback to continue to improve the services and functions of the University. Ideally, students will be able to resolve any problems by dealing directly with the individual (such as a faculty or staff member) or office (such as a student service or administrative office) involved. Students should also read the current Texas Wesleyan University Catalog and Stude nt Handbook to become familiar with University policies. These policies include but are not limited to: Academic integrity ; Grade appeal ; Harassment and discrimination ; Student access to records . If a student is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution and wishes to pursue the matter further, or if a student wishes to register a formal complaint, a written complaint may be addressed to the Office of the Provost, following the process outlined here: Written complaints should contain the following infor mation: The complainant's name and contact information; a clear description of the problem or complaint; appropriate supporting documentation that is directly related to the complaint; a description of any subsequent actions taken by the complainant or the University, and; a description of the desired outcome . All written complaints received and copies of any responses will be kept on file in the Office of the Provost. Complaints which are unsigned or are not received in written format (e.g. complaints rec eived by phone or in person) will not be considered. The Provost will respond to each complaint within 15 business days of receipt. If no other action was requested, the response will acknowledge receipt of the complaint . If further action is requested, t he response will describe the actions to be initiated by Office of the Provost and any further information from the complainant that may be required . Texas Wesleyan University 74 Grade Complaints Written complaints about grad es will not be addressed by the Office of the Provost unless the student has already discussed the grade with the course instructor, the department or division head (if any), and the appropriate Dean, respectively. Appropriate documentation would include c opies of the student's coursework, the course syllabus, and any other materials related to specific assignments (such as handouts or correspondence with the instructor). (See Grade Appeal Process, page 8 4.) Non-Academic Complaints Written complaints about administrative or other student services should be directed initially to the appropriate office but may be submitted to the Office of the Provost if satisfactory resolution is not achieved. Appropri ate documentation would include copies of any relevant contracts, notices, or other official or informal correspondence with the office or other University personnel.

Roles of Academic Offices OFFICE OF THE PROVOS T AND SENIOR VICE PRES IDENT The Provost and Senior Vice President serves as the chief academic officer at the University. As such, the Provost acts on recommendations from the deans and directors regarding matters of academic policy, student petitions, and other matters affecting the academic lives of the students of the University. Questions concerning issues of academic policy should be directed to the Office of the Provost. Students seeking counsel on specific academic programs or seeking to address issues affecting their program s hould consult with the program director of their graduate program and the dean of the school in which she/he is enrolled. All petitions for course substitutions, readmission to the University, or other exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Office of the Provost for final determination. ACADEMIC DEANS Texas Wesleyan University is organized into four academic schools: Arts and Letters , Business , Education, and Natural and Social Sciences . Each school is headed by the dean of the school who has primary responsibility for implementing academic policies affecting those schools. Students with questions about programs that are not addressed in this catalog should consult with their program director and/or with the dean of the school. Students seeking alternatives to the stated requirements should consult with the dean of the school or her/his designee. All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the graduate program director of the student's program and the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Concerns regarding the faculty or staff assigned to the respective schools should be addressed to the dean of the school. Texas Wesleyan University 76 GRADUATE PROGRAM DIRECTORS Each graduate program is headed by a graduate program director who has primary responsibility for program implementation for the sc hool. The director coordinates program offerings in conjunction with the dean, admits students in cooperation with the Graduate Admission Office, plans the new student orientation, and serves as initial advisor to the student. Students with questions conce rning academic policy should initially consult with the program director and then the dean of the school. With regard to the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia (GPNA) , there is no appointed dean, and that particular program director reports to and works with the University Provost. UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON GRADUATE PROGRAMS The University Committee on Graduate Programs provides a forum for graduate program issues and academic affairs. The Committee reviews nominations for graduate faculty and the process for the hiring of contributing graduate faculty. It also assesses and evaluates all graduate programs. Membership includes the director of each graduate program, two faculty members from each graduate progr am, one dean from the three schools (term limit one year, non -voting), Provost (ex- officio), Associate Provost (ex -officio), Director of West Library (ex -officio), and Coordinator of Graduate Admissions (ex -officio). GRADUATE FACULTY Appointed Graduate Faculty To be appointed to the graduate faculty, an individual must be nominated according to the graduate faculty appointment policy by her /his dean to the Committee on Graduate Programs . Nominations are then sent to the Provost who in turn makes the appointment . Candidates must have an earned terminal degree (or ABD with satisfactory progress) in the discipline or disciplines of the graduate courses being taught or must otherwise meet accreditation guidelines . It is expe cted that the candidate meet the \"18 hours in a field\" guideline and/or have clinical and/or unique qualifications . They must also demonstrate successful teaching in the discipline, demonstrate scholarly activity at the graduate level, or show progress tow ards scholarly activity at the graduate level, and they must hold the University rank of Assistant Professor, or higher, or the title of administrative faculty in the Graduate Program s of Nurse Anesthesia. Contributing Graduate Faculty Full-time, adjunct, and/or part -time faculty, called contributing graduate faculty, may be invited or assigned to teach graduate courses on a semester by semester basis . The invitation or assignment is made by the dean of the school and a school -based faculty committee, and the process is reviewed by the Committee on Graduate programs. OFFICE OF STUDENT RE CORDS The purpose of the Office of Student Records is to provide secure, efficient storage of permanen t student records and to maintain the integrity of the University Undergraduate and Graduate catalogs. Students rely on the office for a variety of services including registration, schedule changes, verification of enrollment, maintenance of current addres s information, graduation audit, grades, official transcripts, and degree plans. Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 77 Academic Policies ACADEMIC STANDARDS Academic standards are designed to provide close supervision of the program of study and academic progress of a student. Students should refer to the catalog section of their program of study for expected standards. CATALOG A student will normally complete requirements for a degree within the maximum 10 calendar years from the date of initial enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University. A student who has not been in continuous enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University and who re -enrolls after the 10 - year maximum time period has elapsed will complete requirements for a degree under the catalog that is current on the date of re- enrollment. A student who re -enrolls within the 10 -year period should continue with their original catalog unless it is more advantageous to enroll under a more recent one. Exceptions must be approved by the dean of the school. Individual programs may have additional time limitation s. Students may elect to move to a more recent catalog to complete their degree. However, this election to change catalog years will be allowed only onc e. All program requirements in the most recent catalog must be completed. A Catalog Year Change Request Form must be completed and retained in the student's academic file. COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY Basic to success in any academic program is skill in written and oral communication. The student must exhibit a capability in communication as a requirement of any course. Any instructor in any course may require a student who lacks skill in c ommunication to seek assistance. COURSES Auditing Any course may be audited with approval of the instructor. On the first day of class, permission should be obtained from the instructor and the completed audit form submitted to the Office of Student Records. The student will be registered as an audit student and pays an audit fee. The term \"AU\" will appear on the student's transcript . A grade will not be awarded . A student may not change from audit to credit nor credit status to audit after the conclusion of the drop/add period. Change of Schedule (Add/Drop) After registration has been completed, a student may change her/his schedule only during the drop/add period. Courses may be dropped or added only with the permission of the instructor and graduate program director using the \"Change of Course\" form. No course may be added after the first week of classes. Texas Wesleyan University 78 Class Attendance Regular and punctual attendance at all scheduled classes is expected of all students. University regulations authorize certain abse nces of students when represent ing the University (e.g. participation in Intercollegiate athletic competitions, and student government, s tudent development, or fine arts events). Absences that may be necessary to fulfill course requirements and are approved by the Provost are also considered to be authorized . The maximum number of authorized absences during one semester is five for a Monday -Wednesday - Friday class, three for a Tuesday -Thursday class, and two for a class or laboratory meeting once a week. Additional authorized absences may be granted on an individual basis when extreme circumstances warrant (e.g. advancement to and representation of the University at regional or national level intercollegiate athletic, academic, or fine arts competition). Individual faculty may not enforce a more restrictive policy than what is set by the University. Students are required to notify instructors prior to any missed class and will be held responsible for all class and laboratory assignments. Class attendance is vital for student success in the Evening and Weekend Classes, since many classes meet once each week or every other weekend. A student w ho is absent from class must contact the instructor before the absence, if possible. Class absences jeopardize a student's academic success and grade. Each instructor of Evening and Weekend Classes determines the specific attendance policies for the class. Attendance via participation is critical to a student's success in Online and Hybrid Classes . When an online or hybrid class student does not participate in consecutive online activities or does not submit consecutive assignments AND has not communicated with the instructor about the student's participation, the instructor must drop the student from the class using the Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal process. Each instructor determin es the specific number of consecutive activities or assignments that will initiate the withdrawal, according to the requirements of the particular online or hybrid class. Class Load The normal graduate class load is 9 hours and is the mi nimum class load for classification as a full -time student during the fall , spring , or extended summer semester. Summer sessions may be offered in two shorter sessions , in this instance 6 hours per term is the maximum class load for which a student may register. During the fall , spring or extended summer terms , 12 hours is the maximum for which a student may register. Any exception to this must be made with the written permission of the dean of the student's school. The number of hours in which a student enrolls should be carefully considered in consultation with her/his advisor. As a general rule, a full - time class load of 9 hours is a commitment to a 40 -hour week of attendance and out -of-class preparation/assignments. Concurrent Enrollment Texas Wesleyan University students desiring concurrent enrollment must have the written approval of the dean of their school before enrolling at another institution. When a student requests concurrent enrollment, consideration must be give n to the residence requirement. Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 79 Conference Course A conference course is a course taught by an instructor to an individual student. A student may enroll for a conference course only by approval of the instructor of the course, the dean of the school in which the conference course is offered, and the University Registrar. Approval is normally given only when the following requirements are met: (1) a confer ence course may be taken only in the last regular semester or summer term bef ore the graduation of the student; (2) the course requested must be required for graduation; (3) the course is not scheduled to be taught that semester or term; (4) there is a conflict in schedule between two required courses during the last semester or te rm before graduation; and (5) the student must be enrolled in one or more regular courses in the University. An additional fee is charged for conference courses. Course Credit Academic credit assigned to a subject is expressed in seme ster hours. The credit -hour value of each course is indicated by the second digit in the course number. In accordance with federal policy, Texas Wesleyan defines a credit hour as the amount of work represented in the achievement of learning outcomes (verified by evidence of student achievement) that reasonably approximates one hour (50 minutes) of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out -of-class student work, each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or the eq uivalent amount of work over a different amount of time OR at least an equivalent amount of work as required for other activities as established by the institution including internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading toward the awa rd of credit hours. Lecture/Seminar Courses. During an academic semester, one unit of credit is awarded for one hour (50 minutes) of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out -of-class student work each week for approximatel y 15 weeks. Laboratory Courses. During an academic semester, one unit of credit is awarded for two hours (100 minutes) of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of four hours of out -of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks . Four credit hour courses combining lecture and labs are awarded equivalent of the combined three credit hour lecture/seminar and one credit hour laboratory. Independent Study . During an academic semester, one unit of credit is awarded for a minimum of three hours (150 minutes) of work per week for approximately 15 weeks. An independent study must be approved by the Department Chair and Dean and designed based on specific learni ng outcomes that are verifiable through the assessment of student achievement. The student will define the research topic and with the assistance of the faculty sponsor, develop the syllabus, including a course description, learning outcomes, research crit eria, assignments and weekly schedule. Regular, periodic meetings with sponsoring faculty are required. Conference Course. During an academic semester, one unit of credit is awarded for a minimum of three hours (150 minutes) of w ork per week for approximately 15 weeks. A conference course is a regular course taught by an instructor to an individual student and must be approved by the Dean and University Registrar. Texas Wesleyan University 80 Internships . A minimum of 40 hours per unit of credit is required. Host companies must be approved by the Department Chair, and company supervisors must agree to place the student in a position that will benefit not only their organization, but will add to the student's education in a meaningful manne r. Course Descriptions Students should refer to the catalog section pertaining to their program of study. Course Numbering Courses numbered 5000 and above are graduate -level courses. The first digit of the course number indicates course level, the second digit indicates credit hour, and the third and fourth digits give the course sequence. If the content of a course and/or its title changes, a new course n umber may be assigned and students may enroll in the new course to complete a degree requirement requiring the former. The former course number will appear in parentheses, ( ), after the new title in the course listing. Course Substitution or Waiver When a student seeks approval for a change in the degree plan from the requirements stated in the catalog, a substitution or waiver form must be completed. The student, the student's advisor, and the dean must sign this form before it is forwarded to the Office of Student Records to be included in the student's permanent file. A course substitution form is required for all transfer credit . Independent Study An independent study course covers subject matter that is not offered in the University catalog but is of special interest to the student. These courses of independent study or supervised research may be offered for 1 to 4 hours credit. The third and fourth digits in the number listing for these courses will be 50. Approval of the proposed s tudy by the dean of the school, the chairperson of the department, and the instructor who will supervise the study is required prior to registration. A syllabus must be acknowledged by both the instructor and student and a copy kept on file in the dean's o ffice. A maximum of 9 hours of directed study and supervised research will be accepted for graduation requirement. Joint Undergraduate/Graduate Enrollment Undergraduate students with senior standing may register for up to six hours of graduate credit (see 5000 or above series courses in the Gradua te Catalog) with the consent of the dean of their school and the dean of the school in whose program the courses reside/Director of GPNA and the course instructor . Graduate courses applied towards an undergraduate degree may not be applied towards a gradua te degree. Certain courses are cross listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 81 Repeating C ourses Any course taken at Texas Wesleyan University and repeated for a grade must be repeated at Texas Wesleyan University. Any course taken at another institution may be repeated at Texas Wesleyan, and the most recent grade on the course will be counted. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be computed using the most recent grade achieved. The student is advised to notify the Office of Student Records when a course is repeated so that proper grade points can be recorded . Individual program requirements may restrict the repetition of some courses. Special Topics Special topics may be offered at a level of 5000 or higher in any department; credit hours may range fro m 1 to 4 hours. The third and fourth digits in the number listing for these courses will be 99. Approval of the proposed special topics course by the dean of the school is required prior to scheduling the course. This course may be repeated with change of topic. Undergraduate/Graduate Cross -Listed Courses Certain courses are cross -listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross -listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. In cross -listed courses, graduate students must complete additional course requirements in order to receive graduate credit. Withdrawals/Drops Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal from a Course . Unautho rized absences may be excused when caused by illness or other emergencies and should be reported promptly to the instructor. When a student has a number of unauthorized absences equal to the number of days the class meets per week AND has not communicated with the instructo r about the absences within 10 calendar days , the instructor must either drop the student from the class or give a grade of incomplete (I) as appropriate. For evening, weekend, hybrid or online classes, e ach instructor determines the specific number of consecutive activities or assignments that will initiate the withdrawal, according to the requirements of the particular class. The instructor must drop the student from the class using the Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal process. The Registrar will record a grade of \"DP\" for the course on the student's transcript. The Registrar will record a grade of \"WF\" (failure) on the student's transcript if the instructor drops the stude nt after the date for receiving a grade of \"DP\" as specified in the University catalog. Instructors who give a student a grade of incomplete (I) must follow the grading policies set forth in the University Catalog. Any student who successfully completes all outstanding assignments by the prescribed date specified in the Academic Calendar will have the incomplete grade replaced with a grade as determined by the instructor . Any student who does not complete the outstanding assignments by the prescribed date shall have the incomplete grade replaced with a grade of \"F\". Texas Wesleyan University 82 A student who has been absent from any regular examination and has satisfied the instructor that the absence was due to serious illness or other unavoidable cause may take a special examination at the discretion of the instructor concerned. Student Initiated Withdrawal from a Course . A student may drop from a course during the period specified in the University catalog and will have a grade of \"DP\" (dropped) recorded on her/his transcript. A grade of \"F\" (failure) will be assigned if the withdrawal is after the date to receive a grade of \"DP\" as specified in the University catalog. Signature of the instructor, advisor, and University Registrar a cknowledging the withdrawal must be obtained on the withdrawal form . Withdrawal from the University . A student wishing to withdraw from all classes must formally withdraw from the University by completing the withdrawal form available in the Office of Student Records. This form must be signed by the Director of Financial Aid, Cashier, and the University R egistrar. For the withdrawal to be complete, the form must be returned to the Office of Student Records along with the student's identification card. A student who withdraws from the University after the last day to drop a course as specified in the Univ ersity Academic Calendar or who withdraws without following the official procedure will be given the grade of \"F\" in all courses. A student who withdraws from the University is still obligated to pay the tuition and fees incurred at the time of registratio n A student may be dropped from the University when her/his instructors and the dean of her/his school determine that the student is not achieving passing grades in the academic work or for other sufficient causes, including but not limited to poor class attendance, failing to meet program or University ethical, integrity, or other standards. GRADING A grade is assigned for each course in which a student is regularly enrolled. A passing grade may be earned only if the student is enrolled fo r the duration of the course. The following grades are used by Texas Wesleyan University: Grade Description Grade Points A Excellent 4.0 B Above average 3.0 C Average 2.0 D Below average 1.0 F Failing 0.0 P Passing * WF Withdrawal Failing 0.0 * Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA) The following may appear on the transcript in lieu of a grade but are not included in the GPA calculation: AU Audit * CIP Course in Progress * CR Credit * DP Dropped * Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 83 I Incomplete * NR No Grade R eported * T Temporary * W Withdrawal * * Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA) The grade \"I\" (incomplete) is given only when the student's work is satisfactory but, for reasons beyond the control of the student, has not been completed. Both students and instructors should note that an \"I\" is not given in lieu of an \"F\" (failing). It is the responsibility of the student to confer with the instructor of the course and to complete the prescribed requirements of the course by the designated date shown in the University Academic Calendar. For each \"I\" assigned, the instructor will file an Incomplete Grade Form with the Office of Student Records. On or before the designated date, the instructor will assign a grade and r eport it to the Office of Student Records. If a new grade is not reported by the designated date, the \"I\" will automatically convert to an \"F.\" Once an \"F\" is given, it cannot be changed without repeating the course in which it was given. No grade changes may be made after one (1) year from the time the grade was originally issued . This limit also applies to grades issued following completion of an \"incomplete\" (I) grade. The grade \"T\" is a temporary grade assigned if a course extends beyond the regular semester dates. This grade is not used in lieu of an \"I\" but is given to students who are enrolled in courses in which grades will not be available until after the regular semester ends. Examples of such cou rses are Weekend University summer courses, EDU 2300, NSC 1410, and certain courses taken abroad. It is possible for a student to take a maximum of five elective courses (15 hours) toward a degree in which she/he may choose to be graded on a \"P/F\" basis. Courses in which the grades of \"P\" or \"F\" are regularly awarded to all students enrolled do not count among these five courses. Students may not choose to receive a grade of \"P\" or \"F\" in any course that is a general education cur riculum requirement or a specific departmental requirement for a major, a minor, or a certificate. A student may enroll in only one of these five elective courses in any given semester and must have written permission prior to enrolling from her/his major advisor, the instructor, and the dean of the student's major. A factor in determining a student's grade in any course will be competency in the use of written and spoken English. Grade Point Average Grade points are used in computing the grade point averages (GPA) required for admission, graduation, and other scholastic requirements. Grade point averages are computed based on A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F/WF=0. Grade point averages are computed at the end of each semester and at the end of each summer term. The GPA for a particular period is determined by dividing the total number of grade points received by the total number of hours for which the student was enrolled and in which a grade other than \"W,\" \"I,\" \"P,\" or \"T\" was received. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be computed, within the limitations of the student's specific program, using the most recent grade achieved. The student is advised to notify the Office of Student Records when a cours e is repeated so that proper grade points can be recorded. Texas Wesleyan University 84 For courses taken at another institution and repeated at the other institution prior to enrolling at Texas Wesleyan University, the last grade awarded for the course will be shown on the Wesleyan transcript. Grade Appeal Process 1. Students wishing to appeal a grade must do so in a timely fashion. For grades assigned during a semester and which are incorporated into the final grade, the appeal must be initiated before the completion of the semester. For course grades or grades on assignments completed within the last week of the semester, the appeal must be initiated before the end of the following semester. For appeals of grades assigned in the fall semester, a student has until the end of the following spring semester; for grades assigned in the spring, the student has until the end of the following fall semester; for grades assigned during the summer, the student has until the end of the follo wing fall semester. 2. If a student decides to appeal a grade, the student makes an appointment with the instructor for the purpose of discussing the grade assignment. This meeting establishes an appeal. If an instructor is not available because of part -time, sabbatical, or other circumstances, the student may begin with step (3). Under extremely unusual circumstances, grades may be appealed beyond these deadlines. Students should realize that pertinent documentation (e.g. other students' papers) becomes les s readily available as time passes. 3. If the results of the meeting with the instructor are unsatisfactory, the student makes an appointment with the department chair*. 4. The student will bring to the meeting with the department chair a written complaint (a) stating what grade is being appealed and, (b) on what basis it is being appealed. The student should also bring all pertinent materials such as the assignment for which the grade is being appealed, the syllabus for the course, previous grades assigned in the course, etc. 5. The department chair will review the materials and the appeal with the student with the thought of ascertaining the issues involved in the appeal. Add itional information may be requested from the student and/or the instructor. The department chair will attempt to resolve the appeal informally between the student and the instructor. 6. If the appeal cannot be resolved informally, the department chair will meet with the dean to discuss the issues involved and to transmit the documentation developed to that point. The dean will then schedule an appointment with the student and the instructor to discuss the appeal. The dean will have the responsibility to det ermine the merits of the appeal. The dean may request assignments submitted by other students, a review or re -grading of the assignment, and a review of the grade(s) by qualified individuals or other faculty, and/or request other materials as necessary to support a decision. The decision to obtain more information or to refer the case to others is that of the dean. 7. The dean will make a written recommendation to the Provost to approve or deny the grade appeal. 8. If the grade appeal is denied, the student m ay appeal to the Provost as the chief academic officer. The Provost has the responsibility to Academics: Programs, Offices, Policies 85 review the procedures followed in the review process in order to determine if due process was followed. If the grade appeal is approved, the instructor may appe al to the Committee on Faculty Grievances. *If there is no department chair, the appointment is made with the dean and steps (4) and (5) are carried out by the dean. If the grade appeal concerns the department chair, the appointment is made directly with the dean. If the grade appeal concerns the dean, the appointment is made with the Provost. If the grade appeal concerns the Provost, the appointment is made with the President. PETITIONS All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. All petitions for exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Office of Stu dent Records. GRADUATION APPLICATION DEADLINES An application for graduation must be filed in the Office of Student Records during the term prior to completing graduation requirements. November 1 is the application deadline for Spring graduates. April 1 is the application deadline for Fall graduates. If the application deadline falls on a non - business day, applications will be due the next University business day. Certifying applicants for graduation is a labor inten sive process that takes many months . For this reason, late applications are subject to an additional fee. Extreme ly late applications submitted within two months of a graduation date pose further challenges and are charged accordingly . No application will be accepted within three weeks of a graduation date without the review and approval of the Office of the Provost. SCHOOL MANUALS/HANDB OOKS Schools and/or departments may publish manuals or handbooks outlining specific program requirements to supplement the University catalog. Students are expected to follow these policies, as related to their chosen program. Manuals may be obtained from stude nts' graduate program director. TRANSCRIPT REQUEST Students can order official transcripts through the online transcript service at https://txwes.edu/academics/registrar/transcript -request/ . The transcript fee is $5 per electronic copy and $7 per paper copy. Allow 3 - 5 business days for processing. Allow additional time for processing during registration periods or graduation preparation . Realizing that emergencies occur, a student may receive ex pedited processing for an additional $15 and express mailing for an additional fee of $20. Texas Wesleyan University 86 SPECIAL ACADEMIC PROGRAMS Continuing Education The University sponsors a l imited number of continuing education programs that are coordinated through the Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President. These programs are taught by either full - or part - time faculty and staff of the University. Programs include opportunities for leadership training, customer relations, alternative dispute resolution, training for municipal officials, and small business entrepreneurship. Continuing education programs of the University do not lead to the awarding of academic credit. Each program is separately developed and administered. For more information contact the Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President (817/531- 4405). Distance Education Texas Wesleyan University is dedicated to cultivating critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and creative problem solving in its students to prepare them for careers, professional programs, and graduate schools. Texas Wesleyan University also strives to maintain undergraduate and graduate programs that are accessible to working adults. Distance education is central to these aspects of Texas Wesleyan's mission. In providing a high quality education to a diverse community of learners, we are also able to serve the higher education and professional needs of businesses, public schools, and the community as well as enable students to utilize current technologies for professional development. Through distance education, on- campus and off -campus learners can access course related materials, resources, and communication via synchronous (live interactive) or asynchronous (anytime -anywhere) delivery methods using videoconferencing and/or online Internet based services. Students who are enrolled in online courses hav e access to the same campus resources made available to on -campus students. These resources include admissions, counseling and health services, the West library, student services, career services and recreational facilities. The U niversity offers graduate classes by distance education in the following disciplines: Education Nurse Anesthesia Evening and Weekend Classes There is an array of undergraduate and graduate courses from various disciplines that may be found within the class schedule on nights and weekends . Many students take a combination of weekend, evening, and online courses to expedite degree completion. We offer various graduate degrees that may be completed during night & weekend.

MSNA Policies and Expenses BACKGROUND CHECKS & DRUG SCREENS Patient safety is a primary consideration for Texas Wesleyan and all clinical affiliates. Consequently, background checks and drug screening are required for nurse anesthesia training participation. Students will be given instructions on how to complete a required background check with their admission information after they have accepted a position in the program. The background check must be completed using the system put in place by the program between the date of the acceptance letter and July 1st of the year the student is scheduled to start the program. All students may be required to complete and pass a background check at the completion of Phase I to meet the requirements of clinical training facilities. The cost of the initial background check is the students' responsibility. Clinical Affiliates reserve the right to deny training Texas Wesleyan University 196 applicants whose background check is unacceptable as determined by the Anesthesia Department or Hospital Administration. Drug screens will be conducted on a random basis thr oughout the program. Students who refuse or fail a drug screen are not eligible to continue in the program. The Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia follows state board of nursing regulations and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetist guidelines re lated to substance abuse in professional nursing. Substance abuse policies and education curriculum are available in the student handbook NURSE ANESTHESIA PRO FESSIONAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND CLINICAL COMPETENCIES Texas Wesleyan University and the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding its students with disabilities. It is the policy of Texas Wesleyan University that no student shall be denied access to or participation in the services, programs, and activities of the University solely on the basis of her or his disability. However, all students must be able to perform all of the didactic and clinical requirements of the curriculum as well as the physical competency standards with or without reasonable accommodations. Didactic and clinical professional and physical competency standards include: Ability to observe and communicate. Nurse anesthetists must be able to observe, hear, and understand evidence about a patient's status quickly and accurately as well as communicate rapidly and clearly with patients, members of the healthcare team, and othe rs; Physical capabilities and motor skills. Nurse anesthetists are required to move, transfer, and position patients and to locate and arrange equipment as needed; to be sufficiently mobile to provide care to several patients at a time, and to have suffici ent dexterity, hand/eye coordination, and stamina to operate complicated instruments and perform proceedings for prolonged periods as necessary; Cognitive skills and intellectual capacities. Nurse anesthetists are able to understand complex medical information related to patient needs and care; to transcribe and communicate that information quickly and accurately; and to distinguish standard from nonstandard patterns of patient behaviors and responses; Decision making skills. Nurse anesthetists are expected to demonstrate the capacity to gather, organize, assess, prioritize, make decisions, and then act on information appropriately so as to facilitate the prompt and timely delivery of patient care; Behavioral and social attributes. Nurse anesthetists should exhibit professionally appropriate behaviors at all times with patients, members of the healthcare delivery team, and the public. These behaviors include capacities to establish rapport and trust including respect for team roles and norms; to preserve confidentiality; to communicate clearly with patients, other health care providers and the public; to complete work in a timely manner; and to demonstrate commitment to ensuring the quality of and upgrade t he practice of nurse anesthesia; Master's Program s in Nurse Anesthesia 197 Ability to complete above competencies in the work environment. The operating room environment (including all anesthetizing areas) is loud and often chaotic. A nurse anesthesia provider, both CRNA and student, must be able to block out the confusion and maintain his or her p atients' safety. This requires the nurse anesthesia provider to remain focused on the tasks at hand, evaluate and act in a timely fashion and communicate effectively with the other operating room personnel. At times of extreme stress, when the patient requ ires the full attention of the nurse anesthesia provider, additional time and a quiet environment cannot be given.
