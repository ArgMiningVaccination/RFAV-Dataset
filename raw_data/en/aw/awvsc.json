The NIH Research Project Grant (R01) supports a discrete, specified, circumscribed project in scientific areas that represent the investigators' specific interests and competencies and that fall within the mission of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). The R01 is the original, and historically the oldest, grant mechanism used by the NIH to support health-related research and development. Research grant applications are assigned to participating ICs based on receipt and referral guidelines, and many applications are assigned to multiple participating ICs with related research interests. Applicants are strongly encouraged to identify a participating IC that supports their area of research and contact Scientific/Research stafffrom relevant ICs to inquire about their interest in supporting the proposed research project. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the [List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices](http://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-nih-institutes-centers-offices)website. All applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement must propose basic science experimental studies involving humans, otherwise referred to in [NOT-OD-18-212](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-212.html) as \"prospective basic science studies involving human participants,\" that fall within the NIH definition of a clinical trial and also meet the definition of basic research. NIH defines basic research consistent with the definition of basic research in federal code, \"the systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind.\" ( [32 CFR 272.3](https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=362ab86854e9b354eb3404a020a43519&mc=true&node=se32.2.272_13&rgn=div8)). NIH defines a clinical trial as \"A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.\" ( [NOT-OD-15-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html)). Types of studies that should submit under this FOA include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind. For the purposes of this FOA, \"specific application towards processes or products\" refers to the application of biomedical or behavioral products, procedures, or services intended to affect a health-related outcome of the individual or a group of individuals either by better understanding the mechanism of action of an intervention or a measurable improvement in health. Basic experimental studies in which participants are prospectively assigned to experimental conditions and receive an intervention or experimental manipulation where the effect will be assessed for the purpose of understanding fundamental aspects of phenomena may be submitted under this parent FOA. Please refer to the table comparing [Funding Opportunity Types by Clinical Trial Allowability](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/Comparison-of-FOA-Types-Clinical-Trials.pdf) for additional guidance on the most appropriate FOA for the type of study. Prospective studies with humans conducted with specific applications towards processes or products in mind, including FDA Phase 0 or 1 studies, mechanistic clinical trials (e.g., those that examine the mechanisms by which an intervention works or the processes that account for an intervention's effects on clinical outcome), and safety and efficacy studies should submit under the parent 'Clinical Trial Required' FOA, or other 'Clinical Trial Required' or Clinical Trial Optional' FOAs, but not under this FOA. Observational studies involving humans should submit under the 'Clinical Trial Not Allowed' FOA. Applicants are strongly advised to contact relevant [Scientific/Research staff](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/contacts/parent-R01-BESH.html)to discuss the most appropriate mechanisms of support for their studies. Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? [ Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? ] Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project?

Have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? Study Design Is the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? Is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? Given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results? Is the trial appropriately designed to conduct the research efficiently? Are the study populations (size, gender, age, demographic group), proposed intervention arms/dose, and duration of the trial, appropriate and well justified?

Are the procedures for data management and quality control of data adequate at clinical site(s) or at center laboratories, as applicable? Have the methods for standardization of procedures for data management to assess the effect of the intervention and quality control been addressed? Is there a plan to complete data analysis within the proposed period of the award? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? [If proposed, are the administrative, data coordinating, enrollment and laboratory/testing centers, appropriate for the trial proposed? ] Does the application adequately address the capability and ability to conduct the trial at the proposed site(s) or centers? Are the plans to add or drop enrollment centers, as needed, appropriate? If international site(s) is/are proposed, does the application adequately address the complexity of executing the clinical trial? If multi-sites/centers, is there evidence of the ability of the individual site or center to: (1) enroll the proposed numbers; (2) adhere to the protocol; (3) collect and transmit data in an accurate and timely fashion; and, (4) operate within the proposed organizational structure? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Is the study timeline described in detail, taking into account start-up activities, the anticipated rate of enrollment, and planned follow-up assessment? Is the projected timeline feasible and well justified? Does the project incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., CTSAs, practice-based research networks, electronic medical records, administrative database, or patient registries) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment and data collection, as appropriate? Are potential challenges and corresponding solutions discussed (e.g., strategies that can be implemented in the event of enrollment shortfalls)? For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of thecategories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults) to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. For Renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period. For Revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. If the Revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident. Note: Effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023, the Data Sharing Plan and Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS) as part of the Resource Sharing Plan will not be evaluated at time of review. As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s), in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](file:///C:/Users/mckenziene/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/13V4QPZR/Research%20Draft.doc#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications will receive a written critique. Applications may undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review) will be discussed and assigned an overall impact score. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Grantee institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. [Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). ] All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Not Applicable Data Management and Sharing Note: The NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing is effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023. Consistent with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.2.3_sharing_research_resources.htm#Data). Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreementsare required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
