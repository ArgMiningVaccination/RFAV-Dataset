Discover why and how the rose balances the heart, mind, and emotions.", "sitename": "mapi.com", "date": "2022-09-06", "cleaned_text": "According to the Ayurvedic texts, it's not a coincidence that the rose is associated with romance, because it balances Sadhaka Pitta, the subdosha of [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-pitta-dosha) that governs the emotions and their effect on the heart. Sadhaka Pitta can go out of balance more easily in summer, when the hot, humid weather increases all aspects of Pitta dosha, the mind-body operator that governs heat, digestion, and metabolism in the body. The rose has been traditionally used in Ayurveda for thousands of years to soothe the mind, heart, and emotions. Its soothing scent, moisturizing oils, and medicinal properties makes it a multi-purpose treasure for uplifting the heart, and the whole body. Traditional uses of the rose Even though there are hundreds of varieties of wild and cultivated roses, it is only the Rosa Centifolia that is used in Maharishi Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic name for this particular rose is shatapatri, meaning \"a hundred petals,\" and the Latin name also means \"a hundred petals.\" In Maharishi Ayurveda, the rose is used in many rasayanas, the herbal formulas that promote overall health and longevity. The rose enlivens inner beauty, helps the skin to radiate inner glow out to others, and enhances all seven dhatus (body tissues). When used over time, the essence of rose pacifies the heat in the blood, and thus keeps imbalances in the skin from erupting. There are some specific ailments that are helped by the rose. These include amenorrhea (absence of menstrual flow), inflamed eyes, dizziness, headache due to Pitta aggravation, sore throat, enlarged tonsils, nervousness, grief, dullness of the skin and acne caused by Pitta imbalances. For these conditions, it's best to rely on a physician trained in Maharishi Ayurveda to prescribe treatments. Organic Rose Petal Spread: A treat for the heart One traditional preparation of the rose is found in [Organic Rose Petal Spread](https://www.mapi.com/products/organic-rose-petal-spread). It contains dozens and dozens of dried rose petals, making it a concentrated, potent means for balancing the emotions. The recipe for this delightful confection can be traced back to a time when royalty gave jars of rose petal spread to their beloved if they wanted to inspire unconditional love. Later, the tradition evolved into our present-day habit of giving roses on Valentine's Day or just to say \"I love you.\" Organic Rose Petal Spread actually acts as a powerful tonic for the heart. By balancing Sadhaka Pitta, it enhances positive emotions, and intensifies the experience of happiness and bliss. An Ayurvedic expert from The Council of Maharishi Ayurveda Physicians has the following to say about the blissful preserve: \"When I come across a person who is feeling emotionally insecure, a little suspicious or sad for no reason, I recommend that the person take 1-2 teaspoons of Organic Rose Petal Spread before thinking more about the problem. This immediately pacifies Sadhaka Pitta and right away the person starts to think more positively.\" Organic Rose Petal Spread can be added to recipes such as [sweet lassi](https://mapi.com/blogs/recipes/sweet-rose-petal-lassi) to make a delicious summertime drink.
