High in antioxidants and rich in colourless carotenoids, this powerhouse in a pill is made from special, non-GMO crystal tomatoes in a unique formulation supported by a decade of research. Our formulation includes the amino acid L-cysteine, which boosts the liver's production of Glutathione, an antioxidant that converts eumelanin or brown pigment to pheomelanin or pink pigment. Skin becomes rosy, supple, and younger-looking. It is also one of the few amino acids that contains sulphur, which binds with protein to form collagen, an anti-ageing building block for healthy, youthful skin. Recommended by dermatologists. Safe and effective, with no preservatives and no harmful side effects, PER BOX: 30 CAP "}
