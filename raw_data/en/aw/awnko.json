Dr. Johnson is very knowledgeable about his craft in helping people with their particular problems. I would suggest to anyone needing chiropractic care to try Johnson Chiropractic because they helped me numerous times to feel my best Dr J has been maintaining my lower back for over 20 years. I would get stabbing pains while sitting. I see Dr J once a month, it is well worth my time. I highly recommend his clinic! He has a traction bed, a soft table, a breakaway table, acupuncture, laser therapy, and a state of the art x ray to computer measuring system. I pay as I go, no pre pay plan for me thank you. He fixed my issues, and maintains them wonderfully! No more lower back pain! Respectfully, Rex Dr.johnson helped me with my vision issues when I was going to vision therapy, it helped a lot. As I go for my back now.. i feel great Everytime I walk out the of the place. He's helped a lot for my mom and step dad and two brothers and I especially don't know how to thank him enough "}
