Hometown Chiropractic Center, 1338 N. 4th St., was started from a previous Allied Health Clinic in 2015, and Innate Life, LLC purchased Hometown on Feb. 10, 2023. A release from the Chamber said Dr. Kelley Rose Milcarek joined Hometown on May 8, 2017 as a Doctor of Chiropractic. Milcarek specializes in pediatric and prenatal care, hold certificates in both specialties, including Webster technique, Pediatric Experience and craniosacral technique for infants. She has also taken a number of technique courses from experts in both fields, the Chamber said. The Chamber said that after graduating from a high school in the western suburbs of Chicago in 2008, Milcarek \"sought the small town, natural settings of Wisconsin,\" going on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Geoscience Environmental Analysis from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point in Dec. 2011. \"Dr. Kelley recognized that she had a passion for helping and healing others,\" the Chamber noted. She enrolled at National University of Health Sciences (NUHS) in Lombard, Ill., and earned her Doctor of Chiropractic degree in Dec. 2016, graduating cum laude. \"Dr. Kelley always felt conflicted with the fact that conventional medicine targets symptoms, rather than causes,\" the Chamber stated. \"Her belief that there had to be better methods than pharmaceuticals led her to chiropractic treatments.\" Since starting her journey at NUHS, Milcarek found a passion for chiropractic and all that it encompasses: subluxations, nutrition, lifestyle modifications and preventative care. The Chamber said Milcarek is always excited to share her knowledge and be an active community member. Milcarek has been a board member of the Hatchet Booster Club since 2011 and has been on the Tomahawk STAR Foundation Board of Directors since 2022. She was also a Tomahawk Extended Area Partners in Education (TEAPIE) board member from 2017 until the group's disbandment last year. The Chamber noted that Innate also does events for Kinship of Tomahawk, including the Dr. Bobbi Voermans Memorial Golf Outing, being hosted for the third time this year on Sunday, Aug. 13. Innate also puts on a Thanksgiving dinner for all the mentors and Kinskids and hosts the Food Fight every November to help fill the Kinship pantry before Thanksgiving. In her spare time, Milcarek loves spending time outdoors, camping, hiking, fishing, kayaking and exploring Wisconsin's lands and waters. She also enjoys traveling, having been to over 15 countries and over half of the United States. Milcarek is very close with her family, being the oldest of three children. She and her husband, Ryan, reside in Tomahawk with their cat, Stella, and their chocolate lab, Willow. "}
