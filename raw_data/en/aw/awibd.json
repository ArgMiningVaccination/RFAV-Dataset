It is a complex and sophisticated science of purification of the body/mind channel systems, and is therefore best supervised/performed by an Ayurvedic physician. The medical scriptures of Ayurveda give the example of a diseased person's body as a soiled cloth, unable to accurately render the dye colors. To succeed in assimilating the true color, the cloth must first become clean. A strict diet and lifestyle is to be followed throughout various stages of treatment. This is to bring back the AGNI (Digestive fire) to its normal levels of functioning. Ayurvedic herbal based medicines are administered to rejuvenate the body or to treat the diseases, if any. During different phases of Panchakarma, these restrictions are to be observed: - Avoid exposure to extreme temperatures, both internally and externally. - Avoid loud noise& stress. - Rest when tired. - Avoid suppression of natural urges such as sneezing, coughing, micturition, bowel movements etc. - Avoid being awake late at night. - Avoid indigestible foods; favor foods that balance the doshas. - Avoid strenuous exercise.
