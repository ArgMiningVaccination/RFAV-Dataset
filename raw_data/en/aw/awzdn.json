Involve your children in meal planning, shopping and food preparation so they get encouraged and take interest in food and eating. - Doctors may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink for picky and choosy eaters who refuse to add new foods to their diet. - Serve smaller portions as children have small stomachs.
